 Well, statistically it is not as bad as you think it is.  Here is my very specific example: I used to live in Louisa County, Iowa which is in Tornado Alley.  There was one time in the 14 years I was there that several tornados came through.  0 fatalities.  Here is the hard data: http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado/Iowa/Louisa/table  




 The assistant principal at my high school outlawed purses on the basis that carrying them was sexist against boys (although there was no rule that they couldn't.... they would just have to put up with harassment from their male peers....).  So my sister and her friends threaded a string through tampon boxes and wore them as purses while they dragged their car keys behind them on another string.  Believe it or not, the rule against purses stopped being enforced.  This is some cheek, I can't believe it worked.  Back in my day, I just carried a billfold that constantly fell out of my inadequate female pockets.  




 A toad.  I was camping and I saw this toad hopping towards the fire pit.  I fished him out as quick as I could but his back legs were all melted and he was chirping.  I set him down and stomped him as hard as I could as an act of mercy.  I still feel guilty.  




 If you wrap your warm soda can in a wet paper towel before you put it in the freezer for 20 minutes, it will be consistently cold rather than that kind-of sort-of cold you get normally.  (Always set a timer on your phone when putting sodas in the freezer, dear ones.) 




 Sorry for being redundant! :) 




 I'm sincere but not serious whenever I joke around with my dementia patients in Hospice.  Obviously dementia is not funny, but when we laugh together, it's not so scary for a moment.  




 This isn't exactly what you're asking, but I think it's pretty funny in retrospect.  My ex-boyfriend let his mother think I took his v-card, so she was pretty much awful to me (the son thief who turned him on to premarital sex).... I'm not sure what she thinks he was doing at college for three years.   




 TROLL ALERT.... LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THIS IS NOT A DRILL.  WE HAVE A TROLL. 

Edit: This is very ironic... So many people upset about how feminists don't call out extremists in their own group, and yet I'm getting downvoted.  Oh, Reddit, do you really know what you want?  




 Right, I don't claim to have all the answers.  What I took issue with is the statement (that you did not make) that women only claim feminism when it benefits them.  I don't believe this to be the case.  A lot of "feminist issues" are merely human issues, and, indeed, a lot of men's issues happen to be feminist issues.  You offered an example of when women failed to pull the feminist card so to speak.  I refuted it with a very specific example.  I am not a feminist when it is convenient.  I help where I can.   




 Well, you're setting a great example for how to take another road.  I'm not on the same page as you are, but you made me stop and examine what it is I believe, and that is a beautiful thing.  Thank you for being respectful and for taking the time to try to enlighten people.  I appreciate you.  




 I am so sorry for what I'm about to say here, because it's not something that can be proven, it is merely anecdotal, but any man who thinks that a girl need only cry "rape" and ruin his life has very little first hand experience with how things actually work.  I'm sorry to say that when my best friend went to our FEMALE HR director because her boss sent her unsolicited messages on Facebook about his sex dreams about her (he being married and twice her age), her exact words to my male boss was "There was something more going on there, she was pursuing him, I'd bet my life." She was pursuing an overweight, bald man with a wife and three children.  She was asking to be put in a situation where she had no idea what to do and agonized over whether to get help for over a month.  She was forced to remain under this man for almost a year until she was promoted beyond him.  She wasn't raped.  This isn't comparable to a rape.  But think about Brandon Teena.  A female to male transgender person who was raped by two men.  Look into how successful he was when he tried to get help. 




 This was sheer brilliance.  




 Edit: Sorry, I thought I was talking to the same person the whole time here.

Shutupharu: I'm glad you're giving me a chance to explain.  Direct combat wasn't something that women were allowed into without fighting for that right.  It's a job with a high probability of fatalities and we fought to do it. :)

Monty 845: I don't think that what you're suggesting is altogether reasonable, you see, I don't want to put my life in peril, but I'm quite sure that if I did, I could apply for a job on an oil rig.  However, I'm sure I wouldn't be physically capable of doing the job.  Do I think that the job should be made easier for me?  Absolutely not.  Full disclosure: I would rather be carried out of a burning building than dragged out by a woman, BUT do I think that a woman shouldn't be turned away without giving her a chance to prove herself?  Absolutely.  You see?  We're not all crazy.  




 I think it is very admirable that you can view a terrible experience as a positive lesson.  I'm also glad that you were able to come to terms with your rape.  I'm sure you're a vibrant and interesting person who deserves to be happy.  Thank you for existing.  




 I know you're not going to do this, but I encourage you to look into sexual assault statistics for the U.S. Armed Forces, and then to remember that until very recently, all assaults were to be reported to your direct commanding officer (you know, the person that would be reprimanded for that kind of behavior going on within their contingent).  Before I get accused of being callous of assaults on men, I'm absolutely not.  It breaks my heart that so many of them suffer in silence thanks to the idea that one of the worst things you can be in this society is "a little bitch." 




 I'm sorry that that happened to you.  Truly.  




 I am now going to systematically upvote all your comments everywhere to show my sisterly support of you.  Yes really.  Don't thank me, it's not about me.  It's about you.  I only wish I could do more.  




 Very eloquently put. I dislike the misconception that feminist issues only affect women positively.  Men are nearly twice as likely to commit suicide and that has not a little to do with the myths that men are not allowed to be anything other than hyper-masculine.  I've never seen a feminist cheer when they read a story about a young man being raped by an adult women, that's a feminist issue too.  I sincerely hope that your optimism is borne out.  Thank you for your thoughtful and brave response.  




 Can I just say I like your swagger?  I'm crying out of one eye now. 




 Put the bunneh back in the bahx.  




 Con Air.  SOOOO GOOOD SOOOO BAD. 




 "Mind your p's and q's" is actually supposed to mean "Mind your pints and quarts," meaning don't get drunk and pick fights with people.  Most folks think it means "Be polite." 




 His heart is in the right place.

 Go outside... Chew some gum... walk as fast as you can while you chew the gum.  I bet your rage doesn't last ten minutes.  This works for heading off a panic attack too.  




 If you get one from me, I either agree with what you're saying, find you well spoken, was entertained, or appreciate your support.  Getting one seems 100% random.  You never know what redditors will like, it seems.  




 What are the Basement Jaxx for 300?  




 "I'm sorry that no one has responded to this question yet. I don't exactly fit the bill for what you're asking, but I am a volunteer who spends about six hours a week as a companion in Hospice. In our training, we are taught to encourage whatever the person is feeling. If they are angry, yeah! You be angry! If they are sad, we are to cry with them. If they can't really communicate, we're to hold their hand and just let them know we're here and we care. We had a speaker come in and share that the four most important things we can say to someone who is dying are "I love you," "Thank you," "I'm sorry," and "I forgive you." This dovetails nicely with what you're asking. The best way to come to terms with your own death is to live a life where if you were killed tomorrow, you wouldn't wish you had said any of these things. Don't wait. Just be brave and live." 




 Reading an interview with Billy Corgran without making this face: :-/ 




 I upvoted this, but I think you mean staying happily married to someone who is famous.  Why do they even bother getting married?  What is the point, I ask?  




 The pages of a book! Nothing better. :) 




 I think that the one thing about it that really got to me was the rage in the rebuttal against people saying they care about the health of people they don't know personally.  I think that all life is precious, and my anxiety tends to focus on death a lot.  One of the ways I struggle is when people don't hide their internal machinery well.  Just as I get nervous around people who work out too much and wear their veins sticking out, I get nervous around obese people because eating is the ultimate proof of mortality.  If you get hungry, you are going to die and that is very sad.  Is it such a bad thing to not want people you know personally to die?  Why wouldn't you believe that I care?  The heart is such an uncomfortable concept even in a healthy person, but the fact that I knew a person who was so morbidly obese their heart failed trying to beat against the back of his ribcage is terrifying for me.  I don't want that for anyone.  (I'm sorry, I know this was 100% weird, but it was also serious.)  




 Read.  Reading makes you more emphatic, thoughtful, introspective, knowledgable, and kind.  If you simply can't go out and experience things first hand, you can always read about them until you get to that point.   




 That divorce is a sad thing.  For example, Neil Young and Peggi Young getting divorced after 30 years of marriage.  At first I was like how sad, but now I'm like, you know, Peggi is nearly 70, Neil is obviously cranky (yes brilliant, but c'mon you know he is cranky as fuck), good for her! Go be free!  See new people and do what you want!  GO!  




 Saxondale. 




 If you aren't selected for trial, you're on call for two weeks. Hope this helps!  




 Almost every piece that was featured in the Granta issue "Betrayal" has stuck with me.  It forced me to think about a lot of really uncomfortable things.   




 I used to have these super graphic violent dreams about animals.  The worst one starts with me coming out of a stall in a mall restroom and there was this overweight lady torturing a dachshund with a taser.  I left the restroom and there where these people all crowded together in a circle.  When I pushed my way in, I saw that they were trying to tear this toucan apart with their hands.  The toucan was jerking his head and making this clicking noise in his throat and he had a tear coming out of one of his eyes.  It fucked me up for a very long time. I can still hear that clicking sound.    




 Lots of people dip their jelly toast points into a fried egg.  I just make a fried egg and jelly toast sandwich.  




 Jeremiah Johnson 




 I don't know about best ever, period, the end, but the best acted scene I've ever seen is Robert Redford at the end of Jeremiah Johnson when Bear Claw observes that the "Winters run long up here."  The sheer amount of pain that man managed to get into a "Yeah," it fucking rends my heart every time.  BRAVO REDFORD, Bra-VO. 




 This doesn't ruin my day, but it annoys the fuck out of me: If the CEO's phone rings three times with no answer, it rolls to me.  People will wait until it rolls to me and then hang up.  This leaves a stupid missed call icon on my phone that I can only get rid of by calling them back.  




 You click your username and then pick the downvoted tab. 




 I don't think so.  Here is why: I once encountered a boy who was not very solicitous or interesting or funny or even a good sport.  He was not conventionally attractive, in fact he was a bit overweight and kind of looked like a penguin.  But when I would sit down next to him, I would get hyper, mega turned on.  I couldn't sleep next to him, I was too aroused.  It had to be pheromones.  I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that he had no similar reaction to me.  I think the real question is how much of any of this had to do with the fact that I'd been on hormonal birth control for five years at that point.     




 Too cold to snow.  




 The question was "Something that sounded great in theory and was fucking terrible in practice." My response was breastfeeding.  Apparently the plight of new mothers is extremely unpopular.   




 I just checked the parent company's website and the only thing we're looking for is in Hartford for an engineer.... I pulled up a lot of results by just looking for "call center CT" in Google, I'd do that since I don't know specifically what city you're in. :) 




 I used to work for an outsourcing call center (this isn't telemarketing, it's mostly utility company customer service), and I can tell you that call centers offer an awful lot of upward mobility.  My former boss only had a GED and he's making well over $60k a year as the call center manager.  He started as an agent on the phones.  I was there for five years, was promoted four times, and was making $20.18/hr when I left.  I wish you good luck, sir! :)

Edit: I should say "Call Center Manager" is a title. It sounds like he was just a general type manager reading it again... He wasn't, he over saw the team of 12 major supervisors and all of their team leads, who were responsible for 300+ employees under them.  He ran the whole center and sometimes more than one location. I figured I should clarify. :) 




 How would I know? I'm an American!  Good job, media ban! :) 




 The 9 times tables.  Or any other times table come to that.  




 He made a blog for the sole purpose of complaining about me, describing our break-up as "harrowing."  I promise I didn't try to push him off a cliff.  




 No! Who the hell is Russel Williams?  If he's under a media ban, it's working!  




 Hey, thank you!  I'm not, but I like to write them occasionally.  I'm also fond of this one, although it is not on topic : Cactus in sweater / Never to be cold again / in the starry night 

or how about this one about how my mom hates carnies? : Sticky hand pulls me / seeds rattle in sweaty cup / do not talk to them

Obviously I don't take myself very seriously, but my post was supposed to be about how the world calls to you and your family calls to you and you need to remember you belong to both. :) 




 I'm with you.  I steadfastly believe that folks who don't like eggplant don't know you're supposed to press them.  They're amazing!   




 I have seen them all, and I don't like any of them.  Apart from uniformly suffering from pacing issues, he just can't seem to help himself when it comes to cheeky jokes within his films.  He just seems so damn pleased with himself!  Also, three of his most famous films completely missed the point of the reference material thanks to his casting choices.  That is very upsetting to me.  




 Oh, ANYTHING by Stanley Kubrick.  




 Stars bright over house / Warm light from inside places / They shine for you too 




 How about the most awkward thing I do on a consistent basis?  If you text me and I don't want to talk to you or wish you didn't have my number, I'll respond with "Who is this?" 




 I'm going to be telling people about this side-quest where I gain a severed arm as a weapon for the rest of my life.  So far, it's been true.  I'm doing it now.  HagtagGimblesProsthetics.  




 If by best you mean so bad it's almost good, probably the date-rape montage in Dahmer which featured "More, More, More," as the soundtrack.  




 Saxondale. 




 For me, it is explaining something totally implausible by throwing in that there was another dimension at the last possible moment.  I'm looking at you, Clive Barker.  




 I'm not really sure what you're looking for from me since our experiences are very, very different.  I can't go back in a time machine and make my interactions as a person working for a Fortune 500 subsidiary that happened to use a temp agency any different from what they are.  Our entry level employees are paid $8.50 when they hit the door.  We pay $16.50 an hour to the temp agency for people who temp in those same positions.  Obviously if we can buy out their contract, it's better to do so as soon as possible.  We have to pay that hourly fee while we train them, a time when they are not generating any profit for our company.  I'm sorry you feel you need to argue with me, but maybe the area we live in plays a factor here.   




 Just look up Luke Magnotta on Wikipedia.  I was serious.  




 While I appreciate that you have a very strong opinion that is likely rooted in experience, it happens to be at odds with what I've seen.  It's definitely true that places are not obligated to hire on a temp, they're paying a premium for  your work and have already had to eat training costs.  You'd be a much better candidate than a person off the street would be, having come from a temp agency for that reason alone.   




 1 lunatic 1 icepick is totally real.  




 100%, although after Stephen Collins, I'm seriously worried it's going to be the next equality frontier.  I can just hear it now.... "I was born this way..." "I don't actually harm children...." 




 It was yesterday.  I asked for help in building a set-up to play vinyl records within my specific budget.  I'm happy to say I put in an order that night.  Thanks, Reddit!  




 I am a big advocate of researching cooking techniques before you start, but if it's too late for that, use a cooking thermometer.  Safe internal temps are different for each kind of product.  :) 

If you don't have one, as a last resort, pick a really thick item you've cooked, cut into it.  If the juice is clear instead of red, you're good.  




 My advice is actually to sign on with a temp company.  Temp companies are used to extremely high employee turnover, so they tend to skip doing background checks.  Because a temp agency is supposed to run a background check, the company you are matched with will likely not do one.  This is how my former company ended up with several level 1 sex offenders on the payroll.  Let my disturbing experience be your boon!  Best of luck to you... It's awesome that you're so driven. :) 




 I think a better question is why is Neil Young still Canadian when he's lived in California the vast majority of his life?  Can you answer this OP?  I'm dead serious.   




 I know that you guys do media freezes for atrocious crimes.  The average American has no idea who Paul Bernardo is, and definitely have never heard of Luke Magnotta, which is crazy when you think about it.  




 Thanks for being a good sport. ;-)

 I love it when a man isn't afraid of asking about things he doesn't understand.  Wanting to learn is very sexy and it connotes that you understand that seeking knowledge is always more important than saving face.  If you don't know what "loquacious" means, ask me! I would love to explain it to you. :) 




 I like your style. 




 I actually don't care, so long as it isn't what it is.  Before and after I'm married, my name is unique to the entire planet (or at least folks searchable on the internet), meaning if you know my damn name, you can find me.  This has happened. 




 I thought of a good one... My mom once said to my cousin Jason that he could go into the basement and have Hot Sex with Grandma.  She was down in the basement drinking Hot Sex which I think is sort of like Bailey's.  He turned so red you could've fried an egg on his head.  




 Hardcore Pawn.  (Which in no way stops me from watching it.) 




 Well, I wish I could agree with you, but American Tabloid was the last straw for me.  These days, I'd take a good Southern Gothic over any gumshoe story.  Thanks for the banter! :)  




 Since you mentioned Black Dahlia.... Teddy bears with locks of children's hair taped between their legs? 




 You start knitting and wait for her to approach you because you're that interesting guy who isn't afraid to knit. 




 Start knitting.  Go to your local yarn shop and knit.  Blog about knitting.  You will not believe how many cute girls knit these days.  I follow 15 boy knitters on Tumblr just because they are boys who knit. None of them happen to like girls, but you see.... there's a niche here.  You only need google "Ryan Gosling knitting" to see what the hell I'm talking about. 




 In this blog, he described our break-up as "harrowing."  I mean, at that moment, part of me was like "Don't be so dramatic," but part of me was like "Yesss, he thinks I am Liam Neeson."  




 I'm walking to a meeting I'm already late for.  I have to present at the meeting, but I'm not prepared and it involves math.  I'm stuck behind someone who is walking very slowly.  They are wearing flip-flops that they are dragging across the floor.  They are also whistling.  While all of this is happening, I'm wearing pantyhose and an ill-fitting outfit.  It's 90 degrees inside with 60% humidity.  




 How has no one said eggnog?  If you drink a whole carton of eggnog, you will regret it with your body and your soul.  Just ask my husband.  




 A subscription to Granta.  Every issue challenges me to think about things I never have before and to examine my reactions closely.  




 Almost anything for your infant. Almost.  




 I went back and looked at every letter and e-mail and chat history and birthday card I ever exchanged with him.  Looking at everything in order as a cohesive progression allowed me to come to conclusions I had avoided before.  By the time I was done, I realized I never wanted to be with him at all, I just wanted to be him.  I felt that he was what I could be if I weren't afraid.  He was me without limits.  




 I'm a woman, and my contribution is slipping into a hot bath when you're really cold.  




 Me and the unsightly callous on my right ring finger approve of your contribution.  




 Anything where people employ aggressive upselling.  Cable, insurance, funeral services. 




 Backstory aside, let me tell you for future reference, that yes, a teenage girl could absolutely get pregnant the day before her period.  A woman's cycle especially when she is young, can be far from consistent.  There is a possibility that it's not a period at all but implantation spotting.  You should be practicing safe sex if you don't want to impregnant someone.  It's as simple as that.  




 Red Velvet Oreos. 




 That is so rude, outting me like that!  




 Dr. Pepper.... Did you know that Dr. Pepper is actually owned cooperatively by Pepsi and Coke?  Read about the Soda Wars of the 90's.  Fascinating stuff.  




 I would think since I'm 105 lbs and a C-cup you would be like, o bby, bring your neurosis over here.  Tell me more about how you like to count things.  




 All of our survival instincts are suddenly not allowed.  You can't run away.  As a female, I find police to be terrifying.  









 Hello;
Does anyone know off hand why the Pro-Ject is a better choice and thus higher price than the TEAC? 
Thank you for your help! :)  




 Hello; I'm looking to buy a full set up for about $800, with a bit of wiggle room.  Can you please suggest what would be the best use of my money?  Thank you... this is way overwhelming!  
























 There are a lot of little tricks you can use to help you feel better when you are depressed.  Set a small attainable goal for yourself.  Like baking a cake from scratch.  Focus on researching the perfect recipe, focus on going out and getting the ingredients, measure and check for advice on good techniques.  You make that cake.  You eat some of that cake.  Think of your next challenge.

The best friend of depression is inactivity.  We feel tired and so we think what we want is to lie down and not think, but we just feel sick at the end of the day.  And we think, and think and think.  If you focus on doing something, any little thing, you can get out of your head.  If you can't manage to do it for yourself, read.  Read a novel.  Be someone else.     




 My advice is to:

Travel (See this world that holds no charms for you!)

Volunteer (Do things out of the goodness of your own heart with no selfish motives.)

Make goals for yourself (See it as a challenge, play a game with yourself.  You seem pretty bright to me, or at the very least well-written... how far can that take you?  Can you trick someone into giving you a job you're not qualified for?  Can you write a novel?  Can you learn to cook a perfect macaron?)

MOVE.  (For the love of god, don't lie on the couch or sit in front of your computer all day.  Go out, go out in public.  People watch, laugh, see the sights, move your body.)

The world really is a beautiful, strange place.  We only get to live in it one time and there is a good chance that there is nothing after.  Try to reach inside and find that part of you that is curious about how things work, that can laugh at absurdities.  Try to find someone who understands you.  Try to find the things that appeal to you.  Please live.  I don't know you, not at all, but I would still be very sad if you died.    




 The only thing that I think you may need to plan for is whether ME has a great need for game wardens post-grad.  You may need to move to do what you love.  Never pay more than the minimum on your loans once you graduate, there is no point.  Save every spare dime you have for a down payment on your house and start establishing your credit.  You do that by paying for things (meaning bills) on time consistently and by opening at least one line of credit.  Once you're in the workforce, don't forget to put some money into your retirement.  It's very important to start that early. :)

Good luck, I like what you're saying here.   




 I think the determining factor is how important your family is to you.  Some people are very family oriented and are happiest living near them, I'm one of those people.  If I were you, I would regret not moving home.  Money is one of those things that's very transient.  As they say "If you wait until you have enough money to have a baby, you will never have a baby."  A pay cut is something you'll figure out if it means being near your family.

Now if you're not that close to your family, you've got the right idea.  You need to identify if you're happy with your current situation, and if you're not, do things to make it what you want!  Remember, we can literally die at any moment, annnnny moment at all.  Think, if I were to die tomorrow, would I regret anything or would I die peacefully?  Do what you can to deal with any regrets you think you might have. :)  




 Hello!

A few things:

-Make sure your resume isn't from a template, you want it to be unique looking in style, professional but memorable!

-When applying, always write a cover letter for your resume.  Consider acknowledging that you don't have a lot of history, but that your drive and skills are a great fit for the company and they only need interview you in person to see how passionate you are to being part of their team.  Be earnest if that's who you are!

-Volunteer.  If you need something for a resume but don't have years of work history to illustrate your talents, volunteer in fields related to what you want to do.

Hope this helps! :) 




 The tone of this complaint is very disturbing.  You're calling his behavior gross, insinuating that you've been confronting him, accusing him of being lazy, admitting that you've been locking things up from someone you're supposed to be taking care of... 

You're the epitome of an unreliable narrator, but if what you're saying *is* true, he's probably acting out because negative attention is better than no attention at all.  

Listen, children who come from broken homes are not always easy to deal with.  They may not come to you with open arms and open hearts and that has nothing to do with you personally.  You're clearly dealing with inadequacy issues to be this defensive towards someone who is so much younger than you.  You need to shelve it.  Be the bigger person, the adult.  Make up your mind to love him no matter what, no matter how hard it is, no matter if you're ever thanked, no matter if he looks just like your husband's ex-wife.  Just choose.  Choose the right thing.  Even if he never lets you in, being a kind, good person to someone who needs that in their life is its own reward.  I really hope you can turn this around.    




 You need to cut that emotional extortionist out of you life.  Block her number, change your e-mail address, cut her out!  

You do not need someone like this in your life, no one deserves to be treated like less than a human being and from what you've put here, that's just what she's doing.  

I'm not sure what exactly to say about how you can get back up, since I don't know much about your life situation (Are you graduating high school soon?  Terribly depressed?  Considering a move?  Stuck at home?), but if you would like to discuss any of that privately, please don't hesitate to shoot me a PM and I'll do my best to help you work through whatever.  
 




 First of all, you should never apologize for working towards what you've wanted the most all your life.  You're a hard working, driven individual who should be lauded.... a wonderful example for the people around you.  Don't feel guilty.  This is your life.  You have to be your own advocate.

You don't need to break it off, and I know I'm about to say one of the worst words in the relationship lexicon, but here we go: Give him the ultimatum.  Just tell him in an organized, calm manner what you basically explained here: You have been working your whole life to build a wonderful career and life for yourself away from this place that holds so many bad memories for you.  That you want the very best for yourself and your family, and that means being in a place where you can excel professionally and personally.  That you want him to be your family more than anything, but you just can't go home.  

He's probably going to break things off, maybe even for a bit, but he'll probably also come back.  And if he doesn't?  You'll know for sure that it wasn't meant to be.  He'll have done you a favor.  We always want what is best for the people we love.  If he really can't be happy unless he's home, and you can't be happy back at home, the two of you need to find happiness apart, but the truth is that a lot of times, guys just fear change.  He may well just give in when you make it clear that his refusal to move forward will cost him his relationship with you. 




 You either owe your friends an apology or you're being paranoid (so an apology isn't going to hurt).  I would just reach out via a text or an e-mail or even on the phone if you care a lot, a lot about that person and say something to the effect of "I wanted to apologize to you for not being as available as I've been in the past.  Your friendship is very important to me, so I want to make it very clear that while this in no way excuses my carelessness, it has everything to do with my wedding and the move and nothing to do with how I feel about you.  When all this is done, we should get together; I promise not to say one word about me.  I miss you and I'll see you soon."  Follow it up with a few random texts here and there between your apology and the wedding.  Nice things like "I saw an interview with George Clooney this morning, and it reminded me of that time, blah blah blah. You're great."  Just let them know they're on your mind. :) 




 The best way to handle stage fright and to make your speech better (not to mention get those extra points for time) is to practice your speech in its entirety, aloud, and time it.  You don't need to have an audience, although a tester will be able to give you pointers.  Hope this helps!   




 When you say "live on your own" do you mean you want to buy a house?  




 I met my husband at work.  Initially he was above me in the company, but I was not one of his reports.  Eventually I was promoted beyond his role.  A lot of people within the company had no idea we were married.  We made it a point to not be affectionate at work.  We talked about work related things when we needed to.  We had to go to meetings together and sometimes worked on assignments together.  It is important to report your relationship to your HR representative.  They will decide if your immediate supervisor needs to know.  Just keep it professional! :) 




 Hello ExDrK;

Almost all jobs have a 30 day grace period in which either party can terminate the working relationship without notice.  Sometimes this is included in the offer letter, sometimes it's just a disclaimer form, sometimes it is in the Non-Disclosure agreement.  I would got to your HR representative (or call the phone number for the service they use) and ask.  Just be very apologetic and professional and nice.  The truth is that most employers don't really want employees who don't want to be there, it's more respectful to just come out with it.  

Hope this helps!  




 I guess my question would be why does she need to move 1000 miles away to study veterinary science?  You can literally do this anywhere!  I can understand that she might be in more demand in a large city, but that's neither here nor there until she's licensed.  Unless you're going to tell me she's planning to move in with a specific relative there, I would question if she isn't just looking for a way out of the relationship.  If it were me, I'd actually go along any way.  You only live once, and while all change can be scary, it is almost always worth it.  You could live in a new city, explore a new field, and if the relationship goes south, meet new people.  Worst comes to worst, move back.  The truth is that you're in charge of your own destiny.  Think about what would really make you happy and go for it!  




 Well, I'm guessing that you probably have folks on staff that could do similar work, if you need to know now, you could bring them the examples and ask them to guestimate how long they would take to build something similar from the ground up.  I'm sorry I'm not able to give you anything more concrete!  I'm sure you'll figure it out. :) 




 This isn't particularly scientific, but if it were me, I'd take the documents to their contributors in person and ask them to estimate how much time they put into them, conservatively.  Unless you have access to the original files, that's probably the best you'll be able to do.   




 Exit only, bro. 




 Hey, thank YOU for posting the awesome reference link.  I get really jazzed about this sale... I typically can't afford their eyes (in good conscience) until this happens, so I figured someone else might want to know. :) 




 Sorry to piggy-back, but that's another great thing about Amazon.  A lot of the albums you buy physical copies of come with a complimentary digital copy via auto-rip.  I love that I can order vinyl for my collection, but still have the convenience of "traveling copies" at no extra cost.  Before anyone asks, I'm not a paid rep for Amazon, I just really like it! 




 Thanks for the suggestion.  I'll check it out, maybe.  Have an upvote. :) 




 I think you're just being downvoted because he specified that he wasn't looking for iTunes in his question, but here, have an upvote on me. :) 




 Oh, no, don't worry about it man.  I can definitely see why you would think that. :) 




 I would imagine this would be a good combination... he probably gets you to experience things you wouldn't otherwise while not being such a Pollyanna that you'd get annoyed. :) 




 Two craziest things:

1) Someone had set up a glass of water with two perfect plastic REPLICAS of Beyer Asprin.  I've done some digging on the internet and still can't figure out why such a thing exists.  I have them in my jewelry box still almost ten years later.

2) We moved the credenza for spring cleaning and under it was a bag from the local sex shop.  It was full of those cheap dirty paperbacks and an un-opened package of huge anal beads.  




 There's a lot of hate for country music since people just think of Toby Keith or some other ignorant asshole.  There happens to be good country music out here.  I like Whiskeytown, Loretta Lynn, Neko Case, Shovels and Rope, the country Neil Young albums, Ryan Adams, I could go on...  




 I'm actually surprised at how much neutral there is... I can't really relate to this:
 
A neutral character does what seems to be a good idea. She doesn't feel strongly one way or the other when it comes to good vs. evil or law vs. chaos. Most neutral characters exhibit a lack of conviction or bias rather than a commitment to neutrality. Such a character thinks of good as better than evil-after all, she would rather have good neighbors and rulers than evil ones. Still, she's not personally committed to upholding good in any abstract or universal way.  




 Well, truthfully, he would never cheat.  I know that probably sounds like I'm taking him for granted, but, I mean, he never leaves the house and refuses to have anything to do with any person who isn't his immediate family.  Short of skipping work to have an affair (someone who loses 20+ hour a year in PTO because he refuses to take a day off, right), it would be ultra mega obvious.  

But we're playing pretend here.  If he did, I wouldn't really care much, but I would probably still leave.  




 So many stories about this guy, but one of the better ones what that we had a sheet of water running down into our living room (like two feet across, a literal sheet of water)... his explanation?  The water comes from Lake Superior, so it's extra cold... that water is condensation from the cold pipes and the warm air. 

Turned out to be the upstairs neighbor's bathtub overflow... she was just leaving the water on while she was in there.   




 Real Talk: I don't think cheating is a deal breaker, but if my husband cheated on me, I'd probably take it as a get out of jail free ticket and leave, never to re-marry.   




 I'm Chaotic - Good. :)

Edit: Description: A chaotic good character acts as his conscience directs him with little regard for what others expect of him. He makes his own way, but he's kind and benevolent. He believes in goodness and right but has little use for laws and regulations. He hates it when people try to intimidate others and tell them what to do. He follows his own moral compass, which, although good, may not agree with that of society.  




 This is pretty awesome if you're not sure: http://www.easydamus.com/alignment.html  




 In MMOs, I like to be altruistic.  If I see a newbie, I ask them if they have any questions or need anything.  I like community in an MMO and eventually that little player you helped gets really good. :)

On Facebook, I think it's best to only use it as a virtual photo album for your long-distance family.  I tend to try to only post supportive things and photos for people who can't be close enough to see my family in person.

LinkedIn is something I only recommend you use if you have impressive networking contacts.  It's rather pointless if you don't.

My tactics on Reddit is mostly to just be nice.  It's worked out pretty well, everyone seems a lot nicer than I thought they would be going in. :)

Hope this helps! 




 Here you go, folks: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vvijiNjplLs/Uj26mtv3_sI/AAAAAAAACNA/n3gxV5xgj_s/s1600/harry-potter-chart.jpg

I'm actually an INFJ, so this isn't really a question to me, but, hell, three out of four is pretty good, I think... I don't really have an easy time doing social networking.  I have to talk myself into calling strangers.  The best advice I can give you is to keep your arms uncrossed, have a pleasant look on your face, if you're in a group, invite loners in, think of a few questions that you wouldn't mind being asked yourself and ask them.  This is pretty specific to how to network in a large group, so if you're looking for something else, just hit me with a reply and I'll help. :) 




 Well, I think your question goes to show that you actually think you should pay for the music you listen to, and good for you.  The average musician actually makes less than $50k a year.  I get my MP3s from Amazon.  Unlike iTunes, it's an actual MP3 file if you choose to download it.  You still have cloud storage and can get applications for both iOS and Droid.  You can even listen on your work computer from the website without downloading anything.  Hope this helps!  




 I think it depends on what kind of person your parent is.  My own mother is one of those people who is convinced that the way she thinks is the only way to think (not just with me, but with her husband... the phrase she uses is "yes, but they're wrong!"), as a consequence, she's a very poor listener.  I can tell her things flat out and she's trying so hard to hear things she can relate to, she never remembers a thing!  

I would imagine if your parent were one of those people who is constantly seeking a different point of view or who is curious about the world at large would have observed a million and six things about you without your noticing.  ;) 




 I think the biggest thing I'm dealing with right now is recognizing what people mean when they say "marriage is hard."  Like, I heard that and assumed it would be obvious, like you will argue and you need to make up or compromise or whatever.  I had no idea what was meant was that you're probably going to wonder all the time if the negative things are "normal."  

My husband doesn't really like to engage in conversations or discussions, he doesn't like to do things or travel, and he has a very low sex drive.  For a jag there I was thinking "Is this what a neglectful marriage is?  Should I leave?"  But I'm starting to recognize that what I make of my life is still my own responsibility.  I've abandoned waiting for his participation to do things that I want to do, I've started going out for drives and seeing things of visual interest, watching movies alone, going out to eat, volunteering, basically doing the things I seemed to think for some reason were off limits since he didn't want to do them.  It's not like he told me I can't, so only my own pre-conceived notion of what marriage is stopped me from doing these things.

I am starting to recognize what ha925 mentioned in their comment: Being able to control yourself during the downtimes.  Recognizing that there is a middle ground between all or nothing.  But I also agree with not-quite-obscure in a moderate way.  I don't think I'd ever do this again.  It seems to be a bit unnatural a lot of the time.   




 Ahahaha, my former boss joked with my husband about arranging a marriage between our babies (his son is two months old, my daughter is 7 months), he told me my husband's eyes went totally flat and he said 100% seriously "I don't think she's ever going to date."   




 Also true... a kid is like an automatic extra $3000 back on your taxes... of course, that doesn't really approach what you're spending on them, but you know.... Surprise you have $3000 is nice for paying back your co-pay for the delivery or getting a new roof on your house.  Thanks, Uncle Sam!  




 This is so true... my best friend had warned me that this would happen, and I was like "whatever, I'm going to watch a Serbian Film now," but I was so wrong.  I can't read or watch anything involving abuse to children!  I can't even read the damn newspaper!  Why did I never notice how much infanticide is in the newspaper before?!  




 I wholeheartedly relate to your first point... I don't think I've gone to the bathroom when I've wanted to or eaten a hot meal at an actual table in 6 months!  However, you don't even hesitate, this is what you do now.  You learn to love the cold coffee.  Ha ha. 

The second was longer in coming for me, it actually only hit me about a month ago.  I think it's because she has a personality now.   




 We never argue and here's why: My husband doesn't ever engage.  I'll say I feel x, y, and z, and this is why.  He'll stare at me.  Sometimes an hour later he'll come back and apologize for "being an asshole," or not knowing I felt that way.  That's how it works.  Very dramatic, huh?

Edit: Sorry, I ignored part II of the question.  My big points of contention are basically that he doesn't hear me.  How many times do I have to tell you that I can't stand not being able to see a damn thing in the house, but I still come home to find you swapped all the lightbulbs for colored ones that don't light anything?  Or why is it that when I'm trapped in the car with you we have to listen to Pig Destroyer three turns too loud and when I ask you to turn it down, you ignore me?  I know women get a bad rap for expecting men to read their minds, but I tell him what I want all the time, and it basically only guarantees that I won't get it.  It's exhausting.  




 Initially, there is no autonomy.  I know as a mother, my immediate feeling when I came home was that no one could swoop in and save me, this creature needed ME to feed her and no matter how tired or sore or scared or anything I was, it was too bad, here we are!  That was an odd feeling, I've never felt it before or since.  




 I recommend that you just start doing small things by yourself that give you room to breathe.  I volunteer with a hospice on the weekend, and my assignments require me to drive for an hour both ways to see my ladies.  This time by myself in the car with music I like to listen to greatly quells my wanderlust.  

A lot of the things that you've mentioned aren't really things that you can simply go out and do without there being some damage, but you know, I said to my husband (who is a major homebody and allergic to spending money) that I wanted to travel when our daughter was older.  I told him that I would love for him to come, but that if he didn't, I still needed to go.  I think a lot of young people go into marriage thinking that it means you'll do things together all the time, but the truth is that you might not ever do a thing if you wait for the other person to participate.  It's okay to do things alone! It makes you feel capable and smart and free.   




 Sorry for being redundant in the way this is worded, but how has being married changed what you thought marriage would be like as a single person? 




 I legit think it would be like the movie series the Purge.  It was be wayyy fucked up.   




 Pig Faced Women!  Specifically that there was a rich philanthropist who was believed to BE ONE and she couldn't even dispel it by making public appearances... It had to be an actress that she hired since we actually believe she has the head of a pig.... Also getting bears drunk, shaving their faces, putting them in dresses and then claiming they are pig-faced women in your freak show?  Is this all made up?  What on earth! 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcAj3lOyv3s 

I had no idea that this was actually a THING, I thought this commercial was SATIRE.  Thanks for making it funny!  




 I feel a sense of community.  I like that I can give my opinion on things and not have it dis-counted because of the way I look... no one knows how I look!  I'm less lonely, I laugh more, and I think about things I might never have considered before.  I love reddit!   




 Mostly trivia in very specific areas.  I don't even know any Warren Zevon fans in real life but if I do I'll be able to regale them with all kinds of chestnuts!  Or what about the birth order and sun signs of the entire Culkin family?  Do you want to know everything I know about the North American Bison.  Sit down, sir.  I'll help you with that.... Now serial killer trivia, I use that SOMETIMES.  Like twice a year.  On Reddit.  




 People whistling.  In all seriousness, I don't even whistle to myself when I'm alone.  That's how disgusting I find it to be.  It literally gives me a facial twitch.  




 I occasionally reply with "Who is this?" to texts I receive when I know damn well who it is.  




 I can actually count on one hand the moments I've been passive aggressive, and so they're both pretty good stories.

1. At my first job there was this girl who would never switch shifts with anyone EVER.  But she would go to the owner and have get the boss to make her the closer when she wanted extra money.  When she would steal this shift from me while I was actively working it, I would pour sweet and sour sauce on the tile floor, knowing she had to mop it and it was a bitch.

2. My old apartment had a HUGE window on one wall.  The neighbor would leave the porch light on all night, so I couldn't sleep well as it was bright, and my dogs would bark at things moving in the driveway.  I asked my husband to turn it off after an hour, but he didn't want to offend the neighbor.  One day when the light had been on all night and all of that day, I went out with a broom and very lightly tapped the lightbulb, breaking the filament in it, so it appeared to have burned out from being on all the time.  The damn thing was nine feet up, so it wasn't like they were going to change it.  Ahahaha!   




 I'd be living very differently.  I'd get a motorcycle and go to Sturgis and live in a new city every few years and I'd be out camping by myself all the time.   




 This is pretty geeky, but whatever.... I wore a sweater I had knitted to work and someone stopped me and said she "Would buy something like that.... no really!"  It was like.... I spent about $100 on this hand painted yarn, and it took several hundred hours to make and you're condescending to tell me you would buy something like it, no really?  Go away.  




 Oh dear, he missed his reflex check to catch it in time. :( 




 Where were you when I was a kid? :)  I like your reddit contributions, technobarry.  You're a cool cat.  




 Shut up!  Really?  I had no idea.... that's really weird to think about.... 80 year old octopuses.... I'm going to have to Google this. :) 




 I would watch the fuck out of Steve Buscemi's! :) 




 What if it's in octopus years?  (Yes, I just thought you were that funny on that other thread....I'm still crying from laughter.) 




 I just got my pre-ordered copy... it's actually pressed in Germany apparently.  




 This isn't about me and my child, but I have one of my mom's:

In 1992, my mom was married to a construction worker.  He took her with on an out of town job.  The hotel had a fabulous pool, and my mom really wanted to go swimming.  She didn't have a swimsuit.  Her husband said he would buy her one if she'd have sex with him that night.  She stipulated that she wanted tequila too if that's what needed to be done.  This is the night she conceived my youngest sister.  My sister was the consequence of a sex barter for a swimsuit.  I'm never to tell her on penalty of death.  




 I'm the assistant to a lady-CEO! :)  




 It sounds like you have anxiety.  Hey! Me too!  But I'm conventionally very successful, I have a house and a beautiful baby and a husband and a respectable career where I make more than the average American (and much more than the average woman).  

This has helped me some of the time, and when it doesn't initially, it does after I've had time to process further: From "How to Stop Worrying and Start Living" 1. Imagine the worst possible outcome of the issue at hand. 2. Accept that it could happen. 3. Think of ways to make the best of that worst possible outcome. 

As my former boss liked to say, don't get crushed by the rock, break the rock into smaller pieces and deal with them as you can. :) 




 State of the Union Address Given : Most hilarious jokes in the world made. 

Body: Lots of analytical text that boils down to how when you get beyond the hilarious jokes mixed in, the President just over analyzed several creative possible actions before dissolving into a tangent about how they are conscious this isn't helping.  Compassion and exasperation ensue.   




 Well, when I was four, my mom asked me what I wanted to be went I grew up.  I told her I wanted to be an artist.  She said "Artists don't get paid anything until they're dead."  So I kept my eyes open.  At five, I went to my first funeral and met a friendly mortician.  I wanted to be a mortician until I was, like, 14.  You can see I had a fucked sense of humor even then.  

I'm not a mortician, but I have succeeded in making something to the tune of $200 in my lifetime for art.  Look out!   




 I really, really hope that your retirement is magical.  That you do all those things you wanted to but never had the time or felt guilty doing.  (100% sincere) 




 It's misplaced, but it's well-meaning.  

I actually just had a moment of clarity thinking about this.  My mom and I were talking and she casually mentioned that my sister has just decided not to go in and get her prescription renewed for her birth control.  I was beyond dismayed.  She's 23, living in a rented house with a roommate, broke, and getting married in two months.  I want to tell her that she has her whole damn life to raise babies... that she should enjoy her husband and travel and live a reckless life before committing to a baby (I have a 6 month old with my husband, so I'm projecting.).  My mother pointed out to me that my sister was much better set up than she herself was when she had her first child (me).  And in thinking about it, my mom was homeless and my father was an abusive drug addict.  No one would advise pregnancy under those circumstances... but here I am, married, a homeowner, with a career, making more than the average American, and a mother to a beautiful baby... hell, I even have rescue dogs and volunteer with a hospice.... What am I worried about?    




 Actually, this brings up a great one for me: People always tell you that marriage is hard work.  I always imagined they meant that you will fight (and, hey, no problem! I can handle that) but the truth is probably a lot more subtle than that.  Sometimes you feel invisible and taken for granted.  You didn't enter into a partnership in which you will do everything together... you might have married someone who will never want to take that trip or whatever... you need to move beyond what you thought your life would be like.  This has been something of a rough, and altogether different type of hard than I was imagining when I heard about it. 




 Why exactly am I reacting this way?  It's important when you have anxiety to screen any knee jerk reactions to things for irrationality.  So if I'm putting off making a phone call to a stranger to get catering for an event, I need to recognize that's what I'm doing and talk myself into fixing it. 

It used to be "What have I done for my marriage today?"  




 Just rapping on some theory here: I think the only reason you would cheat emotionally would be because, right or wrong, you feel lonely or disconnected with the people in your life.  It's a human impulse to want to be understood and valued.  Unless you're just curious.  I could see that too. 




 Assimilation of Native Americans and Internment of Japanese-Americans. 




 Passive aggression.  Or expecting me to read your mind... we are adults, you use your words!!!!  




 Yes, some variation on this: Older = Smarter.  This is pure ego on my part, but I feel so cheated when I see through people who should, for all intents and purposes, be better than everyone else, but aren't.  Like when my former boss, the CEO of his third company, tried to manipulate me by relating that we both grew up poor and refused to be victims.... Like, I wanted him to be able to manipulate me without my knowing that was what he was doing... He was all parlor tricks!  Where is the magic!?  

I cried for a whole week straight when I started at a call center and realized that there were 50 year olds whose actual aspirations were to continue working their entry level jobs at $8.50/hr and pick on younger people.  Like, no!  Why did you stop growing at 14?! Why did you do that?  Be better!  




 Right, unless there is more to this scenario, it's perfectly responsible to have a life insurance plan.  I'm guessing that since you're going to grad school, you've already got a huge amount of debt.  If Canada is like the US in that regard, your parents could be saddled with that debt if, heaven forbid, anything should happen to you.  I have taken out term life insurance on my husband (in addition to the insurance I have on myself) because we have a mortgage and an infant child.  If anything happened to either of us, I wouldn't want my child to lose her home as well as a parent.  Life insurance is just good planning. :) 




 Quite right, we always make time for the things that are truly important to us.  I sometimes think that I should feel guilty for working full time and then volunteering for six hours at a hospice one day of the weekend, but then I have to remind myself that what I'm doing is making my headspace better so that when I'm with my daughter, I'm the best I can be.  




 Unfortunately, I don't think it will, you see he had to have a six month probationary period where he had to drive with another licensed driver, but he's married to one... So it wasn't an issue. Initially learning is going to be the tricky part, but I'm sure you could use online videos for the theory of it... Do you think you could maybe offer carpooling? Then in theory, a licensed driver would come to your house, and you would drive the two of you to a location like a school or shop? Or maybe you could look into community education? I took what we call "Behind the wheels" with an instructor that I paid.  




 Can you tell us what state you live in?  The laws and guidelines vary greatly from state to state.  If not, just say so and I can still help by relaying how my husband got his license at 38. :) 




 Please, don't take this as nay-saying, but I'd feel guilty if I didn't mention that in the time I was using the Nuvaring, I suffered recurrent yeast infections.  This is not uncommon (14% of women experience it as a side effect according to Google).  I never had this problem prior to the Nuvaring, and I was on it at age 24.  I didn't ever have trouble with it coming out on accident, like the other posters, I took it out during intercourse... it was uncomfortable to leave in during. 




 Nobody has recommended boric acid yet.  Please Google it before writing it off; this has been immensely helpful to me.  I started getting recurrent infections after using the Nuvaring, even after I switched birth control methods.  A yeast infection has an 80% chance of recurrence, so using anti-biotics is really just a risky band-aid that comes with a hefty medical bill after.  I got 00 size gel caps off of Amazon and a bottle of powdered boric acid.  If I have an infection, I insert two capsules a day (one in the morning, one at night) vaginally.  If you choose to do this, you'll want to use a panty liner.  I also do just a half gel cap after my period or after intercourse just to be safe.  I also use an oral probiotic: Acidophilus.  I get that at Wal-Greens.  I hope things get better for you!     




 Hmmm. You just described the first feature of "Family Portraits: A Trilogy of America." 









 This has helped me some of the time, and when it doesn't initially, it does after I've had time to process further: From "How to Stop Worrying and Start Living" 1. Imagine the worst possible outcome of the issue at hand.  2. Accept that it could happen.  3. Think of ways to make the best of that worst possible outcome.  

After the sheer hell that was my failure at breastfeeding followed by months of exclusive pumping that lead to three bouts of mastitis and finally Reynauld's syndrome of the nipples, I had to accept that I was going to have to give up.  This process, writing down that I would have more time with my family, get more sleep, feel less pain, focus more on my baby, be happier, etc, helped me move beyond what seemed at first a crushing failure.  This is a major example of when I used this, but as a person who struggles with anxiety about pretty much everything, you can use it to keep things in perspective.  

People with anxiety tend to be pretty capable when they know what is coming so thinking "If the meter runs out and I get a ticket, I know I can map the way to court house and that I can afford the ticket.  It will be annoying, but it is not the end of the world," can make a big difference. 

Good luck... in reading through your Reddit contributions, you seem like a warm, funny, and intelligent lady.  I'm sure you'll figure things out.  I believe in you!  




 The fact that you down voted only the reply where I wrongly accused you of being obtuse makes me love you a little bit.  I'm sorry. (I'm being 100% sincere.) 




 Because I also work in a field where I'm stuck using a stupid style guide and it's updated all the time.  I do think you're being a bit obtuse here, my point still stands, and in fact, you're making it very more to the point... none of it is consistent or organic!   




 I'm sure they've since been updated.  "Iris" isn't plural, but "Adams" is! 




 I didn't go, just because I'd gone in 11th grade, so what was the point?  This along with my decision to not go to the all-night grad party or the graduation dinner or the Sno-Ball my senior year are things I regret on a moderate level now.  The truth is that the business of being young is incredibly fleeting, and you never get to go back and do those things again.  Even if they are terrible, they make for even better stories years later.  I spent a lot of my teenage years trying to be a little adult, and that is sad because I'll be an adult for the rest of my life.... you can only be young and do these things now.   




 The rules are not consistent.  "Mary's" is possessive, "Iris's" is correct, but "Iris'" isn't, even though "the cars'" would be if you mean more than one car that possesses something... meanwhile "it's" can only be "it is," with "its" being possessive, being at odds with everything I just wrote out for you above.  It is any wonder at all that people get confused?     




 You know what I love about this question?  It assumes that people don't have a 'type,' that they don't act like John Wayne Gacy and only pick victims that are tall, thin, and have shaggy blond hair.  




 Lack of "whole foods" meaning food that hasn't been chemically modified or otherwise messed with.  Putting a damn window in a chicken coop doesn't make the chickens in it "free range."  There is a reason why we have so many dietary issues in the US.  30+ flavors of pop tarts doesn't help. 




 I liked the graphic novel "Black Hole" by Charles Burns.  




 And even the reason we have the right to bear arms! 




 Every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back I hope you feel it. 




 This is what I'm talking about!!!! THAT IS IRONIC.  It's ironic!  Why, why would you assume there would be a non-smoking rule in the smoking room?  That is the opposite of what you would expect!  




 How about things we have to see often:

"Just in case you thought Memorial Day was about barbecues" - Oh yeah, I totally have met that person who talks about today as national hotdog day.  That's a thing that happens! /sarcasm

"Why don't we have White History Month?" - I'm sorry, what do you think we're studying the other 11 months of the year?

"It's time we stopped apologizing for being American." - The person going door to door in Iowa demanding you drag our great nation through the mud has failed to come to my house.

"Like if you support drug testing for food stamps" - Guess what! Drug dealers don't typically accept food stamps for drugs, but you know who does take food stamps? Grocery stores. You can use the food stamps to feed the children who didn't ask to be born to the drug addicts.  You know, the ones whose food money was spent on drugs. 




 You know, I thought the big dissension about this song was very presumptuous.  The argument that things were "unfortunate" instead of "ironic" assumes that she didn't expect an opposite outcome.  I don't think it's a stretch to assume your wedding day would be perfect, or that on a single plane ride, you would be safe.  Am I crazy? 




 Just follow their sentence that ended in "sir" with a soft, non-aggressive "ma'am."  You know, correct them in a quiet sort of way.  Unless they're totally not listening, they'll apologize profusely.  I've got a bit of experience with this having done phone work. I hope this helps you. :) 




 Respond in a nearly inaudible voice so that if they want to hear what you have to say, they have to pipe the fuck down. ;)

I'd make it a rule not to acknowledge behavior you don't appreciate.  




 "Lucky Now" by Ryan Adams.  Why did he choose to not repeat the chorus after the last verse?  I love that song, but at 2 minutes and 30 odd seconds, you can't put it on repeat. :) 




 It is a word that can be applied to denote a situation that has opposite outcome of what one would expect.  




 I think, and please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you read my response as the fear being my own.  It is not.  One thing I'm learning is that people are conscious of their own memory loss and disconcerted by it.  I don't fear my own death or degenerative brain disorder.  I'm acting to try to alleviate the pressure these patients feel to remember things.  They don't really need to bother.  It's irrelevant.    




 Cinnamon Rolls and Chili! :) 
























 Well, I'm not bald, but my husband is.  

When I was 20 weeks pregnant, we got one of those 3-D ultrasound photos of our unborn daughter.  She already very clearly had my husband's nose.  When I would show it to people, I would say proudly "She already looks just like her daddy," and more than one person, totally serious mind you, would say "Oh, because she's bald?"

Guys.  Come on.  He shaves his head.  It's not a genetic trait.  She came out with a Mohawk, incase you were curious.  




 I collect a certain set of Christmas tree ornaments.  I also keep track of a bunch of silly little details on them (release year, amount paid, place procured, release number, etc) in an Excel spreadsheet.  I mentioned this spreadsheet in a job interview.  Obviously I was just about laughed out of the room, but they still offered me the job.  Even at six months pregnant. 




 That Tiefling they make you party with in Neverwinter Nights 2.  I can't remember her stupid name.   




 A lot of court issued documents are public property and some states have begun putting them on the internet.  If you know someone's name and date of birth, you can find things that can potentially lead you to other things.  I had the most luck with tracking down things like divorce papers and death certificates to give me locations that I then used to check archived obituaries for.  Obits list survivors.  You can look up these survivors' phone number and get leads.  




 Aww, thank you Sunshiny Cloud!  I'm glad things got better for you!  You're a very kind person, your kids are lucky to have you. :)   




 "it will take about two years to get back on track"

I'm so grateful to you I have tears in my eyes.  Thank you so much.  Really.  Thank you.  




 No, not yet.  My OB decided to do a pap at my two month post-natal appointment, so my insurance doesn't cover another well-woman until 2016.  I didn't even think about it at the time!  Do you think it's serious enough that I should just pony up out of pocket?  (I've got high deductible insurance.) Thank you for the response. :) 




 Hello,

My daughter is now seven months old, but I'm still dealing with a lot of the physical symptoms from my pregnancy. The most annoying one is the carpal tunnel. I've lost all my baby weight, why are my arms and hands still hurting? Will they never go back to normal? 

I'm also struggling with "baby-brain" before I would make mistakes like having to say "wanting to help because we're all people" instead of "compassion," which makes sense, but these days, I go to type "beautiful" and end up typing "people!" What gives?!

I've also still go a lot of pain down there. I gave birth naturally and it took them an hour to stitch me back up. I've healed, obviously, but the scar tissue hurts during intercourse... will it ever go away?

This is TMI (like most of the things in this post, sorry!) but what about hemorrhoids? I'm never constipated, but they just won't go away.

Ladies, does it get better or do we just sort of forget what it was like before and move on?

Thank you for your time and responses. :) 
 




 http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1367997005/733/8648733.jpg I got you a link!  




 It's Georgie!  I'm a girl. Ahahaha.  




 To be 100% honest, it's not their concern.  If they were a better fit, they would be doing it.  If they're just criticizing with no aspirations, then the manager should consider it to be noise so long as they accept that valid points may be made that contribute to personal or professional betterment.  But the truth is that a lot of times subordinates are just bored and looking for things to get upset with.  If someone has a legitimate concern, to reiterate what I said, they need to bring it to their manager.  If the manager fails to act, go above them.  It's on that next tier to decide who is qualified and who is not.  




 Maybe I clicked through your username.... maybe I did.  It's okay, though, all I did was upvote some of your more inane comments.  I consent to a similar stalking act if you feel so inclined. ;)

Sorry that board harshed your mellow, man.  




 Did you die tho?

Just kidding.  I'm loving your contributions.  The Double Double one made me spit out my soda at my desk. XD 




 Two Times:

1) You've been very explicit about your issues, but they are blowing you off.

2) It's an issue of a sensitive subject (e.g. sexual in nature) that involves them.  




 Lost in Translation.  Pretty much every scene he filmed for the whiskey commercial was priceless.  When he acted in slow motion, his goofy impression of Roger Moore, all of it.  So silly.   




 Let me start by saying that you're doing a great job.  These first few weeks are one of the strangest times of your life and you're expected to handle them on little or no sleep with a broken and recovering body.  You're so strong and you're doing such a good job.

Now let's talk about this sleep thing.  You have some valid complaints here, but you seem like a very practical and reasonable person who knows that some times you just have to let things slide.  I want you to examine why you're upset when you get upset.  Do you feel that a specific remark is insinuating that you're not working hard enough?  That you're not competent in his eyes?  It's good to understand why we feel what we feel because understanding allows us the chance to recognize when we are overreacting or being unreasonable.  This has nothing to do with you, personally, it's just human nature!  The thing is that a lack of sleep make a mountain out of a molehill.  We're more irritable and we don't feel well, that makes things seem worse.  I love that you said you don't get frustrated with your baby, but the truth is that frustration is normal, you might be putting it somewhere else, wrong or right.  Don't feel bad about it, just think about it.

Now the most important thing here is to communicate.  If he is making you feel like he thinks you are a bad mother, you should say so in a way that is matter-of-fact and as unemotional as possible.  A lot of times people just don't realize that what they're saying is hurting us.  I want you to think about something.  How often in your life have you said something with the specific intention of hurting another person?  Probably never, right?  Other people are usually no different.  If he is hurting you, he's probably not doing it intentionally, but he still needs to know how he's making you feel. 

His overreaction to the baby's perceived health problems is borne out of love, I think you know that because you are very observant.  If he's that enamored of your little man, you might just be able to convince him to go show him off.  My area hospital has pre-natal classes that are just for fathers.  These classes pair up with the new-father support group and their babies.  Daddy might just need some time with other guys who are going through the same thing, validate those feelings, and then relax.  I know we want to be all things for our partners, but sometimes we relate best to members of our own sex, you know?

This little stuff you're talking about that bothers you, it's time to employ pragmatism.  If he is questioning how you are doing something, in a nice, calm, non-emotional way, explain exactly why you are doing it.  If he suggests a different way, ask him to explain (nicely, don't confront) why he thinks that way is the best, to explain it.  If he is a man with a plan or someone who likes to know how things work, this might just short-circuit a heated situation.  

I'm sorry that you're having trouble and feeling lousy, but I'm SO PROUD of you for asking for help.  Not only just asking, but you clearly want to do what is best.  You're going to be a wonderful, wonderful example to your little person.  You're rational, caring, have a good perspective, question things that should be questioned, and most of all, you want the very best for everyone involved.  When you come from that place, you're the very best kind of caretaker.      




 Wow, now you're swearing at me.  I've been nothing but civil to you.  I apologize in advance for how angry this is probably going to make you, because it is never my intention to make someone feel bad, but I am choosing not to give a moment more of my energy.  Take care.   




 1) I was going to reassure you that attire is a lot less strict these days, but man, if it's Baptist and a small town in Texas, you should probably ask someone you know for clothes to borrow or buy something. It's a lot more normal than you might think to borrow funeral attire.  Lots of people don't have anything to wear to a funeral.

2) There are two parts that happen when a person passes away.  The visitation and the actual funeral.  The visitation is the viewing of the body.  It's usually in the funeral home itself, although in old fashioned places, it can be at a family home.  There are usually prayers recited to the group and then people go up and talk about the deceased.  It's a low pressure deal.  The funeral itself is where you go to the grave site and bury the person if that is what's happening.  Typically a man of the church will be there to say a prayer, but, again, it's not a high pressure thing you participate in.  You just stand there with your head down.

3) Totally not tacky.  I'm sure your family would love to see them.  I'd add a nostalgic little blurb about what a good memory it was if you're so inclined.  




 I'm glad I could help.  Thank you for thanking me!  It made me feel accomplished. :) 




 What I did was to put Former before their job title and company, so the reviewer would understand the connection.  If they want to know about current situation, they can ask when they call.  I formatted my line items like this:

*First Name Last Name* / Former *job title here* - *former company name* / Relationship to me (e.g. Past Direct Supervisor) / *Phone number with area code* 




 I simply don't like exercises in futility. I have rationale, but why do you deserve to know what it is?  I don't owe you an explanation.  I know in my heart that I don't believe a single thing you've accused me of thinking about men.  You can't convince me that I do.  I likely can't convince you that I don't.  So what's the point?  I kind of doubt that you have one. 

As an aside, if you really want my attention, you don't have to be a bully to get it.    




 As a companion to my response to your other question, I'd still rather be short.  I can get into spaces most people can't, I'm more resourceful, I occasionally get out of doing things I don't really want to do, I look adorable at my height, while at 5'3" I would probably be nothing remarkable.  

And I would totally date a boy who was short.  I happen to be married to someone who is 6'1.5" but let me tell you, it's pretty much just awkward in every way.  Our wedding pictures are hilarious.  My biggest (ho ho) crushes are right around 5'5". 

Edit: Although thinking about it further, I'm pretty devil may care... being 6'2" as a woman would be pretty cool insofar as it fits my personality.  I think if I were very tall, I'd be braver.  I'd still date shorter men though.  Long hair, don't care. 
 




 I'm not quite five feet tall. 

People take this as a license to rest their forearms on my shoulder as a joke.  They say things like "How's the weather down there?" which they think is funny and original but is not.  They ask me stupid things like if I'm turned away at amusement parks (no, dumbass, I'm not 4'5") and how I put pillowcases on pillows.  

The night I got married, I went out for supper with my husband, his step sister, and her husband.  I was 24, the hostess was 19 at the very most.  She said "So three adults and one child?"  Another time, while I was visibly pregnant, and 27, I went out to dinner with the CEO of my then company to a place called "Shula's."  Like Don Shula.  They brought me a menu that was printed on a regulation sized football.  My boss got a paper menu.  Yes, at six months pregnant, they STILL thought I needed a kids menu.  I am almost 30.  I have crows feet.  Are you even paying attention!?   




 What would be an acceptable answer to you? 




 I recalibrated the counterweight and set it according to your directive about the anti-skate matching the counterweight setting. I'm still having the same trouble. It is very intermittent. Like the same distance into multiple records, but not a constant issue, track three is bad, track five is terrible, track four sounds fine.... I might just need to bring it in for repairs. I'm out of my depth.  




 I'm not actually certain that the counterweight is right... it was already installed on my unit.  I'll try taking it off and putting it back on according to the instructions to be sure.  Thank you for the help.  I would have assumed that the settings on it were accurate rather than that the part might be on wrong so the settings mean nothing.  




 Can you give us any more background?  Is his mother in pain?  Is he not getting enough to eat?  Is he not interested?  Is he detaching?  What exactly seems to be the trouble here?  




 I'm not sure if you're actually asking me or just making a point, but to err on the side of optimism, no, it told me to set the counterweight at 2.  

I've looked up anti-skate and what I'm getting is that everyone has an opinion on it and I probably need some sort of test record to set it? 




 What exactly are you looking for here?  




 What is anti-skate?  Like I know where the setting is, but what does it do?  What should I be listening for it to change?  I have a 0 - 3 for that one.  My manual doesn't explain what it does, it just tells me to set it at 0.  




 How often do you ever say anything with the explicit intention of hurting someone's feelings?  I bet it's almost never if not never period.  The truth is that even the most hurtful people we have to deal with on a daily basis rarely intend to hurt us, they're just not cognizant of how they really come across.  If you feel attacked, take a moment to think if there is any possible positive place that the comment could come from.  If you can't think of any, just say in a curious, open kind of voice "I'm not sure what you mean, can you elaborate?"  If they really are being an asshole, at that point they'll get all red and sputtery and you'll come out on top.  I doubt that scenario will play out, though.  People are seriously about 10x more harmless than we can ever imagine.  




 I went ahead and did it three separate times just in case I was accidentally twisting it somehow... it's still too slow.  Could it be the pressure setting?  




 No, it's definitely the player.... My brand new Neil Young album played fine on my last set-up and it's all distorted and slow on this one, just the same as the other record, which was also brand new. :-/ 




 The third track is too slow, I'm sorry, I should have specified.  I haven't tried a different record... I'll go do that now and report directly back!  




 Hello, thanks for the fast response!  I just went in and tried it and it is the same. 




 Hello /r/vinyl ;
I got my second-hand Teac TN-300 in the mail today.  I don't have any experience with turntables, but I think the belt needs to be replaced on this one.  The first track on the record sounds fine, but when I get to the second it's intermittently the wrong speed, and the third is unlistenable... I've tried Google and looking through the Amazon reviews and the Teac website but I can't find any information on replacement parts....

Can someone tell me what kind of belt and stylus I should get for this turntable?  

I apologize in advance if these are ridiculous questions. I'm really lost! 




 Here you go, friend: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice#Ice_harvesting :) 




 While I think responding to you will probably only encourage this type of behavior, I'll take the time to point out that it was by merit of my action, a forward suggestion to contact a stranger about personal issues, that prompted my comment.  It was meant as a reassurance.  It wasn't meant as a condemnation of men in general, but a recommendation on why I might be able to help.  I'm very sorry that you took offense to my remark to the point that you needed to go to the trouble of making an account just to catch me out, but you only need go through my comment history to see that I'm interested in helping other human beings.  I'm not a man-hater.  Hopefully this susses things and you move along back to your main account.  




 I'm actually really flattered someone cares so much about me that they made an account just to send me weird replies from though.... Oh reddit, you magical place, you. :)  




 I'm not sure why this is a reply to me, man. I don't believe that at all!  




 It's nice man!  I like the leaves and the yard too!  And the color of your t-shirt is a great color with everything else.  Nice picture. :) 




 This is interesting to me.  My husband once told me that he never suggests any solutions to my problems because he simply assumes that anything he could come up with would be something I already thought of myself.  He's rather missing the point (which I've told him)... it's the act of making an effort that matters, not the outcome.  It's the same with this, the act of trusting someone enough to tell them what you really feel.  From your response, you're either someone with anxiety (like me) or you're with someone who isn't good to you.  In either case, I'm sorry that things aren't easier for you, and I hope they get better some day.  




 I think that it is infinitely more responsible than protesting abortion by carrying giant photos of aborted fetuses in public where children can see them and be scarred for life.  Too much?

I'm big on freedom of speech.  I'm big on my country.  I'm also big on personal responsibility.  Yes, I understand that it is your right to protest with photos of gore.  But should you?  Does it not contradict your whole position?  

I LOVE America.  I'm SO PROUD to be an American.  Really.  While I will be the first one up and I will sing every damn word of the Star Spangled Banner, I will not recite the pledge of allegiance.  I find worship of an inanimate object to be fascist.  And I love that because I am an American, I can talk about this with you all.  I am only too aware that my freedom has come at a cost, and so not exercising those freedoms is a crime.

Since I'm on the soapbox, vote folks.  It's important.    




 PM me if you ever want to talk.  I promise I'm not a creepy old man.  Just a girl who is close to 30 and knows what it is like to be in a problematic marriage.  




 I'm sorry. :( 




 Okay, I think I've been waiting for almost 15 years to see someone ask about this so I can say:

All or Nothing.

I have seen All or Nothing.  It has no plot, you can't understand a single thing they're saying without the captions, it's depressing, and confusing.  But sometimes I see the preview again, and it is literally such a good trailer that I think to myself... Maybe I just didn't get it the first go round.  Maybe I should see it again.

 I have a friend who lives half the way down the world from me.  

He refuses to believe that we have "not for profit" banks here (meaning a credit union).

He also refuses to believe anything about the phenomenon of Ice Harvesting. 

I've proven both things, but as he says "I believe it, but it's bullshit." 




 I don't think it has anything to do with luck, except in the way one might say our souls are placed into specific bodies, but I actually don't believe in souls.  

I think childbirth is one of those things that hasn't really been researched in the way it should be.  For example, while doctors know what to give you to induce labor, they actually have no idea what it is in our bodies that sends us into it.  Why don't they know this yet? 




 Virtual Reality by RedRover... or anything by RedRover really.... but this one is about LadyDevimon tricking the girls from 02 Digimon into entering a virtual reality with their Digimon and forcing them into about ten odd combinations of sexual assault on her and each other.    




 Stop.  Are you being serious?!

Edit: I actually don't want to know. 




 Stuffed bell peppers are too much of a pain in the ass to make unless you're making a ton of them... I'd do that!  And I'd freeze the extras. :) 




 I've got a new theme song for you : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AhKO4NXJA4

Apparently it is not so weird of a phenom that it prevented Ryan Adams from singing about it on what is arguably one of the best country albums ever written.  




 Mac, c'mon, man.  What's that first word in my reply? 




 Typically in America no "whole food" is taxed, meaning ingredients such as vegetables or oatmeal or meat.  It's only prepared and processed things that are non-essential that are taxed, like soda, chips, and fast food. 




 I like to use it in conjunction with holiday weekends.  For instance in America, Christmas is on a Friday and New Years is the following Friday.  I'd take off M-R of New years week for sure... and I'd ask for it now.  You get ten days for the price of four!   




 Oh no, you misunderstood my question, but also gave me the answer.  I mean there, because you said Tampons were, pads were not, so what are cups?  Thanks for the info, this is useless trivia I'm sure I can entertain someone with.  :) 




 Seriously though, can you let me know if the Diva Cup is taxed?  Now I'm actually curious.  




 Listen, you can't hold back your diva power when you are a stripper.... so you use le Diva Cup.  This is 101 stuff.  Cancel the revolt!  Mort le Revolution!  




 Any question whatsoever I might post in /r/vinyl 

Talk about an intimidating group.  




 Here in America, prepared food is taxed (le Cheeseburger) but grocery items (le broccoli) are not.  Tampons are the fast food of feminine products.  Off-the-cuff-theory-Thursday! Hey!  




 Snowtown 




 I'm sorry you've upset yourself so much by thinking about this... it's pretty simple, so don't worry further: It's a human survival trait to recommend ourselves to others by mimicking their facial expressions.  They see us smile, they become conscious of their ability to manipulate their facial muscles (you can stick your tongue out and raise your eyebrows at a newborn, and they will mimic you, but it is subconscious), and then they smile to recommend themselves to you.  Smiling feels good because it releases endorphins.  So they keep doing it. :) 




 Kismet.  You stop that.  I'm looking at you, alternative rock band HURT.  




 My OLD apartment.  Funny thing.  The lightbulbs kept burning out there.... So we moved.  




 Yes, your first sentence is exactly what I'm saying. 




 Team Dakota Regular 4ever.  (Yes, I'm trolling, but in a fond sort of way that I hope is endearing rather than enraging.) 




 Because if you use your caps lock and italicize it, it looks like the distinctive handwritten font used in 1960's era comics.  We need this for our satire.  




 I feel very flattered by this and some what self conscious since I'm laughing alone in my office like a crazy person.   




 Honey, the very worst thing that can happen to you is that you say the words "You know what?  That's a great question.  I'm not sure about that, but I would like to ask my supervisor.  Would you mind holding?"

I've been on every level of a call center from agent to business development.  It really is that simple. 

Your anxiety is totally normal for anyone that is starting a new job.  You will learn, and because you're so concerned about doing a good job, you will probably become a shining example faster than you think.

Good luck!  I believe in you!  




 If I weren't married, we'd be getting married.  To each other.  




 This is actually pretty simple: Beer tastes good.  Good gin also tastes good.  People don't necessarily drink to get drunk. 

It is an easy thing to feel happy in an altered state.  The hard thing is to be happy when you're just yourself.  To be able to deal with things that are uncomfortable or boring or upsetting without reaching for some crutch. 




 Thank you for telling me how you feel.  I will endeavor to use more descriptors if you ever ask me how I am and it is my impulse to say "fine." 3 




 Okay, now I have to confess the one passive aggressive thing I did that I'm, like, super proud of, indulge me, okay?: 

My old apartment had a HUGE window on one wall. The neighbor would leave the porch light on all night, so I couldn't sleep well as it was bright, and my dogs would bark at things moving in the driveway. I asked my husband to turn it off after an hour, but he didn't want to offend the neighbor. One day when the light had been on all night and all of that day, I went out with a broom and very lightly tapped the lightbulb, breaking the filament in it, so it appeared to have burned out from being on all the time. The damn thing was nine feet up, so it wasn't like they were going to change it. Ahahaha!  




 I hate to break it to you, but some of us women (like me) operate in a typical male fashion where we just say what we mean when we feel like it.  And some men are insufferably passive aggressive.  We're rarely matched with two of the same kind. ;)

If I tell you I'm fine, I actually mean I'm in a neutral place between "really great" and "not so great."  I'm telling you the truth.   




 I have inane stories for all occasions, but here is one to humor you:

My mother planted a weeping maple in our yard.  As the name suggests, the leaves hang downward on it like it is weeping.  About four months passed with this tree in our yard, and my sister came in and said, 100% serious mind you, "Mom, I think your tree is sick."  I have about 10 more stories like this between my two sisters.  




 Giving birth.  They tell you the first time it'll be 20+ hours of labor and more painful than you can imagine and that you'll probably end up needing medical intervention at some point.

I was in labor for 11 hours, pushed for 45 minutes, no drugs.  They did spend an hour stitching me back up, but I was pretty much in shock at that point, so all I remember is how I wanted to put my legs down, so what is taking so long.  All in all, I was thinking it would be MUCH WORSE.  




 Do Canadians have birth certificates?  In America, we have our fathers' names on them, linking their government identifier to ours.  Also in America, we sometimes have to bring in a birth certificate as proof of our citizenship with other things.  This might be a way to get your hands on it... 

My situation isn't exactly like yours, but my father was never a part of my life, and then when I was 12, we got word that he had passed away.  When I was 21, I managed to get ahold of his ashes without having met or interacted with anyone on that side of the family myself.  I had his name and I dug into old obituaries.  The obits list survivors which gave me leads that led to other leads on who to find contact information for. 

Good luck!  




 "A personal point of pride for me is my discipline.  I am organized and manage my time well.  While I work well in a team, independently I can be counted upon to hold myself to a standard of excellence.  I know that I would be an asset to your company, and you only need speak with me in person to see how passionate I am."  




 Talk about their feelings.  Like I get that you don't tend to feel things about petty issues, but my goodness, you must feel some things some times.... why are you just waiting for me to be able to intuit what you're thinking?  It drives me crazy that there are probably things I need to work on but because we never talk about what annoys you or what hurts you, I'll never be able to examine and grow into a better partner.   




 I'm not sure... but there is actually a whole section on the Argentina Wikipedia page about whether Arggies are actually white.  It's very weird.  




 This was a lyrical miracle.  




 I am younger.  And about a foot shorter.  I mean, I'm pretty smart, but how would she know that?  It may be because I am the direct report of the CEO who is also her immediate supervisor, but c'mon... I'm just a secretary!  I'm hardly relevant!  




 I don't know how much of this is a pretty girl problem, since I suspect it is just a short, young girl problem, but when I worked at Gamestop, I would specifically ask guys if they had any questions, they would tell me no, and then immediately make a bee-line to my male co-workers and proceed to ask them things.  

More to the point of what you're talking about here, at my current job, I've incurred a bit of pointless one-sided rivalry with one of the top level ladies.  We're decently close in age.  She was asking co-workers I went to high school with ten years ago what they remembered about me.  She never allows me to do the simple things my predecessor did for her.  She refuses to make eye contact.  She also criticizes my snack choices at board meetings to her co-workers.  I have no idea why she cares about me.  She's got three degrees, I'm in a no-ladder position, and I'm pretty nice/helpful/competent.  I think some women just tend to struggle with the idea that building someone up doesn't detract from your own merit.  It's too bad.  Building people up feels so much better.   




 We just want to drink NOS and watch Tokyo Drift in peace.  




 This isn't a television commercial, but we have two super morbid radio ads up here in MN.  One is about boat safety and we get to hear someone drown while someone narrates what is happening in that person's body as they are drowning.  The other is about going through a windshield in a car accident and what exactly is damaged and how in your body.  Both pretty unnecessary.  To add stress to dismay, the car accident one also features sirens.  So you flinch and think you're being pulled over. :-/ 




 I love the original flavor of NOS.  They even have a great website where you can put in your location and they have distributor data that tells you WHAT FLAVORS the stores carry!  The Loaded Cherry flavor is pretty awesome too.  




 If you're comfortable, can you tell me what sort of job you're applying for?  What you've got here is painfully generic and not specific to any one type of work... here is an example of a similar paragraph I wrote for my sister when she was applying as a bank teller:

I am a very service minded individual who takes pride in being able to identify the needs of others and to make sure that they are taken care of.  I am energetic, outgoing, and positive.  I love being able to improve someones day and to make people laugh.  I feel that I would be a great addition to your organization.
 




 Well, you're looking at the difference here between making an open ended statement like "Sorry, I really don't want to intrude, it's just that I've been having trouble sleeping, would you mind keeping it down at 12am," which while perfectly reasonable could still backfire on you, and a statement where you're insinuating your roommate should live his life the way you want him to "Would you mind going out instead of being here after 12pm sometimes?"  

All criticism usually ends in defensiveness no matter how careful we are with people, it's just human nature.  To be more specific though, if her husband is still hanging about and they're getting a divorce, your roommate going over there could result in him being assaulted.... who needs that on their conscience....? Even if he didn't take your advice, he'd probably think you're a bit off suggesting it.  I'd be very scared to run into a soon-to-be ex husband as a man.

I hope this didn't come off as condescending.  I swear, I'm trying to help in good will. :)  




 About a month ago or a month ago?  Most employers have a 30 day grace period in which either party may terminate your employment contract at any time. :)

Of course, you need to be respectful and grateful and apologetic.  Life happens, but if you go above and beyond to make it clear that you are only doing what you feel you must and feel very guilty about it all, they will likely harbor no ill will.  




 If you've already decided that you don't really want to mention it, you can take the path of least resistance.  I have this at my house, and it works great, you just need to make sure you put it in a central location in the room... it doesn't overpower noise, it scatters it.  It just sounds like a box fan: http://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Easy-Sound-Conditioner-Machine/dp/B00GFSF402/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1432823103 sr=8-1 keywords=white+noise+machine 




 Well, like so many things, this isn't something that someone can do for you.... make you want to live.  You have to want it yourself.  

I'm a huge believer in choosing things.  Deciding in my head and heart that I'm going to do something and leave no room for an alternative.  Being stubborn and having high level anxiety (so a fear of failure in any form) pretty much guarantees that I'll follow through.

You've said that you can't allow yourself to die and that you feel guilty for even considering it because of your parents.  It sounds like to me that a pragmatist would have grounds to see the opportunity to make a choice here.

If you don't care about yourself then give yourself over to the betterment of things.  Yes, you could choose to die, but that's selfish and will probably only guarantee that your parents will divorce at the very least, or kill themselves at the very worst. (Source: http://lighthaiti.org/the-connection-between-divorce-and-death-of-a-child.html)  That's a negative on a negative and doesn't make sense.  Instead, you should make yourself work to better things, to make life beautiful for people who can enjoy it.  I recommend volunteering for a hospice.  Many people are dying and have no family to be there with them at the end.  They are scared and they are lonely.  Government regulation mandates that 5% of all hours in hospice come from unpaid companions.  Maybe you should look into it.  




 I've actually (what a coincidence!) got to go to bed myself.... so just in case you think I might be on to something, here is a Mayo Clinic link for you... don't worry, it's not a big deal, just a blood test and some cheap pills: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypothyroidism/basics/definition/con-20021179 




 I've got a book suggestion for you: "How to Stop Worrying and Start Living" by Dale Carnegie.  You need to learn how to live in day-tight compartments as Dale says.  Good luck!   




 Have you ever had your thyroid tested?  This isn't something the doctor will do unless they suspect there is a need.  If you haven't had one, and you can't afford to go right now, look in the mirror, thyroid issues will typically leave a physical clue on your neck... it will look like you have a slightly puffy collar... almost like you have a hair tied under your chin and another just above your collarbones.

 Madeline Albright!  Prague Winter was amazing!  :) 




 Could he possibly move on ahead of you?  Set things up so you can join him in a few months? 




 Have you ever invited this friend to do something in the city with you?  

You seem like a pragmatist; so I'm sure you know the answer here: Is this person someone you like enough to do stuff that's not your favorite with? If they are, compromise, say something like "Since you're always dragging me out into the woods, I figured this weekend I could lure you out for a steak and some gin here in civilization. :)" (the smiley is so you don't sound bitter when you say it)

We all have to do things we don't like for people we really like. Right now I'm stuck in the 80 degree car while my husband refuses to turn on the a/c, listening to music I don't like, and having to pretend that I care the Sox lost to the Twins today. But tonight he'll have to pretend he's not annoyed when I leave him with the baby and read in bed for a half hour. That's life! :) 




 Where you go to college isn't going to have much of an impact on who takes you on as a game warden, so if you really want to live in Maine, going to school there might be the perfect way to ensure you get a couple years in.  I mean, it's beautiful country... But there are so many beautiful places in these here United States.  You should see Oregon and Montana and Virginia State, and hell, even Northern Minnesota.  :) 




 Most states have job boards that you can sort by profession, here is the one for Maine: http://www.maine.gov/portal/employment/jobs.html

You can also check out the IFW website: http://www.maine.gov/ifw/warden_service/index.html

Here in other parts of the world, we call it the DNR or Department of Natural Resources... took me a minute to find the equivalent in Maine.  Hope this helps! :)  




 Hello.  I'm sorry that you're having such a tough time.  You seem like a hard worker who really cares about her family.  Have you looked into any housing programs in your state?  Here in MN we have a thing called 1 Roof.  If you meet a certain income guideline, you can just take a class on homeownership and prove that you can keep $1000 in your bank account for one month, and then you can get a mortgage without having to make a down payment.  They even have companion programs for if you need to do home repairs.  My advice is to look into what government assistance programs are in your area.  A lot of places also offer free financial planning assistance, so if you're struggling to budget, you can educate yourself.  I'm not sure if any of this will help you, but I hope that it does!   




 This person knows their stuff, inevitably when you are actually up there, your nerves will cause you to speak more quickly than you did when you practiced.  If you keep this in mind, you'll be able to maintain pace. :)  
























 In June of 2014 I was on the verge of needing medication to cope with job anxiety.  I was six months pregnant.  It was hot outside.  My former company forced me to go on two last business trips before I left for good in August.  I was salaried and working about 56 hours a week.  I'm really glad it's not June of 2014.  




 OMG... the parallels!  I read and knit... My husband shaves his head, right?  I joked that he was basically Nostferatu once... He did not like that at all.  Ahahaha, this is such a small world.  Thank you for the comment. 3   




 Someone is going to click on this and wonder what the hell happened.  Ahahaha.  




 I try to be a good wife.  I pre-ordered [this](http://store.misfit.com/products/bolt?gclid=CjwKEAjwqLWrBRC-_OaG-IfL0kASJAAbzKsVbpRky11625fR9yZLmpV-PYcJf4H17n_Ui0fOQ2pUhRoC-dvw_wcB) for him for his birthday... I think it was the most successful gift I've ever given in my life.   




 I like your spirit!  However, I'm married (and not to cabinet maker, to someone who can't hold a screwdriver) so my cabinet acquiring days outside of the Home Depot are over. :(  Such is life.  




 When they legalize polygamy in one of our countries, we'll make it happen.  




 Until you wrote this, I had no idea that melatonin had to do with circadian rhythm function... You might be on to something.... he never comes to bed on time.  Basically, if this were Harvest Moon for SNES, he would be abandoned by now.    




 In our old apartment, if I needed to see something properly, I had to go into the bathroom.  It was the only room in the whole house he never tampered with.  




 Well, your comments are awesome, I upvoted a ton of them, but sorry cool kid from the UK, I'm married.  It's okay, though, I'm sure I'm too old and possibly too short for your anyhow.  




 He hates being in a properly lit room.  I'm forever coming home to find all the lightbulbs have been switched to the colored kinds that don't actually throw light.... It's very frustrating to turn on a lamp and have things not get brighter.  It's also annoying to leave the room to take a leak and come back to find all the lights have been turned off.  All my houseplants are dying because of the black-out curtains.  

I'm not making this up.  This is a real point of contention in my marriage.  




 Well, this did make me laugh out loud, and that's always a plus. ;) 




 Probably a cabinetmaker.  That would indicate to me that a man is precise, patient, intelligent, perfectionistic, artistic, strong, handy, and focused.   




 If money can't buy happiness, you don't know where to shop! ;) 




 That buzz of connection when you talk to someone and they understand you and you understand them.  It's the opposite of loneliness.   









 This is very hard to put into words because it's not logical in any way, shape, or form.  It's an anxiety behavior for me.  I see a text (especially from someone who makes me uncomfortable like my mother in law) and I don't know what to say.  I agonize over it for a moment.  Come up with nothing.  Get illogically angry at the sender for putting me in this situation, set it aside.  Remember at a later time, fret that too much time has passed for a normal response... continue to do nothing..... I actually cut my former boss out of my life completely just because I never knew what to say to her and couldn't force myself to guess what she might've meant. 




 His mother.  You NEVER criticize an SO's family to your SO.  They will take it personally and it accomplishes nothing. 




 "Where is my Mind" by the Pixies reminds me of the Tracey Fragments.  When they released the film, they did a promo where they released all the raw images to be re-mixed by fans.  Someone did [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVjY7xD6W24) awesome reFragment as it was called.  They did a better job than the movie in a lot of ways!  




 My sister had a car she had totaled twice.  I was driving the damn thing around with the steering wheel airbag compartment and the glove box held shut with zip-ties.  My stepdad had cut the airbags out with a carpet knife, so they were just these raggedy tatters you saw peeping out behind the zip-ties.  I didn't really care, I mean, it got me from point A to point B for much longer than I would have thought it could. :) 

Edit: I finally remembered the name of it!  It was a '96 Ford Contour.   




 This kid and I went out for breakfast.  He made no effort to make conversation and his answers to my questions were monosyllabic or brooked no discussion.  The one that took the cake was when I asked him what kind of music he liked and he said "Don't really like music.  There was a Greenday song that was alright."

WELP.  I guess I'll see you around...  




 Well, it was my understanding that Brits had an even larger tendency towards modesty than we did, but I could be wrong.  It's to do with the fact that we don't like to admit that we have to eliminate waste bodily.  See what I did there?    




 Be awkward and malnourished.  I don't have a type per say, unless emaciated is a type.  I like 'em hungry looking.  




 Killer Mike has a song for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lIqNjC1RKU 




 I'd like to point out that in my experience "taking a leak" is something men do.  I like to say it as a female, and I almost always get derisive laughter when I do.

We call it a restroom because we don't have bath tubs at work, so it's not a bathroom! :) 




 WOW.  That sub-comment.  Really though, I don't wear leggings with anything but a dress, HOWEVER, I can give you my guess.  Our hips are shaped in a way that is not super conducive to comfortable pants.  Add to this the trend that jeans need to be tight, the comeback of the highwaist, and the fact that all work pants are miserable, it's likely just a comfort thing.  We can't put things in our tiny pockets anyway, so we're not really missing function by ditching them.  




 I think probably by sending their nudes to their place of employment.... Or maybe by kidnapping your child and disappearing... really anything that not only ends the relationship, but also ruins the rest of your life.  




 I used to use tricks that boys had used on me to feel me up on boys.  Like you reach for something on the other side of them but drag your arm across them getting it, or you hand them something but press your knuckles against their chest when you do so, or you lose balance and grab onto them in the process.  

Invariably, they looked shocked and mortified.     




 100% down hill, no other answer.  Walking UP the hill relieves the pressure on your feet.  Going down you feel like you're going to topple over and lose your shoes!  




 I was a pretty literal child.  I had a constant fear of not being able to accomplish a directive my mother had given me.  So when she told me that I was to keep my hands folded in my lap and be still, I was very concerned about the fact that my hands didn't seem to want to fold.  

I was also TERRIFIED when a babysitter told me if I didn't do something I would be "dead meat."  I thought she was going to kill me and put me in the freezer.  




 It's okay... when I was four I told my mom I wanted to be an artist.  She told me that artists don't get paid anything until they were dead and so I needed to be more realistic.  Flash forward to a year later, I attended my first funeral and decided I wanted to be like the friendly mortician I met there.  This lasted until I was about 14.  I hope you laughed at this, I was trying to cheer you up.  (But I'm also 100% serious.)

Edit: I totally said I wanted to be a mortician in more than one school publication in the local newspaper.  Ha ha, mom.  




 I know that feel, man.  For me it was my mother.  She also told me that if a group of people don't like you, because there are more of them than there are of you, they must be seeing something you are doing wrong and have a valid point.  You and I will forever second guess ourselves, but at least we will almost certainly survive any crisis since we're constantly imagining the worst possible scenario at any given time. ;) 




 My sister and I have the same nightmare... if we see a swing or a tether ball or anything else that hangs from something, you can bet we're going to end up swinging wildly around in the sky while we panic.  It's quite awful...  




 You know, there is an exchange about this very thing in the dystopia movie "Antiviral."  In it, they sell cloned meat made from the DNA of celebrities.  Syd Winter says to Arvid "I still don't understand how this isn't cannibalism."  Arvid replies that the current popular opinion is that what makes us human is more spiritual than physical.  Our soul in other words.  




 It's commonly believed that it means one of two things:

You're afraid of your own mortality.  Teeth are a sign of power and health.  You lose both as you age.

You said something you wish you hadn't. 




 Uncomfortable.  You have to understand that your outward appearance is hardly an accomplishment that says anything about what kind of person you are.  Just like having dimples or a big pregnant belly, being beautiful makes people think you're public property in a way that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  You owe people things, people get defensive more easily, you're not taken as seriously.   




 Yes, my astonishment at the fact that a huge part of my job was reformatting things in Microsoft Word and ghost writing e-mails for people with three more college majors than me was quite great.   




 Almost anything they sell in an infomercial.  If you want to laugh until you cry, go to Amazon and read the reviews for the MyPillow and the NoNo hair remover.  




 [Thank you for being a friend.](http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2015/news/150420/golden-girls-01-800.jpg) 




 It is like this: you put in at least 1% and after 1 year they will match 5% OF YOUR SALARY.  At the 5 year mark it jumps to 10% OF YOUR SALARY.... Can you even believe that people still decline participation?  It blows my mind!  

I've decided that I have to stay here at least until my daughter stops needing daycare (and I can divert 20% into my Roth 401k), no matter how brain dead it's making me.  




 It's a really stupid story involving my younger sister and the Simon and Garfunkel cover of "My Little Town."  A totally inane story that I never get sick of telling anyone who has ever met my sister.   




 I told my friend about the retirement matching in my company (it's mind-bogglingly good), and he got very excited for me.  Then he made a comment about how we must officially be adults since this is what we're congratulating ourselves on. ;) 




 Well, because you can learn a lot from fiction as well.  A lot of people are not able to apply third person narrative to their lives... it's too abstract and objective and lacks feeling.  When you are reading fiction from a first person perspective, you become that person.  Learning isn't just about facts and figures, it's also about having compassion and learning not to judge everything at face value.  I hope this helps you! :)  




 In high school I had hair down to my hipbones that I pretty much never brushed and I tended to wear a minimum of three shirts... yes, like a homeless person.  When I graduated high school, I cut off all my hair into a pixie cut and moved to a place where it was too hot to pretend to be Rivers Cuomo.  I started working at a Gamestop.  I got phone numbers daily.  Boys would hand me things and "accidently" touch my chest.  My assistant manager printed movie labels he trimmed as commentary for our name tags... I got "The Hot Chick."  

Now, I suspected then that I might be cute, but figured it was more like I was a skinny 6/10 with boobs who played video games.  It wasn't until Tiny Chat that I realized I was regarded as actually beautiful.  When strangers on the internet start hiding all cams but yours and taking screenshots, you just have to wonder.  It wasn't until someone who I literally think is a 10 asked me out of jealousy what it was like to have everyone vying for my attention that I was like maybe I'm missing something here.  

I don't treat anyone differently, I'm just now all the more anxious because it's one more thing that isn't how I think it is. 




 IS MONOPOLY MONEY OKAY???? :D :D :D 




 Yessss, I will take three Quarter Pounders with cheese... oh, and can I get a diet Coke with that? ;)  




 I think we can all relate to not having anything to say to certain people, right?  I've never really made fun of someone for their height, but I'm uncommonly short (just under 5'), and I don't think people do it very seriously.  They're just trying to get my attention and not very clever!  What I think is more obnoxious is how if you tell them this is not clever or original, you're the bad guy... hahaha! 

tl;dr: We can't talk about the weather all the time. 




 I'm not going to type out a huge long story, but my worst boyfriend used to use me as an excuse to get out of things he didn't want to do.  He would lie to his family and work about me being super controlling or about cruel things I apparently said so he wouldn't have to see them or work.  It took me a long time to work out what was going on.  If his mother weren't such a direct person I probably never would have... she called me out on things I had "said" and I felt like the floor fell out from under me!

Yeah, he was a bit crazy, I'd say.  




 I've read that it takes 1 year for your stomach muscles to go back to pre-pregnancy shape if they didn't damage during the late pregnancy.  My stomach looks normal until I eat something.... when I get bloated my stomach is round like I'm 4 months pregnant.  This is hilarious (in a sad way) since I'm down to 107 lbs (I'm just under 5'), but I'm sure it'll pass.  I don't think the droop goes anywhere though.  At least we're in good company! :) 




 Good: Be random.  I have a very abstract sense of humor, I like people who can hang. :)

Bad: Pouting.  I can't handle pouting.  Don't pout.   




 You can't win 'em all. ;) 




 Right, I used to tell people I was named after the "CALL ATT girl," but I haven't made that joke in years since no one has CALLED ATT in a very long time ;) 




 http://i.imgur.com/oReaT.jpg This one made me laugh my ass off.  Relevant!  




 I like it! :) 




 Using a card catalogue.  Guys, have you gone back and checked what World Book had to say about the solar system in 1992?  That shit is hilarious!  This is how we used to educate ourselves?!   




 When my mother said "Maybe it's time to switch to a less reliable form of birth control."   




 If you do not eviscerate all of the children under the age of five within the next hour, we will nuke your entire town.  

I have neighbors.  They know I have a baby... how the hell do I get her out?  Terrifying.  




 Tom Arnold. 




 And I remember my social studies teacher telling us about people using a wheelbarrow to transport all the cash they needed to buy a single loaf of bread in Russia!  Inflation!  It's real! :)  




 There's a lot of shame for physical issues/conditions that are gender specific.  People don't want to hear about lochia or episiotomies or yeast infections.  I'm trying to think of something a guy could bring up that would cause a similar immediate reaction of distaste or disgust, and I'm coming up short.  I was familiar with the term "pre-mature ejaculation" before I reached my adult height!   




 Name the Wind.... My best friend told me it's like Harry Potter for grown-ups, but I'm just like son of a bitch, I'm sick of these spiders...  




 I actually think it must just be poor context.  The only context of this word that I've ever heard that stuck with me was when it was used in those mid-90's Duncan Heines commercials... Moist is totally something I like in a cake.  Now congeal?  Or coagulate? PASS ON THAT.   




 Did you know that in 1920 the average cost of a house was a hair under $4,000?

Obviously if we all got $1,000,000 the inflation would kill our economy and while I'm not quite sure what the worldwide aftershock would be, I'm sure it would be horrifying.  




 This is why I volunteer with a hospice!   




 No, but it's for a totally practical reason: That would wreck the pH in our little lady environments.  I mean, lots of things do, but hell, let's not totally throw reason out the window here... If that wasn't a concern, I'd totally be down. 




 Well, this is irrelevant now being that she is too old to be president realistically... but for awhile there I was hoping Arnold would succeed in his bid to have the constitution amended to allow foreigners who have had US Citizenship for x number of years to be eligible for presidency so that Madeline Albright could have run.  It didn't happen, but she's the person I would have wanted leading my country in 2000.    




 Oh my god, you guys.  Upvotes for everyone.  Thanks for making me cry laughing in my office. 

Contribution so this isn't just a useless post: raisins.  I can't imagine eating raisins could ever be sexy in an unironic way.  




 I think it depends on whether you bought one on impulse or if you're a serious quantified lifer.  I know a kid who has been using his Jawbone to create sophisticated Excel charts that cross reference all kinds of crazy things.  It's pretty much his favorite hobby.  He's been doing it for years! 




 Anytime you have to have what my former boss called "the smelly kid conversation."  Nothing is more awkward than setting someone down and telling them their coworkers are concerned because you don't seem to shower, use deodorant, or change your clothes.

I've had to have this chat with three employees and I've sat in as a second for many, many more.  Remember kids, don't ever have this or a conversation about dress code without a witness.  




 My anxiety makes it very scary for me to think about watching movies I haven't seen before with other people, and if they have already seen the movie, it ratchets that anxiety up to 11.  I know this probably sounds really silly, but it's a thing.  Your friend could be coming from the same place.  It's worth considering.

The last time I had to see a movie with friends, I read the novel and another film adaptation of the source material to "prepare," I haven't seen a movie with friends in almost four years! 




 Well, sometimes you can't do anything that's obvious, you know?  He clearly loves you and trusts you to tell you about it.  He might not ever mention it again, and that's fine.  If he wants help, he'll probably ask for it.   When a sexual abuse occurs, the person involved feels powerless and out of control.  One very subtle way you can help your father is to ask to do things with him that he's really good at and that you're only so-so or bad at.  I can't give you a great example, but say he is a master fisherman.... ask him to take you fishing, ask questions, thank him for teaching you if you think it won't embarrass him. 

I don't want to give you advice about how to handle your uncle, because every family dynamic is different and there are a few factors.  I guess the best advice I can give is to remember what you know and use that knowledge to sort of keep an eye out for any other potential victims.  Intervene in a subtle way when appropriate.  

I'd be happy to talk about this further if you want.  Just shoot me a PM. 




 This is just like Batman vs. Superman.  OF COURSE the ants will win, they are ants... Just like Superman is an ALIEN.  Batman and humanity can only hope to get a few shots in with our expensive toys and our wits, but we all know it's just a matter of time...  




 Well, judging by the films made in the 70's that were set in the future, I think it would be hard to believe that smoking became LESS prevalent, not more!    




 I don't know what you all are talking about... my mom makes mom jokes all the time... they're like this: "Well, you can do what you want to do... BUT YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ;)"  or  "I know you think I'm stupid, so you'll just do what you want..."  It's a joke because no matter what you do, you're screwed.  All you can do is laugh... until you cry.  




 I actually never had any.  I was tempted to lie since people took this as license to have a very long and stupid conversation about their disbelief that this was the actual case.  When you're that pregnant, you don't want to have the same unoriginal conversation every two hours.  I also got tired of people coming to my office and saying "You're still here!"  YES, OBVIOUSLY.  




 I got a breadmaker for Christmas one year.  I was trying to make bread a week later and I couldn't find my half-cup measure anywhere.

I asked my husband about it.  He said he "maybe, might have thrown it away, but can't remember exactly..."  I was understandably annoyed and told him it would be very difficult to make bread without it since you have to be so precise for things to turn out well.

An hour later he came into the house from outside with the measuring cup and said to me "Look!  It's a New Year's Miracle!"  




 I blitzed through the "His Dark Materials" trilogy in a weekend.  If you're asking for the purpose of school, I recommend it purely on the basis that there are a lot of topics in it that make for great essays.   




 Something that I really like is when a guy is handy.  If you can do car repairs or build things it indicates to me that you have a natural curiosity about the world and that you're pragmatic.  Handy guys who spend a lot of time out in their garages also don't tend to be co-dependent.  They know the value of personal accomplishment.  That is a beautiful thing! :) 




 No screen time before (and definitely not in) bed.  Go to bed a bit earlier than you need to fall asleep (I like an hour), and read.  I like to read things I'm interested in, but are unarguably a bit boring like novels by Thomas Hardy or Jane Austen.  They are great to sleep to.  You don't want to have coffee or other caffeinated drinks within 8 hours of your bedtime.  Don't exercise before bed.  It can be helpful to start a night-time ritual, like taking a shower, putting on your pajamas, turning off all the lights in your house in a certain order, reading for a half hour.  Studies show that our bodies respond to memory of ritual and you will begin to get tired during step one after your body begins to correlate that you only shower before you sleep...it also lowers your body temp, which makes you tired.  Invest in a white noise machine (not a sound machine).  Be active while you're awake.    




 This actually reads very nicely to me.  My only comment is that if this person is going to be a supervisor you may want to focus more on things that make a good supervisor (constantly developing personally, sensitive to the needs of others, hardworking, innovative, diplomatic) and a tiny bit less on their great deal of heart (for lack of a better term). You don't want him to seem too emotional for the job, and let's face it, a lot of people can't do supervisor work for just that reason.  You get pretty beat up!  




 After I had my baby, I tried to go back and play the Sims 3 one day... I managed to snatch an uninterrupted hour (a miracle) and accomplish decorating half a Sim house (read: absolutely nothing accomplished).  It put into perspective that I had probably dumped hundreds upon hundreds of hours into video games.

It's good that you would like to go out and do things, and therein lies your opportunity to meet like-minded folks.  Now you're probably going to find that at a wine-tasting there's going to be a lot of 40-something soccer moms that zone out when you try to speak to them, just don't give up.  Eventually you will find someone in your various activities that will jump at the chance to do other fun things with you.  

You're right about body image, it starts on the inside.  If you're serious about bulking up, there is a lot of science and theory to be had, which will appeal to your intellectual side.  I recommend you look into intermittent fasting in muscle building.  It will challenge everything you have been brought up to believe about eating. 

If you really have anxiety, you will probably always struggle with it to some degree.  I'm high-functioning, but still very high anxiety.  I will notice little innocuous things I'm doing, like putting off a phone call and then have to talk myself up in my head to stop that behavior.  The key to avoiding missed opportunities due to anxiety is to just question your negativity.  Try to see things from another angle.  If you think "Wow, this person is really rude... they must not like me. :(" Take a step back and think about the last time you said something with the specific intention of hurting another person.  You probably can't come up with one, because that's not really how we function as human beings.  That other person is the same as you and probably meant no harm.  

I hope this helps you! :)

 White ratty gym socks with pants that are just a hair too short.  




 Hard to argue with happiness, I suppose, but man... how awful. ;) 




 I have a cousin whose middle name is "T," as in just a letter, nothing longer.  Apparently "T" is the first initial of his mother, his father, both uncles, and I think a few other people besides.  She couldn't think of who to honor, so she left it open to interpretation.  




 Aw snap, here we go.  The first time my mother met this old dude next door, he was walking around with bread bags tied over his shoes... he was phobic of dog feces. 

He told her that he used to work, but didn't because he had a total meltdown and ended up in a mental institution for five years. 

He used to randomly fire his hunting rifle into the woods behind our houses from his deck.  Not aiming, just firing.  

He didn't play the radio, because it transmits the sound from your house to the government.  

One time my mom was watching birds in the backyard with her binoculars.  There was Milt... watching her with binoculars from his yard.

We were under strict orders to never talk to him alone.   




 Peppermint Schnapps.  Listen guys, don't ever play a drinking game like "Never Have I Ever" with Peppermint Schnapps.  It's been 7 years and thinking about it still makes me gag.  




 Eating more than five olives in one sitting will give you an amazingly painful stomach ache.  Apparently my mother was very passionate about keeping the olives in the house.   




 Black Hills Energy was the only utility company that I ever encountered that treated their customers as their number 1 priority, and I have encountered a lot of utility companies in my former profession.  Would recommend/10.  




 After I put in my two weeks at Gamestop, I just like, gave no fucks.  The best time was when this kid came in.  I greeted him, as was required.  He ignored my greeting.  Pretended to look around, then made his way back to me to turn in a job application.  I said "Let me get this straight.... you want me to give you a job, but you didn't even return my greeting?  You do know that greeting people is, like 30% of this job right?"  He was actually a sport and said "Oh man! I didn't know I was at a pre-interview, how can I convince you?  Do I still have a shot?" I said it depended and what did he know about video games?  He proceeded to reveal that the only game he had ever played ever was Megaman on SNES.  You better believe I slapped a do-not-bother post-it on that application.  No regrets, I'm 100% sure he didn't want to do what I was doing for the pitiful wage of $5.15/hr.  He dodged a bullet and didn't even know it.  




 Get yourself one of these puppies: http://www.amazon.com/Munchkin-Baby-Food-Grinder-Light/dp/B000GB0NZA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1432999738 sr=8-1 keywords=food+grinder+baby

Mix it with other things once it's the texture of mashed potatoes if you don't just want to cook it with garlic and olive oil and eat it like that. :) 

Brocoli is pretty much a super food, so I get it!  I'd also try it a few other ways... like is it raw that bothers you?  Just cooked?  Heads? Stems?  Identify what bothers you, and try to work around it.  Good luck, friend!  




 Have you tired /r/kindvoice or /r/needafriend ?  Both tend to have offers all the time with a/s listed.

I'm too old for you, or I'd offer. :) 




 Not to sound like I'm wearing a tin-foil hat here, but a number of things I've noticed went hay-wire on the internet on Memorial Day.  I think the government knows why and possibly were involved while we all celebrated what Facebook tells me isn't national barbecue day.

 Absolutely, man.  There could be something bigger at play here... like a company reorganization or the company being purchased by a parent company.   




 Thank you for using "tall poppy syndrome" which prompted me to google what that means, which informed me there is a word for a thing that I see all the time!  I'm going to be speaking much more efficiently now! :) 




 mfw it is already happening.  We're expelling carbon dioxide.  If we don't, we die.  Did I just break your time-space continuum?  Tell me, bby.  




 Right, I'm not going to name names here, but a very large utility was paying their direct hires $35.00/hr to take phone calls, while they paid only $16.99 per dedicated hour for our agents to take the same calls.  (We paid these agents about $8.50/hr)  As one of the other contributors pointed out, pay differential aside, they didn't need to cover any benefits for us.  They also weren't spending money on coaching.  All of that was on our dime, so they had the freedom to mandate we meet certain goals, save themselves money while we worked with the agents, and ultimately leave if we didn't deliver.   There is a reason why these numbers are normally private and thus why you would be confused.   




 I think it's quite beautiful to recognize that you're young at heart and to be young for as long as you can be.  I mean, we're only getting older, you'll never get the chance again.  

I think you just need to do some things that make you feel smart and competent.  For me, that is traveling.  I never feel as smart and free and independent as I do when I'm in an airport.  When you travel alone, you can indulge in your childlike wonder at the world around you.  You can be you without thinking yourself to death the way you do when you're just home alone.  

It's good to think the best of people and to be curious about them.  That alone will get you far as many people love to talk about themselves.  If you ask questions, typically you don't need to worry about expressing yourself too well, because the other person will go on a bit.  While I can be a chatty Kathy (obviously) I'm intrinsically curious about why people do what they do and how and what they feel about it.  So while I am largely awkward, having met my best friend at 23, a lot of people consider me to be their friend merely on merit that I've asked them things and listened to their answers and remembered little things about them. 

The wonderful thing about being a human being is that if we don't like our circumstances, there is rarely a situation where we can't change them completely.  I totally encourage you to think about the things you like to imagine you are brave enough to do and to just do them.  No one ever lies in their deathbed and says "I wish I had spent more time worrying and waiting to start my life," right?  Be brave and be you and do everything you want to do.  You deserve it.  You only live in this wonderful world once. :) 




 I'll chime in again, hey, why not.  Another thing my husband gets a lot is the description that he looks like Mr. Clean.  

What?  My husband is 160 lbs soaking wet at 6'2"... he's not a ripped old man in a small t-shirt.  He also doesn't have bushy white eyebrows or blue eyes or a killer tan.  He doesn't have a pierced ear and he doesn't wear jeans.... Are you saying he's bald?  Yes.  He happens to be bald.  




 I'm sorry that you're having such a rough time.  I can't speak about your culture and I won't presume to, but you asked if it was true whether no matter where a man is from, he'd be bothered.  The answer to that is no.  I'm an American.  I did not come into my marriage as a virgin.  My husband could not care less.  

I hope things get better for you.  Please feel free to PM me if you're ever lonely and need a sympathetic ear.  You are more than your currency as a potential mate. 
























 [Here you go.  Not really rare, but pretty hilarious.] (http://staygoofymyfriends.tumblr.com/post/110935760098/surprisebitch-weavemunchers-so-real-delete?utm_campaign=SharedPost utm_medium=Email utm_source=TumblriOS) 




 "Let's talk this over, it's not like we're dead..." Okay.

"Was it something I did?  Was it something you said...?" This barely makes sense, but I'll go with it.

"Don't leave me hanging in a city so dead..." YOU ALREADY SAID DEAD IN LINE ONE AVRIL GODDAMN IT.

"Held up so high on such a breakable thread...." Redundant.  Get out. 




 My current bathroom is tiny (for those of you that have ever played the Sims, it is literally four squares, meaning that your Sim couldn't use the sink).  I can't actually make it any bigger without cutting into the nursery, turning it into a closet essentially.  There is a multi-piece stall shower in it that leaks and isn't connected to the walls.  When I take a shower, it's like having water dumped on my head since it only shoots about a foot above my head.  Basically I have a bathroom from hell.  If I had 100k, I would add onto my house so I could put in an all in one-piece acrylic bathtub-shower combo, I would replace all the floorboards under my current set-up. I'd make sure my walls had cement board in them (my whole bathroom is hollow dry wall, I'm not even kidding).     




 Really any time someone changes a pronunciation to force a rhyme.  The most common offence being changing "Me" to "May," I'm looking at you, Hinder, Kelly Clarkson, Katy Perry, N*SYNC and like a million others....  




 Lol, no... I'm pointing out that what she said was in no way definitive.  She said "I like..." not "I MUST HAVE OR NO HOW NO WAY..."   




 I like guys over 6ft.  




 I think this pretty much says it all, man: https://twitter.com/teknogeisha/status/576023004318212097 




 I use tarot cards as a way of bringing my subconscious or uncomfortable thoughts into the forefront.  A lot of times we have a sneaking suspicion we know the answers to things, but we don't want to admit it so we push it down.  Tarot is a gentle prompt to confront those thoughts and examine your motives.  

Even when my cards seem to make no sense to me initially, after a minute I'm always able to apply them in some new way that forces me to use a different viewpoint.

I don't really believe in fortune telling, but I do believe they're a valuable psychological tool.  




 I have no idea why there is so much discussion on "female-condoms," they have a higher failure rate and I've only ever even SEEN one in sex-ed class.  Probably a jokeshop gag/10.  




 Urinating.  I can't be the only person who laughs to themselves when they nip off to have a piss.  I think it's probably only enjoyable because you get a moment alone to laugh about how much fun you're having.  




 Well up until that point, I'd been going to my family doctor.  At that time I weighed about 95 pounds and I'm only 4'11.5"... so my doctor would use the smallest speculum she had.  This appointment was at a Planned Parenthood a state away.  Those duckbills were fucking comparable to a damn Swingline stapler before they were even open... I'd never seen anything like them before or since.  Also, I'm not quite sure what she was doing down there, but it didn't seem to me to be business as usual.  It felt like she swabbed me (read: scratched the hell out of my cervix) at least four times.  




 During the worse pelvic exam of my life (I felt like my organs had been rearranged for three days after), the GYN said "Your cervix is a nice bubblegum pink color... it's beautiful!  DO YOU WANT TO SEE IT?  I have a mirror!"  

Like no, you crazy bitch, take that speculum out and let me slink off to cry in my car.  




 [The hand.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/11/94/6e/11946e7cde1c46bf18dd2eea7d1ad18d.jpg) 

I went into some sort of minor obsession with this damn picture in which I would save it to my phone and then delete it like five times a day.  Just when I thought I'd kicked it, my mom picture mailed it to me.  




 [Messiah of Evil](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071396/)

This is available on Amazon Prime.  I have two versions, one was included in some 50 Horror Movies compilation and the other was the directors cut.  Of the two, I like the grainy one... It's that poorly mastered version you'll find on Amazon.  Hold onnnn to lovvvve!  




 This re-press is actually from Germany, not the UK as was theorized in /r/vinylreleases It's pressed on 180 gram vinyl.  There are no liner notes, but it does come with a digital redemption code.  Considering the original is about $250 on discogs, this was definitely exciting for me.  I hope this helps someone! :) 









 Every time I re-read "Far From the Madding Crowd," I find it gets funnier.  Hardy is so prone to flowery prose that I only recently got just how often he's speaking to us with his tongue in his cheek.  This novel was never a school assignment for me, but I can definitely say after four read-throughs, I get more out of it each time. :) 




 I was scrolling, there were flowers and pictures of food and then all of a sudden there was dead Chris Farley.  Now I am sure that a lot of my distaste had to do with being ill-prepared for that moment, but when you see someone that you felt you knew and liked looking like that, it's a much bigger shock than some random person you never saw alive.  




 Nah man, I added you to my friends list.  You're pretty consistently angry sounding with a dash of sincere and well-meaning.  I mean, how often do you post on some unoriginal question some smart-ass crack about how often you've seen some variation on that question 12x today?  I think you do it on average five times a day or so.  If you don't believe me, click on your username and imagine you're reading it all for the first time.  




 Say the words "You're right, I was wrong."  Not to me, but you know, if someone says that and means it, especially in the workplace, it counts for an awful lot.  




 Well, and I was clearly wrong, but I thought so because I remembered you posting something about being a Vietnam Vet.  Now clearly that never happened, but you know, the grouchy persona doesn't help.  You're cranky like a much older man.  You're also very well written and sharp as a tack.  You don't see that too often during the early twenties... It typically comes later.  




 Watch it pal, you'll be my age in three short years. ;) 




 Do you mean "A Serbian Film?"  What the hell is a Syrian Film?  Is that about oil?  




 Not anymore, young'un.   




 What was that stupid movie about the guy trying to track down the source of some dead guy's snuff movie?  Whatever it was called, it would make a hysterical musical.  Would watch/10. 




 Obviously you would send them [the hand](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/11/94/6e/11946e7cde1c46bf18dd2eea7d1ad18d.jpg). 




 Are you for real?  I'm OLDER than you.  It's a good thing I admitted to running Mac OS after all.   




 Is it bad that my first impulse was to NOT tell you that I am running Mac OS so you wouldn't find me even less attractive?  Because it was, and I am.  




 When I have new updates, it slides out a little sign over my other windows, that's not the weird part... the weird part is that right in that box it asks me if I want to just never update my OS again.  I hate that window so much I almost do it every time.  




 This is so fucking honest it's actually heartbreaking.  




 My mom would always get put out if we paid too much attention to her when she first came home.  I totally know that feeling now.  Like, let me set my stuff down and take my shoes off!  




 Go forth!  Spread the gospel of the downstairs mixer! Ahahaha!  




 Goodness, do you think so?  My intention was to insinuate that you would never be so shallow to take a trait such as extreme flexibility as the biggest asset in any relationship, and the assumption was that no one who had ever snared such reluctant quarry would let him go.  




 If you had a girlfriend who was flexible enough to tie herself up so severely she needed medical intervention, I wonder why on earth you ever left her?  Did the novelty wear off?  Or are you insinuating she was a light-weight?  




 I want to hear anything you have to say to me. 3  




 I call my lady bits my "downstairs mixer" which is a bastardization of the "downstairs mix-up" of Old Gregg on the Mighty Boosh.  




 If you actually said to me that you were going to make me love you, I'd probably laugh in your face Bathsheba Everdene style.  I want a man who can tame me, but I don't actually believe that's possible.  The only way I would be upset with a man for saying such a thing would be if he was panting.  Or had broken in.  Otherwise, I'd admire his pluck.  




 Technically I could be a catfish who likes angry old men because I am one.  You never can tell.   




 I'm going to make you love me.  Anne Boleyn is my spirit animal.  




 I'm glad that no one disputed this is the perfect crime. 




 Probably because you're capable of playful DnD banter with historical references, but if a gal says "throw it in reverse for thirst" (A stupid Sprite commercial reference), you curse her to a life of celibacy.  We can't be all things to all men, sir.  




 Guess I failed that bluff check, should've put more into Charisma. _

 [If you Sleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG4mmjeunC0) by Tal Bachman.  He's just fucking strolling around all happy with his girlfriend... the song is about visiting your SO in a mental health facility after a suicide attempt, with the eventual outcome that they succeed a second attempt.  What the hell record company?!  




 That was pretty hostile, man.  You don't have to call me a dick.  An alternative would be to educate me.  Novel, huh? 




 Jeremiah Johnson:

Goes to mountains, family dies, kills a ton of Indians, gives up.  




 I'm not a dad, but I am a mother to a seven month old daughter.  My husband had no prior experience with babies, in fact, the extent of his interaction was to hold his niece one time for about three minutes.  But he is the most wonderful father I've ever seen in real life.  He is always asking me to show him things and explain them and then he just runs with it.  He's more patient than I am, he takes photos constantly, and he brags about her to anyone who will listen despite being shy to the point of never speaking in most situations.  

The fact that you're worried just goes to show that you're going to do a wonderful job.  If you were a bad father, you wouldn't care.  Congratulations, daddy!  




 If they were a toddler, I wouldn't even hesitate.  




 Okay, now I have to ask... I've seen you around, and I've typed this question to you three times and deleted it each time... Is your username a reference to the Stephen King short story?  I think it was called "Strawberry Spring...?" 




 Did you just guilt gilt me?  I mean, I'm like, super excited, but wow!  You didn't have to do that. 3

 I think you need to rethink this... maybe read the lyrics once.

 A sports talk radio station (or as I like to call it, AM Radio Lite), I don't really watch television, but maybe the Discovery Channel?  As I understand it it has a lot of variety these days.  The artist would be Ryan Adams or Neil Young.  Both are so prolific I can't imagine getting sick of them or not having new stuff to listen to several times a year.

 It's not too complicated, you just mix a bit of olive brine in with your cream cheese and add sliced green olives. :)

 Cream Cheese and Olives!  




 I'd say my mother in law, but the truth is that I only think about drinking... I don't need to give her another reason to subversively criticize me in front of my spouse. :-/ 




 Copy-Paste from another comment I left, I think it applies here too: 

I used to use tricks that boys had used on me to feel me up on boys. Like you reach for something on the other side of them but drag your arm across them getting it, or you hand them something but press your knuckles against their chest when you do so, or you lose balance and grab onto them in the process. 

Invariably, they looked shocked and mortified. 

I didn't actually have any sort of conversation about this, I was just being awkward to amuse myself.  




 I'm not trying to be a contrarian, but "separation of church and state" is not part of the first amendment.  It was the causation for the meeting as noted in a letter by Thomas Jefferson that resulted in the drafting of the first amendment.  The phrase never made it in, it's not nearly so explicit.

 THANK YOU.... Now I'll be able to sleep tonight.  You're the best! :) 




 Look, full disclosure, I don't even get the joke I made.  I have no fucking idea what is going on today and how June 3rd is related to the PS4 or any other damn thing.... but I think I might have answered one of those questions seriously... it was vague, like "It's June 2014, what are you mad about?"   




 This doesn't bother me in the least, it's that the people I love will stop existing.  You never know another person completely, so when they die, all those things and all that potential dies too.  You're not going to care when you are dead, you will be dead.  




 Well, I should clarify, I guess... I'm not actually against bonsai, I was just pointing out that a lot of people thing it's something it's not, namely miniature trees.  They are full sized trees that have been manipulated.  I was just joking with that suave /u/satnavtomington

Do what you will! :)  




 Don't speak to me, tree mutilator.  AT WHAT COST, I ask you? 




 How has your life changed since June 3rd, 2014? 




 A bonsai tree is essentially tree torture.  Dwarf trees are pretty much a myth.  You just hack a normal tree half to death and then manipulate it if it survives.  If you want to learn about building a hobbit house, google "fairy gardens." 




 Yeah, absolutely.  Love is respect is a fucking cliche.  While you probably have both love and respect for people most of the time, you can absolutely love people you don't respect.  People who are lazy or victims or whatever.   




 Kind of lame.  I mean, I'm sure it depends on who you're with, but my particular fwb wasn't at all invested in making things awesome for both of us, only him...Thank god I come easily.  He also seemed to think I was at risk of falling in love with him at any given time, so he went to a lot of effort to talk about his ex-girlfriend.  Seriously man, I just want to get laid, I don't need to write a book on your ex.  That's not what I'm here for.  I have no idea what the hell he was worried about, I don't know a damn thing about him save for what he studied at school and the stuff he told me about Dana.  




 Obsessively read about this forthcoming thing.  Like the Jawbone UP3... I pre-ordered the damn thing back in November.  I googled it daily.  :( for those in the know.   




 The Late Night Grumbler is right... the last time I saw this, I threw it in reverse for thirst.  




 I just want to put this out there: I'm almost 30, and I'm more intelligent than my mother, but I'm still not willing to best her in any way, shape, or form, because she was so successful in ingraining me with respect.  There have been things that she has said to me that I know in my heart aren't true, but I still grapple with because she was the one who said them.  I truly believe that your parents are the closest thing to a God you will find on this earth.  

I absolutely think at my age I should be held accountable... but prior to 23 when your brain is done maturing?  I'm not so sure about that.    




 100%.  Being a man in a man's world would be amazing.  I have a whole list of things I would do.   




 And where were you when I was 21?!?! 




 It was actually because her husband had very bad insomnia and had to get up at 4:00am.  It didn't really bother me, I still had a choice in the matter, you know?  It just tried my ingenuity from time to time. ;) 




 Two songs:

[Fred Jones Part II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJDaKDpva2c) by Ben Folds Five

[It's a Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJNB8fXje3I)  by Neil Young

For the same reason, they're about how we're all shuttling on towards irrelevancy/death.   




 When I graduated from high school, I immediately moved out of state.  I came back two years later and lived at home for the summer before I started college and lived on campus.  During that summer, my mom had a rule that I needed to be in by 10pm or out until after 4am.  All my friends would go to sleep by bar close, so I spent a lot of time sleeping in the back seat of my car in the driveway or going to the casino or walking around Wal-Mart.  




 Man, this only applies to those of you not struggling with an existential crisis.  I WISH it was a matter of putting out or making food, that would make life very easy.    




 GREAT QUESTION.  My favorite dead word is "Ready-Made."  These days, it is much more common to smoke a "ready-made" cigarette than it is to roll your own, so no one points out that what they're offering is a ready-made, that would be redundant!   




 While you might be right technically, your contribution assumes that you want these rights.  As a married person, I can tell you that the tax differential is negligible at best.  You just need to do your paperwork.  If you have a Will and a DNR worked up, you don't need a marriage to ensure your SO is taken care of or has a say in when to pull the plug.  As for parenthood, I'm 100% sure you can find more women who want to have babies than you can men.    




 I'm totally confused by this question.  Like, not to be a smartass, but there is no logical reason for a non-religious man to marry in these United States.  The way I see it, it is the men who want to get married that are in demand, not the other way around.  Sex in the City confirms this suspicion.  

Confession: If I had a penis, I'd never even date exclusively.  What would be the point?  




 Nothing that can help your girlfriend, just things to help potential victims.  Post on your local Craigslist about what happened, put out a PSA on your Facebook, that kind of thing.  A lot of the people who are responding to this don't have a lot of money so they are desperate to believe they can live in a nice home with low rent.  The game is to steal identities, not money.   




 I had this total asshole of a boyfriend in my younger years who wore a specific cologne.  

Our new training assistant wears the same one.  I have to make a conscious effort stop myself from being short and rude with him.  I never talk to him for more than two minutes if I can avoid it.    




 I have a bit of experience with this kind of thing, and I have to tell you that in all likelihood, this person isn't based out of the US, you would probably be wasting your money.  The guy I was dealing with was working out of Nigeria.  This is the 2015 version of those e-mails we used to get in 2003. 




 Ryan Adams.  Even when he's being a total dick for no reason, there is a hilarious wit in his way of insulting people.  This morning I laughed until I cried reading what he had to say about Jack White's role in Cold Mountain.   




 Well, I've heard it said that your same-sex parent will set you straight and hold you accountable, while your opposite-sex parent will believe you can do anything and that you're the greatest thing ever.

I would imagine if I'd had a father (not my father, he was an addict and died when I was 12, but you know, a normal one) I wouldn't constantly be grappling with the self-doubt I got from my mom always telling me I'm wrong or that I'm confused or that I'm bringing things on myself.  I'm grateful she did, because I'm very successful and I have a strong sense of right and wrong, but I wonder what I would have been like if it had been tempered with a little of that blind faith that I'm amazing.  




 Well, the tallest thing was this derelict ski jump.  That thing was so tall when you looked down, you couldn't make out the faces of the people on the ground.  It also swayed in the wind and was cold as fuck up there.

The craziest thing isn't so crazy if someone hadn't seen us and called the 5-0, so we had to hide up there for the better part of an hour, lying down, trying not to giggle.  We used one of those round cement smoking waste things to climb up a lower overhang on a hockey shelter and from there managed to get up on the roof.  




 Look, I know this isn't anything special or original or really anything else, but any time someone sarcastically or seriously posts "You're the hero reddit needs" or "You're the hero reddit deserves," I usually start crying for laughing so hard.  I've upvoted that damn movie reverence all 23 times I've come across it.  




 I had to tell my 17 year old cousin that his mother had committed suicide over the phone.  He reacted with shock, saying something to the effect of "Nuh-uh...."  He went quiet for a bit and then asked me how it had happened.  

You just don't know how you're going to react.  I had spent almost a day trying to find his contact information, I found it and made the phone call and the moment he answered, I started shaking uncontrollably.    




 Heck yeah, get up and GO!  If I were a man, that's exactly what I'd be doing!  The truth is that you're a smart and talented individual who has drive and self-confidence.  When that is who you are, you will always land on your feet.  On you deathbed, I highly doubt you'll look back and say to yourself "Man I'm glad I never followed through on traveling more."  Go out and have fun for the both of us! :) 




 Don't panic!  You're troubles are probably 100% related to nerves.  Think about it like those couples who can't have babies.  They go to the doctor thinking there is something seriously wrong with them, but the truth is that they're both fine.  They just want to have a child so badly that their bodies are resisting due to stress.  It's probably just the same here.

You said you needed advice on what to do and what to say.  Here's what to do: practice being present.  Tonight in your room try meditating.  Sit down, close your eyes, focus on relaxing your whole body starting with your feet and moving up.  Tune out everything, all your thoughts, all the noise in your house, just feel what it is like to be in your body.  Notice everything, but focus and think about nothing.  I'm sure you've been having racing thoughts while you're with your girlfriend, the point is to practice in a low pressure place how to be in the moment.

Here's what to say: She's probably going to be hurt no matter what you say to her.  Go to the extra effort to tell her how sexy you find her and if she wants to talk about your troubles, I'd try to make it out that you're just so worried that something will go wrong you're sabotaging yourself.  

Good luck, I hope things work out better for you... just try not to worry, okay?  I'm sure there is nothing wrong with you.   
























 I don't agree. I was curious when I read about your screwdriver mishap, and so I clicked through your username. You seem like an amazing, funny, generous, resilient person. Your husband is lucky to have you.  




 Of course not.  Her hands were at her side...  




 I'm going to say something crazy.  I gave birth 100% naturally, and let me tell you, there are a lot of things your body does to you that makes it not any where near as bad as they tell you.  I got a second degree tear pushing, and while I felt the blood from it when my skin broke, I didn't feel any actual pain.  Too many endorphins. 

Granted, actually getting to the point you can push is pretty awful...

But none of it was as bad as the pain I had when I got swimmer's ear at 12.  THAT was the worst pain I've ever had.  I wanted to claw my way out of my body.  




 Hold up guys, you're jumping the gun.  A potential start date is a normal interview question.  It has to do with whether you're a conscientious employee who is going to give notice to your current employer.  If you're actually going to get the job at your level (an engineer), they're going to present you with an offer letter.  That letter is going to tell you your salary.  Benefits are not something you'll get FULL details on until you're an employee because it is proprietary.  What they will tell you is what they offer in general terms (medical, HSA, life, dental) they may disclose if it is a high deductible, but they don't have to.   




 Site your sources, please.

Edit: I'm being serious, I'm Googling in vain trying to find people who have hurt themselves because they AREN'T trying to be hygienic about their periods.  Plenty of improper use, but nothing here about letting it soak into your clothes being dangerous.  I've never heard of this being an issue in a third world country, I'm very sincerely curious.   




 Well, provided you actually still get your period (many active women do not, and if you aren't eating properly, your body will shut it down), you could use a menstrual cup.  Really, though, we're talking about being in a trench with the intent of killing other people.  You're going to get dirty.  It's not like your period is an illness.  You're just dirty in a different way.  It's a non-issue.  




 Well, so far we've had Susan B. Anthony and Sacagawea minted on dollar coins.  Neither would have been my first choice.  I'd like to see Madeline Albright or Condoleezza (I've retired from politics to teach) Rice on a bill, but I know that will never happen. 




 Well, since my daughter was born, I don't save anything.  I've been trying, but it's just not very likely.  In order to save to my actual savings, I would need to decrease my contribution to my Roth 401k, and it's important to put in as much as  you can as early as you can, so I think that's the priority.  After my bills and my deduction for retirement (About $2000, which is mostly essential things like $220 a paycheck for health insurance, $200 a week for daycare), my take home is about $500, which I must take my phone bill, fuel for my car, and student loans out of.  This leaves me with roughly $100 a week in "mad money." I save little if any of it.   




 I've tried something like six times now to make it through the last season of Nip/Tuck.  Finally I just read the damn Wikipedia article, pictured it in my head, and left it at that.  I think one season into the move to L.A. it was sort of watchable, but enter Hearts and Scalpels, and all of a sudden it was literally painful to watch.  I don't know if there was some unhappiness but a long network contract or what the deal was.

 lol, I'm a girl!!!! It was a reference to this: http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/19/us/gingrich-s-piggies-poked.html 




 Please see my edit.  




 I'm not a he.  It was a reference to this: http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/19/us/gingrich-s-piggies-poked.html

 Women can't participate in trench warfare because they will die from a yeast infection if they get too dirty.

 Pros


-Won't be as prone to run away from home

-Won't bleed on your furniture

-Can't have unexpected puppies

-Won't die from complications of birth (lots of dogs, like English Bulldogs, need assistance up to and including surgery to give birth to a litter)

-Stabilized mood

Cons


-Can be expensive if you don't qualify for financial assistance

Edit: formatting and typo fix 




 The poncho is a staple of failed fashions to be reintroduced every five years.  Check out your local consignment shop (Goodwill, Savers) you can probably find an array of ponchos from as recently as the year 2007. 




 African Americans are 13.2% of the US Population, and yet make up 60% of the total prison population.  




 Are you really trying to tell me that when Will Parish gets all choked up describing what his wife was wearing the first time he met her your stone cold heart doesn't break just a little? I don't believe it. I bet you blubber like a baby. It's okay, man, me too.  




 For real, though. There are two scenes in this movie that make me cry every single time. I got the VHS set for Easter when I was, like, 14. Great choice, man!  




 Right, the point was about accepting personal responsibility. Yes, sometimes things happen to use that we wouldn't choose, but what we can choose is how to overcome. :) 




 1) I expect nothing.

2) Haven't you ever seen those posts on Facebook where they show like a turn key for opening a can of sardines with text like "Like if you know what this is... Don't give it away!"

3) You know what I'm sick of?  Older people telling me about how unfortunate I am to not know what it is to have spent my childhood outside or to be unwired.  Hello, I didn't have a cellphone until I was 21, and we were outside all the time.  My SNES had a strict half hour a day limit on it.  It's called parenting.  By the same ticket, it's not "impressive" that I listen to talk radio or like Led Zeppelin.

4) What even IS a 90's kid?  I was born in 1987, and I'm the first to admit that anything prior to 1995 is a bit blurry.  I found out who Nirvana was at 15.5 years old.  Yet I'm told people born in '98 consider themselves to be 90's kids?  Call me crazy, but I think you should probably have to remember the actual decade to associate with it.  Like my husband.  Graduated HS in 1994.  THAT'S a 90's kid.  




 This isn't a city, but I was SHOCKED at how beautiful Nebraska was... I mean, I had always heard it was so boring, the most boring state there is, even... look, Iowa and Indiana both have much worse landscapes... Gentle hills covered in tall grass that moves in the wind is quite beautiful! You know what isn't?  Acres of soybeans.  And in Indiana?  Even the billboards are boring.  




 It's okay, man.  My disclosure is currently sitting at 0 points.  This is precisely what I'm talking about in my response.  We shouldn't have to gird our loins because more often than not people choose to be vindictive.   




 Senpai just noticed me, ladies.  Check that off the bucket list.  

My daughter had a lip and a tongue tie.  We had the tongue tie corrected when she was two weeks old, but the lip tie was too minor to do anything about.  She was making me bleed and I ended up getting mastitis twice.  I spent very close to a grand on lactation counseling before I ended up just exclusively pumping for two months.  I got mastitis again, and finally when I got Reynauld's syndrome from pumping for about six hours a day, I had to admit I was missing the forest for the trees and needed to accept it was over.  I needed to dry up, realize that she wasn't going to starve because she was on formula, and give all this time back to her.  It was still really hard and I still want to cry talking about it.  




 This seems to have turned into an "unattractive generalization about my gender" type of thread.  My answer to the actual question is that I let my daughter sleep on her stomach and I failed at breastfeeding before we even hit three months.  

To join the party: I've experienced more sexism and misogyny from other women than I ever have from men.  If you are a smart and capable, dependable type of person, I will do everything in my power to pull you up and beyond my level.  Pulling people down doesn't do anything but hurt your soul.  Stop doing that!  




 This sounds exactly like something me and my sister would think up playing with our Barbies.  It's not a good Barbie game without a serial killer involved.  Sounds like this kid took it one step further.  I approve.  Future novelist.  




 There is no such thing as divine retribution.  Good things don't exclusively happen to good people, and bad people might never get their comeuppance.  

To expound on that idea, once people get over it, you're only a victim if you allow yourself to see it that way.  You are the only person who is uniquely in charge of your own destiny.  If you hate the way things are, you can change your entire reality.  You really are the only thing that is holding you back.  




 It's getting better.  That bullshit about getting pre-qualified for 4.25 times my annual wages would never happen post-bank reform.  We're seeing the beginning of college tuition reform.  As someone who is getting old enough to think about the younger generation, I'm actually optimistic.  For while the way they go about things isn't always what I would do, I sure as heck wasn't fighting against inequality at age 12.  Young people are more conscientious, civil rights minded, and generous than I think they've ever been.  I am also seeing a shifting of values insofar as life-goals, which are more aligned with the reality of inflation and the wage-gap.  Marriage and homeownership are being replaced with travel and experiences.  While that isn't what I've chosen for myself, it's certainly more cost effective and probably more satisfying for people who don't want to look back and have regrets. 

Sorry about how sentimental this reply was.  




 Ignore the "7 second rule" on the freeway.  The theory prevents tailgating.  For every 10 mph you're traveling, you should have 1 second between you and the next car.  You count them by waiting for them to pass a traffic light or sign and then count aloud.   




 This isn't really all that creepy, but I did shoot a soda out of my nose when she asked me this at age 9: "What's the difference between menstruation and masturbation?  Because I can't really tell the difference."  Clearly, this is what happens when you are desperate to seem more knowledgeable than you are.    




 Well, another thing to look for is something that your dad uses everyday, but would never spend a lot of money on for himself... like a coffee maker.  If he loves coffee, but bought the $20 Mr. Coffee model from Wal-Mart, replace it for him.  What kind of razors does he use?  Does he use $.99 Shampoo?  Scott toilet paper?!  Just give him a nice version, and make a joke about it.  Royal treatment on me, dad. :) 




 Technically, I have already obtained my version of the American dream.  I have a career, I'm a homeowner, I'm married, and I have a child that I'm able to support without financial aid of any sort.  Despite my considerable amount of financial responsibility, I'm still able to put 12% of my wages into my retirement fund, and if I retire at 65, I'll have enough to live comfortably until I'm 90.  I'm not yet 30 years old.  I'm also making enough money to pay my mother a high enough wage to enable her to stay at home with my baby.

I think my success where a lot of millennials are coming up short has to do with proper financial education, which I'm sorry to say did not come from high school or college, but from my mother.  The danger in my mind is over-extending yourself.  

The first time I went in and got pre-qualified for a homeowner's loan, my husband and I were making a total of $40k a year.  We were approved for $170k.  Right now we're a $75k per year family with a $70k mortgage, which isn't even as much as I was pre-qualified for on my wages alone (pre-qualified for $95k).

I was also advised from the time I was 16 that I need to contribute to my retirement as soon and as much as I can, as you need time for your money to compound.  Later, I had a retired family member tell me how much he regretted putting most of his money in a traditional 401k instead of in a Roth account.  I immediately took his lament to heart. 

I got my first credit card at 16 so I could begin building my credit.  I've got a score of over 800.

I've never paid a car payment in my life, since a car is only worth getting you from point A to point B... it will never be a lasting investment.  Better to just shell out for that junker, run it dead, then move on to the next one.

tl;dr: I think it depends on how much common sense parents are able to instill in their children.  It's possible to have everything you want and more if you know early on what it takes to hit your aims.    




 Although, I have to say, his sister is a class act too.  My Great grandfather was an amazing wood worker, and he made these lovely matching boxes as his and his wife's final resting place (they both wanted to be cremated).  Debbie took their ashes out and had them converted to JEWLERY BOXES.  My great grandparents are currently in ziplock bags at the child molester's house. :-/ 




 My great uncle.  He's a child molester.  He's assaulted my mother (she was 12), raped my aunt (she was 15), and one of his daughters suffered from urinary incontinence until her 20's while the other just completely shut down at age five and didn't speak again until she was about 10... so I can't say for sure there, but it stands to reason.     




 You should try to think of a gift that is based upon an innocuous detail he mentioned at some point.  

I remember once when I was 20, I came in to visit my grandpa wearing a pair of Chuck Taylor hi-tops.  He told me he had a pair just like them in the 1960's.  They were white and his wife had thrown them out.  Now he was in his 80's and I'd never seen him wear anything but cowboy boots, so instead of actually replacing them, I made him a photo-realistic portrait of a pair and gave it to him several years later. 

People love to feel like you're listening to them even when they don't have anything too terribly important to say.  




 Well, with 20 more characters, maybe I'd be more successful than I thought. (Just kidding! 2verbose2live) 




 He's my... uh.... 1st cousin twice removed, I think.... He back handed a toddler, Great Grandma didn't like it.  The irony is that there are a number of child molesters that Grandma never knew about that were/are about 12x more deserving of her ire.  




 I'm a big fan of https://twitter.com/katvapid

If I could be as snide, witty, and pithy as Kat in 120 characters, I'd actually have an account. :-/ 




 No man, they just [screw with Jell-O boxes.](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2013/02/20/ethel_and_julius_rosenberg_how_a_jell_o_box_helped_convict_them.html)  




 Better yet, hire Steve Buscemi to give them the $10,000, gift card, and bad news.  Then kill yourself.  In your suicide note, admit you always loved that person.  Done.  Dust hands.  




 The way I eat is the most prevalent one.  I always put off eating better.  




 Yes, and then it all falls out.  I'm not even kidding.  




 I have a whole list of childhood crushes that are not altogether conventional:

-Marty Stouffer - Wild America (like PBS, not the movie with Devon Sawa)

-Tom Petty

-David Spade

-Dana Carvey

-Norbert - The Angry Beavers (stop judging me)

-Eric from Captain Planet

-Jesus Christ (I'm an atheist who loved beards from age 2)

-Brian May (from Queen)

... I could go on into my teens, but I think this is probably enough disclosure for this particular post.  




 A nail clipper.  There has never been a moment in my life where I think, man this nail clipper is a useless waste of space.  I'm always glad for it.  




 Well, I think that's down to preference and lifestyle. I am a woman, so I don't sweat a lot, and I work in an air conditioned office. You don't want to end up with the "Fitbit rot" so if you do choose to go with a rubber band, make sure you have enough slack for air to circulate and you clean it with isopropyl once a week. I think a better option in my mind would be a NATO band. They're made out of Nylon, more secure, washable, affordable, and have classic preppy style to them in a variety of colors. :) 




 Just be smart and earn people's respect through your performance.

The point was supposed to be that we shouldn't be upset about stuff we can't change, and even if it doesn't seem that way now, people how overcome the same issues at an even greater disadvantage.  Furthermore, what you're seeing as a defect is actually an asset in the minds of many people, so cheer up!  I was trying to make him feel better about something that is probably not going to change for a long time.  But, you know, thank you for all of your valuable contributions.  




 Thank you for attempting to help me, but what I meant is that while I know full well how to use it correctly, the majority of the population does not, so rather look like I'm wrong (while they would be wrong about that), I just revise. ;) 




 Well, you can see my advice regarding how to be taken seriously above.  




 Man, try being taken seriously as a woman who has a baby face and is also under five feet tall. I got offered a kids menu printed on a damn football while out to dinner with my company's CEO while I was 27 and six months pregnant. Just be smart and earn people's respect through your performance. 

Postscript: The next day I gave a performance summary to the second in command of the largest utility company in the United States about how I single handedly turned his outsourced program around... Like a boss.  




 Why would you want to fix your baby face? It's actually a proven fact that human beings are drawn to partners who look younger than they are due to viability of genetics. Men are even more attracted to women with vaguely babyish features... Here: http://study.com/academy/lesson/physical-traits-and-attraction-symmetry-ratios-the-babyface-phenomenon.html 




 Y-you got a reservation?  But how?  Damn it, Sean!  




 Guys, c'mon.  It think it's probably something like "Next round of golf is on me," in addition to the normal picking up the tab on drinks and meals.  




 Right, hence the "most people wouldn't trouble," I was making room for extreme pragmatists who use it as a means for manipulating situations by being highly aware of different aspects.  




 Well, probably because most people wouldn't trouble to imagine what it is like to be someone else and go through an event as that person if the experience didn't inspire some sort of emotional response in them.  When I'm empathizing, I also tend to communicate in a way that makes the person feel less alone while not being sympathetic (read: pitying them).

Edit: word 




 This is also my husband's birthday month.  I got him a ticket to see two symphonies by two of his favorite composers.  I also got him the complete Polar Bear Caf anime series since that kind of absurd humor would appeal to him and it's kid friendly.  Note: My husband is not my dad.  




 Well for one thing, my condescending old relatives wouldn't be able to post that transcript of his stupid graduation speech on Facebook once a week.  Guess what, not all of us take our parents for granted or think they're moronic and boring...   




 We all have preferences, and that's all they are: preferences.  Things don't become problematic until we're trying to force people into an ideal against their will.

Personally, I don't really find moderately overweight men or muscular men attractive.  My ideal is someone who lists slightly to the left in a strong wind (read: skinny af), however I happen to be married to someone who is perfectly average if a bit tall.  It's not a deal breaker and I'm not going to starve him to make him more attractive.  




 /u/late_night_grumbler He makes me laugh. 

Edit: I also really enjoy these thoughtful and intelligent ladies: /u/hugsouffle and /u/unsweet_tea 




 This is a great, well thought out comment.  Thank you for taking the type to write it out.  This is just what I was looking for. :) 




 Please don't post jokes about how you also only start half the time. I'm seriously curious about where the new-car mentality comes from.  




 It would, but not in the way you think it would.  This person would clearly need to be able to kill things with their mind.  The government would waste no time in kidnapping this person and then turning them into a wartime weapon!  The corpses resultant would nourish the earth.  The end.  




 Well, my sister had absolutely terrible taste in music.  She would listen to Good Charlotte, Ashlee Simpson, Trapt, Blue October, New Found Glory, Howie Day... I absolutely hated it then, and some of it I still do... but occasionally some idiotic song will come on and I'll like it in spite of myself because it reminds me of her.  This is the inverse of what you're asking.  




 No problem, man.  I'll mention too that at my old place they mandated the amount of notice you had to give based upon your pay schedule e.g. if you are salaried, you must give one month; if you are hourly, you must give two weeks.  




 You just gave me an eye twitch.  




 /r/advice But, hell, why not.  There is usually a difference between sick leave and vacation.  Some places don't differentiate and just call it PTO or Paid Time off.  You need to check your employer's policies.  There is usually a clause stating that you need to give notice IN WRITING and that you need to work all of the days in notice (unless the employer dismisses you) to be paid out for your vacation.   




 Well-groomed, charming, conventionally attractive guys.  If you use hair-gel and can charm strangers, I'm going to assume you have a great game and could possibly be carrying an STI.  I'm not about that life.  




 Sounds to me like you have a problem with being present.  Obviously we all need to think about the past or present on occasion, but the aim is to visit, not reside.  Instead of thinking about all the things you need to do next, focus on what you're doing now.  Try to enjoy it.  Your memory will improve.   




 I'd advise against taking this person's comment seriously. :-/ 




 This one is so prevalent that I actually re-write my sentences to not include them so that the majority will not assume I'm wrong for using "affect" more than not.  Yes, I have anxiety and worry about things like this.  




 Yeah.  In my high school there was only one Hispanic kid in the whole building.  I don't think I ever heard anyone call him by his real name.  It was always "beaner" or "wetback" or "brownie" or "spic..."  Now having moved to this area from a predominantly Hispanic community a state away, I was totally shocked and ask why the hell you would do something like that.  The response I always heard from the other kids was "He doesn't care, he knows we're not serious."   




 No, however my husband's first name is a common shortening of my own name.  You will not believe the moronic questions we get about it.  You would think we lived in the Good Burger sketch with the twins.  




 Real Talk: I'm sure the kid would come out with just as many issues, they would merely be different issues.  On paper, I have a much better life than my mom and those advantages would pertain to my child, however, circumstances aren't everything.  My mother never struggled with crippling anxiety.  She's a pretty happy person, if a bit insensitive to things she doesn't understand.      




 I don't know the names of any tracks, but my husband plays this bizarre atmospheric music that is pretty much a foghorn playing for 24 minutes and occasionally there will be this high pitched beeping that he can't even hear... Protip: if your dogs whimper because of the beeping in your music, it's no good.  Turn it off!  




 I totally get what you're saying, but you know, a "I'm sorry, I missed that..." would go a long way.  It's totally not fun to feel beneath notice. 




 YES!  My husband fucking tells his mother everything, then remembers it as telling me... Like MAN if you had TOLD ME that we were having company, I'd be nervous and thus I would remember you telling me.  Do not tell me you told me.  You told your damn mother again!  Of course what I really say is "I would appreciate it if you could try telling me a few times :)" 




 Three times a day or so, I will say something to my husband and he will act like he didn't hear me.  Like he'll be obviously looking for something, and I'll say to him "What are you looking for, baby?" and he'll just not answer, not look at me, and then leave the room on a search for something that is probably exactly where I think it is.   He also does this when I ask him to turn down the volume in the car.  I swear to god, I am NOT a mumbler.  He's just being an ass.  




 Older doesn't mean smarter or more driven or really more anything.  I absolutely hate that your age doesn't actually equate to brilliance.  I think this would be a lot easier for me if I had seen it in action prior to age 22.  Like, so let me get this straight... you're 57 and you're working for $7.50 at a call center and this is your whole life?  I don't understand.  You're bumming me out. 




 Probably making sandwiches for my husband.  I like to add all kinds of things that if I told him about he probably wouldn't try the sandwich... so when he inevitably tells me it's the best sandwich he's ever had I'm like :3  




 I was riding with my mom in the car in winter and there was salt on the roads.  She said "It pisses me off that the Indians use all this salt... aren't they supposed to care about the environment?"

I sat there for like two minutes before I managed to say "Mom, for 150 years white people forced them into boarding schools where they erased all traces of their culture.  That's more than one generation.  What are you even talking about?"  She didn't believe me then, but like two years later I proved to her that assimilation is a thing and it happened.  She tells everyone now.  




 I actually prefer them.  I left the following comment on some other post: 

Be awkward and malnourished. I don't have a type per say, unless emaciated is a type. I like 'em hungry looking. 
 




 If you're going vintage, you want to look for something that has been serviced and cleaned and checked for accuracy.  If you're using eBay (which is a great way to find watches), you should check the finished sales on watches with the same movement.  

There are typically three kinds of watches people are looking for: Quartz (meaning battery powered), manual (you wind it), or automatic (it winds itself through the movement of your arms when you walk).  If you're looking for a low profile, you will probably have to sacrifice the convenience of the self-winding automatic.

It's better to go vintage than it is to buy a brand new watch that's a cheap piece of junk... like a Stuhrling.  Yes, it's pretty, but you won't have it long.   

If you really have a timepiece you love, invest in some watch tools so you can change your bands on it.  Get a nice band or a few.  I have a BROS buffalo leather band on my vintage Zenith, and I love it! :) 




 Yes, there are people in the world that have it worse than you, but that doesn't make what you're feeling less real.  It doesn't negate your feelings.

I recently had someone point out that I was being unfair in a discussion because I was failing to acknowledge the validity of one group's plight because the plight of the other group was so much greater.  That was not fair of me and far from sensitive.  I never do this on an individual level, but when it comes to groups and broad generalizations, I have a much harder time.  




 "When you call me close to tell me your body is not beautiful I want my body and my hands to be pools for your looking and laughing. 




 It used to be cerulean, and that's still the answer I'll give automatically, but I think that it's not strictly true.  Colors benefit greatly by having other colors around them.  It's like one of those t-shirt displays at a shop.  You buy one and take it home but it never looks as nice as it did with all its fellows.  




 According to my body-builder friend, you can live healthily a very long time on broccoli and flax-crusted chicken breasts.  I asked him the same question.  




 Where they keep the snoovatars and you get gilded for reasons that are hard to pinpoint... you know... that place.  




 You know... the image-less image board everyone uses....  




 Miracle, kismet, zeitgeist, caveat....  




 Calm down, I'm just remarking surprise since I would have expected you to say something like "I'd be the person who comes to your house and breaks your arms for asking the same question I saw five times yesterday alone."

I'm old, married, and, yes, I have bad taste.  You don't need to tell me you have no interest.  I'm just trying to have fun with you. :( 




 Tumblr's favorite topic is extremely subjective.  It all depends on who you are following.  I could ask the same question but it would look like this: "Why are child-free people who abuse children tumblr's favorite topic?"  or like this: "Why are the politics of black hair tumblr's favorite topic?" 




 You've bothered to give this answer multiple times, you who hates repeat questions.... it's strange.  I have no idea what you look like, but I'm pretty sure no matter how you look, I'd prefer you over Ryan Reynolds.  He gives me the creeps.  




 Was it a LATE NIGHT, Grumbler???? AHAHAHAHAH T_T 




 I'll take it! ;) 




 Omg, you guys.  He's talking about me!  




 Cersei Lannister.... We never got a single clue prior to her narration chapters that she was practically a paranoid schizophrenic whose mania was fixated on Tyrion.  I always got the impression that she didn't like him, but I never thought for one second she was AFRAID of him and imagining him hiding behind every corner.... What the hell?

Edit: Maybe we find out later that someone is poisoning her and she's actually going insane and that's why this was never foreshadowed?   




 Cheap prescription glasses... I'm looking at you, [Zenni Optical](http://www.zennioptical.com/).  Thank you for saving me hundreds vs. Lenscrafters.  




 Two books: 

Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro

The Reader by Bernhard Schlink  




 Kicker: It's actually spelled "lemin."  Yes really. 
























 I want to be clear that this isn't an absolute to me.  I don't believe in "I don't believe it, so it can't be true."

That said, it was a combination of two things.  In first grade I was very into Greek and Norse mythology.  People used to believe these over-the-top stories.  Now they believe new ones... it just made sense to me that in the natural progression, people would believe something else someday.  This was in addition to seeing a diagram of the various systems inside the human body.  I saw that it was a machine that was self-sufficient.  The soul was totally unnecessary and had no place in it.  And so at 7 I stopped feeling god was true.  I couldn't undo that feeling.     




 Oh no.  It freaked me out, because it was indicative of how far he would go to avoid things he didn't want to do, but I made him an appointment with the optometrist.  It was really cute to watch him stare at things for a month after.  I think he'd forgotten what leaves looked like.  




 If that is something people really believe, they should take a look at the number of African American males drafted during the Vietnam War.  The draft is in no way impartial.  




 I apologize, I didn't Google the statistic, that was just what I'd heard back in high school.  I'll edit it.  




 That is actually a great point and something to think about.  I believe that it just hasn't been on anyone's radar.  Apparently in the 1980's a plan was made to have skill-specific drafts for Health Care personnel that would include women, but the plans were never acted upon.  It's interesting, but I think the draft just isn't a priority in light of all the other pressing issues we have at the moment.     




 but it is a necessary evil to exist. 

Source please.  In the context of the United States today, there is no reason whatsoever for the draft to exist.  My views are not "convenient," they are what I believe.  I'm sorry if that doesn't fall in line with the box you're trying to shove me into.   




 If you're interested in my opinions on specific events in history, please PM me and I'd be happy to discuss.  My opinions on the use and execution of the US draft vary by conflict and aren't relevant to this thread. 
Edit: grammar 




 Is this a serious question?  We haven't used the draft since the Vietnam War... we've participated in 15 military conflicts since then.  Through voluntary enlistment, obviously.  




 Sorry for double replying, but I had some more things I wanted to talk about here, upon thinking about it.

I think that we don't make the draft a priority because at this point in time, it's a non-issue.  You register, but can you even imagine how the nation would have reacted if they had drafted for the controversial war in Iraq?  It would have been pandemonium.  You have to prioritize here.  You register for the draft, you get a free razor, you'll never be called into action because the times have changed.

My main focus on civil rights actually has nothing to do with feminism.  It's to do with educating the people in my area about assimilation of Native Americans.  I live on the edge of a reservation and the amount of racism is unbelievable.  

If you asked me to give my complete agenda as a feminist, it would merely be that I want white men to speak out when they see things that are unfair, even if it is going to be unpopular.  This isn't unique to feminism, but to that casual homophobic remark that is made among friends, or that racist joke someone made that you don't agree with.  Instead of laughing along, I'd like to see white men recognize that they have the responsibility of setting the expectation for what is acceptable and what is not and use that power for good.  This doesn't seem crazy to me.  




 I like things that are uncommon or unique.  I like it when a guy is wearing a vintage bowling shirt or gas station work shirt with the wrong name on it.  I like guys who recognize baggy corduroy pants are mega comfortable.  I like it when they dress according to what size they actually are, rather than going with XXL at 140 lbs soaking wet.  Just preferences, not deal breakers.  My husband is actually one of those people who wears the same thing everyday just in different color variants.      




 If I saw a protest against the draft in my area, I would 100% be there.  I posted an article as a response to one of the above questions.  Many mens issues are actually covered under feminism.  My heart breaks for men who have been sexually assaulted and feel they cannot get help.  I find the fact that men are nearly ~~twice~~ four times as likely to commit suicide to also be a very real issue.  Now, I'm not a super active activist.  I work full-time, I have a 8 month old daughter, and I spend 6 hours every weekend volunteering with a hospice, but I do what I can.   




 You're taking issue with the wrong thing.  There are about 25 good reasons to abolish the draft.  It's a broken system and one we're never going to return to.  On the off chance you actually care about educating yourself on the real issue, here is [this.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/10/16/america-may-never-have-a-draft-again-but-were-still-punishing-low-income-men-for-not-registering/) 




 I call it "my downstairs mixer," which I do to amuse myself.  It's a bastardization of the phrase "Downstairs Mix-up" as coined by Old Gregg in the Mighty Boosh.   




 Probably at the point it came to my attention that he couldn't see clearly even fifteen feet away.  He'd had glasses a decade ago, accidently sat on them, and had such bad anxiety he couldn't bring himself to make an appointment and get them replaced.  I felt totally overwhelmed in that moment.  




 I'm not sure why you downvoted me.  Clearly you don't actually care about responses, merely about making a statement disguised as a question.  




 As a feminist, I find the existence of the draft to be unfortunate.  I don't think it should exist at all.  




 Giving birth. I gave birth 100% naturally, and let me tell you, there are a lot of things your body does to you that makes it not any where near as bad as they tell you. I got a second degree tear pushing, and while I felt the blood from it when my skin broke, I didn't feel any actual pain. Too many endorphins. 

Granted, actually getting to the point you can push is pretty awful...
 




 Because what you're talking about is found at /r/unorthodog !

Both my dogs belong there.  ;) 




 Do yourself a favor and watch "Let me In."

It's time to take a break from that Uncle Buck, Problem Child bullshit you're clearly inundated with.  




 Try this instead: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2oijc5/girls_of_reddit_when_the_guys_arent_around_what/cmnfnr3?context=3

I should start a "Best of late_night_grumbler" subreddit.  




 That's very strange... you gel with "I feel so lucky you wanna hug me... what rhymes with hug me?"  That's not very pithy imo. 




 Really?  I thought that was hilarious!  He said "witch hunt" in the context of Harry Potter.  I'm laughing as I type this!  

P.S. I hope you didn't just down-vote me because you didn't get it... You'll prove him right!  




 I would be very, very careful, and ask in a subreddit that isn't this one, since you're probably just going to get some very dangerous suggestions.  Good luck!  




 Well, I'm not really sure what you're driving at, but my sister lost 20 lbs. by walking 20,000 steps a day and eating oatmeal with unsweetened applesauce two meals a day.  She said it put her at something like a 1,000 calorie deficit.

 Danielle, is that you? 




 I have two:

"In my head there's only you now, and this world falls on me.  In this world is real and make believe, but this seems real to me."

"You feel the tugging of the world, so soft and slow, turning you round and round." 









 This isn't what you're asking, but I've got a good story for you...

I used to work in a call center scheduling appliance repair appointments.  I had scheduled a refrigerator repair for this elderly man.  He went with this gem : Well, Georgie, now that you've taken care of my fridge, you can take care of me with your sexy voice..."

I just about died.   




 I appreciate your support! :)  It's funny how you can never really predict what will resonate with people.  I woke up that morning to 19 replies and 1000 up votes and it was all because some ex-boyfriend tried to pass this off as fact because he'd heard a politician say it on the news once.  It was such a weird thing to think that I never forgot it.  




 Excitable Boy by Warren Zevon is pretty dark.  This just comes to mind since I'm listening to the album right now.   




 This is actually super awkward.  Mine is "Women can't participate in trench warfare because they will die from a yeast infection if they get too dirty."

I'm sure I'd spend A LOT of time explaining that I don't actually believe this and being admonished for public indecency since we shouldn't talk about vaginal infections.  




 You should absolutely take the quiz on the AKC website, but the King Charles Cavalier Spaniel is the closest thing to a one-size fits all dog.  They are well mannered, quiet, affectionate, easy to train, love children, and only require a bit of exercise.  ~~They suffer from very few medical issues as a breed.~~   
Edit: Strikeout, see comment below. 




 It would be one of those things that would force me into conversations all the time. "Well, that takes care of that."  Uh.. what exactly?  

I collect antique buttons, and one of them reads simply "Ask me what happiness is." I have no idea what this means, and I don't wear it because I don't like to talk to strangers.  Ahaha! 




 Seeking psychiatric help is not as stigmatized as it is for our male counterparts.  




 In the US, I think it would be assimilation of the native Americans.  This went on for 150 years.  The fact that my mother grew up not five miles away from a reservation but only learned about this from me at age 49 is unconscionable.    




 I know I already posted, but I wanted to give you some practical advice upon thinking about it.  The classes are all taught by individual professors, the curriculum is determined by that professor.  You may have what looks like a "freshmen level" course on your schedule that is actually a senior level class due to the person teaching it.  You are paying for your transcript.  If at all possible, talk to your upperclassmen before signing up for classes.  Try to get an idea of whether the level is accurate.  You don't want to take a super difficult class in addition to 18 credits and then pay for that bad grade just because some asshole didn't get the memo that this class is supposed to be "freshmen level."  




 If you really had your heart pinned on that "Just wait until college, everything will be different" spiel they give you all through High School, please be advised there is an awful lot that is just like High School.  Bubble tests and group projects still exist and you'll spend more time reading the opinions of others than you will engaging in your own abstract thought.  




 AAA doesn't have online payments or paperless billing.  What the hell, AAA?   




 I can't speak for my generation, only me... however I will say it seems to me that my husband's generation (he's 39) has a taste for irony or "pretend liking."  They're a very sardonic lot.  It strikes me as rather self-conscious and joyless.  




 It's to connotate that you are incredulous.  It should always be the question mark first.  You're asking a question... with spirit!  Try rewording that sentence to reflect the opposite... it's not possible.  :)   




 Everything happens for the best.  Uh... What?  




 How dare I answer an opinion based question with an opinion? 




 Obviously, however, it misses the point.  Rather like Joelle.  Look, it's Joel or Noel or Elle or Joann, let's not be crazy here.  I'm saying this as a person with a superfluous letter in her 9 character, four syllable name.  




 Katie is supposed to be a shortened version of Katherine, right?  So what is up with "Kade" and "Katy?"

I'm also not very impressed with how there are about four different ways to spell "Brit-knee..."  I don't really want to have to think this hard to take down a common name.  




 If that is what you think, you need to try the Reese Stix with coffee... holy smacks, guys, it's life changing.  




 As a salaried employee who was under a lot of pressure, working the 56 hour weeks while pregnant was very hard.  I didn't feel well, I was over-worked, and I was hormonal.  I spent a lot of time having to close my blinds to my office, ugly cry for ten minutes, then pretend like it never happened.   




 Sounds good to me! :) 




 Absolutely, that would be just fine.  I just don't want to have to deal with using a wet brush, it seems unsanitary.  If I could apply wet and have it become dry without having to use a sponge or brush, that would be great.  I really like a chunky pencil eyeshadow too.  Those are very convenient.

A moisturizing stain would be great.  I have a dual one that is a clear balm on the other end, and that works very well. :) 




 I hate bananas.  Looking at them makes me want to cry.  I hate the smell, I can't touch them.  I don't know if I was raped with a banana at three or what, but goddamn it, I don't want them in my house.  Go away, banana.  




 Thanks for giving me the chance to complain about this.  I just had the asshole who runs mortgage come in here.  He's super bossy.  Like "Call Steve." Instead of "Can you call Steve?"  He also treats my time like it means nothing, having said he'd come up to see me now and then not showing up for 30 minutes.  We have e-mail for a reason if you're on the phone, man.  But then he has the audacity to run a damn guilt trip on me as he's leaving because I'm not super friendly with him "Hope that wasn't too awful for you...."  It was, thanks.  Get out.   




 To whoever downvoted me, I hope you realize how ridiculous it is that the John Mayer song is now above Neil Young.  You should be ashamed of yourself.  




 Highly pigmented eye shadow that doesn't have fall out.  I don't like that my stupid Urban Decay Naked 3 palette is a best selling $54 purchase, but has to be used wet to actually be visible.  I also have to use Vaseline under my eyes to wipe away the fall out using it dry.

Eye liner that starts smudgeable, but becomes permanent, like the 24/7 by Urban Decay.  

Lipstains vs. Lipsticks, I've never come across a lipstick that didn't leave my lips flaky the next day. 

The Candlelight powder by Too Faced is one of my all-time favorite purchases.  I use that instead of a foundation as I don't have blemishes.

 Bitch please, I always know where I want to eat.  If my indecisive husband didn't turn down all my ideas, we'd be in business.  Indecisiveness has nothing to do with gender, it's to do with being weak-willed.

 If "Bat Outta Hell" is your cuppa, you'll love "For Crying Outloud." I mean, there isn't an overblown resurrection scene, but it is completely over the top.  I like to sing BoH to my baby.  This is, at best, irresponsible parenting, and at worst, child abuse.  




 Right.  I simply can't relate.  Why won't you let me love you?

 Look out, guys, I'm going to say something controversial.  

When I was a kid, Iowa's state sign read "Iowa, you make me smile!"  They changed it a few years back to "Fields of Opportunity."

It should read "Fields of opportunity for seventh generation Germans."

Ahaha! Seriously though, don't you move to small town Iowa and expect people to accept you. They wave, but they don't actually want you to say "Hello!"  




 Well, it's been awhile, but I know we never used style guides in high school.  You should just see what happens if you use a comma where you would naturally pause in a sentence as a guideline in your college papers.  




 Abra.  I try to interact with him, he fails to respond in any way, and then POOF! He's not there.  




 I'm pragmatic enough to have tried. She is, however, pretty stubborn. If I say that she's gotten really loud, she'll say "I know, it's intentional." Which is totally untrue. The only thing for it is to get really quiet so she has to pipe down to hear me, but try maintaining that level of unnatural manipulation for any period of time.  




 Bought myself the "expensive" mimosa and ended up getting tunnel-vision drunk on accident.  I still remember my husband saying to me over the late-night supper he bought me to sober me up "What have we done?" 




 I see what you did there, but I want her to get quieter.  This damn Stonehenge she made me is too small too, but this is the bigger issue. ;) 




 She gets really loud after about an hour.  She is seriously ignorant of the volume of her voice.  She'll start normal and crank it up to about 11.  After a day with her, I'll have been clenching my teeth so hard I have a splitting headache.  I need a nap after visiting her.  




 I haven't actually gotten very much parenting advice, but I did have someone give me some when I was 18, and I was touched by the fact that he'd bothered.

My best friend's dad was chopping up some mangoes on a wooden cutting board in the living room.  He said to me, "You can buy fruit, put it on the counter, and watch it rot as your kids walk by it or you can cut it up and serve it with dinner and watch them eat it.  You'll have kids some day, so this is my advice to you.  Take the ten minutes." 




 Looking for closure in the "Dads who abandoned their families, why/what happened?" thread.  




 Utilize the seven second rule on the freeway.  In addition to being able to guarantee I have enough time to brake completely instead of rear ending the car in front of me, I'm also not blinding them with my headlights at night.  




 Yeah, man, seriously no judgment.  I would literally trade away years of my life for a few hours with him as an adult, no matter what kind of person he was.  I still miss him.  I think about him every day.  Just do what you can.  Your son may not appreciate it now, but someday he will.  I promise.    




 Hey man.  My father died when I was 12 years old from an accidental drug-alcohol interaction.  He was a drug addict, an alcoholic, and he was violent.  I didn't know him.  I have two memories of him.  When I was two, he and my mother were screaming at each other in the living room.  I was sitting on a braided rug pleading with them to "Stop it."  The second was when I was four.  He met me and my little sister at a park for two hours.  

I have to second what Kazuke86 is saying here.  If, heaven forbid, anything should happen to you, you have to think about what that will leave your son.  I will never know my dad first hand.  I'll never know if he ever thought about me, if he loved me.  I can only guess.  It would be a huge comfort to me to have even just one little thing to remember him by.  Regardless of the things I've heard, I would still love to have been able to see him in person and to form my own conclusions and build my own memories.  He is half of who I am genetically.  I'm told that I do little things with my hands and my head like he did, but I don't know that.  By the time I was old enough to be able to choose to contact him, he was already dead.  You need to do this.  Please.  Leave him something.   




 Ours is a pretty amber color! 




 Well, semi-truck and pickup truck. I can see why it's silly, I guess. 




 I don't actually have any idea what you're talking about.  Colonel Sanders was a total caricature masterminded by Dave Thomas.  The Colonel would probably have NO PROBLEM with these commercials considering the fact that he willingly turned himself into a parody of a southern gentlemen while he was alive.  

This isn't related, but did you know that his daughter was actually married to John Wayne Gacy, the infamous rapist-serial killer?  Beyond that, he managed stores for him at one point and there are photos of him in the leisure suit.

 Well, I can't speak from a lawyer-ly standpoint, but I can tell you that the laws are different from state to state.  Here in Minnesota we are in what is called a "no-fault" divorce state.  It doesn't matter who was worse.  It takes two to tango.  If you don't have a pre-nup, don't expect damages.  




 So THAT'S where the Canadians got it from!   




 How's the weather down there?  

This is probably too specific, but the stupid change machine in our break room was very loud and every time someone used it some original person would say "Jackpot!" Finally I made this up: "If I had a quarter for every time someone said that, I wouldn't need to use this change machine!"  




 Right after my Great Grandpa passed away, my Great Grandmother told this one anecdote over and over that took place a few days before he passed.  They knew he was dying from colon cancer, and he'd been sent home to rest.  The family started arriving from out of state to say good bye.

One afternoon he was napping on the couch.  When he woke up, he was surrounded by family members.  He said to my Grandma what she thought was "That was a hell of a week," and she said "The next one will be just like it," and he corrected her "No.  I said that was a hell of a wake."

I didn't get the black humor until I was a grown-up.  




 My mom used to regularly trot these out:

"Well, you can do whatever you want, but you know how I feel."

"I know you're going to do whatever you want because you think I'm stupid."
 




 I received a speeding ticket.  I got lost approximately 50 miles out of the way on the way home from a poor-person's dentist appointment (meaning it was at night and about 150 miles from my home). 




 I'd tell them right away.  The last thing I would want is for my employer to think I'm suddenly coming to work hung-over and half asleep.  When I got pregnant, I was a salaried employee who was expected to go above and beyond.  Despite being pregnant, they made me fly cross-country five times in six months. 




 That they call the part that covers the engine of your car a bonnet.  What is that about?  Way to make a muscle car sound like a walk on in "Little House on the Prairie."  

(Yeah, this was tongue in cheek.) 




 One time I came into the kitchen of the Chinese restaurant I was working in, and there was a decaying deer hung from the ceiling.  Now, I'm not saying that I think they were serving it, I don't.  But I do think they left it in the back of a truck open for a few days because the smell was unlike anything I've ever encountered and I come from a family of hunters.  




 I only have two dream jobs: Lead singer in a Warren Zevon cover band (I'm a girl and not enough people know who that is), and Namer of Paint Samples (I don't think this is all there is to that job, but I can't find any additional information). 




 I literally have no idea what was going on in 1030.  Too lazy to Google.  I'd probably be killing a lot of rats?  Covering my hair?  Sticking a copper coin up my hoo-ha so I don't die in child birth? I don't know...   




 My least favorite is Hannibal.  Not only is it loud-quiet to the extreme, the wine filling up the face is uncannily like watching the logo bounce around on your DVD screensaver... it never finishes (hits the exact corner) no matter how many times you see it.  




 Feminism is synonymous with misandry. 




 My old apartment had a HUGE window on one wall. The neighbor would leave the porch light on all night, so I couldn't sleep well as it was bright, and my dogs would bark at things moving in the driveway. I asked my husband to turn it off after an hour (I was very pregnant usually already in bed at the point it was turned on, the dogs would wake me up), but he didn't want to offend the neighbor. One day when the light had been on all night and all of that day, I went out with a broom and very lightly tapped the lightbulb, breaking the filament in it, so it appeared to have burned out from being on all the time. The damn thing was nine feet up, so it wasn't like they were going to change it. Ahahaha!  




 This isn't HEROIC per say, but a silly thing I did for the purpose of making a delusional person happy.  

My high school boyfriend lived out in the middle of nowhere.  This did not stop his mom from being very into Halloween and talking about trick or treaters and preparing for these people she imagined would come to her house.  Now, I was with this kid for years.  The third year came and undeterred by the lack of show the last two years, his mom was ready and pumped about the trick or treaters.  I put a change of clothes behind the bar next to their back sliding glass door.  I dressed up like a boy (wrapped my midsection in a beach towel I held in place with a belt), put on gloves, and a full head mask, snuck around the back to the front door and trick or treated.  She talked about this trick or treater every year after. I never told her the truth.  




 By the same ticket, I was in total disbelief when I heard about your cream soda being a totally different color and that you sell Tylenol 3 without a prescription.   




 Would you alert the authorities? Exact vigilante justice? Do something else entirely?  




 Well, I tried to help you by digging around a bit myself, but what I'm seeing is that people who have trouble being fed aren't being studied.  I found a great article on girls in Ghana feeling pressured by the media to be thin, but it states right in the article that all girls polled are attending school and have regular access to food.  I'm sorry I don't have a good source for you, but it just stands to reason that if you have to go to considerable effort to survive, your appearance and need to exact control would be low on your list of priorities.  Hunter-gatherers have to stay busy.  




 I don't think this is really what you're driving at, but eating disorders such as bulimia and anorexia are unique to first world countries.  You will not find them in places where food is actually scarce.  It is a disease of convenience (despite being serious). 




 Useful things you never have when you need them... like a tire pressure gauge.  Or nail clippers.   




 Probably the lead singer/song writer of a death metal band.  He's going to be very disappointed when he finds out my morbid interests don't translate in any way to my appearance.  




 I don't do this, but I'm guessing that it's for the same reason they paint their lips black or dye their hair bright green... it pleases them to do so.  They like the way they look.  The assumption that women preen simply to attract partners is very silly. 




 50 Cent.  He's tough, resilient, business minded, objective, and largely considered to be nowhere near as smart as he actually is.  




 [No, his autopsy confirmed he DID have a skin disease.](http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/07/showbiz/jackson-death-trial/)  




 If you really mean my name, it would be "We don't follow her logic either..."

If you mean if I as a person were a brand name it would probably be "Only 3% joking at any time..." 
























 /u/late_night_grumbler  

He's prolific, clever, hilarious, and cranky.  He amuses me mightily.   




 Wait.... what just happened?  




 Sofia Ford Coppola.  I'd be expecting some great New Wave.  And some Radio Department.  




 [L'Eau D'Issey pour Homme](http://www.basenotes.net/ID26120927.html)... It's strange and wonderful.  Worst has to be Aqua di Gio.  Just no.  




 If you still have the booklet for the SNES game Super Mario World, it actually has an illustration that tells you.  I'm sure you can find it on google image search.  He's tall.  




 I was put on medication for hypertriglyceridemia at 21.  Because I wasn't overweight, the doctor told me it was genetic.  She also told me that because it was genetic, there was nothing I could do from a dietary standpoint to get off of my medication.

When I was 26, my body building friend told me about intermittent fasting and how you can use it to re-sensitize your body to breaking down various components and nutrients in your food.  I started doing a 20/4 schedule every day.  I quit taking my medication one month before my annual physical, and I'd gone from the 1000 level that got me on meds in the first place to a 200, which is high, but doesn't require medication!  The doctor let me go off of my meds!  




 Absolutely.  Then I'd loll all over my spacious, cool bed that no one has night sweats in...  




 "Take care!" 




 Neil Young!  




 So would you say it's safe to say, when it comes to marriage, you believe that people make their own beds and have to sleep (not have sex) in them? 




 This image just changed my life.  For the better?  It's not clear yet.  




 But Grumbler, what if your spouse hates to talk?  Avoids conversation like the plague?  




 I've recently discovered that my 8 month old daughter is obsessed with teeth.  She's stopped looking at faces and only looks at teeth.  If you get too close, she'll try to touch them.  Stranger still, she thinks they are funny.  She'll laugh if she touches them.  




 When holding your baby for the first time. 




 /u/late_night_grumbler - I've always wanted to see if Oscar the Grouch is as green as he looks in person. ;) 




 Don't worry, you have my word on all of this. :)

I'm very optimistic about you kids... You seem passionate, involved, and aware for your age.  I think you'll accomplish wonderful things.   




 What can millennials do to support you?  

This is probably pretty broad, but man, considering the garbage we have to put up with from the baby boomers regarding us and our life choices, I don't want to be that person...  




 We don't.  Both my mother and my husband are the type of people who will switch sides if you agree with them.  Ahahaha! (But it's not funny, it's annoying as fuck.) 




 I went out to lunch with a new co-worker.  He was obviously a very manipulative person.  He would make an assumption based on something innocuous I would mention, turn it into a piece of flattery, and then use it to ask an extremely verbose question that wasn't something I could actually answer, it was just to illustrate how smart he was....

This is vague.  Here:

Me: Oh, well I do intermittent fasting, so I didn't have breakfast.

Him: So, you seem to be very well aware that the US government is lying to us about how is in our food and what long term effects those lies have on us, and you're not having it.  That said, do you have any secrets or strategies you'd like to share regarding prenatal dieting to promote newborn growth and development?

Me: Um. No... I, uh, just didn't eat lunch meat.  (WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?)

Then we got in his car and he had a fuzz buster... And then he told me his favorite Led Zeppelin Album is IV.  I decided to never suggest we get lunch again.  




 Well, I will say that KIDS think you're one of them.  I had a funny incident with my best friend and her girlfriend where their 11 year olds kept trying to get me to flake off the adult group and do things with them.  Eventually my best friend had to explain that I'm a grown up and they needed to ignore me.  Ahahaha.  

The most ridiculous had to be when I was in Houston on a business trip.  I was 27, six months pregnant (like obviously pregnant, I weigh 107 lbs normally, so that baby was wayyyy out there).  I went to dinner with my CEO.  We sat down and the waiter handed him a normal folding menu.  They brought me a regulation sized football on a tee with the menu items printed on it.  This was a children's menu.  

The night I got married, I was 24.  I went out to dinner with my groom, his step sister and her husband.  The waitress was probably 17.  She looked up and said "So three adults and one child then?"

On my 16th birthday, I was turned away from seeing a PG-13 film.

When I lived in Ames, IA, I paid the child's bus fare of $.50 well into my mid-20's. 

I was once asked at a nightclub who I bribed to get my ID since it listed me as drinking age.
 




 Yeah, absolutely.  It's defensiveness at its finest.  The truth is that you're subjected to just as much, if not more, familial judgment once you HAVE the kid... You're not sleep training right or you aren't holding the baby right or you're not feeding them solids soon enough or god only knows what.  

Seriously, I'd just as soon not talk about my experiences as a parent.  I get not wanting to hear about it, and truthfully, it's not all that I'm thinking about... what a special snowflake my baby is and how to best strategize her whole life... I have a career and a marriage.  I'm a home owner, I volunteer for six hours a weekend as a companion for Hospice.  I have hobbies and interests that are independent of that little person I'm responsible for.  Having a baby doesn't lobotomize you and making your children the literal center of your universe only ensures they will be ill-prepared for their lives later on.  

Much like feminists and tumblr, a few nutjobs on Facebook have made us out to be completely crazed terrorists.  




 Yeah seriously.... if you don't want kids, and you have as much resentment for them as it seems, you probably shouldn't be a parent any way.... My Grandmother in law was always telling her daughters to their faces she never wanted them and they just held her back.  That's an awful thing to do to someone.  I don't want that for any child.  




 It really bothers me that child-free people attack children instead of the adults who are supposedly infringing on their freedom of choice.  Calling a little person a "shit-machine" is not cool.  You started out as a child too.  There's no need to be awful to little kids just because you don't want them.  




 You've got this wrong... if you see us next to actual children, we're obviously not children... it's when you lack proper context that people get confused.  Your character needs to be at an event with a bunch of adults.  I'm routinely offered a child's movie ticket and children's menus, but it's only when I'm out with taller adults... I'm nearly 30.  




 She's doing it wrong then.  I've had seven wedding proposals in my lifetime.  My actual husband never even proposed.  




 It's the true things that are the funniest... this is perfect fan-girl in 6th grade logic... I always imagined painting a wonderful portrait (of Tom Petty because I'm weird and have daddy issues) a la Marge Simpson... Fall wedding (he'd wear that light brown leather jacket with the tassels and I'd be in a tie-dye dress I'd never be caught dead in as an adult). 




 I'd have a ring of sunflowers around my left ankle.  Very 1990's.  My mom still bothers me about following through with this someday.  Uh, no.  




 I'm not surprised, but you can see right in my original post what the rationale is.... if you try to help someone, it shows there is a deeper investment there than a superficial, unnatural, and simple validation.  It shows you were listening and took the time to think about the how and why and what can be done.  A smart person doesn't surround themselves with "yes people," they find those who know what works and cut out what doesn't.    




 That's because most women want you to agree with them and tell them they're not crazy...  




 Really, why is that? 




 I have been a [manic pixie dream girl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_Pixie_Dream_Girl) for well over half of my serious relationships. 




 Attempt to solve or advise me how to solve what is bothering me.  I don't like it when men commiserate, it sends off warning bells.  I prefer a pragmatic 12 step solution.  Even if I don't take your advice, it shows you care.  Agreeing with me just tells me you want me to like you.  




 The best damn thing.  




 Answering machines.  I remember I used to love fiddling with that little cassette tape... it was so cute! :) 




 I like to laugh, and you make me laugh.  I feel obligated to talk about the things I love. :) 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2oijc5/girls_of_reddit_when_the_guys_arent_around_what/cmnfnr3?context=3

I'm not sure what it really is, but it should probably be this gem from the /u/late_night_grumbler .... I still laugh every time.  




 United States of Whatever - Liam Lynch

 I actually don't know anything about the guy behind the Radio Dept.  Although I think he might be a bit druggy... It'll be fine, I'm guessing.  




 I think it was intentional... Pard.  




 I think you'll find that these kinds of things are easy to pick up on right when you meet someone.  Typically it doesn't get as far as dating.  They've been written off before romantic involvement.  




 I would install a sump pump in my basement and remodel my bathroom.  




 Emphasis on that flossing bit... if you floss daily, you will add 5-10 years onto your lifespan.  It's very important, folks.  And if you don't suffer from Halitosis but do have bad breath, this is how you cure it!   




 J.K. Rowling addressed this.  She said it isn't taught in school, unfortunately.  She said that Wizards and Witches are pretty modest and self-conscious about the subject.  There was also a bit about group masturbation among Hufflepuffs, but that might've been a joke.  Sounds about right, however...   




 No, no, sorry.  The e-mail and phone systems are totally separate.  Here: Re-write: "One of the entry-level minimum-wage employees replied to all..." 




 Oh, sorry, the point was supposed to be that an entry level employee replied to all... I suppose the point is lost if you don't know I was working in Client Services for a huge Outsourcing firm.  




 Light (i.e. light roast, and light-hearted), sweet, and early. 




 A company-wide e-mail went out about our CEO stepping down.  One of the agents on the telephone replied to all on it saying she needed to have an IUD put in before she ended up pregnant again.   




 It's awkward to lift something and position it securely over the console from the driver's seat.  It's safer to situate the item properly by coming at it unobstructed and in a way that will make you certain it will stay in place.  Also, being that I'm 4'11.5", the wheel of my car and the seat are close enough together, not much fits... I don't have room to maneuver my bent elbow around.  I'd rather open the other door than reposition my seat.    




 I'm going to reply again, I got interrupted the first time. :)

If you're a lady, you might want to at least take a few cheesecake photos at home if you don't want to do actual bedroom shots.  Your body is never going to look the same, and you'll be glad you captured yourself in all your glory.  Keep them locked up, of course and out of the iCloud ;)

For saving up for your (or the mother of your children's) maternity leave, all the books will tell you to save salary for what you'll be out... that's great except most of us don't get paid in current week.  You'll want to save time out plus three weeks since that's how long it'll take before your first paycheck rolls in.

To expand upon the travel thing, if you like to go fishing and camping, please make sure to do that, it's going to be a few years before you're able to do that as a few day affair (you can have the in-laws watch the baby and boat for a few hours, but c'mon... it's not the same and you'll probably just miss the baby).

You should also just make a lot of time to be romantic with your partner.  Work on strengthening your relationship to the best of your ability.  The next few years will be a challenge and that part of your life is going to get pushed to the side quite a bit.  Talk to each other and spend time with each other and just appreciate each other.  :) 




 Well, I tend to find that /r/advice is a better place to go for sincerity, but you definitely won't get the same volume of replies.  If you must ask a question on /r/askreddit it is better to tag it as [serious].  Glad I could help!  




 Any spendy home renovations or projects... like if you know you need a new roof in the next 1-2 years, now is the time...money is going to be tight while you adjust.

 Wow guys... wow.

I would ask them when they think they'll come to a decision and when you will be contacted.  I would ask them (if it wasn't already addressed in the interview) if you will be able to give the full amount of notice needed with your current employer if you are offered this position (you're pointing out how responsible you are).  I would ask them how long they have both been with the company, and emphasize that you're looking for a long-term career in a great company.  




 You're up awfully early... and arguing about LoTR? You must've had a restful weekend. ;) 




 You gave some very solid relationship advice to a kid today about perception and personal responsibility and refusing to be a victim. My wish for you is that you can give that gift to yourself. We live in this strange, beautiful world only once. I would hate for you to miss it by isolating yourself and cutting your life short.  




 Like the old Dr. Pepper slogan "You try it, you get it!" :) 




 Cream cheese and green olives! :) 




 That would make me very sad.  You need to live to find true love, do more traveling, and continue to offer outstanding upholstery.  Don't give up, VanDriver1... you're a cool dude.  




 You shall.  I think you might be clenching your teeth, working out just a little too hard, and pinching the occasional nerve. ;) 




 I want to stress that I'm not a medical professional.  It sounds to me like you have a few things going on.  I encourage you to bring these things up at your next physical.  They sound minor and relatively normal to me, but it's better to get peace of mind from a doctor than from a stranger on the internet.  :)  




 Well, that's kind of ironic of you to say... This link: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/heartattack/signs
was included in two of my replies in this same thread.  You'll notice they're from the same site.  I'll edit for you and add it to the main comment.  




 [I got this for you, friend.](http://www.md-health.com/Tingling-In-Left-Arm.html)  




 I actually didn't mean the multi-player... I meant just by myself. :)  

I only screwed around with the multi-player to do ridiculous things like to summon and become the Lich or the owner of the brothel and get rainbow armor and other stupid things that only amuse you for an hour.  




 The original Neverwinter Nights.  Man, I love that game.  Never gets old to me.  




 I'm not a doctor, however the sensation for a heart attack is commonly described as being only one arm and feeling like ice water is being poured down it.

It sounds to me like you're on the right track with your carpal tunnel theory.  I have it too.  If I use my hands too much during the day, at night I can't hold them over my shoulders without them trembling.  

I wouldn't worry about your heart just yet, but if you're really concerned, mention it at your next physical.

Take care! :) 




 I'm sorry to hear that your wife had heart issues.  I hope she's doing better now. 




 Well, just in case you want to read more about it, here is a great publication from the US Dept. of Health and Human Services.  It does say right in here that they don't believe the differences to be stark enough to alter the way we educate people about symptoms, however, it definitely talks about a proven delineation. 

http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/dec2007/nhlbi-10.htm 




 That's a great question.  [This article](http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/dec2007/nhlbi-10.htm) from the US Dept. of Health and Human Services correlates it to the fact that women live longer than men and the older you are, the less likely pain in your chest would be an obvious symptom.

 There is this stupid poster I made posted on every surface at my former job.  I made it in MS Paint.  Everyone thinks my husband made it. 

I also wrote their 100+ page orientation manual for incoming supervisors, but I went with a version code rather than listing myself as the author.  Same goes for the calling software user manual.  




 I walk on my tip-toes when I'm not wearing shoes.  My daughter is 8 months old... she's just started pulling herself into a standing position, but never stays flat on her feet. Awww.  




 Okage.  Shadow King Stan is hilarious!  In fact, the whole game is hilarious!   




 This isn't something I feel I need to purposefully state to head off advances... if I'm talking to someone as a fellow human being, sooner or later I'm going to bring up my husband in an anecdote or some other natural mention, as he's a huge part of my life.  If someone wants to know if I'm available, all they need to do is be observant enough to see the ring on my left hand.   




 Willow Lake shampoo and Orbitz soft drinks.  




 This question is super broad, so instead I'm just going to tell you a ridiculous story.

My general practitioner doesn't do pre-natal, so I was referred to an OB/GYN for all of those appointments.  In my first trimester of pregnancy, I got Shingles.  Shingles is technically a type of non-sexually transmitted herpes related to a mutation in the Chicken Pox virus stored in your body.  Because it was unrelated to my pregnancy, my general prescribed Valtrex to cure it.  I was to take it for a week.

Every appointment my OB/GYN would ask me how my Valtrex was treating me.  And I'd have to explain again, that I had shingles... I took it for a week, it's not ongoing... The third time this happened, I said all this again, and she said "So no outbreaks in your genital area causing you concern?" 

My OB thought I had herpes and was too embarrassed to discuss it.  I lived in serious fear she was going to order a C-Section to avoid me infecting my baby's eyes with an STI I didn't actually have.  




 Well, Tim Allen served time for being a cocaine dealer in his pre-Home Improvement days.  Apparently people either don't know about this, or don't care.  




 Sadly no, but the later is the goal in mind.  I'd start looking for jobs again as soon as possible.  Good luck, sir!  




 By secretly drop, do you mean go incommunicado or do you mean selling your contract to an employer?  




 I'm only shocked that more people don't realize that Bill Gates had rich parents.  Yeah, he's much, much richer than his parents, but the asshole had a Porche at 16.  It really grinds my gears every time I have to read that sanctimonious graduation speech of his about how you're an idiot for thinking your parents aren't people.  We didn't all grow up like you did, taking our parents for granted and treating them like shit, man.  It's not universally appropriate.  




 This is more of a public service announcement: Men and women have different early symptoms during a heart attack.  The commonly known ones are men-specific (numbness and tingling in one arm).  The early sign for women is a constricted throat.  Please talk about this in real life, you could save a life. 

Edit: [Further Reading](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/heartattack/signs) 




 Listen man, again, I never said I was raped. I don't believe I was. This discussion is happening outside of my reality. I'm glad that people are having a meaningful discussion about gender roles and assault and personal responsibility, but you'll notice I replied to a "one night stand" thread, not a listen to my sexual assault sob story thread. I was a young college student with an Internet boyfriend. This was almost a decade ago and both me and my ex are now married to other people. The kid the story is about is in a serious relationship.  




 I was knitting for years before the baby.  I'm a pretty fierce technical knitter.  My baby has only two things I've knitted her... an egg plant and some sock-topped moccasins.  




 I *was*... I have a baby now.  All my interests are on hold for the next five years minimum.  I also used to do relief print making and read voraciously.  These days I just knit.  




 The Sims 2... the little movies for important life events were so precious.   




 Probably their hair.  




 I got really heated about some asshole telling a newbie on the Pullip forum that a type 3 body and an Obitsu were comparable in height.  Yes, I know this looks like it was written in another language, but damn, don't lie to people just getting into the hobby! 




 Right?  I don't feel that much younger, but one time he said to me that he saw Nirvana play live in 1991 at First Ave in Minneapolis.... in '91, I was uh... four.  I was four.  




 I CANNOT believe it took someone this long to make this comment.  I thought this was going to be the first thing someone said.  Listen man, I'm really into color theory.  




 "We'll kick your ass" is better than "We'll put a boot in your ass."  I think you missed my point entirely.  




 Shout-out to "Accidental Racist" too.... I mean, this is one of those songs that when you tell people about it, they think you're kidding.  




 No.  My husband is 11 years older than me.  While this mattered less in my 20's, in my teens, it would have been very inappropriate.  Furthermore, my husband was jawdroppingly handsome in high school.  If we had been the same age, he would have been wayyyyy out of my league.     




 "We'll put a boot in your ass, it's the American Way."

Thanks for making us all look like assholes, Toby.  Jesus.  




 Well, I was very drunk, so drunk logic was telling me to punish myself for being unfaithful to my boyfriend.  I definitely regretted it later...  This incident was the catalyst for me to go on an anti-depressant.  




 Is it really necessary to call me a rapist?  You've taken an idea and made it quite personal.  I never used the word rape.  If you read my comment carefully, you'd be able to deduce that I felt awful about the whole thing.  I didn't attempt to press charges or any thing like that.  I bought him new sheets.  I get why you're upset, but let's not level a rape accusation at me to prove a point.  




 Uhhh.  I mean, I can list some arbitrary things that were wrong with me 7 years ago, but I'm guessing you're referencing something specific to this anecdote... your comment just doesn't help me narrow down what exactly.   




 I went over to this new friend's house.  Things started out fine.  He made breakfast for dinner.  He suggested we play a drinking game.  He got aggressive with things like "Never have I ever worn purple sneakers," or "Never have I ever worn a yellow hoodie," these being things I was actually wearing.  We were drinking vodka.  I got blackout drunk.  He ordered a $80 box set on my Amazon account as a birthday present for himself (which lead me to overdraw my account being that I didn't know about it until that happened).  We had sex while I was blacked out.  I bled all over his sheets because I was on my period.  When I woke up I was really upset because I had a boyfriend.  I ended up banging my wrist against the sink in the bathroom until I had a bunch of bruises.  He got me into the shower and calmed me down.  We never had sex again.  Insult to injury: I overdrew my account buying him new sheets.  




 My husband is 39.  He refuses to associate outside of work with anyone who is not part of his immediate family.  He has no real friends.  




 lol, I love you, but you know full-well I'm married to a man.  I was never a lesbian.  He was just bitter af. 




 I got a queen sized Martha Stewart Coral Spray duvet for $14.99.  I lost it in a break-up, and I loved the damn thing... to get another, I'd have to pay about $100 on eBay.
