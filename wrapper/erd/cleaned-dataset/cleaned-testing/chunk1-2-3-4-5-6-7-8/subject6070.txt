 I drink a lot of water before bed, that way if I wake up even a bit my "I really have to pee" response kicks in and I am out of the bed and into the bathroom.
edit typo 




 I think about it the same way i think about drinking, most people can do it in moderation and it isn't a big deal some people have an addiction that they may need to seek help for but in either case it is not my place to judge someone. My old roommate is an amazing person , she is also a self described food addict. She developed type 2 diabetes at 19, and that wasn't enough to make her change her eating and exercise habits. She is a RN now still obese still eats fast food 4 times a week. Part of her really wants to change , but for whatever reason she's not ready to take the steps needed. I still love her dearly and I want her to make changes and would be happy to help her do that but I know she has to be ready or it will never work. 




 Where are you standing on the scale? Standing to the back of the scale makes you lighter and the front heavier. If you are female it could also have to do with your cycle, and water retention. I would also look into your portions I worked out for 4 times a week for 3 months and didn't drop an ounce until I started counting calories, Myfitnesspal.com is a great place to start.Also sometimes it helped me to put the scale away for a while and only weigh every 2 weeks or so. Best of luck keep at it! 




 I teach US history to high school students, I want to start the beginning of each class this month with some interesting stories about African American Heros. I want to expose them to people they may  have never heard of though. So let me know who you wished you had learned about in High School.  




 I once had a man come up to me and tell me he liked my jeans, to which I replied oh thanks they are lucky brand, to which he replied I meant your phenotype. I then laughed and he said hot and smart, now you have to let me buy you a drink. More of a pick up line than a compliment but it worked we dated for three years. 




 I became a vegetarian when I was 12, I am now in my late 20s, I still weigh the same as I did in college. I have great blood pressure, and my resting heart beat is 55 bpm. Also I have noticed that I am aging better than many of my meat eating friends. It is better for the planet , and budget friendly. So for me it works if you are thinking about making the switch try cutting one thing out at a time, and adding to the list. Example this week I wont eat beef next week no beef or pork .

 Hey I used to work at a crisis hotline, and it sounds like your brother is taking some positive steps, he is talking about it and he is open to getting help. 
So now it sounds like we need to make him a safety plan. 
Step one :ask him if he has a plan to kill himself  if he does remove the means, get rid of pills guns razors whatever he has been thinking about using
Step two : Ask him what has helped him in the past when things have been though , talking to people ,writing everything down, running, everyone has their own ways to deal with stress what are his encourage him to try some of those things
Step Three : Ease the Pain, ask him if there is anything that helps him take his mind off of his problems even if it is only for a little while. Something that could give him a break from everything that is going on. (taking a bath, watching a movie reading a book whatever works for him)
Step four: get him around people even if it isn't friends studies have shown that just going to public places can ease suicidal thoughts
Step five : keep him away from drugs or booze, theses things increase the likely hood someone will attempt .
Step six: Who are his trusted listeners , it sounds like you are one of them but are there other people he feels like he can talk to about what is going on ? sometimes just talking about it can help even if nothing gets solved.
Listen to what he says, depressed people sometimes just want to vent what is going on and may not want a solution instead of offering ways to fix the problem ask the questions above and let him come up with his answers , he will be more likely to follow the plan if he comes up with it. 
Hopefully this will keep him safe until he can get professional help. You could also incorporate a crisis hotline or the ER into his safety plan as back ups. Hope this is helpful for you and I'll keep your brother in my thoughts 
Also he may not have an answer to all the questions and thats ok, the idea is to get him thinking about how he is going to get through the next few days.  




 1 It will seem really overrated in the beginning. 
2.Do it with someone you love the first time and there is a good chance you wont regret it.
3.Once you start having sex there is no going back. 
4. Don't let anyone pressure you into it, it is your choice how you use your body and who you use it with (this doesn't just go for your first time it goes for every time) 




 Assuming that there is a genetic component to homosexuality (which science is making a strong case for), It probably wont die out in a generation or two because like with any genetic trait their are many straight people who may not be gay themselves but may carry the gene. Much in the same way that two brown eyed parents can have a blue eyed child. On the other side of this is the fact that many gay couples do have children and use their own genetic information to do so, and just use a donor for the seamen or the egg (depending on which one they need).
 




 My boyfriend drooled on my pillow and when we woke up i said "ewww you drooled all by my face "
and he said laughing "it just means that I love you"
which is how he told me he loved me for the first time.
So if you want to distract a lady friend from your drool just drop the L-bomb 




 what's on the list? 




 I looked for the things that I got excited about, and for the things that pulled at my heart strings. that brought me to the idea that I wanted to help people  then I had to figure out what kind of job I could get helping people. I had always had an ability to break things down simply, so I would become a teacher. I tell me high school seniors to think about what they love and what they are good at and try to find a job that uses their talents  









 Well you can make the argument that he wasn't the first president, because we declared independence in 1776 and Washington didn't take office until 1789, so there was a 15 year period where other people ran the country. these men (all 8 of them) were presidents of congress because the position of president of the executive branch wasn't created until the Constitution was written.

 I had a high school students ask if the United States was part of the United Kingdom, the class fell apart laughing. I didn't want the kid to not ever ask a question again , so I said well not anymore but it started out that way, so I can see where that could be confusing everyone stopped laughing and the kid still ask questions. 




 I have dyslexia and instead of learning how to sound things out and turn letters into words I learned to sight read,I know what the word looks like to me. New words are difficult because I can't really read them, often i'll ask someone to read it to me and then I can typically remember. so maybe instead of trying to teach them the sounds of the letter you could try teaching them whole words. Remember what this word sounds and looks like. I guess this would depend on the case though, when I work with special education students I try to see what strengths they have and then use them to compensate for their weakness.  




 I think he was being chased for smoking on school property  




 Network like crazy, go to every job fair you can, check out the chamber of commerce meetings, and see what job connections your professors have.The longer I am in the professional world the more I agree with the statement "it isn't what you know , but who you know." Also be punctual and play nice with others, being late and not getting along with co-workers are the main reasons people get fired. 




 I once saw a police officer chasing a student the kid was wearing a backpack and when the officer grabbed it the kid just threw his arms back and slipped out of the backpack. Then the weight of the back pack knocked the policeman off balance and he fell into the street. Everyone who was watching cheered.

 Once when I was young my parents had some friends over, around 830 my sister and I went to bed I woke up around 11 because I heard my parents laughing really hard I went to the stairs banister (where I could see them and they couldn't see me). They were smoking what I thought at the time were cigarettes with little scissors. It wasn't until I got to college that I realized that they were smoking joints with hemostats. 




 I wish I could take homeless people to my house on cold nights let them shower, feed them dinner and sleep over. I worry about them when it is cold outside.

 I'd like to see a multi-party political system, and the end of winner take all elections. I like how in other countries what % of the vote you get determines how many seats the party gets in the legislative branch.

 I am surprised at how getting older doesn't make me sad, I am happier at 27 than I ever was at 21. With every birthday I just feel like I am turning into the person I was meant to be. 




 I am just taking a guess here but many people brink a Christmas tree into their house which has a somewhat minty smell so maybe the association happened that way. My other theory would be that peppermint sticks were white and red which were also Christmas colors so people bought them for decoration. However it would be hard to say if peppermint was white and red before the association , or because of the association.
 





























 It depends, if it is a large order than yes, because I am responsible for making sure that every thing comes out properly, boxing it up, and getting the other stuff like silverware, to go drinks etc., but even on a large order 10% is considered the standard. On a small order (2 or less meals) no tip required but leaving a dollar or two is always appreciated.  




 I've lived with a few male roommates, for the most part they are a bit messier than the girls I lived with, but had less drama so fair trade in my book. Some girls are crazy as fuck. 




 When I was 13 I had a friend who was form Vietnam, she had been in the US since she was 6 months old so she spoke english fluently. Her parents however spoke very little English. One night we were at he house and these guys we went to school with were all having a sleep over a couple blocks away, we decided to sneak out of the house and go hang out with the boys, after a few hours we needed to get back to the house and the guys walked us home to make sure we got there alright. When we climbed back through the window her dad woke up and thought someone was breaking into the house he called 911, and then busted in her door with a shotgun. He saw me and his daughter fully dressed sitting on her bed and a group of boys running away from the house, the cops then showed up. My friends dad told them they could leave and it was a misunderstanding. He then called my mom and told her I  was a "bad girl" and she needed to pick me up. While we were waiting for my mom he gave lecture about how dangerous it was to sneak out and to spend time with boys who could rape us. He would lecture for a few minuets then my friend would translate his words. When my mom showed up it came across like he was trying to blame us sneaking out on me ( I am not sure if he was truly trying to blame me or if it was his limited vocabulary). My mom then blamed him for not keeping a better eye on us. My friend and I weren't allowed to hang out anymore after that. That was almost 15 years ago and we are still best friends today.  




 I love my job, it is the most challenging, and rewarding thing I have ever done. It pushes me to be a better person every day because I want to be better for my students every day. I  have kids tell me their darkest secrets and I am always happy to try and help them sort out what is going on in their life. I do enjoy my content area, but it pales in comparison to the students and how they touch my life. You are going into one of the most important professions in society, for some students you will be one of the only good role models they have, one of the only adults they trust, you will be able to push them to expand their mind, they will love you and because of that they will be willing to at least try to do the work. Do everything out of love, even when kids get in trouble, explain why the rules are important for everyone to follow so that the classroom is safe and that the punishments are their for the same reason . I very rarely yell, I find it is much more effective to talk to students in the hall way if we are having issues then to just jump to a detention. Often times kids still get the punishment but we have had the opportunity to talk about why they got it and how to change the behavior in the future . There is a ton of paper work , and there are law makers who come up with systems that make no since to educators , but fuck them. I love my job every day and I will do the paper work and deal with the shitty things because I am tankful to get to do my passion every day and have impact on the next generation. Best of luck to you.  




  He explained the similarities in his interview, he eventually became a manager and said it was very similar to managing a classroom , and that is why he was so successful at it. Just some things to consider before making the switch, pros the money is much better, their are certain perks that come with the job(company trips, nice dinners, and networking ), the down side its that every year is like your first year of teaching, my dad worked 70 hours a week most weeks. The company sets your sales goals and they always expect you to keep inflating sales even if the market is saturated. Another thing to consider is that in recent years drug companies have come under scrutiny and therefor aren't allowed to do a lot of the things that used to make the job fun ( bring doctor offices lunch, take doctors to see speakers , take nurses out to dinner ect) there is a lot less fluff than their used to be. My dad worked for the company for 20 years and has a nice retirement. My mom still works for a different drug company (she was also a former teacher) she said that now they like to see people with a science back ground, so if you teach any STEM classes I would say you have a good shot, also most drug reps would be happy to let you shadow them one day, to get a better idea of what it is like. My dad said that he missed teaching because of the human factor, a couple years before he retired, he started helping out with high school wrestling because he missed working with kids. hope this was helpful , best of luck to you  




 I was a bartender before I was a teacher, the best thing about bar tending is you can't take your work home with you. It took me about 3 years to get into a bar position that I really liked, (most busy bars want a few years of experience) but I made amazing friends had a ton of fun, and made damn near close to what I make as a teacher.  




 I think what set me apart is I have great resume and interview skills. I also dress very well, which seems trivial but getting hired is all about first impressions. One of my friends got hired because they had coached basket ball and the school needed some one to take over JV. 
I think it would be unlikely that a school would hire you before student teaching, and honestly you wouldn't want to teach before you student teach. Student teaching is really where you gain most of your skills like classroom management , non instructional routines, and how to handle your work load. 
Does your school offer certification before student teaching? 




 I have always had a theory that most great teachers burn out around 10 years, because teaching is a hammer of a profession and if you are giving it your all, then it isn't sustainable for most people. I admire you for recognizing that you need a change and not becoming one of those teachers who "don't teach" , or takes their anger out on their students. Both my parent were teachers and my dad left after 15 years and became a drug rep. Drug companies like teachers because they are good at learning information , and explaining it. So maybe give that a shot, best of luck to you .  




 I cater waiter a couple times a week , it is nice to have some extra cash and because I bar tended my way through school it is easy work. I go to the gym a lot, and I volunteer at the suicide hotline. Take some time and go visit family and friends that you haven't seen in a while, often times i am so busy during the year that I don't get to spend much quality time with the ones I love. Hope this helps! 




 I would suggest that if you haven't started your content area that you look into math, special ed, or science. These areas tend to have more job openings , I received a MAT is secondary social studies and was one of 3 teachers who got hired before the school year started. Most of my grad school friends are subbing or considering going to teach ESL in Asia. If I could do it over I would have gotten a degree in special education. 
To answer your second questions most MA programs have student teaching as the last course before you graduate. It is nearly impossible to get hired anywhere without student teaching, even if you have a certificate, most employers want to have an idea of what you are like in the classroom.  hope this is helpful feel free to message me any further questions. 




 I too had an awful experience with k2 I smoked some after a night of partying with friends ,at first I just felt high then really parinoid, then my thoughts felt completely splintered. I felt absolutely insane I was with friends and didn't want to freak anyone out so I went into the back room and laid in the fetal postion for hours my friends came to check on me I couldn't speak in complete sentences. I was very worried that I had done permanent damage to my brian after 8 hours of feeling like this I started to feel better but it took about a week before I felt normal. K2 is horrible and should never be compared to actual weed. 




 Freakenomics suggested that part of the reason that crime decreased was because abortions became easily available after Roe V Wade, and because their we less unprepared parents, and everything that can go a long with that (poverty, less education, less resources ) their were less criminals produced. They used statistical information form the US and Romania to show the link between the availability of abortions and crime rates over the next 30 years.  









 Rule number 1 of being a vegan is bring your own food and bring enough for others to eat. It sucks to get picked on for wanting to live a compassionate life, the way I have handled it is by killing people with kindness. I never expect there to be anything for me to eat unless I am at my house. I keep dried fruit and nuts in my bag at all times just in case I get in a predicament. I very rarely mention to people that I am vegan. If people do know that I am a vegan and ask me a bunch of questions about what I eat I offer to bring them a vegan lunch the next day  a lot of people enjoy it and then asking for vegan options becomes more of a group thing and not just you "being a demanding vegan". I remind my self that becoming a vegan didn't happen overnight for me ,so I can't expect people to understand it overnight. 

TL;DR make some allies in the office , make them see veganism differently through your actions.

 I used to work at 24 hour suicide hotline, you would be amazed at the number of calls I would get on an over night where guys were trying to get me to have phone sex or get me to say things that they could jerk it to.  




 Bald men are sexy, from my experience they have a good since of humor, and are fantastic in bed. Own your bald head, if you wear a hat make sure to take it off at some point when you meet someone for the first time so that they aren't shocked or don't recognize you next time. 




 I too teach history, you are entitled to your opinion. But it really bothers me when teachers complain about their salary. You knew what you were signing up for and there is more than one way to get paid.  




 You must not be a history teacher. 




 I would hypothesize that life expectancy stayed about the same. Slave owners saw their slaves as investments and they wanted to keep them a live as long as possible. After the war the Union controlled much of the government regulation for the first few years, so lynching of freed slaves wasn't very prevalent. Most freed slaves had little education or skills, many became share croppers which is very similar to slavery.  




 How long some one had left to live , but they couldn't see it and no body could tell them , but every one would know. 




 When students slack off all quarter and then try and make up 9 weeks worth of work in 2 days , and bullys fuck that shit . I am pretty laid back but if you are rude to me or mean to another student I will bring the reckoning down on you. 




 It depends on if the gold bricks were redistributed from the gold that already exists or if new gold was some how made. If it was just redistributed and still held its value then it would close some of the income gap. If it was created  then it would become devalued.most likey used for electronics. It would not effect fiat currency , because this money is separate from the value of gold, and the  government it what determines the value. It would proably have a negative effect on any gold based currency 




 I have a bachelors  and a masters degree both from regular university to get an addional certification in my field I took two online classes , they were no were near as difficult or engaging as the classes I took in a real classroom. I don't feel like I learned as much from them, based on my experience if  someone had a degree that was done completely online , I wouldn't consider their education to be as thorough.
 




 I would say it is not a good first date question, see how it goes maybe you'll hit it off maybe you wont, and if you don't no need to ask. i think most women who aren't trans would be somewhat offended if they were asked , and then you become one of those "worst date ever stories" 




 What are you contributing, to the causes that you hold dearest to your heart? Made me change my career. 




 that is an good point 




 One of my best friends is transgendered, and she feels like it is dehumanizing to ask if she has had surgery to become a woman. She said if you wouldn't ask a non transgendered person about their genitals why is it acceptable to ask her. I also know that she is very open with everyone she dates that she wasn't born in a woman's body. I would get to know the woman if you like her keep dating her and she will probably tell you about it when she is ready. If she isn't trans then you'll most likely find out when the relationship becomes physical. If you aren't cool with dating someone who is trans then maybe you could bring it up in conversation with her and gage her reaction with out straight up asking her. But if you are cool with dating someone who is trans, then just keep dating if things are going well and like most secrets she will tell you when she feels she can trust you. To me it sounds like you find her attractive and like her enough to ask her out again so why are you letting your friend mess with your head ? 




 what artist would you like to see cover one of your songs?  




 I was a bartender for a long time , so I've hear pretty much everything but a guy came in one night kept ordering whiskey on the rocks, and then he ordered a red headed slut, I brought him the shot. then he said "I wasn't talking about the shot I was talking about you" and put 200$ down on the bar, and his hotel key. (I guess I should mention I am strawberry blond) Still grosses me out to think about it. 




 He's running a marathon, I follow a blogger who snapped this photo. Here is the link with an interview with the guy pictured for those interested.

 There are plenty of intellectuals who smoke. I have a masters and most of the people in my career field are well in formed educated people. Most of us smoke weed in moderation. We hang out, cook dinner, play music, talk about societies issues, and laugh really hard about silly things. It can be a great tool to unwind and relax with friends. I completely agree that stoners, like any one who abuses a substance give it a stigma that I wouldn't want to associate with either. 

tl;dr find cool people to smoke with instead of stoners

 You have a responsibility to your students to keep the environment of your class safe and conductive to learning. Having someone who is not participating can be distracting and throw off the energy of the practice. I think you did the right thing, have you checked with other co workers to see if it has been an issue in anyone else's class? 




 I would start by considering what you are looking for in a teacher and a practice, is there a style you prefer? Or are you searching more for a teacher you vibe with?
I don't care for the brand lulu lemon, but the people who work in the stores tend to be pretty in sync with the yoga community. That may be a place to get started. 
Best of luck to you! 




 Teaching is the hardest, most time consuming, and difficult thing I have ever done, but I wouldn't do anything else. My mentor said something great to me , I can teach you how to make a lesson better I can teach you to manage a class, but I can't teach you to love kids. I think thats what makes a good teacher, it is how much do you care about your students . I love my kids so I push myself to make better lessons , I make sure I do everything I can to help them succeed, and I make sure they know how much I care. I have seen teachers who go into teaching because they love their content area , and those teachers burn out quickly , because no matter how much you love math if you don't like kids it won't be worth it in the end. Hope that helps some best of luck. 




 Thanks for the info, not trying to lose weight  (I am 5'7 130 lbs) but I just noticed that I have a lot of sugar in my diet, I love baking , and dark chocolate. I have a strong family history of type 2 diabetes and while I don't have any risk factors now I would like to try and tame my sweet tooth before it becomes a problem.  




 I'll keep you posted on how it is going.  




 So I would like to give up foods with added sugar in my diet for the next 30 days. I was wondering if anyone would like to join me, or if anyone has advice on getting rid of added sugar?
Edit People have been asking why I want to do this, it is partially because of a family history of type 2 diabetics, but also because of the other health issues that seem to be related to added sugar. I AM NOT TRYING TO LOSE WEIGHT, just trying to feel better and hopefully reduce my risk for disease. Also thanks for all the support r/vegan  




 There are different certifications for yoga teachers, and they are typically done by hours 200 hour 500 hour ect. I am not sure how they measure the hours though.

 If you meet someone who is great date them, if you are happy being single and no one strikes your fancy then be single. I will say that dating in college is like an experiment and it is likely that at no other point in your life you will have as many variables. i.e. there are many different types of people to date in college and this can help you figure out what you are looking for. I had one of my worst boyfriends while I was in college followed by one of the best. College is about figuring out who you are and what you want out of life if you want to do that by your self great if you meet someone to share in your adventure of self discovery then thats great too. Hope that was helpful. 




 I started a new job that I love.
I met the love of my life.
I moved into my first place by myself. 
My SO and I moved in together and then 2 weeks later he got a great job opportunity 6 hours away and he moved out , now we are doing the long distance thing 




 I was never overweight, but I lost 10 pounds by going vegan ( I was already a vegetarian), cutting back on the wine I drink , and hitting up the gym 3 to 4 times a week. I did all of these things to feel better not to really to lose weight  but small changes add up.  




 Daiya vegan cheese , cheese was the one thing that was super hard for me to give up and nutritional yeast only does so much. I love Daiya it melts it is yummy and I can have a grilled "cheese" with tomato soup. 




 thanks ! 




 I loved psyc, but I got out of college and I was bar tending to make ends meet, I had planned to go to grad school and become a counselor but I wanted to take some time off. Part of being a bartender is talking to people listening to problems I was good at it but I was exhausted by it (I am sure that the 12 hour shifts didn't help) and you can't really offer any real solutions, you can just listen .I figured I needed get a better feel for if I wanted to be a counselor, I started working for a crisis hotline that too left me feeling burnt out. I went a head and applied to grad school , a few psyc programs and a couple education programs . I got into a few schools and I decided to go with education , I had a real tough time when I was in middle and high school , and it would have been much worse if it wasn't for a few out standing teachers. I felt this was a way for me to help people , that was sustainable for me. I love my job , it is very challenging, and time consuming, but I wouldn't trade it for the world.  




 Well I teach high school now, so some times I accuse my students of having Landau-Kleffner Syndrome, a disorder where children forget how to express themselves or understand their native language. 




 I suppose I could be delusional, but I am very aware that it is just for fun in my own mind, and that the majority of people aren't suffering from a psychological disorder.  




 BS in psyc MA in education 




 Abnormal psychology, I got a psyc degree before I became a teacher and spent a lot of time studying abnormal psyc. I found it fascinating and terrifying at the same time. I have a deep seeded fear I'll get dissociative fugue at some point in my life. I also secretly diagnose everyone with very mild forms of psychological disorders in my head just to keep myself from forgetting the symptoms. 




 but why ? Are their genes that tell them to move back ?

 I am a teacher so I am on my feet all day, I love the look and feel of leather shoes , but not the suffering. I have bought many Vegan "leather" shoes, but they tend to fall apart, give me blisters, and look a bit cheap. Please help me find some stylish, comfortable, and durable shoes for the new school year! 




 I find the most effective argument to go vegan is, to show people that you are happy and healthy. People always ask why I choose to eat this way and I tell them because of the environment and animal cruelty, I typically leave it at that, but I may say if they are interested to check out book x or documentary z. Its not preachy it encourages them to seek out their own answers. It also doesn't hurt that I am lean, unfortunately a lot of women are only interested in veganism because they think they will lose weight (case and point skinny bitch)
Oh and Peta has lost all credibility in most people's minds so it doesn't matter how loud they scream no one wants to listen. 




 Pros everything stays pretty clean, you can have sex where ever you want, lots of privacy
cons you don't have someone to keep your pet company when you aren't home, no one to vent to about your day, those weird noises you hear at night can't be blamed on your roommate...so I think that someone is breakinginto my house a lot more

 Al gore ...robot voice 




 When I was in high school I went to a ci cis pizza buffet, my friends and I had gotten our plates and started to eat.I got some sauce on my mouth and reached for a
 napkin out of the dispensers.30 or so little roaches started crawling out of the napkin holder and on to the table. My friends and I began to scream the manager came over to see what was wrong , he calmly picked up the holder and took it in the back their were still roaches crawling everywhere so we ran out , and never came back. 




 I'm guessing that if she is 23 then she just finished her first year of teaching,   so here are a few things I would have loved after my first year teaching(some of these are more romantic than others) 
A trip to a museum, or historical site ( teach history, but this could be adapted to any subject or any interest)
Replace some sort of technology that she uses daily ( printer, laptop, Ipad, etc)
Or just plan an evening with her , take her to dinner, go dancing, check out a band, sometimes as a teacher it is just really nice to have someone else plan things to do. 
Hope this was helpful, you sound like a thoughtful boyfriend 




 Ear plugs and an eye mask, in college everyone has such different schedules these things can save you if you have an exam the next day and your neighbors/ roommates are being loud...or if you are hungover and need to sleep it off while the rest of the world buzzes about. Speaking of hangovers keep gatorade or coconut water on hand drink half of it before you go to bed after a night of drinking and the other half in the morning, it helps take the edge off. Bonus if you can get the extra electrolyte packets that gatorade makes , check with your friends who are in the athletic trainer program.

edit a word 




 Are you kidding me I encourage my seniors to become welders, or go into construction, if they know they dont want to go to traditional college, the military and police academy always come up for options too. Teachers need to realize not everyone wants to go to college not everyone needs too. Sorry your teacher said that welding is a great career. 
























 In my second year, still a lot of work but the first year is burtal. It isn't just the long hours but it is also that most of my friends did not get why I couldn't hang out like I used to. I found myself pretty isolated my first year. Now I have teacher friends , and my old? m
 friends have come to understand that I am not a bartender any more. I love my students and my class room management skills have significantly improved from last year 




 Have the students do a Mini DBQ. For my US I have them watch the crossing and do follow a long question sheet and then write a short essay. It never hurts to have a review of the stuff we do in the beginning of the year. Also mini DBQ, and a movie are pretty hard for a sub to mess up. 




 Forgot to mention the schools on James island are good too 




 It depends on your definition of uniform, elementary and middle schools typically have a "uniform" that consist of certain colors they can wear to school khaki and navy blue pants , and white shirts. Its pretty much a stricter dress code , not a true uniform that the school issues. Most high schools let kids wear whatever as long as it isn't to revealing or offensive. 




 Teacher here, unless you are in Mt. Pleasant the schools in Charleston county are not ideal, Berkley and Dorchester 2 have good options. 




 There is a bar dt called prohibition they have swing bands play from time to time. Other than that I am not sure.

 Cellar door  




 Great straight teeth with no cavities thanks dad, chronic teeth grinding and jaw clenching thanks mom 




 Mr. Feenie 




 I tell my kids on the first day, about my time in school , that I have ADD and dyslexia, that I had a difficult home life. I talk about excuses vs.  adjustment, that I will not accept excuses but that from time to time students need adjustments. I encourage them to let me know if they need an adjustment. As the year goes on I share more and more about my life when it seems to fit, for example we watch student news sometimes and their was a story about a teenager that committed suicide, I told my students I used to work for a suicide hotline and that I would always be there to listen if they needed to talk. I had a student come talk to me a couple weeks later about feeling suicidal. If a kid seems "off" I pull them out in the hall and ask if they are ok, invite them to come see me during lunch.  Even if nothing is going on  it lets them know I care, and more often than not something is going on and they share.   




 I don't actually use twitter, my school is pretty big on not being friends with current students on social media. I give them a post it and have them write a # after we read a short passage. So say we were looking at FDR's speech after pearl harbor, kids might write #teamUSA #WWII #daysthatwillliveinimfany it helps them pick out some of the major points, I use them as an exit slip sometimes.  




 I have been told I have certain set of skills, but I honestly think it is because I never sleep with people that I don't already feel really strong chemistry with. 




 You don't believe in laws like don't rape or kill anyone? I could see not turing them in for drugs or getting in a fight. But if my child severely damaged or killed another human I would turn them in. I would also get them a lawyer and continue to love them, but at that point they are beyond talking to. 




 My cousin was about 10 years older than me so she was an adult in my eyes. I think being around  stable family is great I know I really enjoyed being at my friends house , maybe just take the opportunity when you happen to be alone to ask how things are going. One of my best friends mom used to do this, I would wake up early when I slept over so I could have breakfast and talk to her mom alone.  




 I had two fuck buddies , both were supposed to be my first one night stand, but in both cases the sexual chemistry was so good that we decided to be fuck buddies. I have still never had a real one night stand. 




 Every time I have taken a break it has been because I wanted to pursue things with some one else. Needless to say none of those relationships worked out. The problem with a break is it leaves you in relationship limbo , you can't move on and you can't enjoy the relationship. If you are taking a break to ease the blow of an actual break up or because you would like to stay friends then I would suggest a clean break and an agreement not to talk for 6 months. At the end of 6 months go to lunch , you will probably be able to be friends at that point.  




 Sexual predators almost never attack just once, you would be putting countless people in danger and your child would think that you are simi ok with it because you talked to him / her ab it and didn't turn them in. Some times the hardest part of being a parent is disapline.


 




 My parents went through a really nasty divorce when I was 13. I didn't live close to my aunts or uncles, but here are some things I wish the adults in my life would have done. Don't trash talk either party, I loved my mom I loved my dad but I felt like I had no one neutral to talk to , everyone had taken sides. I wish an adult had taken me to do something one on one, when your parents are divorceing they are so wrapped up in their own drama they forget to take time to be a parent. It is nice to have some one on one time with a stable adult.  My parents did get my sister and I into counseling, but I hated the counselor I finally told my cousin who let my dad know. I got a counselor that I liked after that. If she hadn't given me the space to talk ab my feelings I probably would have never told anyone. Remember that ugly divorces can go on for years even if the paper work is finalized, it wasn't until I went to college that I finally felt relief from my parents drama and manipulation. Unfortunately patent will use their kids to punish one another. 
 




 It depends on the level of the students. If they are higher level you may be able to use reading like a historian. http://sheg.stanford.edu/rlh
I typically use a non primary source to give them an idea of what we are talking about and then give then a primary source document. We break it down as a class after each paragraph we talk about how we would say it. Sometimes I have them do a # that would follow it if it were on twitter to check for understanding. For the Gettysburg Address I break the speech up into sections and have groups re-write it on the white board. For my students primary source work is all bout understanding so anyway we can break it down is huge. You may also be able to use some mini DBQs they have step by step instructions on how to use documents to create an outline and eventually write a argumentative essay. Hope that helps good luck on your first year. 




 This is how pd should go, meet with your department for 30 min meet with your grade level for30 min , go over leagel bs that has to be covered 30min. Have the first years and new teachers meet with admin for an hour to go over school policy. Spend the rest of the day working on what you need to because you are a fucking professional and you know what you need to do. Why is that so hard? I came back to school a week early because of all the pd we have this year. I pitty the teachers that didn't because they are only going to have one day to get everything together. 









 I have never cried because a celebrity died until today. I always felt that Robin Williams was the fun uncle of my generation. His work was peppered through out my childhood and brought me so much joy. He seemed to be touched by fire that made him both brilliant and self destructive. With a heavy heart Robin we will miss you. 




 Perhaps I can shed some light on the situation, I had been in only hetero relationships and while I was interested in f/f relationship it just never really presented itself. I met a lesbian and we hit it off as friends after hanging out a few times she told me that she thought she was developing feelings for me. I was really thankful for her honesty because it let me choose to experiment with her and not feel pushed into it. We dated for a little while and while the physical part of the relationship was good I realized I couldn't fall in love with her and I ended things. Because our relationship was built on honesty we both did minimal damage to one another. 
So your assumption that for mostly straight folks it may not be more than a physical expression may be correct, I think that if you handle this relationship with honesty and respect then it could have a positive out come.  




 I used to be part of a studio that offered fantastic teachers and a variety of yoga classes, but I recently moved, and their was only one place in town that offered yoga. It is at the local gym and  they have yoga 2 days a week, the teacher is newly trained (200 hour) and the class seems to be for beginners. I honestly don't feel challenged in there I love the class because it gives me the space to practice with others, and I always feel more grounded after I leave. However I don't feel like I am progressing in my practice, I have been supplementing with youtube videos, but it isn't the same as having a teacher adjust you especially for more difficult poses. Any suggestions  or advice would be appreciated. 




 I think my biggest victory has been applying my practice off of the mat. I get anxious about things I have no control over and lately when I feel it starting I can focus on my breathing and calm my mind. It also makes me more patient with myself because I think about how many times I fell out of poses before I was able to hold them and that I was only able to do it because I kept trying. I also really enjoy that my body will crave yoga now, I feel what needs to be worked and what poses help me. 




 I get runners high but only after 45 min or so of working out. To be fair though my body is really sensitive. For example if I drink a coke after 12pm I will be up until 1 or 2 am. I also get drunk off of like 2 1/2 beers...so there's that. 




 I was having a discussion with a friend one time about religion, and she said if you don't believe in God then why are sunsets so beautiful? Her reasoning was that their was no evolutionary reason for humans to find sunsets beautiful. There for it was God's way of reminding us that we were souls everyday. It made me happy to think about it for a while. Often times religious people assume that atheism is a choice, it really wasn't for me. When I looked at the evidence I just couldn't believe anymore. Sometimes I wish I could, and sometimes when I watch the sunset I do. 




 Fantastic list thanks 




 The national archives maybe a good place to start, it would depend on what you were teaching but they would almost certainly have documents on how these nations have interacted with the US .
http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/ 
this is the teachers link but the whole site has great resources.
 




 Great list I forgot about some of those , thank you so much! 




 love crash course, use it in my class often! 




 I am putting together my emergency sub plans for the year and I was wondering if you had any suggestions for movies to show to my US History and Government/ Economics classes 




 I have 30 jobs total , but some of them are repeats my desk are split into 3 section and each sections has a specific person to get materials, collect papers, make sure the desk get re-organized after group work, some of my other jobs are answer the phone, open the door when there is a visitor, a person to fix typos on the power point, someone to water the plants, a person to let me know when the supply table is running low. a person to pass back graded work.I give them all very professional sounding names. It helps the class run smoothly and everyone contributes .  




 The first day I am planning to go over the rules, tell the kids a bit about me , and then I give them a dynamic duo card they have to find their partner ( think Batman and Robin , Bonnie and Clyde, Micky and Minnie ) I give them a few minuets to ask their partner questions then I have them present what they learned to the class. After that I assign class room jobs. fill out survey on learning style and home life. discuss materials needed for the class ask them to come see me after if they don't have materials so I can get them for the student ( I work in a title 1 school ) 
The second day, reviewing the rules , talking about classroom procedures (they will have gotten a preview of this when we assigned jobs) practicing some of the procedures . Start going over the syllabus , discuss the major projects and papers and when they will be due. Have kids practice their classroom jobs , mini lesson on what history is and why it is important. 
























 As someone who is dyslexic this is amazing 




 This is amazing you should also post in r/woodworking 




 I teach high school history and I have gotten some great simulations off of tpt. To me it is worth it to pay three dollars than to spend hours creating all the things I would need. But sometimes I just browse it for ideas, and don't buy anything. 




 So I should preface this with the fact that I taught the civil rights movement all week, but I had a dream that Malcolm X broke into my house to rape me , but I was totally into him so we had consensual sex and then I made him pancakes and we talked about environmental protection. 




 I love that I work with people who are intelligent and able to have an open debate and not get emotional or take statements personally. I love that I teach 155 kids about history , and I make it as interesting as possible. I love it when I tell a joke that only half the class gets and then 30 seconds later the other half gets it. I love seeing awkward freshmen bloom into young adults. I love it when a kids speaks their mind for the first time, when they have really thought a bout a subject and come to their own conclusion. I love that my job makes me want to be a better person everyday. I love that I get to be creative, that I push myself to do better than the day before. I love my VP who works his ass off , and checks in on the teachers, I love our guidance counselors who bend over backwards to get kids services, and make sure they meet graduation requirements. I love going to the beach on a random tuesday during the summer with a book. Teaching is an amazing important beautiful wonderful job, I feel like the luckiest girl in the world somedays  




 My first year I put in 12 plus hour days most days and worked weekends, but I had 3 preps so I always figured that was the reason 




 I have 3 in my classroom, but I teach high school. When kids look sleepy or figdety during class I will ask them to sit on the ball, I have lap desk that go with them. Students love to grab them when we do partner or group work, overall very successful I will buy more next year
 




 I very rarely drink coffee but when I do I take it black, simply because I don't want to try and figure out the suger cream ratio. Because if I am drinking coffee I am too tried to think. 




 Math science and sp ed get forgiveness and can teach anywhere , anyone else can get forgiveness if they teach in a high need area meaning a title one school.  




 Yes as a teacher this is true. Kids mix up numbers and letters all the time it is no big deal at 5.If you are concerned about how the teacher is working with your child call the school and ask to come observe for  a day. 




 Always pee before...always  




 Just breathe and know it will get better. Sorry for your pain 




 Allure salon, if you are more into pretty long hair, article 5 salon if you want something more funky , both are on king street. 




 I am teaching honors US history for the first time I have been giving my honors kids additional assignments, but I don't feel like I am giving them a deeper understanding of the subject. Any advice would greatly appreciated. 




 I teach at a small high school most teachers have 3 or 4 preps , but yes a new teacher should never have more than 2 




 We had a first year teacher this year with 4 preps and no prior education experience. I think he had a degree is bussiness and was teaching marketing type classes. He quit 6 weeks in he didn't realized what teaching would be like and   he didn't have the skills or support to push through it. It isn't for everyone, that guy was a smart, good guy who will be great at someone's company he just wasn't meant to be a teacher. The same way that I would probably crash and burn at a marketing firm. What others have said is helpful too take a day off ask for help, see what is on teachers pay teachers on days when you are overwhelmed with planning. It gets easier , but if you don't like it and it,s making your life miserable then getting a routine down isn't going to make you love it all of the sudden. Best of luck whatever you decide to do. 




 Maybe adding a bit more sugar would help with the yeastyness and help them produce more fluff. Just an idea, sometimes it helps when I make vegan bread.  




 For clarification, I wasn't suggesting that they were the same thing I was posing a question more about people's attitudes toward them. The vast majority of people now think slavery is wrong , I was asking if people might also feel that way about eating meat in the future. 




 This is a well.thought out responce. I teach US history, we are doing a unit on slavery and there are just so many parallels . Especially how abolitionists were seen as extremist, and mocked for their beliefs. I think that the move towards veganism will happen out of necessity of saving resources, rather than moral issues. But who knows the movement is gaining traction everyday and it is becoming more mainstream, so here is hopping. 




 Let me know how it goes 









 He looks like frank from donnie darko 




 Wake up at 6 at school by 7 class from 830 til 4 leave school at 6pm come home eat dinner grade or tweak lesson plans for an hour or so ...go to bed at 10 




 I teach us, government , and economics. For government check out the following websites I am on a mobile or I would link them icivics, the national archives, the library of congress and cspan. Start my government classes off with a news clip and we discuss the governments role in it. For us and world check out the reading like a historian website, they have some good lessons, also check with your media center to see if the have dbqs that you can use. Contact the socail studies person from your district and ask them to come observe you one day and give you some suggestions. I do a lot of hands on stuff but it kind of just comes to me as the year goes on. I had world students hold 30lbs and take a lap aroynd the room to simulate armor that a night wore. I had boys and girls put on high heals when we talked about foot binding. In us I have them make artifacts from the 13 colonies out of play dough, they build shanty towns out of cardboard boxes when we study the great depression, we simulate trench warfare when we study WW I . For govermnet you can run simulations of passing a bill by breaking students into groups and having them vote and make changes as they see fit. Hope that helps a bit, I didn't have much help my first year trust your judgment, experiment some days will be awesome sometimes it will be an epic failure, but you monitor and adjust and move forward. 




 What subjects do you teach?  Are you the only history teacher in the school? Part of your department head's job is to help you grow also reach out to other teachers in general they can give you some ideas you can tweak , good teaching practices can be applied to most subjects. 




 This most people know I am vegan , but will forget and offer me something non vegan I just say no thanks a 9 times out of 10 they remember why I don't want it and apologize. My friends are really accepting of my diet. 




 Omg I haven't had biscuits and gravy in so long thanks for posting 




 I am very lucky in the fact that I never much cared for steak, but if I smell a chicken biscuit or mac and cheese my mouth waters . I am from the south after all. 









 A high quality stapler, it sounds silly but it makes a world of difference.  




 As a graduate from the citadel, it is his class ring, the class ring at the citadel is more than just a ring it is proof you made it through four crazy difficult years. It opens many doors, cadets look out for each other it is a political tool for most graduates . Cadets always wear their ring , the school actually pays for 51% of it so if you disgrace the school they can legally take your ring away from you. 




 I have dyslexia and they look exactly the same to me 




 I teach high school and I convinced my students that Bill Nye the science guy name was really Bill Nye the science man.  




 Can confirm was a bartender for 6 years a rocks pour is 2.0 or larger depending on where you work, so it cost a bit more. 




 I find the difference of ideas between the founding fathers fascinating especially Jefferson and Hamilton. Ben Franklin was a bit of a scoundrel, so talking about him and peppering in some funny antidotes about his personal life would keep the lecture interesting. Like others have said know your audience.
 
























 This going to be lost in all the responses but you asked if anyone had met someone they saved and I have. I worked an overnight shift and got a call from an older woman who had already taken a bunch of pills but didn't want to be alone when she died through out our call I could tell she was starting to fade but I was able to piece together enough information to find out where she was EMS was able to get there in time and save her. 6 months went by and I got a call from the same woman ( it is by coincidence that she connected with me and not another volunteer) she didn't know it was me either . she told me her story and said that the person she talked to saved her life and she had gone to therapy and was doing much better. It made my year and it made all the rough nights worth it.  




 I have a 90 minutes but you could do it as a wrap up the day after you explain the great depression . I only give them 20 minutes to build and you could have them write the letter for homework 




 Love the x o simulation can't wait to try this 




 Since you are about to do the great depression one of the things I do is collect tons of cardboard boxes break the class into "families" and have them build hoses in a hooverville . they also have to wait in the bread line for a fun sized m ms to split with their family. They also apply for jobs to try and get out of hooverville . after we clean up I have them write letters to hoover  about what they think he could do to better their situation . The kids love the simulation and it gives them insight into the frustration of the depression. 




 When he is yawning I stick my finger in his mouth it ruins the yawn . he gets so agitated he has now started covering his mouth with one hand and has the other ready to swat just in case 




 I am a teacher so I have summers off to travel ,but before that I worked as a bartender would save up during the busy season and take time off in the slow season.  




 My boyfriend isn't vegan but he supports my choice. He eats vegan meals I make and even cooks some of his own. He has started eating less meat since we have been together. He pretty much saves it for holidays or nice restaurants. I appreciate the changes he has made and I have never pushed him to do any of it. Vegans get a bad rap for being pushy and judgmental. I often find the best way to get someone to try going vegan is to lead by example. With all that being said it sounds like your husband has a strong aversion to you being vegan, have you two discussed this? Why does it bother him if you were  vegetation before? 




 Yeah he was not from the south. Its been a few years but I think he was from the UK.  




 geechee is a creole language it is also called Gullah it is spoken by some of  the  African-American population living on the Sea Islands and in the coastal region of the US states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and northeast Florida. 




 Ok so this didn't happen to me but a girl I worked with who happened to be African American , we were working at a restaurant in the historical part of charleston SC. this guy had been on a tour earlier in the day and had heard that many people of african decent still speak geechee. He demanded that his waiter speak to him in geechee she informed him that she didn't speak geechee. He told her "you don't have to be embarrassed I won't think less of you, you're black so I know you speak it". He was asked to leave, but couldn't see what the big deal was "I was just asking her to speak the way she does with her friends and family". 









 This had me cracking up I had never heard of willam belli before. 




 I was raised by my dad and learned to do make up almost exclusively through youtube , I was wondering if MUA wanted to share their favorite tutorials. 




 I would advice you to wait until you are in love  for the first time . if you are already dating and you like him what's a few more months to see if you fall in love. Having sex can bring up a lot emotions weather it is your first time or your hundredth . my first boyfriend in high school tried to get me to have sex when we weren't in love but I wanted to wait he  ended up cheating on me with someone who would have sex with him a month later. I was so happy I didn't have sex with him. The next guy I dated I did fall in love with and we had sex and I never regretted it. Just some food for thought as others have said take precautions if you decide to sleep with him. 




 Yeah that was part of it but remember she kept trying to get him to define his sexuality. I think she was on the fence and the spin the bottle game put her over the edge. 




 There was an episode of sex in the city where Carrie had a bi boyfriend he was portrayed realistically and in a positive way. But Carrie couldn't handle dating a bisexual and left him at a party with no explanation ( wtf )  




 I am a teacher and personally I would find it odd to date a former student mostly because they are so immature. But my mom was a former student at the high school my dad taught at. He never taught her but he knew her as a student they were 5 years a part and started dating a year after she graduated. Granted this was in the 70s but they got married and had 2 kids so it depends on the situation and the people. 




 My old roommate and I went through student teaching together I was placed at a rough inner city school he was placed at one of the best schools in the state. He had mostly honors classes I had all college prep. When we talked about our days and our lessons he seemed to be doing so much better than I was . he was having discussions about readings he had assigned and having the kids do projects and papers with little assistance from him. I was working my ass off to teach vocabulary and basic ideas. My kids were less motivated they had less support at home they had less resources. I loved my students though they did learn just not at the pace of my roommates students. When we finished I got a job at another tough school and he got a job and a suburban school were he had less honors classes he called me a lot asking for tips and pointers. Having kids who are unmotivated and disrespectful is challenging. Here are the things that work for me . 1 break everything down into 15 min chunks . teach a concept for 15 min then have them practice with it for 15 min then on to a new concept. 2 I find it is helpful to have one activity per class done as partners because it give the kids a structured break they have to finish an assignment but they can also talk. Remember that some kids lack the mental endurance to stay focused for long periods of time. 3 get to know them as people not just students. What do they do outside of school? where do they live ?who are their friends ? Tell them about you too. I tell my kids little stories from my life like how I didn't sleep the night before because my neighbors had a party. Or  that my grandma is sick and it makes me sad. I let them see me as human and because I opened up about little things they started opening up about big things. 4 get involved in extra curricular activities I coach basketball sponsor a club and facilitate an academy it gives me time with them outside the class room which is where building a strong relationship is so much easier. It will get easier just don't give up you will find what works with your kids it may just be different than what worked before.

 




 We met at a bar and I thought he was nice and funny so I gave him my number. We had a good first date the conversation was good but I wasn't blown away or anything. Our second date I met up with him and some of his friends he was buzzed when I got there and proceeded to get real drunk. He was all over me telling me how hot I was and how cool I was and we hadn't even kissed yet and it really weirded me out. I went home and told my roommate (  a guy) that I was done with him. For some reason he talked me into going on another date with this guy and I did because he made a valid argument that everyone has slipped up and done something silly while drunk. A couple dates later he was so nice funny and smart I realized that our second date was a fluke and he was a good guy. On our 4th date he got an eyelash off my cheek and told me to make a wish then when I went to blow it off his fingers he kissed me and I was surprised at what a good kisser he was . we have been together for over a year and he makes me happy every day.  




 Thanks I will search it out on google 




 I live in a very rural area and don't have much access to vegan convenience food. My grocery store carries tofu and almond milk and that's about it. I would love to make my own vegan yoghurt, and was wondering if anyone had one that they liked that wasn't too complicated. 




 Where is this I teach us history and would love to take my students on a field trip here 




 I work at a title 1 school we hired a first year teacher this year and she is not working out for various reasons. administration is trying to get her to resign so they can hire someone from the December job fair. She is not resigning because leaving mid year looks worse than not being renewed. However talk to your admin and see if they would work with you , our administration was willing to let her resign for "health reasons". She still said no but depending on your administration they might be willing to work out a similar deal with you. 




 You are very attractive . you are exotic but you also have a guy next store quality.  




 Sometimes teaching is like planting bamboo, you plant the seed you do every thing right you water you fertilizes and you wait and nothing happens... for years. and then one day all that careing and nurturing pays off and the bamboo springs out of the ground and starts growing a foot a day. Keep at it you are having more impact than a test can measure. 




 Try the national suicide prevention website , or calling 211 if you are in the US they can provide referrals for all sorts of things. 




 Perhaps I can help with this I used to work at a suicide hotline and I now work as a high school teacher. Honestly the best thing you can do after a suicide for your students in acknowledge that it happened and that you are open to talking about it or letting kids go to guidance if they need to.  Be honest about your feelings but be careful not to glorify suicide. I talk to my students about seeking help for mental illness and let them know I won't judge them if they are having issues. I keep cards with various crisis hotlines on them at the back of my classroom and encourage students to take them. I have had a few students in the past who have reached out to me when they were in crisis and I was thankful that they felt safe enough to do that. I then made sure that they were linked up with resources like counseling or social services. Best of luck so sorry for your loss. 




 Omg  a I hate the hand on the head push down, it is an automatic time out and discussion about sexual boundaries. ..

Unless we are role playing then its hot.  




 My SO have anal sex every couple months, and here are the things that helped me: 1) you need lots lf foreplay, you need to be really horney in order for it to be enjoyable, 2) if your SO takes a while to cum make sure that he is like 80% there before he penetrates you in the beginning you probably wont want to go for more than a couple minutes, 3) let him finger your bum while you have regular sex, it takes some of the stigma away and helps you to relax. If that is enjoyable then continue on to penetration 4) Use lube and go slow once he gets in just have him stay there for a bit with out trying to pull it back right away. Have him play with your clit or nipples (perhaps bring your vibrator) to keep you aroused because it can be uncomfortable , then when you feel like your mussles have relaxed let him know it is ok for him to make small movement and then go from there. Communication is key and don't be afraid to say I want to stop now or I don't think I like this. You should never do something sexually purely for the other person. Anal isn't for everyone I enjoy it from time to time but it took some practice. Hope this is helpful. 




 Stuggled with ED for years , weed and therapy got me through the worst of it . If you ever need a friend my inbox is open. Keep working at it, it gets easier and when you are strong enough throw away your scale. 




 Bartend, I can see where they were coming from and I am sure they had other qualified candidates, but it always hurts to hear you aren't getting a job because you are trying to better yourself. 




 This is from the other side I was applying for a bartender postion had great references and years of experience interveiw was going great until they found out I was getting my master's degree. Said they wanted someone long term apparently the 2 years it takes to get your degree wasn't long enough. 




 My SO just got into pa school, I want to get him something fantastic, so what is something you love as a PA. 




 Haven't tried overlays , but I find highlighting and bolding words helps.me when looking at typeface for some reason. 




 When I was learning to read I basically just sight read everything. I knew what the word looked like to me and that works about 90%of the time , new words are were I get tripped up. Once someone points out what the word is then I can see it (ive heard this happens with people who are color blind too) the type face doesn't eliminate all the elements of dyslexia but it helps bring the word into focus, for me. I wish the best for your daughter let me know if I can answer any questions for you. 
























 I would crack up if my kids built catapults. Sound like a fun teacher  




 It really does! my students and I had a long conversation about it the other day after class and few of them said they would try to vegetarian for a couple weeks and see how it goes. Never preached about it just lead by example and answered their questions  




 We had a swing set with a little platform that you climbed up so you could go down the slide. I used to sit up there and play with my toys. About twice a month I would fall off backwards (5feet) and get the wind knocked out of me. I still can't explain how I always feel off of this thing. 




 I just made this mistake I am all red and broken out. Do you have any suggestions to help my skin heal? 




 I think it is a Scottish fold cat 




 Take a cotton ball with viniger to it  that should help break down the glue 




 Damn and here I was feeling bad that I only see my SO every three weeks. I am sorry for your loss of dick my dear. 




 I live in the southern US and sandals are completely acceptable (and considered professional) as long as they aren't flip flops.  




 This is some frank underwood shit 




 Bus boys typically get tipped out by servers so yeah it would be cheaper to have bus boys , but fun to have dogs 




 It was pretty much like bartending anywhere else except I wore a corset.  




 It was kind of a kink themed club  




 I agree with you I try to eat healthy but tofurky and vegan cheese are great to have around when I just want to make a sandwich for lunch. I recently moved close to a grocery store that has tons a lot of  vegan options and it makes staying vegan so much easier. 




 I actually used to bartend at a club called restraint. So yes. 




 Yes ,thank you that is what I meant to say . it was early and I was on my mobile. But yeah bus boy dogs would be awesome!  




 What of instead of bus boys, restaurants just had trained  dogs you fed scraps to, and then they took the plates back to the dish washer.
Edit spelling and stuff 




 There is no pain quite like "I spent an entire class on this and you still didn't get it" pain. I feel for you. 




 Same thing happened to me had to get off the stuff . I called it orthotripsyco. 




 It takes a couple shark weeks to get the hang of it but I have been a convert for 2 years now and I love it! Good luck. 




 I have a huge book of page protectors and everyone contains everything I used when I taught the lesson the year before and if something didn't work well or I thought of something better to do I write it on the front of the notes for the day. Works well for me.  




 The miseducation of Lauren Hill...one of the few albums I bought new and still listen to regularly. I love every damn song 




 I play an instrument 




 Hanks or coast have great seafood fleet landing is OK hymans is a tourist trap 




 The part of the brain that controls your feet is beside the part of the brain that controls sexual attraction ...just something to think about.
Actually my psyc professor told me this I have never looked to see if it is actually true. 




 I worked while I student taught and it was awful but it is possible. Do as much on the weekends for your job as possible because you will likely be too tired during the week. Let your mentor teacher know you are working . I also took out a small additional student loan so that I could cut back to 15 hours a week every other week which helped me not feel so burnt out. 




 I won teacher of the year as a second year high school teacher. 




 Are you talking about primary sources? I am a little confused about what expository writing means. Reading like a historian has great lesson plans for US and world  history. Hope that is helpful. 




 I am nearing the end of my second year and I am starting to have more of a life work balance my friend who are in their 3rd and 4th years say they do very little at home. 




 I too can go without oral and enjoy other types of sex and my bf is very good at it. I just don't enjoy being eaten out that much. Bet your man feels the same way fuck the internet sometimes. 




 If you do this I think it would be great if you did it kind of like crash course and had different videos for different teachers. Like teachertube secondary teachertube middle and teachertube elementary. I would have loved this my first year ! Let us know how it goes 




 I interviewed for jobs in Asia a couple years ago before taking a job in the states. a couple questions that were different from standard teacher interview questions  were how do you plan to adjust to culture shock? How would you handle language barriers with children? How long do you intend to stay in the country?  Everything else seemed pretty standard I was offered the job but decided to stay in the states. 




 What subject are you interviewing for? 




 Ginger dread man 




 Not a sex Ed teacher but a high school teacher one of my students had heard that if you took ear wax from your ear and put it near a girls vagina that if she had an std she would pull away from it and if she didn't she wouldn't move. He wanted to know if this was true ...I asked him to repeat the question like three times because I couldn't believe how dumb it was. I informed him of the many ways to test for STDs and that was not one of them.  




 I didn't tell her it was me because I didn't want to start crying . I told her that I would pass the message a long to the right person and thanked her for calling to let us know she was doing better. 
























 I have a similar situation at my school, I can make recommendations but a parent can override me. I have a student who is intelligent enough to do the work but has no work ethic he will make a c in my class. He will fail ap English and make a cs and bs  in his other classes . we have all recommended he take cp next year but his dad insist he take honors class. It sucks because it really throws the who dynamic of the class off. 




 Hahaha that's fantastic 




 I have a masters degree a great job stable relationship several interesting hobbies I probably smoke less than the average ent  but I still smoke. Rarely drink life is good happy 4/20 




 I think baby sunscreen has an obvious white cast so parents can see where they apply it 




 When someone says irregardless  I kind of hate them . it isn't a real word and if I correct you I am a dick 




 We have a winner take all system meaning that if one guy gets 49%of the vote and the other guy gets 51% then he gets the seat in congress for his district. So smaller parties never have a chance to win a portion of the seats like they do in other countries. Also the bigger parties often take the ideas of smaller parties so there is no need to vote for them. 




 Man that sucks sorry you had such a bad time with them. I lived across the street from them when they opened up on spring street and was so sad when they moved to King street.  




 Black bean has some good wraps and some of the best vegan cookies in town . it isn't amazing but good for a quick bite. 




 Hey fellow Charleston vegan couple of places to check out delz up town,  black bean co, co Asian restauraunt, octobachi, fig and Macintosh have great veggie plates and butcher and bee mez plate is great too. Let me know if you have any questions .  




 In a similar situation needed to read this so badly because some days I feel like the distance will never end. 




 Depending on where you live tour guide could be a viable option. Camp counselor during the summer and somewhere like they boys and girls club during the year. Or you can try and sub it out for another year. Best of luck. 




 I went to an eating disorder clinic many years ago not as a vegan but as a vegetarian. When I checked in I was allowed to list 3 things I wouldn't eat I chose chicken beef and pork (I figured they wouldn't serve much fish and I was right) after three days of complying with the menu they gave me I was allowed to  choose the foods I wanted as long as they met my dietary requirements so I actually never ate meat while I was there had yoghurt a couple times and eggs once when I didn't get to choose. I hope this helps put you at ease a bit . I have been in recovery for 6 years its a hard battle but I am much happier now than I was back then. If you want to talk inbox me. 




 Yeah my family stopped asking after about 10 years crazy that it takes a decade for your family to take you seriously. I always think , if I had changed my diet to lose weight and lost 50 lbs would they ask if I had gotten fat yet?  




 The same thing happened to me ...its be 17 years so not just a phase I suppose . 




 Opportunity cost is it worth it to loose the person you are with to experiment? It may be but it might also do a lot of damage. I feel like some times my bisexuality starts kicking in when I am unhappy in my current relationship and instead of dealing with it I start fantasizing about the sex I am not with.  I am very happy with who I am dating now and even though I have attraction to both sexes it isn't something I want to act on. Not saying this is what is going on with you but just thought I would share my experience. 




 Your options would probably to bus tables at a restaurant and work your way up. Unless you know someone it is unlikely they will pay you to learn to be an electrian . Charleston is a popular city and jobs can be difficult to come by especially down town. In the city a one bedroom will run you 700$ to 1200$. Their is a party scene here so if you are looking to grow up it also might not be the best place. Not trying to be negative but just trying to be honest. Best of luck what ever you decide. 




 OK sorry didn't mean to step on toes 




 Unfortunately sex Ed usually falls to PE teachers instead of science teachers. So there is a gap in knowledge .  




 Its pretty common to make jokes in any stressful situation. It bands people together and makes the stress more manageable. Its called gallows humor , not soulless completely normal human reaction . 




 I am currently cf and have always kind of been neutral about it. I never desperately wanted kids and I never felt like I would hate having them  either. I kind of always thought well if it happens it happens. So when were you sure you didn't want kids? 




 Letters mean more than you can imagine, they are by far my favorite gift! I had a student give me a book that they thought I would enjoy which was really sweet as well. Congrats on graduation I am sure your teachers are proud. 




 This is actually a great interview question because it gives you insight into someone's knowledge of what is acceptable behavior for the work place 




 Oh I thought he was talking about a section hike . Yes find a person who can care for your pets for that length of time.  




 You could pay a neighbor to take care of them (this is what I do) they already live right next door so it isn't too inconvenient, and they can make some cash. Or you could pay to board them in a kennel.  




 I read a little history of the world and watched some crash course us and world history videos to brush up on some of the things I hadn't studied in a while. Wasn't too bad look at the practice test it was very similar to the actual test. 




 Yes people need to be their own advocate , but just like asking someone who you don't know is pregnant if they want to sit is a bit uncomfortable , so is asking someone to give up their seat so you can sit. 




 Yes you should give up your seat to anyone who is in need... pregnant, elderly, disabled, here take my seat. For no other reason than it is the right thing to do. You can not like kids and still like people. And I am sure I will get down voted to hell for saying this but sometimes this sub is less about being child free and more about hating kids. I like kids I don't have them because I like my freedom more . pregnancy is difficult for most women and if I can ease someone's suffering a bit by standing on the metro then I will. 




 For anyone who is interested in a non harmful way to trap  a mouse I used something like this when I was in Africa a few years ago http://m.instructables.com/id/Simple--No-Kill--Mouse-Trap/ 




 I thought it was a museum but I wasn't sure. I just think it is so cool that they left them up and the little flower garden on the other side is so sweet. 




 You look lovely, so fresh and dewy.I have been using their powder for years and love it but now I am in my late twenties and it started setting I to my fine lines. I just bought the liquid foundation and it still has the same glow and doesn't break out my sensitive skin.  




 It is beautiful but I have always found plantations to be off putting because of all the suffering that took place there.  




 There is this park right at the corner of Calhoun and Rutledge (Cannon Park)  it has these amazing columns that are left over from a building that burned down it is really beautiful and not a typical Charleston proposal spot.   




 This made me so happy ! I think that is such a creative solution.  




 That's kind of what I have going right now and it works OK. I was actually thinking about getting a small tackle box to put everything in , but it just seems really bulky 




 Hey MUA I have been following this sub for a while and my make up skills and collection have greatly improved. I was wondering if anyone has a make up bag that they love. I travel pretty regularly and would like something that can hold most of my make up but isn't huge. Any advice would be great.
