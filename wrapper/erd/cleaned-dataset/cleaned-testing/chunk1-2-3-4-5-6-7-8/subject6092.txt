 Hey I had one of these once, used it at BK and the cashier just looked at it for about 10 seconds!  




 Put a mustache on it 




 Norwich is great for exploring! We have tons of stuff! 




 It sounds like someone who isn't into bisexual girls. I mean take what you want from it, but it's me. My profile said something similar to "I'm intimidated by bisexual girls." I got rid of it, but I never once said I'm not scared of anyone who has had homosexual relationships. Me saying I'm intimidated is my way of saying I would be nervous to be with a girl who has been with other girls. If you want to be uptight and get offended by this then so be it. Saying that just because I have my profile set to straight girls only is a sign I may have other "illogical beliefs" is the most ridiculous thing I've heard in a while. Why don't you bring this up with okcupid who has that setting allowed? Do something constructive with how you feel instead of targeting one person. That's the problem with a lot of people these days. So many would rather harass someone over something silly than actually do something about it.  




 Sounds good, I'll take care of it. Thank you! 




 Nothing, honestly. It's just I don't know how I would feel dating a bisexual girl. It certainly isn't homophobic, but if you feel like it is then that's fine.  




 Well if someone was reading my profile first before going into the detail section I would think they would remember I'm in college. 




 I'll take it. Thank you!  




 Thanks. I deleted a few pictures and and I'll try to get more real pictures. 




 College student working part time. Sorry. 









 Nice!

 I get severe goosebumps whenever I see a trailer for this movie!  




 What sort of beautiful display can you make out of butt plugs?  




 I always say sorry and laugh when I do this 




 Shit happens.  




 I feel good when something on WTF makes me want to vomit.  




 Damn it... You're right! Success comes from mistakes though, and I am excited for these new successes!  




 So happy this guy never left! Shabazz you're a UCONN hero, win or lose!  




 Haha I really hope that we are relevant. With MCW and a healthy Noel(fingers crossed) all we need is a legit scorer and we should be relevant! 




 FUCK THE NEW JERSEY NETS AND THE BOSTON CELTICS AND THE NEW YORK KNICKS! 76ERS ALL DAY MOTHERFUCKER! FEEL OUR WRATH IN 2 YEARS THUNDERCUNTS!  




 Most beautiful city I've ever been to. 




 Explain that all that beastiality porn is for science! 

Edit: bestiality. I'm keeping the original and thank you for the correction!  




 Pass out in a comfortable chair. 




 I sleep for 23 hours. 




 I would guess it sort of depends on where you live and what your career is in.  




 I think you mean Kabletown. 




 Wow. I never noticed that they're the same person. What a world! 




 So I notice that a lot of girls say don't send me a message saying just "Hey", give it some effort. Every single first message I have received from a girl has been a simple "Hey" or a variation of hey such as "Hey cutie" or "Hi". What's up with this double standard? Why can girls say hey, but males get shunned for saying hey? 




 Good man. Good luck tonight and here's an up vote to you having a wonderful life with her! 




 You know why you want to marry this person?  




 I would say CT is a solid 25th best state in the country.  




 I'll try to get more non selfies. It's tough, I don't like pictures. 
Also that's an anchorman quote... I feel like it's amazing. 




 I've had this account for awhile now. This is account number two actually. My username is drannen126, I'm just looking for some constructive feedback! Thanks! 




 Yeah true. I might as well make some banter when I see her randomly. It's the thought of talking to a person I don't know. Once I do it I'm fine.  




 Well... you know... that would involve me...  having confidence... which I don't have. 




 Just take it super slow this time of year. I try not to get involved with people in December, January and February. I just don't like the idea of spending money on a person I haven't been together with for a decent amount of time.  
I'll still chat people up during these months, but I'll take it slow and just keep my options open. Don't totally become a hermit. Just be that neighbor who talks about the weather when you're both picking up your newspaper.  




 Oh, I will.  




 I'm glad I saw this thread. I work next to a Target and there is this girl I see on OKCupid and she also works at Target. I'm nervous to message her because I go to Target almost everyday and I want to avoid being awkward. Screw it. I might go and message her now! 




 I saw this while taking a dump before a class at my college. 





























 This girl liked me on okcupid, so I checked her profile out and she was great. Looked like she knew what she was doing in life, was really beautiful and we had a few likes in common. So I message her and no luck. Similar things have happened with 3 girls in the past night alone. I try not to get hung up in one person, but it's sometimes so confusing. Do you guys/girls have any messaging tips?  




 Well this outbreak has been going on almost year long and it just became news recently. Yeah you're right though. 




 It isn't. The genetic code is 97% similar, but I haven't seen many places refer to it as the ebola strain. That doesn't change anything I said though.  




 I said there is a very small chance it would spread to someone through a sneeze. If someone sneezed directly on you that's different. If you're in a room with someone who has ebola and they sneeze, you have a small chance of catching it. What I said was not false information.  




 Yeah I think you're right, but I wouldn't suggest being in contact with much urine regardless haha. 
It's really good that people are aware this is happening now, but more people need to understand how little of a risk first world nations face.  




 Healthcare workers get infected because they aren't always trained up to first world standards in Africa. Some of the doctors are great over there some of them aren't. Ebola patients require 24/7 monitoring and are often stressful patients to work with. A lot of them get sick because they don't always properly clean rooms or isolate patients. If this were a flu you should be slightly worried. Ebola is held to mainly villages and quite frankly village people can't afford to fly over to the US or any first world nation. I wouldn't even be worried if I was working in Penn station. Now my knowledge of this is limited to my schooling. I'm going to school hoping to work for the CDC when I graduate so I only know this from what I've read and learned. I have 0 hands on experience with ebola. It does sound like an experimental cure has been very successful down in Atlanta. Avoid bodily fluids and you will be fine. What I've learned is to get people educated on the disease they're worried about and get them away from ignorance. Ebola isn't a big risk. 




 That's good because you can literally worry yourself sick. I'm glad I can help! Stay healthy!  




 There is a very little chance it would. It isn't a respiratory illness so there's a very small chance of that. If there is blood in the sneeze, it's a little higher of a chance if the blood touches you. I wouldn't worry about a sneeze. If someone pisses on you, shits on you, bleeds on you or vomits on you be worried. It really only spreads to family members, village members and health care workers. If you see anyone who looks like they have the flu, avoid them. Which I think is just common sense. Ebola starts off with flu like symptoms, then progresses rapidly. Don't worry about ebola unless you've come into contact with someone from west Africa or someone who just came from west Africa if they are sick. Very little reason to be worried. I cannot stress that enough. 




 The way it spreads shouldn't worry someone unless you eat bushmeat or are directly caring for someone with ebola. It doesn't spread easily. It's spreading because family members try to care for those infected with ebola. It wouldn't spread much in a developed country. You should only worry about your safety if you're dealing with a sick person who just came from west Africa or was in contact with someone from west Africa. Even if you don't live in a very developed country you shouldn't worry about it. Avoid those who are sick and throwing up. Don't touch urine, blood, saliva, feces and other bodily fluids that aren't your own. There really is no reason to panic about ebola. A flu panic is something that's reasonable in a developed nation. Ebola is not.  




 Ebola Zaire which isn't responsible for this outbreak kills 90%. This one is 60-70% which is still nasty. A lot of people are freaking out because of how fast it is spreading for an ebola outbreak and how long it is lasting. People jump to ill-advised conclusions that it might be airborne now, but it's surely not. The outbreak would be larger than it is now. This outbreak is spreading at this rate and for this long because it isn't killing that quickly for an ebola strain so more people can come into contact with an infected person. No need to panic if you're in a wealthy country or outside of Africa. 




 Ebola can still spread for about 2 months after infection via semen. I would advise he doesn't have sex for 2 months after he's 100%.  




 You shouldn't worry about getting ebola unless you plan on coming in contact with a sick individual's bodily fluids. This ebola strain is very similar to the Ebola Zaire which means it is very unlikely it's airborne. This strain is spreading faster because it is killing a smaller number of people than the Zaire strain. I believe the Zaire strain killed 90% of infected, this one is killing roughly 65% of infected. 
Unless it becomes airborne don't worry. 
If for any reason you believe you could be sick, stay hydrated and see a medical professional.  




 That I'm a very angry Jewish person.  




 Reston ebola, it didn't spread to humans though. 




 Exactly this. Vaccine companies wouldn't make enough profit considering all the work that would need to be done. Sadly creating a vaccine is only going to happen if profits will be made. The big buyers are going to be from first world nations and quite frankly, ebola poses little risk in those nations at the moment. The demand is simply too little for who is going to be able to buy it. Vaccine creation would take some time also. It doesn't exactly happen overnight.  




 DUDE SAME! Except I did mine in 10th grade. It's exciting. It's almost an adrenaline rush when I see these updates. It's like a movie with real consequences. It hurts to think that people suffer mightily from ebola, but we must understand suffering is something that happens. I've read books on infectious disease since I was like 13 and I want to try to do work for the CDC when I finish my education. I don't really want to see this become a huge pandemic, but the thought of living through one is exhilarating. If it spreads worldwide I pray everyone to have the best luck. Maybe better sanitary conditions can prevent it in western countries, but maybe they won't. We don't really know how powerful ebola could be. We might be on the brink of witnessing it's potential.  




 Do you think FIFA would fine countries football programs or players who said they would choose to not play in this World Cup?  




 Made me think of Larry David 




 Maybe she asked out of pity 




 Really? Two years ago a banker came into a class of mine and was telling us that identity fraud was incredibly tough to prove. What a douche bag trying to bait potential criminals. Thank you for teaching me the correct thing, not that I would ever break the law like that. 

Edit: somehow identity turned into indentured...  




 I heard fraud is one of the hardest crimes to actually get caught for  




 I think OP watched Die Hard with a Vengeance on AMC yesterday.   




 As someone moving to brookyln soon I'm glad I saw this thread. I would think walking around looking bummy would work. That was going to be my strategy until I got more accustomed to the city. 




 Hey I've been home for about an hour now, to find that my roommate ate the last of my food. A pizza right now would be spectacular.  




 Well now you're just being vulgar.  




 I'll find it, thank you very much!  




 Seinfeld. It's a show about nothing, yet it is very relatable.  




 So striking. 




 What is that drink, is that a sort of coffee? I've never seen it. Where can I get some? 




 Let's address the real issue here: what kind of asshole points out that someone has a boner?  




 Somewhat bad? What the hell does that mean?  




 Ya know, I only get this once in awhile. It's like my dick has selective pissing around other people!  




 Virgin here: masturbation.  




 And the cow says booooo because the joke sucks.  




 Well now people will get so excited they pissed that they will forget to breathe again.  




 I think I would try to drink the screen if I was playing that game!  




 The only faith you really need in a time where you're questioning religious faith is faith in yourself.  




 Relax, you're making pranks out to be some kind of existential crisis. I mean, I follow "live every week like it's shark week" as much as the next guy, but sometimes we need to let the sharks go by.  




 Hey, I feel this way every day. Just try to be happy and positive. You'll be surprised at what this can do. It sucks at first, but you can do it. "Live every week like it's shark week." That's the best advice I've ever heard.  




 Let's keep my faith quiet. I won't use a throwaway though, too much work. What you're going through is common. Just look towards the sky and as long as you can see the sky you have a reason to be happy. 




 You might wanna get that checked out. That is a high level of pranks per day. The cut off is 345. If you're committing more than 345 pranks per day, you have a problem and should seek professional help.  




 Proud of you, bro-man. 




 Yeah man, she's not your ship so don't go with the captain goes down with the ship mentality. That can be painful. Just jump ship. Don't mention it though. Just cut her off. I mean, if you happen to see her say hi, nothing more.  




 Just stop. You're being an unnecessary asshole. Next thing you know the dog is going to be at a shelter because of your little prank.  




 She starts to be curt with her responses in conversation. You can sort of feel a negative vibe coming from the other person when you're texting, at least I think so. 
























 The kid I was playing against has Peyton Manning, Andy Dalton (both on byes) so he picked up Big Ben and Eli Manning (you start 1 QB) and he started Eli. At least he has 2 empty starting roster spots...  




 Started him over Jay Cutler who has been great so far this season... Well not doing that anymore. This kid in our league has 4 QBs too so the QB depth for a backup is light.  




 I have Antonio brown Alshon Jeffry Victor Cruz Marques Colston and Julian Edelman. I found it easy I part ways with sanders and welker  









 Some friends and I were having lunch or dinner on a rainy day at my favorite chain restaurant when suddenly I heard an explosion and a few screams. I looked outside the window and saw some smoke and then heard more explosions and off in the distance I saw a lot of smoke coming from an old factory in the distance with tall smokestacks. The smoke was coming from the building itself and not the smokestacks. More explosions came and suddenly the smokestacks began to crumble down and then it was clear what was causing this. Oddly enough it seemed like fireworks were going off and there were so many of them that it was doing serious damage to this building. Sooner than later the while building was reduced to rubble and the fireworks stopped. After this we left the restaurant and I went to a house where these three girls were. I only recognized the face of one of the girls, but she was the only person of significance in this part of the dream. It was clear that she was interested in making sexual advances with me, but I wasn't taking advantage of them even though in real life I find this girl really attractive. 


I've never had a dream like this where so much happened and I was hoping someone could interpret this or help with an interpretation. I really don't even dream that often - maybe once a month.  A lot of what I think are minuscule details were left out, but if you have any questions let me know! Thank you.  




 Standard ESPN scoring: Sanders (SEA), Welker (SEA) and Colston (MIN). Pick 1. Thank you.  




 It is so crazy! I don't understand Arizona! 




 So I've got my flex options this week between Julian Edelman, Andre Ellington, Mike Asiata and Desean Jackson. It's a standard espn league. I'm leaning Ellington because I think it's clear he will play and provides the most upside.  




 Yeah I try hard to not be that guy. Thanks. 




 Alright,  I'll definitely hang on to him. Thanks.  




 Pick that guy up! 

Edit: I might have made an unintentional pun that could have been taken the wrong way.  









 I would go with Matt Ryan. You've got a beautiful QB situation here though. Can't really go wrong, but I like Matt Ryan more because he's go better targets around him and Cinci seems to give up a lot of yards.  




 The potential of Cruz would be enough to have me start him. Arizona does have a nice secondary, but Cruz is able to light it up if he gets the touches. 




 I would go with Decker. I think he has the better situation around him to score points. 




 Standard espn scoring: Marques Colston vs Cleveland, Julian Edelman vs Minnesota, victor Cruz vs Arizona, desean Jackson vs Jacksonville, Emanuel sanders vs KC,Alshon Jeffries vs San Fran. Pick 2 




 Standard scoring: Locker vs Dallas or Cutler vs San Fran. Seems like Locker is the better bet here, but I would like another opinion.  




 I've been feeling awfully shitty whenever I'm alone or not with people I know. This feeling started at work about 2 months ago and once in awhile I would find myself really in the dumps outside of work, but not too often. The longer time went on I would feel worse and worse outside of work. The last 3 weeks or so it's become so prominent in my life the only time I escape it is when I'm with friends. Even then I get an occasional feeling of hate for myself. I've been getting about 3 headaches a day the past week and I haven't been sleeping well. I've had a shitty appetite and I'm starting to hate everything about myself. It was suggested to me by my HR that I take some time off to try to clear my head. Tomorrow is my first day back in two weeks. Things haven't gotten better and I'm always alone at work. I'm scared to go back. I don't want to. We have a point system there and if you get to 10 you're fired. Work was a trigger for me so I've collected either 8, 9 or 10 in the last 2 months or so. I forgot how many I had so I could be getting fired when I come in tomorrow. I need money and I've applied to new jobs already just in case, but I know if I get fired it will be the most bittersweet thing in my life right now. I would've gotten rid of a large stressor in my life, but I would not have enough money. I'm 20, live with two roommates and go to school. My family is poor and I know they would struggle to support me if I didn't have a job. I have my own bills to pay and I'm really going to be screwed for a bit. All of my friends with the exception of 4 are away for school now and ude to school I won't have much time to see them. I'm scared things are going to get worse and my feelings will only escalate into something that could be troubling. I was recently rejected by this girl that I've still been friends with and tonight a friend went to a fair with her. When I asked that friend what he was doing earlier in the day (I wanted to hang out) he said he just wanted to stay at home tonight. I found out because the girl I like told me that they were going to the fair. That made me feel really shitty. My Mom's birthday was a couple of days ago and I forgot to at least call her. I felt like I was worthless for forgetting. It was 6pm and she texted me and she had to tell me it was her birthday. I really didn't want to live anymore after that text. I'm scared I'm becoming a huge failure and disappointment to myself. I want something bad to happen to me so I die. I know I wouldn't be able to take my own life from myself, but I don't think I would hesitate to try to save myself from anything bad happening to me. I don't see the point in living if I'm just going to feel shitty and scared all the time. I'm becoming extremely irritable, I find myself being quick to judge and then hate other people. I'm becoming an extremely bitter and pessimistic person. I'm seeing a therapist once a week now. I need that to help me. I need a lot right now. 

TL;DR My life feels like a waste, I think I'm becoming a fuck up and I'm scared of my future.  




 As a united fan it cracks me up that both picks are tough ones, but for totally opposite reasons.  




 Hey I sent you a pm. Hope it helps.  




 Thank you 




 No, I just have no idea where to start. 




 So I actually got sent home from my job yesterday because I just felt myself on the verge of breaking down while there and I just couldn't work and I nearly broke down speaking to my manager. The last month and a half or so at work my performance has dropped rapidly without me realizing it and at the same time I've been feeling worse and worse about myself while working. I loved this job and now I just can't focus on doing it. My family has a history of behavioral health problems and that causes my anxiety to increase just by thinking about it. It also doesn't help that this amazing girl I had been talking to suddenly isn't interested even after she basically said she was. 

So today I got up feeling alright about myself and I just go brush my teeth and I just start crying my eyes out. I had been feeling really crappy about myself the last month or so except when I'm around others and I think this rejection was the tipping point. I always think about suicide even when I'm not feeling down on myself, but the past month and half I've thought about it more and more and the last two days it's been all over my mind. I'm usually able to shake off these feelings of despair, but I really don't see any hope in the future and I'm not sure if I want to.  




 Writing is awesome. It's impressive to be good at writing 




 What makes you brilliant? 




 Is that James Franco? 




 It's really tough sometimes though  




 ELI5 




 So this girl I've had a crush on for a whole now recently broke up with her boyfriend about two weeks ago. I've hung out with her a few times since and I'm really getting interested in her. I'm 20 and I'm really awkward when it comes to these situations so I'm not sure how to handle it. I definitely want her to know I'm interested and I've tried to by giving her compliments (not too many), but I really don't want to come on too strong since I've heard her say to her friends she doesn't want to rush into a relationship. I know she doesn't think I'm bad looking and at least as good looking as her ex and we get along great. Ask any questions you all need, I'm appreciative of any help I can get.  














 Lol thanks 




 I sleep nude and I sleep walk 




 Alright I think I can do this. Thanks. 




 Yeah I try to avoid compliments until later on anyways. 




 I stole 3 snicker bars while I was a cashier at my first job. Never caught - I'm a good thief.  




 Brilliant idea! It has slowed down, but it's still happening. I'll give it a week. Thank you! 




 Weird prank  




 And I'm a straight guy. I typically message them back most of the time and try to tell them I'm straight and not interested in the most polite way possible. 

I wouldn't say I'm mad this is going on, it's just a little weird. I've been on OKC for over a year and never had a gay guy visit and in the past week I've had 11 guys like me and 5 message me. My profile still says I'm straight.


Anyone having this same thing happen?  




 I'm really bad at flirting. For me it's normal conversation or making fun of someone slightly.  




 I overthink messages. 




 I was thinking I'm too conservative in my messages. I'm not sure I know how to be flirty!  




 Yeah sounds about right. 




 I go full out on here. I do judge looks first, but then I go deep into the profile and their questions. Yeah, I guess it's not bad to know I'm not ugly... I guess.  




 I ask them about things in their profile and stuff like that. Maybe I just suck at communicating. 
























 I was 16, a couple months from turning 17. My mom, sister, her two kids and myself were going to be evicted. I was going to have to move to a new town and start going to a new high school. It was really scary for me. Then a friend's mom and dad offered to let me live with them so I could still go to the same high school. My mom urges me to do what I thought was best for myself so I went and stayed with that friend's family. I lived their for a year and a half and I've never been more grateful for something. 




 I woke up yesterday in my bed.  




 Step 1. Create an idea that will make sense to some people and will keep that group together.
Step 2. Brainwash that group into believing everything you tell them.
Step 3. Create rituals that are really just bonding experiences for the group. 
Step 4. Do whatever it takes to expand your group/keep it together.

I don't really know how a cult works. 




 Dolphin and a bear.  




 The Social Network soundtrack. I think it's awesome and it's been great at keeping me focused.  




 I think it will be interesting to see what people have to say here.  




 So I'm currently nearing the end of one TV Show and I need to figure out what show I'll watch next. Many one here willing to give me reasons as to why Doctor Who should be next? 




 Hey everyone, I realize this probably won't get too much support, but I think it's worth a try. I'm now three months behind on rent and I would really love to be able to give my landlord at least a month of rent money ($400). I linked my gofundme page here. The goal on that is $1,200, but any donation will be appreciated greatly. Thank you. http://www.gofundme.com/fdjd8c 




 I recently posted trying to get some ideas of ways to make some more money and I would like to thank those who helped! I have some ideas buzzing around to start up a small scale tutoring service at my college and hopefully that helps out a bit. 

Although I have a job I'm not making what I need to make to afford my rent right now. I would love a quick relief for at least a month of rent. My rent is only 400 a month. I fell behind because I had to miss a good amount of work and it sent my life a little out of control. I would love to be able to give my landlord at least 1 month of rent ASAP. My fortunately at this pace I won't be able to pay it all off until sometime in 2015 and who knows if my landlord is going to be forgiving? 

Here is a link to my gofundme, any donation is appreciated no matter how small or generous. Thank you!

 Hey all, I'm in a tough spot when it comes to money and I haven't found much support. I did set up a gofundme, and I got a little money on it from Facebook friends, but that money was really only a little. I'm in college full time, living on my own and I haven't been able to fully pay my rent for three months now and I owe a couple hundred to school. I'm really looking for some ideas to make some money. I tried getting a second job, but the combination of my school schedule and not having a car made that impossible. I recently got over a fight with depression, but I'm worried it's going to come back. Any ideas are welcome, but be serious! 




 Big Ben vs Baltimore or RG3 vs Minnesota? Standard ESPN scoring  




 Cody Parkey vs Houston or Nick Novak vs Miami?  




 Jeremy Hill yes! 




 I hope he returns and plays well, I traded some good assets for him!  




 I have another open roster spot. My team is fine with 3 QBs. I never do this, but it fits my team right now.  




 I didn't know who Andre Ellington was at the beginning of the year. I tend to only care about the players from the team I support or whoever is on my fantasy team. I didn't know he was a beast. My team auto drafted him. I said "who is this guy?" So I traded him. Now I see him doing great and it's like watching a fat ex girlfriend look beautiful and not fat with Leo DiCaprio. I see these stats he puts up and I feel like I'm dying a little bit. I'm 3-5 (3 game winning streak though!) and his owner is 8-0. I'm a normal title contender in this league and I know that if I kept him my team would be in a better position. Mr.Ellington I beg for your forgiveness. Forgive me for my naiveness and impatience. I will live the rest of my life indebted to you if you allow me to make the playoffs in this league. Please, Mr. Ellington. Thank you Red Jesus.  




 This PowerPoint made me sad because I traded Ellington earlier in the year and I wouldn't be able to tell you who I got in return....  




 I have him a my 3rd string QB right now. My team is pretty top heavy so I've got a few expendable bench spots so I figured why not stick him behind Cutler and Big Ben. It prevents him from killing me if he goes to another team and what if he plays out of his mind and out performs Cutler and Big Ben? He's a high risk high ceiling guy and if you have a room for him let him in!   




 Had an open spot so I grabbed him up. Starting QB is Cutler, but my season long backup has been Big Ben. I'm rostering all 3 right now and now I don't know what to do. 




 Smallpox and anthrax 




 Selling Knowshon Moreno for $25 the week before he was placed on IR 




 So I got home from school a few hours ago (I go to community college). I live with two roommates who love to eat my food. I was expecting to make the rest of my spaghetti last until Thursday because I get paid Friday. It was gone when I got home. I get headaches when I'm hungry and they make it really difficult to study and do any work. 
I had to walk home too because I forgot my bus money at home ($1.50 and it's like a 50 minute walk). All I have left is some bread now, but there's a couple pieces left and that won't get me too far.
If someone buys me a nice pizza I'll post it with me smiling and then I will write you an appreciative poem! 
I live in the US and my only option is dominos. Thank you.  




 For my flex spot standard non PPR. Victor Cruz, Odell Beckham JR (vs PHILLY), CJ Spiller (vs NE), Golden Tate (vs MIN) or Julian Edelman (vs BUF). 




 0-5 and giving up the most points in the league. Kid in my league who is 5-0 has scored the 3rd lowest total, but has given up the lowest total by over 100 points.  




 I try to fleece people, but so far I've gotten Demaryius Thomas for Sanders/Welker (kid dropped Welker a week later). One of my friends in my league was telling me that he would get these trade offers of Steven Ridley and Torrey Smith for Calvin Johnson (after his week 1 performance). Oh, Doug Martin, Vincent Jackson and MoJo for Peyton is a trade that happened. Sproles, Kelvin Benjamin, T.Y Hilton and Lamar Miller for Frank Gore and Randall Cobb also happened. Those 3 trades that happened involved the same kid. He's traded away Thomas, Manning, Gore and Cobb in 2 weeks. 

edit: added two trades 




 Yeah and my team is now 0-5. 




 Things are looking a little better. Together we can do this! 




 Who else is playing the Seahawks D/ST and is furious with this Redskins offense? 




 I'm up by 3 points against his owner so I'm hoping for some fumbles and less than 10 yards total. Also the Seahawks D/ST need to not get any turnovers/touchdowns and allow a boatload of points. 
This was the best week of my winless season so far and I really need this! 




 So I've posted here a few times and haven't gotten anything. So I would like to offer a poem to anyone that gets me a pizza meal. I'm in need of a large pepperoni with something to drink. No need to post anything about me, but times are tough I'll leave it at that. I'm not the best at poems, but hey I figured you're giving me a meal! I need to give something in return.  




 I haven't been able to pay my rent for the last few months and for me that is extraordinarily far behind. I'm supposed to be getting money from a car accident case sometime in 2015, but my landlord isn't having it. The money I get from work goes to food and transportation to work/school. I'm 20 years old and I will have no where to turn. My dad lives in Florida (I'm in Connecticut) and we don't talk. My sisters and mom all live together and don't have room for me. I've had to change my life plans recently to try to accommodate me as I am right now, but I might have to change them drastically if I don't get any help soon. I set up a gofundme and a few friends have put some money in. http://www.gofundme.com/fdjd8c is the link to that. I've sold everything I have of value aside from my clothes, phone and laptop. I've tried getting a second job and have been trying for a few months now. If you want more details about how my life is almost ruined you can ask me. Thanks for anything. http://www.gofundme.com/fdjd8c 




 This interests me... How did he start this and how could I start? 









 I need Gronk Seattle D/ST and Harvin to have under 19 points combined!  




 Bell and Jennings. You've got some awesome RB depth for a 12 team.  




 So I need to pick 2 of these guys for a standard espn league. CJ Spiller vs Detroit, Montee Ball vs Arizona, Ben Tate vs Tennessee and Andre Williams vs Atlanta.  




 Well, I'm lucky in that I have a lot of things I'm interested in so I was able to look at what degrees gave me the best chance at getting a job and go off of that. I'm studying microbiology and I want to be a virologist. 




 You people can learn about me.  









 Thank you just set up a gofundme 




 So I'm going to a local community college and living in my own. My mom is broke and actually asks me for money sometimes. The thing is I'm broke too. I had a nice summer job until I was in a car crash, then a month later I spiraled into a stress fueled depression. I've seen a therapist and I've gotten better, but the stress and anxiety is still taking it's toll. I missed work because of that depression and car crash. I fell behind on bills. I couldn't work at that job anymore. I have a new job now and I'm looking for a second. I owe my landlord 
Nearly 1k and my school 230 before I can apply for the spring semester. I missed school full time last year (would've been my sophomore year) because I was stressing out over life. I'm scared it's happening again and I don't want to get stuck in a life without education. I should get money from the car crash in mid-late 2015, maybe later. Any amount of money will help out. I just desperately want to give my land lord some money and be able to pay back my college. If you need any verification I can provide it. Thank you so much.

 Only $2? Can't even get a pizza pizza with that! 

Of course I'm only joking, it's a nice offer!  




 So I made a mistake with my bank account and now I'm $35 poorer than I was and it put me in the negative. I'm in college and I'm used to going until the last dollar is up, but when there's no money what is there to do. I live off campus by myself and I have enough chicken for 2 meals. I would like to save those for Tuesday and Wednesday. Thursday I'm fine - I go out Thursday night after class and one friend pays for us all and I've negotiated switching weeks with him. I was hoping someone could spot me a pizza tonight. Once I get paid I'll go back on here and buy someone pizza. It's only the right thing to do. Thank you! 




 He has 3 backups no one knows 




 Yeah and currently has 2 defenses and 2 kickers and 2 open starter spots  
























 Stafford has megatron back you can't be not excited about that. 




 Oh wow! Good find. you! 




 Stay away from Sanchez. Have trust in Russ. The giants don't have a good secondary. Wilson should be able to expose it. 




 Matty Ice is that guy you need. Especially with those bonuses. Ryan has one problem and that's his offensive line. As long as he can pick up the rush and get it out quick he will have another big game against TB. 




 Peyton is Peyton. You can only debate one QB over him right now and that kid is on a bye week.  




 Romo. Better weapons, weaker opponent and better quarterback. 




 Matt Ryan. Has huge potential for scoring here. Only problem is that offensive line. I like going for ceiling in close decisions like this. I think wilson is safer, but Ryan could score a lot.  




 Yeah I think Denver's D is underrated and Seattle's is overrated. Eli has been solid-good this year and I think he can keep it up. Surprising he hasn't dipped without Cruz. As a giants fan I can only wish Cruz never got hurt.  




 After this week Andre Williams. I just hope no one else grabs him up. 




 I would trust Eli here. I think he can the Seahawks secondary with OBJ. 




 Romo if you're looking for higher ceiling. Better weapons and going against a weaker team I think.  




 Go with Kaep. He was the better matchup with better weapons. It's close though.  




 Stafford. Calvin is back and that Tate/Johnson duo could be amazing. 




 Giants secondary is not good. Wilson will be able to expose it. 




 Orton. He's a much better QB than people think.  




 Vick was seen with a limp. Don't pick him up. Go with Eli. 




 Seattle's secondary is over rated I would go with Eli. 




 3-6 you need to take a risk. Sanchez is so bad in my opinion he's less of a risk and more of a sure failure. Go with Cam. 




 Cutler, yeah he's struggled against the Pack, but he has some damn good weapons.  




 Higher ceiling is Matt Ryan. Better weapons by far. 




 Honestly I like Romo here even with so much going against him. He still has the running game to protect him and Dez Bryant.  




 Stafford. Tate and Calvin on the field at the same time with Stafford and Tate's recent hookups could do wonders for Stafford. 




 Go with Ice. He is going against a weaker defense, he's the better QB and has better weapons. 




 Yikes, I like Carr, but Romo is the better qb even when hurt and has more weapons. It's an even tougher call when you consider that Romo had to travel to London. I go with Romo here. 




 Peyton. Peyton by miles. Andrew Luck is the only quarterback I think you should consider over Peyton.  




 I would go with Wilson. Yeah Matt Ryan had that huge game early in the year, but that was at home. Ryan has more weapons, but significantly less time to use those weapons. I don't think you can go wrong though. 




 Wilson. More skilled in my opinion and going against a worse defense.  




 Wilson, the giants are weak in the secondary and Wilson is the guy who can take advantage of that. 




 I would go with Cam. I think with Romo's injury Cam has much better upside.  




 Martavis Bryant at the Jets or Allen Robinson vs Dallas 




 Thanks, that what I was thinking. 




 Jay Cutler at Green Bay or Big Ben at the Jets 




 Should I drop Travis Kelce for him? 




 Denver at Oakland or Baltimore vs Tennessee? Standard ESPN scoring.  




 Bring Me Down by Kanye 




 We only veto trades that show collusion not one person drastically over valuing a player. It helped that he actually sent me the trade! He told me he wanted Lopez and I told him I wanted a point guard. He offered John Wall.  




 Traded Robin Lopez for John Wall last season 




 This will sound weird, but I definitely think strange clouds and adventures are better albums overall, but for some reason is only like a few songs on it whereas on Underground Luxury I really can listen to a lot of the tracks and really feel and relate to each one on some sort of level.   




 B.o.B isn't a top 5 rapper in my opinion and might be borderline top 15, but I really loved Underground Luxury. It had everything I really could hope for in a modern rap album. I think I'm gonna have to say Underground Luxury, but Illmatic, Food and Liquor and Graduation are certainly up there.   




 Nas 

Kanye West

Lupe Fiasco

 4-5, third in my division going against second place who is 5-4. He has Bernard I have Hill. Looking good! 




 Peyton Manning for Doug Martin in week 5 




 I'm 4-5, riding 4 game win streak. 1 game out of second place in my division. Tied for second place in my division is the Gio owner. I have Hill and I face him this week.  




 Anal Farieds  





























 Eastern standard time  




 Freaking out for you bro. Idk why, but this has me very hot and sweaty 




 Yeah, crazy isn't it? 




 So my girlfriend and I just had sex and the condom broke during it and I came inside of her. She is on birth control and has been for 3 weeks (3rd week just started) and was previously on a different birth control pill for 2 months. We both lost our virginity to each other about a month ago and have already got plan B twice. Should we be worried about her getting pregnant? We are both 21 and in college and do not want a kid or kids at the moment. Thanks for any input. I'm not too worried about it, but she seems a bit shooken up. 




 I know this is a joke, but in my experience a movie is the perfect first date. If the two of you become the couple everyone hates in the theatre because you're talking the whole time, it's a solid sign you guys will work out.  




 Alec Baldwin in 30 Rock. 




 Damn it that almost made me start crying in the library at my school. I had to stop watching with like a minute left.  









 I used to feel this way about it, but I've really started to come around to it and admire looking up at it.  




 Whatever is Spanish for Remember Your Mother 




 It's getting chilly and my stomach wants some pizza. It could warm me up. Thanks. 




 :( 




 Manchester United because they were the first soccer team I ever heard of.
Borussia Dortmund because Reus is my favorite player. 
Bordeaux because I like using them in fifa career mode. 
Roma for same reason as above.
Real Madrid because I like what they're doing over there.  




 The last two episodes (I count the last "two" as one) always get me to tear up. Does anyone else suffer from this? It seems a bit ridiculous to cry from a show like this, but it always happens.  




 The only thing you can do is give up. Sounds shitty, but it's all you have left. Don't keep texting her. Cut her off. Maybe she will text you after you don't text her a few days in a row. Happened to me last year with a girl. Things were going great, then the convos got drier. Just stopped texting her.  




 Ain't no party like a Liz lemon party because a Liz lemon party is MANDATORY 




 Yeah, the 30 rock version is actually my favorite song ever right now. I love when Liz says "I've got to go, I've got to go"  




 Yes that's on it too 




 Sadly no :( one of the misses on the album 




 No :( sadly it doesn't have everything  




 Yes! That is so awesome. I'm so happy you have kidney now. I thought it was insane that the official soundtrack didn't have it. Also Liz's 99 Luftballons cover... just fantastic. Thank you! 




 There are 31 total tracks. It has muffin top, Tracy's short version of I will always love you, werewolf bar mitzvah, tennis night in America, Jenna's America song, midnight train to Georgia, the long play of the 30 rock theme, jenna and Danny's Christmas song, the other Christmas song where Colleen and Jack finish it. There are a bunch of smaller jingles in it too.  




 Until recently it never dawned on me that I might be able to buy the songs and background music of 30 Rock. I looked up 30 Rock on iTunes and there it was under albums. $12.99 and totally worth it.   Did anyone else know about this?
I'll warn you all though: you may smile like an idiot when listening to the soundtrack in public.  




 Yes! Honestly this scene makes me so happy and almost emotional whenever I see it. It really shows how everyone in the show really is connected and loves each other in some way.  




 The 76ers are getting there 




 Nice 




 I feel as if this only applies to western society, but regardless I can only speak for western society. They're finding that interior happiness is being replaced by exterior happiness. People have a want for immediate pleasure now such as a high from a drug instead of prolonged pleasure such as success from something you worked hard on. People would rather buy the new shoe, new phone or car than they would buy themselves a gardening kit, a guitar or telescope. More things are available to us in this day and age, but unfortunately those things are changing what makes us happy. We need immediate happiness and closure to feel good about ourselves which of course only lasts for a little bit until something new comes out.  




 There are a lot of non mentally challenged people who obsess over one thing in particular as well. I don't think it's only mentally challenged people.  




 There's an app for that. The crossword puzzle anyways.  




 The time I pooped and didn't flush the toilet. My dad asked me what I would do if I saw that he didn't flush and I said I would just flush it. He then said fuck you as loud as he could to me.  




 I felt my stomach turn as I read that.  




 It's working for me! Thank you!  




 Does anyone have a stream where I could watch this online? 




 4-5. Tonight can lead to a 3 way tie for second in my division or tie me in third. Good news in both scenarios I control my destiny. I'll just need to win out. I'm on a 4 game win streak and I've had luck. Maybe my luck will continue.  




 I had a hangover like this once, it actually made me not be able to drink beer for a little less than a year. My body just wouldn't let me drink it. I think it's like taste aversion or something.  




 So after struggling for 3 months because I missed a good amount of work I'm finally caught up on my bills. I would have some money left, but in all of my excitement I got some Christmas gifts for my nephews and I've got just enough to keep myself going until I get paid again. I'm super happy, but also hungry. I would love a celebratory pizza. All I've had to eat the past 2 weeks is pasta and sauce (it's so cheap) and while I still love it, I love pizza more. I live about 10 minutes from a dominos if anyone would like to buy me a pizza. Thank you.  




 I think you have this, bro. 




 I am up 21. I have Cody Parkey. My opponent has McCoy, Maclin and the Eagles D/ST. I'm projected to win by two. I'm worried. A win here will knock my opponent out of a two way tie in second to a potential 3 way tie for second. Likely scenario is he's knocked into a 2 way for third with me. Best case is Darren Sproles and Kelvin Benjamin combine for at least 29 and I keep onto my lead. That will cause the 3 way tie in second.  




 I have Big Ben brown and Bryant and my god that touchdown might have saved my game 




 Stafford has megatron back. Simple enough. Also Mark Sanchez is still him. 




 Wilson. Giants secondary is weak and they like to blitz. Wilson is very good against the blitz if I remember correctly.  




 I'm a believer in Orton, I think he's a much better QB than he is given credit for. I think he will play a good game. 




 Clear your mind and go with Stafford. All you need to know is that Megatron is back! 




 McCown is going against the weaker defense and is a better QB.  




 Go with Cam. I do not like Philly's defense and Cam I think has more potential for high scoring than Joe.

 30 Rock and 3rd Rock from the Sun 




 I guess I sell brands and dannon's danimal yogurt  




 They know something  




 Good point! 




 I've been binge watching 3rd Rock from the Sun on Netflix and it got me wondering about this 




 I'll be majoring in either History or Psychology.   




 I'll be transferring from a 2 year to a 4 year soon and I'm wondering if the top universities are actually worth the cost. The only advice I've gotten so far is from 1 person and she has told me that I should go to a state school and then go to a top university for my post grad degrees. In my situation cost isn't that big of a deal.  




 So I'm stuck to sleep over at someone's house tonight. Was stuck last night too. Had to sleep on the floor. So my roommate and I were leaving work and he was driving, he didn't say anything about us going to his friend's house again. I was planning on taking a nice shower and making some BBQ chicken for dinner. So now I haven't eaten in several hours, I feel gross and Im exhausted. I also get to look forward to sleeping on the floor again tonight and possibly not eating until the morning. Also going to work in the same clothes, unshowered, teeth unbrushed and phone dead. I would've love to have at least been told that this would be happening tonight. I mean what the hell bro.  




 Beautiful.  




 Is your brother Vali, the 30 Rock writer? 









 I just wanna add that instead of Mathway I use Cymath because it gives you step by step for free. I'm not sure if they have an app though  




 You're looking good and a lot happier man keep up the solid work!  




 I see it too and it's pretty creepy looking  




 Considering how deliberate the trip was and Reus was without the ball... it was very bad. 




 I dropped my phone 3 times watching this gif. There's no way I would be able to hang from there 




 This local Chinese buffet banned sugar packets from being on the tables because I poured a few packets in a cup then got a refill of Pepsi and it exploded on the waitress. 




 No problem, I mean my only experience is having taken art history classes, but that's what helped me do well.  




 It's hard to tell what's tongue in cheek on the internet lol. Yeah that was bad. Hacking the stock market if possible would be damaging to the economy as well. Also one persons voice can unite millions. If there was someone with the goal of terrorizing become popular and then using those people to act out terror then that would be bad too. 




 Yeah those are actually very crippling. In my opinion though, on second thought, something that maybe wouldn't kill anyone, but really cripple the moral of people would be harsh too. 




 Nothin' 




 Larry David. His complaining would keep me entertained. 




 Attack the nuclear power plant in my region. Takes out power, workers and of course the nuclear aspect would be horrifying.  




 Know the style of art your critiquing and know the history of the style.  




 One of the Pokemon games, in pretty sure it was Silver or Gold. What I remember most was getting frustrated that Hoothoot kept fighting me. It wasn't my game, but my brothers friend's game. I picked up where he had left off (right after picking the first pokemon) and this is also the first time I ever got mad because of a video game.  









 I currently work at Lowe's and it's insane how some of these things get by associates. It makes me wonder how many times I've been tricked.

 Okay so I realize that this will be very tough to figure out considering the abundance of italian places in Brooklyn. I recently went on a trip to Brooklyn and we were taken to a very small and nice italian restaurant. Unfortunately I can't ask the person that took us to the place. So I'll try to narrow it down with the details I know of. Okay so the waitresses there all wore black and white stripes and had red bows or something around their neck. They served water in a tall green bottle. The menu was all in italian. It's also only a few blocks from the Barclays center and farther from the water than it. Now that's all I can think of. I'm really sorry. I can't even remember the name of the street it was on, normally I'm good at remembering names, but this slipped by mind.  




 I DONT CARE IF THIS IS REAL OR FAKE WHENS THE NEXT UPDATE 





























 Ly-man Zer-gaaaa 




 We got a grease man.  




 Do I start Gio Gonzalez tonight against the Mets or Anibal Sanchez tomorrow against the Royals  




 It's beautiful seeing us play well and beating Boston. Most of my friends are Red Sox fan and they all said we would be dead last in the AL East and that this is the worst Yankees team in a long time. It's lovely to see us in first place, even if it's only the second of May. 




 You just gotta work at it. It sounds like you need to work with adding, subtracting and dealing with negatives. That's the base you need to build to regain your math. Trust me, it's possible you just need to be determined to do it. I used to hate math, but I realized that I need it for what I want to do after college and this really helped. In my free time I would work on building my basic math and I've tried to stop using a calculator all together and it's pretty spectacular how far I've come. I started in remedial math level courses in college and now I can do some multi step problems in my head.  




 But remember it's important to practice it the correct way, otherwise you're screwed

 I have xbox 360 so sadly I can't play the show. I'm wondering which MLB2k game offers the best franchise mode. I'm just wondering overall, because I have MLB2k10. I'm at the all star break and there are 7 pitchers with a sub 4 era. In the 2010-11 real MLB season there were 11 guys with a sub 3 era and roughly 25 with a sub 4 era. My main concern is stat simulation realism I guess. 

THANK YOU 




 The first game of the season I went to was our win against Boston and you could tell the fans knew he was gonna knock in some runs in his first at bat. If he hits over 275 and knocks in 20+ hrs I would say he's had a successful season and I'm sure most Yankee fans that want the team to win and do well this season are supporting him. 




 So 2k10 would be better than 11,12 or 13 




 Yeah 360 




 The earliest I've played was 2k6 I loved it 




 The Show is really the best I know. Sadly I've got xbox 360  




 So I currently have MLB2k10 and playing franchise upsets me because I'll notice the league leaders in ERA will have an era over 3.50 and only a few guys will be under 4.00. 
I'm really just trying to figure out if there's a mlb2k game out there that doesn't have these issues 




 Well I actually love Arod now :( and I don't think I ever saw a video of it outside of sport center the next day. They didn't say anything about it, you could barely make it out. It was against the Braves. It was either 05 or 06 




 Honestly she could win. Remember the anger in her eyes when Kenneth ate the teamsters sub? Those were the eyes of a killing machine!  




 Well someone could make the argument that we've never had a good president. I wouldn't agree with that, but the point I'm trying to make is that it certainly isn't unanimous that W was the worst president ever. I'm sure if we had a nationwide vote W would win, but that's only due to the recency of his presidency and the likes of Jon Stewart.
