 I can see why haha For me, any kind of tile is awesome to look at. Plus movie theater carpets. The ones in AMC with the stars and planets and shit! 




 That's the thing about it, always hard to meet new people! But hopefully I can connect more with this subreddit. It'd be way cooler to have a meeting of the minds or something and just trip out and share experiences though haha 




 Yes! I'm a heavy gamer too and I have very different tastes when it comes to me and my friends. Gaming and tripping go together like PB   J for me and when nobody else is enjoying it it's like "Ugghhh really?". I completely agree with the 60's culture thing. I think I've gotten a much better understanding of the whole mindset of that culture and it's really great. I might even go as far as saying I'm turning into a little bit of a hippie myself haha Also taking into account that Death Metal is scary for me to listen to when I'm tripping and that's a lot of what I enjoy sober D: 




 Yeah that's another reason why I'm really liking this subreddit. Lots of like minded people here, I've seen plenty of titles that look like they've just been extracted from my mind written by trippers. In regard to babysitting them, yeah, old real quick. It's a waste of a trip sometimes and I value that time since I never know when I can experience it again. Solo tripping is fantastic but at the same time I want to tell people my thoughts haha It's a cruel irony, it's the one time I like telling people what I think. 




 Ahh the first time. Everything is a wonderful surprise. 




 Chance The Rapper (I recommend Windows or Smoke Again). Kendrick Lamar, of course. Some Earl Sweatshirt is nice too.

There you go, man. Highest resolution there is ;D 




 "I take this pharmaceutical and that anti-depressant and also I have a disorder, so how much should I take?" 




 ^This 




 DUDE, I was heading into the theater with my ex when this came out. I had four tabs in my pocket... This chick... said "No, not in public."

As soon as the opening credits rolled, I was like "Yup, I should be tripping."

That's what you get for being whipped I guess... 




 It's just nature, man. Relax haha I'd recommend going outside instead of being cramped in a room but that's just me. He shouldn't bother you if you don't bother him, he's just chillaxin'.  




 So I've always been the type of person to keep to myself. Don't talk (usually) unless spoken to, stay in my room alone, etc. Now don't get me wrong; I have plenty of good friends that I love shooting the shit with and we talk plenty. I guess it's a comfort zone thing but I digress. I've tripped with people on plenty of occasions and I've gotten lost on what to say 70% of the time. Throughout my trips, I began realizing how redundant conversation is. A series of words in a specific sequence to only partly convey your thoughts and feelings... Might be one of those things where I'd have to be tripping to explain it better but that's kinda the gist of it. But not only that, sometimes I'll say the wrong things and just look like an ass. Not like, my words are coming out wrong. I mean I'll say something that might come off as rude or not factual. There is no filter on my mouth. It's annoying cause I have to go on a though loop just to make the right conversation with people. Then, I'm a constant worrier. Not to the point where I'm freaking out. I just want to make sure everyone I'm with is okay and happy. But it's too much, every ten minutes I'm worried someone is gonna go into a bad trip because I said something wrong. Well, my friends all have pretty dark pasts and I have too but, not to toot my own horn, I handle it well. I love dark things usually and I can just talk about things like that when tripping and I'll be fine. But when you factor in the "No filter" thing and worrying about people you can see where it's a problem. Now this is the last piece of this loner puzzle: Nobody I know wants to trip like I do. They want to look at goofy pictures and all that crap. Don't get me wrong, I loooove the visuals. But I'm always the only one reaching for something more than my friends. I want to go on a nature walk and look at the starts and talk about trip theories. I want to watch an in depth movie to get a better understanding of it. I want to dissect everything. Sometimes I even want to chill in silence and just think. That's complete happiness for me. This has all lead me to only being able to trip by myself. Nobody shares my interests, they don't want to enjoy the trippy things that I enjoy. It's a bummer but what are your opinions? Any loners out there? 




 I'm sure there's tons of these posts every day so I'm gonna try as hard as possible to get through this smoothly. I'd like to order SHIT, I only have a Windows 7 desktop right now. I was thinking about purchasing a netbook but I'm weighing the costs on that decision. I looked at the start up guide and I've also read things that say it's a little overkill in terms of safety. I'm ready to learn so if anyone can guide me it'd be extremely appreciated!

-Edited because it was removed for some reason, but yeah.- 




 You know, I've been curious about that. I'd just be afraid to do something wrong with keeping discreet somehow. 




 Hotline Miami, definitely. Also, any RTS games! 




 Always a bummer when some dealer gives you bunk tabs. Had this happen to me the other day. I look very forward to my trips, so getting let down is just blegh. What do you guys do instead when you get beat for tabs? 




 Dude, I know EXACTLY what you mean with fractals. Sometimes I like to think about the universe as just a bunch of different things bouncing into each other at random. It's so fascinating. 




 I would absolutely buy this, I love physical copies. 
























 Oh man, The Thing would could REALLY go either way. The organic effects would be so interesting though. Things twisting and turning and melting and growing... Might try this. Although it might be especially disturbing. I tried playing Octodad while tripping once and now tentacles freak me out so who knows. 




 I love horror and dark things in general. I've always been afraid to put on a dark movie I enjoy or a horror game in case I go into a bad trip or something because of it. What about you guys? 









 Whether it be a microscope or a telescope, you will never see the end. 




 You're right. That's why this is still confusing for me. Dammit, we really need to make that timeline/flowchart already... 




 But wait a minute, isn't HM 2 set in '89-90's? 




 So, in the first game [Beard mentions to Jacket that none of this is really happening](/spoiler).

So, are we in a dream? Are we in Hell? Is Richard the Devil? Either way, it seems like their world may not be set in reality. Thoughts? 




 Fuck your artificial barriers and fuck your shipment of goods as well. 




 Despite the somewhat vague post, I feel like I completely understand where this is coming from. One time I tripped I thought of circles and how everything seems to be a circle or sphere.

Everything is infinite. 




 That's good to hear, I was beginning to think I was the only one with this mindset! 




 I just feel like some people, like me, can lose themselves too much in the trip. For instance; At one point I almost convinced myself that I should live my life alone because that's all I know how to do. Which isn't healthy in reality. Putting good judgement into things is never a bad idea in my opinion. 




 Completely agree with this. Nothing is written in stone, so to speak. As much as our world wants to believe it is. It's scary and wonderful at the same time. 




 Yeah, I've definitely had my fair share of revelations. But take everything you experience from your trip with a grain of salt, if you will. Think back when you're sober just to be sure you were thinking clearly. There's been many people, myself included, that have had false revelations. It can go either way but just use your best judgment! 




 Dude, I've been wanting to trip out and play this! haha 




 http://www.fathomevents.com/event/beyond-the-world-of-interstellar

Never say never (; 




 Encouraging what? If I say "I took two hits" in an LSD forum it doesn't take a genius to connect the dots. I can say Grateful Dead all I want and there's no rule here that says I can't. That's all I have left to say to you. 




 Get off your high horse, I didn't come to LSD for bad vibes... 




 So when Interstellar was still playing in theaters I decided to go see it with my sister and that we would both take two hits of some Grateful Dead. So I wanted to time it perfectly so we'd be tripping by the time the movie started. I gave us a 45 min window and I toked a bit on the car ride to help the peak.

We go in the theater and, surprise, there's these two empty seats right in the Goldie Locks zone of the theater! These seats... where fucking leather armchairs that reclined and all! I saw these seats and I was pissing myself with excitement. We get chilled and then the trailers start. It's hard remembering any of them but they were pretty intense for the most part. Then, the feature presentation begins. Fucking Interstellar.

This fucking movie was just the perfect setting for a trip. Great story, great acting, emotional, great cinematography, and it's about fucking space! The scene where it's just static shots of Saturn and the calm thunderstorm sounds are playing (When the one character puts on the Sounds of Nature CD to calm down) was just perfect. Absolutely beautiful.

Here's something I really loved about it; When a certain topic came up in conversation in the movie (Love, time travel, God, etc.) it was like a roundtable discussion. They didn't let anything fly over your head, they almost explained it directly to the audience with pictures and metaphors and everything. Great learning experience. When they were arguing about love it was just like, DAMN. Also, the first time they go through the black hole and look at the videos from back home over the last however many years... I almost cried with them aha Powerful stuff.

Then, the climax of the movie hits. Everything has been getting more intense and darker by this point. It's one of those mindfuck movies and I HEAVILY enjoy those. When I'm tripping you can imagine how cool that is. So then the story really begins to wrap itself up in a pretty intense way. Arguing, events happening on Earth and in space, it was a lot all at once. My sister started freaking out. She walked out of the theater and of course I walked out with her. Missed the ending of the movie and I will regret it to this day because she decided to just have a cigarette and call our ride...

I don't know the science of it but... Did she really freak out over having a nicotine craving?? Just a thought, I'm not a smoker but it seems logical I guess. Still a great experience that I wouldn't trade for the world and I encourage everyone to trip the fuck out and watch this on surround sound! 
























 I absolutely agree, and I definitely will be out and about during this trip. However, I'm a very techy person so anything with lights and sounds amuses me extremely while tripping aha 




 YouTube vids, music videos, games, movies, short stories, etc.

I like mind fucks and deep stories and all that stuff, but I'm open to anything. Especially serious/dark stuff! 




 This also tripped me out, especially the mirrors! 




 Totally normal. You may find that anything you drink or eat will be masked with the taste while tripping, also. 




 I don't think it's that simple.

There will always be slang. There's slang for marijuana and look how close to legalization that is. Whether you think it's wrong or not, I'll call it whatever the hell I want. Lucy is a slang term and its used right in the fuckin' sidebar. Preach to someone who gives a shit, lad. 




 When I start talking to politicians and scientists, I'll get a little more serious. Right now I'm only on the internet. Nobody important gives a shit about this subreddit or it's LSD activists. 




 Absolutely love it. Didn't think there'd be too many people here who knew of the band 




 It was my desktop background and phone background for ages! Love it so much 




 Hell yeah! Haha For anyone who's curious;

The band is Barrier. The album is called "Eventide". It's a trippy, Metalcore, concept album. Cool stuff. 









 It's shitty. I went to take a walk for like two hours just because it was killing me and now I'm back in my room. I just can't fall asleep, I just want to fast forward to when we can try again. I'm so upset with myself. 




 My group of friends has a couple virgins and we're all pretty normal young adults. You just need the right friends, mature friends 




 Okay, but I'm going to watch it sober first haha I've seen Devil's Rejects but have slacked on this movie! 




 Yeah, it could turn out to be silly. That whole "I see the man behind the curtain" effect hits me a lot while tripping 




 Cartoons while tripping are always interesting, I might try this. What's it about? 




 See, I love horror, but I love letting myself become absorbed the the world the movie is showing me. So I basically let myself believe what's happening on the screen to enjoy it more. This is what I'd be worried about while tripping 




 It's funny because this is pretty much me during playtime with these characters. I feel like there wasn't enough testing in this side of the game, I don't know. Just my opinion. It's somewhat difficult to control them fluently. I mean, I can lure enemies fine and pussy-foot through a scene but I want it to look cool! It's not easy to look cool with these guys unless by luck. But maybe that's just me. 




 I remember waking up and the first thing I read from PC Gamer was "GTA V on PC delayed again..."

A heavy and emotional sigh ensued. 
























 Haha Well, yes and no. I've had some fun but I feel like this trip has been devoted to a lot of problem solving in my life. Internally and externally. Dealing with work, goals, relationships (non-romantic), etc. Lots of progress I think (: 




 I'm more of a night person, myself. Plus watching the sunrise is just something I'm accustomed to while tripping now. It's like, The perfect ending. 




 Bloody chapped legs??? Oh man that sounds excruciating! I'd like to hear that story aha Right now I'm chilling, self evaluating. Listening to the new Kendrick Lamar album through. Great album, I appreciate his background and the messages he's trying to convey and the stories and ideas. Maybe that's a bit of a thought loop though, sorry aha  




 Received, friend. Finally relaxing. Coming off a peak. My hands are still jittery so typing is still hard but I'll come back to this post. Thanks guys, this subreddit is like a safe haven for my wandering mind. 




 Ughh, well it was an adventure for sure. First I got in the car and I just thought "Wow, I can be free now. No longer have to keep my cool." Then I realized I'm trapped in a car with two of my closest friends, but also two other people (in the backseat of a 1-door car of course) who I don't know very well. We drive around, oddly enough run into some other mutual friends and then we stopped at 7/11. I asked them to go in for me, gave them the cash and told them what I wanted. Water, cashews, swedish fish. They come back with a fucking gallon of water and the swedish fish. I told them "No! I know there's cashews in there and I have the money!" So I ran in and got the cashews and came back to the car. Then I realized "I'm not getting what I want, I'm getting what I would've got if I was sober". So I was annoyed but it was all fun. Until I discovered we were just going to a place so they could drink. I was less than compliant and I eventually got my friend to take me home. So it was interesting so far, good and bad. Interesting. Sorry, it's so difficult to type but I'll come back to this post in reality. 




 My good friend said he'd call me at 10pm to see if I wanted to get picked up. I still have so much planned for my trip at home though. What should I do? Uncertainty is always exciting, and I think we might going to his really trippy room buuuuuut I did wanna experience a few things first. Like, things I've been saving in my journal for next time I trip. I'm peaking now, so that's the thing. Do I spend my peak with them or with me? Why am I asking reddit this? You guys can't make decisions for me Ahahah But it'd be cool if you could. I'm sorry for the typing too, I feel like it's getting sloppy. It's gross, I hate it man. But whao didn't mean to get negative. 3 3 But yeah, this was an unnecessarily long reply to your comment haha 




 Yeah man, my cat's been giving me funny looks aha And I really thought I almost broke my glasses.. They're fine though haha 

Wow, I forgot how much of a burden typing is while tripping.. 









 I really love your story, I related to some parts of it and I appreciate you sharing it with us. Especially the personal details and self evaluation. I'm definitely saving this and showing it to some friends. 









 Definitely! Spread the word, too. The developers are completely behind it. I think it'll be pretty nice to have a physical copy of both games, plus the comic. And that mixtape will be schweet. Definitely get it, man. 




 Hahahha Dude, I stare in awe when I'm sober so I can only imagine aha 




 Three hits of LSD, I'm not sure the exact dosage. 




 Yeah, I imagine it'll be hard with 2-3 tabs. But I also love puzzles and when I trip I can just figure them out a lot easier. Hotline Miami is really like a puzzle game, in a sense, so that would be cool. The fast paced aspect could go either way, sometimes I can focus really well but if I'm tripping hard it'll all be really blurry. I'd still like to try just for the story aspect alone. 




 I have been waiting a very long time to do this. Can't wait. 




 Finally have a chance to play these games while tripping. Can't fuckin' wait! Could be incredible and terrifying at the same time. Especially when the "Richard" music plays aha I will report back with my experience! 




 That's interesting, actually. I might enjoy this myself if I knew where to go haha 




 I'm also an audiophile myself, so that's all under control haha I might actually look at some books in the library. I always loved flipping through encyclopedia's when I was a kid. 
























 "Newest big patch that was supposed to FIX the game? Yeah, all our saves are gone. Thanks."

That's how I read that, you guys are so sassy with your Master Race Rage haha 




 "I keep losing track of my pockets. What do all that I own? Can somebody help me find myself???"

I'm a mess when I trip. 




 I thought I might've been the only one experiencing the volume issue, thanks a ton! 









 Oh definitely aha It's funny because it can be a little boring to watch sober, but overly intense to watch tripping. He should save it for next time then if he's iffy about it haha 




 Well yeah haha But I'm saying, I can't really tell what's too loud you know? It's hard to describe. I can recognize volume differences but I don't know when the volume is too high 




 Oh, and Wolf Of Wallstreet was actually pretty trippy. Lots of metaphors, motifs, interesting things you can catch when you're tripping. 




 Haha I feel you dude. I'll have everything planned out and then I'll just be like "Wait, this is all so bland." It's like, the things you think are gonna be cool when you trip aren't as much so when you're actually in the headspace. 




 Lots of people will tell you "Just go outside, it's way better". While being outside is incredibly enjoyable, sometimes people's interests lie elsewhere (Like myself) and that's okay. Do what you wanna do.

I'd definitely recommend Enter The Void: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKRxDP--e-Y

It's completely first person, which makes it very cool to watch when tripping. You notice his eyes blink, you hear his thoughts, his voice is even muffled as it would be when you hear your own voice. It's cool. He's a trip junkie and he takes DMT, then he dies and you journey through the after life and observe the past and future of the lives you left behind. I think everyone should see this at least once during a trip.

A chiller movie I'd recommend would be Disney's Fantasia. Definitely a beautiful thing to see during a peak.

As far as games, I find that roaming around in GTA can be funny and just odd at times. Hotline Miami is a very colorful game, really tailored for tripping. Another favorite would be Destiny. Also very colorful aha I'd suggest more based on your tastes if you'd like, I'm just into anything pretty much. 




 At times, usually during my peak, I'll notice that increases and decreases in volume are kind of weird. It's like, I notice the volume going up and down but I can't tell what's too loud or too quiet. Does that make sense? Anyone else get this? 




 I just realized that's The Son running toward Tony. 




 Call it whatever you want, dude. We all know what you're taking.

GRATEFUL DEAD. 




 So I started out with the intro, it was definitely dark for me. Darker than it was playing sober. I felt like I was experiencing it how the developers intended. The intended emotional reactions from the scenes, I felt tenfold. The first thing I noticed was that I completely forgot to play. At the same time, it was almost second nature to me. Hard to explain. The Xbox controller was hard to handle and my hands were sweating. Somehow I managed to do relatively well. Oh, when I did the Apocalypse level... That was really something. It felt new again. I remember when I first played the level and I was like "What's happening? Why are things blowing up?" This time, I had those same thoughts. Lots of confusion. Plus, I really didn't want to kill anyone... Which was strange. When I got to the first "Boss" (Mark) the growl terrified me. Every boss after that was a bit frightening as well, but in a good way. Very intense aha 




 There's been a whole new meaning to "Gotta get a grip" for me... 




 Still waiting on that story man!

And you definitely should, I really spoke to me during the trip. I highly recommend giving it a trippy listen. His unique beats and sounds and mix of styles just really flows well. It keeps you interested and always changes up in the most pleasant ways. Plus when he gets really serious or emotional or presents questions or ideas to the listener it really gives you something to think about. Something valuable in my opinion. It was great on my headphones though ;D 




 I usually get everything cleaned, take a shower, shave (Love having the smooth face when I trip), and eat a meal roughly an hour before I take the tabs. With the tabs in my mouth, I lay in my bed and either play a simple game that's not too intense or try to watch something animated on YouTube or Netflix. Then I let the magic happen (; 




 Yeah I was loving the window view but I just felt caged and really hot, kinda claustrophobic aha Everything worked out though 




 You mean at the place with the drinking?

I dunno, I don't like drinking and I've had a lot of issues in my family dealing with it. Just a lot of bad memories and things like that. Plus, I have this hatred for it really. All I see in my mind is a bunch of apes and aggression fuel. Not something I was interested in being around. Plus, the guy who lived there is really paranoid and it was making me paranoid. Not to the point where I'd freak out, but just an annoyance really. 
























 It was my friend's, hopefully they understand it died for a just cause. 




 Yeah, I didn't think so aha 




 Does the rice really work that well? 




 Currently I don't have a choice, but I really didn't foresee something like this happening 




 Can't say I wouldn't react the same way aha Gives me more confidence that my machine will come out unscathed 




 Okay, just performed this test and the fan doth spin. 




 What will this test do exactly? 




 I had serious issues with temps before but as soon as I moved down there I never went above approx. 30 




 Aha Yeah, I noticed that after I got a new CPU cooler but I never changed it since the basement keeps my PC super cool regardless. 




 If it was on, what's a possibility of the damage this would've cause? I wasn't home when it happened but my friend said he unhooked everything and took it out. If it was on and got unhooked do you think there would be any irreparable damage caused that way? 




 Luckily I have an extra PSU. I'm not sure it got water in it at all though, there was a Playstation sitting on top of it at the time and that was blocking the top fans. Plus, the GPU is monstrous and completely covers the PSU when sitting upright. I opened it up and only saw tiny tiny water droplets on the motherboard and a bit of moisture on the GPU. It just happened a bit ago and the PC was the first thing we took out. 









 I'm a movie lover, a gamer, etc. It's what I enjoy. Not a waste if it's something you love. 









 Absolutely agree. 




 I am so sorry. 




 It's such a dramatic way to start your day. It really feels like an epic beginning, like you're watching color flood the world. 




 I would purchase your room. 
























 Yarp 




 From Steam Stats:

"Steam is down for routine maintenance every Tuesday." 




 I originally categorized it as "Hijacked Account/Stolen" but I resolved my issue and now I just want to purchase games again. What would you have suggested I changed it to? 




 Hmmm.... This might just be crazy enough to work. 




 I'm having the same issue, actually. I'm also using Gmail. 




 Long story short; I thought my account might have been at risk at a point so I decided to lock it (Huge mistake). I've been waiting four or five days now for Steam Support to reply but no answer. I've never had to use Steam Support before so I really didn't know what I was in for. Now the Summer Sale is almost here and my account is forbidden from purchasing games. Just came here to grieve. Perhaps someone could give me some hope with their Steam Support stories? 




 Good old role playing  




 Dammit, we need lamps 




 I thought I was the only one unfortunate enough to have to use this light method. Works like a charm though. 




 I've been smoking for around 7 or 8 years now. As of the past three years, I've been a heavy smoker. I used to be fine. Relaxed, giddy, aware, etc. Now I just get too tired too quickly and paranoid on top of that. Paranoid that people are watching me or judging me or something. It's pretty shitty cause I would always smoke to relax my mind but now it's doing the opposite. Any opinions on this? 









 I don't really see the cause for alarm here. It's a joke curator, he's had a YouTube channel for quite some time too. It's not that serious, guys. Not really doing any harm. 









 Did you miss the romantic relationship between the War Boy and one of the daughters? And I'd definitely call Max's unexplained PTSD sequel baiting. 









 If I had the option, I'd remove the bars on the windows too. I don't think this is a very good comparison. But obviously enough people like multiple monitors enough that they don't mind the bars. I'd hate them, I would rather have a single screen and nothing getting in the way. 




 Shlohmo, so chill 




 I love dark. I love dreary and miserable, I like movies that make me think about dark things or ask me dark questions. So what you're all saying is that this is made for me? 
























 I recently purchased a few syringes from Earth's Tongue. Cambodian, Argentina's, and Mexican Penis "A". I couldn't find any info on this strain though and was hoping someone here could help? Thank you! 




 I completely agree. The mural leads to the UFO spotting and that's probably about it. If anything, they're making fun of us all because of the whole conspiracy theory stuff. 




 I want to get Grim Dawn and Stanley Parable but I only have about $30 left.

Should I wait to see what tomorrow holds or no? 




 Okay, thank you. Still interesting. I was surprised by how many different types I was finding in my area. 




 So that's the typical name for the commons? I'm fairly new to mushrooms so I'd like to know for future reference, thank you 














 As anyone would tell you, it's just sort of unbearable and hard to deal with. I don't like taking about it so people don't think I'm looking for attention or anything. People really give me a hard time about my issues like motivation, laziness, and my blunt opinions and I don't want to say "I'm only doing it because I'm sad" because that sounds like an excuse so I'm just stuck dealing with it from both ends and it's been like this for years. My mother had me at an early age, to a drug addict. So I have that in my blood. My grandmother though, had my mother with someone who had severe mental health issues like depression, paranoia, and anger she has those traits and so do I now. The only difference is that she is less passive and more aggressive. She can be cruel, selfish, lazy, etc. Me and my sister mostly had to find our own food or rely on our grandmother to raise us. If we were thirsty she'd say "Drink your spit" or "Sip my beer" (she's an alcoholic too). She would lock me in the bathroom with the light off as punishment which was terrifying to me. I remember banging on the door and yelling and I feel like that's where my fear of the dark came from. Now that I'm older she's even worse. She promised us all our lives that we'd have college money and she spent it all. The house is a mess and the pets aren't taken care of because she has allowed her younger friends to control the house. They've beaten up my friends and threatened me with her in the room. It's like I don't have anywhere to go and I'm stuck. I can't make myself happier because very thing that used to make me happy doesn't work anymore. I can't get away because my job doesn't give me enough to live on my own. My own family is giving me a hard time with it and I'm just so fed up with trying to do it on my own and explain myself to everyone. It's not fair and I can't do it anymore. I never asked for any of this. 




 Well it just feels like I know my mistakes and I know what I do wrong. I half ass my work, I'm critical of others (Not insensitively, I just want them to do the right thing. But I don't sugar coat it. They get very defensive). I'm possessive in relationships, I also don't sugar coat things when it comes to that either. Then there's things I'm just ashamed of like my sex life. My sex life isn't exactly inactive, I just am not happy with my performance or nervousness usually. Then things like how I talk with people in public. People will say something to me and my mind just goes blank and I come up with the worst responses, it's terrible. I can't form relationships of any kind and people don't know what to think of it. I read a post on here a while back about this condition where depression is what a large percentage of your brain power is focusing on so it spaces you out and makes it harder to think about anything else including conversation. 




 Grim Dawn is on sale until the 22nd for 40% ($16) off.

It's currently on a flash sale for 50% ($12)

Is it worth the few extra dollars or no? I only have $40 I save for the rest of the sale. 




 Sorry I didn't even think about it, I can't see the rules on my mobile app anyway. I apologize though.

I'm not sure if it's exactly self-learned, more like self-aware in my opinion...

 You should follow r/GTAV_MODS 




 You should pick up Darkest Dungeon, it's $15 right now. Great RPG Rougelike 




 I just prefer watching things like this. I like "strange and slightly disturbing" for some reason, odd as that may be. I completely understand why it's out of other people's comfort zones though. 




 Me too, it's almost unthinkable that PC's are becoming a more popular platform than consoles at this point. I have a huge wishlist of games on Steam though. Some of the ones I'm looking for deals on would be D4, Project Cars, Mortal Kombat X, and Killing Floor 2. What about you? 




 I read a post on here not too long ago about someone saying that Fallout 4 was keeping them going and I related to that one a bit but currently this is what's keeping me going. PC gaming is my hobby and I enjoy it very much. It's the one thing that makes me happy so I'm glad something good is happening revolving my hobby very soon.

Happy spending, to anyone who is a PC gamer!
