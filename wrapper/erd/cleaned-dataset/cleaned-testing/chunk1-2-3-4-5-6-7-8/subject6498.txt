 Japes? lolwhat? 




 Even though he is seated a good distance from the marrying families, Bern Cinder met Lorella Royce's eyes through the thick crowd and thought he glimpsed a smile. 




 I would like sigil #7 please! Oh, and this is my first roleplay ever :P 




 wooooooooooooooooops. Correcting. 




 **House Cinder has been considered outlaws in the Vale for hundreds of years. Decendants of** the first men and named after the volcanic caves that has been the center of a fortified hill by the Cinders since the time of the dragons. Some say the volcanic rockfomations (which has give the house it's name) surrounding the cave were created by a stray dragon.

House Cinder were awarded **Strongsong** recently for their **unexpected loyalty** to the Lords of the Vale in the War of the Ninepenny Kings. Lord Cinder managed to still the warrior's want for the spoils of war when the still outlawed mountain clans rode to war with Lord Ormund Baratheon. Lord Cinder knew war was coming to The Vale. It was just a matter of time. 

**The current Lord Cinder**, **"Burk"** recieved the hand of Marinera Corbray. The youngest daughter of Ser Arman Corbray who is 8th in the line of succession to Hearts Home. Together they have recieved two sons aged 13 and a daughter of 7,

House Cinder's **military forces** consists of 2000 fierce and utterly fearless warriors wielding two-handed weapons. 100 mounted noblemen and 900 archers/crossbowmen

Staying true to the vows made to the Lords of the Vale would grant rewards to the those who were patient. 




 With the last hobbit movie out I'm putting a request out there.
A loyal Tolkien-fan with love for the LotR movies and sharp film editing-skills should cut The Hobbit trilogy into a single movie with a max length of three hours.
Are there any aspiring editors out there?

 Tinfoil? Check
It has begun. The **government** has begun. Starting with kids. They will make them feel it is alright that someone is watching you, making sure you behave. 




 Going on an assignment for Tommen. Goes on a killingspree.  




 I'd say wait if you are an honest man. It has released in some countries (here in Sweden), and english is soon to come. They are good though. Really good. I can really praise the comic too. Really well done. 




 Now that. Is what I call a final stop for this particular train. Spring 2016, here we come. 




 I'm surprised no one have asked grrm on his blog.  




 If this is a cheap trick to score sales for The World of Ice and Fire.... Nerdrage is going to happen. We do not have the patience for this kind of shenanigans. The book is nowhere to be seen and millions of people are waiting eagerly.

But my hype is active so long as George doesn't make a firm statement on the notablog. 




 12th day will be The World of Ice and Fire promotion. I am so sure of it. So sure. (fingers crossed) 




 I think the Bronze sword points a little to some kind of forgotten blood sacrifice done by the first men. 









 It means Winds of Winter confirmed!
What would you expect the odds to be for a sneak release 3 days before christmas? Huh!? Huh?! 




 Maybe **We do not sow"** should be "We **could** not sow" 




 Of course I have talked about it with his parents. I thought it would be an interesting topic to talk about though. And so it has proved to be!

 




 I was thinking **Princeless** would be too. If anyone here has a daughter they want to introduce to comics, that would certainly be something to look at.
The theme fits well with today's gender equality-discussions. 




  Am I missing something here or do you not know about the HBO show?

Wait, what? No of course, but I don't think that the universe is at all near to be fully capitalized. Just you wait Wheemix. Just you wait. 




 Beautifully put, and I must say I agree. When this saga is finished (touch wood) I believe it will expand and be regarded as probably the greatest fantasy series ever written. 

**And the movie-franchise will be crazy.** I expect there to be a bidding war over this series, and it will be big. We might even se a red wedding. 




 Is it just me or is it justifiable to pirate the books to get digital copies when you already bought the books? I would say is.
Pirates must not discuss it here, but we can upvote.  




 You make really good arguments..
Is it known if there is a really easy way to gain access to all the avalible comics of Dunk   Egg? 
A Physical copy is a better gift, but they do have two ipads, so a digital copy could make due..
 




 Yes, **I have realized I at least have to re-read them and see in what context and with which words the adultery is described.** 




 I myself discarded that as trying to make some extra bucks because they only just mentioned it when they released the new edition.

It was obviously not supposed to be a part of the story when it was written in the 1980's. Ten years before GRRM even knew that Jon Snow know nothing. 




 With risk of playing the proud uncle. He's really smart and clearly interested in fantasy. He has read and listened to both Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, and the Harry Potter-series. Narnia too if I am not mistaken.

Thank god his father is a true nerd. 




 This is so helpful!
It's the mixture of those three that makes me doubt if it's a good idea.
I', fairly certain he will love the story nevertheless. 




 Thank you so much for your helpful post! The Graphics Novels would be perfect (great adaption btw) aside from the fact that his English is not that good. 
**Perfect moment to brag about Swedish english!**

He can understand spoken english fairly well, but written it's a different matter.
The book contains all three novellas though, so I might have to re-read them. Which is not a hard task really. 




 It sure is a tale that resembles Westeros a great deal what I have heard.
And Old Nan's hints about Ice Dragons makes it so much more difficult to decide.

But, since it was written ten years prior to **The Song** I take it as a standalone universe, even though they obviously have common themes. 




 Yeah it was the violence I felt unsure about. There are some nasty duels. I think I might have to read it again to make sure about the most gruesome parts.

The Ice Dragon is not Westeros though. Right? And I think it is for younger audiences even thoough he is not to old for it. (doubt even I am to old for it) ^^ 




 **A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, the perfect steppingstone to introduce young readers to the universe?**

I just visited my local bookstore and after I had drooled over "The World of Ice and Fire" for a minute I noticed this book:

http://s.cdon.com/media-dynamic/images/product/book/book/image0/riddaren_av_de_sju_konungarikena-martin_george_r_r-27265257-2403511085-frntl.jpg

This is the Swedish version of "A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms". And I now recall GRRM stating that the book might get an early release for some countries.

**I got an idea that it could be a great gift for my nephew.**
But before even asking my sister if it's ok I wanted to ask here if you think the novellas are ok for a 10 year old child to read.
He probably have more hours on **Skyrim** than I have, which certainly contains a great deal of violent.

It was a long time ago since I read the Dunk and Egg stories, so I just wonder if anyone here knows if there it contains scenes that might not be ok for a child to read? 
**I thought it might be ok, since there are no sex-scenes in these stories what I can recall. Yet. And the story has a protagonist about the same age as my nephew.**

Would love for someone with a good memory to help me out. 

**This could be the perfect gateway-drug for kids today to grow up with George R R Martin's universe, and if they are lucky A Dream of Spring might release just in time for their graduation**  




 Arya in the Mercy chapter was a highlight for me. I have longed for a more grown up Arya who uses her sexuality to lure her prey. 




 Boy, would that be just after world peace on my list! 




 I noticed a funny post on twitter by GRRM, and not wanting to be too creepy , I thought some speculations are welcome this cold november. Shall we throw in some wild guesses for when this gigant will arrive?

I also noticed his freshly **(?)** updated tour dates on his website which shows a lot of booked events almost once a month. I thought he said he was sitting down not making tours to make more time for writing?

**I think tWoW will release winter 2016** (secretly hoping for summer 2015)

feel free to rate this to the bottom of the internet if this is to much 









 Episode 7: **"Edd, fetch me a block"**

That is all I need.
 




 **I suggest rereading.** If you are a show watcher mainly and havn't heard of the theories around R+L=J you should definitely read the first book again. 
You will have missed too much cut material around what happend in Robert's Rebellion.

Audiobooks are great as well. Roy Dotrice is a king.  




 I'd like The Hedge Knight and the rest of the novellas about Dunk to be a miniseries like HBO.

Robert's Rebellion would be so exciting as a feature film.
Barely any recasting. **Charles Dance** returns for coninving Tywin? 




 Yes he is. And this is my theory.

Bran will be able to weirwood.Net-warg Duncan the Tall because he is Hodor's great grandfather. And therefore fulfilling his life's wish of becoming a knight in some sense. (And what a knight).
This is an idea of my own that came to me when I read a passage in "The Sworn Sword" that read something like this: "It was if some God had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior. Was there a god of fools?".
It could explain why Dunk acts recklessly without thinking. And also fits in to some great lesson given to Bran by Bloodraven. Bran gets to meet Brynden Rivers in his physical prime and learn about the history of Westeros culminating with the mystery of Summerhall. 




 Arya Stark or just Arya would be pretty mind blowing. She hasn't been referred to as that in the chaptertitles since I don't know when.

It would be time to go home when her name pops up. 




 Dunk and Egg. Try the graphic novel version. It's refreshing. 




 Naah. There were like 24 Brandons with some Bolton rebellions along the way. Rest assured I think the current Bran of Winterfell will learn a lot about his family's history in **the next books.....** 




 The Walk of Shame. 




 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6%C3%B0r

One theory is that Hr. Brother to Baldr.
Baldr is immortal except for his weakness to mistletoe.

Baldr was tricked by Loki to kill Baldr with an mistletoe arrow.

This could mean Bran safe in the cave where magic protects him from the magic of the Others represents Baldr and Hr is Hodor tricked by another part to kill Bran.

 




 I heard something Kristian said a while back, and that it was him taking a break from the show this year. Have that been changed to Bran not being in it at all?

That sucks then! Heard something about **flashbacks** a week ago. 




 Leto would be the best. Honestly. He's my mancrush. 




 So, we basically have confirmation that Dany will get het whole A Dance with Dragons storyline. (maybe a chapter or so less)

But where will the other characters end up?
**I thought I would fill up this OP with the best theories.**


* **Tyrion** - Ends up practically where book 5 ends. fAegon and JonCon is cut, meeting Ser Jorag and possibly meeting Dany.
* **Bran** -  Confirmed to be stalled one season to catch up with the book with character progress possibly happening behind the scenes.
* **Arya** She should begin her training this season if she is gonna go back to Westeros at the end of season 6. Maybe reaching the Mercy-chapter by the end of this season.
* **Sansa** Filler material. Hopefully gathering the support of the knights of the Vale.
* **Cersei (Whole Kings Landing plotline)** - Maybe as far as the Trial by Combat. Possibly a Maggy the Frog flashback.
* **Jaime** (We know he's going to Dorne, so this covers that plot. Hope for some Bronn development)
* **Brienne** (  Pod) IF they have not cut out Lady Stoneheart completely, she will surface in the last episodes of season 5, threatening to hang Brienne and Pod. if LSH is cut. Your guess is as good as mine what Brienne will do.
* **Jon (The whole North plotline)** - Is elected LC, stabbed and possibly ressurected by end of this season. **GOD. I can't wait for unsullied to get this cliffhanger episode**
* **Sam** If they go with him leaving he probably will be meeting Arya in Braavos before season 5 is over at least, then onwards south.
* **Iron Islands** - Chances are this story will be cut save for Ashas involvement in the North.

Any strong feelings on how they will end next season? I managed to predict season 4 mostly, with some things they cut out and such.
 




 Hopefully another 50 years. 




 The Girl in the Fireplace is a good choice. Especially if he's in to history. 




 Trevligt :) Yeah I feel they catched most themes very well and I'm glad they didn't change any of the names. 
Will probably watch every episode once they're all out. 




 Well yes of course, but they have sure taken some inspiration from the movie as well. That is clear and something I am happy about. Watched that film once a day as a kid! :) 




 **Sanzoku no Musume Ronja**, the japanese Anime, co-produced by Studio Ghibli have aired a few episodes.
Based on the swedish movie **"Ronja Rvardotter"** And the book by the same name written by **Astrid Lindgren** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrid_Lindgren

I really like it so far. It is fairly true to it's swedish inspiration, something that surprised me. My favourite scene is in the second episode. But I like the original swedish version of that scene far better.
link to the scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdAkrQFO-xQ

Have you watched the Anime yet? It is avalible with english sub to stream on some shady streaming-sites and it should not be too hard to find. 









 Please, a link. I am to lazy to find it myself. 




 It's pretty cheap on Ebay! 




 I challenge everyone to team up with a buddy and beat 07:07 minutes boss attack mode!

If you beat my thirteen-yearold selves best time I give you a cookie!

 




 My favourite game Spawn seems not to be supporting VGA if the indicator is the icon at the back of the case.. :(
Might invest in an adapter and scaler if I get money for it. Seems kind of expensive. 




 How much difference does the VGA adapter make quality-wise? Considering I have a 92" projectorscreen I could use some better quality. 




 **Anyone else remember this awesome game?** Well, it's not that awesome now when I come back to it. But as a ten year old, this was the coolest thing I played. Nostalgia is a powerful feeling and this will always be one of my favourite games.

I just played a game of Spawn with my sister, and when playing boss mode I came across the best multiplayer time with my cousin.


We beat the game in 7 minutes (!)
Me and my sis managed in about 25 minutes. Does me an my cousin have some kind of **world record** or something? It's crazy fast.

Pic or it didn't happend: http://i.imgur.com/SGWhyy7.jpg


**Anyone else want to share their record time on multiplayer bossmode?**
 




 Probably Elio Garcia who posted it and it will probably have to do with the eminent release of TWOIAF.

 I don't think **GRRM** uses twitter.
He made Elio set up the account because there were so many fakes with his name. 




 Did everyone notice when he almost spoiled something?

When talking about Aegon the Conqueror and the dragons subjecting the people of Westeros, and with the dragons gone, ultimately they didn't feel the Targaryens had any power over them anymore.

"Of course Dany...." and then he turned in his seat and changed subject. 




 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6%C3%B0r

Balder is Bran.
Enough said. Whole book spoiled. 




 It was late, I quit when I got into a circularized orbit.

I am bringing (except for the gigant launch system I am pulling) a Science Lab, A lander for Gilly, and a small lander for Eve (with two impact probes).

This ship makes me realize I really need to upgrade my computer. 
I can basically hear my processor **screaming**. 




 (Spoilers All) 
This is my most tinfoil-branded theory. But hey! **That's what we do.**

**Bran** will be able to weirwood.Net-warg **Duncan the Tall** because he is Hodor's great grandfather. And therefore fulfilling his life's wish of becoming a knight in some sense. (And what a knight).
This is an idea of my own that came to me when I read a passage in **"The Sworn Sword"** that read something like this: **"It was if some God had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior. Was there a god of fools?".**

It could explain why Dunk acts recklessly, childish and without thinking soemtimes. And it also fits in to some great lesson that will be given to Bran by **Bloodraven.** Bran gets to meet Brynden Rivers in his physical prime and learn about the history of Westeros culminating with the mystery of **Summerhall.**

I know its pretty crazy. But I have wondered why GRRM began writing about **Dunk and Egg** in the first place. They are obviously important to the story. And since he began around the release of **A Clash of Kings** he probably already had Bran's fate decided since long ago.

 The most interesting shit about that chapter is her killing Raff the Sweetling on her own initative, and at the end the text refers to her as "ARYA". 
As opposed to her being refered to as "Mercy" for the entire chapter prior to that. I interpret is an a transition where she is beginning to go back to her original identity. 




 Incestanity and Cersei's fucked up raising of him.

 10 000 ships I seem to recall right? Just had to (a) 




 I only know I like season 4 the most. It's like an origin story when they open up the new firm! 




 That's really cool!  




 I'm certainly no pro. But don't you need some regular rockets for when you have escaped the atmo? :)

I am nowhere near trying to take off Eve myself. Just got back from Duna in one piece! 




 It looks amazing! The perfect circles of moons and planets would be a little stretched though. Probably something you can oversee :) 




 The Arryns are Andals? No? But maybe you mean the mountain clans? Totallty first men-descendants. 




 You can totallty fly up there with a dragon, though :) It would be cool to have a Harrenhal 2.0. With Littlefinger roasting juicy mutton chop. 




 His own squire named Payne? (pain)? Assigned to him before the siege he is afraid to die in.

I think it would be that, but I'm not sure. 




 Also, **I know how to do it myself**. But after hundreds of takeoffs and rendevouzs I am sick of it. The fun part is constructing large interplanetary vehicles and stuff. 




 Considering this post is at the top of Reddit, and it is such a valid request, I would see it as a terrible sign if CA doesn't take the advice and release a demo of some sort. 

**They won't get a preorder from me if they don't release a preview! And I know friends who feel the same.**

They aren't very careful with their reputation. 




 I had to go on 9gag and 4Chan.
And now I'm probably gonna cry myself to sleep. 




 Exactly. Probably the best movie ever to show someone unfamiliar with anime.

And one more thing. Studio Ghibli's movies always has this realistic feeling. People act like normal people would, living ordinary lives. Nothing has this unrealistic flawlessness that comes to mind when you think of Disney's films. (oh I do have some Disney favourites, fear you not)

Roger Ebert nailed it. 




 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095327/?ref_=nv_sr_1

Halfway in I was completely sure it had to be based on a true story. It had so much emotions and experiences that would be completely alien to someone who hadn't lived through these events.
I love books and films based on true stories,  and decided to look it up when the the movie would end.

**And then the ending came.**
I think I cried halfway through the credits, and then I looked up the book and the true story. (semi autobiography)
It is written as a tribute and an apology.

And apparently the ending is shown exactly like it happend IRL.

The most powerful movie I have seen this year. 
**If you havn't seen this film. Do it.** 




 The Stories of Dunk and Egg is the story where Bran gets to live his dream of being a knight. Warging Hodor's great grandfather, meeting Bloodraven in his physical prime.
The Sworn Sword: "It was if some God had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior. Was there a god of fools?"
Remember where you heard it first. 




 * Tyrion claiming Casterly Rock. 

* Daenerys saving the world, in some manner.

* Arya getting to cross off some names on her list. And preferably some Bolton and a certain Frey.

 Yeah

Focus on the ones that is NOT "test this" or "test that". 

 




 I reinstalled everything with MechJeb as the only mod. 

NOW IT WORKS

Time to see if my old savefile will work, watch a lot of docking tutorials on MechJeb rendevouzing and docking! :)

Thank you all for you help. This is what internet is all about.

 




 I'm gonna try a fresh install install tomorrow, really gotta go sleep. 
Thank you for your help! I will get back when I have reinstalled everything. 




 Yeah I tried them, but it won't execute them either. :( 




 It's too large to host at pastebin. Dropbox, why didn't I think about that lol.

https://www.dropbox.com/s/lm2vx550b0tzv7r/output_log.txt?dl=0

here you go. That's a lot of text.. 




 No change :(

http://imgur.com/Gm2TC8z,BdBRgfw#1

Thank you all for answering.. Would really like to get this working.. 




 I posted a thread, but didn't get a sollution, so here goes.

Installed MechJeb for the first time. But it doesnt execute maneuver nodes.
It gets to the target altitude, firing stages and doing gravity turns.

But when it get out of the atmosphere, nothing more happens.

http://imgur.com/GbtAZlt
picture is past the node and on the way down. 




 No it doesn't make any corrections after leaving the atmosphere and change to "Autopilot Status: Coasting to circularization burn". 

Just goes past and downward after that. 




 I had a complete ship with batteries and solar panels, but when it didn't work the first time I made a new save file in sandbox to see if it was a technology problem. Didn't put that much effort into the test rocket. 

The speed was probably due to "limit to terminal velocity".

Added stuff electrical stuff, and changed the turn shape a little.

New picture shows altitude at 62 000 km. past the node at 75 000 and now descending.
Still not working. :(

http://imgur.com/GbtAZlt 




 It will be remembered, but if he doesn't finish it, it will not be a good thing to remember. 

If he finish it, R+L=J and he connects all the dots and make the ending really epic I think it will be as big as Lord of the Rings. 




 Yeah, after the first try I thought it would be the electrical. But after 10 tries I am pretty sure it's not that...

http://imgur.com/pf2aLfG 




 SOLVED!



I'm tired of launcing and rendevouzing so I just installed Mechjeb.
Got it to work, it is great at getting in the air.

Although it won't work entirely. It creates a node at apoapsis, but just goes right past it without buring. 

Autopilot Status: "Coasting to circularization burn". and it says so until the shit hits the fan (ground).

I have RCS, 3 kerbals and a little fuel left in my mainsail and a third stage ready. I don't get it because it manage to drop first stage, do the gravitational turn and set the manuever node at set orbit altitude.
But it won't execute the node.

Anyone have any ideas? This is so frustrating! 




 I read Arya, Jon, Daenarys and Tyrion chapterwise from book 3 - 5. It's awesome to do when you already read them a couple of times.  




 Catched that last week during my re-listening :) 
People who discredit R+L=J are just.... well. Stupid. 




 I **hate** being one of those persons posting a thread with the name of the next book in the title. But I have no choice.

Just read an interview with Kristian Nairn (Hodor) where he said:
"**We** have a season off and we have a year's hiatus, solely because I imagine our storyline is up to the end of the books," 

The whole interview here:
https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/24890664/actor-kristian-nairn-reveals-the-other-side-of-hodor-on-game-of-thrones-themed-dj-tour/

As he said "**We** have a season off" I guess that means his gang. That be Hodor, Bran and Meera. Oh, and Brynden "Bloodraven" Rivers ofc.

They totally have rushed Bran's storyline and I would never have suspected they would pause his story for a whole season, that seem really weird considering the huge twist at the end.

if they now feel they should take a break with Bran for a season because there is no more book material. Is that an indication that **The Winds Of Winter** could well be released 2015? Maybe in time for season 5 to end, or worst case before season 6 airs?

If there were no chance George would have the book out before season 6 is well under way I see no reason what so ever to delay Bran's storyline at all. Just make him a flashback-machine.

I take delaying of story as a good sign. That should mean they feel **hope.** And that is good enough for me.

However I am glad. I don't want weirwoodspoilers in the show.
And I am sure we will get clarifications from D D what the holdup is all about soon enough. 














 Theory about the powers of the Weirwood trees and Bran's extreme warg abilities.

Spoilers D E

I read The Sworn Sword on the plane just before, and smiled a lot when I read the part where Dunk defies his former liege and sends his soon to be slaughtered smallfolk home. 
The reason for my smile was Dunks monolouge after his outburst:
 "It was if some God had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior" 
"Was there a god of fools?"

"not the warrior" felt a little out of place, and got me thinking towards the old gods. 

We do know about someone who can control people. And we know someone who wants to be a Knight more than anyone. 

This could well be wishful thinking and another crackpot theory. BUT IF Bran theoretically could Warg someone in the past (weirwood magic seems pretty craycray you got to admit) do you have a better candidate than Dunk the lunk, thick as a castle wall? 
I bet we will know if it's the jetlag, or if I'm on to something in Winds of Winter and or The Shewolves Of Winterfell. 

In any case, I think Dunk and Egg is really important to the story of the novels. He began writing the novellas between agot and acok I believe. 

My first ever Post on reddit BTW!  
























 Att du ens svarar hr r som att du ber om mer... Haters kommer att hata. Lr dig vnda andra kinden till. Du hr aldrig av oss som tycker att ni har intressanta videos p Youtube och uppskattar ert engagemang otroligt mycket. De som gr ljud ifrn sig r kanske 1  av alla lsare, att att mata dem med mer r verkligen motsatsen till taktfullt. 




 I have a feeling all the haters are jealous because they are so close with George. People often call them arrogant and stuff, which I think is misinterpretation because they do know a whole lot of stuff that we don't.

**Not to say my countryman Linda has not made some really clumsy and/or rude statements about things she shouldn't talk about in public..** When you have a whole fanbase watching, you should feel some kind of responsibility to keep moods up. Responding well to criticism is not her strongest side it seems. 




 Wow... Is that the described size? He feels a bit big.
Awesome picture tho' 




 What platform are you planning to make it for? :) Desktop or Web? 




 HBO has taken breaks with a lot of popular shows. I just wish they would do it again.
Two or three seasons of Dunk and Egg after introducing them with TreeBran would be spectacular..

They seem stubbornly firm on not taking a break though. 




 If u don't feel like read it all. Absolutely. I've done it for tyrion, Arya, and The Wall and Mereen. Only asos and forward. Though.  




 Would be possible fo'sho'. But haven't Bran thought about Meera that way before?  




 How did it go? 

I have introduced close to 10 new people, new to advanced Board Games, though they are fans of the shows and the books. 

And even though it takes several playthroughs to get a good hang off all the rules, new players seem to get a basic knowledge and after 3 or 4 rounds (if they are not afraid to ask their questions when they wonder about something). Past those rounds they can place their orders and such without any problems. 




 the largest part of tToB-cards adds no bonus/+1. There are only a few +2 and +3, and I really like that you can get fortification, sword and the skull, which can make the losing army still kill one enemy unit. 




 Actually not a very bad theory. 




 Paralyzed from the waist down means no boner and probably other problems with proreation. I believe that is a medical fact. But I would be glad with a second (qualified) opinion. 




 Not sure if you are shitting on my wall of text or if I have made your **head spin round, right round.** 




 If you are to believe to sub, I'd say if not over. Close to 9000.

Yeah BR barely counts but you are correct. Will be exciting to see if any others are secretly Targs.  There are quite a lot of those theories.  




 Not live maybe, but after warging Hodor for a year(I'm really bad at how much time is passed) he will know how to do it just as well as he knew all the stones in the walls of Winterfell. If it's possible for him to learn to slip into his skin, staying in the back not controlling him. Particularly since he will know Hodor so well. Well

**I would like to hear theories for the reasons behind Hodor being Dunk's descendant if you don't agree if only to encourage more discussion**.  George would have a good reason for such a twist. Hodor seems like a nobody, just there to help Bran North. Why would the plot need him to be related to Dunk? Someone who probably spent a lot of time with Brandon Rivers back in the days.  




 **Now, are you not prepared to read a long controversial theory.** "Leave now, and never. Come back".

Firstly. Bran and *George R R Martin* shares a huge (apperently gigantic) interest. And that is **Knights.**
http://www.georgerrmartin.com/for-fans/knights/
Also note Bran was the first point of view character George wrote. And in that chapter it was the finding of the Direwolves that came to him Martin first. Warging obviously was a huge part of the whole series from the very start.

And secondly, if you are active here you have seen this theory a couple days back. I have deleted that post, rewritten some parts, and added a whole lot of foreshadowing-material and things that **could** point the right way for this. I must say though. Ever since I first thought of this in August I am getting more convinced the more I dig, so **I need people to read what I have with an open mind and say that this is not possible.**


 nbsp;


 nbsp;

*"Ofttimes a very small man can cast a very large shadow"*


**PREFACE**

This theory that I have polished for months **stands and falls with Hodor being the descendant of Ser Duncan the Tall**, (which I strongly believe he is, even if my own crazy Crackpot turns out false.) **And it would also suggest George's fantastic reason for him being the grandson/great grandson of one of the finest knights the realm ever saw.** Here I would also like to point out that Duncan lived almost 100 years before ASOIAF, and yet we will probably know more about him life than Ned Stark when George has finished his planned material.

I also want to say I am not suggesting different timelines here. What has happened has already happened. There won't be any paradoxes.

And I must say. If my theory is correct. George is hands down one of the most genious storytellers who ever lived. 

 nbsp;

**PROLOGUE**

To get started, here's 7 feet of tinfoil, make yourself a rugged but practical Greathelm and get in the saddle. Because we are are going on an adventure.


I think it's safe to say we are all waiting for The Winds of Winter. Before reading any further. Contemplate this for a moment. Who do you think sends the Winds, little lord?

We can all agree that tWoW will take Bran much deeper into the magical world, and I have always (even before I came up with this theory) believed that will be on such a scale the reader at this point has never witnessed or even dared to imagine. The winds he sends will be so significant they will be an entire aspect of the title of the whole book.
While the whole idea could and most likely will be complete nonsense. (one cup of self-distance every other day is healthy for your mental stability) It would be super-duper-mega-cool if this where to be proven right. So I beg of you. Bear with me for a moment.



**THE THEORY**

The magical abilities Bran possess is undoubtedly incredible. Jojen shat his pants when discovering he could take control of Hodor. Something even he had never heard was possible(?) Bran has had very little real training up to this point, and he has but gotten a few glimpses of what warging and Weirwood.net is capable of. We have seen him go far back in time, watching his father and sending him some rustling leaves, and Theon even heard him speak. I have a I think that will change. Bloodraven most certainly will teach Bran everything he knows, and I would bet he knows more than anyone (for now). How BR will show and teach Bran what he needs to know is totally unknown at this point though, and that is what my theory is all about.

I think he will take Bran back in time to when he was Brynden Rivers. He will get to study the life of a Targaryen prince. And, most importantly (for Bran and this theory anyway) is to let Bran do that from the eyes of a Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.. And what a Knight he will be/was! "Three whole pages for Ser Duncan the Tall.." The few times Dunk is mentioned in the novels they speak of him as one of the most honorable Knights who ever lived.

Towards what ultimate goal is Bloodraven doing this then? He will gain Bran's trust when fulfilling his deepest wish, he will show Bran that he is Brynden Rivers, A Targaryen bastard and not just a dude in a tree. Bran will be the one escorting Branden Rivers to the wall and he will also be at Summerhall, one of the series larger mysteries and the reveal will most likely be some sort of twist. The weirdest thing about this must be that he will fall in love with young Old Nan...

It makes me think Bran might learn to do what Hodor does when he's getting waged. crawl up in a corner where he cannot reach him. But he can vaguely feel his presence. Just controlling minor things that doesn't scare the crap out him.

Now, I have gotten the subtle impression GRRM has a secret love for foreshadowing. So here's what I can remember. Making it all fit together if you tilt your head a little to the left while squinting your eyes.

 nbsp;

**FORESHADOWING**

- "The Sworn Sword", Duncan the Tall: *"Go home! All of you! Back to your villages, and see if the fire's spared your homes and crops." "It was if some God had put the word in my mouth.* **Not the warrior.** *Was there a god of fools?"*

That bold line felt so out of context and the *"Not the Warrior"* -part was what sparked this whole theory when I read The Sworn Sword on my way to Spain for a vacation.

This happens when they are drilling the farmers, and is the most notorious foreshadowing I will present. And it is certainly not the first time Dunk has behaved impulsive. We know Bran is very kind to his smallfolk when serving as "Lord of Winterfell" And I can not see why Dunk would think about the gods in a moment like this. He is not a very pious man what I can recall.

**farfetched you say?** well this is the Hound to Arya: *"Keep your mouth shut and do as I tell you, and maybe we'll make it in time for your uncle's bloody wedding."* I try to remember that this is George, and he is the grandmaester of subtle (subtle) hints.

- **"Dunk the lunk, thick as a castle wall."** That is something he gets called, and often think about himself. We don't know really except it insultes Dunk's intelligence sounds extremely catchy. Him being a big fella makes it really fitting.

 nbsp;

**But let's take a step back.** In A Game of Thrones first chapters, a lot of focus lies on Bran's climbing the Walls of Winterfell. Of course it all leads up to the fall, but it is very explicitly describes how Bran has climbed them so often he knows every stone in Winterfell so well he could probably climb them sleeping (paraphrasing).
With the loss of his legs, he can't climb the Castle Walls anymore which he loved almost as much as his dream of being a Knight. But he get's part of his ability to move back with the help of Hodor. And even though this is a long shot. I can't see "Thick as a Castle Wall" as just a joke on his name. Not after I was taken from behind by "Not the Warrior"


- *"You will never walk again, but you will fly"* It is established in the first chapter of A Game of Thrones that this boy is dreaming of the glory and the tourneys. But it doesn't end there. I would say Bran thinks about his crushed dream of becoming a Knight more times than you could count, and I see that as a reminder that it is something he has not gotten over yet. Bloodraven quote here has the literal meaning. "You will Warg dragons". And it has the hidden meaning. That he will do more than he ever dreamed was possible.

- Bran's last chapter has some crazy visions. Ned basically confirms R+L=J, we get to see Lyanna fighting (I think?), possibly foretelling that she is tKotLT. We see a mystical pregnant woman who wants revenge. And we see The First men about to make a human sacrifice. (All these could and most likely is Bran's family and ancestors)

And then we see Old Nan kissing Dunk... (I suspect) Why is that important? Why are we shown that along with his family? What is Hodor if not just a way for Bran to get to point B? Why does BR first show him members of his family, and then a Hedge Knight secretly travelling with a prince?

- ASOIAF is pretty unique in it's point of view storytelling. And while the complete history of the Targaryens (tPaTQ and tRP) is written as an in universe history book. The Stories of Dunk and Egg is written from the perspective of Dunk.

- The first scene in The Hedge Knight. Ser Arlan is dead, leaning against a tree.
I don't see GRRM just making it so because it's cool. It must have a purpose, like everything else he writes.

**GRRM is planning 9 novellas about Dunk's life as a knight.** He released The Hedge Knight the same year as A Clash of Kings, 1998. And I can not fathom why he would begin writing a separate story at the same time. If the two stories were not heavily intertwined and important for the whole story I don't think he would have written the whole thing as a separate trilogy. (that is what Dunk and Egg will become when it's finished) Releasing it parallel with the novels could implicate it is really important to know about Dunk and what he did when you get to reading the later part of asoiaf.

**Also remember who has the first chapter, and remember GRRM's and Bran's extreme love for knights.**
http://www.georgerrmartin.com/for-fans/knights/

P.S. 
This could actually fall under the same theory as Bran in some way being Bran the Builder and/or some of the other notorious Brandons. Particulary Bran the Burner. His father went away and didn't return. His son Bran the Burner reacted pretty childish to me.. Setting all remaining ship ablaze. That sounds incredibly impulsive and something he probably regretted dearly after, just as Dunk regretted causing the trial by seven.

EPILOGUE

Now it's time for everyone to shoot my imaginative ass down (I put a lot of effort into this, so shoot me gently).
Otherwise add something. (I would like to read every Bran chapter word for word.. Got any knowledge of him wishing to be taller?) **Discussion is all we have until date unknown, and I wish to cherish that.**

**If you don't agree**
If you don't agree with this at all (say so, and then join the discussion about Hodor and Dunk.
I would like to hear other theories about what the point is of him being the descendant of possibly the most honorable knight in history and why that never being discussed! 




 How could I not make that connection... Oh well. The answer is my sigil. 




 I know that. I didn't base this on the data, I based it on my own personal experience. Someone posted it in a comment and I added it because it was a terribly relevant study that seems very well done. 




 lol. My thought exactly when reading a third of all posts. (But we are still here aren't we :D)

I will cherish the day an announcement arrive. This sub will be **on fire**, and the spirits will be as high as the wall,

(**touch wood**(more like banging my head against my coffetable)) 




 What a wingman I have. I was ready to give up that argument! 




 I agree, you shouldn't vote on every post. You should vote if you think the post should to be acknowleged. And you should vote thereafter.

It feels like people think I made this thread fishing for upvotes. I just thought it worth to point this out.
 




 Thanks! So I may be on to something here? I feel people are mostly serious on this sub (hypethreads aside) Ironically enough, this post has lost about 7 golden dragons in the last 30 minutes...

**It truly is useless to try making the world a better place.** 




 Because Baelish says "I know, I know" in a certain way. Could be nothing though, but I made the thread because there are bound to be others I have missed, and someone has certainly picked one or two up. 




 Yeah, of course I hope ^^But I am so tired of being disappointed. People must have thought he would write the next book quickly since the end of aSoS... 




 Oh, didn't think about that! Three is a good number, but it could very well be a little nod towards it! 




 If you think it is troll, absolutely. If you think he is serious, **correct him or let someone with more energy do it. Someone most likely will.** 




 I think they should add it as a possible murder-weapon in Clue. 




 Really?! Well. Yes I could very easlily see that as true. 

I first noticed how people did this after typing up my own tinfoil theory for two hours in bed on my Padphone.... I think I would have at least 30-40 less downvotes if people knew about how to use the buttons.

**And I am pretty sure I'm not the first to have typed up a long post** really putting in an effort to make it readable and easy to follow. Just to have it downvoted because people disagrees, making it slide down the pages much faster. 




 **this is exactly what I mean!**

it doesn't matter if your post is misinformed, far-fetched or dumb! As long as you make your point, don't break the rules or make a rude comment and most importantly **DON'T TROLL** people shouldn't downvote you no matter how stupid the post is. (Well.. There are exceptions confirming the rules)

**And that is what you and many others hasn't understood. 

People downvote posts because they think what the OP asks, states or thinks is misinformed and or just doesn't agree with their opinion.

And all this brings down interesting discussions.

 




 And for some time to fuel the flying flamethrowers. 




 nice one! 




 And he writes slow. 




 Great post, but thinking aDoS will be easy for him to write is pretty naive of you. **If it will truly be the last book** he will want to get everything completely perfect. That's just the way he is. We've known that for a long time.

If he isn't pleased with what he has written, he will rewrite it. And he will do it again, again, again, again, again. Then he will change it completely. 




 I don't see her having time to conquer north Essos before the series end.
I hope she unites Slavers Bay and make it Unslavers Bay. Setting in motion the abolishing of slavery in the entire world. Then leaving for the east. 




 I'd say skipping the first book is the worst book to skip! 




 A lot of cool characters are cut from the books, but I think the writers plant references and homages to characters they had to leave out. My find is the scene when Tyrion and Littlefinger are talking about rewarding Podrick Payne in S03E03

This caught my attention.

T: "did fuck her once."

B: "I know."

T: "But we don't."

B: "I know"

Baelish changed his voice in a way that made me think it was a reference to Patchface. I don't know if it is something everyone noticed but I was pretty astonished!
 




 I am still hoping Benjen will be a prologue/epilogue in a future book. 




 Ilyn Payne would indeed be really cool! Would love to know what goes on inside his head. 
Those chances are pretty slim though I suspect. 




 Hoping tWoW will shatter this with Bran! The magic is one of my favourite aspects of the universe, but maybe that is because it is so mysterious. 




 I would think others who are well versed in english history (I am not) has already made this connection, but I havn't heard about it anywhere.

It sounds to fitting to be a coincidence, particulary since I am pretty sure Richard III is an inspiration for a couple of characters in the series from what I have read elsewhere. 




 Well of course. I was of the impression that was obvious considering it's a 700-page book shown in ten hours.
But it was my mistake I wasn't clear in what I meant. 




 Well, I put it wrong. Almost every scene in the show is take directly from the book. Even the dialogues are pretty much the same.

 




 I agree. It's far more vague in the show though.
Some showwatchers who aren't as hardcore as us hasn't figured out the difference at all... 




 With the shattered sword in the prologue, I think GRRM tried his very best to make it as noticeable as possible ;) 




 When I first saw that name I thought it was a wink to Tolkien and Frodo's alias **Underhill**. That was before I knew that he reffered to Hugor of the Hill though.

Honestly, I still think it is an homage! 




 I'd say "all of this has happened before and all of this will happen again" is already happening. More or less? 




 And I know the reason why that is.

**Upvotes/Downvotes are NOT Reddit's version of Facebook's "like button" (Or the much wanted dislike-button).**

(**Yes, I realize this post could be subject of extreme irony**.)

I think people on this subreddit misuse the downvotes incredibly often. People put a lot of effort in putting out theories, asking good questions and starting discussions about this and that, only to have the posts downvoted to the bottom by people who just doesn't agree.

**And I think that hurts this sub a whole lot!**


So, I provided the rules (not more like guidelines. actual rules) for votes. Which actually are pretty hard to find if you are not an experienced redditor.


- **Please don't downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it.** Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, **rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.**

- Please don't Mass downvote someone else's posts. If it really is the content you have a problem with (as opposed to the person), by all means vote it down when you come upon it. But don't go out of your way to seek out an enemy's posts.

- Upvote or downvote based just on the person that posted it. Don't upvote or downvote comments and posts just because the poster's username is familiar to you. Make your vote based on the content.

**FAQ**
 
##24. Someone made a mistake in their post or comment! **Did they even read the book? Should I downvote them?**
No. If you can do it nicely, feel free to correct them and move on. If you cant do it nicely, just move on.


**To my astonishment** jsdistasio **pointed out that this sub is one of the most downvoting on Reddit as a research done about a year ago points out.**

http://blog.getredditalerts.com/reddit-sentiment-analysis/  




 I'd say all of essos payed up together, hiring the FM to make it go kaboom. 




 Warg Bran teached him / Was Brandon the Builder all along. 




 Missing the House of the Undying, "promise me Ned", book Stannis and Patchface? Shame on you :) 




 First book is almost scene by scene. By the third book most things are changed, although they mostly arrive at the same point.

I know you are tempted to skip forward. Some of my friends have, and they have missed so much **You must bring yourself to read the books** though. You need to learn what Daenerys is thinking. Emilia Clarke doesn't portray her character as well as I wish she would.
And Ned's chapters are gold. Just pure gold!

And of course what everyone already mentioned. All the prophecies, foreshadowing and backstory.
First and second book as a lot of those. Particulary House of the Undying is very different from the show. 




 If they are talking about dead men, it's a **wight.**

And every time **Others** enter the stage, everything freezes to ice unnaturally fast. And when they are spotted, the POV-character pretty much shit their pants.* 




 I would say it's slower. But I prefer listening sometimes. Awesome while driving, making the dishes or cleaning the apartment.

**Some people doesn't like Roy Dotrice as a reader though. But I quite love him!**

I would say it is not the best way to consume the series if you are interested in theories and such. You miss hidden details whie listening and can't stay and go back a line to analyze. 




 Quite possible. Had not heard that before. A little like how the peace with Dorne was brokered? 




 Dragons  




 Holy shit. Didn't he burn the ships because his father died or something?! 
Burning your whole fleet seems just as impulsive as punching a prince in the face. 
Would a grown man really do these things?  




 This is certanly new, but I would think there would be at least small foreshadowings and/or hints towards it. I am a bit of a theorizzeeer myself though, so I don't blame you for letting your imagination run wild!

I don't see George introducing people aging backwards more than halfway into the series. That would be super weird. 




 There are probably a lot of huge fans out there who read the books but hasn't experienced the greatness of **The Tales of Dunk and Egg.**

I want to take this moment to fully acknowledge the fantastic quality of the three published novellas and I urge fans who have not read them to do so.

It is a much softer read than the novels and I would say the quality of the stories are spectacular. You really sympathize with Duncan, and I would say they are mostly pretty feel-good. Something that is rare in this universe we all adore so much.

No one of my friends who are fans have read The Tales of Dunk and Egg yet (despite my warm recommendations), and 
I suspect because it is because they have no idea who those characters are (only being mentioned a couple of times in the novels).

**Do yourself a favor and read them. You won't regret it.** 




 Read Dunk and Egg asap. They are weirdly by-looked. 




 Yes. Mace Tyrell is not fool, as the show want's us to believe. And I think their words are really fitting. They are ambitious as hell. Probably more so than the Freys. But they have patience. 




 He was called that because he was the last Dayne King.

It's like "The King Who Knelt" 




 Healthy perspective. 




 Isn't passionate about them? I'd say he is incredibly passionate about promoting new writers in Sci-Fi and Fantasy so editing collections and anthologies seems to really be his thing. And he totally loves Wild Cards what I understand. 




 I'd say the Manderly's have more money than the Starks. But that's just a wild guess. 




 What has happen has already happend. Timelines would ruin everything and will not happen at all. 




 I'll take it! 




 Really!? Didn't notice that one! Anyone wants to find the paragraph? I don't have the book with me home over christmas (It's actually already released as a bound book in Sweden) :) 




 That would make me happy, and sad.  




 You make me feel so shiny!  




 Really?....  




 That's how a season begins though right? :)  




 Read Bran's last chapter when I sees Winterfell. He sees Eddard and it practically confirms Jon Snow to be the dude we all know. 
It's regarded as a fact for a reason 




 No. It doesn't spoil the events it's spoils the history. 

**I'd say reading it as a watcher-only would enhance your view on the entire saga.** It's such a vast world.  




 Stop. I don't want to think about this.. 
II'd like to think the ask George stuff, but mostly I think they are going on it alone. D D knows the rough outline, and considering many of the deviations in S4 I'd say they are doing their thing to get to the end In a way possible for them. 




 Oh yes! Ser Duncan the **Tall** probably the furthest you could come from a cripple, simple minded. Possibly Hodor's great-grandfather or something, making it more (somewhat more) believable for Bran to be able "warg" a person from history. 

We also know he has interactions with BR. 
More crackpot is that it may be revealed in the next book, and that's why Dunk and Egg 4 was postponed and replaced with The Princess and the Queen. Supposedly the next Dunk and Egg will take place in Winterfell/The North  




 So you have reached denial huh?  




 If you read twoiaf you will appreciate the books history references so much more!  




 It is known.  




 Dany says fuck Westeros, I will stay in essos and banish slavery everywhere.  




 Varys. Oh, and Hodor.  




 'cus she wanted to get rid of that bun in her oven before telling?  




 My own precious tinfoil theory spins on your comment a bit. 

It has been stated several, several times Bran wants to be a Knight. And I think Bloodraven will let him be one in the past as a lesson in treestuff. 

My theory actually has one line that vaguely hints at this being true. 
**Please, ask me who the Knight is. Please. Please.** 




 Since Christmas origins from the pagan holiday occurring when the days begin to grow longer again, I would think it unlikely, since there is no way to predict when that is going to be in Westeros.  




 To ensure he would not incite a civil war, he made it doubly impossible for him to take the crown. Probably even more honorable than Ned now that I think of it.  




 Well, Homo Sapiens used to screw the neanderthal, but that was also a long time ago...  




 This here is a perfect example to show you that you shouldn't listen to everything that people posts about this series. No matter how well read they may seem.  




 Brandon the Builder, AKA GRRM's cheap way of explaining why Starks have no naval power. 




 As the gate is on my doorstep, I send 1000 men to strengthen Vale's defences. 




 Your Grace.  









 You have 1000 men from Strongsong my liege. 




 I will send 1000 men from Strongsong to accompany you. 




 There should be a max amount of tradeagreements simultaneously. And there should be resources. Stone, Steel, Grains, Fish, Wood and Gold?
6-10 resources should be enough? Cattle and horses? 




 If this should lead to aggressive negotiations, the Cinder's would be glad to lead the vanguard of the Vale to victory. I am certain the north pretenders will bend the knee to the Starks though. 




 I greet you my lord. Know that the men and women Strongsong stand behind you. 




 The Cinder's of Strongsong stands behind Lord Sheridan of the Vale. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell, and the Starks has ruled the North since before the Andals arrived. 




 [OOC] I am a first time player as well, and has taken a holdfast in the Vale, playing as a "new" family.  




 The Vale will prevail. 




 We have united the clansmen the in the valley of The Vale, what dangers may lie east of the mountains is unsure. A small escort of a dozen knights and squires may seem appropriate for seeing lady Baratheon safely though the east. 




 Lord Royce, we share the same ancestors in the first lords of The Vale, and we salut you as family. 
 




 too soon. 




 I will try this out. Hope fore some good developments in a week or so ;) 




 With the growing tension in the realm and concidering the incident at Duskendale 276AC. I Lord Burk Cinder of House Cinder wishes to swear fealty to you, Lord Sheridan. The new Lord of the Vale.
My ancestors have lived in these mountains since the Dawn Age. And we wish you to consider us some of your most loyal bannermen, 
The King has not been seen leaving the Red Keep for 4 years. Stange tales are being told about his mental health. We must stand together to face the times to come. 

**The Vale must prevail!** 




 A rugged, very tall knight from across the table gave him a clout on the ear. And Bern dared not look up to the hosting families. Ever Again. 




 Some southern jester with colorful clothes. 




 Well Lord Cinder has been mindin' his own business, pinching his wife in the ass and laughing at the drunk fool at the head at the table. T'was the eldest son of Lord Cinder who laid eyes upon the fair Lady Lorella. Noone except Lady Lorella notced the incident and therefore no one could blame him for it. 

Or call them Japes or a sign of disrespect of any kind. 





























 I can only speak for myself, but I think the graphic novels are **superb**. Not much differs from the novellas in regards of the text. Though I am not an expert.  




 Patience my dear Padawan. It will all come. So long as HBO doesn't fuck up the rights, or sell them to Warner we are all good. 




 You are keeping a good pace! My tip is don't rush. There are vital information on almost every page, and you only got one chance to read the books for the first time.  




 They had Dragonstone for a long time before moving there. It was the westernmost outpost of the Valyrians.  




 The Golden Company started as Blackfyre loyalists.  




 Casualness, casualness, casualness. 




 No it's more the setting of Bloodraven. He should have one eye with roots digging into his very flesh. He just sat there like a regular dude.  




 Also Doctor Who is pretty overwhelming when it comes to brittish guest actors.

**'t'was a lot more than I realized.**
 




 Benjen is the Nights King confirmed 




 Rhaegar?   




 yes, partially. 




 *"Unreliable Narrator"* is GRRM's explanation that describes the whole "Wylla scenario"
The name of the series "A Song of ice and Fire" should add some thought.  




 Nice thought. Could be they travel past it, and we get a bit of history. 




 Brynden Rivers is Ravenclaw 

Dunk is Hufflepuff

 




 The thought as come across my mind as well.  




 Thanks!  




 YES. But make sure to get A Feast for Crows expansion as well. Vanilla with less than 6 players is a bit broken, but the exp-pack makes the game a 4-player objective based game that doesn't take 6+ hours. 




 The Lady of the Vale will probably open her arms wide when Dany arrives through I would think. It was to Aegon and his dragons Torrhen Stark bent his knee. I think Sansa will remember that. 




 I wonder if they are preparing people to see Game of Thrones at the cinema.. 6 seasons and a movie, anyone? 




 There is also the sun Daenerys remembers. The sun rarely shines in Braavos. 
You should read the Luke and Leia post if you are interested in the theory. I quite like it, although we *have to wait and see* 




 He hasn't lied about his unfaithfulness because he refuse to speak about them as to make any more lies. I think R+L=J is solid. Totally fits the title of the book. What I don't know is The frickin' lemon tree. There are plenty in Dorne, but none known in Braavos. Rain and Fog doesn't give lemontrees a chance.

But if Daenerys was born in Dorne? Is she the daughter of Aerys? Viserys was a miracle after millions of miscarriages (10?)
The whole Luke and Leia post really got me thinking.. I think I will make another as to put fire on the discussion. 




 I watched John Oliver on net neutrality. And he got me thinking. Internet Providers basically has us in our grips. 
I will provide a personal example which I hope others will too.

Watch the very informative John Oliver explain it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpbOEoRrHyU

 nbsp;
**In Sweden**, where I don't think it is as bad as in the US, the status quo is:

*-* 3 or 4 big providers for countryside and suburbs.

 
*-* Around two more advanced providers additionally avalible in larger cities.

My sister lives three blocks from me in a smaller city, separated by a main road. I have access to one of the big ones exclusively, and she has access to the other two.

The one I've got also has cheaper service in student-apartments.

 nbsp;

If one could gather information on avalability you could possibly prove that they have areas of control for reduced competition and therefore possibly *illegal(?)* monopoly on the market. 




 I'd take some *Unsullied*, Dothraki riders and freed slaves for archers, grab an Ironborn fleet that is cruisin' nearby and go straight for The Vale of Arryn. 

Conquer it in a couple of days with my 3 dragons. And then I'd have an inconquerable stronghold from which I send letters saying "Bend the knee, or I will fry you like bacon. **Burnt black.**


*But hey, why not chill in a pyramid?* 




 You should call HBO or GRRM's marketing guys. Use the interwebz to find a number somewhere.  




 Upvote for flair, but well. This is old news on this sub I would say
t'was the redditor Honey-something who discovered the Benjen stuff.

**How much Anne Groell knows about where George is in his process has been disputed by the Maesters for centuries.**
 




 I like your spirit. *But we'll have to wait and see!* 




 Dunk of course.. 

 




 Want to fit this into my own tinfoil of Bran warging Dunk with the help of Bloodraven. 

Sworn Sword: "It was if some God put the words in my mouth" 

Remember how Bran desperately wanted to be a Knight and is told he never will be. 

Well, as it happens Dunk isn't a Knight, and still is the most chivalrous Knight in Westeros?   




 Jaime is going to the Riverlands in the end of the seasons though right?  




 http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0265610/

Her schedule seems a little light, am I right?

One movie completed and a tv series that I don't think have been shooting this fall if I am reading the air-dates correctly.


She is born in Ireland, so she would have reason to be basically on location..
**I have hope**, but I am ready for a dissappointing surprise. 




 Well. if R+L=J, Aegon i fakeon then J = the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, since he is the last male heir to the throne. 
 




 That would be ironical considering how Ned's oldest son does exactly the opposite and well.. 




 That's how I first interpreted it. Now I don't really know. it feels like some old gods magic to me but.. well it's in my titles. 




 Really like this theory.

*But we will have to wait and see!* 




 average would be average health.  




 You'll have to wait and see. 




 The dragon must have three heads.
Daenerys eggs,  Lyanna's crypt and Aegon with greyscale? 
Sure, *but you'll have to wait and see!*
 




 The significance here I would say lies in that you could identify another Warg?  




 The big three. D or J i would guess.  




 Got mit uns!  




 I feel that Bran is not so bad in the books? His chapters are like magic,  magic, magic. Awesome magic.  Show Bran is whiney as hell.  




 Worth noting is that the English version will be **heavily** illustrated. The ones released in other languages this year will not be..  




 AFFC is slow. It picks up but not to the extent of ASOS. 




 I got the black one! Just had to say that. 




 Yeah, visiting Gibraltar Casterly Rock was all I thought about. 
That and the Neanderthals. 




 April 1st right? 




 Maybe! You'll have to wait and see. 




 Coldhands = Brandon the Builder confirmed?  




 Maybe the best casting of season 1? 




 I hate that the door seeminly have been painted white :( 




 I think CH is an old (old) dude. First Men for sure. Maybe a Stark, maybe just nobody. (But probably a Stark) 




 That TES V: Skyrim was a bit influenced by A Song of Ice and Fire is certain. Dragons, The Northerners rebel against the kingdom (empire). Riften is basically Braavos and Windhelm and Winterhold makes me think of Winterfell. 
Oh, and Draugers..

But I came to thinking about TES IV: Oblivion, and Brother Martin is the **illegitimate son of Emperor Uriel Septim VII**, and the last remaining of that ancient bloodline. In the beginning of the game, he is sworn as a munk. At the end, he turns into a dragon.

Am I grasping for air, or is The Elder Scrools very influenced by A Song of Ice and Fire?
**Bethesda was almost about to make a licensed Game of Thrones!**

http://www.vg247.com/2011/09/15/bethesda-why-we-turned-down-a-game-of-thrones/ 









 I do not think they hold a finished novel in ASOIAF. They want that out ASAP. George could be sharing information with his publisher though. It's just the readers frustration he is tired of, right? 




 Why not. We have nothing better to do than wondering about how potatoes got to Westeros anyway.

New editions for A Song of Ice and Fire are releasing in October this year. Which could very well be Harper Voyagers way of cashing in inbetween the wait for the next big payday.

But I always keep a good look on GRRM's website. Particulary the tour-dates.
http://www.georgerrmartin.com/appearances/
The next big convention is The Pacific Northwests Science-Fiction Fantasy Convention which almost coincides with the Season 5 premier date. And after that if follows with Fantasy conventions all year long.

**Let's speculate** Our dream would come true if GRRM announces this April with a summer/autumn release. 

My more modest but still falthering hope is we have the book by Spring 2016, before season 6 starts. 




 Maybe it's 6 books?

*The Winds of Winter Confirmed*?

 




 God I would hate this. And I have nightmares about it happening. **It happend to Half Life 2.** 




 She was young, madly in love and probably naive as well.

 




 "I'm gonna give you a clout on the ear". **so hard you'll fly across the lake."**

SearchDE! "clout" 




 Gave my10 YO nephew KSP for christmas. He love building planes. Well. Even I can't build functional planes, but he loads in a stock one, and mods them. Finding out what works and what don't. 

Children are awesome. Trial and Error has made him capable of landing and starting again. I have high hopes for him being the first astronaut visiting Europa. ;) 




 This is the kind of post that makes me and my accomplishments in this game feel so small. 




 I don't understand these kinds of threads. 
Not saying you can't wonder, but I don't see what's interesting about Westeros having food that originated from the Americas.
**There is a wall made of ice, 700 feet high for christ sake.** Let them have their lemon cakes and potatoes. 




 I suspect he will be Bran's tool. Broking a peace between the Others and Westeros. 
Or he will frikkin' kill all the Others with his burning sword. 




 Kings who ate, drank and fucked around is not something new. I am sure he based King Robert Baratheon on some of the old kings in history who has been known to have a few similar traits as 'Ole Bobby B 




 Well. Benjen should be a candidate? 
Maybe TreeBran aswell? 




 'Ofttimes a very small man can cast a very large shadow. 




 Simplifying. Simplifying. Simplifying... HBO fears viewers will go away from that episode wondering "Well, who the hell is Cat?" 

**I think distrusting viewer's intelligence is the greatest crime of television writing today.** 




 Later Dunk sends the smallfolk home, defying Ser Eustace and Ser Bennis.. *"It was if some god had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior"*..

Bred my theory of Bran influencing Dunk. The Castle Wall through weirnet  somehow. Maybe because he is Hodor's grandgrandfather or something.
**"He knew every stone of that wall".** 




 I feel what you write could be true, but not relevant to the story.

It could just as easy be an homage to Tokiens's "The Undying Lands" which lies west of Middle Earth. 




 Em-Com would even be right :) 




 Regrettably no.. I needed to fly past Ike for a science contract and this came up. It was easily corrected but I felt like sharing it because it looks kind of hilarious. 









 You have to read up on the **R+L=J** "theory". There are so much foreshadowing for that theory it is generally regarded as a known fact. 




 HBO makes Dunk and Egg mini series with 3 episodes 




 Robert was the heir to his house, Baratheons are known to be proud. Ned was a second son of the quiet house Stark. 




 Wow Thanks guys, exactly what I'm looking for!
 




 I must first say. I suck at building spaceplanes. I have watched Scott Manley building but it is really hard.

I bit into Career into beta, ship costs are really expensiv. So a cheap reusable ship to carry loads for stations and such would be really handy.

I wonder if anyone here have a good build with stock parts for a shuttle taking of vertically or horizontally with high cargo capability or wants to create one for this purpose would be a Kerbal King.

If it looks like one of Nasa's Shuttles. Bonus points! 




 Volantis is close to Valyria. Well relatively.
They have a lot of experience about the waters thereabouts and know any ship going to Valyria won't return. They knew Tommen II was going to die in Valyria, so they followed him and stole all he had and killed them?

Why not! :D 




 Ordered the book 1-4 moments after seeing episode 10 of season 1. so I knew everything there. 
When I had read aFfC I was depressed, but happily realized book 5 had just been released!  




 Oh my. Are we having **another** rebellion? You must be kidding me. 




 As an honourable man of the North he felt he could be useful at the Wall. You must remember The North look at serving in the Watch as a great deed. Jorah could handle Bear Island (well).. 




 Yes, and that's what she would say should she be in the next season.

http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0265610/

Her schedule is pretty empty, she might appear.
I won't be surprised if they cut her though. 




 Yeah. screw Brienne right? 




 His blog is down? tWoW release for christmas 2014 confirmed ! 




 ** can see why people downvote you to hell...** Should actors have been contacted a script would be done. Then we would have producers already working on it and somewhere along the way it would have leaked.

You will be considered a troll making such statements without a source. And don't say it's because you can't say anything else. This is the internet, not the streets of North Korea. 




 I too have vague memory of HBO owning all rights... :( 




 I think you may be right. Bloodraven is in them though, and Maester Aemon could easily be made fit to make a cameo in the beginning to gather interest. **And I think with the proper title and a "pilot" with many references to characters and events we heard of**, HBO could make people interested in Dunk   Egg. 

**Any suggestions**?

"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms" is actually pretty good.

"A True Knight of Westeros" would be more eyecatching. 




 Sweet summer child. GRRM had the whole story fleshed out in 1995..
It has nothing to do with that. It is the dialogues, the foreshadowing and the subtle hints in every other paragraph that makes these book take so fucking long a time to write. That and the 1500 pages of manuscript each one consist of... 




 Agree on Robert's rebellion.

However I don't feel Dunk and Egg is quite epic enough to make it to the big screen. It's still good drama though with a good climax in each story. As I mentioned in the OP, BBC's Sherlock has a quite fitting way of doing it. With 3 episodes per year each 1 and a half hour in length. 

It could be awesome considering each novella is a separate story still connected to the other two. 




 I am so glad you shared this life changing revelation! It invites to a lengthy discussion indeed!  




 Well. I don't know how to answer that without offending you. 




 Good point. We would get to see how Rhaegar fought nobly and get to know the Targaryen family first hand before diving in to the great history. 




 I would like to see the conquest, dance of dragons and blackfyre rebellions made with the budgets they deserve. Because even though the series-format makes for a dramaturgically better story I can't help to believe the lower budgets that comes with it would basically massacre some of the grander events visually.  









 Barely nothing word by word. But he wrote the whole Targaryen history, too long to be in the book. Elio and Linda shortened it down. Georges version will be published later as a complete history of the Targaryens. 




 Foreshadowing for revenge of some sort I would say! Bran will remember the whole history of Westeros and most likely the whole world, so I doubt I is in regards to that.  




 Wasn't it steel that came with the Andals? 
I feel the first men came with bronze as their main metal, but had discovered iron by the time of the long night, what 4000 years later? 

And the others aren't vulnerable to iron. They just hate it as it is an object crafted by man. 
At least that is how I perceive it.  




 He replied to a comment on his blog once. That's it and I don't see why it's a big deal. 




 You sweet summer child. You know nothing of fear. 




 E-LL-I-O-T? 




 They said it to boost sales. Really lame.
He wrote it 10 years prior to ASOIAF. it can't be set in westeros, because 1981 Westeros didn't exist. 




 I really think Alfie Allen has portrayed Reek so extremely good. He was an ok Theon. But he really is Reek.

I just want him reeling about and rhyme a lot on his name next season and I will be fully satisfied. 




 I consider it an "in-universe history". Most historical things are correct, but description of events crucial for ASOIAF are false or missing.

I got it for christmas (waiting was really hard). And I have read some small portions about the Dawn age and some of the Targ kings. And I must say, though it is exceptionally interesting. The Art is really what blew my mind. Dunk vs The Laughing Storm made my jaw drop. 

**I really (really) hope HBO makes Dunk and Egg into a series. Maybe like Sherlock, with 3 episodes each year about 1 and a half hour in length."**
That would make 3 seasons. 
HBO should prepare for such a series in the Show with Bran somehow. Just hinting at it with something to make the stories intertwine a bit. 




 same here.. 
























 Well you are getting it. October.  




 Hodor 




 There was a comment in one of his recent posts on Livejournal about it. 

http://grrm.livejournal.com/406858.html#comments

I hope there will be comics for all parts in that series. They are awesome. 




 Fucking and drinking. 




 I hate theories about Jon or Daenerys turning to the dark side. 

I mean, I guess it really would fit George's unexpected twists, but I want my heros I've been rooting for, for 5 years now to fulfill their destinies.

Hoping for Stannis turning instead. Now that would be awesome.

 




 (again) 




 I have a feeling that most people interpret Ice as a ceremonial blade only used for executions which I believe is not the case.

And someone please correct me if you have more facts, but Ice was the sword of the Lord of Winterfell, and has been so for thousands of years (new editions coming along every once in a while).

That means if he was going somewhere where he would bring a weapon. He would bring Ice.
 




 Thank you for that! He was a god. 




 Hopefully people know this. 

Every year from November to Mars, Japanese "fishermen" gather in great numbers trapping hundreds of dolphins in a bay, capturing the beautiful for aquariums and killing the rest for meat. Which are served for example in schools... Watch "The Cove". 

You're in for a cry and your hatred for the human raise will multiply by your animal abuse sensitivity. 




 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_garbage_patch

And that's just one'of'em.. 




 So, you will basically be the first one to go? :) 




 I hope they cut the Ramsay wedding altogether. They can put the extra screentime on the Wall with the straw men. 




 Nothing important will happen to a viewpoint character off screen. So to speak. That much I am certain of.  




 He would return to ToJ and get back to wooork!  




 I think you need to be an actor to understand it. A lot of them need to be able to imagine stuff about their character to get into the role. That can be harder if you know more concrete stuff. I'm not an actor, but I could imagine.  




 He's probably  the biggest fan of the books in all the cast. If not just the most enthusiastic. Like hearing him rant about it :-)  




 Some people just don't have the imagination to translate words into pictures in their head. That's it.  




 It doesn't show on her performance.. She doesn't know Daenerys character at all..  




 I want a "fetch me a block"  




 Beat me to it. I go for the Swedish versions. Knatte, Fnatte and Tjatte!  




 One thing is certain. Greece do not always pay their debts. 




 The oily black stone the "Seastone Chair" is made of is hinted to be present in Asshai. I take that as people travelled between the two places. Assuming I'm not thick as a castle wall that would make the world round. 




 Isn't it all but confirmed he is not knighted? 
That was how I read the novellas anyway. 




 Come on. Oathkeeper is more Ice than even Ice was. 




 Brienne will fight fAegon confirmed. 




 An armor made of dragonglass. Now, is that something you might be interested in, Jon Snow? 




 *"In 2011 George R. R. Martin, creator of the bestselling A Song of Ice and Fire  Series, approached artist Richard Hescox with the proposition of creating a huge set of illustrations for the upcoming Subterranean Press edition of his novel A Clash of Kings.  Accepting the challenge and diving into what would become a year and a half project, Hescox was privileged to work closely with Martin who had to approve every image before it could be included in the two volume edition, assuring that every character and detail matched his vision."* 




 They ruined her whole storyline and per defintion a part of Tyrion's when they decided to make Shae **love** him. 

It just doesnt make sense, and this is what comes of tampering with the well thought out story. 




 They are going to be released three at a time this way, not counting when he submits new ones for anthologies. 




 Incoming headlines at websites: "George R R Martin releases his new book in October."

And it won't be a lie. 




 Made me laugh, because I know the feeling. 




 Oh yes! Would be awesome if Dany were the one to come and actually clarify it to Jon himself! 




 Dunk   Egg of the Song of Ice and Fire series. Well, it would be epic either way. 




 But, if Jon is light bringer. This theory stands with Ashara being his mother?  




 I'm a fan of this. Would love it.  




 **I have posted it,** and It's based upon Bran's dying wish to be a Knight, his probable highly magical powers and a line from Dunk and Egg 2. Dunk tells the soldier farmers to return to their homes against their Lords will saying: *"It was if some God had put the words in my mouth, not the warrior"* 

With the theory of Hodor being an ancestor to Dunk going hand in hand with this since Bran can Warg Hodor. 
Also, why begin a short story series along with your main story novels if the events weren't tightly linked and important to the whole plot. Oh, and George love Knights. Check his website.  




 Seems people travelled over the sunset sea from the east to Westeros..
The Seastone Chair was their eastmost outpost, like Dragonstone was the Valyria's westernmost castle.

**Could there be any connections between them? Or the people who created them?** 




 He wrote Tywin's speech about legacy so great(it's just not in the show right?), and since he doesn't have kids. ASOIAF is his legacy. I'm pretty sure he's gonna make all he can to finish it. We just have to keep him safe from harm until he has. 

 




 *We'll have to wait and see!* 




 Read the first book in English and you will have enough experience once twow releases.  




 I started when credits rolled after episode 10 season 1. I just had to know what happened to Arya. the Dragons was cool, but I couldn't wait to find out how she would go forth. And I was not dissappointed!

Reaching aFFC, I could order aDwD which just released in time for me.. **that is now 4 years ago...** Feels like last summer.. 




 Not worth. No battles, desync etc. Shogun 2 was the first playable co-op and was still problematic.
Full co-op for empire would have been awesome though. Glad they developed it further.  




 Reading the books would give you an indication. 

Oh and the theory is bollocks.  




 Something like that. Bit we'll have to wait and see! 

And don't forget the bloody lemon trees and the sunny weather..  




 Regrettably true.  









 Clickbait article that doesn't say anything about TWOW that hasn't been said by Anne Groell or Jane Johnson about a month ago... 




 How would everyone feel if Dunk and Egg was turned into a "Sherlock" style mini-series. 1,5 hour episodes, three episodes/season. 3 seasons. 




 Thankfully, by the time I got to read AFFC, A Dance with Dragons had just been released.. So I had that going for me. 

But that's frickin' 4 years ago now.. Shit.. 




 There were a lot more than 7 rubies on Rhaegar's armor. Who do you think he is? Moon Boy? 




 I don't even have the strength to correct your mistakes. But I will anyway, because I'm a good guy.

**Ned brought Ice to battle** at least once that we know of, which is the Greyjoy rebellion. And it is not THAT heavy to wield. It's Valyrian steel which makes it lighter than a regular greatsword of normal steel. 




 Tower of Joy from Ned's perspective. 




 I'm gonna say what I always say. *Next Winter.* 




 A Storm of Swords is easily the best book when it comes to tempo and content. So many twists and cool stuff happening. 




 Absolutely crossed my mind. I really do hope that's the case.
Means a couple of more years for George. 




 Lyanna's fits in so nicely being named queen of love and beauty. 

But sure it could be Ned. Could be Moon boy for all we know.  




 Whoopsie indeed. You must fit Jeyne Westerling into this too. This is known.  




 I think Reed will tell someone that Jon knows, Samuel might find clues about something hidden in Winterfell crypts.  




 Nah, he probably said "Elia Martell". 

*What do you think about my R+LJ impression?*
I think I nailed the unwillingness to understand several clever hints scattered amongst 5 books and 20 years of writing awfully well. 




 I like Rhaenys! Nice and short but yet pureblood Valyrian.

Dragon names are cool! I looked through tWoIaF and Viserion is pretty badass. 




 Yeah well we havn't found the right ones yet. We want'em vaccinated etc. etc. So no rush :) 




 Well duh. I don't know what I was thinking about. Best Call of Duty map of all time btw. 




 I knew it was coming so I have prepared an upvote for ya! 




 *Only a cat of a different coat*
spray water on it's nose everytime I play the song on speakers. Freud + ASOIAF.
Soon it will run to hide everytime it hears it. 




 They all have to be black in that case though. *The seed is strong* 




 Poison one of them, send one of them off to Spain with strangers and keep one for a pet to do as we please. 




 Oh my.. My flair really is true.. This would be hilariously disturbing. 









 R'hollor seems real, in some way. And I guess the Great Other (Hodor) is also real if that is true. Else I don't know. Seems The Old Gods are "only" greenseers, which are a kind of gods in a sense if they are properly trained and integrated in the weirnet :) 




 You best pay'm back, or they gonna fund your enemies 'til they woop your ass and sack your cities for payment. 




 That one is really obvious once you know it's gonna happen. I don't think a lot of people got it before aSoS, but a really good foreshadowing! 




 Well, yeah. It could be Benjen, Brandon, Ser Oswyll Kettleblack or what the hell.. It could be Moonboy for all we know. 

But this added with the other 20 foreshadowings we have for R+L=J *I'm gonna take the liberty to place it in that file for now.* 




 Those approved would be Ned Stark, Lyanna Stark, Rhaegar Targaryen and Howland Reed, right? 




 I am relistening to Clash of Kings, keeping an ear out for good foreshadowing. Some of them are pretty obvious once you know what's going on.

When Jon is about to chop Ygritte's head off George has planted some real obvious foreshadowing for R+L=J 

 nbsp;

*"He raised Longclaw over his head, both hands tight around the grip. One cut, with all my weight behind it. He could give her a quick clean death, at least. He was his fathers son. Wasnt he? Wasnt he?"*

**Two times?** That's bold of GRRM I would say. It should stand out, but it really don't if you aren't looking for it.

 nbsp;

There's also one in A Storm of Swords where Sandor Clegane to Arya riding towards The Twins is also has a witty red wedding foreshadowing that is pretty well known


*"Keep your mouth shut and do as I tell you, and maybe well even be in time for your uncles bloody wedding.*

 nbsp;

**Anyone else know a witty and/or really obvious foreshadowing that has or hasn't struck true yet?** 




 George on the other hand is doing a spectacular job setting it up. Hear that sceptics? 
*Spectacular!* 




 I think we are going to get the novellas and the main series tightly linked together in the future with the help of Bran. 

GRRM began writing about Dunk about the same time as Clash of Kings came out. There is probably some reason for him writing two stories in the same universe parallel to each other yet to be revealed. 




 Was about to say that. Didn't hook me, but it was a good production value.

I'm gonna say go for Rome if you already saw Game of Thrones. 




 They use Aniston as tBBt use Kayle Cuoco. 




 I'd like it if he got decent with his left hand. But we all know where our hopes end up..  (insert witty quote here)  




 I think he was pretty set on Jaime all along.  




 Tinfoil of the day
 




 Nothing important will happen to a viewpoint character off set.  




 Yes,  my thought as well when I read it.  




 I'd say it will all go on North of the neck. Question is where Dany will come from..  




 *We'll have to wait and see!*

But the north remembers..  




 For me it's Arya without a doubt.  




 Absolutely! He doesn't have clue! 




 IF Bran is controlling Coldhands from the future. I must say my own theory of Bran somehow interfering with **Dunk** becomes stronger rooted. My biggest concern was if it was possible to warg something in the past.

Considering Bran has had a year or two practicing on Dunk's supposed great grandson I am now nearly fully convinced.

If you disagree, read my flair. 




 Yes, this was a joy to read indeed! 




 spank you very much. Dotrice made a change in his voice saying that last line that really caught my ear! 




 Yeah, this is George's way of sneaking in stuff. 
Like *"We might even make it to your uncles bloody wedding"*

Were we to interpret characters dialogue as only straight forward we can shut this sub down until tWoW is announced... 




 That would be *pretty strong* evidence for Aegon being a Blackfyre of some sort. Right? 




 Are there any good theories about the **whereabouts** of the two swords? 




 Yeah, saying he was the best is a little far. I'd put Alexander at the top.
Napoleon had the ambition to match Littlefinger! 




 Cookies, cookies, cookies for you. 




 Lyannas crypt is definitely stone. I am betting that is one arm of the prophecies. 




 I agree somewhat. Some actors get typecasted and when that is done, there is not coming back from that. 




 I do not like Sibel in Game of Thrones. May have to do with the character but some lines are just not convincing. Especially season 2-3.
I don't think she's that good looking either so the porn is really uninteresting. 




 Was **Hinds** really Aberforth? It's funny you should mention it because I saw the final movie a week ago, and I paused and thought to myself: *Is that Mance Rayder!?"* I looked it up but found Jim McManus was playing Aberforth. But it sure looks a whole lot like Ciarin Hinds! (Sounds like him too) 




 If it's something other than A time for wolves I'm gonna be mad.  




 By season 2 I knew she were gonna be big. I didn't think it would happen so fast though.  




 Oh god yes. So good. Hinds is great as Caesar!  




 Oh, and Ramsay Snow is good in Misfits. Those first 3 seasons man. Awesome.  




 I was going to say Jerome Flynn should be the lead in his own series. Seems like he already is though! Might have to check that out actually. 




 The Wolf Hall-post got me thinking. Game of Thrones has some of Great Britains most talented actors. Harry Lloyd is one of my favourite Brits, and should have been nominated for supporting role in "The Theory of Everything" if you ask me. I loved him in Doctor Who, a show that has a great many guest actors that stars in A Game of Thrones which I will list below. Tell me if I forgot someone.

 nbsp;

Tobias Menzies and Liam Cunningham are russian submariners.

Joe Dempsie - Gendry

Harry Lloyd - Viserys

David Bradley - Walder Frey is in Doctor Who and also plays William Hartnell (#1 Doctor) in the movie "An Adventure of Space and Time".

Iain Glenn - Jorah the Andal)

Thomas Brodie-Sangster - Jojen

Diana Rigg - Queen of Thorns

Julian Glover - Pycelle

Jamie Sives, Ron Donachie and Ian Hanmore was all in the same episode "Tooth and Claw".

Lucian Msamati - Salladhor Saan

Mark Killeen - Mero

Spencer Wilding - A White Walker who has played aliens several times in Doctor Who

Tim Plester - Black Walder Rivers

Finn Jones (Loras Tyrell) was in the spin-off The Sarah Jane Adventures

Burn Gorman (Karl Tanner) and Owen Teale (Alliser Thorne) was in the spin-off Torchwood

Donald Sumpter (Maester Luwin) and Julian Glover was in the old Who-series

 nbsp;

**Rose Leslie** has a role in the season 1 of Downton Abbey where she is great.

Any other show or film where an actor from "Thrones" is particularly *shiny*? 
























 To those who say it's more hygienic I respond:

Soap.

And that's basically the end of that discussion even if they desperately try a few more arguments before going away.

 I'm from Sweden, And this live version where the featuring Miss Li breaks down into tears makes me wish you all understood Swedish.

 If it's brown, lay the fuck down.
If it's black, attack!
If it's white. Good night.

Since we only got brown bears. Play dead. And u'r probably good.

edit: To clarify I mean bears.  




 Sweden here. There's actually a small chance I've chased that goose with a pickup truck.  




 He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast and he's gotta be fresh from the fight!

Holding Out for a Hero - Bonnie Tyler

 




 [Age of Mythology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A17oUv0E-N4)

Exactly how you feel playing the game. 




 Let's get down to business!
I've always loved Mulan. I hold it as one of Disney's best along with The Lion King and The Beauty and the Beast. I haven't noticed any cult following.
 




 Jared Leto is my man crush. 




 The more I drank, the more I shat. But the more I shat the thirstier I grew.  




 I have a bit of homemade tinfoil. Noone believes me, but I'm fairly certain there is something to it, but maybe not what I think. Anyway.


Bran climbed the walls of Winterfell so many times that he knew every rock. 

He has gotten better and better at warging Hodor. It will culminate with Bran somehow warging/influencing Ser Duncan the Tall. Thick as a **castle wall**

My theory is rooted in Bran's nagging about wanting to be a knight, people telling him he can't ever be. But Dunk was never knighted!

And a line from The Sworn Sword. when Dunk defies his sworn lord and sends the poor villagers home, practically saving their lives. "It was if some god had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior". 




 Watchmen. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVUDdQS2UxA

I count that as the opening. Even though there's a fight sequence before it. 




 Yes, I am quite a phobic. The one laying at a cliff had my heart racing because we had to pass it closely on the path we were on and the guides were quite nervous which were noticeable. 

The green one and the striped one in the waters were as you say docile, and very beautiful to watch.  




 Yeah that looks exactly like it. I was about 8 meters away, but there was a dude swimming closer with a camera so I guess it was something worth photographing. If so that's one of the most venomous snakes in the world? 




 Oh yeah, this video has one that shows similarity! thanks.

I also photographed another beatiful snake that they told us was harmless. So we were really close to it. http://imgur.com/a/aFdg2


 




 Saw some snakes on an island in Thailand 2009. What kinds are they?

I also spotted one when snorkeling. I don't have a photo but it was around half a meter long, striped black and blue. 




 No, but you buy a lot from Russia to keep the costs down. If you could buy from Sweden it opens up your market which could lead to independece where you can freely choose by your liking and that will bring prices down.


Since you're a member of Nato, an outside powerline pointing away from Russian territories is certainly in your own best interest. 




 People and animals have survived more than one ice age where basically the whole of the northern hemisphere where covered in permafrost. Chances are high both of our ancestors have lived through decades, maybe even centuries of complete winter. 

I think they have gotten used to it and people may die but the rest always carry on. Wow. Story of life. 




 Swedish Jan Guillou wrote the  autobiographical novel "Evil" which movie adaption (2003) got an oscar nomination for best foreign film. 

On Topic: He also wrote a trilogy about late 12th century Sweden. Called **The Templar Knight**

**Short Synopsis:**
An unstable Sweden before it was Sweden. 

In one of families fighting with the present king is Arn who get sent to a monastery as a young boy. There he learn one of the foreign Monks once was a Templar Knight in "The Holy Land". 

About a third of books takes place in an around Jerusalem and Gaza. It tells the buildup to the Battle of Hattin and about the major characters involved in that battle.

I recommend both the books and the movies which got Stellan Skarsgrd and a lot of swedish people. Boys and girls. 




 I think The Trooper is as good a historic lyric as Alfred Tennyson's poem about the same battle.

And the foolish Earl Cardigan spawned out of the aristocratic England still got a mark in history as a frickin' sweater. 




 Have a nice summer folks.
Added 5 songs but only one of them is ABBA. // Swedish guy
(Be Free With Your Love - Spandau Ballet is awesome) 




 Is it just me, or is 10 kWh a pretty low number for a lithium battery? At least in the car? 

 




 HBO owns the rights to Westeros... 

I hope they tie up Bloodraven's past in the show with Bran next season to lay the groundwork for Dunk and Egg. That would be the best buddy cop series ever.  




 Who's got two thumbs and doesn't give a crap?  




 You can't take the sky from me! 




 Yeah. I thought the article was prettty good untill that last paragraph..
But it is no secret that The United States of America has a complicated relationship with religion. 

I guess that's what happens when people don't have healthcare. 




 Rendevous is a bitch. Docking is the bitch's bitch mother. 




 At least the Finns put their foot down when Putin crosses the line.  




 You should watch Neil Degrasse Tyson's Nova science programme about animal intelligence. First 15 minutes is about a border collie that made me think k differently about how dogs reason.  









 I should really give CK2 another chance.. 









 Donate at Nexus or Moddb instead! 




 Awesome with a new theory. I like it, but taking it as a fact that Starks married Others are a little too much, even though it could be so. 




 I hope you have at least tried Mount and Blade: Warband with the mod Clash of Kings?
I would say that is the best playable version of Westeros where you can carve your way as a Hedge Knight to a rich Lord. 




 The Christmas Carol could work. 
Also show her "are you my mommy?"  




 I hate Mace Tyrell in the show. He's such a bottomless character just put there for comic relief. It wasn't even funny in his first scenes. Can't fathom how they carried it into season 5... 




 I feel like upkeep costs are higher for the land owning lords of Westeros than it is in Essos. Slaves and such makes for cheap labour for when it's needed. And Wine is cheap. 




 Their attitude reminds me of "CD PROJEKT RED". Developers of The Witcher.
 




 Thank you whoever made this. 




 Didn't read the Potter leak, and I would not read a leaked half of tWoW either. 




 No. He should finish Dunk and Egg.
I think they are tightly connected with asoiaf story wise. Even more so than we think.  




 I'd go to the riverlands and tell Brienne where the fair maid of three and ten is. 
You're welcome.  




 Especially true when you watch last week's episode of Better Call Saul.  




 The Artwork will make you jizz your pants. And I don't even care that that expression is to old for carbon-14. It is still so true. 

Dunk vs Baratheon is so beautiful it makes me cry. 




 Yes, of course. Thanks.

Or maybe "Et tu, Brutus?" 




 Knives in the Dark. 
 




 You should watch the Hornblower series. Great British naval drama.  




 Not a Number is a nightmare. Every number it comes into contact with will corrupt that number. It spreads like wildfire.

Can result in an entire savefile becoming corrupt. 




 I'm too rookie to help out, but I'm following this project.

I just want to ask, how are you planning to document this? Will you stream important parts on twitch, make a youtube series?

Also, how long will it take between the first launch and the landing on Mars in real time? 




 If you get your money buffer up a bit, you could try trading. Keep tabs on selling prices for stuff. 

Otherwise killing bandits will get you renown and loot money. Renown increases your party size. Build a good mix of party members and set your companions out to higher your right to rule. When it's high enough you might want to try a kingdom of your own.  




 Do you call Breaking Bad - "Breaking Bad"?  




 Swedish: "Sagan om Is och Eld." 

The Saga about Ice and Fire. 

The Nordic countries are really big on "sagas"  




 This is what I've always pictured them as. Glad to see someone else know how this should be done. Please hbo. It's right there.  




 I enjoy watch grrm talk,  but lately I think George have become a bit of a hypocrite. Some people will tear me a new asshole or call me unfair for criticizing him, because apparently he is God.

But here we go.. All he's ever talked about in interviews is how he like to make his readers feel unsafe when their favorite character is threatened. And I have agreed with him. I did feel unsafe reading Game of Thrones.. At least after Ned's beheading. 

But now he's changed perspective completely. Apparently it doesn't matter if you are worried about you characters when you read anymore. Now it's the "journey that matters" nevermind what he has always said before... 

I just think it would be more admirable if he faced the problem with his back straight, admitting this is not an ideal situation, but we just have to cope. 

Instead of changing his point of view to fit HBO's opinion...  




 George wrote one verse and the "chorus", correct me if I'm wrong. 

And who are you, the proud lord said,

that I must bow so low?

Only a cat of a different coat,

that's all the truth I know.

In a coat of gold or a coat of red,

a lion still has claws,

And mine are long and sharp, my lord,

as long and sharp as yours.

And so he spoke, and so he spoke,

that Lord of Castamere,

But now the rains weep o'er his hall,

with no one there to hear.

Yes now the rains weep o'er his hall,

and not a soul to hear. 




 Couldn't you contact reddit to make them kick the troublemakers out the door?  




 Nice, yes as mentioned this is the sub your find looking for astrophysics, I just stumbled in here 10 minutes ago to post a question about time acting really weird between binary black holes. I hope someone with knowledge will sharpen my mind on that topic. 

As for keeping a sub like this growing. Make it look like a sub about astrophysics. Satellites, galaxies, corny stuff like that makes for a great banner together with a well designed logo.

 Keep a steady flow of interesting news, but don't drown out discussions posted by the rest. 

Oh, and I like when the link to the sub's front page in the upper left corner is in an image bigger than the small link I keep missing on my mobile/pad

Good luck with moderating this exciting sub!  




 Cars turning right takes the outer road, if they're going straight through, left or making a u-turn goes through the middle.  




 Made this roundabout to liven up my griddy city center. 
It's one of my few own assets, and I really like how it looks. 

Would like to hear what people think about it!

Workshop link: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=405935320 searchtext=Double+roundabout+with+overwalk 




 Well, taking on the role as the broken record no one wants to be. I would have played good money to see my friends witness Lady Stoneheart. 

At least it's not definite she's cut. 

Also Bran's first dream where he flies and sees the whole world.  









 This should be a feature. That's one thing Sim City made pretty good. Recycling plastic and metals for use in factories was awesome. Especially in big educated cities this could be a huge profit. Sweden import trash from Norway to benefit from this. 




 Dunk   Egg Spinoff. Please just do it. 




 **There should be an easy way** to see if a specialized building is producing raw material or manufactured goods. 




 The Show is on Netflix. At least in Sweden. The new seasons are on the internet if you look hard enough. 




 Una Mattina by Ludovico Einardi from The Intouchables.  




 I'd argue saying a word of mouth wheel like this where streams spread the word makes for a tighter community. People watching streams are often active on forums such as reddit.  




 Same here.. At least for the chill gamez like KSP, Total War, etc. 




 Since trees are a resource I am sceptical it will be implemented into the game. 

You can already place trees ingame though, but not by brush. 




 Great idea! Land value could be a way of controlling education-level provided. 




 If they manage their expansion-development mainly focusing on adding more features, leaving textures and modelling largely to the community they could keep this game alive for years with people keep buying expansions. 




 I don't have a good sense of reference because I'm only active in a couple of subs. But how many subscribers are that for a game releasing in 3 days?  




 Probably means he's gonna lose an ear. (hope I got that twin right) 




 I love her in the first season. She has suffered from bad writing as a result of them trying to recreate "Dracarys" over and over.  




 Are you German or is that word taking root? The English language has been missing it for to long.  




 I'm ten minutes in, and I find your podcast really interesting!

I admit I haven't listened to many others before, but those I have tried has not caught my attention. 




 Agree with your order completely!  




 tuung 




 I need to see that one. Sounds like me watching the show with my unsullied friends.  




 The paning through the images feel a bit off sometimes. Try zooming out from faces, keeping the attention on the characters. And the voice the reader does for Dunk is horrible. 

Otherwise the moods and everything feels great. I can imagine the process to be quite time consuming, but I could see this as a nice way of enjoying the story though copyright will most likely take it down.  




  In theory.  




 I call bs on all news twow that doesn't come from grrm himself.  




 I think they should wait for multiplayer.. It would really boost sales.  




 I find let's plays without narrating a bit pointless. But I understand, it's hard to find something to talk about and I think Scott Manley got it right with the "New me" and "Old me". That way you can put voiceover where you blabber about pointless things, say something stupid. Or such :) 
Also, fastforward your launches. I get tired by just watching my own, again and again! ^^

Anpther tip is to do a better description. List your mods and stuff and do a short summery of what the episode is all about. 

Otherwise I really liked the video and the creations. 




 Rhaegar were firstborn and therefore heir to the throne, if Jon is his trueborn son by a secret marriage (I doubt it)

Jon would be next in line (if Aegon is fake)  




 I'd take the liberty to say that the garrison's morale would improve slightly if food came after nearly two years under siege.. 




 I do it to free up my hands for other stuff. It's great to just put on headset and do some dishes while you listen to the battle of the blackwater. (did that today)

Biking to school, grocery shopping. Well. All tedious stuff you have to do becomes enjoyable. I discovered time goes a lot faster while you're concentrating on a book than it does listening to music. 




 The hour of creature is just common saying. In Swedish for example we have "vargatimmen", or "the hour of the wolf" which is the hours just before dawn. 

 




 Short film based on a poem by Terry Bisson. 

Two aliens sit in a diner discussing the human race. 









 Great with a new fleshy interview! 




 Hey, that was awesome! Both text and music!

 EmergencyAwesome is the most generic and robotlike youtuber I have ever come across. I have seen a lot of his aSoIaF-videos, and wow.

He really is proof that anyone can be a youtuber if you work(edit) hard enough. And I can respect that! 




 Yeah! I think I noticed that line to when reading the comic. Dunk   Egg are so underrated. 




 hear, hear. 




 Yeah, Tyrells are like Italians.  




 wow.. this will be so lame. as tthorn23 said. Buy the strategy board game instead, prefferably with Feast for Crows expansion pack. 









 Took me about 12 hours to manage the same. But I had a dude guiding me when I needed some help. Congratulations on your accomplishment! 

The amazing feeling you felt when you landed will happen again, and again and again. That's the beauty of this game! 




 Ari Gold. He would probably be king or the Castle.  




 Well, it's the three released novellas released with artwork on every page. Not a comic but an illustrated book. 




 It is known.  
























 Do you think HBO is going to let him do that? I'm not sure. But I sure hope. So many of John Oliver's most important topics is exactly what Bernie wants to talk about. 




 Yes that's right. Still more than the entry-level pay of most jobs.
Parental leave in Sweden is pretty sweet. 




 I'm being serious..  




 Just Do It...

No, wait. That's not Visa. 




 People using the imperial system. 




 It sure as hell is a pretty extravagant income. Remember, you already payed for school, medical care and a lot of other stuff with your income taxes, so those 4300$ a month is only for living. 




 When my z-5500 died it was just the fuse. You probably have checked it already, but make sure to do if you haven't. Would have saved me a lot of time if I had found it first.. Good luck. 




 Hi! I wonder if anyone out there has any experiences in old radios and how to get them working again?

It's an old swedish model, I found information about it on this site: http://www.radiomuseum.org/r/luxor_r192b.html

I found it at my grandfather's summer house and wonder if there are any way of getting it to work?

As of now I believe the only thing missing are the two batteries. 
Pictures: http://imgur.com/zhXj35a,WbkUF68

Thanks in advance. 




 Of course it's not going to be even. Not on elite levels where physical strength is going to be vital. 

But a fucking high school match game? In that skill level there are lots of girls that could play the shit out of boys in soccer.  




 It's so simple. Ask the two girls: "Do you WANT to play against the boys?"

If the answer is yes. Then what's the fucking problem?
It would be disrespectful not to play against them in this case.

If the answer is no, you respect them by not playing. 




 There sure were vikings in Sweden as well. My home town of about 50 people is said to have been the seat of one called "Hagwulf". And is still named Hagwulfsroom. With places around it called "burg hill" and "raven hill".

But most of the vikings known to have raided west were danes and norwegians since they were on the west side of the strait. 




 How could they not give her community service?  




 He's so fucking mean. I frickin' love him. If you don't appreciate the humor of him or Rudy. You will definitely hate the show. Also the London suburb accent and slang is awesome. 




 Yeah, he can convince voters himself. It didn't take long for me to get really interested in what he had to say. And his background and voting history reaching back to the 90's is just outstanding. 




 And a lot of them has donated money to "The Clinton Foundation".. 




 Jamies pulls off a glorious escape while Bronn does something heroic and die, dead, dying, deadsies, deadwood. Your choice. 




 I think he's feeling even more Hurt now. If possible..
http://imgur.com/BpHmj8T 




 I believe he's gonna visit every state. 




 Nazi Zombies - Ammo cheat. There's your infinite slamfire.  




 Blah. Blah. Blah blah 




 AKA "Trench Gun". 




 a-ok :) 




 Some sort of metal in the core is good for the electromagnetic field though. No? 




 Nice, that's a beast! I had a little problem with IR as well. Never used it before.

So, I wanted to make a version of Serenity in KSP with as few mods as possible. And after two hours of building and refining this is the first version that I was able to land with, without experiencing a rapid unscheduled disassembly.

I wanted to share it and I hope it inspire someone to make a better version. I'm a rookie when it comes to replicas and building stuff for fun in KSP and I know there are really talented engineers out there.

edit: Oh, and don't forget to turn on unlimited fuel and monopropellant. 




 "It's too expensive to turn away from fossil fuels".... 




 Also it kills White Walkers. 




 The system and the economy as it is makes 99+ % of the new income go to the top wealthiest 1% of the people.

Bernie want's to raise taxes for the very rich to get funding to pay for the new infrastructure that could generate more than 10 million jobs.

As well as pay for college and healthcare. 




 It really is. This studio version has a translation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_UagTUwAt4

I think Miss Li is crying because she is moved by the lyrics, and also the participation of the audience that is breathtaking at Lars's concerts. 




 Same here. And later from 10k to about 6. 




 I'm sure he doesn't want to affect ordinary people with this. Have to ask him what transactions are gonna be taxed. Because I'm fairly certain only big wall street firms are the targets.

 




 It's a 0.01 tax. It's not gonna amount to much if you don't trade in hundreds of thousands. Millions of dollars.  




 Yeah. 0.01 tax on sales will be a huge blow.... 




 Yes. For the people. How will 0.5% tax on big Wall Street taxation affect you? 
You will get free college education. That's how you will get affected.  




 Maybe because some Americans believe college tuition can be nearly "free" as in a lot of other major countries?  




 The money in politics.  




 It is your privilege in a representative democracy. If you don't vote you don't care.  




 He hasn't taken money from corporations or millionaires/billionaires. EVER. 

And his voting record speaks for itself. He votes and introduces legislations that align with what he says.  




 Join in at /r/SandersForPresident  




 He voted against it from the start.  




 Someone got berned.  




 Alright. Interesting. Do you think he would name Warren, or is there someone else I do not know about?

In any case I think Warren will run for POTUS in 2020. And if Bernie doesn't reach all the way she can pick up the momentum his campaign is sure to get. 




 Swedish dude here, and I feel the same. The integrity of this man resonance across the Atlantic. I hope Swedish media will begin reporting on his politics when the debates start. 




 Kul med en annan svensk som tagit upp intresse fr amerikansk politik i och med Sanders.

I'd say he lines up good with the swedish Center and the Environmental Party. The American right wing is so far right we can't even see it on the political spectrum in Sweden. 
Although Sanders is fighting to introduce legislations and systems that has been in place in Sweden for many, many years (public healthcare payed for by everyone through taxes, and free education tuitions)
 




 I am pretty out of touch with American politics, but Elizabeth Warren and Bernie is on the same page more often than not. 
If Bernie becomes POTUS Warren is most likely to become VP imo. 




 This is one of the reasons Sen. Bernard Sanders is running for president.
Billionaires think they can do whatever they want. 




 That's the spirit.. 




 Hopefully a loss against Hillary in the primaries will have paved enough way for Warren to run next term with a steadier ground to stand on. 




 No reason. But what we want is exposure and awareness. And we're not getting it from the media. 




 bern* 




 "They'll burn you alive"

"Bad way to go" 




 There should be more focus on his voting record, and practical results of those laws. The facts speak for themselves.  




 Then you should register as a democrat in the primary and vote for him so that he can get a chance to make it to the election! 




 If we had listened to Sanders, we might have avoided the economic crisis. Fat chance to see that headline in mainstream media? 









 Are we getting word out about this on other forums and subreddits and not just here on /r/sandersforpresident? 

 




 Do you think Sweden, Norway and Germany has good healthcare? They do. And that's because it's government funded and therefor directly payed by all the people in that country.

How can you say that doesn't work?  




 In Sweden the largest (as of 2014) political party is "The Social Democrats".

Social Democrat is a better word for the politics we adopt in contrast to the pure marxist socialism which we are not about. 




 To the top you go. That last bit should be the campaign slogan. He votes like he talks. And he introduces proposals to make things better.  




 For once abolish Citizen United which basically gives billionairs the right to donate hundreds of millions of dollars into the election process pretty much buying candidates. That is called Oligarchy. Look it up.  We are gonna have Hunger Games if this continue long enough..  




 I think Bernie need big names with recognizable faces to reach certain kind of people. 




 I have had the same thought about Elon Musk. I feel he is pretty neutral when it comes to politics though. And all his money are locked in Tesla and SpaceX 




 Nasa, and private space companies who are their contractors.  




 In the big AMA of I hope. It's got 8 million subscribers.. 

Should we get together and come up with some good questions?  




 John Oliver should take a look at him That would get more young people aware. 




 Sweden's biggest political party (might have gone down since the election in 2014) is called  Socialdemokraterna or "The Social Democrats".

That could be tied in with his talk of Scandinavia as an example.
Also a question: What do "I note the abscence of a qourum" mean? 




 I sent a Swedish translation. Go Bernie. 




 Nice thanks..

Oh, so 150 million total makes almost 75 million who doesn't vote. I think voters was 56% or something. 




 Only 52% of americans vote. If he could reach hefty sum of 150 million potencial voters it would be a grand slam.

Why don't more people vote by the way? 




 Why don't young people vote?
In Sweden 2014 85,8% went to vote. 
I see now only 54% voted in America.. :( 









 He's running for the democrats though? 




 He's independent. Running for the democrats because running as independent is basically impossible.

 Humans are animals. Animals are our way of saying living creatures that aren't the same species as us.

 Every answer on this sub should look like yours. 




 Yes it's possible. There are a lot of rogue planets out there, some have formed separately and some have been flung out of their parental solar systems. 




 No. They don't weigh the same. No need for more explanation. 




 The faster it grows, the more carbon it uses. 




 No they don't. The atmosphere is incredibly thick and the transition between gas and liquid are slow and the change is gradual the further down you go. Most gas giants probably have a solid core though. 




 If you're interested in this stuff, and the universe as a whole I can highly recommend you taking 10 hours to watch [Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2395695/?ref_=nv_sr_1).

And I'm fairly certain others will agree. 




 Interesting thought. I'm fairly certain feelings for the sexual partner weighs in somewhere. 




 Living on the sun compared to living in empty space with no stellar bodies "nearby" would result in 66.4 seconds difference per year if I interpret Schwarzschild metric correctly.

 Generally species that produces a lot of offsprings at once does not care about them as much as those who produces fewer does. For natural reason. 




 Robb married her because he was naive. He was so obviously seduced by the Westerlings and tricked into marrying Jeyne. After which Tywin is completely certain she will not bear a child because her mother is giving her moon tea in secret.

I don't think Jeyne was aware of this and her love for Robb was probably genuine. 




 No one knows when it's gonna be released.
Especially not Amazon. 




 Is there any way of watching the Sky Atlantic interviews in there when you live outside of UK? 




 Yeah. The argument is empty anyway. Those who circumcise do not do it because it's more hygienic. They use that argument to hide the real reason. Which is religion. And aesthetics....
Female circumcision is foreign for me. It is complete baloney. 




 It's not my blog. I just ran into it and thought the amount of debates was shocking. 




 I'm not american, that may be relevant to know. But Sweden had a 2 hour long debate tonight with all 8 party leaders. I think it shows a lot when some politicians try to answer the questions with a straight face and some will always try to steer the discussion in another direction.
Debates and interviews in the states often results in party leaders making a joke when asked a serious question. 




 N/A doesn't mean that there were no debate. It means they didn't have a number for that. 




 Wow! That's awesome! I really like the style!

some critique is healthy though and I thought about two things.
The horse was the only thing I noticed that wasn't great in the artistic side.

 I'm not saying every reason. But if you consider that New York went so far as to pay for plane tickets to get rid of their homeless, you soon realize the problem must have been substantial.

 I agree. Although Linda seems to let her emotions run wild even once in a while. I do the same, but it's a bit different when you are such a public figure.  




 When people get emotionally invested they gladly give money. But a system where health care is free for everyone, not just the one who get a lot of attention by going viral? That's un-American.

 I loved this growing up. Doktor Mugg is a Swedish television series, named after the program's title character. The series takes place in the fictitious town Dasseborg (Outhouseburg) and revolves around toilet humor, mugg and dass being colloquial terms for toilet in the Swedish language. Other important main characters are Kapten Filling (Captain Skivvies) and Walter Closett.

Doktor Mugg tries to force the citizens to buy his invention "Pruttomobilen" ("The Fartmobile"), a mobile toilet.

The show is about a villain trying to make people buy his own product "The Fartmobile".

 Vrlden kommer inte att hlla om det ska fungera s fr all evighet. Den kommer iallafall inte vara en vrld jag vill leva i om den fortstter i samma riktning.. Men misstrsta inte.
Alla generationer har kmpat mot ngot som verkat helt overvinnerligt. Om det s var kvinnlig rstrtt, rtten att lska vilken person man vill oavsett kn, svartas frihet eller frmgenhetsklyftan s har det alltid funnits folk som sttt upp fr det som varit rtt. Ofta mot alla odds. Med mngder av mnniskor som psttt att de aldrig kommer lyckas. Men de som sttt upp fr rttvisan har vunnit till slut. Efter att mnga har kmpat sig snder och samman har vrlden till slut blivit en bttre plats.

Att stta sig ner och tjura r inte rtt instllning. Inte heller att frga hur det ska gras. Problem r till fr att lsas. Och det kan vi inte gra p Reddit. Vi mste tala om detta med mnniskor. Det mste bli ett mne som ligger p folks tunga och vill gra sig hrt.

**Detta r min sikt** 




 r det inte dags att frska gra ngot t det istllet fr att ge upp? 
Jag r s jvla trtt p att g till ett val och rsta p en politiker jag gillar. Fr att sedan upptcka att det inte blir ngon skillnad ver huvud taget. Och om det blir det r den s marginell att den knappt syns om man tar hnsyn till konjunkturfrndringarna.

Frra ret gde de 1% rikaste i vrlden 47% av vrldens tillgngar. Nsta r kommer den siffran ha stigit till 50%. Det borde viftas med flaggor, men alla gr till sitt jobb 7-4 och ltsas som ingenting. 




 I'm sorry. And of course you didn't. I did not mean it personally. I recognize your username and you have posted some really good ones. But this one wasn't one of them :) I did not mean to offend you. 




 Grattis. Du r den frsta som frsker starta en diskussion istllet fr att plocka sakfrgor i min text och gnlla p dem. 

Nej, det r klart att det inte r ltt. D hade det ju redan realiserats.
Och jag vet om svrigheterna. Det r inte en slump att Kamprad satte upp en stiftelse och avskrev sig IKEA juridiskt redan 1982. Han vill behlla sin kosing. Det kan man frst. Till en viss grns. 

Det faktum att den hr diskussionen inte finns i Sverige ver huvudtaget, trots att vi kkar gubbens kttbullar varje mnad. Det r absurt. 

Om diskussionen fanns skulle man kunna gra ngot. Men den finns inte. Jag har inte hrt media prata om frmgenhetsklyftorna i Sverige och inte minst i andra delar av vrlden dr problemet r s fatalt att jag blir livrdd.. r detta vad mnniskan ska sluta som? En girig gubb/tantjvel som ska stapla sina pengar till mnen och tillbaka? 

[volymen av en frmgenhet i dollar](http://www.pagetutor.com/trillion/calculations.html) Vilket gr det lttare att frst hur mycket pengar det handlar om. Och kom ihg att vi snackar tiotals miljarder dollar hr fr de allra rikaste. 




 Och nu ser jag att du varit redditr i tv minuter innan du skrev detta. Allts....... Jag ger upp.

Vi uppfann elden fr hundratusentals r sedan. Dags att ndra vanorna **nu** nr vi vet vad som r bra och inte bra.

[Om du tog och slog upp fakta](http://www.ekonomifakta.se/sv/Fakta/Energi/Energibalans-i-Sverige/Energitillforsel/) S skulle du veta att krnkraften inte str fr lika mycket som du tror (eller jag trodde fr den delen).

Det kanske inte kommer leda till srskilt mycket frre jobb att marginellt hja arbetsgivaravgiften. Men faktumet kvarstr fortfarande att regeringen valde att hva in den strsta delen av budgetunderskottet frn anstllande fretag. Istllet fr att ta frn de som har mer pengar n de, deras barn eller deras barnbarn ngonsin kan gra av med om de inte verkligen frsker bli av med dem.

Jag hoppas att det r siffrorna som frvirrar folk. Och att de har svrt att greppa hur mycket pengar en miljard, fr att inte tala om 10 miljarder kronor r att ha i fickan. 




 Jag brukar inte vara engagerad. Men efter att ftt upp gonen fr hur det ser ut i USA har jag insett att vi lider av samma symptom. Det r bara att vi redan hade gratis sjukvrd och fri utbildning, m.m.m nr det ekonomiska klimatet ndrades. De kan inte bara berva oss det vi r vana vid p en gng. D skulle vi ju kmpa emot.

Jag r fr hjd elskatt! P sdan el som *direkt* inte r bra fr naturen. Kol och Olja har en s galet mycket strre inverkan p naturen **nu** n vad krnkraften har. S varfr inte hja den som r vrst?


Jag r livrdd fr krnkraften. r man inte det r man inte frisk tror jag. Och jag vill inte ha ngra nya reaktorer, men att beskatta den istllet fr andra kllor som r vrre r i min mening helt jvla idiotiskt. Krnkraften r iallafall inte dlig fr oss nu. Kanske nsta vecka. Men kan vi inte se till att vi verlever imorgon frst? 




 Jag hller delvis med dig. Debatten mste tas upp, och budgetens *strsta* kning r markerad migration. Det r ett problem. Men snlla. Stirra dig inte blind p ["inandningen"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lcRQfzDXBs) som Robert Gustavsson hade sagt.

Det r ett **marginellt** problem, som anvnds som en ljuspekare fr en huskatt nr matte ska ta rkor och dricka vin.

**Snlla.** (Jag sger ordet och menar det) Kan vi inte ta invandringsfrgan i en annan trd?

Med det sagt ska jag agera hycklare. Och frklara varfr invandringen **egentligen** inte r ngot problem.

Vi skulle ha rd. Vi skulle ha rd med att lra upp ALLA invandrare. De skulle kunna f lra sig svenska och f fullgod sjukvrd. 
Vi skulle kunna hja lnerna fr lrarna. Vi vet att vra grundskole och gymnasieutbildningar r p vg ner i rnnstenen. Statistik ljuger inte. Vad sgs om att hja lnerna fr lrare, s att kvalificerade mnniskor knner att de inte kastar sina framtida pengar i sjn fr att utbilda sig till ett av de dlaste yrken som finns och istllet vljer att bli ekonom. (jag lser programmering, hade velat bli lrare)

Vi skulle ha rd med allt detta och lite till om vra nationalhjltar vi alltid hyllar, som startat IKEA, Hennes   Mauritz, Tetra Pak m.m m.m skulle komma ver sitt begr att behlla varenda krona (som de sklart har kmpat jvligt hrt fr. Iallafall de flesta av dem) och komma underfund med att en mnniska och hans eller hennes familj inte behver ha flera miljarder kronor att rra sig med. Man blir inte lyckligare av att ha s mycket pengar. Det r vetenskapligt bevisat (ett uttryck som vattnats ur och frlorat sin slagkraft. Men tnk p vad det betyder).

Vissa av dessa fretag har flera gare, med tskilliga miljarder (20-30) i frmgenhet vardera.
Mnga av dem str skrivna i London, p Bahamas och andra platser dr de p ett eller annat vis antingen slipper undan skatt eller behver betala vldigt mycket mindre n hr i Sverige.

Allt fr att ha 12 Miljarder kronor p kontot istllet fr 7 miljarder kronor.

(Kamprad har ver 500 miljarder kronor. Snart 2% av de dr 40 000 miljarderna alla skojar om. Hela jvla tiden)

 




 Du borde ta en titt p de senaste opinionsunderskningarna dr han kat med 20% de senaste tv mnaderna. 
Men jag antar att du ser p Fox News.
Chansen att han vinner primrvalet r sklart osannolikt. Men det skulle vara det bsta som hnt dem p vldigt lnge politiskt.. Antalet lagliga mutor politikerna i det landet tar emot r bortom all reson.

Jag tycker inte att det rcker. Inte fr de som har mer pengar n de kan gra av med. Jag kan frklara fr dig varfr. Men det mste jag gra efter jobbet fr det har jag inte tid med nu.

Grnsen r vl inte fr mig att bestmma. Men 5 miljarder borde vl rcka gott och vl till en familjs frmgenhet? Hur mycket mer pengar kan man tnkas utver 5 miljarder kronor? Kan f betala 2-5% mer i skatt? Eller det kanske skulle resultera i att ekonomin kollapsar igen.

Nej just det. Det var de som faktiskt gde ofantliga summor pengar som fick ekonomin att krascha. Det glmde jag. 




 I need someone else to enter this discussion. Troll or hopeless case? 




 De enda som svarar p en sn hr trd r sdana mnniskor som verkligen inte hller med. 

Den nya budgeten - jag vet inte om jag ska skratta eller grta. r detta vrt vlfrdssamhlle vi s ofta skryter om? 
De Rdgrna - Socialdemokraterna, Miljpartiet, och vnsterpartiet har presenterat en budget som gr mig rdd. Klarar du att lsa min text med ett ppet sinne beundrar jag dig fr jag brjar bli osker p min politiska stllning sjlv. Men om du eftert inte delar min sikt. Svara att du tycker jag har fel..

I budgeten finns mycket gott. Vi ska f bttre infrastruktur. Jrnvgen behver verkligen renoveras, och det verkar vara p gng. Dessutom tycks snabbtg mellan Oslo och Stockholm bli av. Vi fr fler utbildningsplatser, satsningar p vrden. Slopning av lxhjlpstillskottet som inte verkar ha hjlpt ett dugg och istllet satsning. kat underhllsstd. Allt som ska ske verkar jttebra.

Vart kommer finansieringen ifrn? Har man beskattat de miljardrer vi ftt fler av n ngonsin i Sverige de senaste ren? 
De som tillsammans ger 1 120 Miljarder kronor.

Nej. De behver inte betala hgre skatt. Den strsta delen av finansieringen kommer frn arbetsgivaravgiften fr unga. Som nu r tillbaka p samma niv som innan den snktes. De som kommer drabbas hrdast r allts de som har en liten omsttning och vill anstlla. Jobb kommer frsvinna
Krnkraften ska beskattas. Det r ocks en punkt. Jag r neutral till krnkraft, men man kan beskatta krnkraft fre kol och olja nr ens koalition har frgen grn i namnet gr mig frbi. Detta kommer drabba alla svenskar. Elpriserna kommer hjas. Och vilka kommer att f lida mest? Vanliga mnniskor sklart.

Jag r inte en politisk mnniska. Men jag r inte helt krd i huvudet. Ska budgeten godtas av alla som rstade rdgrnt? Ska det s kallade arbetarpartiet hja skatten p *arbetare* istllet fr att hja skatten p dem som bokstavligt talat skulle kunna bygga sin egen pengabinge?

I USA har en fr oss i Sverige helt oknd Senator och presidentkandidat ftt ett sdant genomslag nr han talar om frmgenhetsklyftorna att han p allvar hotar Hillary Clinton i opinionsunderskningarna. 
Och vi i Sverige mrker inte att vrt ekonomiska klimat lutar mer t USA n vrt eget Sverige nu fr tiden.

Och kom inte med att det blir Alliansen nsta val. De kommer inte gra ngonting bttre de heller. 

Jag vill hra folk sikter. Slpp vilket parti ni rstar p och frga er sjlva hur man kan hja avgifter och skatter p sdant som drabbar gemene man *istllet* fr att beskatta, **inte de rika.** Utan de snuskigt rika. 

Vad r skillnaden p 60 miljarder kronor och 50 miljarder kronor i en frmgenhet? 

Samtidigt r invandringen allt vi pratar om i politiken. r inte detta ett villospr vet jag inte vad som r det. 




 




 Yeah. Seems like good system to try to make it easier for politically engaged to try and balance the scales of your broken elections :)

I'm glad I know about it now. 




 I don't see why you shouldn't just donate directly to the Sanders man.
Isn't that "safer" and gives a largest percent to the man you want to have the money?

edit: I read up on the ActBlue. U're goooood. Seems like something I should've known about.  




 What is your profession and stuff? I could compare with what you would get payed if you were swedish. 




 Hell. Even illegal immigrants without papers are guaranteed healthcare in Sweden. I think you're good if you work and pay taxes my friend. 

I am realizing more and more how awesome my country is.. I rarely visit the doctor. 




  [Good. He is the one we all need.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpzgXVA8eh0) 




 You're completely right. It was a really bad outlash, but you have to realize. Although I have probably missed fights. This very, very rarely happens. And the fact that Nicki Pedersen is the one getting a (lame) punch is so not surprising it actually surprised me because why hasn't it happened earlier? About a hundred times. 




 What's in it for me? I'll get rich in the land of opportunity? 




 I haven't watched this booring sport since I was 14, but I grew up with Speedway once every two weeks. 

I knew, and everyone knew danish rider Nicki Pedersen didn't play a fair game. He does everything to win. He doesn't care if it takes a little bump into someone's front wheel when passing them. (sometimes he actually seem to aim for it) This happens more times because of Pedersen than anyone else in this sport. 

And yesterday one of the most respected people in the sport, American Greg Hancock gets enough of the dane's bullshit and loses his cool. Both of these riders are 20 year veterans. Legends that have both won Grand Prix several times.
 









 I came to write that. Easily the best speech I've seen. I shed a tear and I'm not even a little embarrassed to admit it.


I want to adress /u/Vermonty_Python 

: This last speech needs to be saved and cut into a new professional video. (that first bit should be cut out or be put last) And you need to inform Bernie that some version of the speech about the 80 billions the Koch brothers are worth. And how much THEY think is enough is repeated by Bernie. Often. He need to get into details more. Facts and details are gonna win him the election.
 




 ""If she's against this, we need her to speak out, right now. Right now," Sanders said. "I don't understand how any candidate, Democrat or Republican, is not speaking out on that issue."" 









 Now that's a real article.

The one from MotherJones is getting the most votes and it isn't bad either. Short and concise. 









 Well. You just got another follower, so I hope it's gonna even out.. I won't comment anymore because I think Bernie's stance on negative attacks are spot on and not needed. Also, I imagine the circlejerk (which I participate in) here is even worse than in /r/SandersForPresident. But I will gladly upvote a post if the link is a serious source with a good point, because the fact that america might have another Clinton vs Bush is fucking terrifying. :) 




 Hey, get a flair :)
I'm sad there isn't one for Sweden.  




 Did this politician basically shush people cheering to get his political policy heard? 

I want people to find a video of another politician doing that....

edit: Honestly. Just when I thought I had heard everything this man had to say, thinking he is the politician with most integrity I've ever seen. Bernie surprises me again..

And as a non american I have to say. America's culture of constant cheering at speeches is really weird.  




 Of course not. But this is a so called "what if situation". 
edit: If you're an american you should be very familiar with what ifs. Since you're a socialist in a not so socialist country. 
I can say, honestly I voted red in my country. So don't you deflect shit. Answer my question instead of acting like a teenager. 




 I know it got something to do with beer. 

lol. Understood some. Are you basically saying ActBlue is not very good because it gives most of the money to Bernie but keeps a little to pay for their own personal shit?
I'm asking because I refuse to cheat. 




 I just want to add. Thank you for learning a Swedish fellow maybe the best saying I've ever heard. In any language really. 




 Jag hr dig broder. 




 I hope you're right. But I think you overestimate how many people actually click on the articles concerning politics.. 




 And if (on the slight (slight) chance) that Sanders would win the primary nomination? Just vote for someone else but him or a republican? 




 This is awesome. I totally agree. A big win for Bernie. But this article is so biased it shouldn't reach the front page by any means because the journalism of this dude is unprofessional and emotional. And that puts this whole sub in the wrong light. There are other posts on the same subject. Upvote them and downvote this. 




 I'll be a little surprised if you want. But I'm not.... 




 Hey guys! I'm from what we jokingly call "The Welfare State". And I got news from Sweden that might help in getting a grip of what extended social benefits might mean for the economy and how to formulate the benefits of a stronger social welfare program. I believe there's some ammunition here to counter disclaims on Bernie.

**What the budget raises support for:**

support for single parents

More employees in elderly care

6 500 new spots for higher education

Infrastructure

Local climate investment Support

Scientific Research 

Commercial Stimulation

Use google translate's function where you can translate a PDF to read it in english. It looks awful, but the translation is good. Not perfect but good.

The raises in welfare programs are for now mostly payed for by slightly higher tax on nuclear energy (which provides almost 50% of the energy) But higher tax on fossil fuels and on capital gains are proposed and will enter into force in 2016.


**Swedish guys** If this is interesting for the sub. We could translate this document in 30 minutes each. Probably less.



Also the fact that the budget passed makes me proud to be a Swede. The opposing block forfeited regarding the budget to let the sitting "house" pass the vote.

 




 I'm not an American but a Swede so I'm not really that into your politics. O'Malley sounded good on an info site, but when I look at his voting history he has vetoed a LOT of good legislations that I skimmed. Considering my recent history in this thread that might not mean much. But for example [this one](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:S.296:) That forces drug manufacturer to inform the Secretary (whover that is. But I guess Secretary of Health or something?) when there is about to be a shortage of one of their drugs for MORE manufactoring reasons than discontinuing the said drug.


Did I misread this too, or is that a realllllllllly good legislation O'Malley vetoed? It would give sick people more time to find a substitute drug? But I guess it would hurt companies profits.....

Living in Sweden, enjoying "free" healthcare and education payed for by the country together I think you guys could use some Bernie Sanders. But I heard 'Murica is a free country. Of course you should vote for a politician representing your beliefs. Whoever that may be.
 




 Phu. I think you focused a bit to much on the first line of my sentence, but yeah.. If one person don't get my point for whatever reason that's all the reason I need to rephrase.
Sarcasm really do come across really bad in writing... 




 Nice one. Who do you plan on voting for in 2016? Or haven't you made up your mind yet? Or are you from China?  




 Yeah I saw it. Fuck.

Yeah. Reek's chapters are a joy to read. So.... How about Stannis huh?.. D D basically spoiled that one too in a "behind the scenes".. 




 EDIT: **Noticed it**. Oh boy. did I have to eat that one up with a side of shame and some shame on top. I'm not deleting this comment because I'm not that ashamed. Even though I should be.

Oh boy. you didn't read the article, but just read the top comments?
The article clearly states that [Clinton's Financial Disclosure] (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/16/us/politics/document-hillary-clintons-financial-disclosure-form.html?_r=0) (You can read the stuff yourself and see.) shows she and her family made 11 million dollars from speeches that are not accounted for in the "Clinton Foundation".

I expected someone who watched Game of Thrones to be a little clever at least. Considering Tyrion is your favourite character (lucky guess?) :)

 




 I love you autowikibot. If you were a real person you would be... Well. You would probably be Bernie Sanders because you really do know what's best for ME. And you do what you say you do. And you do it so damn well. I honestly had no intention of clicking that link :( And I feel really ashamed.  

Reading that made me realize there are a lot of people out there who think the same. They just don't know who to vote for. 




 Hillary actually lied? "I'll be a little shocked if you want. But I'm not." 




 I'm never leaving. Not even if Russia gets a little to (un)friendly.

On topic: What your're speaking is truetrue. I think this is the stuff Bernie will advocate a lot when he gets more attention. He apparently changed Vermont a lot for the better. (According to himself of course, but I don't think he would win by such a long stretch and for such a long time if he didn't deliver.) Maybe some Vermonteeers should get together and make a video about what Vermontians think about Bernie and why. 




 I changed my phrasing. Better? 




 I truly salut you. You and your brothers and sisters may well be the people who save the world if this thing takes hold (exaggerating for effect. [Or am I?](http://www.cnbc.com/id/102759742) It's not just the US...). I'm from Sweden though and I thought America was doomed. I'm not really about to uproot my life anytime soon and move over there. Especially since I already have free healthcare and an education I am enjoying very much. 

I feel like I'm part of this by spreading the word here. And in related posts on reddit. Even though it's bloody hard. People are so stuck in their mindsets it's scary.

I'm thinking of getting engaged in the board of my condo. Don't know what it's called in english. But if they don't get enough people engaged it will turn into a rental. And that would just add to the inequality. So at least that's something..... 




 I'm just quoting those who mindlessly agree on something. If they really do think it is bullshit why not explain why they think that way?
If I'm mission your point. Please do elaborate. I would like to understand you.
And sorry if my english is bad. It's my second language.
 




 People just downvote what they don't agree on. I'm trying to start a conversation about how the rich are making more and more money while the group of people with less money are getting less and less. Do you not think that is a good discussion to have?

I'm not by any means poor, or come from a poor family. It's just my honest opinion.
If people don't agree with my opinion they should write why. Not press the down arrow. 




 I'll be a little shocked if you want. But I'm not. 

"It's literary fame"

longest EDIT in history: We really need to make this a thing. Joe is genuinely surprised. she is trying to make it look like he's just up because New Hampshire is close to Vermont. Sure, it's partially true, But I'm fairly sure New Hampshire is pretty on to the politicians being a what'sitcalled.


It's gonna be the best steal of a quote when Bernie wins this whole thing. (Trust me, I'm slamming the wood with both my fists for those who believe that sort'a thing)

Also. You must pull your hair for making a typ-o in the headline on this one. But I get it. You're as excited as I am. 




 If yo somehow try to rationalize the increase in inequality. My guess is you watched too much news. 

Because most news channels gets a fat paycheck from the ones making the big buck. (yes, duh, and how this was allowed to be spoken on the largest station in the world is basically a miracle) 

I'm telling it straight to the ones who are stubborn (usually a good trait, so don't dispair)

**It's never too late to come to your senses.**

edit: Starting with bad phrasing, read more in the discussion. Also, my own bias. Also. Do you downvote this you are just a mindless drone, a bot or a [re-he-he-aaaly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2MPoqqzwdY) stubborn person. Because the proof is literary in front of your eyes. 




 It really is "funny" because it's true.


[And Oppenheimer would have said it again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb13ynu3Iac)

Scary how well it fits this scenario. 




 That makes to much sense. I think this may be why I slur sometimes as well. Do I think faster than people or do I just not slow down my speech enough? ;) 









 I'm with you. Either there's right wing douches who downvote everything with a different opinion or there's something shady going on.  




 Of course they are. Comcast owns NBC. I don't think Comcast favors Bernie in the White House. 




 As a Swede who didn't know this I must say.. I'm a bit proud...  




 R you serious?  




 For people on the spectrum. Sarcasm. That's how politics work in 'murica. Land of the Free, Home of the Brave.  




 Yeah it's one of those rare cases where it's not about the ratings. 
Are there any truly neutral, large media stations in the US? NBC is owned by Comcast if I'm not mistaken. 




 I mostly agree.

The whole baby drama... And Caputo's journey from a social hero story that were really engaging, but ends up basically saying: "fuck worker unions, go for the top yourself and screw everyone else".. **I don't get it.** Is that the message they want to tell american workers?

I have gotten som hysterical laughs this season though. Probably more than the previous two. 




 They still use fahrenheit? That's probably what caused the end of the world. 




 Jeb Bush's not the only presidential candidate who has a lot to explain. 




 Not at all.. And now even The Pope has acknowledged the dangers of the ongoing climate change.

Many republicans are slower than the church. For christ sake..

 Tror du kungafamiljen r fattig och lever p bidrag?

De fr ju sklart kompensation nr de representerar Sverige dock. Precis som alla andra "tjnstemn". 




 Verkar som att mnga tror att kungafamiljen lever p vra skattepengar. Vilket sklart inte stmmer. 
Jag r f. likgiltig till monarkin. Frstr bara inte vad det stora problemet med den r.

 




 If I might take a minute and steer your red herring back to the subject. Hoarding rationed water is basically as bad as hoarding food/fuel/whatever in wartime (very, very illegal)..

But hey. Instead of starting a discussion on this important topic, the top rated comment is a joke on a fucking name?

Reddit has truly sunk to a new low. 









 Sg en dokumentr p SVT hrom mnaden. "The Super Rich And Us".

Visar tydligt hur teorin "Trickle Down" verkligen bara r rent skitsnack. Och problemet r s sopat under mattan av massmedia av sjlvklara anledningar att de flesta inte frstr hur stort problem detta r. Vrlden ver. 




 Why don't you take a look at the interview. That dude is crazy.  









 [you should make one of these](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/94/f0/cb/94f0cb21bd56b93e42b4e712200eced6.jpg)  




 Imagine an economically strained person not needing to save money for college or pay health insurance. This is the reality for people in countries who enjoy "free" public university and universal healthcare. Their personal wealth would get a huge boost due to this. 




 You nailed the test. Full score. 

Btw. People seem to downvote this post because of the headline thinking I agree with Bill "The Shill"  Clinton.  




 Damn onions... This will be my go to video when someone asks me if I'm a cat or dog-person. (I love cats, but dogs are something else entirely.) 




 "Anybody who's still really close to their best friend in grade school is by definition trustworthy"...

EDIT: To clarify I absolutely don't agree with this madman's argument. Has this guy really been president?  









 That hive mind is frightening. She doesn't say anything about what she wants to do, and yet the cheers are constant.. 




 Spank you very much 




 He's an atheist? Didn't know that. Any source?  




 Wait a minute. What the actual fuck are you on about.  




 The thing about text is that sarcasm doesn't come across all that well. You should try to speak plainly.  




 No need to apologize. I find that most people on Reddit/The Internet in general get really heated in discussions. Which there is no need for.

In my opinion a competely socialist state is not something to strive for. But socialism has a lot of aspects that are really good for both the economy and for the workers in that economy. And that is something I think USA could benefit from. 




 What? Me? Don't cry wolf. I'm just expressing my opinions just like everyone else here. Just because I don't agree with you doesn't mean i'm not a real person with my own opinions.. (Trying really hard not to be rude)

EDIT: I just realized maybe you don't know what a shill is. 




 No need to be passive aggressive. Maybe my point wasn't clear. I mean there should be a healthy amount of competition between production companies so as to encourage innovation and low prices.

The problem with absolute socialism is that it doesn't work. There needs to be some kind of a free market, but it should be more regulated than it is today in America so as to ensure that the workers aren't abused.
 




 And meanwhile the politicans making those decisions. Introducing the bills and legislations have gotten millions in donations from corporation to fund their political campaigns. What do you think was said between the donors and the recievers?
"I give you this, if you do that" 




 It's not about economic growth (which btw is a term used in propaganda). 

It's about that 99% of all new money in USA goes to the 1% that is already the richest.

My question is: How much more do the richest need before it is enough? 




 I'm a Swede, we've been ruled by democratic socialists for the better part of the last 100 years and that is not how we or any other sensible country I know do it. To me your suggestion sounds really dumb. Nothing personal against you. 




 Take a closer look at the politican in question and you just might change your mind. 




 That's just genius. Sadly even shoving it in peoples face isn't going to make them change their minds...  




 YOU! You go to the top. And you stay there. You hear me?

Also. Your name is the definition of appropriate. 




 Completely agree!
Although I think other animals might be really intelligent in other ways than we expect.

On the alien topic. Not a chance in hell we are going to find intelligent alien life. Maybe life on a cellular level.
But if there is intelligent life out there it is going to find and contact us long before we would find them. 




 I see that's your opinion and you are perfectly entitled to it. But I don't agree. 




 You gotta remember Daniel Vavra, writer and director of Mafia 1, writer and designer of Mafia 2 is not working in Mafia 3.

Doesn't mean Mafia 3 is gonna be a bad game, but it's probably gonna be different from the old ones.

 




 That's deep man. 

On a more serious note, not as deep as I thought. But I have never dived 7 meters.  




 He might be the best monster creator in TV which is hugely important.  But his female characters has roughly as much substance as can fit in a free perfume bottle. 

 




 I think that needs to be repeated where people can hear it.. 




 I thought he was gonna make them a [Cocktail](https://youtu.be/XZsiY9S4WpI?t=26) 




 So it's you. The fun guy at parties.

Although the joke is on you. I would find it hard to swim down to the depths where the pressure is that high since i'm not an experienced diver.

Someone who knows the science may do the calculations. 




 Hillary need to speak out on this right now. She hasn't said if she's for or against it. It's getting absurd how any candidate, especially the one polling so high can cop out on an issue like this. 




 I wonder how it will take for humanity to realize it's not the only conscious being on this planet.

We want to find and talk to aliens, but don't realize we got aliens right here. We just need to develop a Rosetta Stone... 




 How do you know a car is from Poland?

The Polish! 




 Or elect someone out of the corporate system.
