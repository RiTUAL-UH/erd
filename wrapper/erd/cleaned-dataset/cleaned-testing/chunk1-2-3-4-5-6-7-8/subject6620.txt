 Best looking vehicle with a Subaru badge on it. I've got to go back to [this] (http://www.motorstown.com/imgs/18020-subaru-svx-2.html) in order to recall any other Subaru as visually stunning.  




 You should drop Mendenhall. There has got to be another way to fill that roster spot with someone that doesn't register 0 each week. Time to start scoring some points, man. 




 Being that you're in Chicago after all [unlawful intent can be presumed] (http://thefiringline.com/library/blades/knifelaws.html) 




 Not the most exciting roster spot to add, but consider the Cardinals D/ST. They shut down Vick and the Eagles weapons last week, and are going up against a struggling Miami offense. 




 Livable wages   fair medical benefits would be the first of a number of reasons. Unionized commercial food workers can make around $16-17 per hour for the jobs that Walmart workers get paid $9-10 an hour for.  




 The ice rink at Millennium Park would be a great option in late November. Zoo Lights in Lincoln Park = free. Ride the Ferris Wheel if the two of you aren't afraid to shiver a little.   




 Perhaps the Gangster Disciples near Division   Pulaski should consider moving to a more friendly community. So many of their neighbors are of the insane/maniacal variety. 




 Any game that the Hogs play against the Wolves will either be televised on Comcast or MY50 for Chicago locals. The way AHL's scheduling is structured that's probably 8-10 games this season 




 Sometimes stickers come in cow shapes and chicken shapes too. That's protein for ya!
 




 Perhaps Cutler could be more of a said bitch if he went to play for the Wings and remained a mediocre defenseman on their squad until he is 67 years old. 




 This has got to be one of the lesser liked Illinois or Cook County cops. They gave him a 2004 Malibu!

 I find it more offensive that the Canucks are #3. First, their logo can simply be classified as stupid. Additionally, the huge VANCOUVER letters are obnoxious. Lastly, they borrowed the color scheme from the 1990s Seahawks. #3? Seriously? 




 For most of the mid 90s until about 2006 these jerseys were about the only thing the Hawks had going for them.  




 What did the 911 call sound like?
 




 It's a bit crazy. I've thought about proposing some trades for depth. Trading away the guys that you drafted early makes no sense though. Why pick a RB/WR1 and not show the confidence to keep him on your roster? 




 Looked at the title too fast and thought "He bought steak at Giordano's!?" ...but hopefully this helps the owners get it together.  




 Guy is alone because of the Detroit Vipers jersey.

 Saddest moment in Berwyn history: http://chicagoist.com/2008/05/03/berwyn_spindle_1.php 




 Gone are the days when the Wolves were the only independent club in the IHL; I miss that. It's partly said "business" and partly the growing emphasis on the AHL being a developmental league. It seems that the number of veterans a club is allowed keeps shrinking. 

But with an impending lockout there is a great deal to be excited about this October! The roster will be stacked, and Wendell has brought Haydar and Sterling back together too.    




 I second this. The wolves are more of their own entity than most AHL teams. 

As far as the Ice Hogs go... thanks for Andrew Shaw. Nothing else positive to say about that organization. 




 Terrible luck!
 
If you go to Velasquez   Sons they can replace a catalytic converter way cheaper than most. It was 2006, but I got one for $90 parts and labor.  




 Even funnier is the ad box on the tribune's page: 

"Single? Meet local older women for free!"
 




 AHL gets no coverage in the states either. Chicago Wolves are the only team that televises all of their games, and it's local coverage only.  




 Way too much credit being given to Americans with this. This is assuming that they know of at least 10 countries in this region and can identify their shapes. 




 AHL during the last lockout was damn good. Guys like Vanek   Cammelleri ,that normally would have made NHL squads, played and tore things up. I remember watching my Wolves get destroyed in the finals by a team that featured Patrick Sharp, Jeff Carter, Mike Richards, Umberger, Nittamayki, and more.  




 Since it is a 2-way deal they should be able to. 

The circumstances were different in 2004-2005, but young NHL players like E.Staal and Spezza went down to the AHL after playing full seasons in the NHL. 




 Not over Sproles. Even though Sproles may get less than 10 carries, he has the potential to grab ~8 passes and rack up big yardage. Gerhart my get the same amount of touches, but his ceiling isn't nearly as high.  




 For a 10 team league this is terrible depth at RB.  




 Satisfyingly evil-looking.  




 Is it? Shouldn't it be "woman's best friend." Not "women's"
Nobody is saying "men's best friend." 




 So I'll refine my question and eliminate the loaded term "genocide." 

What is the proper historical legacy of Japanese war crimes (and crimes against humanity) that included: mass killings, human experimentation, biological warfare, and undeniable torture during the time period I mentioned?

How can we diminish the importance the potential lowest point humankind has ever reached. The actions of Japan during the 1930's and 1940's brought about what is perhaps the most widespread suffering the world has known.

 Wish I had been alive--or they would bring back--the NASL. Hockey fans would love it. MLS just is not that exciting. The NASL was able to lure big names like Pele and superstars from Europe. Plus they had probably the most intense post-regulation elimination shootouts.

 Or... keep it; instead of a 2 min penalty being assessed to the goalie, he becomes a skater who is allowed to handle the puck. However, being that he is outside the trapezoid/ goalie zone, the rules should allow for him to be bodychecked within the rules of checking any other puck-handling skater. I know my grandpa would love to see this, he suggests this every time he sees the damn trapezoid on tv.

 I guess you need to look at economic/social trends in Eastern Europe. I live in an area with a high population of new immigrants from Poland. BMWs, iphones, and flashy clothing is very ubiquitous among this group. (much different from my Polish relatives who came here ~100 years ago, who primarily came in a wave of lesser-skilled labor)

A number of the 21st Century immigrants are probably coming here for work because of their technical or specialized knowledge.

 I've been used to working 55 hrs a week for a while now. Draining work for sure, but I've got to imagine it's only about 4 months. 




 Thanks! This sounds a lot like what the job climate/ lifestyle is like for my uncle. I am definitely going to seek out his point of view as well. 




 Not incredibly random. I have a family member who is successful in the field, and have seen some of my college classmates transition into the professional field fairly soon after graduation.

It really takes a special kind of person to become an MD, and it really only pays more in the long run, considering that 4yrs of medical school + being an intern + the cost of school-related debt and malpractice insurance etc., etc., ...I cannot imagine that most MDs are making good money until they are past 30.  




 As is the case with many of us who are fresh graduates. Does an internship necessarily mean that you work for months in the field w/o getting paid? Already did an "internship" while student teaching, where I pretty much took over a classroom for 4 months, having to work nights and weekends w/o my university or cooperating school district knowing. Hoping not to get stuck in that situation at this point in my life.  




 Here is my situation: 24 y/o BA in Secondary Education; BA in History.

After two unsuccessful summers of not landing a full-time position as a history teacher, I am planning to do something more practical in place of the subject that I feel passionate about. The economic incentives of being a substitute teacher or a private school teacher are non-existent. I make more in my current position at a reading clinic/ my union weekend job.

From a purely practical/economic perspective, does it make sense for me to jump into a Masters of Science in Accounting program? 

It seems that the opportunities are more bountiful in this field, and if I strike out at landing a teaching job next year I'm probably going to give up anyway. Assuming that I can complete CPA certification, I probably can use a family connection to help me land a position in the accounting field. Just wanted to know if there is anything beneath the surface that would make it equally difficult for me in this field.

Thanks!

 Great start for Eddie Lack. This is his year to show that he has what it takes to play in the NHL. Anything less than an all-star nomination will be a disappointment.

 Pick up Richardson if possible. He fell an eyelash short of 100 yds yesterday and had just 13 touches (11 rushes, 2 catches). Plus, the Rams are probably going to part ways w/ SJax at the end of the year, so they will probably give him a good deal of work in the near future to see what he can do.

 **[ENTRY]** [Pontiac Fiero GT] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:FIEROi2.jpg) Why? An American mid-engine two-seater from a defunct manufacturer that is made almost entirely of plastic and has a weird cargo section near the engine, no bonnet (hood), and still has a cult following. 

Get Clarkson in one of these, would love to see his reactions to it.  




 [This video] (http://www.empireofsoccer.com/flashback-vid-the-nasl-shootout-new-york-cosmos-v-washington-diplomats/) shows the intensity and suspense that were present in NASL shootouts. The league really had a few glory moments. Pele came to the New York Cosmos, and for a while fans were thrilled and passionate. 

I watched the movie "Once in a Lifetime" the story of the New York Cosmos, and it seemed like the league could have created a whole new soccer experience for Americans.

I wasn't alive to experience the NASL, so my question for those who were is this: Why did it fizzle out? 
 




 Soccer is and has always been my favorite sport, but I honestly hate matches that end in a draw. [The NASL concept] (http://www.empireofsoccer.com/flashback-vid-the-nasl-shootout-new-york-cosmos-v-washington-diplomats/) to end matches had to have been such a suspenseful and awesome experience for fans though. I just wish that this concept would have caught on on a bigger scale, because no true soccer fan likes watching matches decided on penalty kicks. 




 The tie is a dead concept in the NHL with the dawn of the shootout. 




 This kid was quite the sniper for the Rampage a few years back. Such an abrupt and unfortunate ending.

 Wayne. He's red hot and getting a plethora of targets. NYJ are not playing good defense at all.

 Hell yes. A truly International Hockey League? The old IHL (RIP 1945-2001) only had one team, Soviet Wings, outside of N.A. for just one season.   

This would open up so many opportunities to see different styles of play   really good players who never fit into the North American style of play.

 Considering that most of this car is made of plastic, and that V8 is sitting right in the middle of it, you've got a very quick little ride there. 

I cannot look at this too long though, it's making me sad. Why it had to end for Pontiac while soulless Buick keeps on living is a reality I do not want to accept. 




 Consider the Mazda 3. Consumer Report is saying that it is a great buy. The new "Skyactiv" engine gets the best fuel economy in its class and is actually more fuel-efficient than Mazda's subcompact Mazda 2. Additionally, the long-term costs are projected to be low considering the trends of the Mazda 3's build quality and reliability over the past few years. The price is not that much different than the Cruze or Focus either.

I wish i was in the market for one today. 
























 That block on the Forte run was responsible for 6 points as well, don't forget that!

 He WAS the reason why the Bears went 13-3 back in 2001. I remember more than one game-changing interception return from Brown during this season. Talk about a guy that brought such intensity every week, going all-out is why he had so many injuries, and when he would get injured you could see how much it frustrated him to be on the sidelines. We miss you, Mike Brown. '

Edit: Confirmed info: Brown had two walk-off interception returns for TDs during the 2001 season.

  Picking Charles at #7... I'm happy to say that I was able to do the same, shocking as it may be. 




 If I remember correctly, there was a model called the VL that was lower. It had a 2.0L instead of the 2.2L in the RS. Also, it was missing those badass white wheels, and Rally Sport trim. 




 1991 Chevy [Cavalier RS](http://carphotos.cardomain.com/ride_images/1/3093/1221/7730610002_large.jpg) Owned this car in high school/freshman year of college, and actually drove it from 2005 to 2007; which is shocking, because today it is one of the most egregious vehicles that I have ever seen let alone owned. 

The car was sort-of white and featured electric blue and black trim along each bumper and exterior door panel. Giant electric blue and black letters saying "CAVALIER RS" bedecked the driver doors. The Rally Sport edition that also had painted-white metal wheels. Mine was literally falling apart. Any parking lot where I closed my door was sprinkled with rusty dust. 

Then, literally everything on the car broke. Someone slammed into the driver's door in high school, so that didn't open. The power locks broke, so I was forced to climb through the trunk should I decide to lock the doors that actually worked. No A/C. No Heat. I came out of class one day to notice that the exhaust system had literally snapped in half, and  I dragged the pipe down the street going a top speed of 30mph with my gas pedal to the floor. 

The good news? I sold it for $100 in '07.

TLDR: The 1991 Cavalier RS is an incredibly shitty automobile.  




 But... these shirts were on clearance. 




 So, this is in Mexico? 




 It's a fantastic looking car. However, keep looking for someone willing to fall in love with it if you want top dollar. Despite the car being out of production, there seem to be plenty of them in the used market; I don't think you will get a ton of calls if you're pricing it over $20,000.

 [Here are a couple options through DC social sports.](http://dcsocialsports.com/leagues/soccer?state=LIVE locationId=) The co-ed league is more at the recreational level. (Although the teams I have played for had some really great females on them). The men's league is much more competitive. We play at the Long Bridge Park soccer fields, they are synthetic turf, and lighted for night games. Plus, the league usually has a bar component where everyone goes out and drinks post-game. 




 Will do; thanks for the resource! 




 I have been offered a position to teach middle school social studies in DC. After just speaking with my principal in passing, she said that she would like to sit down with me and discuss the "scope and sequence" for the 7th   8th Grade social studies curriculum next year. From my research, I'm picturing that this is a long term, big-picture framework for district wide lesson planning. However, she mentioned that she was not satisfied with the last social studies teacher's "scope and sequence." Which makes me believe that I may have to do some collaborating with her to make the overall, big-picture framework. 

Of course, when I sit down with her I would like to appear like I know what I'm talking about. So, if those of you out there in r/historyteachers-land could give me some information on what I can expect to talk to her about I'd greatly appreciate it! I have seemed very confident in my interactions with her thusfar, but she is a bit intimidating (Columbia Teachers' College grad, and also a big history nerd). Just trying to avoid being sent to the social studies teachers' graveyard like the last guy. 

[This is the only example I was able to locate online](http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/Files/downloads/In-the-Classroom/How-Students-Are-Assessed/Grade%207%20ELA%20SAS%20SY13-14.pdf)    

Thanks!  




 Also, that Focus is very fun to drive. I had to drive a friend of mine home once in a Focus hatch from this era, and I was very impressed with its pickup and handling. Probably had all the same features as yours, but she had hers shipped here from the Netherlands, so it gave it an extra cool factor. One of the most fun cars I've driven for sure. 




 It is a rare rear-wheel drive beast. However, this guy had [the last of the Grand Prix GXPs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pontiac_Grand_Prix_GXP_.jpg) 




 Just found this! [It's never too late, man](http://www.recycler.com/details/24681296) 




 Not necessarily stupid though, more of a sad trade-off. The area I moved to last winter made driving my Pontiac far too laborious. I got a "smarter" car that saves me money on both fuel and VA requirements. However, it lacks the special feel of driving the Pontiac. 

I was going through a quarter tank of gas every day working in DC, and then I find out that Northern VA has a 24-point inspection for road safety. (My driver's door didn't shut properly   power windows didn't work among some other issues with the power steering) All in all, I sold it in MD for $4000 in exchange for a friendlier DC driver (the Elantra). 

In summary, we aren't making "stupid" decisions, just dealing with the reality of the increasingly Pontiac-less motoring world of today.  




 your rant is completely justified. I can't even tell you how many people had the same criticism of GM about the frankly dumbass choice of preserving Buick. The consumers need to let their voice be heard. Time to put the soulless division of Buick to sleep and resurrect the excitement that was Pontiac!!!!!!
 




 I feel you. I had a Grand Am GT Coupe that I bought when I was 19, and I just let it go this past February. Let's not credit Pontiac for making the best quality cars; but Pontiacs did inspire a certain feeling for those who owned them. It was certainly a car that I was excited to drive.  




 let's hope. Front end looks majorly improved. 




 $33, not too big of a deal  




 Well put. Although, I wish all my neighbors their just reward for not being a great resident of Alexandria like myself.  




 Yeah. Plus, it isn't very much anyway. I've paid 3 times as much for "city-stickers" before. Guess I should have made the association that city-sticker=a source to generate revenue for the local gov't (aka TAX). Initially, I was taken aback back by the term "vehicle property tax."
 




 I've been in Alexandria for about six months now, but after buying a car in FL, and then switching over to VA license and registration I have paid the "vehicle property tax" and posted the sticker on my car as proof. 

Here's the thing, less than half the cars in my neighborhood have City of Alexandria stickers on them. I'm noticing that a number of the ones that do have stickers also have out-of-date ones. Is the vehicle property tax just something that isn't really enforced in AVA? And am I a sucker for even paying it?

 Unfortunately, I didn't get to experience the concept of the "two hour delays" that can happen here in the schools that I work in. (I would assume more snowfall needed.) The reactions are certainly different than the midwest; I remember having to walk to high school with 16 inches of snow on the ground in Chicago. I think my school had one snow day every 40 years. 




 Just moved here 1 month ago from Chicago. The top two things I miss are: 
1. The Blackhawks
2. Being able to order Giardiniera on things

I'm not about to jump on board with the Caps, though. I think we'll be lucky to see 5-6 Hawks games on local tv in DC this year. Such a shame, because this team is going to tear it up this year. 




 Got to love that car. Is that a Ford Aspire, Donovan?
 




 Raffi Torres for sure. 




 What about the [Dodge Daytona](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Daytonashelbyz.jpg)? It looks like it was built on the same platform as the Starion; much like the Mitsubishi Mirage was to the Dodge Colt. 
 




 Hondas and Toyotas have the best reputation for reliability; however, in your price range you can expect six-digit odometer numbers. I think that you may be able to find an Elantra with 60-70K miles on it.   




 Yep. Darryl Drake. 




 So what's up with Shaw then, just 1 goal on the season so far?  




 Thank you. From what I read in a guide to teacher certification reciprocity, it seemed that 3 years experience was almost a requirement to have my certificate recognized in MD.  




 Thanks! This is very helpful, I haven't really sought out the charter school opportunities in Chicago too enthusiastically, but I'm probably better equipped to take on those challenges now than I was a year ago. I'll definitely investigate. Any insight that your wife could provide would be greatly appreciated.

 Please tell me what is the job market for teachers like in the metropolitan area? 

I am moving here next month from Chicago as part of a project that my current employer is doing. However, I'm a certified teacher and haven't gotten a classroom in IL due to an insane disparity between many applicants and very few openings. (not to mention widespread district cutbacks, etc.) I'd love to teach in DC or northern VA. 

So redditor-educators of DC, what type of climate should I expect? Are there any districts that you know of that I should target? Do you know of any paraprofessional/teaching-aide positions that may be opening up in the near future? I'd love to get my foot in the door, and would be open to ditching my employer to make a positive step in obtaining my goal of teaching in the classroom. 

Any suggestions or advice would be much appreciated.

Thanks!!

 I watched this last week. It will give you a snapshot of what gang life was like at Cabrini Green; however, the Venkatesh book will go more in depth about how massive housing projects like the Robert Taylor Homes bred a community ruled by gangs.  




 No way. Is that the sequel to Snowicane?  









 Yep. It's funny because there are like 4 people that live in Rosemont. But everyone has been to a concert/convention there at some point.

 Leave Tom alone, that was meteorological research for your information. 




 Make a short trip west on North Ave. Al-Mart has some quality mattresses and beds. Just got my second one from them. The first one I had was so solidly built that I needed a hacksaw to get it out of the bedroom.

Also, ask about free delivery; if you're in Humbolt Park you'll probably get it. 




 Thank you for clarifying, sausage king.  




 But is it *actually* Q101? ...Not yet at least 




 These pictures are actually pretty funny. All the players look exhausted. Kruger just looks confused (much like everyone else who heard he was on team Sweden). And at one point, Oduya and Hossa must have said. "That's  it we're done wearing shoes!"

That aside, this is going to be the highest caliber hockey since 2010; let's just hope our 10 hawks play well and don't get hurt.

 Gary is such a sad story. There were 180,000 people in Gary 50 years ago. Now there might be 75,000. About 50% of their kids are graduating from high school. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm going to assume that crime is out of control. I just moved back to Chicago after living in DC for a year. I stopped in Gary with my big clunky u haul, and was immediately approached by the gas station security guard. He seemed curious to know why I chose to stop there, then warned me it was a bad area. It just struck me as desolate. 




 no argument about that. so I'll just be a good Cubs fan, roll over and cry about how a Sox fan was mean to me again. 




 True. I'm ripping on Sox fans for their historically poor attendance.

 If you really love Hemingway you'll enjoy the place. I do remember going here on a field trip though. Some girl passed out because it was 95 degrees  in there. My teacher hated Hemingway, and later apologized for the trip being a part of the curriculum. There was a guy who was about 100 giving the tour, and I think his name was Jim Christmas. He was pretty hilarious.

For what it's worth, visit the Hemingway foundation across the street. There are some cool samples of his writing from way back, including a description of a football game that he wrote in 9th Grade at OPRF. Hemingway got an F on it. 




 Wait, how can people take a tour of "murder castle" if the building was destroyed long ago? I'm almost certain that the post office in Englewood occupies it's space today.

 That was my first championship. Had LT and Chad Johnson, when he was simply referred to as Chad Johnson.  




 Ha. I'm in DC and moving back to Chicago in a week. That is supposed to be a really good place to watch a game. Hockey News wrote a few years back that there really aren't bad seats there. Just make the trip, man I never made it up there while I lived out east, but it should be worth it.

 I was taking my students back from a field trip when all of this was happening. It was pretty disturbing for the community to hear about a gunman's presence, and disorienting for the students who were blocked off from moving west down East Capitol. 









 That is surprising. When he was in town playing for the Wolves a few years ago he was kind of a waste of roster space. He made no contributions offensively or defensively and lost every fight. 

But here's to hoping he has a run-in with Bollig today. 




 Incentive? 

Yes, this could work. As long as it is structured and serves a purpose. 20 minutes per week of reading current news stories and listening to music is a way I reward students if they meet the expectation. (All assignments attempted, no behavior referrals, no excessive tardies, etc.) 

Also hype up your incentives. Once a month, I'll raffle a Chipotle/Subway gift card to a student who has no missing assignments, no behavior referrals, and less than two tardies.

 I think the rivalry should get hyped with the Jets too. You've got 3 ex-hawks (Frolik, Ladd,   Byfuglien) + playing in Toews's hometown. Should be a recipe for some exciting hockey.   
























 Ghana, Portugal, and Germany are all tough as hell matchups. You've got to love that rivalry that has developed with Ghana in the last decade though, they just have our number. That June 16th game is a must-see.

 I guess this will have to do now that they've discontinued *Gringo Bites* 




 I think some of the goalies that they lit up would be considered abysmal by Today's standards. So while they were a dynamo, let's look at some of the stats from the eighties with a level head. It was a different game back then.  




 I guess they both were; but the Cincinnati team did have Kunitz, Corey Perry, Bryzgalov, and Bylsma the previous year.   




 AND... Coached by none other than Scotty Bowman! I was only 4 but I vaguely remember my dad getting frustrated that they just owned the Hawks in the Finals. I re-watched that series last summer, and man did they ever dominate.  




 A bit off topic but how about some of these rosters from recent memory in the AHL? 

[Philadelphia Phantoms](http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/teams/0007932005.html) Patrick Sharp, Mike Richards, Jeff Carter, Umberger, Seidenberg, Pitkanen.

[Cincinnati Mighty Ducks](http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/teams/0009592005.html) Lupul, Ryan Getzlaf, Chris Kunitz, Penner, Glencross, Coached by Danny Bylsma. 

 




 How about the Oilers!?!?!?!

Sure goalies were crap during their reign, but [take a look at this 1983-84 roster!](http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/teams/0000411984.html). In addition to GRETZKY (87G and 205 points) their top d-man, Coffey puts up 40G and 126 points! Kurri, Messier, and G.Anderson all with 100 points. Are you kidding me?  




 *Don't TOEWS me, bro* 

-Granlund 




 Hjammer really is Slalom Ninjasharks back there. Blocking shots with his throat, what *doesn't* he do. 




 I think the FLYAHS were the only one he got wrong. 









 Right, and I think that Jones did an excellent job explaining this in the link above; my point was not to look at the "white flight" aspect so simply.  




 I wouldn't say "spot on". It's more complex than that. He attributed the "white flight" of the 1940s to white people of the Southside feeling disenchanted with living next to black people for the simple reason that they didn't like black people. 

However, this perspective doesn't take into account that a lot of white people left the city in 1968. Things were so incredibly screwed-up that Chicago wasn't safe for many white people or black people. Mayor Daley was ordering the police to shoot rioters on site. White police treated blacks brutally. Some blacks treated whites brutally; there were people attacked on the streets because their skin was a certain color. Whites and blacks were both the victims or racism. This was the year most of my family members moved out of the city, including my grandfather who was told not to show up to work without a gun during the riots. He worked in a factory. 

These charged-up feelings have persisted for years and carried over to later generations. My dad used to deliver tires on the Southside during the 80s. He was put in a lot of dangerous situations including one where bat and club-wielding guys surrounded his truck in an alley shouting "Get the fuck out of the truck white boy." So, he went to his supervisor (who was black) and told him that he had to send a black guy on that route for his own safety. 

So it's easy to say that the "white flight" was based on arbitrary dislike for black people; for some, however, the charged-up emotions that have scarred groups of people for decades are too much to live with day to day. That isn't to say that I don't empathize with those stuck in the impoverished neighborhoods.

 I found myself in a similar situation recently. I actually needed to move 700 miles back home due to the declining health of my future mother in law. I was as professional and honest as I could have been, and my administrators took note. I also offered my help in finding a highly qualified replacement candidate. 

I gave them a clear picture that this decision was based on my commitment to family. It was by no means an easy decision for me and I felt sick about it for weeks, but all three administrators showed empathy and professionalism. They have been my biggest advocates for getting back into the classroom. It is hard to feel confident about a decision like this, but as long as they saw your talents and are decent human beings it should not be an inhibitor in your career.

 Forest park may be a good option; Oak Park may be stretching this dude's budget thin. Wait until you find out you have to pay a decent chunk of change to park your car on Oak Park streets past 11pm 




 So, I'm going to recommend that you look at Elmwood Park or River Grove. I take it that your schedule doesn't allow you to use public transit. These towns are outside the city of Chicago, but if it is crucial that you are able to be in Maywood in 20 mins notice then you could be in Maywood in that time window. 

I'm not sure what your definition of "ghetto" is, so I'm steering you clear of the west side and Maywood. I grew up in Melrose Park and most people in the neighborhood talked about Maywood as if it were a lawless hellhole (although it is right next door and not too different than Melrose Park)

Elmwood Park/ River Grove are neighbors to the city, and if your planning to access the city by car it won't take too long. However, if you insist on living in the city of Chicago, then look at Jefferson Park or Old Irving Park. (With traffic do not assume that Maywood would be 20 mins away at any given time... or ever really)

 Hoping we take the time to get him acquainted with the North American game, even if it means spending a year in Rockford. Before Tony Salmelainen came to the Hawks he was absolutely scoring at will in Finland. However, he wasn't able to do much here. we have the depth now to take the time for a speedy Fin to get immersed in North American hockey.

 Look at the North or West areas of Alexandria. It's moderately expensive but Arlington in sky high. 




 When my fiancee and I lived in the DC metro we had a combined income of 90k and we still couldn't justify living in Arlington. We ended up on the West end of Alexandria for significantly cheaper. About 10 mins from Arlington and about 30 from Capitol Hill. 1 Bedroom apts. in Arlington are about $1700; it's pretty unjustifiable. I'm getting way more for my money in Chicago; however the job market in the DC metro area is great. 

I'd say focus on work first, get that promotion, and then live in Arlington. NoVA is pretty damn expensive.

 The length of the North American season   playoffs and travel factors do not make it feasible for NHL teams to be participants. However, it's not necessarily elitist to say that the North American teams would add a highly co mpetitive element to the league. Not to undermine European hockey, but it would be an awesome showcase to see vastly different styles of play go head to head. 




 Perhaps it is a step in the right direction, but the Model E is not going to be a "mass market" car like some are saying. It's projected to cost Tesla $48,000 to make one, so those figures of it being under $40,000 are not going to come to fruition. 

I remember before the Model S hit the showroom, there was a Tesla display at the mall. The guys from Tesla were showing off the Model S as a concept and saying "It will be available for under $50,000." We know how that turned out. 




 Are we considering the $40,000 concept vehicle a "mass market" vehicle. Sure, long term ownership will save many people a significant amount of money in fuel costs, but damn, that is a lot of money to fork over.

 It's really hard for me to hate Fleury; in fact, it was really hard to get excited about the Hawks in the early 2000s. Like the writer of the blog, I was watching the Wolves win Turner Cups and Calder Cups during this era, and learning that Fleury was coming to the Hawks was exciting. True, he didn't perform; he was out of shape and on a bad team, not to mention that he was suicidal during his stay in Chicago. When the team is only good enough to win 30 games in a season, guys like Fleury, Sullivan, and heck even Kyle Calder provided rare bright spots in a dreary season.

Funny enough, I actually found an autographed copy of his book "Playing with Fire" in a used bookstore last night. The chapter on Chicago gives a great perspective on his performance here. I was laughing in the bookstore after reading Brian Sutter's quote. "Theo, you're in fucking horrible shape."

 This is good news. At least a year in Rockford is probably necessary. I mentioned it before, but part of me worries that he has the potential to be Tony Salmelainen 2.0. Dominance in the European game doesn't always translate to the game across the pond. Really glad we have Richards for next year, and the depth to allow him to grow as a playmaker.

 Eh. I'm more familiar with the 2011 version of Roussel, not much of an intimidator. My observation from this year was he was trying to mix it up with at smaller Andrew Shaw (5'10"/180) any chance he had, while he avoided Bollig like the plague until Bollig finally grabbed a hold of him at the end of the season. 




 Belak and Probert both left this word far too prematurely as well.  




 Unless you consider his habit of fighting guys smaller than him, and losing most fights an "enforcer." Seriously, watched this guy with the Chicago Wolves (AHL) years ago; he lost every fight. 

However, [loved the fight with Shaw this winter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-SRugYRRV0); and I gained an inkling of respect for him for [his fight with Bollig](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4k_JEa8IGQ)

 That is the second most recognizable Previa in the world after Khan's car from *King of the Hill.* 









 There was a time when he was one of the only positive things going for the Hawks. There were literally 10,000 at a lot of the games. I'll never forget when Ol Sullivan got a hat trick on saint Patty's dy. 




 Enjoy a New Jersey dog topped with savory toxic waste, celebrating the heritage of the Garden State which is home to more than 100 toxic waste dumps.  




 It's on par with the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. Less gems, more dinosaurs. Go to the Oriental Institute at U of C if you are visiting again. Mummies + tons of ancient stuff from the Middle East. 




 First of all your idea of DC people being uptight workaholics is true. Now add politically charged to that. Thank God I'm back in Chicago where people distrust politicians enough to not wear their political views on their sleeves. 

As you probably know, DC is EXPENSIVE! Here you will never pay $4.35 for a damn train ride one way within the city. I'm not sure what neighborhood you live in, but the wife and I made more than $90k per year in DC and we had a mediocre 1BR apartment on the west end of Alexandria, VA for $1300/mo... and literally DIRT for a front lawn. Here, you will get a lot more for your money if you're a renter. No it isn't cheap (sales tax..ahhhh), but by DC standards it would be a breath of fresh air. 

Now here are my biased opinions:
 
-Chicago Art Institute  National Gallery of Art/ *any* Smithsonian Museum

-Museum of Science and Industry  Smithsonian Space whatever-the-hell-it's-called museum 

-Chicago lake front  National Mall

-Chicago hot dog  DC-3 (which has some damn good hot dogs)

-Deep dish pizza  $60 sushi roll or whatever people go out and eat in DC

-Mariano's   Jewel-Osco  Giant or Harris Teeter

-Chicago's grid system of roads  Than the 6 miles of traffic circles on Mass Ave that will take you 1.5 hours to drive down.

-Bears   Blackhawks  Racist Redskins or creatively named "Caps"

-Chinatown = Chinatown, but Chicago also has Korea town + Argyle Street (mini- SE Asia)... Get into Vietnamese subs!

-Wicker Park  H Street 

-Have to say I haven't experienced much of the Pride celebration here in Chicago (always avoided the huge crowds), but DC Pride was pretty huge, my guess is that it stacks up. 

In summary, you'll find what you're looking for here in Chicago. Move here if you can get a solid job lined up! 




 ["It's pretty amazing to see what this team has accomplished, but again there's no satisfaction here at all."](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyoyDZmAPAY). No satisfying this man until he wins another cup; Toews is *the* undisputed best captain in the NHL.  




 He should have made more pie charts!

 It seems like the giant open-ice hits that have generated so many injuries and suspensions in this past decade were a result of minimizing all of the clutching and grabbing that went uncalled in the past. At least my observation is that a majority of the *dirty hits* that we've come to know (mainly the ones involving a guy on a stretcher) are coming in a post 2005 NHL. 

Not to say that the 80s game wasn't full of dirty plays, just on a different level.  




 Instant. Classic. 




 DUNC! What a game!!! We're going right down to the wire.  




 Thanks for the analysis, Shaw.  









 Think you're right, but I do like the Morin suggestion; feel like he could be the sparkplug needed to get a quick goal or help set the climate for hard forechecking early on.  




 3 assists in the first 12 minutes. I would say he showed up; going to need Kane to keep razzling and dazzling for the next 170 minutes of the series.  




 Weighing in at 3500 lbs. and marketed as a "safe vehicle" (SV), I remember reading about it in "Automotive Atrocities" as a kid; also, just discovered that it is on *Time*'s  "50 Worst Cars of All Time"... but ya know, I can appreciate this lime green beast.   









 Have to go with the green alligator.

 This Special and Season 2 of Maron on Christmas Eve! Really hope ol' Freckleface can make an appearance on that show one day. Maron + Burr = Genius. 




 I do not like Nordstrom. Regin is more versatile, and there are other Rockford guys that could provide more of an offensive spark if needed. So what's the point of even calling him up? 




 Well, feeling better about the three goal lead, not sure why the trend is developing to back down with a two goal lead. (See game against Caps, See game against Flames) 




 Will Brandmeier be harassing random Wisconsinites on his podcast? Somehow, that doesn't seem quite as fun.  




 Listening on the WGN app (delayed)... Update: SHOWWWWWTIMMEEEEE! 




 How 'bout a little SHOWTIME in this shootout!?!? 




 Well, I thought that was funny. Have an upvote. 




 I really hope that Judd Sirott can get a shot in the play-by-play booth some day. The guy has so much enthusiasm, and does tons of homework before the game. I listened to him do play-by-play with the Wolves during that period of time that the Hawks were shit. He was electric with Brian Noonan. 




 Well, let's not pretend that Foley and Eddie O are the greatest.
 
Olczyk: "Here's a tip for all you young hockey players, see how Johnny Toews has his stick on the ice, you have a much higher percentage chance of scoring with your stick ON the ice." 

Foley: "And with that goal the Hawks should take some momentum into the TURD period."

Then... 30 seconds of silence 




 Racconto the worst? I've been eating that stuff for years; the Pagliacci brand isn't bad either. Pick some up at [Serelli's!]( http://serrellisfinerfoods.com/) We used to buy jars of that stuff every Christmas Eve, there's no way that cheap-ass Centrella brand is any better.

 I suggest that you do some research about the year 1968. It was a huge turning point which led to years of many Black Chicagoans distrusting law-enforcement (among other things), and many White Chicagoans feeling unsafe in predominately Black neighborhoods. At the time these feelings were justifiable, but they've persisted for decades.  




 You didn't hear? [Rob Zombie is not fun anymore.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW0KrpmfcTU)

 Do we really need to keep referring to Carcillo as an "enforcer?" Yes, Rosenbloom calls him an "agitator" in the article, and that is what Carcillo is. Yet I've seen a dozen articles since last weekend stating that the Hawks have brought back their "enforcer."

Is Carcillo really going to police play on the ice? If a John Scott-type boards one of our guys, what is he going to do about it other than make a bunch of noise and take an undisciplined penalty? 

From what I remember Carcillo's fights were usually retaliatory when he was here.

 Hello, career gurus.

I'll try to make this as to-the-point as possible, but I apologize in advance if this turns into the Unabomber Manifesto.

My wife (age 27) and I (age 26) both work for the same company, but at different sites. We are reading specialists who work in the clinical setting; that's about as descriptive as I'm getting about the private company we work for. We both have had previous management roles in the company, but upon relocating to Chicago (my hometown/where my wife has decided that she wants to stay forever) we have limited opportunities for growth within our company, and have since taken pay cuts.

I have a teaching degree, but my only endorsement is in Social Studies; it has been way less fruitful trying to land a classroom position here in Chicago than my search in DC. (I got one on my first interview there).
My wife does not have a teaching certificate, but is going to get her Masters' in Special Ed and her IL License. She'll get a job in 2 years, not doubting that. I'm considering doing a 9 month program to get my endorsement to teach Special Ed as well. (We both have a number of years working with this population in the clinical setting).

Here's how the proposed Grad School costs break down:
Wife's Masters' Degree: $35k
My Endorsement: Probably $12k

I feel like my wife is a bit of a spontaneous person and not a planner like myself. I can't really see these costs making life too much easier at the moment. Especially if we are multiplying our debts 4 or 5 times.
I hate to say this to her, but I'm starting to think that when we move out of our nice $1300/mo apartment on the Northside this December that we won't be able to live in a place this nice for the next decade. (We won't be getting rich as teachers, but the expected salary would probably be about $48k with increases; that's about 15-20% more than what we make now)

With this outlook, should I focus on how going back to school may maximize our earning potential, and provide more for our future (a pension plus a 403b plan, rather than the 401k that our employer matches 10%) or is will this make us highly-qualified, yet broke educators?

Any thoughts appreciated.

Thanks! 









 Hello! I wanted to gain some perspective on the value of an LBS1 endorsement as a job candidate. I have an IL Type 09 certificate with a grade 6-12 designation and a focus in social studies. (...yes, only social studies...)

Would doing a 9 month endorsement program for LBS1 increase my chances of getting a classroom job next fall? Or, is a position as a Special Ed teacher really dependent on Special Ed licensure?

I have 3 years experience with students with special needs in the clinical setting.

Thanks in advance, and keep up the amazing work and dedication!  




 Dear someguy, May smokin Jay spread the wealth, and may the Forte be with you.  




 CAN WE CUT THE LEASH ON FORTE, ALREADY? TIME TO DECIMATE THE CHEESEHEADS! 




 Cooks will see more looks while Floyd is left in the void.  




 the one about his vision of the apocalypse is hilarious, and needs to be made into a movie with "the barely recognizable Michael Richards" 









 Not to mention that you can get a slice of deep dish pizza the size of a dinner plate with no wait at all. (Which would otherwise be a 40 min experience at Giordano's) 




 Eh. I like the way things turned out. We can still kick ourselves for taking Skille over Kopitar in '05. There are few guarantees in the draft. After Ovi and Malkin, there is a huge drop-off in this draft class.  




 "Rex is our Quarterback." 




 Is it just me or is that Windsor looking a little off CENTAH? 




 Here's to hoping Harbaugh has an epic meltdown after this one! 




 Ha. When I lived in DC I'd drive down to Mt.Vernon, VA to buy Pastorelli's pizza sauce. "Imported" from the West Side of Chicago. 




 Marconi and Racconto are the only acceptable giardenerias. Well done. 




 Gotta love ol' Billy Red Face during hockey season. One month away, but I'll definitely be tuning in for this psycho. 




 In the spirit of Boston taking this title... [Here's one of the most hilarious anti-Blackhawks rants ever](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upZ4CTfA6pQ) Start around 1:30, just about died of laughter around 3 mins in. 




 Great tribute. We always have bets to see what round my Dad will draft Robbie Gould. He's grabbed him as early as the third. He restrained himself until the ninth  this year. 




 Pssh. I'd expect nothing less than Murray Craven. 




 As is Byfuglien! No hate for Daze, really unlucky with his back problems, however. 




 Was there for our first meet up, out of town Sunday but looking to get back out there soon. 




 Or if you're considering Championships in the last 30 years it goes: 

Hawks, Hawks, Sox, Bulls, Bulls, Bulls, Bulls, Bulls, Bulls, Bears. 




 My wife would probably get a job in a few weeks after graduating. She's great at networking and communicating with professionals. In fact, there is a few schools that have already inquired about hiring her in the short amount of time she has decided to leave the company, but she's been inhibited by the fact that she doesn't have a teaching license. 

I'd have to work harder for sure, but my track record is good and getting an endorsement in Special Ed should help my chances. It's just that the Chicago area teaching job market is completely flooded with people like me, so the endorsement would hopefully set me apart. Part of me wants to explore the job market in other places (like her home state of Florida) where prospects seem better.  




 Oh, I'll never miss DC or taking 90mins to drive 6 miles. 
























 Where did you find them? I can recall seeing a collection of tickets in the trash near Chicago and Austin a few years ago. 




 In all fairness, bronchitis can be a rather time consuming illness that a number of people simply don't have time to deal with. 




 Also, that's just a REAL heads up pass from Johnny Toews, out there, couple-a happy humans out there, Pat. 




  Jersey and underwear ONLY, then. No excuses! 




 Same here. Knox and Mike Brown's injuries were especially heartbreaking because those guys played with such emotion and intensity.  




 Well, [here's Johnny Knox's last time on an NFL field.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnGgBba0K_A) As unlucky a football injury as I've ever seen.

 I'm not sure Ms. Frizzle got enough permission slips to do this field trip.  




 I think that Yelp claims that businesses cannot pay to remove negative reviews. I did write a scathing review of Group Fox Properties a few months back, and it disappeared twice. I had to copy and paste it a few times to get it back up on the page. 




 Judging from the graphic on the back "Eurocar: moving your way" is probably the German version of U-Haul. The person driving it probably has zero experience driving trucks.  




 They were believed to be associated with gangs. 




 At the Lutheran school I went to my friend got sent home for wearing [this shirt depicting Homer in his underwear.](http://www.peaydesigns.com/images/Clothing%20-%20Tshirt%20-%20The%20Simpsons%20-%20Homer%20-%20Livin%20La%20Vida%20Sofa1.jpg) My science teacher said he wanted to send a strong message that we were not to wear clothing depicting images of people in underwear.

Then I went to a public high school were the following apparel/colors were banned: 
Baby Blue and Black, Yellow and Black, the color Pink, NY Yankees gear, Georgetown University gear, the number 22, and any random Mexican kids that security wanted to stop in the hallways. 

The punishment was going to the Dean's office and changing into these giant Pepsi t-shirts. I'm constantly baffled as to why neither school just made us get uniforms. 




 It's expensive. 




 Eager and Burish are still in town playing for the Wolves.  




 YES! Sullivan needs to be way higher on this list!

[Legendary moment with Sullivan:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qye101BNhWE) 
People seem to forget that he scored two short-handed goals after getting hit with the puck. 

Also, I remember him having an epic game on St. Patty's day one night. His trade to Nashville was so infuriating; scores a hat-trick in his first game as a Pred and puts up 10 pts in 3 games.

 Yeah, man. Who could forget that night that when Jordan had the flu, and he went out and got five points against the Avs, including the game winning assist on a Tony Amonte goal.  




 Ha! I loved how she was constantly flirting with Tim McGill, it was uncomfortably hilarious.  




 He should call [Carl](http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/fd/99/2c/fd992cb5c1ca0b652611fb776d076b61.jpg) to help him improve the van's image a bit. 




 That an extremely rare signature edition Cougar. Design experts from 3M and Reynolds Wrap were consulted, and just 8 of these were put into production. 




 The floral pattern here, is clearly too loud. The vest? That's aspirational. Now, many centuries of great men have taught us that blue shirts just make sense. It evokes a feeling dating back to the days of the indigo trade....  




 2 minute penalty to Sharpie for being too handsome. 




 Cory "Don't Toews me, bro" Schneider.  




 I've seen enough highlights of him writhing and flailing about since the Shaw incident. STAY ON YOUR FEET, MIKEY!

 THANKS FOR SUCKING THE LIFE OUT OF MY WEEKEND, NIEMI!
 




 This week, as in today? The picture of Barrett punching Pierzynski would make the visit worth my time.  




 He was right about that last storm. The fact that he says that "the temperature will turn brutal" after the storm is the most upsetting thing.

 [r/chicagopickupsoccer](http://www.reddit.com/r/chicagopickupsoccer/) was active over the summer, but has since gone into hibernation. We met up at Wrightwood Park for small-sided games. Your best bet is to message some of the guys in the original thread to see if they would want to restart the group. I'd be up for playing... in March. 




 There is a place on Montrose near Ashland called 20th century that specializes in this type of repair. If you happen to check it out let me know how it goes. It's a really curious place because I always see a guy that looks like Jerry Springer working into all hours of the night. The last time I walked by he was monkeying around with a VCR at 1am. 




 I took a picture of cab #666 like 2 years ago, and it was a Nissan Altima. Guess the reaper has fallen on hard times, that car is a downgrade. 




 Ha I saw that sign that said "2HR 18MIN to JANE BYRNE" on the Edens. That's when it's time to just roll the dice with city streets.  




 Me too. While on a smaller scale, I was just pissed that this happened right under my nose:

Recently, I ran into the Edgewater Jewel early one morning and had a guy remark to me how cold it was. (He's parked next to me, so I happen to notice that he has the same make and model car; only his looks crappier) I thought it unusual that he needed to walk around my car to get to his, but wasn't suspicious. As I come out of the Jewel, lo and behold, I had a few center caps that just happened to be missing.   




 Indeed. Ah, yes, ol' chap. Here's to a smashing ice hockey match. Cheers! 




 I refuse to upvote you until this comment has a plastic lawn-chair. 




 Yes! I got there slightly before 10, and was able to wait inside. Yes, they do dismiss all 3,000 people through 4 doors on State street; so the front entrance is a little squished. However, it is worth getting there early so you don't freeze your ass off. Hannibal Buress went on at about 10:35 and did an awesome opening set.
