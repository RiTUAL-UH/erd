 I have lived there a year and paid a lot of late fees because my job keeps witholding and fucking with my pay. I couldn't save at all because I was paying sometimes 40 a month extra in late fees because of my job. I have also recieved three 10 day eviction notices. The first was for being 10 days late, the second for seven, the third for 2. I had never missed a payment, only paid late. My landlord recently broke my car window and has done nothing toward paying for it. I only have until 10/15 left in the lease and last rent is due 9/15. The entire length of my tenancy the management company has been shady and rude and I don't believe I will see a dime of ny security despite making no damage. I am not worried about future tenancy as I will be living with my parents for some time from then on and can use them to get a new apartment down the road if need be. 

What will happen if I don't pay? 


































 I'm new here and don't know a whole lot. My girlfriend recently took up MK and I like a lot of the products, but are they actually good for skin? I like microdermabrasion and botanical effects. 




 What do you guys like and dislike? Our anniversary is coming up, and my girlfriend and I want some new toys. We have been looking at RodeoH for me and Velvetnest for her. Anyone know anything about them or any other preferences? 









 We have been together just shy of four years. She has PCOS and has yet to find a perfect birth control to treat it. The current one has her extremely nasty and she claims depressed but I don't know. 

Last night, I got stuck late at work and therefore late to pick her up. She knows I am working on getting a raise. She called my mother and they each called me several times trying to find me. The exact situation happened a week ago. I told her that she is mauling me and she got pissed at me for worrying her.

She will not get her driver's license, leaving me responsible for transportation of both of us.

My mom is disabled and doesn't socialize much except with me and my girlfriend. My girlfriend often ignores her in favor of reading books despite the fact that my mom has bent over backwards for her. (Buying work uniforms, letting her move in at 17, etc).

I wake up early in the morning for work and she works second shift. I spend free time with my mom as I only get one and her poor health means I need to treasure the time I get. She always complains about being tired and wanting to go home when she gets far more sleep than I. 

We used to be very sexual. We would have sex twice a day everyday the whole first summer we were dating. We haven't had sex in a month. I ask and get either maybe or we'll see or I'm tired. I hate being rejected. Mostly I hate when she spends the day trying to grope me and make out with me AT MY MOMS HOUSE and then sleeps when we get home.

We are going away in October for our 4th anniversary. I took a day and a half off work for it already. She has yet to request it. I don't even know if I want to go. We were going to announce our engagement after this trip. I don't know if I want to promise another week never mind the rest of my life.

She promised we wouldn't go to her abusive father's wedding. (He abused us both when we lived with him briefly.) Then she told them we would. Now we aren't because it's the weekend before our anniversary and she can't get two weekends in a row off. She still hasn't told him she isn't going to attend. 

I really do love this girl. We have been together since high school. I just don't know where to go from here.

TL;DR girlfriend is being unusually psycho and I don't want to stay but I don't want to leave either. 
























 Theu played hockey with the poor little guy amd cleaned him thoroughly. He was fine. Theu were ashamed. It was very adorable in the end after a horrifying beginning. 









 My Moxie, who is probably around 2, has had labored breathing and been barely moving since at least 8 this morning. She is hanging on and her cage mate Roxie keeps checking on her. I have accepted that she is likely dying, but is there something I can do to help her? 









 One who saves you personally. 














 On /r/parenting, people talk about cosleeping in a positive way. We know cosleeping is dangerous. Babies get rolled on, and babies roll or fall of beds. Having a baby in bed also destroys intimacy in the parents' relationship. It is hard to get a kid to stay out of your bed anyway. If you let them for a long time then stop them, it'll be thay much harder later, further destroying intimacy. Basinets are not a huge inconvenience. Keep it by your bed to make feeding easy. They are small enough that they fit nearly anywhere. There are also basinets that get attached to the bed. Cosleeping should always be discouraged and absolutely never encouraged. CMV. 














 On October 10th we will be together for four years. Their wedding is October 4th. 

They got married already and are now having a big wedding. They waited two months before accidentally telling my partner that they got married. 

They have out right stated that they dislike me and that our relationship is invalid. We aren't sure if it is because I am female or if it is personal.

It is a semi themed wedding. My partner is to dress for the theme while I am not.

Despite the fact that we have been together two years longer than them, our invitation was addressed to my partner and guest. They know my name.

Are we being petty or is this just icing on the rude cake that is her parents?

**tl;dr**: Father in laws. Girlfriend wouldn't exist without him, and he won't go away.  
























 You guys are really turned on by WBC. 









 I am overweight, hefty, whatever you prefer. I got an exercise trampoline to help change that. After having been swimming a lot lately and generally eating better, I decided to jump on it today, not for the first time. I jumped twice and metal flew from the side and scared the hell out of my cats. 

TL DR too fat to work out, not fat enough to be confined to a bed.

Edit: Thank you all so much for being encouraging! I start my next semester of college on August 25th and since we have a new campus, I get access to a great gym facility that I plan to use. I'm going to keep at it and maybe be able to show you guys some before and after in a few months.  



















 Half a case of Lager in my fridge and I can't stand the taste. 














 Ask whatever. 




 I work for an agency to transport a developmentally delayed man to and from work and to take him to activities. Currently, my car is unsafe due to the lack of these parts. My brother and father are willing to install the parts, I just can't afford them right now. I am on food stamps and extremely hard up. If you can find the parts for the car (1999 Plymouth Neon) cheaper and wish to send me those, feel free. Anything at all helps. PM for shipping info if interested.

 It is up to mod discretion and I have been deleted in AskWomen because the mod fucking DISAGREED with me. I'm sorry but if you can't handle reading words on the internet you need to be in a bubble. It is total bullshit that people are so offended by words that they are deleted. It just gives the words more power. Grow the fuck up. And un fucking subscribe to AskWomen and their asshole mods. 



















 A few bad apples can spoil the whole bunch. The reason for not wanting them to be there in the first place is people who choose to expose their non female genitals in what is supposed to be a female space. Take Mich Fest for example. Many women there are victims of violent sexual assault. They are choosing to be in a space they feel is safer. As a women only space they should not have to worry about seeing male genitals. Pre op stealth women would not want to be outed and so would be extremely unlikely to even accidentally expose themselves. Post op transwomen have no.male genitals to show. In order to keep people more comfortable, a female space should be just that. People who are male do not belong their if they risk hurting female women even emotionally. 

Disclaimer: I am not debating whether or not trans women are women. They without a doubt are regardless of stage of transition. The issue is whether or not out transwomen who are pre op or non op belong in a space meant for females to feel safe. 

TL DR a penis free zone is a penis free zone. Cmv. 









 I am a transmasculine genderqueer lesbian. I am 19 and live in an apartment in the Poconos with my girlfriend of almost 4 years and our 11 pets. What would you guys be interested to see in a youtube vlogging channel from me? If you post specific questions, I will answer them in the video. 














 Hosted my brother's graduation party last night. My uncle in his 60s buys a case of lager to split between him, my other uncle, and my cousin. They only get through half so he leaves instructing my older brother to inform me that it's mine and to put it in the fridge. I don't like beer from my limited Rolling Rock experience and I don't have friends to drink with. 




 There is a reason you aren't legally allowed in Central Park after dark. If you choose to go in anyway and are raped/mugged/attacked/murdered, you knew the risk of going into the Park.

We all know that date rapes happen. If you leave your drink completely unattended and then choose to drink from it again, you are partially responsible as you are the one who chose to put something rather unknown into your body.

Bullies currently heavily target out gay kids. If you "pass" for straight and choose to be out in school, in part, you brought on the harassment. You knew the risks.

I know that breaking the law doesn't give others a right to harm you nor does making any other potentially poor choice, but if you know the risks and follow through anyway, you aren't totally innocent. 

TL;DR: choices have consequences. CMV. 





























 Has anyone done this before? I've never even been to the city. Any advice you could offer would be great. 









 I have been with my girlfriend and out as a lesbian for almost four years. A friend of ours invited us (well actually she told us we were going not asked) to a picnic with her family this weekend. We were happy to go until she informed me and my girlfriend we can "be out just don't hug or kiss or touch and don't act like you are dating". She askef my gf if she is okay wiyh it and my gf is a bit of pushover and was like oh yeah sure. However I am pissed. I went through a shit ton of crap for the right to be out. Like I had food thrown at me and was slammed into lockers and walls and just about pushed down the damn stairs. This girl knows all of this and yet she had basically told me to hide it. I cannot believe it. I have been nothing but supportive of her (she is a lesbian) and my girlfriend and I know how to behave. But for us to not be allowed to hold hands or anything is insulting. Now we are stuck going to this picnic and I don't know what to do. Am I overreacting? Should I still go?

TL DR: been out for 4 years. Friend wants my gf and me to hide us being a couple and gay for a picnic. Advice? 




 I work split shift for between five and eight hours Tuesday through Friday and tutor a kid when it fits with my work schedule. My partner works around 15 hours a week at a restaurant on weekends with extra shifts sprinkled in. Since the semester is over, we have a lot more free time. I desire to get things done. We need to be finding ways to make more money so we can get out of our really shitty financial situation (a near eviction, no car insurance, power over 1000 dollars late and due to be shut off, no food, etc.). I work from 8 to 830 every morning. She usually comes with me. Lately, she has been either staying in bed, or, like right now, going back to bed. She went to bed at about 1 this morning so it isn't like she should be exhausted. She knows I don't want to mess up my extremely sensitive sleep schedule. She insists I lay in bed next to her until she gets up at some point between 10 and 11. She gets mad at me if I go to the bathroom. I really love her and want to marry this girl. I just hate spending my days in bed not even asleep. I either read or go on reddit and facebook all morning.

TL;DR: Life ain't nothin but sleeping girls and no money. 

















































 In Cultural Anthropology just now, I was reading the AskReddit thread about kids' lies. I laughed, audibly, at one of the stories. Incidentally, I laughed just after my teacher was talking about slaves. Now my class thinks I find slavery funny. 







































 Can provide a spare bed in my living room. Lesbian couple, ages 19 and 20, pm me if needed. 




 There is a person in one of my classes that is a transwoman, however, at least in that class, she is not out. I know she is trans in part because of her presentation and in part because I was told such by a mutual friend when I asked. I only asked because she is very feminine and is referred to by other classmates with male pronouns. We have only interacted once and I avoided pronouns. What should I use? 




 If it pertains, I live in Monroe county.

My girlfriend and I have lived in our apartment for 5 months as of March 15th. In that time, we have been late with payment because of waiting on paychecks but have always paid the 5 dollars per day charge. 

I work as a companion to a man with Down Syndrome. He had been in the hospital, so I couldn't get papers signed, so I couldn't get paid. My pay will be in on April 5th. I will be getting about 700 dollars. Our rent is 675. I made a partial payment the day after the rent was due this month of 150 dollars. My girlfriend lost her job and got a new one and had been waiting on new pay checks to come. Today, March 25, we came home to a 10 day eviction notice. Our lease does state that habitual late payment can result in eviction. When we made the partial payment at the real estate agency the lease is through, we explained the scenario and asked to be notofoed if there would be an issue. No one notified us until now. Any and all advice is of help. 




 Edit: My girlfriend and I started datibg at fifteen and sixteen. Now that we are 19 and 20, seeing one is important. We both liked her's so I have an appointment with him next month. Just wondering if this was common. 




 Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, but you girls always answer stuff well.

Back ground on us: I am 19, she will be 20 in early April. We have been together 3.5 years. 

Background on Dad: He has been married to 4 different women. He married my girlfriend's mom, divorced her after about two years, ran away to Vegas to marry wife number 2, then had a big Catholic wedding a year later. Divorced wife 2, married wife 3. Married wife number 2 AGAIN in a secret wedding, and is now having another big wedding to her.

Background on my girlfriend and her dad's relationship: he left when she was 2. He saw her maybe once a year until she was 16. Then, like 2 or 3 times a year. She and I lived with him for 7 months until he threw us out to move in with wife #2 in her state, 2 hours away. He has since tried to force her to leave me and move im with him and force them to only spend time together despite her refusal since he is verbally abusive and controlling. 

He hates me. We are both expected to attend this wedding, and the wife wants my girlfriend to be a bridesmaid, despite only having seen her 4 times since she was 4. My girlfriend doesn't want to go. I really don't want to go. Do you guys think we are obligated? 
























 As a gq lesbian, I don't quite get it as it is. How does it work in general and is it different for transgirls? 




 I know this is pretty insignificant, but today I was on /r/AdviceAnimals and I eealized something really shitty. Every Scum Bag Steve post was ahout general douchey stuff. Every Good Guy Greg post is about general nice thing. However, every Scum Bag Stacy post is about either a girl being a "slut" or a bad mom, and every Good Girl Gina meme seems to be about her sleeping with the guy or being a good homemaker. Does anyone else see this? 














 I am FAAB genderqueer leaning male. For as long as I can remember, I have "felt" a penis, just been unable to see it. I'm just trying to figure stuff out. 





































































 Generally, guys aren't all that clean. And lack of sensitivity is a good thing because you last longer. And, while minimal, it does protect against some STIs.

Edit: thank you all for realizing I was serious and not trolling. Much more to think about for when I eventually have children.  





























 NSFW 









 What were some of your rules, who suggested it, would you do it again? 









 I'm FAAB. I have identified as genderqueer leaning male for almost 5 years now. 

From when I was a kid, I have distinct what I call "trans memories". For one thing, I remember trying to make an STP out of a toilet paper roll. I also remember trying to always have a reason to use the men's room. When I first saw the SVU Episode "Transitions", I cried because I thought that my parents had gotten me a sex change when I was a baby and wondering why they couldn't just love me as the baby boy I assumed I had been born as. 

I'm fairly certain that I am FtM. My family would not accept it. We've already discussed it. My girlfriend says that she would be very much okay with, but I don't think she would be okay with any bodily changes.

I'm wondering if, if I use Androgel, I can gain all of the effects besides facial hair. My family history is very limited body hair growth. My mom's brother's didn't grow facial hair until their thirties and it was then still very limited. My legs only need shaving once a month or less, as it grows so sparingly. Also, how much would my voice change most likely? 




 Added discussion, defend your choices, argue other people's. 




 Feel free to provide screen caps and such for examples. Also, do you frequen it and if so why? 









 Card games like Apples to Apples and Cards Against Humanity count, as do games like Kerplunk, Hedbanz, etc. 














 When I last left you guys, all was going rather swell. Sadly, since then, everything as fallen apart. Moxie, one of the girls, ate through most of the cardboard I used to make the split. I tried, since it had been a while with no fighting, to introduce them directly, and fighting immediately ensued. I haven't had the time since to work on making them a better divider, but once I do get some time, I'll be sure to let you all know. 









 So, I posted yesterday about introducing my kids with a homemade split cage. They initially fought (or tried) through the screen, but have since gone to seeming to almost ignore eachother. I am switching their sides periodically so they learn the scents, but I want to wait until they are sleeping side by side for a week before I put them all the way together since my boy is so young.  




 I want to breed some gerbils. I love mine, but I know that they will eventually die, so I want a little piece of them left. Also, some friends have said that they want gerbils, and would be good gerbil parents. I have homes lined up, and I am willing to keep any that don't get homed. 

I recently got a baby gerbil, I think about 1-2 months old. He is a little boy, he is solid very dark grey. I also have a pair of girls. One is blonde and and the other is grey and white. They are each in half of a split cage I made.

I used heavy cardboard wrapping paper tubes and window screen materials to make a divider. They can't seem to get through it. 

Wish me luck on this bonding! 














 [I was 17 and drunk for the first time when this happened. My girlfriend's father kept filling my cup with more cider, and I had never even had a sip before this. His girlfriend's six year old beat the living hell out of me.](/spoiler) 




 Also, did you ever get caught? What happened? 









 I am "blessed" with a 40HH chest. I have checked websites like Double Diva's and Casique, but no one seems to carry a bra in my size, particularly one with padding. I prefer padded bras as they hide my nipples more so. If anyone has a website that carries that size and they know it to be reliable, please let me know. 




 I have two female gerbils named Moxie and Roxie that I've had for about 9 months. I also have a little guy named Remy. I've had him for about a month. So far, he has bit me to the point of leaving a scar once, he has made Roxie bleed, and he has bit me hard a second time. They live in separate cages, but I want to breed them, so in a completely open cage without bedding, I was introducing him to Roxie. He doesn't seem to fight with Moxie as much. I got them from separate pet stores, no chance of relation.

I have tried placing their cages side by side, since Moxie is an escape artist, I don't want to risk her getting into his half if I were to split cage them. I have bought Remy special presents, including his own ball, a track to run it on, special treats, and various types of chew toys. He is still very shy and very nasty. 

How can I get him to be nicer?
 




 First ever post on reddit. 

When I was about 3 or 4, (I don't remember the first time) a neighbor kid of mine who was two years older, used to coerce me into doing inappropriate things with him. These started out just as him getting me to kiss him, and then lead to French-kissing, and further to eventually kissing and licking his genitals. He would tell me that if I told he would never talk to me again, and we were best friends. He also would say that if I didn't do what he wanted, he would tell his mom I started it or that I wasn't allowed in his rec room anymore. He had a captains bed, and, in my strongest memory, we were "hiding" in the part that goes near the wall while my brother played Nintendo 64 in the rest of the room.

I have always been aware of what happened to me as a kid. It was just the other day though that someone actually told me that it was abuse. I always pretty much just thought that it was just "kids being kids" or that I was willing. 

I must have been pretty young when it started, because I remember, very vaguely, my dad telling me that if anyone touched me or made me touch them, to tell him. I can remember at that moment wondering if the other kid counted, but I knew the other kid said not to tell.

Later in my life, when I was 13, there was a girl who I had been friends with for my entire life. She was 12. We knew we weren't supposed to, but we put on a DVD, I think it was American Pie, and she decided that we should try "stuff". The next day, for her birthday party, she told me that she told her other friend about all of it, and that her friend then wanted to join because they had done it before. I was pretty much terrified from the previous night, and I certainly didn't want her friend to know, never mind join. However, a few months later, I willingly fooled around with her, (the girl, not her friend), so I don't know if this can really count for anything, since I went back for more. 

I also recently realized that I have a large majority of "symptoms" per se of abused people. I have severe depression, despite the fact that I have a pretty good life. I am incredibly anxious all the time. I have been to the point of suicide more than once. 

What I want to know is, now that I am 18, can I get therapy without insurance? I live in PA. Also, does the second thing count for anything other than stupidity?  





























 It's just so disheartening that they don't understand what donation is and what it's like to not be able to have a kid with the person you love. Forget their lack of respect for their SO's bodily autonomy. 









 About me: I'm 20F and married to a woman. I identify as nonbinary but my mom said I can "get a sex change ten years after" she's dead. My wife is also 20. We've been together nearly five years.

A bit of back story; I had this job working with a guy with Down syndrome. I loved it. I love him. The agency doesn't pay regularly and every two weeks, when my pay was due, I was crying because they somehow fucked me over. This caused me to lose my apartment. I have since quit the job. During my last week, the last week of January, the master cylinder in my car went so I have no brakes. I used my dad's truck for work, and emailed my professors that I couldn't be on campus. I have not gone to class in two weeks and am at risk for being dropped from 18 credits and losing my financial aid.

Last night, he comes home from work and starts yelling at me that the truck is damaged and I drove it last. We live in a college town and have several houses on our street that have college kids. One had a party Friday night. Apparently someone drunk ripped off his mirror. I said I had nothing to do with it, which I didn't, and he starts yelling that I wasted a ton of gas and abused my use of the truck. When I told him that I hadn't used it except to go a mile each night but that on Friday I had a ton to do to get my car fixed, and that I was at risk for failing out of school, he yelled at me that it wasn't his fault and that if I didn't run my car into the ground this wouldn't have happened. 

I told him the master cylinder went on a 10 year old car and there was nothing I could have done. I went  upstairs to grab my stuff to leave and he yelled "don't forget to slam your door" in the douchiest tone possible. 

As I went down the stairs, I said "I'm depressed and can't afford counseling and nobody in this house cares!" And then I left. I called my best friend crying and he came to hang out with me in a local Rite Aid. We tried to drive my car but the brakes are completely gone so my dad told me to take his truck, no reference to previous conversation. My mom hasn't mentioned it either. 

She had known that I was seeing a counselor at my college for about three months and knew it ended with the last semester. She hasn't mentioned except, when I told her I was going, to say that I was "stronger than that". She has known for five years that I have panic attacks but says that's I'm over dramatic. 

How it's a good thing: I have been not going to the hospital for help because I didn't want to disapoint anyone. They don't care. I'm free to go. 

TL;DR: life sucks, then what? 









 I am knitting this for my friend and my idea is that when her little girl outgrows it, it can be her first pillowcase. Is this safe? 


































 If I have a disagreement with my parents about anything, my wife takes their side. She claims she hates confrontation and is trying to avoid a fight but she just makes me livid. 

Today, for instance, my sick and physically disabled mother was struggling to breathe. When asked if she needed to go to the hospital, she made up an excuse about insurance and not wanting to go. My wife said wait until Monday and then if she isn't better she will go. I have class all day on Monday. My mom said wait until Tuesday. My wife agreed with her. 

Tl;dr: MY MOTHER CAN'T BREATHE AND MY WIFE AGREED TO PUT OFF A HOSPITAL VISIT. 









 I have a 1997 850 and the other day the brake light came on. The manual said it needed fluid, and, when I went to go buy fluid, I had no breaks. My brother put some of his in it and we pumped the breaks and it kept seeming to drain but it isn't spraying or leaking anywhere we can see. Anyone know what's wrong and if it's an easy fix? 




 I think I want T in the future, but I know I want to give birth and breastfeed. If I go on T before that, how likely am I to become infertile? Will I be able to breastfeed? I want to do gel if that matters because I want as much control as possible over results. 




 I have some really severe suicidal ideation, including a preferred method if I were to do so. However, I don't intend to. My understanding is that ER staff do not discriminate between suicidal ideation and suicidal intent. Is this accurate? Do I need to distinguish which I am experiencing?

My mom is physically disabled and rather sick. Since I am self admitting, can I leave if there is an emergency with my family? If so do I need to make this concern clear ahead of time?

I know that, at my hospital, if you have a baby or are sick, your spouse can stay with you overnight once in a while. Is this possible for this situation?

How much say over visitors do I get? My mom can't go and my dad won't so I would really rather be able to just say I don't want them there, but I do want my wife to be able to see me. Is this possible? 

Since I am planning ahead, am I not sick enough or is it not an emergency enough that I should go?

What I need is medication. If possible, I'd like to get a prescription and get out of there. I don't have health insurance or free clinics near me and I'm broke. I'd rather not get even more behind in school if I can avoid it. Can that happen?

Does my college have to be accommodating to this? I'm a first semester sophomore at a community college and I'm taking 18 credits, 3 of them writing intensive. Do they have to be lenient with me or can they fail me over it? Last semester I saw a counselor at my school and we were supposed to work on finding me real help but my insurance fell through. She diagnosed me with depression and anxiety but it's not on paper anywhere. She seemed scared and insistant that I get help ASAP but I really couldn't. Is that relevant or helpful to me?

When I get nervous, I smile, laugh, and joke. In high school when I tried to get help at the safe room, they didn't belive me because of it. I really can't control it. Will the hospital do the same thing?

Is there anything I'm not thinking of that may be important?

Edit: I'm 20 but married. Will I be with kids or adults or adolescents? I live in Pennsylvania for reference. 









 I've poked around and even posted here a bit before, but here goes, I suppose.

I'm Trish/Patric. I'm genderqueer transmasculine. I'm not picky about pronouns at all. Use whatever you like.  My wife and my best friend, who is a transguy, are the only people I'm out to really at the moment. I don't intend to be out to my immediate family. Top surgery is a definite and T is a maybe, bottom surgery is a no go for me. Feel free to ask me whatever you'd like to know. 




 I have diagnosed clinical depression and anxiety and have for almost a decade. For me, that means insomnia and not caring about myself at all. Typically, an adult can bounce back and at least bother to do the bare minimum. I was 11 or 12, though, and not caring developed into terrible habits, that, at 20, I'm still struggling to kick. 

When I joined reddit a bit over a year ago, and came across SCA, I subscribed because I've always been lucky to have great skin, so I figured I might enjoy learning to actually wash my face. It took another nine months or so before I actually used it, but hey, I did eventually. 

Since then, I've started to remember to brush my teeth regularly. I know, gross, but being young and depressed is making bad choices. I've also started to drink water almost exclusively. I'm chubby, by like a lot, and have always been the kind of kid to cut gym class and hang out somewhere else, even if somewhere else is a bathroom. I've started using my college fitness center by choice. 

SCA has really helped me make some positive changes in my life, and I thank all of you for that. 




 My college has a free fitness center available to students. I'm finally taking advantage of it. I'm heavy. Depression will do that to you, as I'm sure a lot of you know. I don't care about losing weight right now. I'm just happy to be able to take the steps without getting winded. Today was day three of roughly 20 minute workouts and already I feel better physically. It doesn't seem to help my depression like people claim it will, but physically its not bad and I even find myself enjoying after years of cutting gym in high school. It's something at least. 









 Married: 1 month, 10 days.

Number of times we've had sex: 17.

Highlights: 10 were in the first week of being married. 

On our wedding night, you fell asleep with my nipple in your mouth, throwing me into a panic attack. I still count that time. 

You've gone down on me once, and you weren't happy about it. 

I love you but dammit baby you're supposed to want to have sex with your new wife. If we did the penny jar first year thing, we couldn't buy a McChicken at the end of the year.


Edit: thank you guys for being so supportive. I was in a bad spot last night when I posted this. I have diagnosed depression and anxiety and one of my symptoms when I get seriously upset is that I can't sleep, which manifested into this. My wife and I (yes, we're lesbians for those of you who expressed confusion) communicate endlessly. She has a lower sex drive than me and I need to get over it. Last night I was upset because, I after I went down on her and then got her off a second time, she had no interest in either going down on me or otherwise doing what I like. We have discussed it multiple times and I need to learn to accept it. Prior to getting married we averaged 3 to 4 times every week. Our wedding week ramped it up and I'm just hating the slow down. She has PCOS so hormone stuff is totally wacky meaning her libido is, too, but it sucks to be 20 and have her have a low sex drive. 




 I have what my best friend, who's a transguy, and I call "trans memories" which are memories from childhood that, if it happened now, you would know that you were trans*. For me, these include being seven and trying to use a toilet paper roll as an STP; being 10 and seeing the "Transitions" episode of Law and Order: SVU and crying because I thought my parents must have had me surgically made into a girl when I was born. Also during my childhood, I had plenty of experience being reminded that my mom knew when she found out she was pregnant with me that I would be a healthy girl because God didn't give her 16 years of not being able to get pregnant to give her another boy (I have two older adopted brothers and my parents fostered over 40 boys in the mid 80s). Whenever I wear my binder, which I have been a lot lately thanks to you guys giving me advice on it, she makes comments about how I look deformed and says that I must be binding in the most disgusted voice. I'm out to her as a butch lesbian, but when I came out she told me I had to wait until 10 years after she was dead if I was going to become a guy. She accepts other transpeople she just doesn't want it for me. It's hard. I'm just starting to feel better in my skin and she makes fun of me... I can't be out to her. It would kill her. She's physically disabled with a whole list of medical problems. It just sucks. 




 I work 17.5 hours every week, I have 18 credit hours this semester, I take care of my disabled mom and I need to do well this semester to graduate on time. I transport my wife to and from her job, too. My dad expects me to do everything. Today he told me brother (who does nothing. I repeat, nothing at all. He plays video games and sponges off of my family and his girlfriend. He's almost 19.) To tell me I had to get the balance of his debit card. They are both more than capable and I already do so much else and I didn't want to so I refused. He started harassing me about how I eat off the money so I can do it. He gets my food almost never. 

My wife and I both work. If we don't have enough after bills, my mom will get us food. I left. I wanted a cigarette so fucking bad but I'm trying not to smoke this year. Also, I don't have any money to buy a pack with. I want to die so bad. It's always little bullshit like this, but it adds up. It sounds so fucking stupid that this makes me feel this way. 

I'm quitting my job in 2 weeks because they often don't bother to pay me and I have to wait forever for my money. That's why my wife and I live with my parents. I feel like a goddamn failure. I'm 20, married, doing well enough for me in school (I have a 3.08) and I love my job but they don't pay me so I have to live at home. It fucking sucks. I know I won't kill myself. I have too much responsibility to kill myself. One day it will get better. But right now it fucking sucks. 


My school councilor diagnosed me with depression and anxiety but she can't really do anything to help. I don't have money for a doctor or insurance so I'm just fucking stuck. I can't check out of life for a week to get help because of all the fucking responsibility. I'm sorry for the wall of text. I just sort of needed to vent and all.

Edit: You guys are so great. I don't have a response right now for each of you, but know that you help me greatly. I ended up hanging out with a friend tonight and walking around the mall locally. I don't know if I'll go to the hospital any time soon, honestly. My wife won't have a way to get to and from school without me. That's not fair to her. Honestly, I'm scared. We haven't slept apart for more than one night since I was like 16. I don't want to be without her for that long.  




 I have a full torso binder, but it rolls too much so I'm trying to fold it up and over like some dudes suggested the other day. It's great for my chest, but I feel like I look pregnantish. Did anyone else feel this way at first? When did that feeling go away? I am trying to lose weight, but I'm pre or non T (not sure yet) so my body fat is very female distrusted. 



















 Where did you find binding/packing materials and the like? How did you get information about therapists and HRT? It's tough enough now with the Internet to help, but I can't figure out how it was done before then. 




 I have and Underworks 997 binder and a very large chest. While it does a pretty good job of flattening me, it will roll up on occasion, and it's very difficult to get it back down without my wife's help. Has anyone else had this problem? How can I keep this from happening?  
























 My job requires paperwork to be done at home, on my time. It takes three times as long to do it by hand as by computer, so I computerized all of it and have no access to the means to do it by hand. I have the forms that must be filled already partially and incorrectly filled in Excel, but no access to fix it. My job has already withheld my pay for 3 weeks and it will likely be 3 more or even longer before I see my money. I cannot afford to pay for the one month subscription. If anyone is willing to let me use their login just temporarily, I would really appreciate it. 







































 I don't care about the discrimination I face. I don't care that teachers bullied me in high school. I care that my mom and so many other people say that if I had the choice I'd have chosen to be straight. I wouldn't. I love everything about being gay. I love gay culture, I love having a cause, I love my wife, I love going to pride. I love being gay. Why is that such a bad thing? That really gets me down... 




 The character, who's name escapes me, dies in Phoenix with his boyfriend and I think his mother. The hospital disposes of his body wrapped in a garbage bag with other garbage. His boyfriend pays a funeral establishment to have him cremated despite the hospital's refusal to issue a death certificate. I have tried to Google this, but I can't come up with anything definitively confirming or denying it. 




 My job doesn't pay me when or what or how they're supposed to and it's really contributed to my mounting depression and anxiety. 

In high school, I started the Gay Straight Alliance for my school. Today I found out that my successor's successor, whom I selected for the role, got into her dream school with a full merit scholarship strongly because of her role as President of the GSA. She Facebook messaged me and thanked me for giving her the opportunity to reach this goal. 

It helped me to realize that I have a positive impact on people's lives and gave me the boost I needed to send this email. I don't even know if the place is hiring, but I tried, and for that I'm proud of myself. 

Today was a good day, Reddit. 




 I'm pretty upset for good reason and sitting in a McDonald's typing this, so sorry if it's all jumbled and fucked up.

We recently moved back in with my parents because my job doesn't like to pay me correctly and we couldn't keep up with our rent. My 18 year old brother is prince of the mother fucking earth. He does whatever the fuck he wants, including, tonight, when he came in the bathroom while I was showering and turned on the sink water and started flipping out and calling me names because I let his stupid ass dog in his room so it wouldn't shit on my goddamn flood. Big surprise, the fucking puppy shit on the floor. He should have taken the fucking dog out or put it in it's crate if he wasn't going to be able to take it out. I told him to turn the water off because the family dog had just puked all over me and I was trying to get cleaned off. He wouldn't. I told him to get the fuck out of the bathroom. He said "Or what, you'll sit on me?" 

I ran to my room and got dressed. I went downstairs and told my parents that SOMETHING needs to be done about their goddamn hellion. My dad said "I hate to say it, but I think it's time you find a place to live." My wife and I left and came to this McDonald's. I don't know what the fuck to do from here. We have no money, about 200$ in food stamps and a quarter of a tank of gas. I have to work tomorrow and I know they won't fucking pay me anyway. We just finished the last day of our semester of college, so switching to dorming isn't possible right now. I don't know what to do. 

If you're just commenting to tell me I'm awful, please, save it.

**tl;dr**: My brother's the best and I think I'm homeless. 














 Faux Thanksgiving was the Tuesday after the normal holiday; all of the talk was about her 18 year old, single, uneducated, unemployed, knocked up sister. That's fine. It was all super positive and everyone (except those of us with brains) is excited for her. My wife's aunt and uncle were there. They didn't say hello to me and only spoke to me to show me a picture of their dog. They also walked past me to say goodbye to others and didn't acknowledge me again. Then, we found out, her mother and said knocked up sister started shit talking us as soon as we left. 

Her mother originally did not intend to come to our wedding. After she was called out on it, she decided she would show up. Knocked up sister had an appointment and didn't show up. Mother made fun of our venue, made fun of my wife's outfit and feet, and complained that it was too small of a wedding. She left as soon as possible, no congratulations were offered and she texted later asking for her Crock Pot back since she forgot it. She owes my wife 15 dollars for a Mary Kay item and we haven't seen the money despite asking several times and really needing the money, and I felt it was ballsy to ask for it back when she owes us.

Last night was the family Christmas party. The only people who said hello to me were my MIL's ex roomate who felt awkward that everyone was ignoring me and my wife's other aunt. The pregnant sister tried to push me down some stairs and everyone else pretty much just ignored me. My wife was said hello to, I was just ignored.

My wife also has 3 younger sisters; they're 15, 15, and 13. I went all out on gifts for them. They're great kids and we get along great. I do not feel at all motivated or obligated to get gifts for the mother or other sister for Christmas. I need my money more. I am sick of going to things like this to be treated like shit. I hate it.

 :D 









 I'm a lesbian and a United Methodist. If this sub isn't really a gay friendly one, can anyone direct me to one that is? I'm working on trying to get over my depression, and seeing homophobic posts won't help. 









 I hope this is okay here; just subscribed today and this is my first post here. Sorry if it's not okay.


I unsubscribed from a lot of the defaults with the whole "bro culture" thing going on and am hoping it will help, since I let the comments and what not affect me too much. If it doesn't help, I'm probably going to leave reddit for a while, or at least delete the app from my phone, because for the last year, my depression has gotten worse and the main change has been my use of reddit that has gone up drastically, especially over the last several months. I dunno. I guess I'm just trying.  




 Are any littles... nonhuman? My little's "character" is a baby bear (age 5 and a half) named Meribell. Is name changing typical too? I also have a "character" that's a little who is a baby horse (age 4 and a half) named Ponyo. Is that at all common? Her "real" self is the big to my little and vice versus. Sometimes the littles play together and get into mischief. Does that happen for anyone else? It's also 100% non sexual. We're actually both turned off by the idea of including littles in sexual stuff. Is that at all common? I read the FAQ but I guess I'm a little confused about if we qualify? 









 She is 20, almost 21, and we have been together for over four years. She is likes to talk about fairies and princesses and has this intense love for all things "cute and chubby" as she puts it, meaning adorably pudgy dogs and bunnies and the like. She loves to tell bedtime stories before we go to sleep, which usually either center around fairies, princesses, or horses. She is obsessed with horses, but without a real desire to own one.

It's the cutest thing in the world. I can't wait for us to get married in a little over a week. I hope she never grows up. 














 /r/BoiFashionAdvice/

/r/MaleFashionAdvice tends not to help us out much, though their style is great, and /r/LesbianFashionAdvice is dead and focuses primarily on femmes. I created something for those of us who are bois, and fall somewhere south of masculine but not quite feminine either. 









 Edit: I didn't mean medical services sucked, I meant administration. Also, why doesn't the ACA help with this? Or has it just not yet? I get that vets shouldn't have to, but with the demand they may benefit from going outside the VA. I just feel like there is a lot I don't get. 



















 Bought a pack about a month ago. Wondering what they'll be like and for how long.  









 I personally like to fall asleep to audio books. I don't like to pay for them just to fall asleep. They're free on YouTube. 









 My girlfriend and I had been getting pretty heavy before she left for work. We had agreed that, when she got home, sexy times were to be had. Since we are currently living with my parents, they have to be sort of planned. 

Being a good girlfriend, I decided to wash our collection while I was in the shower, and left them out to dry on her towel, with it folded over. The family dog comes in, and, being the good dog that she is, starts snuggling me. When my girlfriend got home, I had shown her that I washed everything, so the towel was folded up, and everything was exposed.

Now I'm sure plenty of you are thinking that my dog grabbed one and brought it to my mom. That, happily, is not what happened. My brother came in my room to see if I wanted him to get the dog. After he left, I glanced over at the dog, and, between her and I, was a towel covered in sex toys. My brother just left and I'm hoping he decides to avoid talking to me until he forgets about this.

TL;DR I washed my sex toys then put them on display for my brother. 




 My soon-to-be-wife and I will be most likely attending Smith in about a year. We want to start a queer girl Four Seasons cover band. Anyone with knowledge or interest, feel free to comment! 




 Ask anything you wanna know, even if it's offensive. I will answer anything. 
























 I am a full time student. I am extremely intelligent, as awkward as it is for me to proclaim that. My GPA is falling fast.

I am the only daughter and despite the fact that my father is still married to and lives with my mom, I am the one primarily if not soley responsible for her care now that she is disabled. No one else will do anything for her but me.

I work as a companion to a man with Down Syndrome. I have for almost a year and a half. I go out of my way to better his life. No raise or even a thank you. I work until 10 most Fridays with a 10 hour day so he can belong to a bowling league and I get no praise. The paperwork tripled and I can't keep up with it and everything else and I haven't been paid my hours in 2 months and my gas reimbursement in 3 and a half. 

I am so burnt out.

Edit: I think I misexplained. I haven't been paid because I can't keep up with the paper work required to get my pay. I have to write the equivalent of a one page essay on the guy every night, plus the math for the mileage, and I just can't keep up. I was promised it would decrease after I complained, but it hasn't. It's my fault I haven't been paid.

This a picture of my stuffed doll, Baby. I got her 20 years ago for my first Christmas. She originally had an attached blanket on her wrist (left I believe) that was cut off from being holey when I was a kid. My understanding is that she was a FisherPrice doll that came in blue, yellow, or, like mine, pink terrycloth. Clearly, she has grown tattered over the years. I am hoping to be able to purchase another one. I have tried various searches over the last several years, and if you have any direction to offer, please feel free. Thank you. 




 I want genital changes and not really facial or body hair. Is this possible? 



















 I'm genderqueer, sorta somewhere not quite sure, but I'd like to have the possibility in the event that I choose to medically transition. I am applying for Obamacare in a few days and I was just wondering. I live in Pennsylvania if it matters. 




 My girlfriend, or well, fiance, and I are getting married December 10th! I am SO happy. We had originally planned our wedding for spring of 2016, but recently learned that if we did that, she would not be able to get financial aid for college. We are having a quick ceremony with a district magistrate and then having a small party. We are announcing it as our engagement, and that's great by me. She's happy about it, too. I am just so happy and wanted to share. 



















 I have been out for almost six years. I have been with my partner for over four. Last night, though we've had sex, even great sex, before, was the first time I've ever truly made love to a woman.

For the first time, I didn't emotionally compare it to what my expectations of sex with a man are. For one, they're unrealistic as I've never had sex with a man, and for two, it is so stupid to try to compare sex with a woman to sex with a man.

For the first time, I didn't have to fantasize to orgasm. Generally, I think about something I've read or watched, not really filling myself or my partner into any of the roles. It also generally involves a man. Last night, I didn't. When I tried to in order to finish faster, it made it more difficult. I didn't have to think at all; just feel.

For the first time, I was completely satisfied after I finished. I didn't really crave anything else. Typically, after my partner has gone to sleep, I will get myself off one more time before I fall asleep. Last night I had no desire to do that.

For the first time, I didn't concentrate on what might be best for her while she's touching me. I paid attention to me, since it was my "turn" anyway. I generally do whatever it takes to finish fast for her so she isn't left spending a million years on me. Last night, I just cared about what felt good and let myself enjoy it.

We discussed it afterword, and she felt the same way. She is the only woman I've ever dated, though, since I'm not even 20 and we've been together so long, it isn't that surprising. I'm the only woman she has ever dated. I guess there is still a bit of a learning curve, but I'm really looking forward to experiencing this and more again.  












































 My girlfriend has three little sisters; twin 15yo and the other will be 14 in the beginning of January. The twins have been asking my advice on skin care because mine is flawless (THANK YOU FOR TEACHING ME!) and they both have acne rather bad. The younger one has great skin but care isn't a bad thing and she's a copycat and would love it. Now, about their skin.

Twins; both girls have normal to oily skin, leaning slightly more toward oily. Both have acne, primarily in the form of white heads and some scarring due to their mother doing extractions. They are allergic to salicylic acid. Their goals are to clear up acne and my goal for them is to teach them the importance of skin care even when your skin is clear. Their skin is the opposite of mine so I don't really know what they need. They are on hormonal birth control to help control their acne as well.

Younger sister; normal skin that is clear with minor breakouts now and then but nothing extreme. Also allergic to salicylic acid, so my routine goes out the window dispite having very similar skin. She desires to prevent breakouts and be like her sisters. 

If you have specific product recommendations or anything to avoid, please, any advice helps. 




 My girlfriend and I have been together four years and are 19 and 20. My parents are rather poor and provide housing for us but we are responsible for our own food and cell phones and we pay the electric bill. My girlfriend's parents are both very well off and provide absolutely nothing for her, including emotional support. Their incomes have both increased dramatically over the last year, and her younger sister is no longer a dependent so her financial aid will be terrible and she does not benefit from her parents' money at all.


We live in a state with same sex marriage and are willing to go that route, as we plan to marry next spring anyway, but we would prefer to wait until then if possible. Can she get declared independent otherwise?

 My girlfriend is the oldest of five girls and was born to her mother when her mother and father were 19. She has a very poor relationship with her father and a so-so one with her mother. Her three youngest sisters and her get along great, but her other sister, the only one with the same father as my girlfriend, has had issues with my girlfriend since we got together. She has actively tried to ruin our relationship and give my girlfriend's parents false information about me to get them to hate me as well. It worked with her father.

Tonight, we went to dinner at her mom's for the first time in over six months. Her mother was insistent that my girlfriend get into contact with her sister. My girlfriend has been trying to talk to her sister, but her sister has no interest as, this summer, when her sister got "engaged" to a man she has known for 2 months and been dating for one, my girlfriend texted her asking exactly how long they had been together. We found out about her engagement via Facebook. Her mother, after my girlfriend's explanation, showed my girlfriend ultrasound pictures with sister's name on them. She is due in April.

My girlfriend tried to contact her sister through call and text, she ignored the texts and literally made sounds like she had no signal on the phone. She intentionally went to her friend's house so she wouldn't see us. Also, she and the "fiance" broke up and she is moving 3 hours away to live with their dad next week.

My girlfriend wants to be involved, but was asked not to let on that she knew. She wants to see her before she leaves as well. We have no idea what she should do.

**tl;dr**: Sister is pregnant and hiding it and won't talk to us and is moving away in a week. 



















 Also feel free to share any other relevant information such as if it was your first attempt at learning the language, etc. 









 Ma'am,
You passed so well that after walking away from you my girlfriend and I commented to each other on it. I assure you no one else was reading you. But I did. I read you when we made eye contact and you looked terrified that you thought I knew. It wasn't your height, even though you stood several inches above my 5'5". It wasn't your face, which was just as feminine as any other lady's face. It was your lack of confidence and fear that made me see any other indicators. I wanted in that moment so badly to hug you and tell you it was all okay and not to be so worried. Walmart at midnight may not be the safest place, but it also isn't the worst. No one even knew. You were just as safe as all other women in that store were and I wish there had been a way for me to communicate that to you. I hope my subtle smile and aversion of my eyes after our eye contact didn't further freighten you or make you think you didn't pass. I am proud of you for being yourself and presenting in public. I hope youbhave the courage to do it again, and maybe next time, if I see you, I'll have a better way to show you that I support you. 

Signed, 
The Lesbian from 2368. 









 We were riding in the car chatting about how, the previous night, she wanted me to cuddle her because she was feeling sick and I wanted sex because I was feeling horny. In order to not bother her, I opted to watch porn when she fell asleep. All in good fun, she was ribbing me about the fact that I hate her because I didn't cuddle her. I corrected her and said that I didn't cuddle her because I hate her is what she meant. Then, Reddit, I fucked up. I said "I don't hate you because you're fat, you're fat because I hate you." 




 I know Reddit circle jerks about how stupid it is but I don't know what it is. Please explain. 














 I'm sorry if this isn't allowed but I didn't know where else to ask. I work as a companion to a 29 year old man with Down Syndrome. Socially amd emotionally, I'd guess he's between 12 and 14, but he is illiterate to the point of not knowing the alphabet.  

We have rules about his cell phone. He isn't to call me before 7:50 am ever. Last week we added the rules that on Mondays I will call him at 10am to chat since I have off and don't want to be up that early and if he needs to call and I don't pick up, he calls once and I will call back.

In July we had a big issue because he called me at 6:30 in the morning. He hasn't been allowed to visit with some questionable friends since. Last Monday, he called at 7:30, leading to the establishment of the additional cell phone rules. 

Yesterday morning, while he knew I was on vacation, he called me four times between 7:52 am and 9:30 am. I chose not to call him because he gave up that privilege when he broke the rules. We spoke about it briefly this morning while I drove him to work and he says he won't do it again but I know he will and, rather than apologizing for his actions, he apologized for the fact that I was upset with him. 

What can I do to help set some better, stronger boundaries and get him to stick to them? Games and stuff are fine as long as they aren't geared at two year olds or overly wordy. Thank you so much! 









 Eateries you like, anything gay, whatever. 














 My girlfriend and I (lesbians) have managed to acquire a JW lady who keeps coming to us. We couldn't turn her away the first time because she came with my girlfriend's aunt, who is a Witness. Now the woman keeps coming back and even purchased each of us a "Bible" and another book. We don't want to convert, and we don't want to stop being lesbians. How do we nicely tell her we aren't even remotely interested without hurting her feelings? 




 I disagree with 99.9% of the things Reddit circlejerks about. 

I am a feminist, Chrisitan, lesbian who identifies as genderqueer. 

Basically, the majority of Reddit's outspoken members hate me and the feeling is rather mutual. I have been here almost a year and don't know why I keep coming back. 



















 Moving back with my parents soon to a 10' by 7' bedroom with 8' ceilings and three doorways. How would you make the most of this space? 









 We compared tongue size. When I woke up this morning I understood why guys compare dick size. 





























 I know you fart more because of contractions in the uterus also cause some in the GI tract, but why are they so smelly? 
























 It may be worth considering that you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. 




 So because you don't know a word I can't use it? The word existed long before I used it. 




 Do you have a question? 




 Is there a question? 




 My wife stacks her pills and doesn't deal with that  




 It's rarely relevant. Most people don't even know what it is and my preferred pronouns are obvious from my appearance, so there is no need to express such.  




 Not really a problem, but I appreciate your drunken concern. 




 Sorry, I was out car shopping.

I would say that in the sense that I experience dysphoric feelings, it's a disorder, though in the sense that something is "wrong" with me, I wouldn't. I learned in psychology in college that to be considered a mental illness, it has to cause negativity in your life. If you hear voices but they are encouraging and good, you're not mentally ill, despite the fact that it may be inconvenient. Based on that, while the dysphoric feelings suck, they don't in any way hinder my life, so no, I'm not experiencing a mental disorder or illness.

I don't know the cause. My "brain map" of my body isn't correct to what my body actually is. That seems like it's either psychological or body related. I don't much care how I'm perceived but I present more masculine, so that is a societal or environmental factor. 

I began identifying as genderqueer at around 14 or 15. I'm 20 now. I had a friend who came out as a transman and was doing research when I fell upon the term and it fit like a glove. I have memories from childhood that I call "signs I was trans". I can remember being 7 trying to make a prosthetic penis to pee through with a toilet paper roll. I can remember being about 9 and seeing an episode of SVU about transpeople and crying because I assumed by parents did that to me as a baby and couldn't just love me as the boy I was born as. I can remember praying for my period at 12 because I thought I would actually feel like a girl when I got it and it would prove that I was born one and was supposed to be one.  




 Yes, I have depression and anxiety. However, that has nothing to do with my gender identity. I have no other diagnosis so I won't claim any other.  




 http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genderqueer

http://gender.wikia.com/wiki/Transmasculine 




 Yes and no. One can simply identify as genderqueer, which is something of an umbrella term, and not wish to make any changes. I don't identify as 100% man 100% of the time, so I feel transman isn't fitting, but genderqueer is, however I am actually making an effort to transition just toward what exactly isn't quite defined. 

Edit: I'm the only female child in my family so female pronouns. I don't want to hurt my parents. 




 I read through his filmography on Wikipedia to answer your question, and, while I recognized many titles, I've never seen any. I don't really like movies, though. 




 It means that, while I don't wish to fully transition to being a man 100% of the time, I do wish to transition to being more masculine. The difference between this and simply being masculine is that I make changes, like binding my chest, to do so. I also will have my breasts removed eventually.  




 I think people should do whatever they want, provided it harms no one else. For me, I like having a label that I feel fits me. 

I've never seen anything with Bill Murray in it.  









 None of those subs are all that specific. Twox is only specifically about women and politics is only specifically about politics, based on name alone. /r/dicksprinkles is specific but not biased. 




 Got mine free on Facebook. The people were moving and needed to get rid of it, my wife and I wanted to upgrade from our full to a queen. It sits on a platform my dad and I built together and it's wonderful. 




 Consider adoption, if you and your wife can love an adopted baby the same way as a biological one. No shame if you can't, though, adoption isn't for everyone. My older brothers are both adopted since my parents "couldn't have kids" and they they had my younger brother and I biologically. It's great and I'm far closer to my adopted brother than my biological one. 




 I got one pair in 9th grade. They fell apart in less than six months.  




 You didn't bang a first time and objectification of OP isn't the way to get there anyway. 




 XI is 11. VI is 6. Just for future reference.  




 Wow... abusive much? Do you know anyone with PCOS and how there are various levels of seriousness of it and symptoms?  




 Go to church, pray in school, read the bible, etc. 




 Far the hell away from? 




 That's a line to get more than a handjob.  




 My mom got fired from selling Tupper Ware in the 80s because she got diagnosed with cancer and didn't have a party for three weeks. It was bullshit. 




 Mine has helped me a lot. He doesn't do anything questionable, either. He willingly sends people to orthopedic surgeons when needed. He performs x-rays and I have heard him tell people he can't help them. Most of my program included exercising the injured site, starting with passive stretching by a licensed massage therapist and then with help from a licensed personal trainer. He explains immediately in your first visit that he is not a medical doctor and if that makes you uncomfortable you are free to go elsewhere. My wife has PCOS and I speculated so for about six months. He met her once when she came with me and the next appointment he told me he thought she had it and that she needed to see a gynecological doctor immediately. He was right, obviously, and never tried to make me bring her for adjustments to help her. He stated that she needed hormonal treatment most likely in the form of birth control, which is right. I appreciate mine so much. He has been such a help in my life. 




 You went to a quack, that doesn't make all chiropractors quacks. Mine is great. He helped me with injuries from a car accident and has never pushed the herbal remedies he sells on me, just helps me with my back, as he is employed to do.  




 The point is that I disagree with something for my own arbitrary reasons. That doesn't mean I have to think other people can't do that thing.

Edit: the porn of little people I have seen looks like children and that freaks me out, if that's what you were asking. 




 I think that watching midget porn is gross and creepily close to childporn and wrong but others have the choice to do so. 




 But the pharmaceutical companies want their money and will do anything to harm you and your family to get it!!!!!!!!! 




 Uhm no. I'm a woman married to a woman. I am high libido, she is low. Marriage has nothing to do with money; it's about love and commitment. I don't make any money as I'm unemployed at the moment and I want more sex. You are so wrong. 




 That's what I meant; hippies and wiccans alike are counter culture with strong, far from mainstream beliefs. As a recently former teenage girl, they (we?) Get a bad rep for insisting they are something they know nothing about, but that's just teens in general.  




 WHO NEEDS A HOUSE OUT IN HACKENSACK? 




 Wiccans get a bad rep because they are like the equivalent of hippies, and teenage girls think they are Wiccan.  




 Honestly, in schools. World Religions is required in a lot of places. When I learned it in sixth grade, we learned of the Abrahamic religions (and a bunch of others) but not how they were connected; my mom explained it. It would help cure a lot of hatred. 




 A poor people rock where geography isn't a priority. 




 Dude. I get you mean to be sweet, but you are sort of treating OP like a commodity. Good effort, bad approach.  




 I have a fear to the point of a full blown phobia. I will probably have nightmares from these pictures tonight and I can't even go near a snake if I have a lawn mower. I am petrified of them. Though, I am working on it with subs like that one. 




 How many people do you live with. 




 Heiney? 




 Snakes terrify me. But I totally agree. I love the way that community fawns over their little guys and girls the same way I do my buns. It takes some of the terror out. 




 Touch.  




 I also got married. At 20. My wife would have had to drop out so we got hitched. Still very happy about that decision.  









 Well there are. Guys can even do it missionary. It's not that complex. 




 Probably all the aftermath of the last episode. The wreckage of their lives. Jesus either dead or in boarding school, and coping with that change. Ana either dead or fighting to keep her baby. Marianna dealing with her brother gone and possibly her bio mom and/or sister. Responsibility for the accident and what about Brandon's car? The kiss with Monte and Lena and if that wrecks the marriage of Stef and Lena, which I doubt it will. Just my predictions.  




 You two look great. 




 When it comes up 3 years in a seemingly life long relationship it's childish. He has strung OP along for three years. 









 Iam*Judger*AMA 




 I agree. Obviously if your health and safety depend on it, then it's fine, but being stealth is being a closet case and being a closet case helps no one. Don't expect others to stand for your rights if you won't stand for them.  




 "Hunk" and "Future Model" type shirts don't get to me. At that point, babies don't have much to offer but their looks. Nothing wrong with saying they're beautiful, male or female. Now, by 6 months when they are actually doing things, it's about accomplishments.  




 I'd like you to join us over at The Gay Agenda ^^^tm. Just look us up in the rainbow pages. 




 I thought bikers stole chaps from Cowboys and leprechauns stole rainbows from Noah/God and "normies" stole marriage from religion? It's almost like cultural shifts occur. 




 I thought this was /ftm and I was like "Honey... you're beautiful but you REALLY look like a girl." Then I realized that was exactly what you were going for you you're still beautiful and still look like a girl. 




 Or just learn to tuck. 




 11 year old me would have totally wanted 11 year old you. Then we both would grow up to be gay. 




 It's cool. I'm 20 and Harry Styles is the only man for me. Love me some 1D. 




 Dude no. My mom still won't "let" me have black hair in my face and I'm still pissed I couldn't be emo in middle/high school. Own that shit. 




 Beetlejuice is great! It's a dark comedy and a family story.  




 There's four of us. My mother in law is EXACTLY like Mother Gothel. My wife and I love it for that reason.  




 You loved her, and at some point only wanted the best for her. Continue that. Wish her happiness. And you will find it, too.  




 I'd have yelled at you too. The fuck is wrong with you thinking you should be a woman at 8? 




 Yes 




 I'm the person who's car got stolen. I was hit on Thursday two weeks ago. The adjuster ignored calls and didn't inform me that he was taking my car. I hadn't even agreed to the amount he offered. I showed up today to have my car cleaned out to learn he towed it an hour away with all of my stuff in it. 




 Posting for a friend.

Today, I finally got around to dealing with an accident that happened two weeks ago. I work for a company that rhymes with smationsmide. They haven't sent the title because I've been avoiding their calls and so today I got them good. I stole their car and didn't tell them and shipped it an hour away with all of their stuff in it. They have no money, no car, and none of their stuff now and I got them good! 




 Walmart as a corporation has phenomenal equality provisions. The do not discriminate at all. Specifically the store by me, there are employees of every race; employees that don't speak English, deaf employees, those with cerebral palsy or chromosomal defects, LGBT employees and more. 

My mom worked at Walmart for 14 years and was exposed to the ins and outs. A specific store may have problems with this, but as a corporation Walmart isn't as bad as people try to say. 




 Mostly, yeah, if you never wake up you die. 




 As a Pennsylvanian with friends from New England, this war happens every time we play Monopoly but I know I'm right so it's okay.  




 It also sort of glorifies cutting in Specials. My mom was nervous about me reading that at 12/13. 




 On Scott Westerfeld's website there was talk of a TV series. I think that would kill it though. 




 You mean the post-apocalyptic series that is far better than The Hunger Games and Divergent but isn't a movie yet? 




 20/F/PA.

U? 




 /u/TrollaBot test_subject6752 




 We waited until exactly two days after I turned 20 because we didn't want to be another "teen marriage" statistic lol.  




 Did you just change your diet or add exercise? 




 I got married in December at age 20. My wife and I have been together four and a half years. I don't think it's always too soon or too young. 









 I'm genderqueer afab. I like porn in that realm because I would like to *be* the pre/non op transwoman. I want to have my dick sucked and my boobs played with. Though, I rarely consume such porn because it's so transphobic and it makes me feel guilty. 




 It's the kind of tree you get golf tees from. 




 Yeah. That's pretty homophobic. Why are you here if you're just going to make lesbian jokes? 




 It's sexist because it's impossible the description only fits girls. And the opposite can not only fit men. 




 I'm thinking (and hoping) that he/she is suggesting that people properly train before using firearms because in his/her experience that isn't the case and it can be incredibly dangerous.

FTFY
 




 Oh. Wow I feel like a dick. Whenever I post a screen cap I get shit for my phone font. I have a galaxy s4 and the font is called Choco Cooky.  




 My preference.  




 With the proper training and licenses, But lets not make this standard. Some of the people I have known shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a gun.  


Why be sexist?
 




 1. Lemon juice had citric acid, which is awful for you. Look for it in ingredients when shopping.

2. Huge granulated sugar is not good. Chemical exfoliation is better for you. 

I'm sure there are others but that's what jumped out at me.

Edit: apparently I'm wrong. Live and learn. 




 "Natural" people scare me. They are generally intelligent enough to research and learn but they believe blatantly biased sources.  




 She probably would have been better off getting sunburn and taking a brillo pad to it. At least then she'd be admitted and they would take away the lemons and sugar. 




 An extra two dollars a box for someone to write the word on it.  









 Victoria's? 




 Smirnoff Ice tastes exactly like Jolly Ranchers. 




 Ibuprofen doesn't have a diuretic or antihistamine, both of which help clear up mucus and make things flow a bit better. 




 I could say it ain't so but darlin, what's the use?

The darker the chocolate yhe richer the taste

Now if that's where it's at then run and tell that!


I didn't know the soundtrack to Hairspray was considered rap. 




 I'm gonna kill you!

 And he can take it whenever he wants no questions asked and transport whoever he wants and whatever he wants. I'm sure he is also free to repaint it chartreuse and add orange flames. Since the car is his and all. 




 He lives there. That doesn't make it his. If he drives your car it's not suddenly his. 




 No, it isn't. She doesn't pay the rent/mortgage or the bills. She isn't responsible for her or anyone else's wellbeing.  




 You mean if she had "done the decent thing" and not had sex in her father's house this wouldn't have happened? 




 No, a guy calling someone a predator for being in his own house when his child was having sex is a weirdo. 




 In HIS house. She is 16, it's his house and he is free to stay. He wasn't in the room or anything. I hope you don't have children because you seem like an absolute weirdo. 




 Lesbian here; I prefer my wife and I to use different stuff. I like when she smells different than me. 




 This is sort of... wrong... buuuut I'll bite. Subarus are lesbian cars. 




 She reddited too. That's pretty sad... 




 No. He's teasing his kid. 




 20 year old lesbian here. Outright tell her. Tell her gay, straight, doesn't matter to you. Tell her you love her unconditionally.  




 Oh god I just realized how horrifying it is that I reddited a ton the night of my wedding. 




 Pizza makes me break out :( 

But I eat it anyway so I guess I'm more of a skincare social user. 









 Oh snap. This is why I shouldn't comment before I'm actually awake. 




 Mine hasn't been coming but last month my mom was diagnosed with non alcohol related cirrhosis. When she told me it came. 




 My period has been super irregular for the last year and a balf. Last week, it decided only after 22 days since the previous one, that it was coming. I woke up with a brand new sheet destroyed and apparently my sleep self was unhappy with the moisture because I had ripped the sheet up and *tucked it into my crotch*. I had been sleeping naked.  




 I'm transmasculine/genderqueer and currently identify as a lesbian. I'm married to a beautiful woman who, despite being 100% certain that she is gay, completely supports me and recognizes that top surgery is an inevitability and is fine with that. I know I will probably transition one day, if I can be sure it means not losing my family, but I know my wife will continue to identify as a lesbian and that is fine by me. Other transguys I know have dated girls that identify as lesbians and I have seen some relationships go from lesbian to straight. 

Have any of you guys had relationships like this? Would any of you begin a relationship with a woman who identified as a lesbian? I'm not looking for validation; I'm trying to start a conversation. 




 As many fuck ups, this happened roughly 10 years ago. I was about 10 and needed to poop. It was midsummer and, living in the Poconos (Northeast Pennsylvania) it was quite hot out. At this time, there was no air conditioning in our house, so windows were all open. Knowing this was going to be a long poop, I decided to find a means of entertaining myself. 

The previous Christmas, my Grammy had gotten me and my brother a kid size accordian to share. We had barely touched it. I figured this was as good a time as any, so I made sure it would make sound, and headed to the bathroom.

I sat down and began trying different notes. I've always been pretty good with music; singing in church since age 3, clarinet since 8, so I could recognize notes by sound pretty easily. I figured out the beginning of the song and played it a few times while trying to figure out the next part.

It was going spectacularly and I was so excited to be able to share my learnings with my family. I went down stairs after I was done, and went out on the front porch to tell my parents the news.

I was greeted by my parents, brother, and several neighbors singing the song to me and then asked how my trip to the bathroom went. 

TL;DR London Bridge was falling down and embarrassment was falling up. 









 We have been married for three months, together four and a half years. Before we got married, sex was roughly weekly. On our wedding night, she fell asleep in the middle of it. We had sex several times the first week and then it plummeted. I don't think we had sex at all I'm February and have once this month, where it was all me touching her and I barely got kissed. She offers to take care of me but I'm not even allowed to touch her breasts. I want to make love to my wife. I constantly feel rejected and unattractive. I love her and want to be with her but I hate feeling like this. 




 For almost a year, I have been paying for the unlimited card with bring your own phone. My phone is a red LG phone with a slide out keyboard. It's not a smart phone. When I had AT T the Internet use was disabled because it wasn't a part of the plan and we didn't want any upcharges. I don't know how to turn it back on and it's really inconvenient because I can't get picture messages. How can I turn it back on? If this isn't the right place I'm sorry but I didn't know where else to look. 














 My wife and I have recently realized that a large majority of lesbian sex media is centered around small, athletic bodies. Obviously not all lesbians are small, athletic people. What are your choice ways of making love to your lady, if one or both of you don't fit that stereotype? 




 I live in a semi-rural area. Girls get pregnant way too young here all the time. It's not Bible Belt area though, so it's not really a big deal to most people. It's a big deal to me, though. I'm going to college so I can one day support my family doing something that I love and am passionate about. I'm married to my partner, whom I've been with for four and a half years. All I want is a baby, but we can't have one because we are only 20 with no real way to afford one. Her sister, who is 18, is due in April and is getting everything handed to her for it. When we were 200 dollars short on rent because my job didn't pay me, they told us they knew this would happen and we were stupid to move out. But here we are, working hard at our goals, not having the one thing I really want, and it doesn't seem to do any good! We had no transportation for the last six weeks so we are yet another semester behind due to having to withdraw. We moved back in with my parents to save up toward our goals, but it doesn't matter because all of our money goes to household stuff anyway! I feel like I will never be able to have a family, which is all that I want. I know it's not a good time, and I know that we can't afford it and don't have enough room for a baby, but it's the only thing I want and it sucks that I feel punished for doing what's right. 

TL;DR: I want a child and can't have one because I can't afford it, but other people get to screw up and have just that. 




 I'm just so disappointed. I live about 80 miles from the city and have all my life, and last year was my first time there at all and at a pride event bigger than four stands in a park. I feel so bad for her, but it really sucks we don't get to march. 




 (Posted for my brother's girlfriend) So my boyfriend and I decided to take my three dogs to PetSmart to get them new stuff. While he was doing something in the car, I loaded the three of them into a shopping cart together. It was cold and I was tired of waiting for him, so I set off toward the store. I was a bit annoyed that he was taking so long, so, when he began yelling my name as I walked into the store with my cart load of dogs, I ignored him. This was where I fucked up. I turned around to see him yelling and continued into the store. That's when I saw the phones and people dressed in blue and yellow. I brought a cart full of dogs into Best Buy, the store next to PetSmart.

TL;DR: my boyfriend tried so save me from bringing my three dogs into Best Buy and failed. 




 I have no idea when the last time I posted in this sub was but I was banned several days ago. Mods will not answer me, so I tried to ask on the ask sub, and I am banned there, too. I asked in modmail there, and all I got was a message that if I continue to message modmail, I'll be reported for modmail disruption. I responded that I needed an answer and I'm more than willing to stop messaging modmail when I get one. No response after that. I wouldn't care but it's the sub about a view I hold very strongly and I don't understand how I could be banned. It's really unfair and I just want to know why it happened. 




 My friend wants to get one next week. He's looking for black skin tone, stp and sex capable. He wants it circumcised and durable. Any recommendations of products you guys have used and liked? 














 He is painting it black and gray, from yellow, which my mom picked out 30 years ago. I'm not contesting that it needed paint long ago, but he is making it awful. He didn't bother to tape the ceiling, which he doesn't plan to paint, the trim is hideous with both black and gray on it because he taped it poorly and it just looks awful. He painted cabinets multiple colors and poorly at that without asking first. He has stuff all over and is taking a very long time to finish. Each night, and whenever he isn't painting, he puts his painting supplies in the bathtub so no one can bathe. You have to go through the kitchen to turn the heat on, and we live in the north east. My mom has a ton of medical problems and needs to have access to food, heat, and the bathroom. She doesn't want to say anything because she is grateful he is trying to help, but he is really causing problems.

TL;DR: my brother is trying to help but is making a bigger problem. 




 I know you have to be clean for something like a year, but wouldn't it make more sense to put nonalcoholics ahead on the list since they didn't make themselves sick? I'm not asking for a change my view, I just want to know why they qualify for it. 









 She is my best friend and my mom. She's wonderful. She was a foster and adoptive and biological mother and she took in my now wife when we were 17 and her mother through her out. She's my hero. And today she was diagnosed with non-alcohol related cirrhosis. She actually actively decided not to be an alcoholic as her father was one. Please, just pray for her. I'm so destroyed right now. I'm only 20. I'm not ready for this at all. 














 DAE too cool for Super Bowl?

DAE atheist?

DAE not care about -insert big/popular thing- 
























 I had sociology last semester and there is a word for this. If I remember correctly it's called the second shift. Women who work are still expected to do the cooking and cleaning and laundry and child rearing. Men often cook maybe once a week on a grill and have a Saturday chore of mowing the lawn and washing the car.  




 Can we say butch lesbian instead? That's rather offensive with that phrasing. 




 Did you survive the seizure? 




 There are intersex people and people whose bodies don't quite line up with male and female because they are transitioning.  




 "Doodle Dog is beat and so am I." 




 "Hey baby, did you know that the uh mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell? It's kinda like how these guns are the powerhouse of this." 




 Did you sing the one about the fish with the pig like nose? That's the one I remember, not the song from hsm2  




 I'm also in PA. Going down the shore is a pretty regular thing. 




 I think he should suck it up and just do it. It's just hair. 




 She is over the age of consent and can therefore make a decision on what to do with her body and her baby. She isn't 10. She can legally work and provide for a child. Birth control failure happens. It doesn't make her irresponsible.  




 You know nothing about me or my wife or our relationship other than what is here, which is a poor decision and a shitty family member. You have nothing to draw that conclusion from. Also, you need to learn to spell and figure out what homophones are. 




 I'm sorry that was confusing. She remains cordial so that he will pay for her phone. He pays for her phone because he knows he otherwise won't have her number. I don't communicate with him at all and only see him when needed. I haven't spoken to him since the week after Christmas when he gave my wife her gift. She hasn't spoken to him since except on her birthday two weeks ago. 




 Her father outright states that he despises me. My wife does not want him involved in our lives at all. He abused both of us in the past. I tried to push her to invite him since he is her dad but she didn't want him to know. My family and hers have nothing to do with one another. It was really just having her mom and four sisters not spill the beans. Her three youngest sister didn't say a word, nor did her mother. Her other sister did it intentionally to cause problems. 




 Luckily, I'm not in a sitcom. We needed 5 people not to share and four did it with no problem. Her sister, on the other hand, was purely malicious. 




 Her family acts that way, not my wife. She is just nonconfrontational and doesn't know how to deal with it. Also I'm a woman as well so it has nothing to do with sexism. 




 Go to your county assistance office. Often you can get temporary help for situations like this one. 




 When I was a kid I liked to scratch my head on my dad's beard like this. 




 I probably should but I think I'll be busy deleting Facebook and finding a lawyer. 




 My wife is aware but her family is kind of like, "well that's just (name)." She tried to shove me down some stairs at a Christmas party in front of everyone but then I caught the wall and she ran to the bathroom. I let it go because I wasn't about to be the one in the wrong when parts of her family are just starting to come around after her years of lies. 




 I already didn't want to go. I see it as a waste of money and time. I have never liked these people and since I would otherwise have to stay with my former abuser, I will either have to drive back down or get a hotel. My wife agrees with me about this. 

I think you give really good advice. Even though they are connected, the three are separate issues. Damage control seems to only be possible if we are honest and explain all of it to the family members. My wife plans to deal with her sister after she gives birth. This isn't the first time her sister has done things like this but for us it will be the last. My wife intends to pretty much go no contact with her sister except in regards to her nephew. It is for the best if I don't talk to the sister in law because my anger and hatred will explode and then her father will get involved and it will be ugly as ever.  




 I am a woman, since clearly you can't read.

My wife and I made the decision together to not tell her family, and her sister knew and defied it. I don't need anything else to hate her. She physically attacked me. That's reason enough. 




 The baby is the first of his generation and my wife is expected to be there. This sister is also her only whole sibling; the other three are from her mom's second marriage, so her father has a weird hang up about it. She doesn't have her licence yet and we both have agreed that she is not to be around her father without me. She doesn't want to be around her father at all so she doesn't want to go, but she is a people pleaser and doesn't want to disrupt the family. 




 Yes, yes it does. 




 Her sister was told directly not to tell people and intentionally defied it. 




 Her family is kind of crazy. She has a 37 year old uncle who walks past me and ignores me at family functions. His wife also will only give me dirty looks or talk about her dog. This stupid, immature behavior is the kind of thing I experience every time I'm around them. 

The wedding happened so fast. We went from being in a long term committed relationship to being married in 6 weeks, not even really having an engagement. Since it happened so fast, we didn't get much time to think about who to invite and we decided that no one in my wife's family needed to know besides her mother and four younger sisters. The other family members live far away and we felt that asking them to take a day off of work to drive several hours for a wedding that was mostly just for legal purposes was pointless and unfair, especially since we will be having a big wedding in a year. 

When her cousin asked, we didn't know she knew and assumed it was confusion since it was asked in such a way that that made sense. We were maintaining what we thought they all knew as the truth. 

Our omission was meant to save feelings and avoid hurting people. We also felt that, if we chose to share it, doing so at her other cousin's wedding was not the place. 




 The life lesson is that you can take way more than you think and being able to share that shows what a strong person you are. 




 My wife and I have been married for four months and together four and a half years. We had just begun planning our wedding when we found out that she was set to lose her financial aid for school. We talked to my parents and her mom and they all understood that unless we got married, my wife had to drop out. We didn't want anyone to know since it happened really fast and we couldn't afford to invite anyone. It was in the middle of the day on a Wednesday so no one could have really made it anyway. In an effort to avoid hurt feelings we only had our immediate families there. We put on Facebook that we were engaged.

My wife's sister, who was 18 and pregnant at the time, instead scheduled a doctors appointment and skipped her sister's wedding. She has tried to sabotage our relationship from the beginning; she has told both of my wife's parents terrible lies about me and has even physically attacked me before. She only knew we were getting married because she lived with my wife's mom at the time. 

My wife's cousin got married this weekend and we were asked by her other cousin if we were married. We said no, as that is what we agreed upon. We found out that her sister told the family that we are in fact married. I am livid. It was not her place to do that and I'm tired of her invading my life whenever she can. My wife's father, who abused my wife and I in the past, was also not supposed to know, but we are sure she told him as well.

She is being induced this Wednesday and I have made it clear that I will not be driving two hours to her father's house to see her. My mother in law is angry that I won't do this but I can't stand my father in law or sister in law. My wife agrees but doesn't want trouble. What should I do?

Tl;dr: sister in law is an asshole and I'm expected to coddle her. 




 Rand Paul thinks same sex couples should just have "contracts" not marriages or unions.

 The thumbnail looks like a dick. 




 When twox became a default, I had discovered trollx and I unsubbed over there and never looked back. 




 No, not really. Men are assertive or leaders or have a take charge personality. Those are all considered positive. 




 You're right. *Most* people aren't, but these types of things seem to draw the creepy neckbeards out of the woodwork. It's probably too late to get enough bathroom attendants now.  









 ... Have you actually been on Reddit? Creepshots from conventions like this are a regular thing. 









 You should also probably leave out hermaphrodite as well. A hermaphrodite is truly both 100% male and 100% female which doesn't happen in humans. 




 Women, who push for things, are called bossy bitches. 




 Intersex is the word you are looking for. 




 Yep. Transmen are porn penis free.

Edit: not porn. Born. 




 I haven't really played since 2010 and I don't want to allow myself to get sucked back in. 




 I wouldn't say the parent is a creep but in that position I would remind my child that genital touching is to be done alone. 




 It's TIL, it isn't supposed to he current events. 




 Well that's like, your opinion man. 




 Oh god if I ever need something to make me childfree this is it. 




 This law just changed where I live. I'm a social work student and it's preposterous that until now a degree in engineering makes you qualified to be a case worker. 




 It may be different in Germany, but in the US ultrasounds are internal unless there is a problem or you are pregnant enough that external will work.

 Perhaps you should consider attending a PFLAG meeting to help you come out. 




 It totally is! How did your mom as a nun have a child? I assume she was not a nun before you so how did she decide to be come a nun? How old were you? How has it affected you? What are some weird rules nuns have to follow? My uncle is a monk and they can't dance with women. Where is your dad? It is REALLY interesting.  




 No, it wouldn't. In that case it is not sexually transmitted. If you rim someone with cholera you can get cholera but that doesn't make it an sti. 




 Congratulations, pain in the butt!  




 If you don't want the kid to be a brat, stop humble bragging. Don't teach that behavior.  




 Maybe you should be more grateful for gifts and less controlled by your husband. 




 Do an AMA! 




 Thank you, kind stranger, who knows one fact about my relationship.  




 Actually she's sitting next to me at Friendly's across from my Nigeria best friend. 




 She's gay. I can say with 100% certainty that she's never banged a dude. 




 I'd be risking my relationship if she realized too late that she can't handle it. She doesn't want to sleep with anyone else. 




 Hey baby. You dropped something. My jaw. 




 I was 15 and it was also too soon. 




 I didn't save myself for marriage, but my wife and I started dating when I was 15. She knows that I totally want to sleep with other people and I have her permission to explore. I just love her too much to risk it all for an hour of fun.  




 No, I think women just want someone experienced. I'm a lesbian. I would not sleep with or date a virgin. There is just too much responsibility in making sure you don't fuck their first time up. Maybe it's because women put more emotional value in virginity loss and to men it's more of an accomplishment.

All my opinions based on generalizations of course.  




 For real. Best tweezer I ever lost* were a dollar from ELF.

 If you hate everyone, why watch? 




 I seriously hope someone beat you to the punch. 




 That's the best part of neckbeards! 




 I live a few hours from Philly, where the Mazzoni(sp?) center is, which is where most of my friends got their T. I keep thinking about using some of this money to do that, but I didn't think I wanted hormones right now. 

I have round about discussed being trans with my mom and she is 100% not on board. My dad makes comments about transpeople that say he is the same. My wife would be fine with it, as we have discussed it at length, but we currently live with my parents. 

I'm just really not sure where I am right now on all of this and it sucks. I generally don't bother to bind because it doesn't really work anyway but when I do my dysphoria is all but gone. I am open with my whole family about the fact that top surgery is an inevitability and they all seem okay with it as I've explained it that my chest is too big, but a reduction can put me at higher risk for cancer so they're on board. 

I'm sorry if this is all over the place but any insight would help. 




 Reddit doesn't seem to understand that choice is just that - choice. The hive mind says that it's our decision (as almost an entirely male population) who has to have an abortion. They don't believe women should have the choice to *not* abort. 




 Stepping up to take care of family members he doesn't have to = chump. 

I'd hate to be related to you. 




 True, but Hillary is an old dog in the game. She's been around longer. 




 I agree but someone super left won't get elected.  




 She changed her position on that issue. On a personal level, she doesn't feel that "marriage" is the best word but she doesn't politically believe in taking away other's rights.  




 I haven't shaved since December and will maybe shave two more times this year. I don't grow body hair quickly and it's thin and blonde when I do. I'm more masculine anyway so screw it. My wife has PCOS and grows hair so fast you can hear it. She Nairs every other week and I only hate when it's in the stubble stage.  




 Your welcome for the new fetish. Seriously though could you imagine Elizabeth Warren as President with Rachel Maddow as our first lady? 




 I've told my wife that I would leave her for Elizabeth Warren. She said that's fine as long as she can have Rachel Maddow. Elizabeth Warren is going to be president someday, I firmly believe, but that day is not today. She is just too wonderful for the right to go for it. 




 Aside from her last name, why not her? 




 And the right would say it was a cat fight and neither would get elected. I don't think having two women from the left run at the same time for our first female president is going to be a good idea. 




 A vote for a third party is a waste of your vote. You know it won't actually go anywhere, better to go for the better of the two evils. 




 Disclaimer: I'm left than left and love Elizabeth Warren.

She is too left. Hillary is much more moderate and older, helping to secure votes. She is a known name and not for rocking the boat out right on things that people more right don't want rocked. Elizabeth Warren can't secure the votes because she is too young and too new and too left for the comfort of most. I also doubt that she will run and step on Hillary Clinton's toes to try to be the first female president, which I personally find admirable. If they both run, the right will construe it as a sexist cat fight and that will make them both lose. 

Personally, I'm voting for Hillary Clinton because I like her and what she stands for. 




 It's against reddiquette to post personal information.  




 I graduated in 2012 in the Poconos. I was on the rifle team and it still exists, shooting .22 rifles in the range on school grounds. 




 Well being is affected by the law though in this case. 




 Typically in video games, when the player gets frustrated and flips out and quits playing. 




 When you ask someone out, it's assumed that you will pay and it makes you look cheap not to.  




 At first I thought maybe you were a troll, but I checked your profile out and apparently you are rage quitting. Isn't there somewhere more entertaining to do that? 




 Want to see my skin that has had maybe a dozen pimples in my lifetime that looks even better since following my routine? Didn't think so, but I thought I'd offer. 




 Guys listen up we have a skincare genius in our midst. 




 I think that grouping other people that way is wrong and counterintuitive but when people group themselves a certain way it's not really wrong to theorize why. I'm not saying that a transman is the same as a woman or vice versa but there is a common element. 




 And femme lesbians for being invisible and passing as straight.  




 Transpeople are certainly their transitioned-to gender from birth, but transmen experience objectification by men from a young age and transwomen are told that trucks and sports are what they need to be in to. They experience society as their assigned sex until transition, when they experience it from their gender.  




 Well, people are socialized as children based on their assigned gender. That's a pretty common theme. 




 From what I've seen, you're correct. Afab people like tumblr because it's more pro afab people, where reddit is more amab oriented.  




 That's like saying men aren't privileged because of Women's colleges and whites aren't privileged because there are Black Student Unions or straights aren't privileged because of gay bars.

Edit: I'm not saying my answers are right, just that groups are definitely privileged. I don't think it's possible to prove that masculine gay men are not the most privileged group of lgbt people, aside from perhaps straight transmen that pass extremely well. 




 I'm a genderqueer lesbian, so my perspective is skewed, but here is how I see it:

Gay men, particularly masculine bear types on top; rather "normal" and the male privilege to boot. Feminine gay men are a close second.

Lesbians, femme on top with varying degrees of butch behind them. 

Then, we have branches. Transmen get male privilege when they pass but all the medical advances really give transwomen the privilege, so it is really about which matters more to the individual. As a whole, society doesn't love transpeople. 

Bi people fall within their respective gay/straight depending upon their relationship at the time, though they deal with erasure based on their relationships. If they are with someone they are immediately either gay or straight and whores if they are single or have multiple partners.  




 Totally easy; pigtails = avoid; spikes = new best friend. 




 Not a chart, but a summary. 

Everyone (gay and straight) call bi people whores, so they don't like anyone.

Lesbians don't like bi people because of too many "bi" girls who just want to experiment. This fuels bi hatred of lesbians because they claim it is "bi erasure".

Transpeople think that everyone hates them so they hate everyone first. Straight people think they are just really gay, gay people think gender and sexuality shouldn't be lumped.

Gay men hate more feminine gay men for being attention whores.

Lesbians don't like straight men because they feel objectified; straight men in turn feel that lesbians try to out-masculinize them. 

I think that's about it. 




 Actually, they *can* just let you hang free. They don't tell boys to wear briefs to make their nuts look better. 




 No. Trans*vest*ites wear the clothes. Trans*gender* people are the gender. 




 No need! I was just confused at first that I thought I fixed it and it was back and then I was confused that four minutes later I got another notification about it lol. 




 Did you even look to see that someone else already told me lol?

Edit: you can't take criticism and he is trolling? Bullshit. 




 If you rent your landlord can lose their house for your possession. You have to buy somewhere so a deal gone bad *can* happen. Regardless of what you want to be true, most drugs *are* illegal so yes, that's an issue. Because of that major difference, you cannot realistically draw a comparison with drinking and gambling.  




 Maybe he opted as an adult to be circumcised because of phimosis. 




 Just support your guy. My wife's father hates me. We have been together 4.5 years but his 2 year relationship to his 2nd/4th wife is more valid than ours. I avoid her father because he is awful. 




 If the nurse at school ever did that to my child we would have a MAJOR issue. 




 I down voted you. It *is* still a problem. You put the entire household at risk if you are caught. You run the risk of falling back into addiction instead of just use. You risk a deal gone bad and your mother coming to identify your body. If you have children you put their lives and sense of normalcy at risk. It's not "fine". 




 Call and find out! Worst they can say is  no!

 I crave Italian food so much when I have my period. Though, at first I thought this was a horrible marinara sauce joke. 




 My wife and I went to Olive Garden for dinner tonight for our 4 months married/4.5 years together anniversary. I was holding the door for a couple coming out and the man called me sir! I wasn't even trying to pass, just wearing a striped shirt and sports bra over Levis and he called me sir! Then he corrected himself but who cares because I got called sir! 




 With the added benefit of lacerations! 




 Health care for everyone? Removal of DADT? Federally recognized same sex marriage? 




 So its like your dad was Danny Devito and your hubby is Arnold Schwarzenegger but they are actually secretly twins? 




 The problem is that a lot of dads really do this and it's not a good thing. 




 Sadly, yes, plenty of them are. Though, if you recognize this I'm guessing you aren't.  




 Hey, if you didn't do it, don't feel bad. But work to combat the behavior in your loved ones that a male. 




 That's not a great mentality to have, either. You don't own them any more than another man does. They own their own bodies. Yes, when they are young and don't know any better you need to protect them, but they aren't your objects either.  




 I agree. But she isn't stupid. She must know that exactly that is going to happen. She is still making the choice to do it. That doesn't make the actions of the guys here okay, but it is still her body and her choice. 




 It's a start. Generally my comments on defaults are down voted to hell. Maybe someone will realize that it's true in all situations.  




 I'm gonna let you go back and reread. 




 How is it anti feminist? Her body, her choice.  




 Really, slavery only existed about 150 years ago. That could mean that your great great grandparents had slaves, meaning someone not as distant as you think. Also, slavery ending wasn't racism ending. Schools were only forced to integrate a bit more than 60 years ago; I'm 20 and my dad was born before schools were integrated. That's no reason to apologize for someone else's actions, but it wasn't as long ago as it should have been, and knowing that hits a little closer to home.  




 I'm 20 and married, to another woman. It's double the screaming ovaries and the "well we are married..." but we also have no degree and live with my parents and it has to wait but try to tell all these ovaries that.  




 Be careful with Capella. It's like University of Phoenix and often you can't get a job because you went there. The degree isn't worth the paper it's written on. 




 I, too, breathed out my nose. 




 That's not a relationship and the fact that you call it one goes on to prove your insecurity.  




 It has nothing to do with ratio. It has to do with peace and quiet. There are 6 people in my three bedroom house. There is no where that is calm and quiet but the bathroom. 




 I screwed up royally and dropped 18 credits this semester due to my mom being diagnosed with cirrhosis and my being depressed and a whole host of other issues.  I had previously dropped 9 credits and repeated 3 of them. I have 25 credits complete of 52 attempted at this point and am working on my appeal. If I retake classes, does that lower my attempted number? Right now I know I need 30 credits in the next semester to get it back, which is impossible. Do I get a year or just a semester? Should I repeat classes? It's a 2 year program. 




 You are aware that this sub is an ama sub not change my view, correct? I am in no way obligated to debate my identity with you. 
























 It means Trans Excluding Radical Feminist. I assume you're confused about the meaning. 




 I am a feminist and I did back peddle to explain a mistake I had made, so I suppose so, though this topic has little to do with feminism. Feminists, those who aren't TERFs anyway, do pay attention to trans* rights, but that doesn't make trans* issues only feminine issues. Sort of like, a square is a rectangle but a rectangle isn't a square. 




 Well, as you can see by my edit, I confused gender identity and gender roles. Gender identity is hardwired by brain "maps" if you will that dictate how the body should be lined up. I'm not really a mechanics type person, but I don't think transmissions have anything to do with biology. 




 Gender roles are a social construct, so in a sense, no it doesn't exist. However, traffic laws are also social constructs and they exist, in a sense. As long as we recognize social constructs, they exist.

Edit: my mistake, confused gender and gender roles.

Edit 2: confused rolls and roles. 




 "Faggot" is actually only used for gay men. There is a separate derogatory term for lesbians.  




 Wow... Usually I check on stuff like that. So much for helping. 




 As a lesbian and a gay rights advocate, it would be quite troubling if I were a homophobe. 




 No, I haven't experienced racism. Though, I am a genderqueer lesbian who presents fairly masculine, so I have experience the bad side of bigotry for being a minority. I wasn't rude to you, I simply explained a conceptual difference. I once made the same mistake myself and the person who explained it to me wasn't so kind, so I thought I'd do it nicely before that person showed up. 




 I'm not denying anything. Also, denying something doesn't make someone a bigot. A Holocaust denier is most likely a bigot, but if they rely just don't believe it happened, they are ignorant, as they ignore facts presented. 




 Yes and no. What you defined is institutionalized racism. A person's remarks can still be racist without real power, though words have power. It's an easy mix up. 




 More homophobia. How attractive!

 (No regrets) I dislike the American military greatly. They waste money throwing "freedom" where it isn't wanted. Members are not heroes. Unless you were drafted, you took the job and knew the risks, just as you would to be a teacher or a Wal-Mart cashier. You're free to disagree, but that's my opinion. Though, I have a soft spot for families that are reunited. I don't know if it's the feeling being shared with the people in the video or if it's the fact that I know they don't know If they'll ever see their soldier alive again or what, but I cry every time. 




 "Brothers". 




 I'm an amateur lesbian, not a professional or anything, but if you put a pussy in my pussy I'd probably cry. 




 Yo dawg, we heard you like pussy so we put pussy in your pussy so you can pet your pussy while you pet your pussy. 




 Ignore that. I'm an illiterate asshole. You don't need to apologize for the behavior of others. Keep doing you and making the male population look good! 




 Well, many if not most cishet men are sexist. They also are terribly objectifying. I don't want to deal with either. No, you can't watch, no I'm not thinking about experimenting. 

My best friend is a straight guy, but he's trans and doesn't do that stuff. I have several straight male friends but really I'd rather hang with girls who want to chat and talk girl stuff. Also, there is weird competitive energy between dudes and lesbians. 




 I figured out the problem! You can't read! 

P.s. the kid is a daughter. I bet it matters less now. 




 Talk of rabbit consumption isn't allowed here. 




 I didn't say that OP shouldn't be allowed in the child's life, I said she made a decision for her child.  




 Muh men's rights!!1!!11! 

He was a fifteen year old KID. He was in no position to be a dad or provide for a child. She tried to make the best choice for her kid's life. It wasn't to hurt OP. You guys try to force fifteen year old girls to abort. 




 I seriously doubt she had the means to contact him and ***had not really had a chance to decide what to do when she later ran into him.*** 




 Most likely they didn't exchange last names, numbers, Facebooks or Twitters. 




 First off, warts are hardly life or health threatening. It's not like he hid AIDS from you. 

We don't know if he would have done the same if it were a dangerous STI. We don't have a way to know that. Perhaps you could communicate about it. 

I don't think something like this is worth a break up. You have a right to be upset but I don't think your guy was being malicious at all. I think he was just being stupid and didn't think through the consequences of you getting it, too, since no one else had. 




 He was a 15 year old kid who had met her once. I seriously doubt she had the means to contact him and had not really had a chance to decide what to do when she later ran into him. 




 DD is rarely considered big. It's only 4 inches of boob total, so more like two each. 




 If you can admit you have a problem, get help. You can do it.  




 Check out /r/abrathatfits. It won't help you get a girl but a lot of dudes who need the support are going for bras. Maybe you can make a man bra, call it a "bro" put dragons on it, sell it to other perky breasted men, make the big bucks and get a girl that way. 




 I absolutely love muffin tops. Don't be like the cake boss with a cupcake top all up in there but a cute little muffin top really gets me. I'm totally unattracted to people without it. There is hope for you out there! 




 Wow. That's like outright stating no one poor or disabled can be prom king or queen. 




 At my school, popular kids are always nominated and recognized as such, but the kids who did the most work and were dedicated always got elected. 




 I have a preference (Kotex U super for tampons and Equate overnight ultrathin with wings for pads) but when I'm broke it's not a big deal to get something else. 




 But gay marriage is all about gay men and their scary buttsex. I mean really. They do blowjobs. Beardy blow jobs. And they do rimming. Sexy, bearded rimming. 

/^ homophobic politician thoughts. 




 I'm a fifth generation East Stroudsburg graduate, so I may be a bit biased here, but while Stroudsburg isn't a bad district the way other local ones are, they are going through some bad financial stuff and closing schools. They also have a strict dress code if that matters to you. East Stroudsburg South high is a US News ranked school and the dress code is no jeans or sweats, shirts must be school or college related or collared.  




 I don't know... It sticks our from the body, maybe it could get cold like hands and feet often do. 




 What if it's on your mons? 




 The only song post Folie a Deux is Young Volcanos and it doesn't even sound like them. 




 Since gay marriage devalues marriage, more women will be unmarried. Unmarried women have more abortions than married women. 

Though, you actually have to buy into the idea that same sex marriage devalues marriage as a whole. Makes sense, huh? 




 Oh god that sounds awful lol. I prefer glass and the harder the better so that sounds boring and I also like cold toys, not warm. 




 The goal isn't to orgasm as quickly as possible. The goal is to have fun.

Especially true on the bus. 




 Not a virgin but a lesbian; how does dick feel compared to dildos? 




 Go for stroudsburg or east stroudsburg. Better schools and civilization. They call pleasant valley high school pregnant valley for a reason. West is outright ghetto and Pocono mountain east is just high class ghetto.  




 /r/randomactsofpizza /r/assistance should be able to hook you up with some food. 




 Protip: cut onions in the kitchen, not on the Reddit. 




 From experience, marriage doesn't fix the problem. You have to know that it's not going to get better just because you said "I do." Work on your relationship. If you love her, it's worth fixing. Don't be afraid to try counselling.  




 I don't know if you guys are at a level for marriage talk, but something that has helped open My wife's eyes is to point out that, in wedding vows, you say "to have and to hold" which means "I promise you sex and cuddles". I give her as much of the hold part as she wants, so she needs to do some of the have part. 

Also, you need to find out why she hates going down on you. If it's uncomfortable, consider getting throat numbing spray. If it's a trigger to a past abuse, find out how to get around that trigger. It's her fault she isn't keeping up her end of the relationship, but it's a partnership and if you help her it'll be easier. 

I know you aren't quite to that point yet, but check out /r/deadbedrooms. It helped me a lot in figuring out how to deal with this. Some people there like myself are trying to prevent a dead bedroom, others have been in one for ten or more years. 

I wish you luck in talking to your girlfriend and don't ever feel guilty for wanting to have sex with her. You love her and that's a great way to show it, but also don't intentionally make her feel guilty for not wanting to, it's her body and she gets to make the decisions on what she does with it. 




 We communicate on it regularly. She has extremely low libido and doesn't like to be pressured at all. We have talked outside the bedroom about the issue and I have given up on trying to initiate. When I do, she cries and then I have to comfort her and then we go to sleep. I love her, don't get me wrong, but if I had known this would happen at 6 months in, I would have either addressed the issue or gotten out. 




 I'm not trying to judge you, but you said that in two other relationships you miscarried. That means this is the third relationship you are trying to have a baby in. You referred to your SO as your girlfriend, not wife or partner or fiance. Before you do this, please make sure you are certain about this relationship. Its not fair to the kid If you aren't. 




 Been with my wife 4.5 years, married 4.5 months. In my experience, it won't change. I love going down on her but she does it for me maybe half as much and almost never gets me off that way. Before we got married, we had sex about twice a week, sometimes more, and after we got married, we had sex like 15 times the first week and now we haven't had sex in two and a half weeks. Prior to this it was about every other week but apparently is become even less often. 




 What I'm saying is that you can still get pregnant from anal. It does mean condoms if you don't want babies. 




 Everything is really close and drippy.  




 My wife and I are married. We both are working on getting our degrees. She works full time and I'm taking time off to cope with my depression. I graduated high school a year early. I worked for a year and a half as a companion to a man with Down syndrome. I take care of my physically disabled mother. 

Four days ago, my wife's sister had a son. She is 19, doesn't work, doesn't go to school, has no life plans and has cut the baby's father out of his child's life. She lives with her father because he will pay for everything since it's a boy. 

I want a baby more than anything. So does my wife. We don't get to have one because we aren't "stable" enough but this stupid kid and plenty of other stupid kids do. Its bullshit. 




 But it should be. Where my SimCity3000 Unlimited trolls at?!


 




 More so having the wrong kind if friends. 




 If you rented the place with a washer and it no longer has one, you pay less in rent. Call the landlord and find out if he agrees that 50 or 100 a month less is fair. The washer will be replaced by Tuesday.

 I've tried to look at stuff about quantum physics and string theory and whatnot and it all gets mixed up in my head and I have to read it at like a first grade level. I'm not really good at science type stuff.

Gilded. 

 




 This is a part of it, too!

 Talk about a baby boom. 




 Maybe in Finland shelters only have mutts but plenty of American shelters have more pure bred dogs. The three shelters nearest me have about 80% pit bulls, 10% other pure and 10% mutts. If your theory were true, fewer shelters would be needed because more people would want the mutts.  




 Most divorces are not first marriages. Your stat on women initiating makes me think you have personal trust issues. I hope you can sort it out.  




 One generation of inbreeding does not equal many generations of inbreeding. Most people also don't just pick up a mutt from a random farm.  




 I take some comfort in "knowing" that somewhere, sometime, I'm still with My grandmother. I also think that everything happens simultaneously and repeats simultaneously. 




 I'm assuming that your concern with fairness is same sex marriage. I'm a married gay person, in part because my wife's family wouldn't let me see her or make decisions if she were hospitalized. Consider that if your girlfriend is your son's other "parent", marriage may help in a lot of ways legally. Just make sure your protect your family. 




 Lol totes fuck poor people! 




 Nope but plenty of racism from you. 




 I know you tagged /s but there are a lot of reasons this is an awful idea. 

For one, I know I have gotten up to get a drink and left my player fishing or whatever. Secondly, I like to play with my shirt off sometimes. I'm female. I don't want this being viewed. Third, not everyone has a webcam. Fourth, they would lose a lot of players who refuse to allow that sort of spying.  




 Guys, don't just downvote, explain why he's wrong.

That is extremely unlikely to the point of being almost impossible. Selective breeding is often inbreeding. This passes recessive traits along instead of letting dominant, better traits show. It is extremely unlikely that very many recessive will show. Do a little research on genetics.

There is a timeline somewhere in which my cousin wasn't killed in a drunk driving accident because she made a decision not to get in the car. There is a timeline somewhere in which I got sprite instead of lemonade at Wendy's and it took less time so my car got hit on the way out. 

More tinfoil-ish; everyone but me is a robot and I am the only remaining human. 




 Woah woah woah. Let's not get carried away. Manual as an option. 




 Damn... Well I hope it was worth the buy for you anyway! 




 Serious question; are you a lesbian? If so, is it really worth the buy? 




 I have camped my whole life, though we had a pop up when I was a kid. It didn't have a bathroom or a kitchen big enough to actually use, though, so it wasn't a big step up. My wife and I are looking forward to camping this summer and we have a tent. It's just the two of us and perhaps guests periodically. We live in the Poconos and will be camping in local Outdoor World campgrounds with full facilities for bathrooms and showers. What should I know about tent camping? 









 I don't think you have a very good understanding of how elections work. No, the only two choices aren't great. However, it's pretty useless to invite the one who will do the most bad to sit down to dinner by default. I'm a liberal and a married gay woman. If we get the wrong republican in office in 2016, I run the risk of my marriage being called invalid and having businesses be legally permitted to
 discriminate against me. We all run the risk of bathroom bans for trans people, no more healthcare for everyone, and supreme court judges being appointed that will ensure that that remains for a long time. By voting for a third party you are basically saying "eh, fuck it. Who cares what happens to the country?" you aren't actually taking a stance, you are simply throwing a fit and not contributing.  




 Except by voting third party, you take a bit from a candidate with actual potential to win and do good and throw it in the dirt. 




 This is a reaction to have if OP asks and she says no. To start here is a bit counterintuitive. You aren't totally wrong, just a little trigger happy.

 Not my opinion, just the reason. Cis people are *real* men or women and just man or woman is enough, since trans people are fake versions. 




 Having babies doesn't stretch a woman out, yo. 




 She was a bit too abrasive about it. Her intention was probably not to hurt you just more to say that she doesn't want to be badgered not to after her sister just badgered her into it. 




 You are a bit wrong. If we assume mom is heterozygous A, meaning genotype AO and dad is heterozygous B, meaning genotype BO, then kids can be AO, meaning type A, BO, meaning type B, AB, meaning type AB, or OO, meaning type O. A and B are codominant. If you have both, both will present. O is recessive. If you have one O and one of either A or B, the other will present. If you have two Os, you will be O. Understand or should I clarify? 




 I just talked to my wife about this and we are both in agreement that it's not really OPs choice here at all. 




 In an experiment with fruit flies, a previous partner's sperm could alter the genetics of a child. TweRPs believe people are equal to fruit flies. It's bad anatomy. 




 /u/miss_clarity was really just being nice and trying to offer more info to OP. She didn't come flipping out that he was a dick for not using that phrase. Not everyone needs to be politically incorrect all the time, either. 




 I'm 20. I have twin 15 year old sister in laws. They are the age I was when I lost my virginity to their sister. It's horrifying to me that they could be having sex. They're still little kids. 




 Being an SJW is nothing to be ashamed of, despite Reddit making it a dirty word.  




 Mensrights would be for me.  




 There really isn't, though. With the blessing you may defy his wishes anyway, but you are still asking if it's okay by him, when really it only matters if it's okay with the woman you are intending to marry. 




 My brother and I would "save our farts up" for until we could fart in the bath or pool and make bubbles. Obviously it didn't work. We would also pick each other's noses and feed it to each other and we would put our cheeks together and wiggle our tongues, basically making out without touching tongues or lips. 




 Well to be fair that tradition kind of says that the woman is "owned" by her father and, if he agrees to it, then "owned" by her husband. Literally all that's missing is a thousand bucks and a goat for the trade. 




 "M-marriage, sir?" 




 My mother in law was pregnant with triplet girls and one of them was miscarried. During the c section she had her tubes tied. 15 months later she gave birth to another girl. 




 You're not supposed to think anything. The person I initially replied to was asking for stories of weird coincidence surrounding miscarriage. I provided that. 




 No, it doesn't. The baby had no heartbeat. It died. 




 The baby didn't have a heartbeat. The baby died. 




 Oct/Nov 2007 - Brother and sister in law get pregnant.

Nov 4 2007 - cousin dies

Nov funeral - b and sil tell family privately that they are pregnant

Mid Nov - baby dies; no heartbeat, sil has fetus removed medically.

Feb 2008 - sil gets pregnant again

Nov 4 2008 - nephew is born 




 I live in the Poconos. It's red neck central up here. 




 The first baby died really early on. It was extremely traumatic for my sister in law. She had to have a D E (basically an abortion since the baby wasn't viable) and was really torn up about it. 




 My cousin died on November 4, 2007. At her funeral, my brother and sister in law told us that they were pregnant. The baby didn't have a heartbeat when they went for the appointment. On November 4, 2008, they had their son.

Edit: since reddittors can't read, having no heartbeat means the baby died. 




 I speculate that people don't recognize until that point. My mom has it and has had symptoms since childhood, including visible ones like dark skin, and it wasn't picked up on until her brother started having issues when she was in her thirties. Since my mom has it, noticing it for me was much easier. I started having trouble with iron when I was 17. It's possible that my experience is just extremely rare, but I think more research needs to be done. 




 I buy men's. I'm nonbinary and if I want to pack they provide the space but once I got used to wearing them I don't even notice that there is so much extra. 




 Boxer briefs from Aeropostale are my go to. So comfy and they fit me well. 




 I know a lot of you don't share underwear but my wife and I do. It just makes times like this one easier. Typically she runs out first and uses mine. However, I stupidly procrastinated forever on laundry and these suck. Whenever I do this, I remember why I switched in the first place. 




 It relates to red blood cells which women have less of naturally and they lose some more with menstruation. Just a quick Google search for that, though. Men are also more likely to have hemochromotosis than women. 




 You realize that, from the title, we can only really infer that OP had sex twice in ten months, right? If that's a lot to you, go to /r/deadbedrooms. 




 I had '89 740GL that I paid 275 for in 2013 last me six months and then a '97 850 cost 800 that ran great until it got hit last month and was totalled. I love Volvos. 




 They also let your child stay with you. 




 One person can love a nonbiological child, the other can't. It's not really that complicated. 




 It's not cheap for lesbians. It can take multiple cycles and sperm isn't exactly cheap either. There are better success rates if you have a doctor inseminate and better yet with ivf, all of which costs money. Someone else's struggle isn't any less real because yours is worse. 




 No, it's not. Not everyone has the capacity to love an adopted child the same way. It's better if those people are honest and don't adopt. 




 Not dead, but sick.

My grandfather was an alcoholic so my mom has avoided drinking for her whole life. In my 20 years I have seen her drink three times, each time was one glass at a wedding. On Valentine's Day she was diagnosed with cirrhosis. 




 We love you, too, ANUS_POKER. 




 A lot of people don't know the difference between the two terms. Most people who say conception is the start of life mean that fertilization is. 




 Fertilization - sperm enters egg.

Conception - fertilized egg attaches to uterine lining. 




 I hate getting in but then I hate to get out.  




 That's a bit different; you initially left out the ADD. 




 Kit Kat bar! 




 I took care of us and she took care of the chores.

I'm going to just let you think about that statement.
 




 Even if not exact it should be similar. Thanks for sharing! 




 Huh. I saw a chiropractor for six months and am still in pain since they are huge. I need to get this shit written down. 




 So you're one of those "I make more money and change the oil so you can do the lowly chores that I deem myself too good for" types. 




 The point is that, as a member of the household/family unit, he should do it on his own and not need coaching like a child. 
























 Is it a pocket door that slides into the wall? I have the same lock on a door like that in my bathroom. 




 And that reason was...? 




 Now who is reading too much into something? All I stated was that there a different cultural norms for military people and antimilitary people and between straight people and gay people, for gay people who are involved in gay culture. I never called you violent. You seem to have your jimmies rustled about this. I'll let you go, but maybe chill out and bother to read.

Edit: if you're offended that I saw your post history, stop commenting completely. Its public. 




 A quick glance through your history shows that you are a straight Navy wife. I'm an anti-military lesbian. Totally different cultural norms there. 

I'm saying that I feel downtowns were justified for unnecessary violent feelings. I also feel that you aren't the Reddit police and people are free to downvote even if you disagree with them. 




 That user implied that it was problematic. A lot of users here left twox in favor of this sub as well. 




 I personally think it's rude and wrong to desire to burn the faces of people who are concerned for you, but I guess cultural differences and all that. 




 He's being downvoted for desiring violence over someone showing concern. 




 Well it's bullshit to compare sister people, so yeah. 




 But social media like Reddit is different? 




 Blowjobs. 




 What if I told you adults can feel guilty about their choices? 




 I got you. I also can't stand Josh from work. He's just awful. 









 A mother? A sister? A friend? I have asked my dad, brother, and male friends to help in menstruation situations before. 




 I love U by Kotex. Periods suck. At least with their line I get pretty packaging and products and it really helps destigmatize something that shouldn't be stigmatized at all. It's surprisingly less embarrassing to whip out a bright purple tampon package than the awkward white one's of other brands. 




 I'm not trying to hurt feelings, but if saying "present" or "here" first really scares you, please see a doctor. It could be anxiety or even hypoglycemia. Your body does weird things and that's a bit excessive. Please seek help. 




 It actually just takes a quick trip to the SSA nearest you and then wait for your licence for when It gets renewed.  




 I hate hyphenated names but don't care if a man takes his lady's name. I just find it unnecessarily long winded and more difficult to spell. Also, if it becomes like a family thing to hyphenate then you have great grand children with like 50 letters in their last name. Try writing that at age 5! That's why my wife and I didn't hyphenate but it doesn't really affect me if other people do. 

Edit: when we went for our marriage licence it was also explained to us that getting Social Security when you are old can be difficult with a hyphen and that paperwork gets weird. They suggested that we either pick one name or each keep our own. 




 When my wife and I got married her mom flipped shit that she wasn't hyphenating. You can't please anyone. 




 It was just a joke. There are only two or three instances of males with Down syndrome fathering children in recorded history.

 I got banned from feminism for no reason. They wouldn't even tell me why. I'm actually a feminist. 




 I'm not stigmatizing adoption. I have two adopted siblings and will soon be an adopted parent. Young children understand that sometimes parents stretch the truth and tell lies to make people feel good. If one of their siblings is given away, they will certainly fear it for themselves and it will cause a powerful distrust of their parents. The other child will also have self esteem issues once they find out. 




 Dude. How would he explain adoption to his kids? Mommy gets huge but this baby isn't worth keeping? It would scare them into thinking they were next. When the kid grew up and all but inevitably found out, they'd also be fucked up that they, the third kid of happily married parents, wasn't worth keeping. That's really not a workable option. 




 Don't come up these stairs! I wish I had a step right here right now I'd step all over it! 




 I have a 20 year old self. It's also trash and toys  




 So we should also lock children up? They flail and could hurt someone, especially another kid or a baby. Most mentally ill people are not and do not need to be hospitalized. Do some research and have some compassion. 




 Not conforming to them doesn't mean they don't exist. I don't conform to American military worship, that doesn't make me not an American. 




 If you haven't used it, maybe you guys could trade! 




 You can't really not believe in them. It's not Santa; your belief isn't required. A telephone pole is also a societal construct but it's still real. Same goes for traffic laws. Disliking it doesn't make it not exist. 




 So at least approximately 20+ years. Possibly longer as many Republicans and Democrats don't want Hillary and would fight her being on the currency, and she is the only person with potential to be a female president at this time. Why should a female have to do more than Benjamin Franklin or Alexander Hamilton to be on there? It hurts no one to switch it to her over Jackson. 




 Still a good excuse to eat ice cream and wine for every meal. 




 About the hair thing. I was never allowed to cut mine. I chopped almost all of it off at about 16 and had it buzzed by 18. Once it's off she can't do anything, and it's not like hair places card. Go to a Wal-Mart or something with a specific pic and specify that you do not want it feminized. 




 Soooooo many servers walk away as soon as the first extra is requested. I will send you on all 274626 trips I need if you can't wait half a second for me to finish talking. 




 Monica wasn't Bill's first time straying. I'm willing to bet it wasn't his last, either. 




 Though, in the 90s and even now, it wouldn't be acceptable politically. 




 Dollar coins are useless. No where to put them in a drawer and too easily confused with quarters. What you are saying is that women shouldn't be mainstream the same as men in regards to currency. Why can't or shouldn't we update the money to include other, female, historical figures? 




 I speculate that she doesn't care that he's a cheater. It's the modern world; divorce is okay. They have strength in each other politically though, and they both have their girlfriends on the side, so no one is upset, except Monica and whiny people.  














 "Because rich people have a drug problem; a cocaine problem. Poor people are lowly addicts; crackheads and tweakers." - my college sociology professor. 




 I'm a Social Work major. I was commenting on the typical Reddit circlejerk about STEM degrees. 




 There is a huge variety between penis and clitoral sizes. That doesn't change a persons sex or gender, that was my point. 

Why is consistency so important?  




 Why? They are there to see as well. They also are genetic females, not genetic women. Some people not passing doesn't mean that no people pass. Actually, a vast majority of transmen pass with ease. 




 The problem is that it isn't a STEM degree. Those are the only degrees worth getting, you know. 




 I should have said that your gender directly relates to your gender presentation, which is how you are viewed. Sex also isn't consistent. There are intersex people. Where is the line between macroclitoris and micropenis? No two vulvas look the same, so are not all vulvas female vulvas? 




 You can't use a unisex toilet? Are you sure you aren't the one with a disorder? 




 People without penises can use urinals. There are stand-to-pee devices and things like Go-Girls. Some vulva having people can also per standing and aim well, though that is rare. Women are allowed to see urinals as well. It isn't against the rules. 




 Do you tell strangers your blood type? Do you tell them that you are a carrier for Tay-Sachs or any other genetic disorder? No, you don't, and you don't have to announce your sex by walking into a gendered bathroom. 




 Gender is what other people see. It's how you are socially categorized. 




 So why do we have to remove the urinal? Women can see them you know. 




 No you treat them with hormones, just like you do transpeople. The only proven, effective treatment for transpeople is transition. 




 Not really. It's no one besides you, your partner, and your doctor's business what your sex is. It doesn't matter for your employer or for a bathroom. What matters there is your gender. Gender is hardwired into the brain and has nothing to do with stereotypes. Plenty of transpeople are gay and behave in a role closer to their assigned sex. Many cisgender people are butch lesbians or feminine gay men, but that has nothing to do with their gender. 




 Close. Gender roles are a social construct. Gender is hardwired into the brain. 




 An "SJW" degree is a degree in Social Work. It's a very marketable degree. 




 Sex is in your pants, orientation is in your heart, gender is in your head. 

 




 Yeah! Him and his personal vendetta against rain barrels! 




 Literally only useful for babies. Even if the baby isn't yours, it's content to sleep on them.  




 Doesn't help.  




 Vaginal. 




 They just shove their fingers in. It's deaf privilege. 




 Thanks for the assumption and shitty source! I've actually only had one partner and she's a woman. 




 To fertilize the egg the partner has to be recent, as in within the week. 




 Well. I think you need to go circlejerk back on TRP. 




 I have a younger brother. I am more than willing to share, but keep your damn hands off my food unless I okay it. I've recently observed that youngest children lack sharing issues like that but they also lack the respect of keeping their hands off other people's stuff. Obviously not all youngest children, but many in my experience. 




 What is your preference for yourself? Partners? Is it a deal breaker or are you flexible? Any particular reason? Awkward conversation stories? 




 She's also judgemental if it wasn't clear from this. She posts in FPH. 




 No death threats were made here. 




 I hang out with my mom a lot. It's good because I love being close to her, but it's hard. She's almost 60 and has a lot of medical problems. It means that my best friend is dying and it's terrifying. I also spend a lot of time with my wife.  




 Whynonynonym! 




 And she'll have a great physical memento of her youth! Pretty cool, huh? It's almost like no one gets sexier between 60 and 80! 




 One pic had them kissing. It's pretty easy to trip and fall onto that conclusion. No jumping required. 




 I'm sorry. I worded that poorly. I have two adopted brothers. I'm extremely grateful for biomoms who give up their kids so they can have a good life. I don't believe they are bad people or anything like that. I meant that, on a subconscious level, you may feel that she didn't love you and it may make it harder for you to trust her. Obviously she loved you or she wouldn't have had the courage to give you up to your family. 




 You trust your parents to love you no matter what. She already, to some degree on a subconscious level, betrayed that by giving you up and you don't have that trust. That's probably why you are scared. 

She wants to meet you. The real you. She has no rights to expectations on who or what you are. You want to meet the real her. For this relationship to work, you have to learn to appreciate one another, warts and all.  




 I don't even have a dick and that sounds great. 




 And literally anyone over age 7 can do it, physically speaking. A mother or father is no longer needed. 




 I can read music and I can read tab but I struggle to read chords and it would be much easier for me to be able to play from tab, but I can only really find chord charts online. Am I not going to the right places or is it not typically done to write ukulele tab?

 The store got the money to give them away from somewhere. That somewhere is other customer purchases.  




 That's exactly what happens! The samples are free to you because the other customers pay for it by buying from the company.  




 That's still free. He didn't pay for it; it was free to him. That's like saying free samples aren't free because the company paid for it.

 Disclaimer: this is my personal experience and it certainly varies by person and location.

The only reason a person who makes too much for SNAP to have an empty refrigerator is wasteful spending. My wife and I finally broke down and applied and were called that day because we qualified for expedited food stamps to the tune of 300 just for the two of us. We had no idea we were that poor. Prior to this, we were still eating every day. It was pasta and shitty sauce, but It was food. I do taxes for my family. Last year, my parents made 25,000. My mom hasn't applied for SNAP, though I can't figure out why, but no one goes hungry of them, my brother, his girlfriend, and what they do to supplement my wife and I now that we moved back in with them. It's about budgeting, which everyone has to do. When I was receiving SNAP, if we wanted to eat something besides pasta, we had to work to stretch that money. Yes, the day we got it, we had a full fridge, but the day before we had almost nothing.  




 I feel like Mux is awful. It's like muck and it makes me think of the phrase "[he] mucks everything up." That's just me, though, so if that's the word, that's the word. 




 Maybe God wanted them to wait longer and had them need to use IVF and it was God's will that IVF and the doctors existed all along.  




 Try to find an LCSW. (Licenced Clinical Social Worker) I believe in some places they can do both. Check for your area. 




 To be fair, the surgery and IVF aren't fool proof, they still fail. They are probably thanking God that it worked. 

Edit: I'm not saying they got pregnant because of God. I'm saying that people who thank God are thankful that He allowed the procedures to work. 




 The thing is, people aren't thanking God for swooping in and saving them. They are thanking God for putting the right people (you) in the right places at the right times and them saving them. They believe that God gave you the gifts of desire and ability to help them. The belief is not that you were there by your own volition, but by appointment from God. Helpers are viewed as special in the eye of God to people who thank God for things like this, surviving surgery, someone showing up to help change a flat, etc. It isn't meant as a slight against you. 




 Plot twist; the nanny is named Mary and her Nick name is now mama.

 You can't have open containers of alcohol in your vehicle. It's a danger to other people. Your friends broke the law, despite how you feel about that law, and they deserved to be punished. They knew the potential consequences.

 Not at all. People with AIDS are living full or near full life spans. We are just this side of a cure. A vast majority of people with it also try very hard not  to spread it around. They also don't die alone.

 Yeah, I don't want my mom or wife to have to identify me all fucked up. At least if I didn't skid the pavement with my face they don't have to see that. 




 Good on your for apologizing dude! 




 Plenty of women like anal though  




 Don't let it. It's a chance to grow and change. You never know, you could end up back together. My father in law remarried his second wife two years ago, after 12 years of divorce. My uncle left a horrible woman and his second wife is his soul mate. Try to be happy at changes. When they say days drag and years fly it's because the days are all the same. Let the change surround you and let it motivate you, if you can. Continue to seek support where you see fit. A divorce is a huge undertaking. Don't be afraid to talk about it. Best wishes.

 I doubt that. You still have to meet with caseworkers, you still have to have a place for people without online access. They help with translations, hold hearings for disputes on welfare and provide phones for calling caseworkers if you don't have one. I don't live in Maryland, but I doubt it's much different elsewhere.

 Yes and no. While HIV cannot kill you, when it turns to AIDS it can. However, we are no longer in the 1980s. People can go 20 or more years without HIV turning to AIDS. Even when it does change over, it is no longer the death sentence that it once was. It is fairly easily managed and medical researchers have managed to bring viral load levels down so low that it is nearly undetectable, effectively curing the virus, but with the stipulation that one must remain on antiretroviral medication for life. While AIDS was a deadly epidemic at one time, it is now closer to the flu; some people will die, but many more, with effective treatment, will be fine for a very long time. Since we don't arrest people for going out when sick and knowingly passing it along by touching things in public, it's a bit of a stretch to say that its attempted murder. More sensible would be a charge for fraud and a charge for assault, but that's just my opinion. 




 Yes and no. My "type" of lesbian is called boidyke. That means I'm a young, butch lesbian that isn't ultra masculine. Often, people like me wear the same clothes as men and boys a few years younger. Obviously, if stores took advantage of that, they'd lose a lot of sales to said boys. There are a handful of smaller name designers that focus on clothes for women who are masculine. I generally learn about them online. There are even maternity brands dedicated to masculine people. I belong to such a small demographic that for anything that is big name it isn't worth the money and potential loss to market to me. 




 SJW has two meanings. The real one; social workers. The stupid; anyone left of me. Neither is really an insult. 




 Also great to ensure safety of patients! Abortions can have unintended complications that require more than what is available outpatient. 

Edit: I'm not saying outpatient is bad, I'm saying that hospital procedures can be better. Diner food isn't bad, but restaurant food can be better; it's all about what you want. What I would want is the best safety net possible.

 I grew up poor and am minimally better off now. My one splurge is clothes. I'm a 20 year old lesbian, and I love the men's section at Aeropostale. The sales are great and the clothes last years longer than anything I've ever bought at Wal-Mart.  




 Equal parts redneck and historical society. 









 Old Spice sells it at Wal-Mart! 




 This is my mom! She told me and my then girlfriend, now wife, to "try the shoes on before you buy them."  




 /r/loomknitting 




 Knees are sooooo ugly. I hate knees more than any other body part.  




 More than disdain, people assume I'm incompetent simply because I appear female. 




 They why don't transmen get murdered at such high rates? 




 "Insecure bitches" 




 No one cares if a woman wear jeans because wanting to be a man isn't bad. Being a transwoman gets you murdered because wanting to be a woman is the worst thing someone can be.  




 A lot of feminists think feminism has to do with women being superior. 

FTFY.

Feminism is about equality, some assholes just forget that. 




 It's a women's issue that being seen as feminine is a bad thing. 




 I'm AFAB and genderqueer! I totally get people looking weird at me for doing man things with these big ass breasts. 




 So what you're saying is she is an irresponsible mover. 




 Shhh! They'll realize that they're all actually feminists and have to go get washed up over at /mensrights and TRP. 




 It's just hair. Its not like he's going to be using his DSL.

Edit: DSL is dick sucking lips. Not sure why the comment saying this was deleted. 




 Psoriasis. I have it on the back of my head and on my arms and legs. Its best in the summer, when Its often exposed. Some derms will send patients to tan. 




 Maybe your point would come across better if it was phrased in a less misogynistic way. 




 That's an adult thing, not a man thing, sadly. 




 People should have skills, not just men.  




 This thread is marked serious and assaulting ones spouse is never acceptable. If you wish to abuse your partner, seek help. 




 I don't know how much this actually works. I'm a woman, but a butch one. I'd never flirt with a cop as I don't feel it's appropriate and I'd be judged for the tears, too. I have never gotten a ticket in all the Times I've been pulled over. I'm polite and honest. I think I get away with it by being white. I had a Spanish friend who is a lot like me and she would always get tickets. I live in a red neck area, though, with tons of racists. 




 I doubt he will. I'm his gay sister and it's not really an issue in our family. If he were gay he'd have said so by now. 




 Sadly no. My older brothers are both in long term, committed relationships. 




 That's not acceptable for anyone and this post is tagged serious. 




 I'd divorce a spouse for a "sucks for you" comment paired with lack of equal dedication to our children. 




 I have no idea how you got Margaret. 




 My wife and I both have unconventional spellings for our first and last names, and my middle name. I have never minded spelling it all out. It's unique and I love it, and so does she. 




 Eh I think it looks better with one. 




 If I had a spouse like you I'd get a divorce yesterday. 




 My brother and his girlfriend go for mani/pedi fates every other Saturday. He gets a clear coat. He's a 19 year old musclehead/car nut. There are guys out there! 









 My 6 year old nephew loves Legos. For Easter, I got him a set that was just pieces. He had no idea what the fuck to do. The only sets kids want and people buy are the pre planned one's. How about some imagination? 




 My mom told me that it meant you weren't a virgin and refused. I had been having sex with My girlfriend for months by then. I wasn't concerned. 




 I honestly love them. Pads feel like a diaper to me. Tampons keep me feeling cleaner and keep odor in. I don't even feel them, which you aren't supposed to if done right. But to each their own. Tons of people love menstrual cups and they are scary as fuck to me. 




 Surprisingly this often exactly what happens. I live in the Poconos. I am three exits on 80 in from Jersey and about 80 miles west of NYC. My family is local; I'm a sixth documented generation graduate of my high school. People who come here from New York and New Jersey bring gang violence, drugs, entitled attitudes, littering, and more with them. That isn't to say that all people from those places do that or even all that come here do, but plenty of them do bring all of that here, and it sucks for those of us who are local and don't want those things here. 




 I literally have to hold back my orgasms of excitement while I am passing clots the size of pennies through my cervix. 




 Well you put tampons in your vagina so it must feel great! Like a cottony dildo! 




 I'd bet a thousand to one that OPs desk was either moved or his position changed. It's unsanitary to PUMP in a bathroom and it's wrong to force a woman to expose herself. 




 Because people are not obligated to show any part of their body to anyone else. 




 If you have Netflix, try The Secret Life of the American Teenager and One Tree Hill. 




 Why should they have to expose their breasts to their coworkers? 




 So jerk it at home on your own time. 




 I'm from the northeast! 




 But dem titties is there for meeeeeee!

^^^^^/s 









 Do you understand lactation and breasts being engorged? It's completely different from wanting to jerk it. 




 You're saying it's logical to allow employees to use their time to masturbate, which is technically illegal in public, but not smoke, which is legal? 

Edit: I just realized you were explaining his thinking. I'm sorry. 




 Anecdote: I was raised in the north and I use holler/hollered

 




 I understand where you could come to that conclusion, but I disagree. Even though we have walls in the women's room, it's awkward to intentionally take the stall next to someone if there are other choices. Its just awkward to use the bathroom so close to other people, especially strangers. 




 She could be, but that's not a valid reason to beat someone. 




 She already gave him the ultimatum "you hit me again and I leave". If she doesn't follow through on that he has no reason to think she will again. Also, is it really worth putting her life at risk to stop an abusive person from being an addict? 




 That's irrelevant. The situation at hand is a man beating a woman for the second time in a week and his mother blaming the woman. Your comment is irrelevant. 




 How do you prepare it? 




 Can confirm; my wife is the boss. 




 Clothes from Aeropostale. Their sales are great and it's generally good stuff on sale. I only shop sale racks in that store. 




 Most drag queens are not transvestites, either. 




 You come to a sub that thrives on equality and make a homophobic joke and expected it to go well. That's irrational. 




 I'm a genderqueer lesbian. Don't throw your anger at me over your inability to behave like a rational human. 




 There are plenty of gay drag queens, which actually vary from transvestites. Also, you implied that drag queens are gay by implying that they like pegging that you implied is gay.  




 How is it a bunch of songs stitched together? It has a story progression done in a series of different pieces. Plenty of songs are done this way; Paradise by the Dashboard Light, Jesus of Suburbia, Alice's Restaurant, and more. 




 Came here to say this. 




 On a scale of 10 to 10, 11/10 with 12/10 with rice. 




 I guess I have to see it a fourth time. 




 Nope. I don't like action movies.  




 Jessica! 




 Wait the what? 




 That was easily my favorite scene in the movie! The singing and dancing were really impressive. 




 We don't use "retarded" anymore. A person is "developmentally delayed".  




 Most siblings do not look that much alike. My sisters in law have another sister 15 months younger than them that looks nothing like them. Looking at pictures of siblings at the same age rarely offers the kind of similarity of many fraternal twins. 




 No, those are identical twins, not fraternal. 




 Like Mary Kate and Ashley or young Dylan and Cole Sprouse. I have fraternal twin sister in laws that I can't tell apart either. Why does this happen? 




 You should go see it. It took my wife months to get me to watch the first and I was actually excited for the second. It was really a good movie. 




 It's a great movie! My wife and I went on a date to see it, then the next night we saw it with my brother and his girlfriend. Yesterday we saw it with my sisters in law on my wife's side. 









 Try posting in /r/asktransgender. This is more of a general trans topic so they may be able to help more. 




 I hate /legaladvice. Real lawyers are not hanging out giving away free info on reddit. It's people who can use Google just like you. See if you can get a court appointed attorney. Maybe try to get your daughter into a mental health rehab center if she is suicidal and see if that helps. It may even help your case. I'm not well versed on the legal stuff, but I'm a mental health advocate. Please get your daughter help. 




 So if you need to eat a standard wooden door. 




 Hey no problem. If you don't live it sometimes it's hard to see a different side or there are perspectives you don't consider. Just like how sometimes fast food may be a part of your health budget though a splurge, that's what fresh food often is to me, just with a financial splurge. 




 I disagree. I'm poor and not healthy. I would love to be able to eat more fresh veggies and fruit. My favorite food is asparagus. Its too damn expensive. If it were cheaper, I'd have it more often. 




 I hate refrigerated leftovers! Room temp is where it's at and I haven't died yet. 




 one time we were in a diner and my uncle showed up. my dad had to leave to take my mom to work (night shift) and he offered me and my brother milkshakes. we said that we didn't think our parents would be okay with that. he said your parents aren't here, pick a flavor. his example is how I try to live my life as an aunt. 




 /r/firstworldchildmurdererproblems 




 Is it just biological middle children? I am a middle child but my older siblings are adopted. 




 pro tip: she's not going to ask about boys or drinks or birth control or thongs. she's just going to do all of that. your behavior makes you unapproachable and you are destroying your relationship with your daughter by being a controlling misogynist. 




 I'm anti-two piece for girls prior to high school. I have seen too many times men leering at little girls. I feel that two piece suits sexualize them and their bodies when they are too young to know what that means. I am also against Speedo style suits for little boys for the same reason. Children should not be sexualized. Tankini style suits are okay as long as the bottom is shorts style, not like a bikin, in my opinion for my children. 




 I assume you've heard of phantom limb syndrome, where amputees can still "feel" their body parts. For me, dysphoria is a lot like that. I can feel that my chest is supposed to be flat. I can feel myself get erections and I can feel that I should have testes. I have, on more than one occasion, gone out into my house where four other people live shirtless because I seriously forget that I have female breasts that can't just be waving around in front of my father.  




 except I'm attracted to women, not men, so no, not really. 




 If you shave no where, why care? For me personally, if you're femme enough to  want to wear a bikini bottom but not shave, I'm not approaching you. If I'm looking for a femme girl who fits femme stereotypes, I want shaved pits and legs and trimmed pubes. In the end, it's your body and your choice on what you do, I just wouldn't be attracted to you, but you're looking to be happy, not make me happy, so you do you. 




 The picture was of a cat with a deformed facial bone. I can't remember the exact name of it. It was simply referred to as having DS because it supposedly looked like a person with DS. He is just a moron and didn't think or search anything before posting. 




 This was really sweet. 




 That's what I thought this amounted to, but now he and his other friends are trying to throw opinions at me to prove me wrong. It's just stupid. It should have never been posted. What got me was that he had the balls to tag me in it. 




 I love hugs *hugs back probably too enthusiastically*!

I don't think it makes me special; I just have a passion and I firmly believe that people should follow their passion, especially if it helps others. 









 Also, not being a creepy weirdo makes people like you more. 




 In front of a room of 300 people minimum she should have embarrassed and made an ass out of OP? Yeah right. She's a 17/18 year old girl who was put on the spot. 




 It was probably more like "I'm going to get us a room for after the after party so we can keep hanging out, okay?" and less like "would you be comfortable with me getting us a room so we can continue hanging out after the after party if we want to?" 




 That's why I father them and let their mothers handle it. 




 I wear baggy shorts. My wife shoves her hand up my pant leg any chance she gets. While I'm driving. At the movies. Sitting side by side in a restaurant. 




 I'm a genderqueer, butch hair-shy-of-pillow-princess married to a very sexy, femme top. Its great. 




 I'm a bit younger than you, but I'm married and live with my parents. 

It helps me to realize that a lot of people have no choice right now; wages are too low and prices are too high. My wife and I have a tiny cramped bedroom, but we are together and we help my mom out. I'm also unemployed. My mom is physically disabled and I do a lot that she can't. Maybe something to help you feel you have purpose is to take over household responsibility a little at a time. 

I don't know if this helps at all but I hope so. Best wishes. 




 Boys do this stuff too you know. 




 I currently have what I call a dirtbag sim in Sims 3 that has 20 children, two more women pregnant, and will likely have some more in his 6 days before becoming an elder. Notable conquests include kids with a woman and then kids with her daughter and two sisters getting pregnant in the same day. He only raises the boys, and just takes them from their mothers. The oldest son is likely to follow suit. Anyone else have similar tales? 




 Except woman? Women don't want to be objectified with words like "chicks" or "honeys". Just call us women or our names. Not "females" or "chicas" or anything else creepy and dehumanizing. 




 This counselor ticks all my boxes, but I'm wondering if the other person is a conflict of some sort? I like her and I like my former boss, and my quitting had nothing to do with him and he and I are still friendly. I just want to know If it's an ethical issue.

Can I go in to make my appointment or should I call? I really hate phones. 




 Whip It! I love that movie so much. The book is great too. 




 Manipulating someone's emotions =/= being pretty. 




 That makes much more sense! I had conjured up a situation of an acquaintance you had had one date with getting his dick and legal name and tag all over Twitter. That's much more reasonable. 




 I upvoted you, but how would you feel if, as an attempted turn on, you sent him surprise boob pics for them to end up public attached to you for life like that? 




 I saw it two nights in a row. So worth it. 




 That's not always possible. Sometimes, like right now, I need more, so my wife has to give more. Right now I'm probably giving 40 to her 90, but in the past I've given a lot more. Marriage is leaning on one another when you need to. 




 You're one of those people who only interacts over the internet, right? 




 My uncle gave my mom away. Her dad was an abusive deadbeat and, while he was present, her older brother gave her away.  




 Well I'm glad you get that perk lol.  




 I have a lot of road blocks keeping me from transitioning. However, a ton of my dysphoria disappeared about a month ago when I saw a boy in the mirror. That boy looks 12 compared to my biological 20, but I'm happy with him. I don't know if I'm just carrying myself differently or what, but hormone free that boy is there smiling at me every morning and I'm thrilled. 




 Wait. Estrogen infused pubic hair is supposed to be soft and curly? I'm AFAB and mine is straight and wiry. So is my wife's. I'm not on hormones but she has PCOS and high T naturally so that would make sense for her. Why don't I get this perk? 









 What makes your opinion right and mine wrong? Because it's your opinion? 




 I agree that it's stupid, which is why the friendzone is stupid! 

Now that you are so personally offended that you result to name calling... 




 Exactly! It's no where near perfect or what we need, but when you are starving, you'll take shitty food to hold you over until good food becomes available. You won't just hope until you die. 




 Nice meme.

Maybe you spent a lot of time on reddit and that's why you think that's the context it's usually used in.

The friendzone = "I deserve sex" trope is fucking stupid. It's not what it means; you're misrepresenting the usage of the phrase. 

That reads passion. 









 You seem really passionate about this. Don't like someone blowing up your spot? 




 Not really. It's a neckbeardy thing to say. It means "I was nice! I deserve sex! Why the friendzone!?" 




 Yes, they do.  




 I'm gay. What pisses me off more than religious people who are against same sex marriage are ultra liberal hipsters who are against "all marriage" and therefore vote against it. Just because you don't want it doesn't mean I don't.  




 It's a transitional measure, like Don't Ask Don't Tell. No one really likes it, buts it's the only real step in normalizing to get it in it's feet. We will have single payer healthcare eventually, but if we had tried it immediately, it would have been shut down. We now have gay people serving openly, but if we hadn't had DADT, it would have been a longer wait. 




 The idea of the friendzone blames the woman for not wanting to be with you. It makes her out to be bad for not wanting it, and that's wrong. 




 No. When minimum wage is increased, every wage is. Just like minimum wage doesn't jump 4 dollars overnight, higher level wages will take time. Though, when you will be able to survive on flipping burgers, that makes good employees harder to keep. They have other real options. Employers need to be offering the best options to ensure that they keep the ones they want to. Higher minimum wage is good for all people, not just poor people. 
























 I'd say you're wrong. 




 ~~Not when followed by "lite". Ultra thin pads are also thinner than regular pads.~~

 Yeaaaah... need to ~~shorten my showers though...~~ start showering at other people's showers; water bill is too high...

 Male - sex woman - gender  




 Thank you! Back at you! 




 Your second analogy is actually great. Questioning can feel a lot like not knowing who you are and being wrong about it. That's why, when a person finally comes to a real conclusion, it's better safe than sorry. They won't be offended by you trying to hard to accept them, but may be hurt by you seemingly not trying have enough. 




 You're putting words in my mouth. That's not even close to what I said. She earned the medals while presenting as a man and being male. I don't know the rules for trans* Olympians, since I'm not the least bit interested in the Olympics. In my opinion, people should participate with the gender they present and/or identify as, regardless of sex, and if that changes in the future that has no bearing on the accomplishments, but I don't make the rules. 

Since you are clearly looking for a fight, please go TERF elsewhere. 




 That's so cool! I'm sorry all you got was a gator. Maybe you can try again in the future! 




 Incidentally, one can be male and a woman. 




 I have anxiety and just throw it on whenever I'm having an attack. Its soothing  




 I think she would have gotten less outrage if it weren't for her crimes. She was literally only known for violating the Espionage Act and nothing else. 




 Yep! She has always been a woman, just not out about such. That's the rule of thumb, anyhow. Individuals may have personal preferences but it's a fair, safe rule to follow. 




 You're the one being abusive here, hon. 




 And that is a struggle for a spouse of a transperson. But guess what? Transitioning is about the individual, not their spouse or us strangers. 




 True, but I've learned that six is waaaaaaay too many. 




 I'm 20. My current favorite is Hairspray. 




 Manatee! When I was in kindergarten my class "adopted" one and fundraised for it. 




 On my wife's 21st I had two glasses of wine and five pina coladas. I was smashed. She was still mostly sober so at midnight we made a Wawa run and I ended up throwing it all up. 




 It's okay! Thank you! 









 Yes! I was on mobile with next to no speed and Google wouldn't load the real name for it! 




 Shawn is unisex? That sounds about as unisex as Britni to me. 




 I, too, am an ordained Dudist Priest! 




 I basically use my face routine on my arms twice daily. I start with Equate-equivalent of Cetaphil cleanser. Then, I use Equate Black Head Eraser. Then I use wipes with salicylic acid that I purchased at the Dollar Tree. Finally, I moisturize with Equate-equivalent of Cetaphil moisturizer. In four days the redness has reduced significantly as has the bumpyness. I hope someone else can use this to help them! 




 I'm confused; what part are you sorry to hear? 




 Then don't go so slow in the left lane. 




 Thank you! We are very happy with our choice! 




 If your parents made you aware enough that you attended pride events, you have to decide to become a bigot. 




 Thank you! 




 In typical babydyke fashion, we talked about marriage from about 2 weeks in. It was always an inevitable. There was never a huge proposal in a super immediate way. On our nerd anniversary dating I gave her a ring in Texas Road house and asked her to marry me at some point. However, setting a date was done by us sitting in a college sociology class and me realizing that her father's income took her out of financial aid. I wrote her a note explaining such and we talked to my parents (who we live with) and got their okay. We talked to her mom the next day.  




 I drive a 2003 Hyundai Elantra that I paid for with my own money from an accident suit in my 1997 Volvo 850 that I paid for with my own money. My brother drives a 1998 Ford Mustang that my uncle hooked him up with cheap and helped with all the repairs.

My brother is constantly calling my car a go kart and just a general dick about how much better he is than me. It really hurts me and I really hate it. He is completely irrational and talking to him about t would do nothing.

TL;DR my brother is a dick. 




 Hahaha I sniff her armpits, too! I also pick at her pimples and stuff. She hates it lol but I love it.

We work really hard to support each other, and so far it seems to be working okay. 




 We are both gross and don't have fantastic hygiene; mostly it's a side effect of our depression.

She eats ranch dressing on peanut butter sandwiches. I find it horrifying. She is grossed out by my insistence on licking her face whenever possible. 




 We have been together since we were 15 and 16. That helped for most of our family members, and, she would have had to drop out of school because of financial aid, so her mom got over it really fast. 




 ...come to think of it, you probably have. 




 Cheap vibrators use AA or AAA. Good vibrators use either D or C batteries.  




 /u/MeridatheBearida is my wife and we would love to a answer any and all of your questions! Happy pride month! 




 Then let's stay fat! 




 You are a balterina! 




 I don't know if you mean it that way, but this seemed really misandrist to me. 




 And they can still attend pride rallies and church. Like 75% of Reddit went to church before becoming atheist. You can go to a pride parade and then decide to become a bigot, too. 




 I identify as gq and don't have PCOS. My wife has PCOS and is solidly a woman. I don't know that I believe there is a link. It seems as though he is implying that heightened testosterone levels make someone's gender identity wacky. It would stand to reason that going on T would alter identity as well. 




 Walls is my go to when I'm feeling down. Such a good song.

Those are my current top two but it fluctuates. 




 When you're in a position of underprivilege it's important to see more perspectives so you don't develop a victim complex. 




 So any actor making a racist joke must be a racist. Any actor who makes a joke about dead babies/abortion/stillbirth/miscarriage must be insensitive to women and loss of children. Any actor who makes a sexist joke is actually sexist. 

That's completely preposterous. Acting is not real.  




 I'm proud of you for making it through last night. That's a major accomplishment. I hope that you can continue to make it through every night until it's no longer a struggle.  




 Eh, it's called acting for a reason. That's like saying that agreeing to play a murderer means the actor perpetuates murder. 




 Oh! I see what you mean now; circlejerk upvotes of the same thing so the hive mind can get going. That is definitely really shitty and not something we want. I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.

 Sadly, the issue seems to be time and energy for OP, not money, but perhaps I'm wrong. 




 No, no! See it's a *health issue*. /s

 Yo. If you think all females the same and all Js different, you gotta straighten out some priorities.

Seriously though she hates it and makes me carry said over stuffed wallet. 




 I'm here for laughs. Other people's karma doesn't affect me; if they have high karma clearly they post good content. 




 And that's fine for them. Some of my trans friends truly identify as trans and like the label.  




 Well that's a trans pride symbol. Clearly your friend doesn't have trans pride and prefers to be seen as equal to a cis woman. That isn't a bad thing, but based on that this has little to do with her then. 




 Well creating them is sort of gross and shouldn't be shown to children, but growing them is fine!

 You da real MVP, OP. 




 I am a 20 year old woman. I last shaved my legs the night before my wedding, which was December 10th. I last saved my armpits roughly one month ago. I last shaved my pubic hair sometime in January, I think. 

I'm a small part Native American, and it presents in low body hair and reddish toned skin. My legs don't really appear hairy, as what there is is blonde and thin. My armpits have enough growth to feel the breeze from the fan if I'm shirtless. 

I absolutely love it. I feel sexy with more body hair. I feel more myself, not working so hard to remove what is naturally growing. I bathe regularly and wear deodorant, so smell isn't an issue. Not shaving makes me feel at home in my body. 

My wife loves that I'm more confident. She loves that I like my body more. She also knows that, if she asks, I will remove all of it for her. 

I wear shorts and don't care, though I don't quite have the confidence for tanks right now. 

My sisters in law are all 14 and 15. They are all super feminine and don't get why I'm comfortable this way. I don't need them to get it. I need me to be happy, and this helps me be happy. 




 36 of my deceased '89 Volvo 740. 




 You know what else was the best thing to happen to LGBT people? Stonewall! Sure, we we're murdered an assaulted but people knew!

Just like with AIDS! Formerly Gay Cancer, formerly GRID. We died and were treated unjustly and that bigotry prevails but people knew gays were real! 




 I disagree that the email and Skype are an issue. If you ever thought the companies didn't have records you're incredibly naive. I never really considered the medical stuff, but if it's attached through email, It's almost to be expected. 

I was unaware of the picture and phone sex stuff being circulated, but that's an issue of abuse of the system, not the system itself.

Thank you for making me more aware. :) 




 Except when you use the internet it's a public thing, not your bedroom.  




 I'd skip the pap and just get a massage. 









 My wife's engagement ring was 60 bucks and her wedding ring was under 30. We are happy and in love and the money spent on a ring is irrelevant.

 That's why I always dry myself on the floor. I don't want the floor to miss out on perianal sweat. 




 I think that would make getting raped a little worse, like you're laying there having just been raped which is really a shitty thing, and then you smell ice cream but there is none to be had, so you're just that much more upset that you can't even get some comfort food. 




 It seems like I went through webMD and picked symptoms. 

I have irrational, uncontrollable anger that I can't handle well in many situations. I'm very emotionally unstable; I can go from ecstatic to livid like the flip of a switch, and I handle neither particularly well. I have really bad abandonment issues for no apparent reason and it manifests in my testing relationships and generally being an asshole to make sure people don't abandon me. I nearly always feel empty; the only time I don't is during extremely special happy events and when I drink. I make a conscious effort to control my drinking and drink less than once a month, and I'm a lightweight so literally two Smirnoff ice and I'm drunk. I drive and spend rather recklessly and I find myself dissociating and unable to really change my off the wall actions. I also have a history with self harm.

I've read that BPD is often hard to diagnose because people with it don't want to be criticized so they won't mention shitty things they do. Because of that, I feel like a fraud, like if I really had it I couldn't be this self critical. I've had some of these symptoms for a long time, but stuff like the dissociating is very recent, like within the last year. The only stable relationships I have are with my wife and my mother. I go through "friends" like water and I admittedly am a terrible judge of character so I pick them poorly. 




 My mom is my best friend. She supports transpeople, just not me transitioning. She fostered over 50 children, partly because she was infertile. Almost all of those children were boys. She wanted a daughter so bad. When she got pregnant with me, she was 38. She says she knew immediately that God wouldn't make her wait 16 years for a sick boy and that I was a healthy girl. She had my brother two years later; my older brothers were adopted before me. 

When I came out as gay, she struggled with it. That didn't last long, but at that time she made it clear that I could "transition ten years after (she) was dead." She reiterates that periodically as well. When I started keeping my hair short, she struggled, but I tease her and tell her that I brought home my high femme wife so I'm no longer obligated to be femme. 

In 2012, she ended up in the ICU for 11 days and almost died because of a whole host of medical issues we didn't know existed. We worked on them for two and a half years before learning that she has non alcohol related cirrhosis. She remained sober her whole life (her father was a drunk) so that she could avoid that exact problem. If you didn't know, there is no treatment or cure for cirrhosis. 

I don't get very many more years with my mom. I know that for sure. It's in the early stages, but it sometimes progresses very quickly. I don't want to waste what little time I have making her view me as a man when I know that is the last thing she wants to do. 




 I (20 AFAB) identify as genderqueer and transmasculine. I have done nothing to transition, medically or socially, because I don't want to risk my family for it. My mom got three sons and me and has made it clear that she will not support transition. Recently I've started to realize that I have a lot of symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder. One of the symptoms is inconsistent identity. I bounce around from full male to almost female identity all the time, but it doesn't feel the way genderfluid is often described; it's harsh and difficult and hurtful and confusing, not fluid at all. I also have depression and anxiety. I was reading the post about dysphoria and it's effects on you without you knowing and I was just wondering if this could be at all self inflicted. I know you guys and gals aren't trained mental health counselors but if you know anything, please share. I'm sorry if this sounds crazy or in any way transphobic, I don't mean for it to.

 So do my pups! Mya is Mya-Doodle-Do, Doodle Dog, and Doodle Bug. Reese is Reesey Puff, Fluffer Nutter and Fluff Butt. On a side note, my brother has a dog named Pope that is a black boxer, so I call him George Foremen or Georgie.  




 That's a great name for a cat! 




 That's adorable! What's his name? 




 I added pictures to the top. 




 They are named Mya, who is 3, and Reese, who is 2. I hate to play favorites, but Mya is like a super dog. She is protective, helps me during anxiety attacks and wakes me with kisses. She is also wicked smart. Her only bad trait is that she barks at all strangers. Reese on the other hand isn't as smart or sweet. She's a good pup but Mya is just perfect. 




 They're mutts. They are Yorkie, Chihuahua, Dauchsund, Cocker Spaniel mixes. One looks like a small black lab, the other looks a lot like a Dauchsund.

The solid black one is named Mya. She is 3, her birthday is February 29th. The one with brown is Reese, she's 2 and her birthday is April 5th. 




 This is freakishly close to my ravioli recipe. 




 Otherwise you'll serve barely warm ribs to your boyfriend's roommates. 




 Cam Tucker? 




 Goods and services can be e changed for money. 




 It is generally stated as distracting. Also, many districts opt to put students in in school suspension, not just home to change. Both truly are distracting to an education. I agree that situational appropriateness is important, I just don't see schools as really aiming to teach that. 














 How can you tell that I was shadowbanned? My wife went through and upvoted all of my posts for my first two pages, which She does periodically. I don't have any alts.  




 Those can he transmitted even with a clean mouth. 




 Do you recognize that disease can't be spread through a beard or a dirty mouth, but it can through blood and other menstrual fluids?  




 If that's true then I assume women are also made to remove peach fuzz. Otherwise, you are full of shit. Based on your irrational anger and name calling, I'm going to assume the latter. Have a nice day, and make friends with someone who can help you handle your mental health issues. 




 Except it's literally a health risk to everyone to have menstrual fluid everywhere. It isn't a health risk to have a beard. 




 I'm not saying he should quit his job to grow a beard. I'm saying razors aren't a necessity and that if *he* cares so much about it, then that's his solution. Not having to pay tax on a luxury item is not a solution. 




 You know women use razors too right? And he can always just get a different job. No one is forcing him to work there. Science forces me to bleed from my vagina and I can't have it all over everything. 




 I saw it in a video like 4 years ago and it came up on Google just now, so it might be. 




 For my monogamous marriage, that's the issue. Other people's relationships are not my relationships. 




 T can make you sterile but it also isn't considered an effective birth control. 




 No, *I* don't, but it's not my body or my child, so it's not my place to make that call. 




 Yes, they are. 




 Why does it matter? If no genitals or nipples are showing, it's not a girl's responsibility to keep a boy from looking.

Edit: do you guys realize that bottoms of buttcheeks are no more indecent than cleavage? If it's not indecent exposure, no one but the owner of the body or the owner of the body's parent gets to decide what shows. 




 I though Spider Man was from a bite from a specially bred super spider? Though, I've only seen the Toby McGuire movie. 




 Rub the negative side of a D battery on it. 




 Adding "Mc" to a name is appropriation of Irish naming roots and I will not stand for it. Somebody get me a chair. 




 Yeah....... Putting someone else at risk for STDs isn't the same as your partner jacking off because you aren't feeling it. 




 I think you're leaving something out. You come off a bit misogynistic, or at least completely oblivious, for other reasons. 

I am very high libido married to someone very low libido. She was low libido before we got married, but it got worse after. It isn't that she doesn't want to fuck me. She truly just can't get there. She can't force herself to be in the right head space. She also leads me on quite a bit. She'll spend a day promising me and sending me dirty texts and at night she just can't get there. Its not that she intentionally lied, she just isn't there, and that isn't her fault. 

You aren't wrong for wanting compatibility, but it seems like you never really tried to have a heart to heart with this girl about this. Her explanation sounds like she was raised to believe that sex is for marriage, and she feels shame for having it before. It's a really destructive mentality that causes a lot of issues. It sounds a lot like you got an answer you didn't like and didn't want to work on the issue.

For a lot of people, security and love are needed to feel comfortable to have sex. If she was asking you to listen more, she wasn't feeling enough of those things to be comfortable. 

You were a bit of an asshole in telling her that was the reason. You took something out of her control that you knew was an issue early on and threw it at her. Her libido is something she can't change. The only reason to give a reason when breaking up is so the person can work on themselves for their next relationship. All you did was make what already seemed to be a big insecurity worse. I think She dodged the bullet. 




 I don't get how she can be nine months pregnant with a fetus in her arms. 




 I watched that in World History in high school! 




 This sounds like something a sim would say. 




 Oh god. I'm a 20 year old woman and I say chauvinist. 




 Only vaguely related.

I used to be friends with this guy. One night, I'm driving him home cause we had been hanging out. We are all just chatting when he says to my wife and I, "Do you think Canada wants to kill us since we share such a big border with them?" I flipped out explaining to him why he was a goddamn moron. 

I worked for 18 months as a companion to a man with Down syndrome. It was mostly to help me build my resume as I'm a social work major looking into mental health, and it's related enough. The same guy as the Canada situation **tagged me** on Facebook in a picture of a cat with "Down syndrome". In fact, the cat was missing a facial bone and I explained why that was impossible and why saying it had DS was insensitive and actually extremely offensive. He said that people would do their own research and that he wasn't taking it down because he wasn't offending anybody. 

I no longer associate with that individual. 




 What word should have been used?  




 My mom has four children. We are 44, 32, 20, and 19. 




 Thank you! Yours is pretty snazzy as well! 




 Yep. She loves it there! I hope it's as good for you as it is for her. :) 




 I wish I could do that. I feel hopelessly committed to everything and even when all I need to do is stay home and be with myself I have no choice, I just have to go. 




 My best friend from middle school goes there! 




 My wife and I have been together almost 5 years. Our room is a mess and we often can't remember when one another bathed. It works for us though. 




 I'll go against the grain. It was too soon. I was 15 and had been dating my 16 year old girlfriend for 2 months. We both agree that we should have waited longer. Neither of us was really ready and it lead to a lot of issues in our relationship for a while. We're 20 and 21 and married now though so it couldn't have been all bad. 




 You're kind of socially retarded if you have no dating experience by college, especially if it's because of mom and dad.

Edit: I literally meant socially delayed, not trying to insult people with developmental disabilities. 




 Discouraging exclusive relationships is encouraging promiscuity. There is nothing wrong with promiscuity, but be aware of that. People date younger now, too, and your forbidding it won't change that. You are setting your child up to be an outcast. 

Sleepovers should not be allowed unless with people who are just friends. This won't stop sex, but will prevent it under your roof. Also, don't dismiss her relationship. I am married to a woman I started dating at 15. Her relationship may very well be real. 

I know you are trying to do what's right, but you aren't really in the right decade. 




 Same to you. :-) 




 Plenty of kids don't take it seriously enough at all. I've heard about parties where young gay men try to get it as soon as possible so they don't have to worry about going bareback. That's terrifying. I didn't mean to minimize it, just explain that it isn't as awful as it was 30 years ago. Its still not something anyone should want to have; it is still deadly. I'm sorry that my explanation came off as blas like AIDS isn't a terrible thing. For anyone reading this, AIDS is awful and not something to be taken lightly, it's just less awful than it was a few decades ago. 




 Can you explain why it riled you so much? My intention wasn't to hurt feelings, but to explain the common confusion of AIDS then and now. 









 Thank you for that! That makes me feel really good! 




 Do you set your own price or is it decided by Amazon?

 That's really shitty. I'm sorry you have had that in your life. 




 I'm basing that opinion on the men that I know, not any real evidence. You are beyond free to disagree. 

I subscribe MFA because I love the community and a lot of the stuff they post is great. I can't actually afford anything they recommend but it gives me an idea of what looks good and what to pair it with. There is also /r/lesbianfashionadvice and /r/boifashionadvice, which I mod but it's like totally dead air.
