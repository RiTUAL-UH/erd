 i saw an article the other day but i thought it was a hoax but today RebelScum.com has another article confirming the find from another reader. I'm still on the fence about the validity of these findings. Have cancelled figures complete w/ cardbacks ever made it the sales floor before? And they're selling them at 20$ a pop. 


 Following our earlier story, Brendan sent in detailed [images](http://www.rebelscum.com/2015/Found-In-The-Wild.jpg) of the Legacy Collection Droid Factory figures he found at retail. Looking at the date stamp on the card backs, these figures were produced on October 10th, 2012. They were found for $19.99 each at a Go! Calendars outlet in Pooler, GA, which is promising for everyone in the U.S. interested in finding these figures since it is a nationwide chain.

 taking the rebel flag down is a good thing but ultimately ineffective b/c it's not going to fix gun control but it does give ppl a tangible outlet for them to focus their energy into and that's a pretty good distraction. 

 




 special treatment? http://i.imgur.com/iIOJ0X7.jpg

this dude shot 16 ppl. not trying to compare bad apples to bad apples but i don't think there is any special treatment going on. just look at all that white privilege.

if they did have have anything in common it's that they were both obnoxious baby-faced racist sociopaths who liked killing.

 to be completely fair, it was an accident.

yah i see your side of it. 




 Thank you pashaMad for your submission! Unfortunately, your post has been removed for the following reason(s):

***It breaks rule 1:*** **Use the correct title formatting.** Titles should be to the point, and all extra information or context should be added in the comments. 

Here is how you should format it - 

Your artwork - "Title, Medium, Size" 


Also remember no extraneous information in the title means do not state that it's your first time using a medium in the title, or write 'Hey Reddit', 'What do you think?'

 it wasn't a matter of the post getting removed. i could care less about that. it was his wording and bluesmoke's comments the other day that leave me thinking theyre attacking me.  




 am i not a user too? whats the deal with the new mods having a hard-on for me? 

  There's no excuse for you to have missed it.

accidents happen, things get overlooked. i did scroll the front page but i didn't see it. 

edit: i love a good cutaway, you can't fault me for that

double edit: i remove reposts all the time in /r/art. but i don't get bent out of shape about it.

 i'm wondering if they repair the broken section and kinda of force it back into place like a bicycle chain. seems highly unlikely tho w/o a make-shift crane to lift the chassis up.

 while researching your pic i found this: https://www.reddit.com/r/AbandonedPorn/comments/3bf5o5/japanese_machine_gunners_nest_on_iwo_jima_that/ 




 A heavy machine gun, possibly a Japanese Type 92 Heavy Machine Gun, lies abandoned in a bunker overlooking the landing beaches. There are still dozens of these bunkers all over the island. Most of them were destroyed during the battle. This pillbox still bore the scars of the fighting. It was pockmarked with bullet holes and the inside was blackened. I imagine a flame thrower was used to clear that pillbox.

 she painted this on a canvas. no computer programs.  




 hands 









 so long and thanks for all the fish... 




 source is nsfw: http://www.anna-art.com/paintings/anna_razumovskaya/figurative/12288.html 









 

Anna magically captures classic romanticism of renaissance portraiture, figurative forms while creating art that is completely modern and original. Anna is inspired by the graceful elegance of the female form, at turns, classically alluring, demure and provocative. 

Some words from the artist: 

  "My art is a reflection of my life, a reflection of myself...
"...If an artist were asked what he was thinking of while creating his work, he would hardly give a reasonable answer to that question. This process can not be analyzed. It is like a miracle. "

More about this particular piece: 

 She stands before us, half-exposed and half-mystery. We chase her for evermore inspiration but never exhaust her complex character. She continues to surprise us through her eclectic taste and individuality. Her wild arrangement of fabrics stands as evidence of her raw character.

source is nsfw: http://www.anna-art.com/paintings/anna_razumovskaya/figurative/12288.html but i highly recommend them if you like this piece.

 i've always enjoyed [this PS](http://i.imgur.com/5FmnxrU.jpg) of him. 




 under US law; farmers can still use a small amount of chemicals on their crops and still call them "organic". Truth. 

no such thing as natural b/c the FDA allows company's to take advantage and embellish what *is* really natural. Hydrogenated Oil's are not natural. But you'll often find them in food products labeled to dupe the consumer while still offering a product at a responsible cost to the consumer but also maximizes company profits *b/c they use cheap ingredients*.   




 only the devil could survive two heart-attacks and still be alive. 




  Still doubt it, our military is pretty much the best. 

that's a pretty good reason, why we're going broke.

 Gouqi Island belongs to a group of nearly 400 islands known as Shengsi Islands, and form a part of the Zhoushan Archipelago, located outside of Hangzhou Bay. It is the largest archipelago of China. Traditionally Zhoushan had relied heavily on its primary industry, which is fishing, given Zhoushan is the largest fishery in China. Nowadays with the development of the secondary and tertiary industries, Zhoushan's economic base has been largely diversified. Ship building and repairing, shipping, light industry, tourism and service industry grow to be the major contributors of local economic output. Consequently, many fishing villages have today become abandoned. Some of the best preserved villages are located in Gouqi Island.

The Shengsi Islands are a popular tourist destination and is still an important fishery area that attracts more than 100,000 fishermen every winter.

 are you looking forward to hitting puberty?  




 i'm sure that would mean alot to her especially coming from such a prolific and creative artist such as yourself.  




 you look like Spike Lee's retarded, less successful bother.  




 so how many of your ex boyfriends have you killed so far?  




 your forehead is so big, i could play the game of Risk on it. 




 is this mf a girl or a guy?  




 I can't tell if he's Italian or black?

Cant. Understand. Normal. Thinking. 




 b-l-o-w-j-o-b 




 lol keep telling yourself that!  




  It is a relief. Her own mother commented that she didn't know how I put up with her bitchiness. 

birds of a feather tho??? 




 this is exactly what i think of when i see in the news that an old man killed his wife of so many years. I guess they just finally snap from all the verbal abuse.  




 You just need to add the "Size" of the piece in title. You can't edit your submission title so you'll need to resubmit. Let me know if you have any more questions.

Some words from the artist regarding this piece:

Rusaka is a slavic female demon usually appearing around lakes, ponds or rivers. She deceives men and drowns them. I wanted to show her as a dead corpse that uses a charm, so that she looks like a pretty woman when out of the water.

I've had some voices wondering about the swastikas on the rims of the guys shirt. So to make it clear. I have no connotations with any extreme right wing parties nor do I keep any nazi or racist oriented beliefs. Swastika has been used for hundreds of years in Poland, before Hitler stole it and spoilt it for everyone. The action of the image takes place in 9th or 10th century. If you want to know more about swastikas just wiki it. There is a really broad and interesting article written about it.

 i used all 300 characters. can anyone tell? 

 Torre Abraham Lincoln, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Construction on the two circular 36-story towers remains empty and unfinished since construction was halted in 1974. Conceived as the centrepiece of Lucio Costas modernist plan for the region, the Torre Abraham Lincoln buildings were intended to be the first in a series of 76 individual towers. The plan was eventually abandoned due to poor material choices and the inability to secure enough of the projects land due to private ownership. 

more additional pics and history of the failed project: http://paraisoocupado.com/?paged=2

note, there are two of these that stand side by [side](http://img.weburbanist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/abandoned-skyscrapers-torre-barra-rio.jpg)

i feel like these top mods forgot that these subs are not even our's/their's to begin with and we're all just guest here. Disappointing top mods (who we rely on to be rational individuals) would make such a hasty, irrational response to close their subs. 

the actions of the top mods that closed their subs are *not* the path of a jedi.

'A ____ I did' or any variation or be subjective in the title ("awesome work," "amazing piece" etc). Also do not mention your 'cake day' or use karma-bait titles.

 Thank you for your submission! Unfortunately, it has been removed for the following reason(s):

* It does not include significant context in the title, such as the artist's real name (not their pseudonym). The name you are looking for is "Kevin Lee Broberg".



Feel free to resubmit the image with proper context. If you have any questions, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FImaginaryFutureWar). We apologize for the inconvenience. 




 no, i still consider it art but there is a better place for it. We exclude fat art because they would eventually take over the sub. /r/alternativeart would like this. 




 Ahhhhh. Good call and good job  




 it's prolly the trans-fat and saturated fats that make it taste so good. you'll never be able to replicate that unless your a chemist.

 omg. i can feel the sarcasm coming through your words. that's a really unhealthy pie.  




 you don't have to explain yourself :) i'm the same way. I'm sure you've already read the ingredient listing on the back? Sometimes i write to these companies via email and act concerned about allergy info. you could always try that.

 you need to wait 3 days in between self-posts. 




  It was okay the last ~48 pics. Why is it now wrong?

don't you think that's a little excessive? a little spammy? Sometimes these things slip through the cracks.  




 yes, you really should. i like it.

 we have "rotating" banners. click your refresh to view others in random. 




 it's actually kinda coincidental you posted this and then we implemented new banners a day ago. when i've had them done for over two weeks now. 

i think it looks great as a banner dont you think? 


edit: we're always looking for new mods that want to contribute to the network on a regular basis. ;) 




 Yes! Mos def thank you very much for the plug. We're very gracious.  




 my apologies. i thought we were talking about /r/imaginarymindscapes. i was confused.  




 *uggggggghhhhh.* i'm sorry. 

 




 no, i didn't draw this. and you've commented on plenty of my submissions to know that i'm just another ordinary user on reddit like everyone else. but i am interested in knowing how you feel about the sub.

unlike some other stuff I could link.


could you elaborate and explore this statement for me? I'm very interested in hearing your thoughts.


do you feel like the sub has changed since it's initial offering?  




 /r/disappointedboners??? 




 prolly from one of the links i posted :P 

another hidden gem sub, if you ask me.

 The bust of the late Philippine strongman Ferdinand Marcos lies badly defaced Monday, Dec. 30, 2002 at Mt. Pugo, La Union province in northern Philippines, a day after it was ripped in a powerful explosion shortly after midnight Sunday. The explosion ripped off the eyes, nose, ears and most of the upper part of the bust but did not topple it from the top of a cliff overlooking the South China Sea, where it was erected in the 1970s, allegedly to immortalize the strongman who was toppled in a near bloodless "People Power" revolution in 1986.
