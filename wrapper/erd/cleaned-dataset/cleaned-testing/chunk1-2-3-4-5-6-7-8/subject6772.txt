 It's just holy water to test if they are demons. Someone there watches too much Supernatural. 




 I'm almost 50 and I still try to grab a little feeding when I can. Which might explain why I keep getting called into HR. 




 Which was the bad part, the chicken or the cuffs? And which came first? 




 Yeah, the right is so obsessed with Obama he is in their mind on every single thing in the world. Ebola? Obama's fault. Some folks in a place where there is a lot of turmoil kill some people? Obama is to blame and congress must investigate like 15 times.

Bush and 9/11 and anthrax? "Why don't you leave bush alone? America is at war, you can't criticize our president during a tragedy! Benghazi!" 




 The GOP is an apocalyptic cult, so they will follow to be sure. They will gladly throw US troops into a war and take US dollars to give to Israel (so much for bootstraps/etc) because they think god will pat them on the head and give them some virgins or something in the next life.

Cons - don't trust them. They put religion and money ahead of country and family. 




 It has less of a zing, like budweiser in plastic vs bottles. But, damnit, I like to have a choice! 




 Another responsible gun owner.... 




 They ate a pancakes family? Did they have blueberry eyes and strawberry noses? 




 LOL. Ole Dick played the "The liberal media is complaining about us because we are republicans". 

Suck it up, dick. I will say I am happy that he is just doing playboy interviews now and not screwing up the country and shooting people. 




 So now I have to pee in glass bottles when I am there? I dunno, never liked the flavor of plastic compared to glass. 




 Were they around and active before we invaded Iraq to save the US from certain invasion from Iraq?

Was there even Al Qaeda in Iraq before that?

Ah...Iraq. The right waves flags and crosses and talks about how the Americans who died there as though they died or were injured to save us all....and yet the only thing they died for was bush's  and the right's personal desire for war.

Go America! 




 So what does it mean that Obama handily won, twice?

Oh - that they approved of his job and the ACA. Got it. Thanks :) 




 I'll bet the right isn't too happy about this. Whether it is blacks/gays serving their country or being allowed to marry they are convinced that America is failing because we don't have a military and marriages like they envision in their heads.

I am sure they are praying right now for god to whip up a hurricane to punish some people over this. 




 So gays won't be able to convert kids anymore in schools by promising them free ipods with Judy Garland songs? 




 He had some stormtroopers try to rob a bank for him but they ended up being the gang who couldn't shoot straight. 




 Is he related to Dirty Harry? 




 /r/gonewild

Hasn't affected me in any negative way. 




 Well, maybe she was just testing her thesis :) 




 Yep, I was right :) A conservative. Soooo easy to spot on here. You need a hug. 




 A river full of unicorns and rainbows? Oh...let me guess. You are a conservative aren't you :) 




 Why not look at your own link's title?

Or do you just like to make up things in hopes of getting attention? 




 Wait, what 'facts'? That Obama watch it all happen? That he ordered troops to stand down?

This has been investigated more than 9/11/2001 and the Anthrax mailings combined. And at every turn the RW BS has proven to be...wrong. 




 The press: "Hey, can your HR dept, which has nothing else to do, go grab this personal information from a file and hand it to us? What is taking you so long? Why won't you just give us what we want now?? It has nothing to do with politics. Drop what you are doing and pay attention to us." 




 Romney soon to be 0-2 against black men. 




 Hopefully Holyfield will only use 47% of his power when punching him.

But I can see the right spinning this now "Black man attacks Romney!" and then tying it to Ferguson protests. 




 From the report: "The Islamic Republic of Iran is an ongoing threat to US national interests because of its support to the Asad regime in Syria".

The 'terrorism' section is one page long and isn't broken down by country.

So not sure, overall, what the big deal is. 




 So - what do you want Obama to do? Ignore how the court ruled??

It's settled and the FR has been updated to reflect the facts - some I know cons don't like. Maybe you would like him to say "Hey, I am the king and don't care how the courts ruled on this issue! And let's not update things to reflect reality to please the right."

Ok..whatever floats your outrage boat. 




 It's not about feelings, it's about facts. The court ruled in bush's favor, that changed the nature of foia and this is simply an extension of that. By updating the FR they will probably not avoid headaches but will be ensuring the public has the facts as it relates to those regulations as the court has ruled. It's pretty simple and basic - unless you think Obama should act all king like and ignore the court ruling? 




 So you are against updating the federal register to reflect the reality from the bush court case? Ok....whatever. 




 I support them on this. The court battle started under bush played out that way and all the Obama Admin is doing is updating the Fed. Register to reflect reality.

 




 Sure - as soon as republicans stop being mad about people needing help and maximizing their kitchen with food to survive.

Why is it no one on the right gets upset when companies use the law/resources to their advantage but call people lazy bums when they tap resources to survive? 




 That has to be a tough competition to judge. It's like having a barrel full of idiots swimming in ignorance and trying to decide which one to grab and declare as the best swimmer.

Gotta love republicans. Love spending money on 'defense' but when it comes to things that actually are harming our citizens - from climate to lack of health care, etc, they balk. 




 And he starts off with a Hitler reference.

Fear mongering, it's what the cons are good at. Scare people into spending more on defense, screw up diplomacy, hype terrorism and china/russia, and then start some wars. 

We've had two Iraq wars and one in Afghanistan to make us safer - apparently they didn't do that because we are now less safe than ever. So, let's spend more money!

Reminds me of education. Every election pols tell us it is broken, elect them and they will fix. I am almost 50 and they say the same thing every time. Apparently they all suck because every election they tell us it is still broken. 




 There are some things I don't think Obama is criticized enough for this - this is one of them. Other things though can get downright silly :) 




 Things were better under Clinton, and Obama, than ever under Bush.

Of course some folks like em some wars and tax cuts to pay to for the wars (how tax cuts pay for them is beyond me, apparently if you cut a billion in taxes it makes a trillion using some voodoo magic) 




 Like I have said before, the right can't admit when it is wrong and it just makes up stuff to scare the weak minded.

Obama WILL take all your guns, he will crash the stock market, he will destroy america, open the borders, make it illegal for your kids to do chores (2012), he hates israel and will destroy (in 2008 people claimed he didn't even say the word 'Israel' in the debates), he ignored ebola and it killed us all....

They haven't been correct about anything. But they still keep making up stuff and never, ever, admit they were wrong about other things. 




 Can Rahm beat Jesus? If he does, look for a Mel Gibson film to cover the details. (ok, going back to my corner now) 




 The right was recently all bent about "White Students Not Allowed To Attend Black Lives Matter Event At Illinois High School, Sparks Controversy "

There can be stories every single day about any other race running into issues because of their race and the right just passes them right on by. They don't claim it is wrong, they don't care one wit. The second a white person runs into some bigotry (or a Christian vs a muslim/hindu/etc) the right suddenly 'cares'.

Then they claim "Look, some others do it as well! So why complain when whites do it? Huh? Go on, explain why my being racist is bad but when someone else does it no one pays attention? It happened once, just look at that high school!"

Yeah...no one takes the right serious on race matters anymore.
 




 When you are dealing with the right, just ignore facts and go with 'belief'. "God controls the heavens and weather!"

The people most skeptical of climate change are the people who most believe in sky fairies.

Funny how that works.

 




 Wait, what, really?

Hey, the people behind this (the ambassador) said a lot I agree on when it comes to Iran. 

Look at the evidence. A biased person from a biased source has said something with no proof to back it up. Back it up.

Conservatives are just upset Obama beat them. Twice. So they make up things because everything they have said to date hasn't come to pass. All they have to go on now is hearsay. 

Did Obama, for example, take people's guns away? Nope. But they said he WOULD. Not that he could. That he would. And the right believed that, without any facts, because....well, hell I don't even know why.

Every prediction from the right about Obama has been wrong, but people put them out there as fact because they want to believe.

 




 This is how we should handle elections. 




 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

And Obama is gonna take all your guns, make it illegal for kids to do chores, open the borders, make the US a caliphate, ignore ebola while it kills us all, crash the stock market, send gas to 10/gal, etc.

We get it. The right lives in a fantasy land. 




 Off topic - your comment reminds of that scene in "It's a wonderful life" where George Bailey averted a run and had two dollars left and put them in a basket and commented that he hoped they would be fruitful and multiply :) 




 When I take calls from my X about her new hubby and take her out for something to eat and to talk to comfort her. 




 Record heat in Southern CA.

Here is how republicans view the world: "I looked out my window, and it was snowing, so warming is a lie because out my window is he whole world. Git r done!" 




 The AG's job is to enforce the law, it's congress's job to change it. 

And yes, I do remember that. And what has been the result? People getting pissed off and pushing harder for it to be legalized. 

*Princess Leia: The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.* 




 I think the point is - when haven't we handed them money? And I read both articles (the NYT one was better IMHO). We have become so used to the US just tossing around cash to everyone but the poor and needy here no one even blinks anymore unless they can make a political point out of it.

 




 I think I confuse her in my old age with Loretta Lynn a lot.

Overall: Obama nominated her, she won't serve very long, and I don't see that her impact will be all that much given the scope of the job and the short term she will be serving. If congress approves her and Obama is for her than what I think of her isn't relevant at all to anyone. 

I am pro MJ but short of some national legislation making it legal I don't see her views on it impacting much. It's not like cheech or chong were nominated. If her job is to uphold the law as it is written her views on it all won't matter a lot anyway - though she could divert resources. 

What does one expect a person to say when applying for a job "I think your rules suck and I won't endorse them or enforce them"? 




 No, would rather they actually vote - it's kind of the job we pay them to do. Whether or not they confirm is up to them. They questioned her, have the information they need, now do your job.

 




 Her merits aren't what the discussion is about - bringing her nomination to a vote is. They can do it, they just don't want to because they are pouting. 




 Still haven't found anything?

Here's a start:
http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/US-releases-450-million-of-frozen-Iranian-funds-citing-compliance-to-nuclear-deal-349830

You know, honoring deals that were made, etc. You can dig more from there. But I am guessing if Obama didn't release those funds the right would call him a liar, king, etc.

Maybe you could find the actual deal. How it was made, who made it, signed it, etc - that is,  if the issue is something you are actually interested in instead of just an unintelligent attack. 




 *The administration that Biden is part of has instead been releasing $490 million a month to Iran.*

Now, why don't you go and fact check that, as I did some time ago, and see what comes up. Go on. I'll wait a minute. 




 That guy in the background with the hat on and gray shirt looks like Binny from supernatural (and is that lady wearing an orange hooter's shirt?). 

http://31.media.tumblr.com/10e6a2ef0ba94a994884afcc25897cfe/tumblr_mwcda44wqk1qdcaeco2_500.gif

Anyway, open carry doesn't bug me. But since this is from dead bart I will check elsewhere to get the real facts.
 




 I can be understanding here towards cops. They see it as tool to aid them in serving and protecting. I can't blame them for wanting to do their jobs better.

On the other side of the equation is concern about government employees having data that isn't relevant to any particular crime but could be misused many ways. 

Now, given that there are trust issues between citizens and government I can sympathize with the citizens here more than I can with cops (who often have their own trust issues with citizens).

My solution? Set up a framework of standards. From how data is stored to it's retention period. Shorten the normal retention period but allow a longer one - one where after the short term the data is encrypted and requires, essentially, a 'key party' to access it and the signature of a judge. 

After the longer period data is purged and it is certified that data was purged and any data that is used in a criminal case that happens to have not been purged (accident/willfully) will be tainted.

Lastly, make sure there are stiff penalties should these procedures not be followed. Both criminal and civil. 




 Actually, I have no problem with them at all. Or gun ownership. But thanks for playing :) 




 Just buy some damn ear muffs and you won't hear them. Sheesh, why does everything have to be so complicated? 




 Do a little digging. Note a few things, the original source for example. Also note the name of the ambassador and look at the group he belongs to (and what they say about Iran). What you will find is one quick blurb made on a radio show (Mark Levin), never substantiated, verified, looked into, anywhere. 

So some guy, on a nutball radio show, claims secret meetings took place - and the guy making the claim is from PJ Media...Yeah. OK. I put stock in that.... 




 Good thing he didn't have his hands in his pockets, they would have beaten him for having a concealed weapon, or shot him if they thought his thumb was cocked back and ready to go pew pew pew. 




 Not Obama - that has been debunked. But cons will believe anything if you say it about Obama. 




 He went for a walk over to Palin's back porch for a cup of tea. You 'betcha! 




 What whiners. The money would come from restitution funds. And turtle man is just trying to hold the nomination hostage (sort of like the iranians held Americans hostage back in the 70's...hmm, letters to Iran and holding up a bill on human trafficking. Alex jones should put the two together).

If you believe in a bill put it to a vote and quit playing games, and don't make excuses for holding up this AG nomination longer than any in the last 30 years. 




 This investigation has taken longer than than 9/11/2001 and been investigated more that it and Anthrax combined.

And all their fishing trip has done so far is make fools of conservatives who ran about making up all kinds of wild accusations. 




 Conservatives to scientists: "God controls the weather, it's why he sends hurricanes to punish people who are for gay marriage. All we have to do is pray and sweet baby jeebus will save us. Of course, if all you godless libs would read the good book, you would see climate issues are a sign from god and a punishment on you all. Git r done!"

And that, my friends, is the republican position on science. 




 That when they lift the veil they will see Hillary underneath it. And I would pay well to see their faces when that happens :) 




 Did you even read the article? What is it you 'believe' that folks will find? Want me to help you out? I can. 




 LOL...Oh, ok. So the State Dept is 'Challenging' Hillary on this?

Right. Really, does anyone take fox serious anymore when they write such headlines? Oh, don't answer that - we know the right won't look past the headline much. 

*She said the department only started automatically archiving emails for other senior officials in February.* - note, "senior officials" - which isn't even defined by anyone. Google it. There are 9 of them. 

Why didn't fox make note of that? I mean, it is basic fact checking.


 




 No, they aren't. They are looking into a tax exempt group that may have violated conditions of funding. But fox knows the right won't think for themselves so they make up headlines.

Back in 2008 Obama was gonna take all the guns away according to the right. Has that happened or were they just making up shit like now? I'll let the facts answer that :) 




 Republicans will oppose this. The idea of not being able to control a woman and her personal choices upsets them deeply.

What they would like to see is the child born, hungry and homeless and in this case motherless so they can practice their own brand of Christianity and tell the kid he is a lazy bum, worthless, and no way they will support him/her getting foodstamps or a free lunch at school.

That is hard to do when someone is pregnant, so force them to have the kid so you can belittle them later. Oh, and discourage birth control, health care for the baby and pregnant woman (she should work harder if she wants care - what do you think we are, barbarians like in those other countries where people have single payer???)

But don't worry - the republicans are on the way to save the save day and force women to carry their babies to term. Git r done republicans. 




 Well, we changed it up a bit. On the gun thing:

We will announce that all gun owners can get a free bible and ammo when they bring their guns to a jesus station to be blessed by a rabbi. And for each gun they bring in to be cleaned, for free, they get a copy of the quran with Obama's face on the cover to burn (we will have a fire going with free smore's and such).

We will also be offering a free entry for each gun to a raffle. Grand prize is a 50 cal machine gun signed by reagan that was used to kill muslims after 9/11. Many won't be able to resist. And when they show up, Obama will personally take their guns (don't tell them, the place is already surrounded by isis folks to protect him).

Gonna be a hoot! See you there! 




 You give /politics too much credit. At my age I have spent a lot more time doing other things. Like working with conservative/republicans in the 80's/90's, being involved in a lot of religious groups (baptists/lutherans/pentecostals/etc) and a good amount of time studying eschatology and politics in general.

It is the right who insists we are a 'christian country' and that if we ally ourselves with Israel we will get god's blessing. 

You don't have to believe me. That is fine. Spend just a few hours if you like examining the links between religion, israel, republicans, fundies, and the push for war and come to your own conclusions. I offer only my many years of personal experience as evidence because I really don't believe if I gave you a slew of links/info you would care anyway. 




 The republicans won't listen. They want with Iran and they want Iran to pursue a nuke so they can have their war. Their minds are on Israel and the Apocalypse. Their bible, like the quran for fundie muslims, is their guide. Not science, not diplomacy, not common sense.

You can't rationalize with a fundie because their minds are based on beliefs and nothing else. The right prays for jesus to come back and kill everyone who hasn't converted. They believe their meal ticket to paradise is Israel...because 'god'. They don't want 72 virgins, but they do want a wedding feast in heaven.

The most dangerous people in the world are fundies, and we have a government full of them. 




 So... did he listen to the people when they said they wanted Obama? Twice? If so I am sure he has been supportive of his presidency. Cause, you know, he's a voter-listener.

 




 You can't order the Noblesse Oblige anymore - labor costs were too high so they took it off the menu and replaced it with grilled cheese since it has a better profit margin ;) 




 Every single time the min wage comes up people claim it will destroy america and cause businesses to close. We still have a glut of food joints and such places. A big mac costs more now than ever, and they are still selling.

Yet people don't seem to complain when investors want to cut costs and raise prices to get more of a return on their investment. Workers are investors (in time/labor) but when they ask for more return people get all upset. 




 As usual, a blog post with no intelligent thought which appeals to people who can't handle much more than that.

How about they take on things like this:
Why Are GOP Hopefuls Speaking At An Event With An 'Ex-Terrorist' Who Allegedly Threw Jews Off Buildings?

http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/why-are-gop-hopefuls-speaking-event-ex-terrorist-who-allegedly-threw-jews-buildings 




 I heard they were doing that so they have more room for fema trailers when they start operation rushhannity and round up all the republicans and take their guns. Shortly after Obama will declare the US a caliphate and attack Israel to bring on the apocalypse. Hillary will be the camp's commandant. 

Or something like that. 




 Mr Paul? Have a seat over there. 




 She didn't break the rules, all emails to others there are obviously recorded. SO: She could have used both state dept email and her own email for her personal emailing. Which would put us in the same boat now. Except some really want her personal emails. 




 Why, does he need a job or something? Maybe someone wants him to close down the US government and outsource it, seems to be his thing.  




 You mean by not screwing up the US and keeping our soldiers out of stupid wars? I'd rather have another clinton, the worst that could happen is sex and the best is no wars and booming economy. 




 Let me guess. Conservatives, fundies, republicans? Yep.

Well, I suppose when you believe god punishes America because of gay people the whole thing might make sense to you. Thankfully America is getting more diverse, less isis...errr fundie christian like, and more open minded. 

You can't stop progress now anymore that you could in the 60's, but the same people are using the same arguments now. 




 Even the people she sent them to? 




 See also 1:23 in for more specific information and the actual quote around then and it's real context.

http://www.appropriations.senate.gov/webcast/cjs-subcommittee-hearing-fy16-budget-fbi-us-marshals-service-dea-atf 




 Not really. Go to the link. Check the link they give. Watch the actual hearing.

One area of interest is at 1:14. Section relevant to this article is around 50 min in.

Might give people a different view on it all. 




 Spend money to help the poor and needy? Nope. Spend it to investigate hillary and benghazi? Hell yeah! 

If hillary wasn't running they wouldn't care one wit. If she decides not to I will laugh :) 




 I will add to that (but without the god part for now).

Here is what the right believes:

All humans can be wealthy
They can all own businesses

Of course, if that were true there would be no one to actually work.

"Look at me! I own a bank...but there is no one to work here, do IT, cash checks, etc"

Or "I own this large freighter and can pilot it and maintain it myself, and load it!"

Basically, they live in a fantasy world where workers aren't needed and hence have no rights.

Somehow, someway, I think maybe they think god and his angels will just do the actual work because they don't actually believe anyone has to work for anyone else, ever, anywhere. And if they do it is just because they aren't smart enough to own their own company.  




 *On Monday, Republican state lawmakers proposed a constitutional amendment that would block California's publicly funded colleges and universities from banning the American flag*

Ah, smaller government. Of course republicans like the flag. What else would they wave during their wars and drape over the coffins of those they sent to die in them?

How many 'died for our freedom' in Iraq? Cause, last time I checked, Iraq wasn't a threat to our freedom. 

Flags, crosses, bibles, and war. It is like the republicans are constantly trying to sell us a movie trailer. 




 Well, it all depends you see.

If the economy is bad, it's Obama's fault. If it is good - well congress makes the law. If spending is up and debt is up, well, Obama did that with his super magical presidential powers. If it is better, only congress can do that.

So the only thing that really matters is - do you hate the person in office or do you like them? 




 Well, fundies (conservatives), believe that gay marriage will cause god to send hurricanes and such. 

Apparently god doesn't care about cheating, lying, killing, corruption, screwing the poor and sick, etc. That stuff is just fine and dandy. But gays? Whew boy - that will bring punishment.

Fundies are a big part of why I am now an atheist and a liberal leaning person (Independent, but I won't vote for another republican so long as I live). 




 Ahhh, conservatives. They were upset when interracial marriage was allowed but 'traditional marriage' survived. Now that gays can marry they want to tell state employees "If you don't like having to do your job we will help you, because we know how hard it is on you to sign some papers".

Yeah. Ok. Maybe someday they will grow up and join the rest of the 21st century. 




 Well. Election isn't for another, what, 20 months, and she hasn't even announced yet. So...not sure anyone cares :) Heck, does she even have a job right now??

If it comes down to clinton vs bush I will look at the last two in office with that name and compare. Which one did better? 




 Good. I wonder how many hours of her phone calls weren't taped and we will never hear? People get all goofy about email - but phone and private conversations they just shrug off.

Maybe this will trigger a new patriot act if bush wins - where we will require all email, phone, and personal face to face conversations be recorded so everyone can view them.

Finally, the republicans will be happy - but, of course, they will still be investigating benghazi no matter what. 




 A crappy pic, was expecting it be some congressman. 




 Or is a trollportation device? 




 This makes me want to go to church. Do they use holy rollers to paint with? 




 Is there a pic of the poopatrator? 




 Is it a contest when you pay to enter, or gambling? :) 




 So? By the rules she could have a private account for emails. She is under no obligation to share her personal emails anymore than anyone else is required to tape all their phone calls for anyone (or record their personal conversations).

The right is doing all it can to bury good economic news. Obama must have them scared, their hopes for america to fall under his presidency has failed. All they have left are emails and benghazi..... 




 Is there anything they don't blame Obama for? Oh yeah - the economy improving. 




 No, it's just more ranting from some guy whose first name is the last name of his favorite author. 




 Judge made the right choice.

"The judge said if you allow one type of display, then you will have to allow all types." 




 What a whiner. People are still upset Obama beat them twice and there isn't a day that goes by they don't find some reason to try to convince us all that he is evil and America will turn out like it did under bush (wars, death, recession, less freedoms, etc). They have ratcheted up the rhetoric now that there is more good economic news. 




 Man, that fox station did a poor job of reporting. The Beast refers to trains in Mexico and the protest is in mexico and about mexico. The government down there has gotten more involved in the last year with the issue of immigrants going through mexico and chasing them off trains/etc. 

http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/central-american-migrants-and-la-bestia-route-dangers-and-government-responses

 




 I think someone needs a hug and to watch some My Little Pony. 




 Ah, leave it to the daily caller. When it's white people involved they suddenly care about rights. Black folks in ferguson/etc? They basically call then whiners and denied racism ever played a factor in that city in anything. Beat protestors, don't allow them to stand still, etc? Go for it. But a school punishing kids for racism? Why...the horror! 




 Is that anything like summoning a demon? 




 Wait...what? He had a 'watch' where he was supposed to be doing...well, what exactly? 

I love how the right gives Obama super powers. "He will ban all guns!" How? Can he do that? "Uh...no but he will!"

"Poll says race relations deteriorate, Obama to blame! Story up next on Fox."  




 Is the economy better now than 2008? Stocks up. Unemployment down. Profits up. If this were a republican president the right would have bands playing in the street and trumpets blaring all over the place. 

But now they have a sad. They wanted to see America get worse. They made all kinds of terrible predictions about what would happen. All your guns would be taken. Stocks would crash. America would crumble and lose it's freedoms. Etc.

You would think people would be happy we aren't struggling like in 2001-2008, bogged down with 100,000+ troops in wars, economy tanking, etc.

Naw. Some just like to whine. 




 "Hey, I don't like gays so I don't want to do the job I was hired for. That's ok right?"

gop: "Sure thing!" 




 2012:
When U.S. Ambassador to Kenya Scott Gration resigned his position early this morning, he said in an emailed statement, differences with Washington regarding my leadership style and certain priorities lead me to believe that it's now time to leave." 




 LOL. The closest they get is a letting in 1984 by ten dems - and what was it the right was saying about it then?

* ''This letter,'' Mr. Gingrich wrote, ''clearly violates the constitutional separation of powers. It's at best unwise, and at worst illegal.'' Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, who helped draft the letter to Mr. Ortega, calls Representative Gingrich's attack ''frankly ludicrous.'' *

So...I guess they feel the same now?? 




 But...but, Obama is a socialist dictator king and he already banned all the guns, why would he stop now at his moment of glory? It is not like him at all. Fox news must investigate this and explain why their portrayal of him as a dictator was off a bit.... 




 An old story from 2014 with no link to the actual law. Ok.... 




 I remember a lot of things. 30 million spent to investigate lewinsky/clinton. 15 mil for 9/11/2001. Anthrax? Don't recall that terror being investigated by congress. What was the stated goal of the benghazi investigation (it WAS investigated and a report released - and it debunked the right wing bs)?

Now, let's go back to the 9/11 investigation. How do we know everything was released? We don't. You never can. By the rw logic that investigation should still be going on today (at least until we can get the results some want).

 




 They don't want her Benghazi emails (what could they prove anyway??) what they want, and what gowdy is now going for, is ALL of her emails so that they (republicans) can view them and leak anything they can find not related to benghazi to try to embarrass her.

She turned them over and gowdy is now saying he doesn't believe the state dept turned over all of the benghazi ones and doesn't trust them to. So he wants them all to see for himself. So now he is accusing the state department of lying (which I am guessing would be a criminal act - but they aren't launching a criminal probe are they?)

Can any conservatives here tell us what they think they will find? That she caused it, let it happen, stand down orders, etc (all of which have been handled already)?

What they want is dirt ahead of 2016.

They have investigated benghazi more than 9/11/2001....why? 




 AM talk radio. 




 So basically - this was all a ruse to get *all* her emails to the "Bi-partisan" group so they can leak some for 2016. Very slick - looks like clinton made the right play in the long run :) 




 I can hear the conservatives now - just like on gay marriage "Now people can marry animals, their cousins, etc" they will be saying "Now people won't be allowed to do violence against cousins and their own kids! Where will government intrusion end??" 




 A fair question. If I had to guess I would say most who signed up were fellow citizens who needed it and don't let their personal politics make the decision for them. 




 Bush said he would be court painting the proceedings. With puppies he stole from war orphans. 




 I don't know if anybody did or not either. I wasn't reading everyone's emails. Can I get daily caller to write a story about me? 




 Well, from the right has told us - Obama is going to take all your guns, not allow kids to do farm chores, was born in kenya, crash the stock market, ebola would kill us all because of obama, he is a criminal, king, muslim, corrupt - so I am sure that they didn't think this would happen either. But...they have been wrong since 2008 on just about everything. 




 He is, apparently, a criminal. The right is stuck on this one - Obama's justice department is doing this - but the right swears anything Obama does is bad/criminal/etc. So they will find a way not to give him props on this and complain about it, while using it to smear dems in general.

Will be fun to watch :) 




 So, we have people like married couples that the right thinks she be headed by the male and the woman should stay at home - and now that may be the case....but instead of saying that the cons want to use the numbers to show how 'bad' things are. LOL.

"OH we can't give more aid to the poor, makes em lazy and then they won't go get a job!" and then later that day "There are no jobs cause of Obama". They keep trying to pass the buck instead of just admitting they hate the poor and needy and Obama as well and do anything they can to denigrate things and paint themselves as the solution. 




 Wait, wasn't SHE the head of the state dept? So she can make her own rules, that's what being the boss means. She worked hard to get where she was and thems the perks. Conservatives she be backing her here for doing her job like a boss. 




 Well, I don't like her myself :) But when people are more upset over this than things like bush, 9/11, Iraq war, etc and so on it amuses me a bit :) 




 So the head of the state department, who makes rules, didn't follow the rules a different head of state department had in place. Ok. 

*After this story was first published, a State Department official acknowledged the 2005 policy but emphasized that it is limited to records containing such sensitive information.*

So it wasn't a blanket policy. Ok. 




 Prostitution roundup. Sounds like something Monsanto would make for STDs. 




 Hooves up. Don't shoot. 




 So, an illegal immigrant christian eh? I knew it! Thanks Obama. He just lets anyone from the country of Latin in here. 




 Damn that big government anyway! Those guard troops should be in Iraq fighting for our freedoms against....well, I dunno. Saddam or something. Anyway, they should be fighting in wars where all good soldiers belong, and in 2016 when we get a republican back in office we will get back on track in Iran and such and put those troops right where conservatives want them. In war. 




 Is it ISIS or Christianity - sometimes, it is easy to get them confused. They both hope and pray for those who don't believe to die (see Revelation, apocalypse, 2nd coming, etc), they both want their religion to influence laws, and they both spend a lot of time converting others and warning of god's punishments, oh - and both have started wars in the middle east. 




 Not sure why she should. Is she employed somewhere? Did she violate a law that someone can point to? Or do people just like to randomly ask questions and complain when people don't answer them? 




 So rehosted content from gateway pundit and you repost from a link that references the same.

LOL. 




 So, who is this Clinton person? Does she have a job right now or something? Is there some reason we care about things that happened in 2000 or so? If so, I have some 9/11 questions I would like us to look into, and that whole anthrax thing too.

I know I have heard her name somewhere before, but then I have heard ashcroft, cheney, bush, and a lot of other names from back then. Maybe I am missing something.... 




 *"Moving people from welfare to work is what has made this program a success," Ryan said in a statement announcing the legislation.*

But, but, republicans keep telling us there are no jobs to get because of Obama. Hunh. Maybe they are just lying. As usual. 




 What did he say today he couldn't have said at home on the TV?

 




 Ohhhh I get it! So what the right wants Obama to do is break the law, so they can whine again about something.

*President Obamas new deportation amnesty could grant Social Security numbers to as many as 4 million illegal immigrants, making many of them eligible for tax refunds under the Earned Income Tax Credit*

Sooo....it triggers a law already in place and the right is wanting Obama to just stop it or something? Hey, maybe that republican congress can do the job you pay them for and change the law instead of whining that the law is being followed. 




 Oh hey - instead of using an article from 2011 how about you post what they are saying NOW?

https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/fcc-votes-net-neutrality-big-win 




 2011? Reaching there aren't you :) 




 I bet he believes bush called 9/11 a terror attack and that Obama didn't call Benghazi one. Bush called it a 'cowardly attack' that morning.

The guy obviously isn't too smart - which makes him a perfect candidate for the nomination. 




 *Heres the simple truth about our foreign policy. Our allies doubt us and our adversaries are all too willing to test us. No one should be surprised. No one should be surprised that dictators like Assad would cross the Presidents red line because he knows the President wont even defend the line that separates our nation from Mexico.*

Let's just get down to the brass tacks here. Under Obama we have deported more people and defended our border better than bush did. But let's not even bother with that.

What is Perry really trying to say here? That Assad sits around reading immigration reports from the US? Really? Is Perry that stupid? But OK, maybe Assad has nothing better to do.

So now we have Assad reading immigration reports and coming to the conclusion that Obama won't do anything about anything he does. Which is still silly. 

BUT maybe, just maybe.....

Assad sees how the right tries to stop anything Obama wants to do by yelling "He didn't get our approval first!" and realizes that if he does anything Obama won't be able to act because republicans will get in the way because they care more about politics than the country.

If I were Assad I would act more on that than anything else - divide America because you know one party will stand in the way no matter what. 



 




 Sad, but true. It's all a shell game and the right and the left not in power in America just beat each other up while the true enemies walk off with it all. 




 Take a look at the difference between the two. 

*Quantitative easing increases the money supply by flooding financial institutions with capital in an effort to promote increased lending and liquidity.*

Note the difference in broad based tax cuts and targeted items like this. There is a fundamental difference between the two, take your time and examine them both if you need to.

One has a direct purpose and a 'plan' (if you will). The other does not. 

 




 Well, hell. Now conservatives will be against it. 




 I tried to get to it, but it was throttled. 




 Don't tell him that, he might bring in a rocks and drop them on the floor. Oh wait...didn't someone just do that with a snowball? 




 Not when the supply is coming from tax breaks. As we saw with the tax holiday and cut bush pushed.  




 So what you are saying is that trickle down doesn't work? 




 You mean like the gun owner who killed 9 people today in Missouri? Yeah, folks like that worry us all. But the gun owners will rush in and say 'we are not all like that!' and then turn around and say 'a muslim killed someone, they all are to blame'.

Funny how it changes when your own ox is gored. 




 Corporate Profits Are At An All-Time Record Peak And Expected To Grow in 2014
http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertlenzner/2013/11/30/there-are-far-fewer-bears-on-the-stock-market-today-than-at-the-peaks-in-2000-or-2007/

We aren't hemorrhaging jobs, wage growth is set by companies, debt is high but we can thank a trillion in spending on wars for part of that and debt isn't always bad.

It just chaps the right wing that the nation didn't collapse like they claimed it would/hoped in 2008. 




 Which party is trying to do that?

*ast month, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich became the first high-profile conservative to champion one of the most extreme environmental positions in recent memory: total elimination of the EPA.*

So, okay, the stock market is up under obama, and was down under bush - great, we agree on that. 

Now, google 2008 obama will crash stock market. You will find such gems as:

Warning: Stocks Will Collapse by 50%

*Faber doesnt hesitate to put the blame squarely on President Obamas big-government policies and the Federal Reserves risky low-rate policies, which, he says, penalize the income earners, the savers who save, your parents  why should your parents be forced to speculate in stocks and in real estate and everything under the sun?

Billion-dollar investor Warren Buffett is rumored to be preparing for a crash as well. The Warren Buffett Indicator, also known as the Total Market Cap to GDP Ratio, is breaching sell-alert status and a collapse may happen at any moment. *

The right wing is a little butt hurt all the bad things they said would happen didn't. Jobs grew, the stock market soared, we didn't all die from ebola, people can still buy guns.

And here they are in 2015 still predicting doom and gloom like some cheap 900 line psychics. 




 You would think fox would be all over it slamming Obama. Hell, I might agree with them for once if they did. 




 Oh look - you just said we are in a recovery, though you claimed it is the worst one ever. I'd rather be in a bad recovery than a good recession/depression like under bush.

TIL learned that even though companies have more profit now than any time in history it was under the weight of restrictions that have kept them from growing, all put into place by Obama and which didn't exist at all under bush's superior plans (which saw...well, nothing good happen). 




 Has no one ever heard of skype? Why does someone need to come here and give a speech to congress? Can't he email it?

Maybe it's just grandstanding and politics. 




 Here, let me help out a bit on this:

Republicans: "Unemployment is high, because of Obama!"

Later that same day: "We won't extend UE benefits because there are plenty of jobs and people getting UE are just too lazy to get jobs"

So there are plenty of jobs according to them, but then there aren't....as usual, they make little sense. 




 More of that smaller government they are always talking about eh? I bet he proposed not helping kids who need food or medical care- but then, once kids are born the right aborts their care about them. 




 First: No conspiracy is being claimed by me about 9/11. But an attack of that magnitude certainly warrants more investigations into it than the 2012 one.

Second: The right is simply milking this to fuel their outrage. Republicans don't even have to have a stand on issues these days because they just rely on people buying into everything about Obama and scaring them into voting.

If you want to destroy faith in the system just look at bush. Stock market less than when he came into office, job loses, housing market, failed wars, etc - and NOW the right us upset and whining? Yeah. A tad selective don't you think? 




 No, I don't recall claiming that. What I am saying is people are making a mountain out of a mole hill because what some people said during an ongoing issue isn't what they desired to hear.

And now they want to punish someone for not running about yelling terrorism because it denied them the ability to use the deaths right away to denigrate an entire religion based on what some conservative faction of that religion's followers did. 




 Correction - they suspected. First off, just because some terrorist group claims something doesn't mean you believe them - they could be looking for street cred. 

Second - even if it was the tape could be a trigger event or the reason a group claimed it did it (look at claims made the folks beheading people, they list causes).

So, play it safe until you can prove otherwise and don't give credit out willy nilly.

Oh, and that group that claimed it did it?

Members of Ansar al-Sharia have regularly taken part in protests in Tunisia against perceived blasphemy and have been suspected in involvement in a number of violent incidents.

So, they claimed they did it, they have a history of violent attacks due to blasphemy.... 




 Yeah, and we don't have all the facts about 9/11 either - but the right sure pushed away those investigations in a hurry. And that whole anthrax thing? Repubs buried the chance for that investigation.

But hey, some groups looking for tax exempt status (including liberal ones) were looked at closely by the IRS before granting them that status and suddenly we have a crisis.... 




 They will probably try to tie them to Benghazi somehow. 

Also, from the article:
*Rep. Jason Chaffetz, Utah Republican and Oversight Committee chairman, said the ongoing investigations undercut President Obamas assertion last year that there was no evidence of corruption in the IRSs targeting.

I have no idea how the president came to such a definitive conclusion without all the facts, he said.*

And ya know, I don't know how the right has come to the conclusions they have either about it all without all the facts, but there they are - republicans running around saying they know what happened. Weird. So maybe all those blabbering on about it should say "We don't really know anything because we don't have all the facts." instead of the gotcha headlines and such about Obama targeting them. 




 Armor piercing ammunition

18 U.S.C.,  921(a)(17)(B)


    A projectile or projectile core which may be used in a handgun and which is constructed entirely (excluding the presence of traces of other substances) from one or a combination of tungsten alloys, steel, iron, brass, bronze, beryllium copper, or depleted uranium; or

     
    A full jacketed projectile larger than .22 caliber designed and intended for use in a handgun and whose jacket has a weight of more than 25 percent of the total weight of the projectile.


The term armor piercing ammunition does not include shotgun shot required by Federal or State environmental or game regulations for hunting purposes, a frangible projectile designed for target shooting, a projectile which the Attorney General finds is primarily intended to be used for sporting purposes, or any other projectile or projectile core which the Attorney General finds is intended to be used for industrial purposes, including a charge used in an oil and gas well perforating device.


----

The ATF isn't extending, it is interpreting based on existing law what fits into the law. Your link has a link in it to the PDF of the technical reasons laid out as to why they are suggesting the change and I am guessing they are required to allot time for the public to comment on it - so letting the comment period last '5 minutes' would have been a wrong move for them.

Further, in the PDF, you will note that they have been getting a lot more requests, since 2011, for exemptions to the rule - hence their desire to clarify the rule and make it more simple in it's application. Again - this is a proposal which is open for comment on their ideals. 

This reminds me of when there was proposal about kids doing some work on farms and there was a proposal period open for discussion on restricting certain things. The right waited till the comment period was about up and then railed on it claiming Obama was going to forbid kids from helping out on the farm. 

[Barack Obama proposed banning farm kids from doing basic chores, John Thune said](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/29/john-thune/barack-obama-proposed-banning-farm-kids-doing-basi/) 




 Let me help you here: "sounds like it came from" and "because the facts aren't what they claim." go together in a sense. When someone wants to detract from the facts (because they aren't as bad/motivated for x reason) they use a headline to plant a suggestion. 

In this case, in the article it is noted: "The proposal by the A.T.F. to reclassify the rifle ammunition started more than three years ago" and it is also noted: "This is an A.T.F. proposal being considered through its standard process, an official there said. "

The attempt by the right the last few days has been to associate Obama himself with this to prop up their failed propaganda in 2008 that Obama would ban all guns. So.....any chance they get they make sure "Obama" appears in the headline.

They also don't mention the 1986 law reagan signed and how this is somewhat of an extension of the definitions listed there to keep the law updated and relevant based on it's stated goals.

Overall - some poor journalism and a story being used by the right to whip up their base. I would have more respect if it was simply written as "Here is an ATF proposal, this is comment period, here is the history of it all, if you oppose it let them know" 




 LOL at your title. "PO's Administration" vs the actual title or saying 'The ATF' for example. It's cute - sounds like it came from a not too bright right wing source that has to manipulate emotions because the facts aren't what they claim. 




 And idiot conservatives actually believe that. Which is sad. 




 They use public paid for/subsidized infrastructure so they have to play by some rules. Do you remember the whole debacle re: fiber cabling and how we got screwed on that deal? Time for them to stop milking us and do what they are supposed to - provide internet. We lag behind other countries because companies can't be trusted. And again - we subsidize their efforts and it isn't irrational to apply some rules. 




 So they used the internet to complain? 




 It's reddit. It's politics. 




 How can this be? I thought Obama was a mulsim and was protecting terrorists? Something doesn't add up!! 




 A bush appointee, no shocker there ;) 




 Well, how do we know if they don't ask the questions? I mean - if he grew up with Islam as his religion do you think they would ask if his religion played a part? Maybe he grew up Christian, shouldn't they look at his bible and see what parts he highlighted? 




 So - some white, probably Christian, male killed someone and was found guilty. Wonder if conservatives will mention his race or religion? 




 Sounds like a true genius of science right there. Must be a conservative. And why wash it out? Just pray it away - I mean prayer is what the republicans want to replace the aca with anyway. 




 I would sit on them too - the republican bills usually read like: "We will allocate funds for highways to create jobs. Also, Obama has to admit he is responsible for Benghazi and food stamps are to be cut 75% to fund a tax break for banks" 




 So, the repubs, knowing he would veto, spent the time and energy anyway on this - yet failed, for years, to push through spending on bridges/roads/etc (at least a clean version of such).

Well, back to Benghazi hearings for them - might as well waste more time and money. It is what they seem to do best. 




 She can attack me anytime. We'll see if she can wield my hammer. Git r done! (yes, somewhat sarcastic there folks and satiric). 




 "Imported"? Did the admin buy them online? 




 BRB have to get my Rainbow Brite doll out of the closet. 




 The criteria is whether you could perform the job if you had it, not whether or not you have a job. Your "past relevant work" is defined as any work you performed on a substantial basis during the past 15 years. The Analyst will assess your Residual Functional Capacity (RFC), which indicates what functions you are able to perform despite your disability. You will be classified as to whether you are capable of doing sedentary, light, medium, heavy, or very heavy work. Your RFC will then be compared to the requirements of your past jobs. This is why it is very important to list all of the physical and mental requirements of jobs on your Work History that you are no longer able to perform. 

https://sp-foundation.org/social-security-disability-insurance-ssdi-and-supplemental-security-income-ssi/#disabled-def

It can play a factor. I think what many don't understand is the complexity of the term 'disability' and how it plays out.  




 *To meet our definition of disability, you must not be able to engage in any substantial gainful activity (SGA) because of a medically-determinable physical or mental impairment(s):*

Low earnings, however, don't necessarily establish that you're unable to work. The SSA will consider the circumstances under which work was performed. For example, where a disability applicant had worked as a substitute bus driver, the court found that he was doing SGA because his low earnings did not indicate that he was unable to work and his income was less than it could be because of the on-call nature of the job. The SSA can even consider volunteer activities and criminal activities as SGA if they represent substantial work for which someone would ordiniarily be paid (the agency will not consider hobbies or school attendance to be SGA).

Similarly, high earnings don't necessarily the claimant was doing SGA, if he or she was working under special conditions. Claimants can argue that their income would have been lower but for the fact that the claimant:

http://www.disabilitysecrets.com/sga.html
--------------

People often picture disabled people are being unable to do much of anything, then see them cutting the grass and yell AHA! Cheater! You are doing work! Without understanding the legal definitions of disability. A mental illness is another example. Your meds can have terrible side effects that leave you in bed most of the day for days, then you are a little better and can do more - but you lack consistency to gain employment (again, people won't see you laying in bed sick in your house,but step outside to shovel your walk and they will think you can hold down a full time job). 




 With republicans in charge you can expect that money will be shifted to corporations that want it or weapons. 

The problems with the fund have known about for last two decades and congress has been too lazy to fix it - the right will claim the problem is from lazy moochers/etc and not congress screwing around. And it will play with their base who don't understand what ssdi actually is (ever hear one say "I know someone on ssdi, he can work!"? They always fail to understand how the term disability is applied and you ability to do what you were doing, etc).

So yes - be worried, the vets will cry out and soften the blow because the right loves soldiers wounded in wars they lied them into, but they will use this time to try to force cut backs. 




 Well, the right is always whining about how they want the government to be run like a corporation. So guessing they support this fully. 




 So just like regular police who have similar choices. How many cops don't arrest people who have been drinking and driving? More than cops who arrest everyone who drinks and drive. Fox news, it isn't for the bright people of the world. 




 I think the "no weapons" part is aimed at them not finding things like camel pox/etc that they claimed were there. I don't see any weapons in the article that were a threat to the US. But hey, we can say we went to war over 400 rockets and some of them from the 80's had sarin - and it stills sound like shit. 




 Do you go fishing there? What kind of motor you use on your boat, a trolling motor? 




 From earlier:

North Carolina man charged in shooting death of three people

Police charged a North Carolina man with three counts of first-degree murder in the shooting deaths of three people outside the University of North Carolina.

Carl Stephen Hicks, 46, is accused of killing two Chapel Hill, N.C. residents Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, and his wife Yusor Mohammad, 21, and her sister Rzan Mohammad Abu-Salha, a Raleigh, N.C. resident, the Chapel Hill Police Department said in a statement.

Both Barakat and Mohammad were students at the University of North Carolina. Mohammad Abu-Salha was studying at North Carolina State University.  




 Nice, about time - twitter folks were hammering on it :) 




 New website (registered last month), new twitter, FB - and a story written to sucker in conservatives by someone named lana whom the editor now claims has been hired to write for them.  Yeah....right. It has been all over right wing sites - mission accomplished. 




 Interesting, fox has it now as well, no mention of 'muslim' (*puts on shocked face*)

http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/02/11/north-carolina-man-charged-in-shooting-death-three-people/ 




 [America, fuck yeah.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R5A0pg4oN8)
 




 Sooo. The rw'ers believe there was some discrimination going on in this case by some dude with a gun because the perp was muslim but fight tooth and nail here in the US whenever someone says a crime was a hate crime ("Crimes are all hate crimes", "you only see hate involved in that killing because the victim was gay in a gay friendly store", etc). Suck it up buttercups. 




 The website was set up last month, same with twitter/fb account, they have now 'hired' the 'author' who wrote that. Yeah....I smell BS and they trolled the right and got lots of web traffic. They knew conservatives would just believe it. Well played webmaster. 




 Good. I know conservatives won't like it - they think you should just accept any action by someone in government and have no means to speak out if things go wrong. But people in the real world like the idea of the government having a place where people can inquire about issues they encounter with government agencies. Maybe if Bush gets elected he will please conservatives and insist that no complaints be communicated and you just take it. 




 Naw, I think the point is that if rw'ers here want to blame all of islam for what some who follow it do they should be consistent and see the mote/log in their own eye and blame all christians for what some christians here did. That they aren't is rather telling. 




 Weird, don't all military people hate libs because they are all cons?

*He enlisted in the US Marine Corps Reserve after graduating with a degree in political science and spent the summer between college and law school at boot camp. Although his childhood vision of being a fighter pilot was waylaid by not having the eyesight to match the dream, Judge Butterfield was activated during his final year at Willamette University College of Law by the Marines for duty in the (first) Persian Gulf War. He served as a combat engineer in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and finished as a sergeant in 1994.*

What's your next trick, telling people marines are for taking pics up little girls' skirts? 




 Naked Amish dudes swimming in the sea of Galilee....there's a pic you can't get out of your head. 




 why are you spamming that link to every thread on the issue? 




 The same people whining about this probably were recently telling people "American Sniper" is just a movie, deal with it. 




 Would you like them to add some unicorns and little ponies to the story for you? 
























 I was gonna vote for Hillary. Then I died. 




 He isn't using it right. I follow 700 news org in one list and it tells me a lot :) 




 We report, you decide ;) 




 Could you autograph that pic using the sharpie in your ass? Cause that would be freakin awesome. 




 I'll be waiting on my check. I can't vote for her though - she was born in kenya (FACT!) and she promised to take away every gun in America and change us over to Sharia law. 

Yeah. I made all that up. But put it on a website and post it around the net and people on the right will just believe it without thinking. 




 I'm gonna write my own bible, the Chance-a-Sutra. It will have a lot of pictures, including some with guns in them. Can't wait to pass it out at schools there. 




 More than 2,100 paratroopers took place in the operation.

The 82nd Airborne Division conducts thousands of airborne operations each year. Exiting an aircraft in flight with a full combat equipment load comes with inherent risks, but we take prudent precautions to minimize potential injuries, Wilkinson said.

 *Koonin's main point was that humans, together with nature, are now determining the evolution of the Earth's climate, Rosner said. "That is amazing, and given the difficulties we have in managing our affairs, also very scary," he said.*

*"It is time to move on from the fake debate over whether climate change is real or poses a risk, and onto the worthy debate about what actions we must take to avoid a climate catastrophe," he said in an email.*

Well stated - something I am betting many on the right will miss in the whole article. 




 Hannity is pimping this fake story as well - but considering the rw'ers who listen to him I can see why he would. They question nothing and just blindly believe anything (hmmm and many on the right are religious isis like fundies as well....)

Anyway - Obama is planning on letting them fly here in stolen Libyan jets after the isis folks have been exposed to ebola and finished training mexican kids to bring with them for terror attacks. 

Mexican authorities at Taco Bell told me all about Obama's plan. 




 I just thought "5 black guys" was the name of a new burger joint... 




 Yeah....blah blah blah. Obama will take all your guns, crash stock market, destroy America, he is a kenyan born muslim, he will put christians in fema camps, etc.

The right seems to be wrong. A lot. But not one has the guts to ever admit it, do they? I might take their criticism of hillary more seriously if they didn't make up things and fail to own them when they are proven wrong.

Waaah...What is hillary gonna do? Same things the right swore Obama would? ROFL. OK....we believe you. 




 Number 1 answer: "I am conservative who thinks gays are causing god to punish us, that we need more religion in our laws, more wars, less taxes and more money for defense and israel" 




 LOL OMG. You dredge up some old old old newspaper article?

Hillary owns the mind of the right. It is a beautiful thing to behold how she has them all running around.  




 Ohhhh. Rubio...Yeah. This guy:

He criticized judges who are redefining marriage from the bench, claiming that pro-marriage-equality decisions take away the rights of Americans like myself who oppose same-sex marriage: Those who support same-sex marriage have a right to lobby their state legislature to change its laws. But Americans like myself who support keeping the traditional definition of marriage also have the right to work to keep the traditional definition of marriage in our laws without seeing them overturned by a judge.

Calling tolerance a two-way street, he lamented that today there is a growing intolerance on this issue, intolerance towards those who continue to support traditional marriage.

The Florida Family Policy Council announced today that it will host *Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) at its 2013 Annual Dinner. The FFPC is led by John Stemberger, the anti-gay activist who most recently helped launch a Boy Scouts splinter group that will ban openly gay youth, and the fundraiser will honor Liberty Counsel head Mat Staver.* 




 Who is he? Didn't his dad invent the Rubio's cube, or Marco Polo game, or something? 




 Not everyone has time to read all the questions everyday so there will invariably be duplicates. 




 Hey, don't give away our secrets or they will ban that too! 




 Or take it to work and put it in the water cooler. 




 It's funny how the right sees all of this.

God is mad over two men kissing - but he doesn't care at all about wars, murders, robberies, rapes, cops shooting and beating people, poor people starving or not getting health care, putting as many people in prison as you can, etc and so on.

No...all he is mad about is gays and economic policies where you try to help out those in need.

Conservative fundies...they make no sense. 




 I used to vote republican. Up until 2004. Now they are so far gone I don't think I will ever, in my lifetime, even consider voting for them. 

But, either way, they are losing the culture war. Their regressive, religious, policies keep getting beaten. 

Consider this. The right complains about ISIS/Fundie muslims all the time. The reason? Because those groups aren't as progressives as they say Christians now are. Think about that. They are actually saying progressive changes are good and regressive fundies (the muslim ones) are evil/bad.

Maybe, just maybe, they will run with that and move to being even more progressive....now that they use the term 'progressive' in a positive light. I won't hold my breath, but what they rail against is, to some extent, what they are here in the US. Regressive. 




 Indeed. In fact, it from one of their playbooks:
1. Cut unemployment benefits because people getting them are milking the system and not getting jobs.

2. Shoot down proposals to spur job creation.

3. Complain that, because of Obama there are no jobs. Blame Obama and the unemployed.

4. Claim to have a solution - cut even more benefits (food stamps) and decrease taxes on the rich so they can create more jobs (oddly enough, again, admitting there aren't enough jobs but cutting benefits anyway and calling those in need lazy welfare bums).

Not much they do makes sense. But then, folks like rush and such wanted America to fail so they can blame Obama and tell people 'told you so' for electing Obama (the old fundie idea of punishing 'sinners')

Conservatives....they want to break America for some reason (and yet, they have failed to do so the last 8 years, which makes them sad). 




 I prefer local talk radio (and have worked in some radio over the years and did my own show). One of my fav stations here for many years have been over taken by beck/rush/hannity/levin. Yeah, there are other stations locally but none I have found that are mostly local talk.

Local issues don't get enough play. One of the guys that had a show here moved onto 700wlw so I pick him up there but still not really 'local' anymore (same state). 

Add into the mix how difficult it is to get a license and choices plummet (our show was on pirate radio). Big companies buy up the spectrum and keep out competing stations. 




 *Really to believe that 5 million Jews know better than 6 billion people of the world?* 

It isn't just Jews in Israel. It's republicans here in the US who put god/bible/Israel ahead of country. 

They worship Israel, hate gays, etc all because they fear what god might do to 'murica (they ignore crime, wars, adultery, eating bacon, screwing over the poor and those in prison, etc).

We have our own little isis like group in the US that vote for and push for laws based on religion and will toss this country aside for another country that runs itself based on religion. 




 I don't expect a lot from various subreddits :) but one would think fellow humans participating wouldn't be so...well, dumb or transparent. 




 I lived there for a spell. It is the armpit of CA. Sooo glad to be away from there. Ridgecrest and Tehachapi were much better places IMHO. 




 Apparently. I can think of whole news orgs that annoy me ;) 




 Maybe it is because she is running the youtube server from her home? Benghazi!!! 




 Because this was an action by a government official and not some random kid. 




 It's not like it could hurt him any.... 




 He was also born in kenya, had a fake BC, took away all the guns in the US, allowed ebola to spread and kill millions of Americans, crashed the stock market, sold out the US to muslims for a caliphate....etc.

And this is what pisses people off? LOL. 




 This is an update to some earlier stories, now with video and more information. 




 Well, is it legal like moving your HQ to another country to avoid taxes? If so, how can anyone complain about it. I am sure there won't be any republicans or conservatives who will complain that the Obama's operated within the law for their own benefit. 

PS - no, I am not upset with Obama here since he exercised a right other parents have as well. 




 I bet, because he said that, conservatives won't vote for Hillary. Damn, that man sure is powerful and intelligent! "Don't trust someone I don't like!" because, you know, before all republicans did.

Gonna be a long, dumb, campaign season. 




 Hmmm "thepunditpress". Let's see how conservatives will view something like this.

Guessing: It will make them say things like "See!! It's all fake, no one has ever mistreated a black/muslim/woman/gay person. This is why I am SMART and don't trust people!"

But then, someone posts a story where a cop shoots an unarmed American citizen, and it's on video. Suddenly..."So, one bad apple! You can't judge all cops by this. If a cop says he shot someone I got his back and won't just assume he/she is lying!"

Cons..... 




 If Bush and Clinton ran together they would be unstoppable. The, after 8 years Chelsea and another Bush could run together. 

It would be like Kang and Kodos. The two families could rule the earth together forever. 




 It cooks faster than in a conventional oven. 




 Is this your 'I am going to pretend to be a smart person but really gonna act like a conservative' account? What is your brilliant analysis of the left's agenda? That they treat fellow humans in a more decent way than rw fundies? Dang, that's a plain awful thing right there. Damned libruls! 




 It's gonna be a fun 8 years with her as president. I don't like her myself, but man o man cons hate her. I can see why, after 8 glorious years of bill and her in the white house they ended up with bush who screwed up everything. From 9/11 to wars to recessions. 

Then a dem black man takes over and fixes the messes bush made. Republicans are just pining for those wonderful bush years again. Go Jeb.... 




 Here's the video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uY7gLZDmn4 feature=youtu.be 




 Looks like you signed up with that name just to bash ole hillary. Or troll. Either way, your argument doesn't make any sense. Hillary may be to the right of your President, Obama, but she is left of the loons running as republicans. Are you one of them 'purists' or just conservative who is pretending to be 'concerned'? 




 Well, if they are a woman, holding open a door will ruin their day from what I have been told. Benevolent sexism. Every once in a while I hold open a door or do something nice for a woman just to ruin their day. Oddly, many smile and thank me - but that just tells me they are mental slaves of the patriarchy. Or something like that. 




 Republicans are the whiniest group of people I have ever met. "WAAAH he is meeting with some human being I don't like instead of killing him all the men/women/children in a country I don't like because they don't think like me! I wanna control them. Me me me!"

That about sums up the foreign policy of conservatives.  




 This man is just too stupid to be president. 




 I was one. There were some decent folks on the force but overall there was an atmosphere of corruption and people who let power get to their head. I don't regret leaving there (back in the 80's).

Cops will stab other cops in the back first chance they get to save themselves. I was a friend with the sheriff before I worked there and became friends with the lt. of Internal Affairs (all cops hate IA....). This upset other deputies. You don't want to get on the bad side of those directly above you - they come together and can make your life hell.

We used to tie up some inmates, face down, arms pulled up behind their backs, and leave them like that 45 minutes or so till they were in so much pain they were crying. My senior officer on floor with me one night (mostly worked in the main jail) sat and watched a guy hang himself - we cut him down in time, but he told me not to interfere and let him do it if he wanted. 

There is a corrupt culture and a good old boy's network - but, yeah, there are some good cops. Problem is they fight an uphill battle against the system.  




 Depends on your personality and age. When I was a young man I read "Follow My Leader" 14 times (about a kid who goes blind - oddly enough he was named Jimmy Carter). Then there was The Dark Is Rising series by Susan Cooper.

Sci-Fi? Start with and oldie like Rendezvous With Rama - not too intense but interesting and easy read, and fun.

Just a few personal suggestions :) 




 Criminal? What has she been convicted of? I missed it. 




 Call Palin, because she could shoot at the Russians from her back porch. 




 Perhaps that is indeed the case. But at some point we have to deal with today and what is going on instead of letting either party get away with "They did it before so it's our turn to screw things up."

As a citizen I say "Yep, you both have been dicks and held up progress at times. Now get to work and earn your damned pay check and fill the positions we need. Slackers." 




 4chan: Already when back in time and told some woman she would have a baby and to name him Jesus. Then they snuck him out of his tomb later and wandered around dressed up as him.

Reddit: Figured it out and created /r/Atheism to combat their evil plans.

Tumblr: Went back in time and helped created boy bands who can't play a tune but make them feel special - which ended the real rock and roll era and broke up what was once a new, amazing band, comprised of members of The Who, Rolling Stones, and The Beatles.  




 From her FB page:

Good LA Times story about the immigration reform bills I've introduced. Two things not mentioned in the story: Legal permanent resident are being deported, as well. And not only do several states use the pretrial diversion system my bills would adopt, California did, as well, until the legislature changed it as part of the costly, failed, War on Drugs whose consequences we are still working through. 




 Because she doesn't want to see the American isis like party back in control pushing their religious agenda?

Or, maybe, she is like Romney and feels she deserves the job and wants the power that goes with it. She liked being in the whitehouse and all the attention/power it had which is why she carpetbagged a senate gig.

I don't like her myself but I would vote for her over anyone running on the right (unless huntsman were to try again). Big business will end up with the two candidates they want the most and the rest of us will pick one for them. 




 Try looking at it from the view of an investor. You put $x into a company and you push to get as much back out as you can. 

You start a company (investing your time/money) and want to get the most you can from your investment.

People cheer that on. Until the people doing the actual labor (investing their time, and even money on a car, gas, clothes) want more. Then suddenly people talk about 'greed' and how awful it is. 

Prices go up all the time because the first two groups want more. They lay off people, shift jobs to Vietnam, etc, just to grab a few more dollars. But when workers want a bit more of the wealth they are helping to create folks get bent out of shape and pine for the glory days of the early 1800's. 

All of these years of having a min wage and the right still says we are the greatest country on earth, most innovative, wealthiest country, etc. Maybe it isn't the big boogeyman people have made it out to be after all. 




 Also, worth noting, this is based off of 233 businesses. They sent questionnaires to 1000 and 233 replied. What's the over/under on businesses downsizing at anyone one time in Oakland? You can read the study at the link. Not what I would call 'well done'. Heck, it could be worse than that. Could be better. 

I wouldn't be opposed to a more Scandinavian model, tiered min wage based on age.  




 Here, let me help some folks out:

Back when we started NAFTA (and now, maybe TPP) what people tell you is "Yes, in the short term there will be job losses but long term there will be gains" (of course, the people who lost jobs back then were called lazy, etc, by the right and then when they did finally got jobs had lost seniority, etc, and so on).

Anywho...this will all pan out in the long run. More people with more money spread a tiny bit more evenly. People have whined about the min wage since I was 18 and making 3.35/hr and the country is still going strong. 




 All of the others aren't the topic of conversation right now. I actually don't watch much news (I use a twitter list w/every tv news station in the US, etc).

One might also find your posting rather spammish as you posted it, what, like 4 places at once? And you obviously agree with the content so I wouldn't guess you would be a good peer reviewer of fox news ;) 




 People don't jump on fox without cause.

It was, for fox, a decently written article. But note the use of the word 'activists' (5 times) and how and when in the past they have used that term. In the article they state: *Though Lomax is tied to the oil-and-gas industry* note they aren't calling him any sort of 'activist'. 

Fox didn't question the author worth a damn. They basically just reposted what he said without 'peer reviewing' him. Now, as far as the peer reviewing- they don't even explain what it is or how it works, which may sound silly. Until you think about this:

**The journal's editors send the article to several other scientists who work in the same field (i.e., the "peers" of peer review). Those reviewers provide feedback on the article and tell the editor whether or not they think the study is of high enough quality to be published.**

So peers review the data. And in this case, where one could make an issue with the data, is in who collected it (which is outlined in the actual paper). But that doesn't detract from the actual paper or the findings about the air samples. Other people who have done similar research reviewed the paper and found it acceptable. 

If, in fact, you read what the peers wrote you will see that they had questions themselves about some things. One reviewer states that air testing near such operations is very difficult and this is not a final answer but is valuable because it assesses areas identified by the public. All of them offered revisions and had some questions. 

None of this was expanded upon by fox, discussed, etc. Thei 'journalism' was basically reposting and asking a few pointed questions to the reviewers. Basically - typical fox clickbait that doesn't require a person to think. 




 Was the password 'Pencil'? 




 "obama WILL ban ALL your guns!"

Yeah. Never happened. 




 Ok...yeah. So? Is there a point you are trying to make? If so. What is it? 




 Betting cons will believe Iran over our president. The same cons who before were telling us Iran lies all the time. 




 You mean like in the bible, where it says you can handle them without fear? Oh wait - I forgot, god only protects from snakes, for everything else we use bullets and bombs because we don't trust god (though the right is pretty certain god will personally attack america for letting gay people marry -using hurricanes, floods, etc). 




 Yeah, I think the right is going to call for 15 investigations and millions of our taxpayer dollars to investigate this. It's the only way to be sure! 




 Cons seem to get a lot wrong. Climate. Iraq. Obama was born in Kenya. No shock that the tea party takeover has just added to their problems. 




 Being #1 doesn't always mean you're better, it could just mean a lot of people blindly listen to your crap. 

Kind of like cons probably listen to some crappy boy band and yell about how they are better than the Who ever was and proudly proclaim "My group is #1 right now, it means something!" 




 Obama told the truth about where he was born and cons are still whining like babies about it saying he lied.

Telling the truth gets you nowhere with the party of whiners. 




 *Also, what is a Koran defector?*

An ex-muslim from korea? 




 Do people there have dvd players? 




 And what I posted:
http://mediamatters.org/research/2009/04/09/media-conservatives-fearmongering-obama-will-ta/149054

None of what proposed would ban/take away all guns - which is what people were claiming. Even in 2013 he didn't try to take away guns, he supported the AWB back in 2004 (so nothing new there).

He did not try to, nor ever said he would, take away all the guns.  




 This one? Which ones was it gonna ban?

Proposed Congressional Actions

    Requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales, including those by private sellers that currently are exempt.
    Reinstating and strengthening the ban on assault weapons that was in place from 1994 to 2004.
    Limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds.
    Banning the possession of armor-piercing bullets by anyone other than members of the military and law enforcement.
    Increasing criminal penalties for "straw purchasers," people who pass the required background check to buy a gun on behalf of someone else.
    Acting on a $4 billion administration proposal to help keep 15,000 police officers on the street.
    Confirming President Obama's nominee for director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
    Eliminating a restriction that requires the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to allow the importation of weapons that are more than 50 years old.
    Financing programs to train more police officers, first responders and school officials on how to respond to active armed attacks.
    Provide additional $20 million to help expand the a system that tracks violent deaths across the nation from 18 states to 50 states.
    Providing $30 million in grants to states to help schools develop emergency response plans.
    Providing financing to expand mental health programs for young people.  




 No more that I can see, can't recall every hearing of this before - since they are covering it later on the news they may update the article later. 




 This can't be right. Conservatives assured us in 2008 Obama would take away all guns. Not that he wanted to, not that he said he would, but that he would in fact do it. Not sure how, but apparently the right understands government better than the rest of us.

Then in 2012 they said the same thing, that he was just waiting until his second term to ban them all. Again, no mention of how he could but were told he would.

Apparently they were wrong. Again. And still no one will own up to the lies and hype. Benghazi!! 




 I am still waiting for you to explain your post. Did folks here like my op or not? (checks the karma on it...957) so...anyway, you were whining about what again?

I think you are just trolling, as I said before, and it appears I was right and I win. Concede any time you want -unless, as I said, you are trolling.

Either way. You lost. I love the smell of trolls roasting in the morning.  




 Ohhh, I like that :)

You threw in the whole porn thing, which is supposed to mean...I dunno, what? Maybe you are projecting here.

What the heck is a wank licker? it is obviously something you know about. Please, be an adult and enlighten us.

All this fuss over one pic - apparently you are greatly upset over it all. Please, enlighten us all as to why. All I did was post a pic from some news source and you are completely upset about it - how did this all happen? It must mean a great deal to you. I am just not sure why. 




 So sorry...but apparently a lot of other people didn't agree with you on whether or not it was an interesting post.

What - are you some sort of religious purist and you think you are the sole arbiter of what is or isn't interesting here?

Yeah...No. Maybe, just maybe, not everyone is you. There are a lot of interesting things out there that make people go "wtf?" - And your attempt to make it all about you and what you like isn't going so well. 




 Apparently folks actually appreciated my post. Why does that bother you so much? I don't get it.

I care about link karma because I actually care about posting things that people might enjoy reading. I don't care about comment karma. 

Seriously - maybe I am totally off on things. Is there something I am missing here? Why are you and a few others so upset with an interesting post? I am trying to understand it- I am just not seeing it.

I have no reason to 'defend' myself to anyone for anything. Seriously? Is your life so sad/bad that this is something you are willing to get all upset about?

Fun thread, interesting topic, and your are focusing on me in it all? I think you have issues beyond what I can help with. 




 Oh...I'm sorry...downvotes?

Is that something you personally track? How many votes does this thread have?

Yeah. And how much link Karma do you have compared to me?

Yeah. I thought so :)

You were saying? 




 It's a damned shame how people act at times :) I upvoted your reply because I think it is genuine and honest. 

It is really sad that I regret posting something I thought people might enjoy. I was gonna post it in news (where I usually post) but didn't see it as a news story, so I posted it where I thought appropriate.

Out of all the things I have posted in 2 years on reddit I don't think I have ever posted something where I have gotten so much hate. 

All over a pic...sheesh. I get why some people rant about reddit now. But - hell, I will keep doing what I do and screw the haters - it isn't like I will get a check in the mail or gold/etc anyway :) 




 Yeah...no. You're failing in that. But it's ok. 

"When I see" is a rather broad definition. I saw it in a news story, posted it. And all you are able to contribute to this thread is whining about me?

Heh. I'll give you a 8/10 on the trolling front - because I am enjoying it.

Keep trying, I think we can bump you up to a 9/10 if you play it right.  




 Where did I imply that I did?  Can you point that out to me?

I bet you can't. 




 Yeah, well...tell that to the folks over there kicking my ass for some reason over it all.

On the other hand, don't bother. I think they are either just trolling or butthurt about something.

I really don't get some areas of reddit at times. I try to find interesting things for folks, don't ask for upvotes, gold, etc, just try to post links people might find interesting and get nothing for it - and for some odd reason some want to kick my ass for it.

Meh. Screw em. Tomorrow they will forget my name and so will I lol. 




 That's so cute!

Yes, when I see a big cat dragging a shark out of the water is WTF worthy. I guess you see that each day and it doesn't elicit a response from you.

Who knew. Hey...how about you post all the pics of that happening you probably have? Go ahead...I'll wait.  




 LOL - well, apparently, some people in my thread think I 'stole' the thread from someone. I don't get it....I honestly didn't see yours or the other thread when I posted mine. I monitor about 700 news sources on twitter/etc and saw this and thought it was interesting, but a few people in my thread are on some sort of down voting spree over it all.

http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/31selr/bobcat_dragging_shark_out_of_sea/

God...I hope my life never becomes that lame. I mean, it's lame right now, but I don't go around whining about people posting something I posted (and kudos to you for not being a jerk about it).

 




 Does this one post of mine to reddit, out of all the ones I have made, upset a few folks this much?

Maybe I am not the one acting like a 14 yr old here. 




 "All (  only) things that make you say WTF." - and that pic/story made me say "WTF?" when I saw it.

So...do I understand it or do you have some other interpretation you would like to share? 




 I posted the other thread, didn't see yours at the time :) For some odd reason that pissed off a few people....Sometimes, I just don't understand the internet. 




 That's cool. You must be a conservative. How ya doing? See any good movies lately? 

You know, I have always wanted to be one of the "you people" crowd. Funny how easy it is to get such a designation. 




 Indeed, that is when facebook is forcing all the apps to change their API to new platform. 




 No, I got it from a news outlet. I never claimed it was my photo. 




 My friends at a christian bakery snuck me out through their closet :) 




 Guess not all of us lead a life where we are refreshing a wbepage every few minutes. Go you. 




 Could be. We need a full investigation - where is Issa when we need him to look into things like this?? 




 That was a horrible movie. I like end of the world style movies so I sucked it up and watched it.

Now I did enjoy The Remaining:  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2714380/

It sucked, but in a Plan 9 From Outer Space way. It was a hoot. IMHO, best ever movie about the end times with a christian twist to it. Left behind was just a HORRID movie. Not even one I can watch for fun. The story line was god awful, that whole thing with his daughter, etc...good lord it just sucked so bad it made me wish the end was here. 




 I think it was caused by god as punishment against gay bakeries...or something like that.

 Well, it is better on tap than from amazon :) 




 LOL. Yep. Just like Obama was going to take away all the guns (never said he would, never happened), he was gonna crash the stock market, would ignore ebola and we would all die from it....etc.

The right will believe anything :) 




 It's great in coffee. Or, uh, so I hear. 




 Yep, I was gonna reply "Gamer". :) 




 If I may:

I understand all too well the conditioning. And then there is the history, and community, and perhaps biggest of all, acceptance by others (family, friends, etc).

What you wanted, in being a wise old jewish man on a mountain, was a sense of purpose and knowledge that you thought perhaps would help not only you but also others (I don't know, speculating).

You existed in a framework. And you wanted to do well within that framework. 

Now I would like to look at it from a different view for a moment - in part because just the other night on fedflix (old govt movies) I watched a show about Jews in Chicago, made by the police department.

I ventured to guess, while watching it, that there were probably some in the Jewish community who weren't really believers (at least to some extent). But that they knew and understood the importance of culture and history and the things which tie people together. Sure - maybe moses never existed, but the traditions passed down had a net positive influence so such things were worth keeping and celebrating because of the larger lessons they conveyed.

Religion is a mufti-facteted thing and sometimes leaders see that even when they don't believe in the facts of story. There is worth in a common past, those experiences can be celebrated, understood, and carried on. Not always my cup of tea of course :)

Anyway, sorry if I am off the mark, I am personally dealing with a lot myself in this arena (though not from a jewish perspective). 




 What is it you are debating actually? That there can't be anything higher than humans? That something you can't see can't possibly exist? That the only things which can be are the things we can see and understand with our current technology?

Logically, such debates aren't even really debates. The more we learn the more we realize there is that we don't know. It would be like complaining that theoretical physicists and things they talk about are bunk because they haven't been proven. Proof requires the ability to prove things which may be currently beyond our physical capabilities. You don't discard such things out of hand but try to understand how the theories came to be, are they plausible, etc and so on.

Agnostics are the theoretical branch, imho, of atheism. 




 The point is there doesn't have to be a point. As humans we discuss a great many things and disagree on them. Sports, for example. I can easily get into a debate about the Buckeyes being better than other teams (which I have done a lot of....) when it comes to football. It won't matter in the end but people have views on things and shit happens.

Now, as to 'those who can't be reasoned with' I would tend to disagree on that in a broad sense. Sure, right now they can't, but part of that is because few challenge them directly. Popping the bubble people live in isn't usually a one time affair. But the more they see that others aren't like them (on beliefs/etc) the more their bubble is altered. 

A door opened a crack today by you could be opened a bit more tomorrow by someone else. I wouldn't say it is a goal to change the mind of people but to open the minds of others to help them better determine for themselves certain things.

Ignorance, on many things, hurts us all, and picking up even little bits of 'education' on something here and there can lead to better things down the road.  




 I agree. 




 They were elected to stop the policies of Barack Obama and the Democrat Party, Limbaugh asserted. Unfortunately, however, Republicans are making it clear that they intend on working together with Democrats and the president to get things done, particularly Obamas free trade agenda.

Ive got a lot of members who believe that international trade agreements are a winner for America and the president and I discussed that right before I came over here, said Senator McConnell, who among other Republicans, shares Obamas vision about the trade partnerships. I think hes interested in moving forward. I said, Send us trade agreements; were anxious to look at them.

Even Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has voiced his support for the trade agreements, encouraging the president to prioritize passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Speaking at the Center for the National Interest dinner in New York City on October 23, Senator Paul said:

Our national power is a function of the national economy. During the Reagan renaissance, our strength in the world reflected our successful economy.

Low growth, high unemployment, and big deficits have undercut our influence in the world. Americans have suffered real consequences from a weak economy.

President George W. Bush understood that part of the projection of American power is the exporting of American goods and culture. His administration successfully brokered fourteen new free trade agreements and negotiated three others that are the only new free trade agreements approved since President Obama took office. Instead of just talking about a so-called pivot to Asia, the Obama administration should prioritize negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership by years end.

 Let's just start a rumor that it stops discrimination against gays and prevents Iran from getting a nuke, and that Obama is 100% for it all. The right won't even look into it and organize against it, including setting up a gofundme for the pizzaparlorSuperPac. 




 So what? They are investors. They don't work, they invest their money and it works for them - the are able to finally do this under Obama. 

Of course the children, those in college, jail, etc probably aren't working, and given how racist the justice system is one can better understand the numbers (Note: conservatives don't think the system is racist at all and, in fact, support more discrimination in America against blacks, muslims, gays, etc). 

And don't worry folks - some republican will campaign on forcing those black folks into the labor force...just like, what to cons, were the 'good ole days'. 




 They like to hire people to look for acorns, shop muslim bakeries, and things like this. 




 I don't think anyone ever accused her of being very bright. Out of the dems in power there are 10-12% who are loons. On the right it is about 65%. And people keep electing both. 




 "Jesus will transform you - suddenly you will hate the poor, push for wars, seek out ways to force his words on others through laws, instead of the healing the sick you shall shame them. Instead of selling all you have and helping others you will set up venture capitalist companies and sell all others have to enrich thyself. The lord will show you that to support our troops you send them die, to support the sick you will turn the other cheek, those in prison you shall laugh at and hope for their misery."

 Find a liquor store and some guns. Hole up there and wait for other cool people who want to drink to do the same. Party on until things calm down. 

In other words, pretty much my current life. 




 Help, help, I'm being repressed :) 




 Not sure how the two are related, except maybe in the mind of a conservative: "I support discrimination and so does Iran, why can't you treat America like Iran? Inconsistent! They are the exact same countries doing the exact same things! If only libtards were as smart us to see that!" 




 Real gross domestic product -- the value of the production of goods and services in the United
States, adjusted for price changes -- increased at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter of
2014, according to the "third" estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.  In the third
quarter, real GDP increased 5.0 percent.

 Basically - the economy is growing under Obama, unlike under Bush - conservatives told us the economy would crash, stock market would plummet, and Obama would take all of our guns. Seems like they got everything wrong. 




 Does that include Liberty University?

 Title was from the twitter feed. 




 I can hear the conservatives now: "See, we got a republican congress and we turned things around......" 




 Hope I win. I had a pet rock once, those are like ponies right? 




 The headline is the story, what else do you want to know - what he was wearing when he signed it? :) 




 "We're bigots and promote discrimination and people don't agree with us on that being a good christian idea! WAAAAAAH" 




 The question is - would I have to bake her a cake?? 




 That was the title when I posted it.  




 Progress always wins. Look at how cons talk about Islam and how regressive it is - even they admit becoming more liberal/progressive is the right way to go.

Sadly, many fundies want to halt and roll back progression to please their god.  




 Odd, it sure seemed to be about current US politics to me. Weird. 




 Here is my problem with free trade and conservatives:

Theory - free trade will help poorer countries grow which will open new markets for the US and spur job growth.

Reality - ok, makes sense....but you forgot something.

What happens is businesses close here and people lose jobs as the first step. Then they lose their house, car, etc. And maybe, just maybe in 5-10 years more jobs will open up. All the while conservatives are yelling at people needing food stamps, unemployment, etc and calling them lazy. And, of course, they are busy union busting so when some jobs do come back you won't be making as much as you were before. 




 They think their job is to go to bat for republicans - they really don't care about the US. 




 LOL ok...now I am a muslim apologist for calling out click bait biased 'journalism'? I am pretty much an atheist and don't have any love for anyones religion. 

This is a blatant attempt from a rw source to feed the feeble minded hatred of an entire group of people that is vastly larger than the few militant idiots here.  




 So, once again, the term 'militants' is there but the headline leaves it out. 

So I guess it would be accurate for me to say "Christians sexually abuse children" when writing an article about some catholics and them covering up abuse?

Or "Christian Nation" (as the rw likes to call the US) starts a war with Iraq. Hundreds of thousands killed by US Christians in search for oil and wmd's..... 




 From the article: "Militants from extremist group Boko Haram" and the headline becomes "Muslims".

Yeah....ok :)  




 Interesting how they use the term 'muslims' here to identify someone. In the US I never see them say "A Christian did x/y/z/". I am guessing the only reason they mention it and care in the first place has something to do with their personal biases. What's next, "Gun owner shoots/robs someone?" No? I wonder why. 




 If I get my membership renewed later this week I will help you out, lvl 100 Necromancer. You just plan on farming the last section with Malistaire or the whole area? 




 Sounds like something a conservative would say. Not true and try to push fear - because, well, facts are pesky things that get in the way of agendas. 




 Troll much?

 Teacher who died in a crash. He crashed into a phone poll which allowed his spirit to tap into the internet/wi-fi - and he used the GPS to kill the guy in the car (but let his wife out first). 




 I found it interesting because a recent episode of Supernatural had pretty much the same thing happen. Someone needs to get Sam and Dean on the case. 




 Never stoop to the student level. Just break out the rifle and duct tape and then tell em you are going to go all nazi on their asses....man, I miss my teaching days, my methods were ahead of their time. Or behind the times. 




 I love the image of Iran the right pushes. Nothing about the caviar sales from there, the tourism, etc - it's like how they played people on iraq and babies/incubators, shredders, and nukes/etc. 

And why are they 'concerned' about Israel? Oh. Yeah. Jesus and the Bible. It's like our own mini isis in the US. 




 Blazing Saddles. 




 What did they do, bring him back from the dead so he could die again? Sounds like something fox would try to do with reagan. 




 But see, rmoney was being a smart business man and we need smart business to run our country just like a business - make profit, cut workers, outsource military, and if people don't like crumbling roads they can drive on someone else's roads. 




 I call it DeadBart because it seems everything is ghost written by someone who hates obama.... 




 You don't need to rally them, they will vote for any republican that hates progress, science, muslims, anyone not white and Christian.

What they need is someone to rally moderates and swing voters.

 Here, cry into my glass so I can add your tears to my vintage bottles from 2008 and 2012. I do so like a glass of those in awhile. 




 Hey, I can't stand the lady myself, but this is a witch hunt. Are you saying the state department is lying that they didn't get everything? 




 Yeah - after the emails were turned over to the state dept and the ones asked for by gowdy were given to them.

 




 So, looks like Boehner is for the TPP as well. For once there is something both the right and the left can bash obama over and the right is quiet as can be. Huh. 




 The butler with the candlestick.  




 Rand Paul, Ron Paul, Ru Paul....what's the difference. We need people with new names. 




 Soldiers have alleged (although the Pentagon has said it cant confirm) at least six U.S. troops died in clashes with the Taliban while hunting for Bergdahl after he went missing and was seized by the Taliban in Paktika province on June 30, 2009.

http://time.com/author/mark-thompson/ 




 She probably wouldn't like my Meat Loaf Mondays or our White Castles Wednesdays :) 




 Wait....what? We funded them for years, because, well, the soviets. We wanted the Taliban. Back then they weren't a 'threat'. They were tools we used. 

And I don't think back then they were going to rush into the USSR anymore than I think they are going to rush into the US. 

I am being honest here - I don't see the big threat to us. Do I think some people can hook up and do terrorist things? Yep. But hell, lone wolf folks here could do a lot more for any number of reasons. 

What, exactly, if you can elucidate on it, scares you about them? 




 Awww....look at you being all scared.

Go ahead, tell us all what these 5 folks are going to do that scares you so much. 

What IS the cost side? What is it you fear and 'believe' they can or will do? Should American's be quaking in their boots over these folks?

Apparently you think these 5 humans, out of 6+ billion, are some huge threat to our country.

Can you detail out how they are such a threat? 




 What is it people think they are going to be able to do? Have a tupperware party and plot to overthrow the US?

5 People, out of the entire population of earth. Now I am sure some might think they can come back and inspire others - but the track record here is the US kills folks like them all the time. 

Maybe the fear people have is that they will use their time and notoriety to influence fundamentalists to jihad - to which I say, I am more worried about the fundies here than there.

Where did the taliban come from? What can these guys actually offer the taliban now? Or is it Al qadea I am supposed to be afraid of now. Or Isis?

Seems there is always someone in the ME that I should be afraid of. I live in Ohio. I am more worried about the Wolverines come football season or the Spartans than some no name guy in the ME who wants to kill someone else in the ME.

Hell, for all I know there some russian guy who pines for the old days and wants to work with some of his comrades to launch a nuke. Really, I am not afraid of 5 guys from the ME who have more of a bone with countries there over Islam than here.

Perspective. We should get it. 




 As far as the last part: *How is that relevant to Bergdahl?*

It goes to the worries and concerns the right seems to have. Really. I am not scared of the people we traded for one of our own. What are they going to do to the US? Nothing. They don't scare me. If I had to put my 'worries' in some order or other, those 5 would fall below my X. Countries and people that have the actual ability to do us real harm (China/Russia) would be high up on the list.

This is about one thing - people who hate Obama and want to use this whole thing for political reasons. 

I see a US soldier, who for whatever reason, was captured and in danger. He is home now. That's one bottom line for me in all of this. I was no fan of Bush, though I voted for him in 2000, but I wouldn't have ripped him a new one for bringing home one of our own. Our soldiers face a lot, sometimes they have issues, but you don't leave em behind. Period. 

Maybe 'patriot' means something different to others. One of our own was captive. We had those guys we traded for awhile and got whatever it is we wanted from them. They were no use to us. It isn't like they are gonna rise up and come over here and whip us. Seriously, there are bigger and worse things to be scared of than them.

But it's all about politics and bashing Obama - I can find a lot better things to bash him over than this.

 




 And you can understand the hype over '5 high ranking' and 'trade', right?

We had a fellow American, a soldier, being held. We kill 'high ranking' al qaeda people every day before breakfast with drones. What, you think those 5 had some sort of magical abilities or something? Ohhh scary people we held. I mean overall, were you one of those people who though Iraq was some huge threat to the US in the first place? 

We traded some losers not from this country for someone who was a US citizen. That is a good trade all day long because I am not really sitting here scared of those folks all day long. 

I'm still more worried about the soviets their nukes because they could actually do something other than yelling allah ackbar while killing each other. 




 (*puts on conservative hat*) Why aren't we using our soldiers to do more of this? Shouldn't our kids, spouses, etc be the ones on the front lines? We need a real president again like Bush who gladly sent our people to do the fighting instead of asking others to do their part. We need to pull up our bootstraps and hand money to other countries and our fellow Americans to die and protect our freedoms from....well, crap, I don't know which of our freedoms is at risk over there right now.

Anyone know? 




 Honestly, I can't answer that. But it does bring up something:

I though Obama threw open the borders and anyone could just walk in here? I mean, republicans have basically said that - so why does this person even need a visa? Is it possible they are just fear mongering (again)?

And I am guessing that the US still has some of the best healthcare in the world on some things. Even Ted Cruz signed up for the ACA :) 




 I think we know why. Gays. God is punishing the US for the most evil of all evils. Gay people. That is why he has sent hurricanes and storms like this. 

Never before in our history have we had to deal with such storms. It was only after the commie liberals starting pushing for gays to be married and allowed to serve their country that god started this. This is why we need to vote for the super smart awesome christian republicans. They can guide us out of the wilderness and strike down the gays for Jesus.

Yeah...might be some sarcasm in that directed at the most backwards people around - Fundamentalists (who all seem to gravitate to 'conservatives' whether here or in the middle east.) 




 So what he is saying is: "Well, there have been many problems for years we blew off, but now that there is the ACA and it's helping people we want to remove it and then we will finally, maybe, do something about the problems we have been ignoring"

Whatever happens, the ACA gave attention to a problem long ignored. Progress. The right can't stop it. From allowing their fellow countrymen/women who are gay serve their country to healthcare to gay marriage - progress marches on. 




 So you wanted Obama to treat him as a criminal before he had a chance to share his side of things? A soldier came home. Now they are saying he is guilty of something. Two separate events that should be treated as such. 




 So as commander in chief you would let someone rot without definitive proof? He could have had mental issues, ptsd, who knows what and your thought is "Screw you, we're leaving you behind on the word of others and without you being able to defend yourself."

Nice. 




 So, basically, you would leave a man behind because of what some people believe? Funny how some people abandon their principles first chance they get. Regardless of how you feel the president has a duty to treat him as a US soldier in good standing until proven otherwise. 




 And he still was convicted of nothing until now. So yeah, I tend to stick to my principles even when they end up maybe not having the best result. Something it seems other are willing to ditch because they never honestly held them in the first place. 




 So you judge people before you look for them?

Hindsight is one thing, and being upset in hindsight is too. But not looking for someone based on hearsay/suspicion is something else. 




 So advisors determine guilt and innocence now without even talking to a person. Ok. Whatever floats your boat :) 




 And the right would rather leave a soldier to rot than bring him home.

It is obvious that they have totally abandoned their principles on this - but hey, remember Darren Wilson and Ferguson? They got upset when people judged him before his day in court. Suddenly they don't care anymore.

 




 They can be upset about that all day long. But they would be upset no matter what he did. If he had left him there to rot because someone said he deserted, without proof and chance to defend himself, and it came out he could have rescued him? The right would be screaming about it.

It goes to principles. Should he have treated the man as innocent first? Would you? Or has that principle went out the window because people hate Obama ? 




 I'll say what I have elsewhere. Obama acted properly and treated him as innocent until proven guilty.

Something I think conservatives used to believe in but are now ditching because of Obama. Funny how that works. Guess they will from here on out never, ever, mention the idea of innocent until proven guilty.

Had it come out that Obama had the chance and did nothing because he believed he deserted than the right would be howling about that too. 




 So you are saying Obama shouldn't have done anything and just accepted the word of others that he was a deserter, without a tribunal, hearing, etc? Without even talking to him (or having others do so)?

And here I thought conservatives had some principles on people being seen as innocent until proven guilty or at least being able to testify on their own behalf.

I am guessing conservatives are abandoning their principles right now to smear Obama. Which means they never really held those principles in the first place. 




 Reminder to the conservatives on this: The man was seen as innocent until proven guilty, and Obama acted in a manor consistent with that.

I am sure that is what is making the cons unhappy now :) 




 SO.....Let me see if I understand this. Obama didn't declare him guilty beforehand, helped get him rescued, and people are upset about this? Same people who were saying D. Wilson shouldn't be seen as guilty till all the facts come out wanted Obama to do the same for this soldier?

Ok.... 




 Stupid to apologize. The right has been 'accusing' Obama of being a muslim as though that is a bad thing. They whine about muslims in politics here all the time.

So how is it a 'slur' in this case? 




 Ah republicans -  they see others as less American and less human because of their race, religion, orientation.  




 Yeah, but we still don't know where the Ark really is. Except that it is in some desert warehouse run by the government. I bet Obama uses it for a footstool!  




 They got the ideas for fines from Cruz and Liberty university :) 




 Conservative view on this (which you can see around the web): 
"Good. Obama is evil and took all our guns. Bibi should be our president and I support any country spying on us. I hate America because the person I wanted to win didn't so I fully endorse foreign nations spying on us. We must support Israel and stop gays here or we will get more deadly hurricanes. 

We should be more like them and how they treat gays and how they handle health care - not like Obama, we need leader like Bibi to hold us cause we are scared of mooslims too! Not to mention baby Jeebus loves Israel and will curse us if we fail to kneel and serve her, Obama is a muslim and doesn't know what the bible says about us serving them!"

---Yep, that pretty sums up the rw and anything Israel/Obama 




 You have to use AT-AT's for that since they can get under the shield ;) 




 My dad's dad died when he was young. He missed his dad. That didn't mean his mom was gonna rush out and marry some guy. 

What is it conservatives are always saying? "Suck it up, pull yourself up by your bootstraps and don't blame others!"

So if you end up with two moms, one, none, whatever - deal with it and do the best you can because they probably are.
 




 Baby steps :) Maybe he is now against gays getting 'stoned' because he thinks god hates pot now and he is just confused. 




 ah yes, fear mongering. Obama will take all your guns, stop parents from allowing kids to do chores, will crash the stock market, destroy america!

Blah blah blah. Still waiting on all the crap people claimed WOULD happen to actually happen. And so far? Not ONE has had the guts to admit they were wrong and apologize for fear mongering.

Israel - beware fundie christians who want to use you for their apocalypse they dream of. 




 So...basically like your run of the mill fundies elsewhere in the world. 

"Oh, look at us, hugging those like us, helping those who profess the same beliefs. And bombing those who don't back to the stone age or being over run by our manifest destiny"

Fundies are their own countries within countries. 




 Woohoo! That guy produces more green house gasses out of his mouth than every farting animal on the planet (I'm looking at you, cows).

I hope he gets the nomination too - that would be classic. 




 According to conservatives only lazy people aren't working - that is why they want to always cut aid. So - according to them, Obama is awesome because everyone can get a job. 




 In the future we will have mated dogs to chickens, then that creation to pigs, and then that one to cows. We will have an awesome food source that gives meat, milk, and eggs all while being potty trained and able to sniff out drugs/bombs. 




 Don't we all ;) 




 Yep. Better stock up now. You could make a killing selling that stuff later. Of course, if you get caught, you could be in a cell next to bubba. "What ya in for?" --  "I sold lip balm!" 




 You seem to run around saying that a lot, and complaining about reddit in general. Maybe the problem isn't reddit.... 




 I did both. Book from the library and the librarian. Man oh man, that reference desk has everything :) 




 Also worth noting: It was national foreign language week. There are a million things to be concerned about these days. Kids learning something new about the world isn't one of them I would put on the short list. 




 Here are my thoughts. When I was in elementary school we had one jewish kid (and 2 black kids) and I don't know if any were atheist or not. But we did have fun Christmas celebrations and plays. And we also learned about Jewish holidays and did activities with that spinny thing made of clay stuff and some candle thingees....

Anyway. Being exposed to actual, real life, cultures and languages that a good chunk of our fellow earthlings are involved in I don't see as a bad thing. It's one thing to read about something in a book and another to hear it/see/etc.

I mean, which would you rather do - learn about sex from a book or from actually doing it? :)

Reality. It's outside the bubble some want to wrap themselves in. 




 No, I am just a prophet. Sometimes when I see a headline I get glimpses of the future (started to happen after sex with a leprechaun). Give it time, rw fundies will be talking about gay lasers.

More Aircraft Laser Incidents Pinned on Gay Club-Goers
http://swiftreport.blogs.com/news/2005/02/more_aircraft_l.html

;) 




 Fox headline will be "Lasers can turn your eye's blue, can they also make you gay?" Then those bright rw congress folks will get scared and try to ban it thinking gay people with laser pointers could be pointing them at your kids and making them gay.

America. Land of the free... and crazy rw'ers who believe gays cause hurricanes and punishments from an invisible sky fairy. You read it here first, gay lasers will be a thing. 




 So they want to ban women from getting ammo? 
























 *Look, American families and small businesses are still struggling.  Many are still asking the question, where are the jobs?  Some Americans are doing better, and frankly thats great news.  But most middle-class families arent seeing the improvement in their daily lives.  So weve got a lot more work to do. "*

And yet he lays out no plans to do this, claims government doesn't create jobs, fights UI extension, wants to cut food stamps, welfare, school lunches. The only plan the republicans ever have is tax cuts for the wealthy, increase defense spending, 'reforming' social security, and pushing a pipeline. All the while ignoring infrastructure.

And he says 'where are the jobs'. Well, I dunno, you said people didn't need a UI extension because it made them lazy and they wouldn't find work - so you must believe there are plenty of jobs for them to work. 




 Yeah, I'm laughing too. 









 Yeah, and it's possible I read /r/gonewild just for the comments. 




 Yet, on the campaign trail, I am sure we will hear him say "Every vote matters!" 




 According to our conservative fundie friends lots of people have been hurt when jeebus sent hurricanes/etc to punish America because of gay marriage. Divorce, murder, rape, wars, ignoring the sick and the poor, etc doesn't bother god. Just gays. 




 Conservatives: "We have had a minimum wage for decades and we believe a few economists when they say it is bad. But we think most scientists are full of shit when it comes to climate change."

Derp. 
































































 Hunh. So they were going to confirm this whole time but wanted to use her for politics.

 Weird, more sites are doing that, I use ghostery and ad blocker and don't see them.

 *shrugs * Ok...so a rw think tank is tracking birth rates for immigrants (hunh, they didn't add 'illegal' to it as a dog whistle for the idjits?)

Can't say I am shocked that a group that advocates for less immigrants is saying this and that a rw rag is picking it up. 

This same group claims *The Center has asserted that there are adverse effects of immigration on the environment* - which is odd because according to the right humans have no affect on the environment and if they do it is ok because 'profit'. "Sure, dumping this waste in the lake kills all the fish and ruins your ability to drink it - but the government shouldn't stop a company from creating jobs!"

 ISIS is filled with religious fundies, so there really isn't a science discussion to be had. To such people it can melt anything if they pray about it before hand and god wills it. Or if they accuse the beams of being gay, in which case (according to religious people in this country who vote republican) got will send storms to destroy the beams and anyone in the building that has such beams. 




 You have to mix it properly with the blood of a virgin (or is it Virginian? Always mix those two up). Not that I know anything about it all, my uh...friend billy told me about it. 




 The Grim Reaper. 














 She knows she won't win. She just wants to get some cred with people. She will use this to trade 'votes' from those who say they back her. She'll endorse the person she thinks will win in exchange for later political position/favors. 




 Think about your avg republican voter here. They don't think or care about such things really. They just want to use deaths for their own gain. 9/11/2001? Support the president or you are a traitor, use the deaths for new laws and wars.

We aren't dealing with rational people who care about the US, they just want to 'win' elections because 'winning' is awesome. When Obama won and they lost they decided to do all they could to destroy that loss, not support him (like they did bush after 9/11), and whine daily about things - including making up things (he was born in kenya, will confiscate all guns, destroy stock market, let ebola kill us all, etc).

It isn't about country for them. I would like one conservative to tell me they honestly care about this country and always did - but that won't happen because what they care about is getting some human, any human on the planet, into office with an (R) after their name. They are mad, sad (sore losers) over 2008/2012 and they care about nothing at all but 'winning' - then suddenly, not matter what or who is in office they will kneel on their flags and open their bibles and just praise them.

Just like they worshiped bush. The greatest man, to them, in the 21st century, who saved America. Yeah...I won't ever make the mistake of voting for a republican in my life again. 




 Funny how the right is so silent on this here. Hmmmm. Maybe they are sick of hearing of it too but don't want to upset their masters (so much courage on the right...when they aren't kneeling down and boot licking). 




  A 14-year-old Mexican girl seized by federal police and sent to a woman in Houston is being returned home after DNA tests showed she is not the woman's daughter.
 
Last week's removal of a screaming Alondra Luna from her middle school last week provoked an outcry from her family, who said authorities ignored proof of her identity. 
 
Federal police said they were acting on a judge's orders to send the girl to Dorotea Garcia, who says the girl had been illegally taken to Mexico by her father years ago. 



















 Religion. Sheesh, can't folks give it all a rest for a bit? "You put carpet down! AHHHHH!" *facepalm* 

No matter where you seem to go in the world there are religious conservative fundies who get all upset over stupid shit. "People are hungry and dying? Wars? Meh. We must not allow desecration in a holy shrine! Where are your priorities!?" 














 He doesn't have the time for that. He has to focus on another benghazi investigation, the most important thing the GOP has going for them. 














 And when Unemployment Benefit Extensions were set to expire where was he? Oh yeah.... 

*Mitch McConnell Laughs at the Unemployed as He Promises to Vote No on UI Benefits* 

But this, this he will fast track. Wonder who owns him? Someone obviously does.

 














 Thanks for the information. 




 Oh, ok. Here is how I view it - there should be outrage whenever government agents/employees kill people. Waco and Ruby Ridge sure as hell got some people up in arms. Ah, but those were white people I guess and the right suddenly cared.

It's not my fault that white cons don't get upset when white people get killed by cops. Maybe that is because, in general, they don't care when cops shoot people. They feel it is always justified. 

If you have some cases where white people were killed/hurt/etc by cops you think should be discussed because you come down on the side of the person being injured by the cops - post em. And I will back the victim of police brutality.  




 They are trying to, they are blaming Obama for the delays. No shocker there. 

I didn't have any issue with them wanting to look into the whole ordeal and get some basic answers. But jeebus, it has gotten downright silly. 

On the other hand, it really does show they have nothing else, at all, when it comes to Obama. They were wrong about him being born in kenya, wrong about him when they said he would crash the market, take all the guns, turn the US into a caliphate, threw open the borders, etc and so on.

They got nothing, and this just is making them look stupid.

You would think there would be some on the right who would see this and tell em to stuff it -but they are too invested now emotionally to act rationally.  









 That got tossed after 9/11/2001, Anthrax, patriot act, tsa, and the Iraq war. 




 Best comment I have seen all day. Upvoted it ;) 









 So does the city/county have to pay him?

Step 1. Speed in reverse
Step 2. Get ticket
Step 3. Profit 




 Well, someone apparently needed to - look, I can be sarcastic too! :) 




 Story isn't big on details, hopefully nothing but if anyone has other info please feel free to add it. 














 If you're in the US (as I am) you probably know our justice system is screwed up beyond all hope. I wish I had answers on how to fix it, but even if I did the system is so screwed no one would implement the fixes. 




 My mom put me on the bus and that was that. Sort of. She became active in the school. Volunteered her time there, got to be good friends with all the teachers and the principal. She and her best friend (whose daughter was my age and lived a few doors down) were at the school a lot and would hang out and smoke in the teacher's lounge, hand out hot chocolate to us kids who did patrol, etc.

A drone would have been easier :) but it had it's perks. I got the teacher I liked each year and me and my friend always got in the same class. 




 MSM is in the business of making money, and they make a lot of it from corporations that advertise on their shows. 

Add in to that the big wigs in these media companies probably own stakes in gas/oil and make more profit if said companies do well (see Sanders and his take on raising royalties on land the govt leases for drilling/etc).

The internet is allowing more and more information to find it's way into the public than ever before - another reason some companies want to have more control over it. 

I don't even have a tv plugged in anywhere but the kitchen, where I like to listen to a show while I cook. News sources for me are a pick and choose online. With twitter I follow every TV news station in the US (about 600 of them total, ignoring some duplicate stations and pbs ones). 

Radio is mostly owned by a few corporations who restrict the local licenses (they buy them up and you can't get one - they let them sit silent to kill competition). The internet is leveling the playing field more and more. 









 I don't have a phone anyway, so good luck to anyone trying to call me at all :) 









 Isis kills more muslims than christians. Wonder which ones the fox/hannity/etc groups focus on.

It obviously isn't discrimination against christians - they probably did something bad like run from government isis soldiers who told them to stop, failed to obey orders from 'cops' etc.

Sure...maybe some were killed because they were different, but that's just a few bad apples. 

Interesting how things are looked at when you apply a conservative lens to things. Suddenly, cons believe there is discrimination and hate somewhere. Hunh. Weird. 




 That's ok, I don't answer the phone when the IRS calls me. So we are even :) 




 I'll just repost what I said in another thread on this:

Is that some sort of conservative attempt at a 'gotcha' moment? Man, cons are funny people.

Ever hear the old adage "It takes money to make money"? in cases like this, yes, you use resources you have in an attempt to make a change regarding the use of said resources.

You might run a website discussing the over use of coal, and it might be powered by electricity generated by coal. That doesn't make the information you are presenting bad, it is using the system to fight the system.

Investing in the short term to change the long term, etc. But hey, it makes some people get all giddy and say "See, climate change and such isn't real! I is smurt man now, I saw someone use gas in their car and they drove to park on earth day to pick up litter! Hypocrites - it means thar ain't no problems! Wheeee look at me, I'm a super smart science minded conservative!"
 




 Let me try to explain the disconnect.

Man is working hard to support himself and kid. It's not enough. So he gets assistance. The right calls him a bum, welfare queen, etc, and runs around posting stories about how people like him are living up eating lobster and can't possibly be poor because he owns a tv.

Then: The right sits around telling people "If you work hard, you can make it!" all the while ignoring that working hard doesn't mean that at all. It usually means you are getting taken advantage of by people who aren't working hard but running things because they invested in a company and they feel they deserve more of the profits than those doing the actual work.

Those people the right cheers (investors) but when workers ask for me they get called greedy and we are told it will hurt the company and raise prices.

A more progressive view is that, sure, I don't have a problem with investors/etc making more - but I also think kicking down more to the people doing the actual work is the right thing to do.

Here's the thing for me: Despite what the right tells you....not every human can own their own company and be a millionaire. There would be no workers. We need workers to pick up trash, build things, cook, stock shelves, etc. They are just as much a part of this economy as anyone else and while they may not invest money they do invest time (though they do invest money in a way by getting a car, gas for work, right clothes, showers each day, etc and so on). 




 I wonder if that makes the bacon taste better?

 It isn't necessarily that more people favor gay marriage (although they do) - I think, perhaps, more now favor less religion in our government as a reason for having some laws.

The rw argument is our nation will be destroyed, mainly by god, if we allow gays to marry, serve in the military, etc. 

They don't think in a logical manner, they think in a religious way like their cousins in isis/etc. More people nowadays think more for themselves and don't need some invisible sky daddy to play dictator.

Real freedom is something conservatives fight against because it isn't something they can control with bible verses and fear. They want everyone to be obedient to what they are because they are scared if they don't force people to god will do bad things to us all. 




 Investor: "I want more return on my investment"
conservatives: "Smart thinking, we can cut jobs, raise prices some, etc"

Worker: "I want more return on my investment of my labor"
Conservatives: "Greedy bastards! You are what is wrong with this country! You don't deserve more!" 




 You don't need guns just like you don't need science or health care. Just pray. Like when someone you know is sick - don't donate money to find cures, help cover the costs, etc. Pray it away.

Someone is attacking the US? Just pray. You see a crime, drop to your knees and have faith.

See two men kissing? Pray and god will send storms down to punish the country. 

Fundie conservatives. They don't make much sense. 









 If you want to appeal to them just try treating them like fellow humans and citizens who want to live, work, and defend their country and get married - sort of like everyone else is allowed to do.  














 Yep. And if you say it isn't you aren't truly a good christian conservative. The devil is messing with your mind and tricking you - mainly because he has more power now that people with the same genital structure can kiss/marry without being stoned. 




 The republican version is "Rape the earth day". They celebrate by fracking and dropping bombs all over the place and pushing for new laws to kick science books out of school (to be replaced by bibles)

 




 Only when people who don't work for the government do it. 









 It does have the flag on it. Now all it needs are some bible verses on it and a cross. Add some ammo in etched with "John 3:16" and it would be a rw'er dream gun (note, I am all for gun ownership I just find some gun owners to be a little...well...'interesting'). 
























 *But members of Congress are exempted from rules that otherwise prohibit people from having assault weapons, including AR-15s, Capitol Police said.*

Laws for thee but not for me. 














 You must be a conservative because it went over your head. The right will howl about this and the person I replied to was stating that vandalism didn't teach acceptance. Which I agree with.

Now these same cons who will preach that in this case will ignore such core ideals and resort to any and all methods to kill/blow up things/etc in the ME thinking that by doing that they will somehow gain the acceptance and gratitude of the people they are killing. You don't gain acceptance by vandalism or wars/etc, yet it seems the right only gets that idea when it is one them on the receiving end. 









 Sounds like a plan to me, I got nothing better to do :) 




 Well, nothing teaches country in the middle east like we are serious about peace like blowing em all to hell. But for some reason we keep doing it.... 


































 Here is what republicans want:

-Back Israel and push for Armageddon so Jesus will return.

-Ban teaching of evolution and sex ed in schools

-War with Iran (so they can "support the troops" and honor them when they get killed/injured)

-Kick people off food stamps, health care, welfare, unemployment benefits while killing jobs and then calling people lazy (like how they called the unemployed lazy while blaming obama for them not being able to get jobs....)

-Gut science when it comes to climate change and space, funnel money into more guns for peace

-Privatize more schools and prisons so their backers can profit (money is the true god of the right, the golden calf if you will)

-Ban gay marriage, kick gays out of the military - all so that they can save America from hurricane and floods (and earthquakes, like in Oklahoma which are being caused by fracking, but the right denies it because it is science and not in the bible).

And so much more.
 




 That was shitty of her, but she probably doesn't give a crap what I think. But now that they have the body she is in deep doo-doo. 




 If we treated sports like politics the Buckeyes would still be national champions :) 




 For Conservative Media, Iran Is Always A Year Away From Having Nukes 
http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/02/21/for-conservative-media-iran-is-always-a-year-aw/185058

*In December 2005, both Rush Limbaugh and a Washington Times editorial repeated a distortion from the Drudge Report of comments by International Atomic Energy Agency director general Mohamed ElBaradei regarding how soon Iran might have a nuclear weapon; the Times claimed ElBaradei said Iran was "a few months" away and Limbaugh claimed ElBaradei said Iran was "months away."* 




 Netanyahu in 1992: Iran close to having nuclear bomb:

1992: Israeli member of parliament Binyamin Netanyahu predicts that Iran was 3 to 5 years from having a nuclear weapon.

1992: Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres predicts an Iranian nuclear warhead by 1999 to French TV.

1995: The New York Times quotes US and Israeli officials saying that Iran would have the bomb by 2000.

http://www.juancole.com/2012/09/netanyahu-in-1992-iran-close-to-having-nuclear-bomb.html 
























 Well, republicans are big on 'belief' - from their religion and fear god will kill us all because of gays to believing climate change is just a scheme to make money. 

It's all about belief and not facts/science. 





























 Cons tells us if you work hard companies will reward you. Unless you are just an avg worker they can ditch after your hard work and replace with someone younger and cheaper.

Of course, they also believe every single human on the planet can own their own company and be wealthy. Wouldn't be any workers of course...but hey, details don't matter.... 




 Ah, republicans, the party of science.

Earth is 6k years old, climate change is BS, being gay is a choice that causes god to send hurricanes.

The American isis wears a flag and carries a bible. 
























 Most developed countries have single payer, paid sick time and holiday time off, more time off for pregnancy/birth, and spend a lot less on their military.

They also usually have more restrictions on guns.

So...not sure why I care what other countries have when it comes to abortions. 














 Guess we should treat guns like women's rights then the right will do all they can to pass laws restricting them.

Or treat women like guns and they will become holier than the cross to the right. 




 Often times people, like the disabled, send someone to the store for them. Or someone may have transportation issues, etc. 




 Just wait, breitbart/levin/etc will be out later saying that Obama is sending our ships there to give them to Iran as a gesture of peace and working together to make the US into a caliphate.

And the right wing will believe it. 




 Another weird thing is that Jews don't believe Jesus was the son of god, basically they are 'atheists' when it comes to Christianity. 

*Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?*

Overall, Jews reject the ideas of Christians but fundies have bound themselves to those who reject their beliefs. They see Israel as their path to both salvation from punishment and to the end times. Their belief is that if they are nice to a nation that rejects the very core of their beliefs they will get some sort of favor in return (and they seem to forget all the times god punished israel/judah for rejecting him....).

Their allegiance doesn't really make a lot of sense. I can see them as an ally in the region from a strategic point of view. But to put them above reproach and accuse anyone who speaks out against their policies as anti-semitic/hater/anti-christian is just...well, nuts. 




 Not the media so much as the actual people themselves, especially (but not only) online.

I follow every tv station in the US on twitter and see plenty of news. Yeah, there are some loons on the left too - another reason I am proudly, and have been since '84 a registered independent.

Now the news I read (out side a few places) generally isn't overly slanted (because I see so much of it). But I do read comments and rw sites/comments. I also listen to a lot of radio and shows on talkshoe (where anyone can broadcast live for free, have a chatroom and phone number for call in).

And the more I have seen/heard the more I am convinced that the rw cons in this country are just plain nuts. Not rational people trying to have a rational discussion. 

As far as hurricanes/gays - just google around. And what you will find are the people saying that are conservatives and republicans. And to make it more interesting try to find someone with that alignment saying it's crazy. They just shrug and ignore it as though they expect it or partially believe it (Christians are a huge chunk of the populace here and the more fundie ones are republicans - and they do believe god punishes the US for it's 'sins)

The left has it's wackos as well, but with a big tent they tend to fight with each other and it balances out in a broad sense. On the right folks tend to march in lockstep on a broad scale. They have a common hate (obama/liberals) and a common core (bible/religion).

The two groups are different. 




 Nice use of 'strawman' - people seem to pull out that word a lot....

Conservatives here in the US are, by and large, loony religious zealots. Against gays in military, gay marriage, etc because they fear god will send hurricanes/judge America. 

They insist Obama is a muslim - again, bringing religion into politics. They create policies based on bible verses they take out of context "If a man does not work he does not eat" kind of crap.

Their whole philosophy they back up with god. And yes, they are wanting to punish America. Look at what was being said when Obama was elected; they wouldn't cooperate with him, rush/et al said they hope he (thus we) fail. 

Try listening to rw radio for a week or reading what the loonies are claiming (obama and ebola and how we were all gonna die cause he hates america, the whole stolen libyan jet BS which turned out to be false, Obama will take all the guns with no discussion of how he was going to, etc and so on). 




 I ain't no big fan of Obama either and not a huge fan of the aca (better than nothing to get the ball rolling). Some of his policies and decisions I can certainly complain about. But, yeah, these people are just plain nuts. If he looks the wrong way while at the podium they run off screaming he is a commie mooslim who took all the border patrol away and threw open the border for ebola laden kids trained by isis.

I don't take the right serious anymore and will never, ever, in my whole life vote for a republican (which I did up until 2004, including raising some funds for ole bush). 

It's like some virus from space landed on earth and took over their minds and erased critical thinking skills, courage, honesty, etc. It makes me regret saying I ever voted for them in the past. Was i that dumb or was the party a little different last century? 




 Can you imagine if Hillary wins it all? My god, their heads will explode. Bet you they make a run on gun stores again swearing by all they deem holy that like Obama she WILL take all the guns. Not that she wants to, no logic on how she could if she wanted to, but that she will. And the suckers will believe it like they did with Obama.

Of course someone will come along and say "But Obama was in favor of the awb" yeah...that's a long way from he "will" take all your guns - which is what some still claim.

Not rational humans and the type who make america look dumb as hell. 




 Which means cons will try to get him replaced with someone more nutty. Tea party folks especially can't handle reason and logic. It's all about how they 'feel' about someone. 




 Of course the comments are insane - do you know any conservatives that are rational? 

It's all about emotions. They are pissed off because they lost twice and want to punish obama/usa for losing. There is not one conservative that care about this country over their little parties (tea/gop). Think about it: They are mostly fundies who love Israel over the US and are praying daily for Jesus to come back and kill off most the human race. The want this. They live for it.

We're not dealing with sane or rational people. Not one, not one anywhere, will stand up and call BS on things like this, Iraq, etc because they have no courage and no principles. They just have getting on their knees for their party and to pray for god to punish/kill all the sinners.

Loony people. 




 Does anyone with a bit of intelligence actually read dailycaller each day? Good god, it's like WND but worse.

Of course, the people dumb enough to want congress to hold hearings about nasa and temperature readings probably would read it .

Conservatives make me embarrassed to call myself an American. If I ever travel abroad it will be with my head held in shame should anyone recognize I come from the usa. 




 What is most likely is the right is trolling because, as usual, they can't stand on the issues so they will just attack with made up shit. 




 The right is always wanting to destroy things. I guess it speaks to their ignorance and lack of desire to learn and understand things.

We took out Iraq and Afghanistan and that fixed what? Leaders of Al Qaeda and we still aren't 'safe' from terrorists and people carrying bottled water onto planes.

America has become the land of perpetual fear where there is always a 'devil' we need some party to 'save' us from. Republicans have a 'jesus' complex. 




 Don't even have to click on it to know it is rw'ers whining and crying because they can't win on issues :) 




 And Obama being born in Kenya may sink his presidential chances. Riiiight.

I love the right, they are so much fun and so easy. It's like they live in a bias bubble and can't see outside of it. Again. 




 It's Luke behind the mask. Or Jar-Jar. 




 From what I can tell by the schools, but their websites aren't clear on that :/ 




 you can tell the republicans are scared by how loony they get.

Look at everything they claimed about Obama (and still do).  




 Paul lets conservatives here distance themselves from bush and the iraq war (and tsa/patriot act/etc) while still supporting what they see as conservative ideals.

In reality, they probably don't agree with him on a lot of things. When it comes to Israel, for example, they are still married to the bible above the country whereas (at one point) Paul looked at it from a more practical point of view.

Conservatives are, at their core, religious people. They react based on what they believe god wants or doesn't want. On the country side they don't care about gay marriage - but they believe god will punish a country that allows it. So paul is sort of a go between where they can pretend it isn't about religion while hedging their bets: "I am still a conservative but not really" is pretty much how it goes with them.

Paul gives them street cred early on which they will toss out the window in a heartbeat as soon as they can. They can pretend to have principles and 'look good' right now because they know he won't win. Then later they will push for someone who is truly backwards and regressive. 




 While people in both parties can act that way let's look at some basics.

During the bush admin, yes there were negatives tossed out. But much of it was correct. The economy tanked, wars were a bust, and we lost more freedoms and government got more power.

Obama gets elected and predictions from the GOP are a bust. Obama didn't take all of the guns, he didn't let ebola kill us all, the economy didn't tank and market crash, he wasn't born in Kenya, he didn't force all the conservatives into Fema camps and turn the US into a caliphate.

There is 'negative' and then there is bat shit crazy. The cons in this country are nuts. 




 Thanks for the insight.

It would be nice, imho, if the media covered more of what reps/etc do locally for people (Joyce Beatty is my rep here in Ohio) or if the reps would put more info out showing how they have helped people locally (again, all of this aside from voting).

I was complaining in an earlier thread (in news) about the lack of local talk shows on radio (consolidation, local shows replaced by big radio names, etc). Way back in my day we had more local radio where politicians actually talked about constituent services and the like.

It seems candidates disappear off the radar (to the media) when elected and the general public doesn't see the day to day work they do and feel more and more isolated from their congressperson. 

Just my 2 cents :) 




 Like I said, I tend to be a tad cynical :)

Seems like there is a lot of 'horsetrading' that goes on in the background, lobbying, politics and the people elected are less interested in what your average person thinks about an issue than they are in bigger/more powerful/influential 'groups'.

I have had success with issues I needed assistance with in the pass by calling my congressperson. Nice people, good information, even made a call on my behalf to help get things resolved. 

But when it comes to voting I just don't see A) that they would listen to me and B) that the congress person ever even knows I called/etc and what it is I said. But - obviously, they can't spend all day listening to people. Not practical.

Can you explain what happens to the letters/calls/etc - are they collated, numbers given, some comments passed on? 




 She could just say she is in the militia and the cat was caught sneaking over the border. 

As far as Texas:

 3)       Shooting stray Dogs and Cats (Penal Code 42.09 Animal Cruelty).  Any person who shoots a non-livestock animal, which includes any stray or feral cat or dog, and a wild living creature previously captured, can be charged with a felony offense.  Penal Code 42.092 of the State of Texas law states that a person must have the owners consent to kill the animal (exceptions to prosecution are provided in Section 42.092(e)(1)).  It is clear that a stray dog or cat either has no owner or that the person who shoots the animal did not get the owners consent. 




 How much do they even care on average? Calls, faxes, emails, which do they even pay attention to?

Seems like lobbyists $peak the loudest to them. But, maybe at my age I am just a tad cynical :) 




 I think they are just trying to make sure a crime really happened first. Was it feral, domestic, was it even a real cat/photo? Was the cat already dead and she just abused the body as a joke? Etc and so on. 

Employers can fire you for anything, the government needs a little more to go on (usually. One would hope anyway) before charging someone.  




 The whole thing boils down to one simple idea:

You don't have to customize things in a way you don't want. Whether it is a credit card company and the pic you want for a background or a bakery not wanting to write something on a cake.

You still have to bake the cake, etc, but customization has always been protected. From cuss words to everything else. 

I don't understand why all of that gets lost in these discussions. 




 Probably because a lot of more progressive people don't need to be babied and lied to in order to support their ideals. Like religious people in the ME or here - they don't want anything that contradicts their beliefs, they want someone to lie to them and validate their hate/fears. 

A smart business person will give them that and get their money in return because they know not one of them would dare challenge someone on what they say. Might put a crack in their armor and belief systems.

Interestingly enough note how rw christians here brag that they are not like muslims and have become more 'progressive' over the centuries. Then they attack the people muslims listen to and tell them there is a better way, etc. 

If only they would take their own advice, not listen but think, and continue trying to be more progressive than they used to be. Again, it is funny how they tout how much more progressive their faith has become - slavery is bad now, blacks can marry whites, women can vote, etc - all progressive ideals compared to the backwards way of how they used to use the bible.

The right needs someone to listen to because deep down they know they are wrong and don't like to face that. 




 That the 20 soldiers/vets who kill themselves a day aren't going to hell.

Fundie conservatives believe that they are (and you can look that up) and religion/hell are popular with them - and their opinion that death by suicide leads to hell is quite popular amongst them

They call the poor, homeless, sick, etc lazy, stupid, weak - even the veterans they claim to care about. But I guess their idea of care is to send them to wars or something.

So, yeah, I guess my view of them will be unpopular to them but it is at least accurate.

Just because a depressed vet (or anyone else) takes their life doesn't mean they will burn in hell forever. I don't care how popular that idea is amongst them, it's stupid. 




 I have an open hostility towards some in that faith. They want to make their own little 'caliphate' here, I call em the American ISIS. Rule by religion. Kick science out of schools. Encourage discrimination of others out of fear god will punish the whole country (two men kissed? Hurricane!). Control the medical decisions of women and relegate people to praying for healing instead of getting actual health care.

They are sick people who serve mostly money and their own interpretation of some old book - which they will put above their own country.

Dangerous bigots who should be on a watch list. 




 see my earlier reply. And yeah, a multiparty system would be great. Just like having radio/tv/papers again that weren't owned and controlled by the few. From politics to info the few want to control the many - hence why some were so against net neutrality. 




 Why does a show have to have a hard political bent? I registered as an independent in 1984, and I have listened to a lot of local shows over the years where the host was pretty open to all sides of things and facilitated discussion instead of trying to overtly control it.

The was licenses are structured now and with consolidation we have lost a lot of local hosts and instead have shows like here on one local station hours of beck, then rush, then hannity, then levin - about 11 hours of rw talk radio on a national level and most of it just fear mongering and distortions.

Oh hey, here is an idea, I could get my own station and start a show, right? No. Big companies have bought up the spectrum here to control and stop competition (same in most markets). 

Yes, I have worked in radio (and still do, albeit internet only at the time - though we can broadcast a pirate signal). 

Radio has become like politics - run by the few for the few and small, local community radio has been taken away for the most part.

 When I go fishing down at the creek I like to putt around in a small 'john boat' (as we call em). I prefer using a Minn Kota trolling motor.

What kind of trolling motor are you using? 




 Rush blames the Obama's for just about everything. The guy lies and is wrong on so many things I don't know how he stays on the air...except conservatives see him as a preacher and just go on 'faith'. 




 Some american soldiers murdered people in iraq. They weren't enemies, just civilians.

Believe it or not some people in our military are like that.

There are people who guns who shoot/rob others. Seen them in real life myself, but not in a bagel shop, at a pizza shop.

So...ok. What's your point anyway? 




 Veteran was wrong in this case. 

The old "I am willing to die for your freedoms" stuff wears old when you have someone who is willing to basically steal from protestors over a piece of cloth. Bush walked all over the damned flag with his wars, tsa, patriot act, etc and got cheered on. After 9/11 the right insisted we stand behind him no matter what...benghazi happens and suddenly these same people want to impeach.

The very people who will whine about people walking on the flag are the ones who stood by before saluting the screwing over of our troops. Patriotism isn't a flag you wave or a bible you thump.
 




 The media seems to cover such things a lot, which is fine. But there are laws that expire, need renewed, ones that update rules, etc and so on. 

There are a lot of laws that need fixed - from patriot act, tsa, etc to this like this: H.R.41: To temporarily increase the borrowing authority of the Federal Emergency Management Agency for carrying out the National Flood Insurance Program.

Laws don't all have to be new and restrictive and there are enough problems in the legal codes we have to keep congress busy - if they are willing to fix them. 




 Some laws remove restrictions, some fix problems (VA/etc). Not all laws are made to restrict freedoms but help the government we pay for to run better and change as needed. 




 I was on it for a short time in the 90's. Was on worker's comp, they lost paperwork, so lost benefits for a time. It was no fun. Food stamps, putting off one bill for one month then another the next.

3 kids, disabled wife (now deceased) who didn't get benefits. Some months we did manage to save a little and got the kids happy meals. It was a huge treat to them but others looked down on us for being 'frivolous'. Long story short, after about 14 months and a hearing before 3 judges I got everything fixed and settlement and went back to work (though I still suffer from the injury, I turned down permanent partial disability so I could work and get out of the system. Still some jobs I can't do.) 




 Which is a dumb idea. You use less electric that month, coupons, etc... 




 Thanks for the new information! 




 So if you save a little each month....oh, wait, if you save a penny you aren't poor enough for conservatives. It means a penny more that the government can use to kill people in other countries.

Message to poor people - don't save a damn dime because if you do it means you aren't poor. You can't save up for anything. So quit suffering each month to try for something you want - it's not christian or american like, you know? 




 It ain't 'murican to not pray afore eating yer hot dogs and stop everything to grab yer bible and stand still fer da pledge. Git r done! 




 Ohioan here as well and I would agree. I am sick of driving around the countryside and seeing damn corn and soybeans. Pot would be awesome to see. Keep the pumpkin patches though :) 




 "We're going to have to have a meeting about all these damned meetings!" 




 If you read his FB page he is now claiming he is getting death threats for his beliefs and something about a gofundme page. LOL. OK buddy. He is just taking advantage of bigots who will shower him with money.

America. Fuck yeah. 




 If you notice on his FB page his last post was December. Then on the 14th he posted this crap. Then later on started a post basically saying it wasn't fair he was getting death threats, etc. And set up a gofundme. Sounds like a copycat. 




 Care to expand on that? I don't dislike religion, it's the followers of it I have problems with (and not all of them). 

I am guessing you have never had any issues at all with people using religion to control others via laws/etc? 




 My concerns are those with power in this country who use their religion to make decisions about laws. 

It seems, from your comments, that you don't like religious people all that much either. On that we seem to agree. 




 Don't know about there, but hope it goes away from here in the US sooner than later.

Fundies are against helping people, non-inclusive, believe people who kill themselves go right to hell (including the 20+ veterans a day that kill themselves). They want America to makes it's laws based on some old book and believe god sends hurricanes/floods/etc to harm america because two men kiss each other (all the while ignoring rape, robbery, murder, suffering of the poor, starving kids, etc...yeah...all god cares about when it comes to sin and the US is gay people.)

 Yeah, but he was afraid they would end up on hillary's private email server and he would somehow be tied to Benghazi....Everything ties to Benghazi!!11!1!! 




 Another defeat for fundie bigots. But hey, they can still get pizza in Indiana at their favorite place. 




 Let me guess, they are conservative and Christian. 

*checks article*

Yes, yes she is. You can spot em a mile away on issues from race to gender to sexuality. They are like the US version of isis. 




 I dunno, must have won though because he changed topic and said he would just downvote everything I posted. Usually, people do/say things like that when they can't continue the argument and are faced with facts. 

I think he was mad because he said someone else posted the same thing I did and I got a lot of upvotes on it. When I pointed out some things, and even talked to the other person who posted it and they told me it was obvious I posted it first, he got even more upset.

I don't get some of the drama....Been online since BBS days and, at times, reddit seems worse than the old alt.flame wars :) 




 I just try to do something I enjoy each day even though I am in a bad situation. I keep it simple - example from my own life:

I used to make a decent living, would drive across country a few times a year. Out of work, car died and junked, have just about nothing materially - but have a place to stay, food, and the internet. Lots to read, learn, etc. It sucks compared to how it once was - but I have a daughter and we play games and have fun each day.

I listen to the radio, watch movies, and am happy each day my daughter isn't ill and in the hospital. I get no govt aid, don't ever have hope of getting a car again and working (hard to do without a car/etc) - but each and every day I see her smile and we laugh.

 




 You can buy a 10 year supply, for one person, of food (freeze dried) for 12k. I would buy a few of those and lock in the rest on a car and a bomb shelter - just in case a republican wins in 2016 ;) 




 Pretty much no one PM's me. But one guy did, after losing an argument, and said he would follow me and downvote anything I said/posted. 

I think he was serious because I post a lot of things in news/politics and even stories that get way voted up get to zero right after I post them it seems...But, meh, not like karma gets you anything. 

I still find it funny :) I just post for fun and to discuss interesting things with my fellow humans. If I get more Karma than someone do I win something? What am I missing? 




 I was at the theater the night it came out. Midnight showing. Only show my dad and I ever went to together (movies just weren't his thing). IIRC I had school the next day but he knew how much I wanted to see it and took me.

Yeah, it was somewhat of a shock. But one of the things that stuck with me was Han and Leia. We didn't know Luke and her were sister/brother (I think I was 14 at the time, no internet, etc). Why was Leia warming up to Han when it seemed like she and Luke would be together?

Heck, I was ok with the whole Luke/Vader thing, thought Yoda was awesome, but why couldn't Luke get the damned girl? Han had Chewbacca, R2 had 3PO, and luke had...well, not leia it seems.

Of course, being a young man my thoughts were with Leia :) And I used to play with my action figures and it always worked out that Luke and Leia were together. Until Jedi... 




 Over 90% of the terror list is created by Christians in the US.

Weird. 

China, the US, Russia aren't really on that list - but they are the ones supplying arms, starting wars, overthrowing governments, supporting regimes.

When you define who is a 'terror' org what does that really mean anyway? 




 So let me see if I understand this. Hillary has some times to some for profit colleges. Then, instead of giving them (colleges) a pass - she calls them out. Ok. 

What am I missing here? Should she have showered them with glowing praise because someone says she has ties to them? Or is that something conservatives expect because when they are bought and paid for they give such things a pass?

 





























 I am wondering how he even learned of that.  









 I'm getting a bag of peanuts for it - nothing like peanuts for the circus, makes the dog and pony show all that more authentic. 


































 Ahhh, conservatives. Less than 1% of those on welfare are abusing the system - so they want to dismantle it.

Gun owners.Less than 1% use them to shoot others. Suddenly the right is all like "You can't judge all by the few! Most are good, law abiding patriotic Americans." 









 When I don't want to pay my bills I put them in a bag and leave them in the park as well. Hasn't worked yet, I still owe em all. 









 "People complain about 'muslim' on non-muslim crime and it gets all over the news, but what about american on american crime? How come that doesn't get talked about? Wonder how soon x/y/z will show up pimping how non-muslims are being discriminated against by muslims?" 

Funny how all that sounds when you take what the right says about crimes involving blacks and apply it elsewhere..... 
























 We might spend more on porn that politics, but the antacids we buy are because of politics. 












































 Do whites treat other whites poorly at times? Do they discriminate against other whites (like Irish, etc)?

Weird how this works. Some just assume all blacks see all other blacks as the same but when it comes to whites they don't expect that. 

Does it help to be better represented when it comes to race, class, etc and so on? I would say it does. Does that automatically solve all the problems in the system? I would say it doesn't.

So you can have a legit gripe about being represented on X but that doesn't always lead to Y and Z. 

The right only hears one thing when it comes to this issue. 




 That's cute. The idea is that government employees are abusing power (like the right complains about with Obama, but didn't with bush...weird. Anyway,) and have been doing so and getting away with it.

The justice system favors some over others. A point the people were protesting about. I don't think people were complaining that those who were abusing power were all white, but were all in a position of power.

Now...are blacks sentenced, arrested, charged, pulled over, etc in a disproportionate amount? If so - isn't that something worth looking at? Does it matter who does it? 

Weren't white people (jews/pols/gays/etc) killed by other whites in ww2? Are you saying that if they complained they were being targeted that they had no case because they were all white?

Classicism, etc, are all real problems. But leave it to someone to ignorantly yell "There are some black cops, so all is ok! Git r done buddies!" 




 We need Issa and Gowdy on this, stat. 15 investigations and millions of dollars and we should know right around election time. 














 When people are used to being abused by cops - either unwarranted stops, searches, etc - they might just have a case for avoiding them quickly. 

Waco and Ruby Ridge - why didn't people just obey the cops? Bundy Ranch - why didn't they guy just pay the fine, why did so many show up with guns?

The right seems to have no problem in justifying their distrust of government but when others do it they suddenly get all weird. You watch the protests? When cops were approaching many people ran - why didn't the cops just beat em and shoot em? Maybe because they knew it was wrong...when the cameras were rolling. 




 So that's how he works. "Well, this sounds like something I can use to bash someone, so I will just read it on air."

Wonder if he will follow up on it?

"Why, I am never wrong, I just read things as though it were factual from people who are wrong." And the right laps it up "We don't need to fact check anything, we believe it! Just like we believe Obama ordered a stand down at Benghazi!" 




 Maybe because he claims he is never wrong, and conservatives believe him. But then...they think fox is a legit new source. 









 *He was a victim of a system that is just waiting for an excuse to attack, and he gave the system that reason. If you poke a bear you should not be surprised if you are bitten*

And if you're caught speeding don't be surprised if a government employee beats you. I mean, after all, you gave them a reason to interact with you. Heck, the person pulled over has probably sped many times so they obviously have total disregard for the law.

By the way, what crime was he guilty of that they chased him down? 









 The blame I see has more than one facet.

The war on (some) drugs. Targeting areas, using tickets/etc as a revenue source, and so on. 

As I said before, I can blame individuals and the system. I can't fix individuals, but we can work and fix the system and the people we pay to manage that system.

Not in favor of the riot side, but large protests and stuff do seem to get the message out. Think about the 60's and civil rights and vietnam. 

That does not mean I can't try to understand why people do what they do (even if I don't agree with their actions). Simply dismissing things as people being hoods/thugs/etc is easy but ignores underlying causes.

It is like how the right says "Muslims over there in the middle east are bad, do bad things, and hate us fer our freedoms! Git R Done!" and don't stop to think for a minute about the causes behind some of the things - like us overthrowing their leaders, etc.

Simple minded people see simple minded solutions. They usually watch fox and listen to rush who play to that. 














 He's doing better than that Pizza place in Indiana :) 




 So many things work well in theory that don't in reality.

Let's look at ole bush. Torture happens, he skates. Cheney shoots some guy in the face, meh. 

Big companies screw the country and get bailouts. Companies contribute to deaths, basically steal from people, etc and pay a small fine.

All things people have exposed and the justice system ignores. What was is the conservatives have been saying since 2008? Something about the tree of liberty, etc....

You think the people in Ferguson hadn't been trying to make changes for years? It took the protests to get real reports on the corruption and change to start.

The people in power (and those with money) have to have the will to change things. They get lazy and comfortable until some things wake them up.

Ferguson and Baltimore both got people talking about issues they generally ignore - which is weird because we have so many 24x7 news stations. Politicians can get elected and try to do something, but then party politics take over and legislation and funding go nowhere. 














 That made no sense.

*So why was this kid, and so many others, happy to give the corrupt police a reason to screw them?*

Your saying that corrupt cops needs chances/reason to act corrupt and then blame the victim for not avoiding them? So...if you go 5 mph over the speed limit and a cop stops you and beats the crap out of you then you are at fault? Hunh. Weird.

Sounds like conservative style thinking about an issue. "Why, if them folks in Iraq had kicked out Saddam like we wanted, we wouldn't have had to bomb em up real good!" 




 *"Not one of the officers involved in this tragic situation left home in the morning with the anticipation that someone with whom they interacted would not go home that night,"*

Yeah, I am sure just about every criminal can claim the same. Funny how these people don't care about police abuse of power, people getting charged with 'resisting', ticketed for filming cops or being harassed by them, etc.

Now, suddenly, they want people to stop and think about things.

Suck when you get treated how you treat others, don't it. 




 Conservatives see the people as the problem. Liberals see both the people and the system as having flaws. 

You can't fix a problem you don't believe exists. 




 I am not interested in individuals and their personal problems - from what crimes they have done to anything else.

People in government with power that abuse it, though, is something we should care about and can do something about. We pay them, they work for us. 

Cops are to protect/serve. When cops fail at that we should come down on them for failing to do their job. I would think conservatives would be all for that.

When you have a system that is a mess we should be outraged. The justice system screws over people daily. That is part of why the US has more people in prison than other countries. People on the right tend not to pay attention to this (in fact, they see a way to make money from it with private prisons/etc).

Their usual solutions are things like "get a job", "more prayer in schools" and so on. All because those things require no thinking. The deep issues that exist get glossed over and ignored in favor of what people see in a rather twisted light "I haven't been arrested, beaten, screwed over by the system - so you can avoid it to if you act like me!"

And what that is your solution - you haven't seen the real problem at all. 




 And countries like Norway and Sweden have a lot more social safety nets....so what are you saying?

Disparities in justice system by people abusing their power has nothing to do with the citizens and what benefits they get. 
 
























 You keep saying "dem/republican".

There are plenty of people in both parties who lean conservative or liberal on some issues. I am talking about core values - not party.

*I think the real problem is lack of police training/internal controls and the culture that lets them think they could get away with arresting someone without cause and then intentionally not putting a seatbelt on the guy.*

As a former LEO I can tell you that is, indeed, a problem. That problem gets exacerbated by the the entire justice system - but yes, it starts with the cops IMHO (not always).

When people in a certain area are targeted for enforcement than in other areas you get a lot more 'crime' suddenly. Jay walking, riding a bike with no helmet, 'speeding/distracted driving/rolling stops' etc and so on.

Those people now have to take time from work for court, pay more fines, etc than people in other areas. All the while other people do the same and get ignored - and then those people point to those other areas/people start to get biased and demand more police to bust more people. 




 No, Mr. Bush, the processed worked this one time out of many. If you spoke about these issues more (social injustice, abuse of power in the justice system) I might take you more seriously. 














 As expected people totally miss it. 

Cons are rushing to push the whole meme "It's a dem city, so we don't expect there would be social issues" which is kind of funny when you think about it....

The two groups look at the issue in a different way. I don't care the politics of the city. People in power in either party can, and do abuse power. So this isn't about party politics but about perception of real issues.

Conservatives blow off those who have regular problems and side with those in government and stand up for them (unless, of course, it's that one guy in Office, Obama). They blame the victims of government power abuse and incompetence.

Liberals tend to see the issue as something that is fundamentally wrong with the system and how it works, while also saying if someone did something wrong they should be held accountable. But many aren't because they aren't poor, minority, etc. 

I would think the right would care about unequal justice and abuse of the system against the citizens. But they keep proving me wrong by siding against the people they don't like and patting those doing the abuse on the back.

Pretend like it was obama making the arrest and someone dying. Issa/Gowdy would do 15 investigations, fox would carry it 24x7 and demand justice. 









 Not even really talking about Ferguson. I am talking about issues every day across the US when it comes to cops and the justice system. Ferguson was about that build up, so was Baltimore. There were breaking points. The right is quick, especially now, to dismiss and use Ferguson to say "See, there wasn't any issue at all!" when the point protestors were making is crap happens every damned day.

Sure, some of it is small (being harassed, pulled over a lot, etc by cops). But some is larger. Extra charges tacked on, unequal protection and so on.

Conservatives tend to only care about a few big incidents ignoring the elephant in the room. 









 And so it begins. From fox to hannity to rw sites across the web.....

People who generally ignore the plight of people who have complained for decades about problems with the justice will suddenly pay attention and find fault it in .

When it's blacks, indians, hispanics, poor people getting screwed over every single day they just shrug and tell em "If you wouldn't have got arrested you wouldn't be in this situation, obey the law, get a job, etc"

Sure as hell though when one of said group are unarmed and die by cop they are out there setting up gofundme's for the cop(s), raging out injustice etc.

We get it conservatives, we really do :) 




 I can hear conservatives across the country saying that now.

All the while they have ignored this as a real problem in some communities for years and told people to quit whining about it.

Suddenly though, they seem critical of a system.

Funny how that works. 














 It goes like this. There were several investigations done that found nothing. Then there is another investigation that drags on and you want it to drag on more, so you order those other documents to slow things down.

Imagine if 9/11/2001 were investigated like this, it would still be going on. Some things would be classified, then there would be court battles over a few of them, they get released, then more and and when it's all done there is another investigation just for the hell of it and you slowly ask for all that same documentation as before *and* new docs to explore what people said about those other docs later...

It's like the never ending story. Well...until the election. Then suddenly it will wrap up with what we learned the first time. 










































































 I dunno, but mine's been 'frozen' for 6 years. Will see if someone from /r/gonewild will taste it and see if it's still good. Only way to be sure. 




 Told them to be scared of Iraq, now Iran, and fed into their fears. Conservatives are emotional creatures who are afraid of everything and anyone not straight, white, and Christian. Republicans stoke those fears and promise to play daddy for them and keep them safe.

It makes them feel better and not alone in their psychosis. It's not just them as individuals believing the poor people are destroying America by asking for help with food and medical care, they have people in office that whisper to them. Now they aren't alone in the things they imagine. 




 Might have been if this was Springfield Elementary.

http://imgur.com/r3xJlo5 
























 And if 1+1 doesn't equal 3 they will find a way to blame Obama/Benghazi for why. 




 Now, now. Don't confuse a conservative with facts. You know they all live off of emotions and beliefs (Hey, the bible said the earth is only 6,000 years old - that is real science!).

I bet the person who posted this will be here any minute now to assure us this is a true and honest depiction of things (because Jesus told them how we must all work to eat and such....) 




 Wait...what? I read the article. Did you?

*In August, his boss is shutting down Z Pizza and putting him and his 11 co-workers out of work.*

And then.... *So she has to give raises within the next two years.*

So what it seems like to me is that the owner is using this as an excuse. Funny how the right ditches analysis and such in cases like this.

But, hey, conservatives go for emotion because they are always lacking on facts (how did that whole 'Obama ordered a stand down with Benghazi' work out for you?? Ohhh...right.) 















































































 Riiiight. Oh wait, it's from a conservative, no wonder it is so dumb.

Riot-plagued? LOL. And hey, maybe if cons weren't the ones raising funds for cops who kill unarmed black people they might see where the real problem is.

Carry on conservatives, I needed a laugh and a reason to feel superior to some fundie idiots today :) 


































 How do you kill someone over the phone, is there an app for that? 


































 Maybe not, but some think it is worth a shot. 







































 Why, I thought it was lack of prayer in school. Or does that just cause riots after buckeye games?

I think it is more a breakdown of our social justice system than anything. 



















 If you need help grasping for those straws let us know and someone might get you a hand. 









 HAHAHAHA OMG the conservatives fell for this???

Go to hillary's twitter account. I'll wait. Ok, you go there? Tell us, do you see the thing that tweets by Hillary are signed "-H"?

Was that in the tweet they are whining about? No? Hunh....guess they blew a dog whistle and people came running without thinking.

A sure sign of a conservative. 




 He must be correct because conservatives have been promoting what some Iranians have said about nuke negotiations. Obviously they are just telling the truth. 




 Cons think violence against brown people is normal - whether from cops, prisons, or bombing them in other countries. They applaud the solution - until those same people engage in violence. Then...suddenly...violence is wrong and should be covered, talked about, etc.

They are licking their chops on this right now. They promote every negative story on iran, muslims, blacks, and raise funds for cops that shoot people and spending on wars/weapons. Funny how it all works in their minds. 




 Peaceful things aren't news to most people, it's what we expect. 

But it is worth noting how some say "Violence doesn't accomplish anything." - unless of course it is the military, and then magically violence is the answer to all the problems in the world.

Funny how that works with some people. 









 I get what it is here in politics. I just wish I could get why crap spewed by Mike Huckabee isn't. I mean, we post political things all the time from writers who aren't even politicians and never have been but Huckabee gets the 'off topic' label. Weird. 




 Cops kill/shoot/beat blacks and the justice system screws them and the rw shrugs. Black commits a crime and suddenly they care about the race side.

We get it :) 

















































 Here's one story
http://www.king5.com/story/news/local/2015/04/27/north-thurston-high-school-shooter/26449025/ 




 Source  TV news station in WA (I cropped the image because original shows the phone number, hopefully they will fix that on their website) 
























 My dick. 




 I thought it was god? Well, I guess to some they are the same thing. 




 My personal take on it:

Obi Wan was there to look after Luke on Tatooine and set him on his path/protect him. By dying here he was able to better aid Luke now in the long term and continue his mission. 

Both he and Luke now progressed and Vader was under the impression that the last of the Jedi's was gone, which upped his arrogance that it was just he, the emperor, and the empire. Yoda was surely too old and probably dead, Obi Wan gone, there was no one left to teach, so his guard on that front would be down.

Again, just my guess :) 














 Weird, posted the same thing the other day and it was labeled 'off topic'. I kind of think it is on topic.... 




 We have had a bush in the whitehouse for 20 years out of the past 35. I am sure we can find someone else in this large country of ours that can handle the job. 



















 Cool. Thanks for the answer. One more Q? If you were to recommend a service to someone outside your coverage area what would you recommend and barring that what would you personally suggest what sort of things would you tell people to look for/against?

Not in the market myself but eventually might be when I move in a few years. I am just not overly trusting of alarm companies (no rational reason off the top of my head, just one of them things). 




 Have you installed any system into your house? 














 Any article that uses 'gaystapo' is written by an uneducated conservative (yeah, I know, redundant).  




 Fox news. Probably not planes at all. I was shocked though that they didn't mention benghazi in the article. They must be slipping.  




 GOP: "Stop gays, food stamps, unemployment, make people have ID's for voting and welfare, track their spending and limit it!"

"Can we get a rundown of the security expenses of that guy we elected?"

GOP: "Hell no!" 

















































 I think this is assuming people are 'making' things. It is hard to measure productivity this way, especially when the idea is that every minutes equals 'money'.

But am guessing there will be companies that will run with this. 

















































 Let me guess. You're a conservative. Now, now, don't clap, it wasn't hard to figure out. Take something that someone didn't say, pretend they did, and presto - you have something you can try to use to bolster an argument you know you will lose if you don't (welfare/dependency). 

Now, one could note the year of the article, 2011. Which means you are probably just trolling for comments (another sign of a conservative who can't win arguments).

But hey, carry on, fun to see cons squirming and twisting. Makes me all happy :) 




 In the US it is practiced by drunk people. 









 "Amid mounting political pressure, the ATF last month put the bullet ban on the back burner, but left the door open for future rule-making."

Um, was there a way to 'close the door'? If not then they didn't leave the door open they just didn't decide at this time to do it.

Against the ban myself. Since most crimes involving the shooting of cops aren't planned and arise out of circumstance I don't think there is much basis to ban these because of cops. If someone is planning on killing a cop, any old bullet would do if you plan it out. 




 So what? According to conservatives all you have to do is work harder. Sure, you might work 2 or 3 jobs, but if you aren't getting all you want in life from work that is your fault.

And now someone is trying to blame, what, blame immigrants? LOL. Ok.

Remember when republicans voted against an extension for unemployment benefits? They said aid to those unemployed made them lazy and if they cut aid those lazy people would get jobs?

According to them there are tons of jobs out there. And the only reason your income is dropping is you are lazy and you aren't training yourself for new jobs.

And now they are trying to blame immigrants?? Yeah...get your message straight. 







































 I see you've constructed a new lightsaber.  





























 Let me guess - prayer. Which is what they suggest for everything. Except defense, then it's all "Hey, we should all chip in to stop them thar terrorists. But the things actually killing people? Nah, just pray and work hard! Git r done!" 




 OH.....so NOW people are worried about money in politics?

Super pacs are great, lobbyists buying off congress is cool, but damn - when it comes to a debate we need to be careful! 

















































 My Advice: I didn't like it either. Didn't get through first season.

Then I listened to others. It gets a lot better and well worth watching. Folks here were right, tell your sister they were right... 














 The new legislation is expected to include:

*     introducing Banning Orders for extremist organisations who

but fall short of proscription

*     new Extremism Disruption Orders to restrict people 
who seek to radicalise young people

*     powers to close premises where extremists

*     strengthening the powers of the Charity Commission 
 to root out charities who misappropriate

 She will quit before she even starts. 




 Conservatives will be upset that facts will be taught and not mythology. 

What's next, an abstain from driving class because if you don't drive you won't ever have an accident and our founders and Jesus didn't have cars.  










































































 God helped us elect Obama over any of the conservative fundies that were running. He also helped gay marriage to get passed in many states.

God sure is busy. 




 Why? Maybe because you have access to more information. I am in the US and I watched the entire 7 hour house of commons discussion on gay marriage. It was illuminating. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZNpzdkzWIA

Having access to views other than you own can be a freeing thing. Some though don't want their views challenged and rely solely on 'faith'. 

Conservatives don't generally like facts - hence why they want text books not to mention evolution, cut library funding, why they only listen to those who espouse their own 'beliefs'. The internet opens up the world to a sharing of information and knowledge - which directly challenges conservatives and is one reason they don't like it and find it 'liberal'. Facts aren't liberal, but the right sure does like to call em that. 
























 I'll be 50 this year and I still think about Susan Dey at times :) She was my 'teen idol' (though not the only one).  









 Consider this. One of the things they often ask (not saying always, honestly not sure but I have seen it asked on the forms) is if you have ever had sex with another male. Suppose you were molested as a kid/teen. You answer yes and suddenly your aren't able to donate/sell blood. 

It was (last time I looked) overly broad. Not to mention you could be much older and you fooled around when you were a teen, etc and so on.

Broad policy is too broad. It's as simple as that.
 














 Probably because in toledo, when people die, they always go somewhere better. So the mean folks there let you live just to be jerks ;) 




 Wow, that article was just stupid - looks like an angry kid wrote it.

Then again, no one ever accused deadbart of being journalism. It is simply partisan hype for people who don't like facts and want to emotionally charge up their feelings on issues.

I would be interested in talking to some people who take them seriously though. Would be an interesting conversation. 














 Toledo might be worse :) 
























 Good. 


































 Professor Falken says: "The Bees" 









 That is so he can hook up with the ISIS folks that Obama is stashing just over the border. He is flying them in using the stolen libyan jets the right was warning us about last year. Once here they will finish the job of helping Obama spread ebola using illegal immigrant kids from south America that isis trained - and as our population dies off from the ebola Obama will be able to establish his caliphate. 

It's all so obvious, why don't libtards see it like them super smart conservatives?? 




 I don't, but you might check ghostery if you are using that as it may be blocking the widget used.  
























 The one with a single unnamed source? Yeah, guessing not as reliable as some want it to be. The same people who still think that Benghazi happened the way the right portrayed it back in the day will probably believe this without question though. 














 Don't really agree. Yes, I am disappoint in some of his actions (like this one, drones, etc) but overall I don't think this admin stands against 'everything' libs/progs want. Gays in the military, something done with health care (though not single payer), leaving Iraq, not going to war in Syria and Iran...plenty of positive compared to if we had a republican in power.

I am an independent who leaned republican in the 80's an 90's - but since then repubs have went batshit crazy. George Bush was worst president in my 50 years of life and I can't imagine someone like cruz being president.

I'll take a bad dem over anything the crazy party has to offer any day. Hell, I'd take UK's David Cameron over any US person currently running on the repub side.  





























  *Blacks and Latinos make up just more than a third of the citys population, yet those groups made up nearly two-thirds of the citys traffic stops, including searches.*

I am guessing that if they stopped and searched people of other races the same amount they might find the same issues that crop up here. 

 Cordell shows that police have pulled over, searched and handcuffed blacks and Latinos at higher rates last year than their share of the citys overall population.

When you grow up in an area like this and you are stopped more often than whites, cuffed, etc, it may have some affect on you. If 10% of the people driving have an open container, pot, etc in the car and you pull over one race more than another...chances are you will get more of that race going to jail. Which then leads people to say "See, higher crime, more cops there to catch them!" which just feeds the original problem. 







































 One show I have never seen, but one had a hard time escaping it's cultural impact and references. I am sure other shows will take it's place. 

Maybe they should make a show where people try to make show like Idol and the winner gets it funded :) 









 I wonder if they spend much time talking about how Laura Bush killed someone and how she felt about that? Probably not - because, as I recall, after the bush failure and 9/11 happened the right was telling us that we needed to be real Americans/Patriots and stand behind Bush.

They don't like Obama because he beat them twice, which has really brought out the nutcases. Look at their reactions to 9/11 and Beghazi as but one example out of hundreds. It's not rational - it requires people to be emotionally unsettled.

They let hate fuel them and toss out their principles in favor of it. They rally behind theocracy loving people like ted cruz and act like and American isis because they fear god will send hurricanes/etc on America because gay marriage. That is not rational - but they firmly believe god himself cares and will punish America. 




 Conservatives lose on the issues and logic, so they appeal to baser things like emotion. Look at the whole Benghazi debacle - been investigate and it hurt their feelings that it didn't find what they had all been claiming. So they cried a lot and investigated more. And they keep doing it.

They emotionally got behind an Iraq war, believed lies, and cheered on expansion of powers for the government with patriot act/tsa/etc. It made them feel patriotic (compare to the ACA, they love to call it Obama care, but the Patriot act they shy away from connecting bush to).

Another emotion they live with is fear. They are afraid of immigrants, isis, blacks, and non-christian people. People like Rush and Hannity know this and play on those fears - and cons tune in en masse to be preached to by father figures who tell them everything will be alright if just pray, wave flags, buy more bombs, and help less people in need. 




 The article is BS, but assuming it were true I guess it means I wouldn't vote for Obama next election.

PS - Really wouldn't care if it were true, Bush is still walking around a free man after the Iraq war BS so Obama has a long way to go before republicans can complain. 




 It's a fake site. Sad. Figure most people would know this already, LOL. 




 It's a plane. It's function is safely deliver paying customers from one point to another. It's not a danged carnival ride. 

If the Captain felt something would, in some manner, bring potential harm to either other passengers or the plane, he had a duty to act on it.

What would Captain Kirk/Picard/Kangaroo do? 









 Weird, more came in under bush than Obama - was he spouting nonsense like this back then to his little sheep?

Between him, beck, rush, hannity, levin, and fox is it any wonder people think of conservatives as idiots these days? All emotional drivel for their mindless masses. 









 Yeah, and I want cops to stop harassing and killing people. Maybe when that happens I will lend an ear to what they are whining about now. 
























 Dumb. The prof. should have had students get naked in order to join the class instead. Makes more sense to me... 




 This is brilliant. Probably the most brilliant thing you have ever posted. 









 "First, Tommy, let's do some tests. See if you can put that round peg of yours in the right hole." 














 I am going to make a guess here and say he is a conservative/fundie.

Those folks need to put down their torches and come out of the caves and meet the 21st century and realize the world is bigger than their bigotry. 




 Dang, she raised more than an Indiana pizza shop. The right was all about how awesome it was...wonder if they think the same about this. Huh. We will see. 




 Suddenly, because of jeebus, some on the right are against their fellow humans being free to enter into contracts with each other and having those contracts recognized by the government. 

Going by their views divorced people shouldn't be allowed to marry, non believers to believers, etc and so on.

I don't get it. Well, I kind of do. These super smart people are sure that God will rain down destruction on the US if gays can marry (even though they can in many countries). God doesn't care about the sick and poor being screwed over, wars like Iraq, crime, and so on. Nope. Just gays.

Your god sucks and you don't truly believe in him (Heck, based on the fundies we don't need a military, God will just swoop down and destroy the bad people....oh wait...the right pushes for more military. Maybe because they think their god is a wimp?) 




 Yes...It will liberate you from your rights, your lands, your own religious ideals, and in some cases - your life.

It is interesting, to me anyway, how the rw fundies in this country now claim that Christianity is 'better' and more liberal than it was before (which they state when talking about Islam/Isis/etc).

Which basically says: "Yeah, we changed our faith and beliefs, but we won't do that now. And we believe that other faiths aren't as advanced/liberal as ours is now. But we hate liberals and progressive ideals."

Your faith was wrong before, you reformed it time and time again, and yet now you think it is all ok and doesn't need to change anymore. I am a little skeptical. 









 A good and free, short, book about that from 1877:

https://archive.org/details/TheDevilhisOrigingreatnessandDecadence 









 *Nike has 26,000 U.S. employees and more than 1 million workers in 700 contract factories worldwide that manufacture its shoes.*

So give them the ability to hire more low wage or slave labor across Asia and they will toss in 10k jobs here. Yeah. OK. They are based here, have 1 million employees elsewhere, but only 26k here in their own country. Something just isn't adding up imho. 















































































 He should have just said "The perp and I made eye contact and it scared me. Scaring a cop is a shooting offense. I only had a split second to make a decision...was that a gun on his belt or a cell phone?" 







































 If you think that is bad, look at how some are freaked out by us not having a white president. It is like every talk radio station and conservative blog/'news' station/etc are constantly trying to get him impeached over everything.

Now it's "Jade Helm" or some such crap. They will investigate Benghazi way more than 9/11/2001 just because. He wasn't born in the US. He will, without a doubt, use his powers to take every gun in the US and crash the stock market, etc....

You can only cry wolf so many times before people laugh at you. 




 But, but....It's Jeebus! 







































 Oh, I am fine with backlash here. But fox is about as biased as they come and aren't doing anything here to 'debate' an issue but to back up what they and others already feel about the left. As one can see they grabbed this from The Daily Caller - an obvious RW blog.

Fox isn't really 'reporting' on it. They grabbed a little blurb from another site and pushed that narrative with no context (which they don't need, most fox viewers just need headlines and a blurb and they are sold on something). 




 Difference is - this guy doesn't represent most on the left. The right is a small tent made up of fundies and people who all think mostly alike. Hate muslims, don't want to allow their fellow american citizens (gays) to serve their country or get married, think all poor people are lazy welfare bums, etc.

I can find wackos on the left to be sure (am an independent and have been registered so since 1984 - though I did vote for both reagan and bush) but they represent less of the group because there is less group think on the left and more fractured 'tents' (some are pro gun, some anti, some religious, some not, etc and so on).

Pick any given conservative and you will find they represent a large chunk of them.  




 Oh, I have a problem with it - and also with who is pimping it and why. It's fox news, they are feeding their sheep with this to try and reenforce the bias of those who watch their 'show'.  




 SO, some guy I have never heard of says something silly and fox blows their dog whistle for their obedient, mindless, folks and they come running.

Man...they know how to manipulate their audience very well (not hard when their thinking skills boil down to 'someone with red/white/blue in their newscasts told me what I believe!') 




 The things which are harming Americans the GOP loves and embraces by blaming those people for it.

The things we already have defense against and aren't killing us they want to spend money on.

All in the name of Jesus. Because we all know true conservative fundies believe you can pray away sickness, being homeless, hungry etc - but you can't rely on a weak god to protect you so you have to spend money on weapons. 
























 Well, since women are physically different than men I can see some of their uniforms reflecting that. The universe isn't unisex. I am guessing fat storm troopers would need a modified uniform as well - but we only ever see thin guys in them. Diversity is lacking at times in that regards :) 




 I don't see the 'sexualized' part of it. Do some people think that a woman can't be both appealing (to some anyway) and a storm trooper? That seems a tad prejudiced IMHO. 

"Oh hey, you look pretty and have a nice body, therefore you should be working in the Cantina serving drinks to space pirates."

Yeah. No. 







































 Sure. Soon as we stop waving it every time we kill people we don't like in wars started on lies, when we stop torturing people and acting like animals, and when it means something decent and not screw the gays, the poor, the sick. 

I think the flag is used too much by people as a blinder. It is like when they turn on fox news and are blasted with red/white/blue which is code for 'it's ok to lie, just look at these colors and you will believe'.  


































 "No, there is another." 




 They will say "See, this will help those people get rich! We can suck up all their water and pull more of the chemicals we need to find oil and free the US from foreign oil dependency. A win-win for us all when we recycle your well water for you." 



















 Sure. Now that people are aware of the suit they can join in and maybe settle for a case of Blue Moon :) 





























 I am not sure I have ever drank hot dog water to know. I will take your word for it :) 




 Dang, it's that easy to get gold? I have been doing it wrong all this time :)

Since no one really ever sees me drink beer I can drink what I like without concerning myself what others think. And if someone wants to complain about my choice they are free to buy me the beer they want me to drink. 




 I'll be keeping an eye on you ;) 





























 Because republicans just want to get the "truth",  they keep finding it, but it isn't what they wanted.  
























 Honestly, I don't care either way. I just come here to post and comment on some news/politics/and a few other things. The bot picked me up. I get all replies to my mail, and it sent like 5/7 messages. Never heard of it, you, etc, and honestly don't give a shit either way.

But looking at reddit rules and such I would speculate that the 'joke' isn't seen as a joke and more as an attempt at harassment of others. Which no one really wants. If you are looking for a reason why one bot is allowed and one is not that seems like the most likely reason.

Just putting my 2 cents in. I do find it funny though that is labeled me/inferred I am some sort of SJW. Now that is a hoot. Damn, people on liberal boards tell me I am libertarian/a little right, conservatives think I am a flaming liberal (not fond of modern day cons myself, more old school and perhaps closer to some UK style cons on some issues).

I really don't care enough about people on reddit and their opinions to bother with bots. But to each their own. Just wish they would leave me out of it.
 




 As stated above:

Primary purpose of this bot is used to cross-reference subs commonly associated with SJWs, in addition to finding patterns in the subs left-wing users use. Uses are for identifying concern trolls, potentially identifying alts, identifying cuckolds so that one may talk to their SOs for bulltastic times , and just fun and curiousity.

 **Duggar cached website: "Rape and incest represent heinous crimes and as such should be treated as capital crimes"**

Q. What is your abortion position, and specifically, where do you stand on rape, incest, and threat to the mothers health?

A. If a woman is raped, the rapist should be executed instead of the innocent unborn baby. Adoption is an option. Many couples would love to adopt and are waiting for a baby. Abortion has been and always will be the destruction of an innocent child. Rape and incest represent heinous crimes and as such should be treated as capital crimes. The developing infant committed no crime and should be allowed to live. In the unlikely event that the life of both mother and baby would both be lost (for example, a tubal pregnancy) all should be done to save the life of the mother.

 Maybe because they banned it first over spam, relented, then looked at what it said it's stated purpose was - which wasn't spam. Part of it's 'purpose' was to gather information to use to contact the SO's of people on it's list.

That isn't spam. That is harassment.  




 I was pegged by that bot. I mostly post in politics and news (sometimes star wars).

If you want to know why the bot was banned maybe you should take a look at the description the bot had and not it's function. There is a telling item in it and it's stated purpose. 




 Is he related to the Duggars? 




 **Puts on tea party/rw fundie hat**

We better give them what they want. If we don't, god won't bless the USA and will strike us down. If you don't believe us, ask our super smart members to explain to you folks where hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, droughts, etc come from - God..he is punishing us for gays. 

Elect us and god will bless us again as we give Israel anything it wants, drive out the gays and immigrants, end all aid to the poor, sick, hungry, and make life hell for those in prison - just like Jeebus demanded we do! 









 **Puts on conservative hat** 

You all need to pull yourselves up by your bootstraps. Just work harder, get two jobs! Why should I give you welfare? Don't like where you are living? Move somewhere else with better opportunities and less violence. Git r done! 









 How about we just quit getting in to wars in the first place. Problem solved. 




 And you don't get to assault citizens. Fair enough. Now let's look at what happens when either group do so. 




 Ah, Rick and the conservative platform: Save america from hurricanes, floods, etc - ban gays and push prayer as the solution to poverty, healthcare, everything except defense (for that, they don't put trust in god but in ammo - god can wipe out sinners/gays with 'natural' disasters but he is powerless against terrorism, russia, china, etc. Man..their god is weird). 




 Internet troll eh. Let me guess, he is a conservative.  *Checks article*

Yep.  *after asking for funds to "take out" the civil rights activist DeRay McKesson* 














 Yes. How many people speed per day? Do you want to hire enough cops to sit at every mile marker to catch them all? It is gonna cost more - and we know the conservatives in this country would only raise taxes for killing humans in other countries, so how would we pay for properly enforcing the law? 




 Funny, an NDN I know who is a SJW and an attorney on a rez sent this to me. If she isn't offended I'll try not to be. 

















































 All religions are just things people made up to make themselves feel better and/or a method to control people. It's all about fear - fear satan, fear god, fear muslims, fear people not like us (color/sex/etc).

Islam and Christianity are just two branches of the same tree that peddle fear and ignorance of others to justify their actions. Cut down the tree if you ever really want to get some real peace on earth. 




 Demographics: Citizens with guns shooting other citizens.

Since we don't pay citizens and they don't work for us there isn't really much we can do about it other than what we already are. If the people we employ are shooting folks there is a lot more we are empowered to do about it.

Can't control everyone else, but the people who are supposed to answer to us we should be able to. Oddly enough, conservatives are the ones who most get in the way and try to shield employees who don't do their jobs properly.

People with power (guns) abuse that power and we arrest them, give them a trial, send them to jail.

People with power (cops) abuse that power and some people set up gofundme accounts to cheer them on and claim that they just shot people because they were scared (notice they never want to look at details when it isn't cops shooting people - they just look at the numbers....) 




 And no one else ever did either. Heck, Christians are still just some small group somewhere and never went on any conquests. Think I will book me some tickets to the new world and see those 'Indians' there. Oh wait...someone killed most of them off. Probably them evil mooslims! 




 I always thought chief Wiggum was up to no good. 




 Conservatives will believe anything, and deadbart knows just which dog whistle to blow to get them all panting and running about. 














 Not fully. People break the laws all day long - every time someone speeds, doesn't use a turn signal, etc they are not obeying the law.

Police have the ability to detain/arrest people and deliver them to where justice can be served - it is all part of a process. Cops are rarely at the scene of a crime when it happens (robberies, rapes, murders, etc). They are there to be called if someone sees something going wrong or survives something.

 




 What is the role of a cop in society? They cannot protect you all of the time. They can arrest violators if they are caught in the commission of a crime. How many people are shot in the US, or stabbed, etc a year in the US?

If you believe that the cops sole job is to protect you then I don't know what to tell you.

[Justices Rule Police Do Not Have a Constitutional Duty to Protect Someone](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/28/politics/28scotus.html)  




 Why do you think they do? If you're a super smart conservative your answer might be "Cause they gets free obummer phones which never existed on earth till obummer! Git r done!"

Maybe they vote mainly with a party that doesn't despise them and is filled with racists. 




 Oh, I dunno, you must be right. Cops exist just so we won't kill each other. That is why there is one cop to one person - so they can stand around and watch to make sure we don't shoot each other.

ROFL. Riiight. I mean, if we didn't have police departments everyone would kill each other all day long (sounds rather biblical - original sin, etc). 

We have, what, about 400 cops per 100,000 people. And their job is to stop all those people from killing each other. Okey dokey.  




 Those guns got from the store to the street somehow.

So someone had to pass the background checks. 




 Wow, that's just dumb.

Especially the part " Police exist to keep pople from killing each other"

Heck, maybe the problem is all the gun owners shooting people there, eh? :)
 














 I can understand that. I don't think I ever watched Full House (may have seen a show or two with one of my kids, the people look familiar in it). I have never seen American Idol either and lots of people seemed to think it was the bee's knees.

It's not that I don't like TV I am just picky in what I watch (Twin Peaks, Broadchurch, Doctor Who, The Wire, Mork and Mindy, and as you mentioned Air Wolf). 

Now I feel old. * Shakes fist at computer* Get off my grass, and my screen! 




 A 'friend' of mine watched it. Said it was fun but didn't understand how she had pierced her ears. 




 I can see that the full retard division has shown up.

You know, the basic "If you help people it will encourage people to become homeless to get free stuff" brigade.

Right. Because people want to be homeless for a year or more and suffering just to get a cheap place to live * facepalm* 

Reminds of how conservatives have been preaching that if we extend unemployment benefits people won't look for work, and then turn around and claim there aren't any jobs because of evil ole Obama. Again, thinking that people enjoy taking huge cuts in pay and having an uncertain future.

These are the same folks who yammer on about us needing to pay more money for more wars so that we can have peace. We inaded Iraq? Let's do it again! And hey, while over there let's hit up Iran too.

Maybe those countries don't want us to invade them, maybe they don't want our 'help', and maybe a lot of us don't want to spend money on more wars and killing but actually helping people here - because it isn't terrorism or Iraq that is causing the pain/suffering/death here. 

Dear conservatives, stop being so damn stupid when it comes it basic crap so many other countries get right. Like health care/single payer. You want to save American lives, focus on what is actually killing them (hint: it isn't terrorism or 'laziness'). 




 It will be like with the cops. "I thought he had a gun/wmd/etc, so I am excused for shooting him a hundred times even though there wasn't a weapon."

Basically, the bush doctrine. 




 LOL - only a conservative with an agenda would buy that.

Tell us, what are the actual numbers? Ohhh 70% - scary (if you can't think for yourself and watch fox).

 




 Define "Qualified". 




 Yeah, but it was because... "reasons". 

Only in the US do we find people not outraged by this, or at the best, questioning of it.

The pat, conservative, response is "They didn't stop, so they had it coming!" Yeah. Maybe we need to rethink how we do some police work here - but saying that, to some, means you are a flaming liberal who hates cops and wants a lawless society. 




 And that is, imho, a part of the problem: "Sides".

LEO's see themselves, in general, as part of a group. If you don't support them, you are against them. I was 'punished' at times when I was one because I wasn't always on the 'cop' side. But then I was young and idealistic. I saw it as a job. Others saw it as a life style choice and the teams were us and people who weren't us. 




 Ever watch a police chase? How many end with that may shots on unarmed citizens?

Ohhhh. I see. You think cops should just unload their weapons on unarmed people. Just let their 'animal' instincts take over. After all of those shots you still think a guy should jump on the hood of the car and keep shooting. What are they, storm troopers who can't shoot straight?

Reminds me of conservatives. They want to investigate Benghazi for years but when cops kill people here just shrug and say "They had it coming". Riiight. And if you don't see how the two connect, think about this:

4 Americans died in a hot zone and the right wants someone's head for it - someone here in the US they can blame. So much so they have had multiple investigations and don't blame the people who did it, they never talk about them, but want someone in government held accountable.

Yet, right here in the US, cops can kill unarmed people - not just in this case - and the right just shrugs and blames the people killed and backs the government. 









 So obey or die. Great way to run a society, pretty much the conservative/fundie mind set. Isis approved message.

Wonder how so many other countries get by without shooting and killing their citizens? Must be a mad house in the UK, Iceland, Europe, Canada..... 




 If this were Cleveland they would just shoot them 137 times and call it a day. 




 Depends. I spoke up several times on issues, which gets IA(internal affairs) involved. It made my life hell there. 

Imagine a police force like being a very very partisan website when it comes to politics. Sometimes, people don't listen to reason and see anyone who doesn't agree as a threat - ala the old "you are with us or against us".

There has to be a will, not just by a few officers, but by the public and those in power, to take it serious. I was harassed by senior deputies (sgt/lt). It didn't help that I personally knew the sheriff and he had hired me in. Keep in mind, the sheriff is elected and comes and goes, and he/she has to play politics with those who have been there awhile. 

Police forces are, for a big part, political entities. They won't reform themselves from within. 









 We have plenty of troops - all of those militias who run about protecting the border. They are just itching to shoot up something. I am sure they will be on their way there, without even being asked, any moment now.

"Hey Billy Bob, grab you gun and wake up cooter! I done loaded up our bibles, flags, and guns. We have to save America, again. This time, it's for reals. Git r done!" 




 Mecca? Isn't that where Pee Wee lives? http://imgur.com/G7BWuca 




 I don't care how it is sliced and diced, way too many shots were fired at two unarmed people in a car. The cops probably fired more bullets at that car than the entire UK police force has fired this century.

They obviously weren't even looking, just shooting - all based on a 'belief' that the people were armed. When we stop holding cops accountable we are giving them a green light to continue on this path and we will see more of it. 

It is a sad day when you are more afraid of cops who carry guns than citizens that do. 



















 Weird. I thought he was all about rights and the constitution, etc. Equal protection under the law and all that good stuff.

Do we have mandatory interracial marriage? My x was 1/4 Indian, so maybe he is on to something. I seem to recall the Lutheran church we attended at the time being forced to marry us. It was awful.

Why do the craziest people in the US mostly belong to the republican party? 




 And lots of Americans believe in an invisible sky daddy who wants to destroy the entire US because of those gay people.

Americans are a little funny about some things (they ignore all the other sins, of course. Cause there is really only one sin the right things about all day - and it involves sex). 




 Yeah, I know some people don't believe in excessive force and such. And others are fine with cops just shooting people who don't pull over (See it all the time, right? So it must be the standard procedure you endorse). 




 *Biden says that during the transition, he was warned not to expect any cooperation on many votes. I spoke to seven different Republican Senators, who said,*
 *"Joe, Im not going to be able to help you on anything," he recalls. His informants said (Senate Minority Leader Mitch) McConnell had demanded unified resistance. The way it was characterized to me was: `For the next two years, we cant let you succeed in anything. Thats our ticket to coming back, Biden says.*  




 They want to see Obama fail (ala republicans/rush/etc) because if his policies succeeded it would mean that the conservative ones were wrong. So they worked against the US doing better. 

They care about one thing - winning elections. And when they win they want to work to dismantle things from science to epa. Their whole philosophy is stuck in the stone ages and based on 'just pray - god will save us. Oh, and give us money for more weapons, cause we really don't believe god will save us'.

They used 9/11 to make wars, patriot act, tsa, and to consolidate more power - power which, suddenly, they think is wrong since Obama is president. Now, again - rather suddenly, they want lots of investigations into an attack. Something they didn't want much of when it came to 9/11 ("Don't criticize the president, we were attacked, real patriots would stand by him and wave flags!"). 




 "Defend the country." Riiiight. What were we defending it from?

Was it Iraq's massive air force/navy attacking us? Ooops. Probably not. This is why conservatives side with cops - if you are scared, shoot someone and claim it was "Defense".

China and Russia are bigger threats to us than the ME, yet we didn't launch wars against them. Remember that 'cold' war? It stayed cold because more intelligent people were in charge. 




 So, 2 unarmed people, 130 shots fired, 2 people dead, and the cops were just doing their job.

OK. As a former leo myself I am left asking "Wonder why people have problems with cops?" and the answer seems more and more clear all the time. 

I guess the lesson is - shoot all you want, just tell folks you were reasonably scared, and you have nothing to worry about. Unless, of course, you are a lowly citizen and not a government employee. 









 I am going to miss Ireland. According to conservatives here in the US god will be mad now. Jeebus will send storms, earthquakes, etc to punish the entire country. It will probably sink beneath the waves. 

I wish we all could be smart scientists like conservative fundies and understand nature better. Word of advice, when god starts destroying Ireland, run. Don't look back, or you will turn into salt as punishment. If we hadn't kick god out of the schools more people would understand this. 




 I don't even really blame people who voted to authorize use of force. It was bush who used it, who kept us there, who controlled and ran the war. He was, as he might say, 'the decider'. It rests on no one's shoulders but his own. 









 As an independent who voted reagan and bush I find that funny.

A large part of the republican party is incompetent. From Iraq to religion to everything in between, conservatives don't tend to think for themselves anymore and are more interested in screwing over the US and playing politics than they are in actual working to better the country.

They are regressive socially, prefer corporations over their own country, want to remove just about every regulation and regress us back to the times when rivers would catch fire from pollution. 












































 They have already determined that there weren't stand down orders, etc and so on. Republicans care more about benghazi than they ever did 9/11 - but then, they don't really care about the US, just punishing those who aren't like them; from gays to democrats the right is still crying over their losses to Obama and work against the US for their party.

Patriotism is just a word they use to control the weak minded folks who vote for them. Wave your flag, clutch your bible, and cheer on sending troops to be injured and killed. It's what those 'patriots' do. 




 We'll get right on that soon as bush and cheney are behind bars. Don't hold your breath. 



















 I am shocked they didn't shoot him 40 times, or at least beat him a lot.

Police forces are becoming (more of) an embarrassment in this country. 




 Um, doesn't appear to be "Live" 




 And she was right. 
























 I think you summed up my own feelings quite nicely. 







































 Wrong. One is about people who were born a certain way, one is about people who chose to be a certain way. 




 It doesn't have to say anything - it is obvious from his sign.

And how does he know they are 'Mexican'? Because they don't look like him? Oh...right. The only country where people 'look' like that is Mexico.

Yeah, that screams conservative. 




 Let me guess. He is a conservative. 




 Naw, don't even recall the name - just thought it funny that someone would say that when losing an argument. It was the only thing they said that resembled being truthful/intelligent. 




 If not indicted, then conservatives/fox/rush/etc would all be out yelling, "See! I told you they did nothing wrong, this proves it!"

Now it will be "You can indict a ham sandwich, so this means nothing!" 




 Hmm, wonder if it is that guy who swore he would follow me around reddit and downvote every single thing I posted because he lost an argument with me? That would be funny :) 



















 Yeah, not quite like Fox articles where it's all lies and a headline, which some people seem to have a need for :) 

Concise, simple, and was a breaking news item (but you aren't allowed to say that in the title here). I will note, for those who may need this information, a website called "google" will assist you in learning more about something if honestly interested.

Some sarcasm in all of that, perhaps. 




























































































































 Funny - I wasn't talking about Obama. Typical of cons; can't read and comprehend. Try it again and let me know if you need any help. 




 Ah...libs. Those damn people who care about freedom for folks to marry, against silly wars, want to be able to work together to provide health care/etc for fellow humans like other countries.

Nothing like conservatives. 




 This isn't new. It was reported on 9/13/2012 by CNN (and presumably others).

I guess it is new to people who only cared to hear what they wanted back then and because con news sources were all whining about the video and obama not using the word 'terror' seconds after the attack.

Once more, the right got played by their own news outlets who distracted them.

Even Hillary noted it was a small group (which they were):

http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/12/world/africa/libya-attack-jihadists/

Elsewhere we see that there were folks saying it could have been a planned attack but no one was sure "at that point" (kind of like how folks aren't always sure a cop shooting someone was justified at that point until they investigate).

The admin also said they didn't think it was Al Qaeda, which it wasn't. And "He stressed Zawahiri's threat was only three lines in a forty something minute video tape. Given the language in the tape, analysts would tend not to have concluded an immediate attack was likely."

 LOL this is NEW??? Jeebus. On Sept 13th CNN reported on this.

 Meh, Karma doesn't really translate to much. I don't like the way cops get away with crap here in the US, used to be one and hated it back then (the 80's). The right seems to worship government employees with guns - when I wish they were as critical of them as they pretend to be of some other people in power they say abuse their power. 




 I can have one because I used to be one - isn't that how it works? 




 Not an attorney, but I spent the night in a holiday express last night. 

I would say, send them a link to this story on a check (in the memo) for 0.01 cents. See what happens. 




 Han shot first.  




 Orcas...the cops of the ocean. 




 So having all these nukes doesn't deter anyone. Good to know, we can sell em all off.

 And conservatives aren't liking seeing their fellow humans being allowed to be married, free, not in wars, etc. It also irks them that they can't have their own brand of isis/theocracy in power here....

See, this is easy. 
























 Weird. I heard the only people in the US who hated cops were blacks/liberals. Looks like them responsible gun owner whites are the ones shouting to kill cops (reminds me of waco....) 




 Not just the cops - conservatives. If this were a group of black people doing this all we would hear about is "welfare, absent dads, crime rate amongst blacks" and so on and so on.

Then, someone would bring up "Black on Black crime" and whine like little babies about how "Black people don't get upset when citizens kill each other but do when government employees do" as though it means something (in other words, they will ask things like 'why aren't blacks protesting other blacks killing each other?' as though that is even close to an intelligent question).

Now imagine the bikers were muslims....jeeebus, it would be all over fox, every single forum on the net, with people screaming.

White folks do crime? Meh. They don't represent Christians, gun owners, or straight people. They are seen as individuals with problems.

Conservatives aren't exactly smart folks though. 




 I find his comment on names interesting as well. Has he heard the name 'Barack'? 





























 Leslie Neilsen did it better:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP7F7Uw6yP4 




 Maybe it works like this: God takes all the water, using his magic, from one place then drops it on another. He likes spreading the punishment around.

Conservative fundies call the above 'Science' and it is what they want taught in school.  









 Betting they get Agent Cooper on the case. Any witnesses see a one armed man? 




 Ah, typical republican. "We agree to open a public business but we shouldn't have to honor the 'public' contract part of it. 'Cause we are special, jeesbus tells us so! And if we serve gays it will make god all angry and he will kill people in the US with storms and quakes!"

Yeah, not dealing with people playing with a full deck. I expect him to say something like that. Now the good little conservatives will rush to give him a gold star or little American flag next to his name. "He respects jeebus and isn't a muslim born in kenya who ordered stand down orders in Benghazi - all of which we proved about Obama."

Good lord, why do these type of people even get votes and who would actually vote for them? 




 He wants it to be like that. All the cons want to do is sell fear - for more patriot act, tsa, more spending on weapons. All the while ignoring the things which actually impact people here in a negative way an harm them. From poverty to health care to just about everything else. 

The American Taliban just wants to push jeebus, 'christian values', and the idea that the only problems, ever, in the US are because people are just lazy. All the while believing that companies can do no wrong, never do, and if we just remove all epa regulations companies would hire people and never, ever, harm our water supplies, air, and so on.

Not smart people - he would be a good leader for such folks. 
























 Because republicans want to save more money to give to Israel (apparently, both Israel and God don't have their own bootstraps).

The RW believes that people need an incentive to work and that all humans on earth who get aid are just lazy, but will run out and get the jobs they claim Obama lost if you make em suffer more.

Conservative fundies aren't known for their intellect and respond  to emotion and religion (the poor should pray more and rely on Churches and god, like the right does for the defense of the US....oh wait...they spend money like drunken sailors on ways to kill people. They actually have zero faith in god.) 




 Now imagine much of the populace listens to fox news and believes it. 14 years after 9/11 the only thing they talk about is the benghazi episode on 9/11 where most people died, bush was a hero, etc and so on.

Between hannity, rush, levin, fox news, and the emperor I can easily see why people might discount facts and history - because some people are just dumb. Han probably listened to a rw con radio show all day while flying in the Falcon ;)

(It's a joke people) 




 She voted, wrongly imho, to give bush the authority to go to war.

He abused that authority. Now people want her to be responsible for what he did? Where were those people back then and up until 2008? 




 Yeah....no.

The US is so far behind other countries on this it isn't even funny.

I have 5 kids, with a few different ladies, over my near 50 years. Each one is different. Pregnancy and child birth are different for each person. 

Conservative types tend to try to make things simple and compact based on the few. Hence why they are so regressive on things. 

Which is funny - because when it comes to religion (for example) they go on 'belief' and get upset when challenged. When it comes to protestors about government (police) abuses they call everyone looters. When it comes to women having kids they think of them as simple factories and want those women back out and 'producing' again in no time.

And yeah - I agree, add matching time for mother and father. Try having a wife really sick (who, btw, died some years later because of her health issues) and being punished by the company you are working for because you took one day over the allotted 3 to care for her.

Conservatives like to make everything about their real god - money.  



























































 Should they arrest god when women have a miscarriage?

Gotta love the American Taliban. 




 *What's the problem?*   
  I closed firefox today and restarted (as I have had to do several times now) and lost all my shortcuts. This is the second time I have lost them but not the second time I have had to restart firefox for an issue. This doesn't happen when firefox crashes. Just when I quit/force quit.

*What other browser extensions are installed?*  
  Adblocker and ghostery.

*Did you read the known issues and search /r/RESissues?*  
  Yes. I found an issue from a year ago which related to a file on windows. I am on a mac, have most updated version of this software, and am not sure it applies here.

I also get the tips again popping up, so yes, I am sure some file somewhere is being toasted with my settings. Do I need to write a script to back it up several times a day as different names or will a future version do this?

 Oh good, so they took money away from an anti-gay church?

Good idea :) 














 You can tell it is old, she is smoking in a diner. Hard to find that these days. 














 Yeah, they consider it 'stealing' when you get in the way of the city fining someone. Wonder if they have any speed traps in that area and if flashing your headlights to warn people is illegal there? 




 He is probably one of the kids who work in a sweatshop making the products and he was there inspecting them and putting his inspector stickers on stuff. 




 Do you know who you are voting for? We could compare records...raygun, bush, clinton, bush, kerry, obama (I don't vote straight party ticket ever).

You know, if the right had huntsman running I would vote for him, and would have in 2012 if the idiots hadn't picked romney.

I don't worship a party so I don't have to kiss their ass and can point out how the two are alike. Both sides hate that. 




 Independent, not sure who I am voting for yet. But I am amused about how the right whines like little babies on the one hand then ignore the same if not worse on the other.

 









 Is what she did legal or not?

If so, who cares. Operate within the law to maximize your benefits. It's the way of things in America now. 









 When the right whines about the Koch brothers buying elections, laws, and candidates I will take them serious about being upset about this. Not to mention superpacs, corporations are people, etc.

Till then, they should quit crying about it because it makes em look stupid. 









 If he can tie it to the bible he might get some traction.

Barring that, I doubt anyone on the right will care. 




 Should have pepper sprayed the food, might give it some flavor.

Last time I was in CA and had del taco I couldn't finish eating it, made Taco Bell seem like gourmet food. 









 Been seeing the right pimp that. I guess it goes like this:

"Someone called the cops because two people were fighting. So the cops were justified in how they acted towards everyone else there who wasn't involved."

They want to distract from the actions of that cop and not a single one has yet to explain to me how this new video changes the other one at all. 




 Perhaps. I post a lot of links. But then I am a news junkie, follow about 700 tv news station on one twitter list and a bunch on another. All the while listening to radio (am mostly and some short wave) and surfing various websites.

Just a hobby :) 




 Why would someone use a submission bot anyway? Good grief, how hard is it to cut and paste a title and link? 




 I think this oldie sums it up well. America. Fuck yeah.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGQaH3-LK54 














 And we don't hear about all the people who don't kill others, who own guns and don't shoot anyone, etc. News use covers the not so normal things. Weird, I know.... 
































































 It was constructive. People believe all sorts of things and never stop to think about how silly and over the top they are. There is a pattern of such with a certain group of people. 




 I read it. Now what? 




 LOL. Right. And we were supposed to believe we would all die from ebola, christians would be put in fema camps, the stock market would crash, all the guns in the US would be confiscated and outlawed, Obama ordered a stand down order and watched people die in benghazi live on tv while playing golf.....

Cons will believe anything. 









 They are reflective of peoples' contributions to the community.

Someone like you, for example, is of pretty much no value and seem to just want to troll and blather on to get attention by being as much of troll as possible.

You call people 'limp dicked liberals', post BS from a site known to be pretty much lies and trolling, and in your case your karma accurately reflect your worth to people here on reddit. Which is negative. 









 All these years they didn't say a peep about this. Then, suddenly, they get their asses whipped because America is more progressive now and they want the government out of it all.

Typical sore loser conservatives. WAAAAAH! 









 Oh....I see. When a white person does a crime he has a problem and isn't 'normal'.

When a black person does a crime it is because they are black/ their 'culture'/etc.

Christian does a crime. Don't mention the religion. Muslim does - only mention the religion.

Sadly, that is how it works in the US these days. 




 Because polls are fickle and you can get what you want out of them many times.

Remember how well romney was doing according to the right wing? Back in 2012 he was gonna clean up, decimate Obama....I still remember fox/rove election night. They seemed honestly shocked (that's what happens when you live in a bubble).

 




 Well, you have 1 whole link karma - so how about you just post more news you want to see? It isn't hard to do.

Good thing about reddit, people decide what they want, others don't do it for them. 




 Using Hillary and Squealing in the same sentence does not, in any way, enthuse me at all. Now I have dueling banjos stuck in my head. 



















 Hillary/Bush 2016. Just to screw with everyone. 

That way we can go to war with Iran and increase taxes on the wealthy to pay for the war they want and will profit from.

Ted Cruz can head up the DOD, Chris Christie can be made project manager for infrastructure projects, Jindal can head the education department, Walker can head up health and human services or the labor department, and Bernie Sanders can do whatever the hell he wants. 




 From 2013?

Seems just a tad old. But then, just yesterday I was sitting on the porch talking to a friend about bush and 9/11, iraq, etc which devolved into a discussion about the Carter Administration and bi-centennial celebration and the freedom train. 




 well done :) 




 The day of our wedding I watched Charlie and the Chocolate factory. I haven't watched it since then (that was 1985). 









 "Be in the world, not of it."

I don't care one wit what someone's faith is or how they choose to live, or if they choose to be subject to rules of their church/synagogue/mosque. I only care when they decide that what they believe, based on fear of their god, is something they want to push on the rest of society. 




 Actually, you are posting to yourself right now. There is no reddit. No thread. It's all in your head.... 




 Refuse a design, fine. Refuse to even make a product you sell to others? Not fine. 




 Looks like I was right. Poster/troll is gone. 









 If the science is sound, it's sound. But like all science reports, it can be 'tainted' by conflicts of interest. 

I'll side with the epa on this one, same as I side with scientists/government studies about climate change and humankind's contributing to it.

Gonna be fun to see if the right runs with this while on the other hand dismissing other EPA studies :) 




 I rarely wash it. I do choke it at times though. 




 If not, let me know....lol 




 Won't work - I can't read Russian :) 




  "Privacy, above all other things, including safety and freedom from terrorism, is not where we want to go," Steinbach said.

Tell you what. When you give us all access to what the government is doing (tpp/emails/etc) maybe we will think about it. When you think you are the only ones who should have privacy and be protected it make us citizens a tad wary of your intentions. 




 I don't think I am the one here who seems silly.

I get it, you think of kids like animals to be trained.

And I know 13 year old kids are smart, have 5 kids (youngest is 14) and never once raised a hand to one, cut their hair to punish them, etc. Rational people can handle things in a rational manner.

When you have to resort to such things you are doing something wrong. 




 You seem to be trolling this thread - is this something you have done and now feel a need to defend it?

This dad abused his power - I am guessing he is a conservative that feels cops can kill who they want for any reason and that punishment of any form is 'love'. Probably a fundie as well.... 









 My x and I were out driving not long after we had met:

Me: "You're not seeing anyone else right now are you?"

Her: "Uh, no."

Me: "Neither am I. And since we are here together, going to get some food, I guess it means we are seeing each other now."

Her: "Uh. Well, yes. I really can't argue with that."

sometime later on a trip home from visiting relatives for the holiday...

Me: "Ya know, since we hang out a lot and you have nothing better to do and neither do I, why don't we get married?"

Her: "Well...OK. We might as well. When do you want to do it?"

Me: "You pick, I'm easy."

Her: "How about in May?"

Me: "Sounds good to me."

We were married 10 years, had 3 kids, and she died 10 years ago from a serious of birth defects she was born with. She did reject my idea of having chicken nuggets at the reception...can't win em all. 







































 People get famous for lying and making crap. I think she will give the Kardashian's a run for their money. America. Fuck Yeah. 









 He cares or he wouldn't have made the comment.

Pro-tip for you Huck: If it doesn't affect your life, keep your mouth shut. Gay marriage, abortion, gays in the military, sex change operations, etc doesn't impact your life unless you make it do so. 




 Good job. Nice line work/colors and very crisp.  




 Forgot about that one. I still like ole ZZT at times, but hard to find a copy to run on the Mac. 









 Well, it IS Florida, so zombies are likely (too much sun for Vampires). 
























 Weren't conservatives, just yesterday, touting a poll about voter ID and how most wanted that? My my my...wonder if they will be pushing this one too? 









 The issue at hand is how conservatives prefer to govern and handle issues, and he does want to be president.
 




 Here's how it works with some conservatives:

 In addition to floating the new bike tax, the budget currently under consideration would repeal the states Complete Streets law. The policy, which mandates that all new road construction and repairs take cyclists and pedestrians into consideration, makes up only about $190,000, or six-one-thousandths of one percent of the total transportation budget

Now he will cut and cut and cut to the point it hurts even more. So when a dem runs part of their platform, to bring things back to sanity, is to spend. Then cons will point and say 'look, tax and spend liberals!' 

All the while, these same cons, are for spending more on weapons and wars (which they don't always put on the books....) Which, oddly enough, you never heard them discuss raising taxes to pay for (can you imagine the response by the right if cons has asked for a tax increase to pay for the wars? Suddenly they would all be like 'naw, we're safe enough').

So, what happens (again) is they increase spending for wars/weapons, cut the budget for things we really want and need, and then claim there is no money to pay for those things. 









 Interesting information, thanks.

 **Santorum, a devout Catholic, told Philadelphia radio host Dom Giordano on Monday that the pope should "leave science to the scientists."** 

Why don't you do the same, Rick? Conservatives in this country blame storms on gays, try to take science out of school texts, and don't believe the majority of scientists in the world when it comes to climate change (and claim that god controls the weather and man has no impact....Yeah, let's keep religion and politics out of science.) 







































 Uh, I don't have a credit card. I am guessing you assume every human in the US has one? Weird. 







































 Ah the rich. They work so much harder than others. You can work 60 hours a week in one job, 20 in another, and 10 on sunday and you are still being a lazy worthless bum. Hard work means money (just ask any conservative). These people are far superior to us because they busted their asses and still are 1000 hours a week.

So sure, we should listen to their ideals. They are intellectually superior and much harder workers. What have you done for America? How many factories have you closed and how many slave laborer children have you been able to put to work in the world?

Like moses they have the led the money from it's bondage in our country to freedom and tax havens elsewhere. They have climbed the mountain of the golden calf and brought down to us the tablets, phones, and shoes from the right hand of the children of Vietnam.

Verily I say unto you, the great wealth wielders of this country have shown us the way to the promised land which flows with golden showers from above, you will come to it from shit creek, upon which you will need no paddle. 

And there, at border to this land of slave labor for all, at the land where your money where no longer burden your pockets but instead will be lifted up to become the burden of the rich....there you will the rulers they have chosen to allow you to choose from.

Go now, and spread the good news.... 









 Here is their basic ideal (and why it is a sham):

We can all own our own businesses and with hard work can be rich.

If everyone owned a business, who would work for them?? We need workers.

The people in this country who get the most work the least. If we all worked 60 hours a week we all still wouldn't be making the same amount of money. So it isn't about "Hard Work". It never has been.

Those who do the actual work, the workers, at times ask for the same things investors do - a return on their 'investment'. But the right calls workers greedy when they do and whine about how prices could go up.

Investors want the same thing and prices go up? The right cheers that on as capitalism. 




 I want to do a study of my own on this. Step 1, find a woman who is a bread winner. Step 2, convince her I am worth marrying. Step 3, should be profit, but I don't think I will make it past step 2. 





























 I played chess in high school. We sold donuts and had insanity tournaments (at my house, play chess for 24 hours straight) just to raise enough money for chess boards and pieces.

If we had a 60 million dollars for our sport we would have food, hookers, and booze, for everyone who came to see our games (and we would pick em up in limos to get them there).

Pretty sure we still wouldn't get anyone to come see the games (we asked for cheer leaders, but that never happened - we even said they could just sign the cheers and the school still didn't care). 





























 Didn't say it was.

But I suppose we should keep that in mind when creating budgets (unless the treaty is with Indians, we generally don't honor those ones and are still screwing them over like McCain recently did).

It would be interesting to know exactly what all obligations we have and under what conditions. I am sure such things have an impact, somewhere along the line, on legislation, planning, funding, etc.

 Because the debate is a moot point. They already know how they are going to vote and it's all for show. 









 The constitution is like the bible. People interpret it a lot of ways.

One of the core ideals is that we have a collective interest in the security of the country. And foreign powers aren't the only thing which is a threat to the nation. Pollution from one state can easily cross state lines and impact others and deprive them of their rights, affect their health, well being, ability to farm, produce, etc. 




 I think things should be a case by case basis at times.

Pot - is something an individual does that affects themselves. And while some can argue it has broader consequences that is over broad and not consistent.

Fracking - a broader issue that can affect many people (like pollution) on a broad scale. I would be against a federal ban but for federal regulations on the safety/environmental impact side of things.


It is, in some ways, pretty simple. What impact does X have on 'we the people'. If it impacts just the people doing it, meh, okay, have fun. As the scope of the action increases so should scrutiny and regulations to minimize negative impacts. 




 Yeah, the GOP wants to take us back to the 60's and 70's where rivers caught fire, the Potomac wasn't safe to swim or fish in and algae blooms ruled the day. 

They would trade every river, fish, drinkable source of water in this country for money. It's so...I dunno, 'Christian' of that fundie party. 









 From the article:

 A few maverick Republicans even argue that the cable network has become so powerful that it's become a problem for the party, not an advantage. Bruce Bartlett, a former aide to President Reagan, wrote recently that Fox allows conservatives to engage in self-brainwashing and may have contributed to Mitt Romney's 2012 defeat by making Republicans complacent about the victory they expected.

"Self Brainwashing", I think, is quite fitting for that crowd. 
























 Well, you should keep tabs 24x7 on what is posted when so you can keep the rest of us up to date since we aren't here as much as you.

Keep up the good work and the excellent commentary. I will make sure to message you before posting anything again (and can you keep track of people I ignore and what they post as well? Thanks! We all need and appreciate your hard work and keeping tabs on all of this).

PS - never friended anyone on here before, but added you so I can run my postings by you each day. Thanks for the awesome help!! 




 Fox wants to turn the story/dialogue around because these people are known as fundie christians and conservatives.

They have to protect their own. It will be a fluff piece and fundies will start a gofundme shortly after it. 




 Yes - now, suddenly, the right isn't running all about waving flags and bibles to support it.

Which I am actually glad about. Maybe now they see why so many were against it all back then (and maybe they will pay attention to the left who is still against it and not on board with Obama on this issue). 














 The more laws you have, the more law breakers you have.

How many laws do Americans break a day? From speeding to pirated movies/music, to selling VHS tapes you have of old shows at a garage sale you didn't get a permit for and didn't put down on your taxes to....well, just about everything.

I am guessing that almost every US citizen has broken the law more than once. We only take notice of those the government chooses to prosecute. And then we make their life hell - from making it hard to get a job, loans, etc.

If you want to break the law - just call yourself a corporation. At least then the most you usually get is a fine which is less than the money you made from your crimes. 




 insert dog whistle pic here

"Foundation **took**" - no, some groups/people donated.

I can see the super smart conservatives now "Why, a smart charity like the ones I donate to, would refuse all money coming in to it in case someone, somewhere, associated with that money has problems later!"

Those same 'smart' folks rush to donate money to cops who shoot unarmed people and businesses that brag about discriminating.

Yeah, I think I can give the clintons a pass on this. When the right practices what they preach then maybe I will start to take em serious. 




 Bunch of white folks carrying around guns pretending to be 'brave'.

Hell, you don't even need to carry a gun to be shot by cops in America (well, if you are black). How are these folks just walking around with them? Aren't any cops 'scared'? 





























 Good. 




  Optimism about Libya reached its apogee in July 2012, when democratic elections brought to power a moderate, secular coalition governmenta stark change from Qaddafis four decades of dictatorship. But the country quickly slid downhill. Its first elected prime minister, Mustafa Abu Shagour, lasted less than one month in office. His quick ouster foreshadowed the trouble to come: as of this writing, Libya has had seven prime ministers in less than four years. Islamists came to dominate the first postwar parliament, the General National Congress. Meanwhile, the new government failed to disarm dozens of militias....

Sooo.... What we have is a country with democratic elections, they elected people, and it didn't work out.

Just wait - if we get a conservative in power they will call up Libya and say:

**Hi, I'm a conservative from the American Government, and we're here to help**

*Reagan rolls in his grave* 









 Firefox/Chrome with ad blocker and ghostery. I didn't see any ads or popups so can't really warn someone ahead of time about such things. 




 I lived there off and on since 1996 (not there now), and yeah - I remember it coming up here and there. It always seemed so regressive.

If a majority of vehicles used no gas I could see replacing the gas tax for roads with something like this (but one would also note that most likely cars would weigh less and do less damage).

It all reminds me of a story about a town in Canada. They were using a lot of electric and generating more was going to be a problem. Might have to raise rates to get an expensive new generator and get online, etc. So they pushed people hard to conserve energy, buy more energy efficient appliances, etc. 

They did. So much so that not only did they reduce electric usage by a ton but revenue fell. Which meant less money to maintain the grid/production. So....they raised prices. 

There is a stable point where a system pays for itself. Prices go up to cover the cost of maint. and such, but oddly, it seems wages never seem to match. 




 Let me try to give a broad view on this. I went to school back in the 1970's here (elementary school). We had Christmas plays, songs, decorations, etc in my school. We also had one Jewish kid in my class and learned about Hanukkah and had some decorations for that up.

As kids, it was what we knew in real life and this was just an extension of that. I wasn't in a diverse area at the time (religiously/racially). 

The problem comes in, imho, in that such things can be exclusive and also opens a door to other things. The religious right in this country hates anything that isn't Christian centered. So if schools celebrated holidays of say, Muslims, they would prattle on about terrorism, isis, indoctrination, etc and so on. Not to mention if some students were atheist and don't celebrate any of those holidays in a religious manner.

As done here, it excludes people who aren't Christian. What has been happening is that other groups (satanic temple, muslims, etc) have leveraged the rules to get in on the 'action' and now Christians are starting to feel what others felt all along. They don't want their kids exposed to religious ideals outside of the ones they choose at home.

Personally I think it can be educational to be more diverse in schools - the issue in some cases though is that the leaders of the school are participating with a captive audience. If you have your morning announcements filled with bible verses/prayer (as I experienced) you have people in power subjugating kids to their ideals/beliefs. A public school draws on a diverse population and those who work there shouldn't be pushing their beliefs on kids.

Schools are for educating, not pontificating your personal religious ideals. They have things called Churches for that.  














 Good point. Will have to see if I can find more on this and see if they just blew that off. 




 I am sure some 'bright' person in the assembly there will suggest a tax break. It will go like this "Look, if we let you file taxes once a year and claim a deduction for miles for work, everything will be just fine! Not that it helps you each month when you need it, but you don't really need money now, just that once a year - and if you file a simple form you won't get to claim it...but meh"

 


































 Prediction: Phone companies will start robocalling people offering them to block robocalling for a mere 9.95/mo. 




 Bring it brother, bring it to the floor, while I jump around shouting thank you jeebus!

We are the only nation the lord has blessed (other than Israel; let's open our tax wallets and support them without question, hand them welfare, take it from the poor here for weapons there) with his grace and spirit of freedumb.

We cannot abide the sinners in our midst. The harlots who dress in such a way as to make men sin, the homosexual who perverts what god himself made (well, he didn't make them I guess, or he wouldn't be perfect), the liberals whom spout their nonsense about science/love/kindness/acceptance of others.

Yea, I say verily unto you my good brother, bring it to the floor that we may hear his word evermore.  




 Yeah, but them there dumb liberals don't understand the truth of fundie/isis/etc religion. That's why smart folks vote for amazingly gifted scientists on the right like Ted Cruz, etc. 

You can sit here all day showing them proof in the bible about the first murder and it won't move em a bit. If you want to really upset them - tell em that god is the one who controls the weather and if tornados/floods/etc hit towns (usually because someone somewhere in the US likes gay people and lets them have freedom and life) - they will insist they have 'climate science', 'weathermen', etc who can 'predict' the weather. You can't predict when god will judge sinners (note: divorce, drinking, eating shrimp, etc aren't sins - just being gay is).

Folks like us, we are absolute geniuses compared to them, we know the truth. Git r done!

 2009 - Right Wing Claims Stock Market Declined Because Obama Was Nominated For President

http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2009/03/03/36535/right-wing-market-obama/ 
























 The bible has nothing to do with anything. At all. Ever.

You're an atheist when it comes to everyone else's god and you feel the exact same, I am guessing, about things in other religious books you probably haven't read.

If you don't like the idea of gay marriage, then limit your own life and who you can marry. No one will take that freedom from you - except maybe religious people. 
























 Has that happened with interracial marriages? Or previously married couples? Sounds like more scare mongering. 









 Let's see how the conservatives handle this one :)

"Oh, he was just some lone wolf with mental issues and took too many prescription medications!" Oh wait. NOPE.

Gonna be "See, he represents all of the group! They are all just alike! It's what we have been saying all along."

Gotta love conservatives..... 



















 Conservatives. She sinned by having a baby out of wedlock which means god will send storms on America. Or something like that. 



















 Damn you, you evil socialist, marxist, commie, kenyan born Obama.

Why aren't you doing what the right swore you would back in 2008/2012 - destroy the stock market, seize all guns, ban all wood burning stoves, put people in fema camps, start a caliphate, make unemployment 200%, etc and so on?

I swear, you keep letting down those poor right wingers. No wonder they don't like you. 









 Republican plan: "Pray about it. Jeebus will heal you" which is about the only medical plan they endorse. 




 No, but the conservatives who pimp it surely have. Man...this whole shooting and flag thing has cons coming out of the woodwork to defend the shooter (by seeing him as an 'individual' with mental problems and not as a 'white' or conservative) and the con flag. 

















































 I'm in my 40's, my meat is still good..... 




 "We didn't start the fire, but the blah blah blah blah blah...." 




 How is it fascist? Oh right....the conservatives use that word when someone they don't agree with whips their ass in the US. Gay marriage, gays in the military - and them freedom loving patriots go bonkers because some people got freedoms. 




 Big business can do no wrong in the eyes of the right. This may help amazon's image and profit, so salute them rw'ers - money is the god of the right. 

 




 Yeah, I saw lots of righties falling for this one.

Just like the ole 'Obama is gonna ban wood burning stoves/fireplaces' and the old 'Obama banned the don't tread on me symbol the army was using' and so on.

All lies, but the right never checks. They sure are skeptical of climate change issues though. Funny how their mind works. 










































































 Free Willy!

Oh wait, wrong movie. 






















































 They are a business and can do what they think is best for their business. I fully expect the right will applaud this decision as it is about money - the one true god of the right. 



















 There are quite a few. My understanding is that civil war statues in the south face north, and those in the north face south.

 Naw, just more responsible gun owners. 







































 The dog was a mutt, ran up towards the officer when the door opened. Shot missed (obviously) and the family quickly got the dog under control (this according to local news anchor at 10tv). 




 Go for it, I am sure you know how to post. 




 I know that about (I listen to 700wlw most the day, they talked about it a lot).

Problem is, the cops are our employees and answer to the people. We can't control what civilians do but those that we pay and empower we can exert control on.

We give cops a lot of power. They answer to us. And as their employer I like to keep up on what they are doing (especially since I am a former cop from the 80's and know just how iffy they can be at times). 



























































 Some cons on the net are saying yes - but only if they are Christians.

No surprise there.

http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CONGRESS_TRADE?SITE=AP SECTION=HOME TEMPLATE=DEFAULT

 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional officials say the House will attempt as early as Thursday to revive trade legislation sought by President Barack Obama and blocked last week in a revolt by union-backed Democrats.

The officials say the vote would come on a stand-alone measure that would allow Congress to approve or reject future global trade deals, but not change them.

The Obama administration is seeking the authority as it works to wrap up a deal with 11 Pacific Rim nations.

A provision to renew a program of assistance for workers who lose their jobs because of imports would become part of a separate bill. 
























 Same with the rent. 












































 Is the password "Pencil"? 




 Ah, so, it's about revenge! "I had to do something I didn't like, so now I wanna make others do the same. Cause Freedumb!"

Yeah, sorry, that logic ain't working as a good reason for anything. 




 How did we get by all these years with voting with no pic ID? 

I can't recall ever having to show ID when I voted and I am 49. You're registered, you see your name on the list, sign your name, vote. What do people think is going to happen next? I am going to drive to another polling place, wait in line again, find someone Else's name and forge it?

We have laws against that already. It has been shown to be a rare issue. But now, suddenly, people are freaking out about it and think that we are all crazy law breaking vote fraud loving citizens.

They have in their mind that voter fraud like this is all over the place because people are talking about it. Create an issue that doesn't exist, talk about it a lot, create solution. 




 What's it say about photo id's in the constitution? I mean, I usually hear the right say things like that (re: welfare/etc) when they don't like something.

America has become the land of mistrust. We believe everyone might be a terrorist, so not water bottles on planes, security high at every sporting event (where women can't carry their purses, etc), we have a view of each other that we are all gonna commit vote fraud (hey, there is already a law against that, right?).

How long have we even had photo id's in the US and can't people make fake ones like they do now for bars? The solution is in search of a real problem.

It's high time we got back to seeing each other as fellow Americans and not all criminals laying in wait. But the right loves fear (which is why they are pushing to invade Iran now, etc) and always pushing for less freedoms in the name of 'security'. 




 Lowering taxes on the rich will help the economy.

Iraq has WMD, will only cost 60 billion for a short war. 

I'll shrink the government. Reduce the deficit.

And what happened? Stocks lower than when he took office, no wmd's, over a trillion for the war, recession, housing market collapse, banking/etc near disaster.

Need I say more? And all you got is that we didn't go to war and some minor issues not unlike those we had when we started social security - and it is still better than the no plan the cons had.

Obama isn't perfect by any means, but I'll take Obama over anyone the RW has had to offer or bush. That dude was an embarrassment and a failure of epic proportions. And where are we now? Not spending a trillion on the wars, economy has recovered, stock market higher than ever before.

The right just likes to whine. 




  In Mr. Kerrys case, the senators want to know why he hasnt done more to put pressure on other countries to take back their immigrants when the U.S. wants to deport them. Under that 2001 Supreme Court ruling, known as the Zadvydas case, if other countries wont accept their citizens, the U.S cannot usually detain them for longer than six months. Every year, thousands of immigrants are put back on the streets because of Zadvydas.
 
 Republicans have long pressured the State Department  under both President George W. Bush and now under President Obama  to use diplomatic tools such as denying visas to top officials try to force other countries to take their citizens back.

So....explain how this is the fault of Obama? Congress has to change the rules (and they have tried, but republicans stopped one of their own's bills on just this - and I don't blame them, it was a bad bill by rep King). 









 Ah, you mean the pledge of allegiance republicans made to some man over the pledge they swore to when elected?

Republicans....they really, really, don't care about the country - but kneeling before some guy they are all for.

I will never, in my lifetime, vote for another republican (which I did from 1984-2000). They have turned they backs on this country and it's people. 




 Yet conservatives are all for at will employment states and such. I was always told no company would can someone if they were making them money. Has the right changed their minds on that? 




 Was it Alvin Straight from "The Straight Story?" :) 


































 They aren't even debating what's in the legislation, just spouting off. I don't think anyone listens to anyone there, they know how they are going to vote and just blather on for show. 



















 Just replace them with siri, would be more intelligent than the cons in congress now. 




 I love how hillary trolls conservatives :) They watch every little thing she does, write about it, comment on it, post about it.

She owns em. If they had done that with bush we probably wouldn't have had 9/11, wars, recession, stock market down (first time a ever it was lower than when a prez went into office), housing crash, banking implosion, etc.

Instead, conservatives waved their flags, thumped their bibles, and saluted their boss.

But then...no one ever accused them of being smart or consistent. 




 yeah, it is - but voting to authorize the use of force isn't the same as voting to use force. It was still Bush's call - and he abused his power.

In the end, it's still on him and she can just say she was voting to allow the president to act in the event he needed to.

All in all - bush owns it, no one else. 




 Man...conservatives can be dumb as rocks.

"Hey, I gets my news from deadbart and worldnut daily cause I am super smart! Git r done!"

I really worry about the future of this country when there are folks who vote for republicans and read 'news' from such sites....but then again, they believe in some god that makes no sense. 









 For the MODS in case this station changes it's title too:

http://imgur.com/w3Y1m6F 









 Meh, they changed the title. I will write the station to complain. 




 And he has a lot more karma than you. Seems yours is in the negative territory. Like, trollishy low..... 
























 Cons have investigated this more than 9/11 (and anthrax). They don't honestly care or want answers. 

Remember how they rallied around bush, claimed to attack him was unpatriotic, blame the terrorists, etc?

Yeah...their patriotism is pure BS. 




 What's a shocker? Do tell :) 




 ROFL did OP actually read the article?

Here is what was there (from their link):
But the numbers of employers that say they intend to make the type of capital investments that eliminate jobs through automation doubled, to 59 percent.

So....before the min wage is even hiked business were, as they often do, planning on capital investments in machinery.

Stupid deadbart is predictable, I can't believe anyone is dumb enough to believe them.  


































 Indeed. I am not adding any shortcuts for now (except in my toolbar for politics/news)

I am also noticing firefox crashing about once a day now. Not to mention the god awful memory leaks.

The reason I use it over chrome: photobucket plugin and how turns most all headlines in caps to proper case (saves a lot of time). If chrome did that on the fly I would use it more.

If I come across a solution will let you know. 

































































































































 Udate:

She told the station that race was the main factor as to why she confronted the other woman. Moments before the fight the woman said she heard the other woman in the motorized scooter shouting racial comments to an African-American worker.

Amber told WZPL that she confronted the woman about her use of the derogatory language. The woman on the scooter sprung out of her set and began shoving the other woman.
