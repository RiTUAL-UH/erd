 Another interesting part: Some scientists are upset that the risky expedition caused important resources (supply ships, crew, equipment) to be diverted from other research sites in Antarctica. http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/31/rescue-effort-for-trapped-antarctic-voyage-disrupts-serious-science/?_r=0 
























 Renewables now make up 15.9% of U.S. generation capacity, more than oil and nukes combined. 
































































































































































































































 Seems unbelievable, but the key is the size of the wind farms they modeled. The number of turbines ranged from 78,000 to 540,000. An array that large could slow the winds enough that they wouldn't immediately destroy the turbines themselves. 









































































































































































 Yes -- here's what a 2011 Nature study (linked in article) says: "Contrail cirrus are composed of ice crystals thatsimilarly to natural cirrusreflect solar short-wave radiation and trap outgoing long-wave radiation." Because they're so long-lived, the trapping effect outweighs the reflection effect. 









 NBC poll shows that most Americans--67%--support new EPA carbon emissions standards--will policymakers listen to their constituents as we head into the fall election? 




 Portland sets a great example of how to be a bike-friendly city! 




 The West's wildfires are increasing in size and the fire season is expanding along with the costs of fighting them. The most proactive way to fight fires is to fight climate change. 




 Not good news, especially for Pacific Northwest shellfish aquaculture, and a call for increased proactive coastal management that includes acidification. 




 Unlikely place to test agricultural pesticides, especially when so many of Kauai's species are listed as under the Endangered Species Act.  




 Hopeful news for a binding agreement in Paris. 




 The benefits of walkable cities extends beyond energy efficiency and economics to include community development, which contributes to higher GDP per capita in these cities.  




 Obama's proposal to protect 782,000 square miles not only helps Pacific bluefin tuna, but also becomes a sanctuary for marine species long into the future.

 The media's job is not ostensibly to present both sides of an issue. Doing so leads to "false balance," which has been especially apparent in scientifically settled issues such as anthropogenic climate change. See http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/sciencetoolkit_04 and http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/may/23/john-oliver-best-climate-debate-ever 





























 Agreed -- very cool phenomenon. Here's a link to the video: http://e360.yale.edu/slideshow/blizzard_helps_scientists_visualize_airflow_around_wind_turbines/328/1/ 





































































 Sweden's efforts address a problem that all countries face. At least they are doing something head on to combat the issue of waste streams. Raising awareness about the fate of trash bring attention to the ultimate solution: not recycling, not burning trash for fuel, but rather reducing the amount of trash we produce in the first place.  














 Another troubling impact of climate change on wildlife. 



















 The $2.40 figure comes from an economic study published in the journal of Energy and Buildngs (linked here: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778813007652)
This dollar value was calculated by performing a 50-year life-cycle cost analysis of white roofs versus black roofs. Regardless of cost savings, this article points out that those who are concerned about climate change "should choose white roofs, which are three times more effective than green roofs at cooling the globe." 




 This is an interesting bit of science! It certainly highlights the importance of the field of ecotoxicology and should strengthen concerns over the fate of organic pollutants in the environment. 




 Ocean reserves are extremely important for protecting endangered species and allowing fish populations to recover from over-fishing. This is important work and the vitality of marine ecosystems should not be overlooked.  









 Many ecologists use birds as an indicator species for overall ecosystem health.  If our birds are in trouble, ecosystems likely are as well, and ecosystem approaches (like the wetland restoration programs the article mentions) may lead to more success stories down the road. 




 Historically tropical diseases like Dengue moving to higher latitudes should raise concerns about other epidemiological shifts climate change may bring. 




 Not good news.  As Jarraud went on to say in his statement, "the laws of physics are non-negotiable." 




 The example of solar panels over canals in India is an interesting innovationmaybe sunny, drought-prone regions can learn from it.
