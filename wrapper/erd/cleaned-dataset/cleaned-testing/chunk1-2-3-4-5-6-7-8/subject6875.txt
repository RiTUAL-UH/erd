 I agree about microwave popcorn ripping people off, I just went for a little bit of ease here. Also, even microwave popcorn is fairly inexpensive. 
























 **I Hate Camping**

I get asked a lot, you know. Its weird, you wouldnt think its that common of a question. But I hear it from family, from my co-workers, hell, even from a few of my friends. 

Hey, wanna go camping some time?

I try not to be rude. I say:

No thanks, Im not a big fan of camping. Too many bugs.

I can usually stand the bugs, to be honest. And saying that Im not that big a fan of camping is an understatement, because the thought of camping, spending the night in a tent in the wilderness away from roads and buildings and electricity  well it sounds pretty shitty. I hate camping.

I try not to think about the last time I went camping. But the other day a coworker, Zack, brought it up to me. He said:

Im thinking of planning a big fishing trip weekend after next in Deckers! Calvin and Will said theyd be down. You in?

Umm. Maybe Where would we stay? (Deckers, a small town about a hundred miles into the Rockies, wasnt known for its selection of hotels)

Zack told me: Well, I was assuming wed just camp right beside the river. Bought a brand new tent after our bonuses came in-

No thanks! I interrupted. Im not really much of a camper.

I started to turn away, but Zack put a hand on my shoulder  Hey, whats wrong? Did I say something?

Its nothing, I just dont like to go camping. Too many bugs. I hadnt expected him to push, I was getting a little nervous.

I dont think its the bugs. Zack insisted. He was determined.

Its the bugs, I promise. I offered.

Bullshit. When we had the fire-ant problem in the break room, and you werent phased at all by that shit. Whats your problem with camping?

That was all it took. I broke down. Starting crying. Zack was startled and visibly regretful hed even asked. He started apologizing to me -
Shit man, Im sorry. I didnt think it was a big deal. Listen, if I said something-

Its wasnt you. I spoke, stifling back tears. I just I hate camping.

Zacks a good guy. But, he was curious about what I said, and I cant really blame him. 

Why? What happened? 

I told him what happened. Not then, I was still pretty choked up. We went to a bar that night, after work. We ordered a round of beers, and I told Zack the story of my last camping trip. I told him why I hate camping.

--------------------------

I was 18. It was early August of 06. It must have been 2006 cause thats the year I finished my last year of high school. Just east of the Rockies, its still warm that time of year. I had about 2 weeks left before I left home to go off to college. That was kind of rough, Id lived in the same neighborhood and had the same friends all of my life - I wasnt excited to say good bye to them.

Honestly, it had been a rough summer. I was stressed preparing to go off to school, I was sad to leave my friends behind, and on top of all of that, my high school sweetheart, Sarah, cheated on me sometime near the end of July. We broke up.

That probably doesnt seem relevant, and maybe it isnt, but what is relevant is how it affected me. See, I wasnt really myself that week. I was kind of floating through life, spaced-out. In my own little world. I was spending my dwindling free time wandering the old suburban neighborhood Id grown up in, feeling sorry for myself. Mostly, I wandered alone.

But I had good friends back then, and sometimes they wandered with me. My best friend, his name was August, noticed that I was a broken shell of a human being. He wanted to help. He must of.

I think youre spending too much time here.. August was a short kid, but he was athletic and handsome. He thought he was an expert when it came to girl problems.

What do you mean? 

I mean that youre spending all of your time around all the places that you and Sarah used to go. I can see it getting to you. You should get away for the weekend. 

I grimaced  I cant spare the weekend. I driving up to Silverthorne Saturday night to see my older brother before I leave.

What about just Friday night? We could go camping.

We were driving somewhere, I think, while we were talking. I dont remember where, but that isnt important. The only reason Im sure that we were driving is because I remember swerving a little when he suggested it. I guess I was never much of a camper.

I havent been camping since we were in boy scouts. 

Itd be good for you man! We could get everybody to go. Itd be a good last hurrah, ya know?

So we went camping. Not all of our friends could get permission from their parents to go, but some did. There were seven of us. It was August and I, two girls named Lyndsey and Morgan, a guy named Chris, and a couple  Matt and Dana. We left Friday afternoon. Well, thats not entirely true.

August, Lyndsey, Morgan, Chris, and I left Friday afternoon. Dana had work until 6pm, so she and Matt were going to drive up separately from us that evening. The campground we had chosen was a mountain trail about 50 miles west of where we lived. It wasnt that long a drive, but it was in the mountains, away from civilization, and most of all, you didnt have to pay to get in. The name of the campground was Rampart Range.

I spaced out pretty hard during the drive up. Everyone was going out of their way to cheer me up, but I was having trouble getting my mind completely clear. I read off the directions that wed printed from the Map Quest website so Morgan, who was driving, could get there, but I wasnt really aware of where we were going. I was still in my own little world. Maybe if I was a little more lucid, I would have reconsidered the trip in its entirety.

The five of us got to the trail at about 4pm. There were a bunch of different trails in Rampart Range, so we choose one near the entrance. Morgan parked the car and we climbed out onto dry grass. I groaned and stretched to get rid of the kinks that the drive had put in my neck. I looked around. There was a small trail that ran through some trees, about twenty feet from where we parked.

Shall we? August suggested. He was eager as ever.
We started hiking down the trail to find a place to camp. We hiked for about thirty minutes until the trail led to a small clearing that was deserted. It had a place for a fire pit, probably set up by a Park Ranger, or the owners of the trail. The clearing looked like it got plenty of use  I could see a few empty beer cans and cigarette butts near one edge of the camp. The aesthetic wasnt pleasing, but hey, beggars cant be choosers. We set up camp.

Camp consisted of a small fire and three tents. One tent was smaller, and we had reserved that one for Matt and Dana when they got there. The other two were the same size, so two people (Chris and Morgan, if I recall correctly) slept in one tent, and the rest of us (August, Lyndsey, and I) slept in the other. I dont know how we came to that arrangement, but I remember being mad that I was crammed in a tent with two other people.

I have to admit that the fresh mountain air and the hiking were doing me good. I was on the way to forgetting my worries and I was truly enjoying the time we were spending in the mountains. I remember that we climbed a bunch of huge rocks that we found in the woods near our campsite, and that August, Chris, and I played Hacky-Sack while Morgan and Lyndsey tried to get the fire going. 

At around 7:30, something hit me. I realized that Matt and Dana hadnt shown up yet. It was going to get dark soon. The sky was already that shade of orange it becomes when the sun starts setting. They wouldnt be able to find the trail in the dark.

I tapped the contact for Matt in my phone, trying to call him. Phone reception was pretty spotty in the mountains, and he wasnt picking up. At around 8, I could feel myself growing frustrated. Either Matt was ignoring me or his cellphone wasnt working or wasnt getting service or some shit. I took a break from calling and left my phone in my tent. It was sitting neatly on top of my sleeping bag, where Id be able to get to it easily if Matt called back. 

Chris and August were sitting around the fire roasting hot dogs. I sat down next to them. It was already getting pretty dark  you couldnt see past the trees at the edge of the camp anymore. But the fire was glowing fairly brightly, so I tried not worry about Matt and Dana. Chris and August were talking about high school, and all the kids we had known but would probably never see again. I listened for a while, until Lyndsey interrupted.

Hey, your phone has been buzzing for like, the last 30 minutes. She said, putting my phone in my hand.

Oh shit, thanks for telling me. I replied.

Any time. Lyndsey smiled. 

Eight missed calls from Dana and Matt. *Fuck*, I thought. I called Matt back as soon as I could. The reception was still pretty bad, but he picked up. 

Hello?

Hey Matt! Where are you guys? Its already dark here!

Were fucking lost in this stupid place. Who the fuck chose this campground?

Calm down, describe what you see, Ill help you navigate.

I see trees and rocks and literally nothing else.

Matt, try to be helpful here.

Matt handed the phone to Dana. Her tone was more relaxed than Matts.

Ignore Matt, weve been driving for a couple hours and hes in a bad mood.

Yeah I gathered that.

Which one of the trails did you stop at?

I considered her question for a minute. I had been pretty zoned out when we drove into the campsite, so I wasnt really sure. 

I dont know, but it was near the entrance to Rampart Range, if that helps any.

Uhhh. Weve passed like 20 different trails

Oh shit, right. Well, we took Morgans Dads car. Maybe you guys could look for her car?

What kind of car is it?

Hold on.

I yelled to Morgan. What kind of car did we drive here?

Morgan was in her tent, but she leaned out the flap and yelled Its a Ford Explorer!

I could hear Matt grunting something through the phone. 

Dana you there?

Yeah I am. Dana whispered something quietly to Matt. Matt, chill out Im sure hes just trying to get out of the campground.

Morgans car is a blue Ford Explorer. It should be the 3rd or 4th trail when you enter the campground.

Sounds good. I think we just drove a little too far so  Matt just pull over and let him pass

Her voice was sharp and she sounded irritated. Dana what are you talking about?

Oh, theres this guy tailgating Matt and I in a big white truck. 

Hes been following us for the last 5 miles or so, but Im sure hes just trying to find his way out of the campground.

I could hear Matt in the background of the call. He yelled Hey fucker, back off!

Dana covered the receiver with her hand so I couldnt hear Matt anymore Im going to let you go. If we get lost again Ill give you a call.

She hung up. Honestly I was relieved, you could hear how stressed she was in her tone. Everyone at our campsite was starting to get tired. Chris and Morgan wandered off to their tent to get some shut eye. That was what they told us anyway. The rumor was that they had been hooking up all summer, and this was just another opportunity to spend some alone time together. Anyway, that left August, Lyndsey and I sitting around the fire, killing time until Matt and Dana showed up. 

Around 10pm we started getting worried. It had already been a long day and camping has a way of taking it out of you. My ass was sore from sitting on the hard ground beside the fire pit. I wanted desperately to go to sleep, but I was determined to wait for Matt and Dana. I was considering calling Matt again while August and Lyndsey were talking about a mutual friend of ours named Peter, and how he had decided to go to Europe for a year instead of going to college.

Matt, it was fine. I bet he was just lost.

It sounded like Danas voice. It was coming from the trail, which was out of view behind a few trees. I stood up and walked towards the trail. Matt and Dana looked like they had been walking for the last hour or so. They were covered in dirt and pine needles. Their eyes were bloodshot and strained. There were bags underneath their eyes, and Matt walked with a slight limp. They looked exhausted. You could tell from Danas tone that they were growing tired of one another.

No Dana, that was creepy as fuck. Matt snapped.

Hey, whats going on guys? I asked.

Matts voice broke when he spoke. He didnt just sound angry he sounded scared. 
Some guy in a white truck followed us while we were driving through this stupid fucking campground.

Im sure he was just trying to find his way out of the campground. I suggested.

Yeah thats what I thought too. But then we found Morgans car. I parked beside it. I thought that when I turned the car to park, the guy who was following us would keep on driving down the road. But he didnt.

Dana was quiet. What do you mean? I asked.

Matt hesitated. When I got out of the car, the guy in the white truck just stayed there. He just sat there. Watching us.

Matt, Dana and I stood at the edge of the trail, silently. You could feel the tension in the air.

Was he there when you left the car? 

Matt nodded silently. Dana had started to cry, and Matt was pale and shaken. Ill admit that I was shivering a little myself. Lyndsey and August exchanged a quick glance.

Maybe we should just go? Lyndsey stammered. The story had clearly spooked her as well.

Yes! Lets get the fuck out of here. Matt interjected.

No! Look guys were already here. Its already dark. August argued. Lets just go to bed, and well leave in the morning okay?

Scared as we all were, August was right. It was dark, and it would take half an hour to get back to the car, never mind the drive home. We went to bed. August and I slept in one tent, with Lyndsey in between us. We were teenagers, so we felt like we needed the buffer to preserve our masculinity, I guess. Dana and Matt slept in the other tent. Our tent was in between the other two, and my sleeping bag was on the side of the tent closest to Matt and Danas tent.

It was so dark out that you couldnt see your hand two feet in front of your face. We all tried to go to sleep. I was pretty freaked out from Matts story. I couldnt sleep. I laid in my sleeping bag listening to August and Lyndsey snore loudly. The whole time, I just kept thinking about the person in the white truck who had creeped Matt and Dana out. Probably just some drunk fucker looking to mess with a couple of teenagers I thought. The wind was howling outside, making the grass outside whistle.

Around 2 in the morning, I was just starting to drift into sleep when I hear a noise by my head. 

Lyndsey, shh, Im trying to sleep. I whispered. The noise didnt sound like Lyndsey talking. It sounded like a twig snapping. It sounded like someone had someone had stepped on a stick.

I sat up. I heard the noise again. This time it was the sound of a footstep on the matted grass below it. The wet sound of the foot lifting slowly in the grass. It was coming from right beside me. It was coming from just outside my tent. Then, I heard a second noise. It sounded like something heavy was being drug through the grass. I wasnt sure what it was until I heard a metallic CLUNK as the heavy object was dragged over a rock in the grass.

*I must be imagining this*, I thought. *The noise is all in my head.*

The footsteps were getting closer and closer to the entrance to our tent. I could hear that dragging sound the whole time. I thought I was dreaming. 

Then I heard Matts voice from the other tent. Does anyone else hear that?

I felt all of my breath leave my lungs. I hear it Matt.

I was overcome by absolute terror. I think Matt was too, because he didnt say a word. All I could do was wake August and Lyndsey.

What is it-August started

 Shh. Do you hear that? I whispered.

Everyone was silent. There was no sound outside, except for the wind and the brushing of the grass against the tent. Then I heard the faintest noise. I couldnt tell what it was at first, it sounded like metal.

Then I realized. It was the zipper of my tent. It was slowly being pulled open from the outside. 

What the fuck!? August yelled. The second he yelled, the noise stopped and whoever (or WHATEVER) was unzipping our tent, started running. You could hear its heavy footsteps sprint through the campsite.

Overcome with stupidity or courage, or maybe a little of both, August tore our tent open. He ran outside to see if he could see what was fucking with us.

I dont see anything guys.

By this point, all seven of us were out of the tents. I was shaking. Matt and Dana had both been through so much, they were trembling violently.

Should we leave? Chris quivered. I think he was annoyed that his time alone with Morgan had been interrupted, but he was scared as well.

Its 3 in the goddamn morning. Its too dark to leave. I mumbled.

There were murmurs of reluctant agreement from my friends. It was too dark and early to try to leave now. No one was ballsy enough to walk back to the car in the absolute darkness that was the night. We decided that we would try to get some rest, and leave the second it was light enough out to see.

I dont think Ive ever slept worse. I was so horrified that every time the wind blew or the grass rubbed against a tent, I almost yelped. But we made it through the night. When it started to get light out, around 7 or 8 in the morning, we warily climbed out of our sleeping bags, packed up the campsite and left. I don't think any of us were really sure what had happened to us. Chris had suggested that it was a deer or something equally as harmless. No one else could dismiss our absolute terror that easily. The footsteps were too heavy to be a deer. The way it walked was so deliberate, like whatever we heard was trying not to be heard. I still have nightmares about the sound of our tents zipper slowly opening. 

--------------------------

Fuck man. Id probably hate camping too, if that happened to me. Zack lamented over his third or fourth beer.

Yeah. It was a rough night. I sighed.

Zack yawned. It was late. I had been talking for a long time. Zack chuckled and put two tens down on bar counter.

Well, god knows Im not getting any sleep tonight, after a story like that.

Yeah. Now you know how I feel.

You need a ride back? He asked.

Nah. Ill walk. The bar was only a few minutes from my apartment.

Suit yourself. Zack said, standing up and cracking his back. See you at work tomorrow?

Yeah man. See you.

As I walked home I thought about that night in Rampart Range. That night was the most terrifying night of my entire life. Zack probably thought it was a pretty good ghost story. I bet he would tell it on his fishing trip with Calvin and Will. 

But I didnt tell Zack the worst part. I wasnt sure he could have taken it.

After we left the campground, we all went home to get some sleep. After a few hours of much needed rest, Matt went in to the office where his mom worked. Shes an attorney, or something.
He was waiting for his mom to finish a meeting. While he waited, he chatted with his moms secretary, Denise.

You look tired. Rough night? She joked.

Yeah. I went camping. It was kind of crappy.

Whys that?

I dont know. I guess we just choose a sketchy place to camp is all.

Denise frowned. Where was that?

Some campground called Rampart Range, or something like that.

Denise started crying, almost immediately. Matt was startled. He told me she cried for almost thirty minutes before she was calm enough to talk again.

When Matt told me this part of the story, I asked him why she had gotten so upset. Matt went pale. He looked like he was going to cry.

Denise said her son went camping in Rampart Range a few months ago. He and his friends were attacked by someone at their campground. Their attacker ripped open their tent in the middle of the night. Her sons friends were found a day later by a park ranger, beaten within an inch of their life. Their attacker had used a heavy metal hammer on them. But they got off lucky. Denises sons body was found dismembered and strewn violently throughout the campsite. They never found the guy who did it.

I hate camping.

I Hate Camping - test_subject6875 
























 Hopefully this is the right place. With the announcement of fallout 4, I realized I want to be able to play newly released games again. My last actual console was the Xbox 360, and I've been squeezing by with a decent laptop for games for the last 3 or 4 years. I can run games like l4d2, but not games like dead rising 3.

To play games like fallout 4 and dead rising 3,  would it be cheaper to build a gaming PC or get a used Xbox one?
What price ranges should I expect?

 Get a used Xbox one?
