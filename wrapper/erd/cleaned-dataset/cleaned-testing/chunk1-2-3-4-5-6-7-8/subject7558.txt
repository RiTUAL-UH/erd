 I have always gotten auditory hallucinations when I'm falling asleep, whether I'm sober, on kratom or on dope. Sometimes they startle me lol. But that's how I know I'm finally falling asleep. 




 I think you meant to reply to the comment above me. But yeah, I agree. HS is the shit. 




 Where do you go? 




 TIL Valium grows in the ground. 




 I went to the optometrist after a 4 day crank bender one time. He says to me, he says "Holy cow! Your pupils are huge! I don't even need to use the dilation solution!". So I says to him, I says "Yeah, I forgot to take my Klonopin this morning!". And so he says to me, he says "Oh. OK." Afterward I went out to my Jeep and my buddy (who was waiting in the car) has my hood popped and all my doors open, scouring the whip with a washcloth. I says to him, I says "God damn Robby, you hit the shit again, didn't ya?" And he says to me, he says "Yup. You were taking forever". 

I was only in there for like 20 minutes. That brother got issues. 




 I had the same problem for a long time. Now I chase every burn with a half a glass of ginger ale and I don't have the problem anymore. 




 HS for sure. I go 2:1 RVS to Bali. I buy 50 bucks worth total (shipped) and it lasts me around 10-14 days. Obviously I still have 50% of the Bali left after the RVS is gone, so then I go $25 on just the RVS to get me through the next 10-14 days. 




 It's... somethin special. Got me ready to take on the day today, boy. 




 But if I had to choose 1, it'd be Bali. Red Vein Sumatran doesn't do too much for me by itself. 




 I actually combine RVS and Bali 2:1 for every dose. It's the fucking best, ever. 




 BALLLIIIIIIIII 




 This was a wonderful post.  




 Coffee gives me anxiety, but the last 3 times I drank it, the reaction I got was so bad that there's nothing worth going through that again. Coffee can go fuck itself. I was having like tremors, couldn't even hold my head and eyes straight ahead without my head shaking, hands felt detached, and I just felt like shit. It almost felt like dehydration or something but I POUND water all DAY my nigger so IDK, 




 Wait.... there's kratom on Amazon?
And There's such a thing as a Canadian Amazon? 
 




 Yeah I almost panicked a little when all that happened. I'm comfortable with them and the strains I get from them. Would not like to have to shop around. 




 Fuck yeah 




 I always go Herbal Salvation 




 If you're a hardcore kratom aficionado, you manned that shit down and you liked it. 




 Once I got like 95 Dilaudid 4's and I shot them all with my girlfriend over the course of like 60 hours. I didn't shit for maybe two days, and i didn't think anything of it because I was always doing meth and not shitting a whole lot anyways. Well, on the third day, I suddenly had to shit. It didn't feel crazy or anything, just the normal bowel movement feelings. I went and got on the toilet and I pushed and it felt like the fat end of a bowling pin was trying to squeeze out my asshole. I pushed and pushed and it got just to the point where I couldn't just pull my pants up and get laxative and wait, cuz it was too far out, but at the same time it was still not coming out at all. I tried picking at it, but the way it was shaped it just didn't do any good. After 67 minutes of straight pushing on the toilet, sweatin my balls off, it finally came out. I have never experienced such a relief as I did that day, in that moment. I was so happy, the whole time I was pushing all I could think about were all the times I wasn't constipated that I took for granted. It was really a glorious one. It was shaped like a football and it was easily the widest I've ever had. I almost wanted to weigh it. But yeah so I know what you mean by bein so desperate you want to pick at it. 
 




 Bagel with cream cheese for breakfast, random meals with meat for lunch and usually either ham or turkey sandwiches on rye bread for dinner. Some bowls of granola cereal thrown in here and there. I drink probably 3 liters of water a day. No coffee. Do drink juice. Just copped magnesium citrate and stool softener. 




 Shut the fuck up 




 I got some. Thanks. 




 It would but it gives me wicked anxiety so I don't drink it. Sucks cuz I love it. 




 Well. I can eat Bali all day and not get bound up at all. But as soon as the Sumatran comes into play, I'm bound up. So I'm not thinkin it's so much the plant matter as it is just the effects of a certain strain... For me, anyways. 




 I bought some magnesium citrate caps and some stool softener without the stimulant laxative. I'm gonna use both the magnesium and the stool softener for now and see if I can clean myself out a little and then I'll see if just the magnesium does the trick. Thanks for the input. 




 I take Green Bali and Red Vein Sumatran twice a day, about 6-8 grams total. The Bali doesn't block me up, but the Sumatran does. Most of the time I manage to squeeze one or two small bowel movements a day, but it's common for me to go a few days without having one. It always comes around the third day, but this is obviously not a comfortable schedule. What does everybody recommend to take in order to regulate my bowl movements? I have no plans of dropping the kratom as a whole, or the Red Vein Sumatran, for that matter. 




 P.S.  your user name is awesome 




 This thread is retarded. This is the type of shit you don't want lawmakers to see. 




 What strain(s) do you use? 




 I go 2-3 grams of Red Vein Sumatran to 1-1.5 grams of Green Bali chased with a little ginger ale to (successfully) counteract nausea. I do it at 7 am and then again around 5-6 pm. I think your best way of cutting back would be to stop cold turkey for a few days and then continue at a lower dose, because lowering your dose without clearing your system out might lead to disappointing effect.

I love kratom. It's the shit. 




 Just toss it in a little bit of applesauce and then you can swallow it whole. That's what I used to do with shrooms. But I would try to keep the amount of applesauce as minimal as possible. 




 I would just take some on the flight but I would also send some through the mail to your destination in case they take it on the flight. 




 I feel like you maybe ought to tackle one thing at a time. That's what counselors suggest and I can see why they do... like maybe start taking kratom first in lieu of alcohol, since I'm pretty sure that's probably your biggest problem. After a few months of stability, then you should try substitution for the caffeine and nicotine. 

That's just my opinion. I understand why they tell you to do it that way... quitting alcohol, cigs and caffeine all at once seems like it could possibly be disastrous before long. Then again, kratom does some wonderful things. Just my 2 cents. 




 I smoked weed for a few years and then got hooked on opiates. I did them both together for a long time, but then whenever I would smoke weed without being high on opiates, I would get absolutely horrible anxiety. I just ended up quitting weed completely, because it doesn't appeal to me any more... but that sounds kinda the same as you're experiencing. 




 WHO IS THIS FUCKIN GUY 




 Maeng Da makes me feel like I'm gonna die. I go two parts Red Vein Sumatran to one part Green Bali.. about 3-4 grams. It's super excellent. 




 Have some ginger ale on hand in case of nausea. 




 Yeah usually I don't bother responding to articles like that but it put me over the edge when he recommended a benzo. I also just couldn't believe all the comments absolutely bashing kratom. People abuse it in order to get high and then are somehow surprised it becomes a problem for them. I don't use it because I want to get high, I use it because I want to stay sober.

Congratulations on your clean time. 




 I chase every burn with a few gulps of ginger ale. I thought it was stupid when I first heard about it, but I tried it the first time and my nausea instantly was gone. Haven't gotten nauseous since. 




 Eastern US time. New to PS4 and BF4. 

PSN: crfw

Do have mic. 




 fuck yeah 




 I get it from Herbal Salvation. I get the Green Bali and the Red Vein Sumatran. I take it 2 parts RVS to 1 part Green Bali. I always dose the exact same amount and my tolerance hasn't changed.... but I've also learned to appreciate the subtle effects, I don't go into it looking to get blasted... although my morning one is always stupendous. 




 me too. 

psn: crfw

just got it and i don't even know anybody who owns a ps4 lol. i only play bf4. 




 There's so many nightmare-ish comments about kratom on that page that it's hard to believe they aren't loaded comments.  




 Pffffft. Swishing krat around my mouth is half the fun. It just wouldn't be the same if I went with caps. 




 Whoops. My apologies. 




 I've never even heard of this. 2 micrograms seems like a very small amount, since there's 2 milligrams in an 8 mg suboxone strip and that's hardly even really active at an oral dose. Wouldn't taking any amount of nalaxone with opiates just offset the opiate's affinity for the opiate receptors , so taking a small dose of nalaxone would be like taking a little less oxycodone than you actually ingested? Are you supposed to still feel the effects of the oxycodone when you make this combo, and still have your tolerance lowered at the same time? Confusing stuff. 




 Never mind. I'm sure it is. 




 Is it legal for me to sell it to somebody? 




 You scare me by taking 12-14g of Bali. 




 Bali and Maeng Da are really at opposite ends of the effects spectrum. If you liked the Bali then you should be looking into the more sedating strains. I personally combine Bali and Red Vein Sumatran, but I have 100 G's of Maeng Da just sitting here because I tried it and I hated it. Makes me all jittery and fuckin like twitchy and light headed and fucks with my muscles. Not fun. 




 So I got up today and dropped about 4.5 g of the green bali... 3 hours later I was at lunch with my family and the nausea was still bad enough that I didn't even wanna eat. I remembered you mentioned ginger ale, so I ordered some and bam.. gone instantly. I went to the store and copped some 2 liters and came back here for the second dose of the day with a ginger ale chaser and it's all fuckin good. Thanks a lot man (or woman). 




 I don't need to justify it. I shot heroin for 8 years and now I only do kratom. I think that says it all. 




 K, I literally just went and ordered 100 g's of Red Vein Sumatran from HS. Hopefully that solves the problem for me. Thanks. 




 The strain I use is actually Green Bali, it's the only one I've tried that I like... although the one I'm trying next is red vein Sumatran. I was told it's similar to Bali. 




 Tossing and washing literally does not even bother me. I could toss a spoon-full in my mouth dry and chew on it and throw some water in and swish it around and chew some more and just swallow it and it wouldn't even faze me. I'm 100% positive the nausea isn't from the tossing and washing. It may be from the powder itself in my stomach, maybe I need to use a tea, but if that's the case the capsules won't help anyway.  




 Really? You take it on a full stomach to prevent nausea? It works? 




 Sometimes I get nausea on a dose i barely even feel. 




 Alright, I'll give it a go. Thanks a lot. 




 Where from? I have anxiety too and I can't deal with anything speedy. 




 A vicious liquid? Is that like sulfuric acid or something? That stuff seems pretty vicious. 




 Do you mean the green bali from HS does that to you or all green bali does that to you? 




 Honestly, if I wasn't a recovering opiate addict, I'm not even sure I would notice the effects of kratom. They can be so subtle sometimes and I think people often think it's going to hit them like a ton of bricks.  




 THAT BROTHER WRECKED 




 I've been going with MmmS but i recently put in an order to HS after seeing all the glowing reports concerning HS on here. The estimated delivery was supposed to be today, but it hasn't even made it out of Idaho yet. WTF! Again, it's USPS's fault, not HS... it just sucks cuz I'm really looking forward to it lol. Hopefully it gets straightened out before I run out of my current supply. 




 I'LL BE BACK ON THE DIRTY D IN NO TIME 
























 I threw up on myself a couple years ago, the third time i ever tossed and washed. It was the last dose I owned and I was pissed. Ever since then I'm just more careful about it, and hasn't happened since.
 




 That's incredibly inaccurate. I prefer HS over Mmm, Speciosa all day. The quality IMO is better and it's way cheaper. 




 Cost isn't a huge factor? OH SHIT THIS NIGGA BALLIN 




 iOSPoundcake? 




 Wayward apostrophe's 




 Anal parachute 




 Well, you can OD on anything, technically. But you would have to eat a pretty god damn ridiculous amount of kratom to die from it. So accidental  overdoses aren't especially harmful with kratom, you can just throw up or lie down until it goes away. 




 You're a dirty nigger 




 What kratomkorner coupons? I don't know of any. 




 He's confusing shills with people who love their products, prices and service. I recommend them all the time. They just have a large following. I'm quite interested to see some concrete shillage though, if there is any. 




 I'll bet you a package of Monistat 7 that it's extremely relevant. 




 The other day I was feeling adventurous, so I decided to try a 3-way strain mixture. I went 2 grams of Red Vein Sumatran, 2 grams of Green Bali, and 2 grams of Red Vein Thai. About 45 minutes later, I was feeling pretty great, when I suddenly felt the need to shit. I went and got on the toilet and squeezed a good one out. However, I was still feeling quite adventurous, so I decided to wipe from back to front. I've always wiped from front to back, and I was just curious what it would be like to not have to lean off the seat to wipe... I could just reach down between my legs. Unfortunately, because of this, I ended up with a yeast infection on my nutsack. Do not recommend. 




 Phenibut and benzos don't have a cross-tolerance? Could that be why? IDK anything about phenibut. I used to be prescribed k-pins as well, i'd get 90 1 mg pills and i would blast through them in 5 days, which i never remembered. It's a horrible drug to be addicted to, and a dangerous one to get off of. 




 Does your tolerance not build when you take DXM? Can I get away with taking a really small dose of DXM? I really don't like the idea of using it every day though. 




 Looks like I better try this tomorrow. I can't seem to talk myself into a washout, unfortunately. 




 Try a different strain. Maeng Da makes me feel like shit. 




 I used to shoot heroin. The first time I ever took kratom, I took 7 grams. I don't know which strain, I didn't know enough about kratom at the time to care. I went from being dope sick to feeling ok in about 20 minutes, it was really quite noticeable. 

I didn't catch a buzz off it at all, I just felt normal again. That was the problem. I didn't want to just be ok, I wanted to be high. I took kratom a few more times at pretty high doses, and then just went back to the opiates.

It wasn't until I went back to prison this last time and got out, that I decided to give kratom a go again. This time it worked great, because I was at baseline as far as my tolerance was concerned. It filled the void I had in me. Even though I'd been sober for about 8 months (I'd used Suboxone in prison in the beginning of my bid) , I still just felt empty. So I gave it a shot and I haven't looked back since. It's been about 8 months. 

The problem is, when he's hooked like that, the mental aspect is half the battle. And having a plant that just keeps him feeling OK is just going to cover the physical side of things, it won't do much for the mental cravings. I would say his best bet would be to (somehow) get off the opiates for about a month and then start a kratom regimen... that way it does something for him both mentally and physically. Other than that, he could start a kratom regimen now and seek outpatient treatment and/or NA/AA for the mental side of things. I don't know. I hope this helps. 




 Call the ambulance right before you take it so they're there when you start to lose your shit. 




 That sounds detrimental to your health. Not the sort of thing you want to deal with long term, who knows what the effects could be. What about veins? Does it happen with red, green and white veins? 




 I can't make heads or tails of this comment. 




 Tomorrow, around noon. 




 Just slip a few grams into her soup and then she'll see the light. 




 Did you pay several hundo for it? Maybe it's heroin. Maybe those are heroin rocks. 




 You do this every day? I need to find a solid method myself. 




 I giggled at your comment. 




 The only green I touch is Bali, mixed with reds, and I haven't been getting any palpitations... so yeah, might be worth experimenting. I also have a history of heart palpitations and anxiety anyway, so I suppose the whites might exacerbate it. 




 What strain are you using? White veins and Maeng Da both give me heart palpitations, along with a plethora of other side effects. I've sworn them off. 




 4) Green stains are hell. Grass stains were always the bane of Mama's existence. 




 Be careful. 




 Tobacco: You may crave tobacco more when using kratom. I chew tobacco and I feel nothing extra after I chew, other than I'm always ready for another chaw as soon as I spit my last one out. Food: Always take kratom on an empty stomach, being full can minimize the effects greatly. Some claim eating a small meal 45 minutes after kratom ingestion can actually potentiate it. I've never witnessed it. Soda: Some also say caffeine increases kratom efficacy. Once again, I've never noticed it. 




 MAKE ME, DICK FACE 




 That brother can keep his ass over here. 




 100 mg oral morphine? Forget about it. Kratom is for people who want to maintain, not for people looking to get high. You'll never achieve that sort of feeling from kratom. Come back and give it a try when you're all strung out and out of options. Until then it's going to be pretty useless to you. Even if you take a heroic dose, the side effects will have you fucked up long before any sort of opioid feeling will. 




 It's really not even comparable to cannabis. If you're opioid naive, you can certainly get a high from it in the beginning. I've never smoked it but I've read reports that it's hardly even worth doing. I'd imagine you'd have to smoke a couple grams of it at once to achieve desired effect, although I'm not familiar with it at all. 




 It's apples and oranges. Kratom is the type of thing that might tempt you to indulge in it more often than you originally planned. I wouldn't recommend it if you're just trying to make your weed go longer. 




 I'll review as well. 




 Junk-Gnomes are sneaking in your room and shooting you with H right after you fall asleep. 




 That's who I think about while I fuck the sandwich. 




 I just saw your name and your comment and I immediately imagined what it'd be like to stick my dick in a vacuum cleaner hose that has a club sandwich jammed in the tip. 




 I have an Amazon gift card, was thinking of coppin some kratom myself but would be pissed if I wasn't happy with it. Best to not chance it I guess. 




 I'll notice he's gone. I'll notice how fuckin peaceful it is without his negativity. lol 




 Your mom choked to death on my wiener 




 I hate the taste of tea. 




 Sources: 
Herbal Salvation: Great value, my personal vendor****
MMM, Speciosa: Known to have highest quality, but you pay for it.******
Strains: Red Veins (Sumatran, Borneo, Thai, etc.) are best for sedation but I throw a little Green Bali in there to spice it up a notch. It seems to really potentiate the Red Veins, and it's not too speedy. Such combos are great for pain.  




 Good question. He's a dirty shill. 




 Ha. In reality, he's actually a boner consumer. 




 Awwww. Poor thing. 




 Only 77 dollars for 2 ounces. What a steal. 




 You guys could have at least posted a couple other times before dropping your shill post. This is just blatantly obvious and disrespectful to this sub and its subscribers. 




 Cop a sample pack and try them all, see which ones (or combinations) you like best and go from there. Use ginger if you get nausea. Use as little as possible. Get plain leaf, no extracts. Go several days cold turkey from your pain meds before you try kratom and the results will be much better than if you try to transition from one directly to another.  




 This is downright snazzy. Bravo. 




 A couple... When I pooped, my poop already had toilet paper in it. Also, I now own 5 less grams of kratom. 




 It really itched. Do not recommend.

 




 DAMN. THAT BROTHER ASTUTE. 




 Can you deliver to New York? I'll give you a handy-j. 




 Withdrawal from any sort of opioid gives me nightmares, if I can even manage to sleep. 




 WHERE'D IT GO? 




 YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 




 Robbed?

You nod from UEI? 




 Reminds me of people that think ecstasy is cut with heroin or coke. It just doesn't make any sense. Kratom vendors are going to synthesize methadone so they can lace their kratom with it? Sounds crazy.  Surely they wouldn't be using pharmaceutical methadone. That would be even crazier. They wouldn't be able to afford it. I would know for sure if there was methadone in my kratom, lol. I'd be ripped all day, rather than feeling good for a couple hours and then just feeling a glow the rest of the day. Tell ya what though... if somebody finds kratom with methadone in it, I want some. 




 Just jam a ball into your vein. Then you don't have to worry about coming down... ever. 




 Go for it. I chase every dose with ginger ale. If I don't, I get nausea. Ginger ale works really well though. I wouldn't be using kratom without it. I suggest you get some. 




 One time I wiped my ass from back to front and I got a yeast infection on my nutsack. 




 Even when it isn't the holidays, USPS screws up once in a while and loses a package in circulation anywhere from 1 to 10 days. It just happens. It's much more likely during the holidays. I'm sure it'll make it, but give it a week or two. If it never arrives, I imagine MS would replace it.  




 The only thing I understand in this post is MS. 




 I go 2:1 RVS to Green Bali. The RVS does hardly anything by itself, no matter how much I take. But that 1/3rd of Bali REALLY potentiates the RVS. It's the only way I roll. 
























 I don't care for your books.
 




 That combination has been known to cause uncontrollable cravings for wieners in the people who take it. 




 Well it would be one thing if it was a fresh leaf, but to put dry leaf in your mouth? Fuck that. 




 Brother.. you ain't gettin the tingle in your sacknuts? 




 Call their post office. If they aren't willing to hold it for you, UPS or FedEx will for sure.  




 Load a turkey baster up with hot butter. Get naked. Lay in fetal position. Insert turkey baster into bunghole. Have friend jump on bulb of turkey baster. Keep your mouth closed when he jumps on it so it doesn't fly out your throat. You're welcome. 




 Just mail it to your destination. 




 Well... As much as I love a good back and forth with a mentally retarded person, I'm gonna have to cut this one short. I hope you figure out your complex problem without giving yourself an aneurysm. Take care. I love you. 




 Well, you implied the guy was retarded, like he didn't understand that dipping a wet spoon into a bag of kratom was bad. All I was doing was pointing out that he probably didn't fucking mean to do it that way. If you weren't such an asshole about his advice, I wouldn't have said what I did. See how that works, pumpkin? 




 Kratom. It'll give you a tingly feeling in your ballsack.....
...Kratom. Toilet paper now lasts 3 weeks.....Kratom. You won't want to beat your girlfriend as much.....Kratom. Shitting like a rabbit is great...... Kratom. Gagging never felt so good. Unless you're gay. ......Kratom. Boners were never really that important anyway. ....Kratom. Crying when the mail's late is normal, right? .....Kratom. So good even your eyeballs will be staggering. .....Kratom. No more wet shits, rim jobs are now game all day long. ......Kratom. No, you dumb slamhog, I don't want to go get something to eat yet. We need to get the fuck home so I can dose before I smack the living fuck out of you. (See number 3) 




 Amps just give me motivation to jack off for like 9 hours.  




 I use their measuring spoon, I just dump it out into a regular spoon each time and then put it in my mouth. It sort of surprises me that you wouldn't be able to figure out a way around dumping the wet measuring spoon back into the bag. 




 Fuck those dirty fuckin cocksuckers. It's shit like that that gives kratom a bad fucking name. Foxykotton. Anybody who buys that shit is directly contributing to kratom's downfall. 




 I would be out in about 3 hours, Kramer style 




 Yes... go there and search "speciosa" in the search bar. You have to do it that way every time if you want to see their kratom. Sorry, I should have mentioned that. 




 I hate to beat a dead horse shill style, but I take RVS every day, and I get it from Herbal Salvation. It's 25 bucks plus 5 for shipping for 105 grams, and it's great. Those numbers you're reading aren't really much to rely on... just get it, start at 2 grams, and go from there. 




 That's exactly the type of program Mac is referring to. It's ridiculous. The one I had to go to recently was $95 for an hour and a half session. There's like 12 people and one counselor. That's almost 1200 dollars they make just for us to sit in a circle and shoot the shit. It's a fuckin joke. I've done plenty of those outpatient programs, and I must say, if you really want help, go to AA or NA. It's free and it's sure as hell a lot more helpful than outpatient programs... unless, of course, you're mandated to go to outpatient, like I was... then we don't have a choice. 




 They're bullshitting you. It's a tactic they use to try to get you to admit you've done something. If your piss test comes back clean, there's no way for them to tell you've ever taken any opioids at any point in your life, period. 




 If it bothers you so much, you could just stop coming here. IDK if you thought about that. I think you might have some sort of mental retardation. 




 If you're getting high on oxy every day, your tolerance will build up to 100 mg in no time. That's a pretty average dose for a regular user. 




 Isn't it supposed to have a money back guarantee? 




 Wtf are you talkin about man. #1: He needs to drop two on an empty stomach and go from there. If he drops three with food in his stomach,  he'll likely not even fuckin feel it. #2: He also needs to wait longer than fuckin 20 minutes before dosing more, you crazy asshole. More like an hour. You might start to feel the effects after 10-20 minutes but they're nowhere near done hitting you at that point. I don't feel the full effects until about 40-50 minutes after dropping it on an empty stomach. #3: It's blatantly fucking obvious that both of those are plain leaf. Anybody who's done even rudimentary research on kratom knows exactly what those fuckin strains are, and they sure as hell know the vendor they came from, seeings how it's the most fucking popular one on reddit... if not the most popular period.  #4: WHO THE FUCK PAYS A DOLLAR FOR A GRAM OF PLAIN LEAF?!?!?!?! Take your shitty ass advice over to r/KratomKorner and keep it over there, dickface. 




 Poppy seed Tizzea. 




 Phew. Thanks for lettin me know man. Appreciate it. 




 Oh shit. I don't have enough posts to message anybody or comment on XDA so I didn't say anything over there, but I didn't realize you were the guy lol. Thanks man. Greatly appreciated. I sent Huawei an email 2 days ago for the unlock code. Haven't heard back yet. 




 Just get the Paypal debit card and use that on sites that accept Mastercard. 




 I wish it was a little more in-depth. 




 Well. Percocet, like anything with "ocet" in the name, has acetominophen in it... I know what you're talking about though. Roxies. Instant release oxycodone. Yeah 30 mg a day isn't much of a hook. NAMSAYIN. 




 This brother righteous. 




 I was just about to say that lol. 




 It makes an unbelievable difference... 30 mg of fentanyl would kill somebody, whereas 30 mg of codeine probably wouldn't even be felt. 




 Kratom used to cause me terrible sinus issues. They've pretty much gone away since I quit snorting it though. 




 30 mg of what opiate? Would need to know. 




 You just gotta get good at spreading the ballskin taut, and then itching it. I love it. Feels like Jesus is touching my nutsack. 




 Ginger root 




 Roger that. Can't blame you there... but if you run into any nausea issues, cop yourself some ginger candy or ginger ale. I chase every ingestion with a couple swigs of ginger ale. 




 Yeah my drugs of choice in order were opiates, meth, benzos and addies. That shit's all behind me now though, thanks to the big K. And yeah man it's only 6 bucks for 4 10 gram samples. No Maha Kali though. I tried asking for it, not realizing they don't give that one out in samples, and I ended up receiving a white vein lol. I was pissed. I just can't bring myself to pay 35 bucks for 100 grams. It won't be long before I cop a kilo of the Red Vein Sumatran from Bikhuk, seeings how it's half the price of HS. Unfortunately they don't have Bali, I'd probably just keep getting that from HS. 




 BLUCKA BLUCKA SUP NUGGAH That would make sense, because the Bali I received gave me more side effects than anything. I'm sure I could have talked to Ken about it but it wasn't even worth the aggravation to me. I use Bali every day, I would have to get it from somewhere else regardless. I did receive a sample of White Vein Indo from them, and that was the first and last white vein I ever tried. Nothing against them, I'm just not into the whites. Gives me wicked anxiety. Funny that I shot meth for 7 years but if I try to smoke weed or consume white vein kratom, I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack. lol. 




 I ordered from MS twice, got Bali both times and I honestly didn't even think it was good, don't even understand what people are raving about. I went to HS and got way better Bali for a hell of a lot cheaper than MS, and I haven't looked back since. 




 If you just ate, don't even bother trying to take any more for a couple hours... it works best if you're hungry when you take it, I usually wait til I feel the first hunger pang come on. Having any food in your stomach greatly diminishes the effects... But you probably just didn't take enough. Take 3 g of that RVT and mix it with 2 g of that Green Malaysian. I love RVT but I gotta mix it with Green Bali to get the most out of it. Redosing is cool if you don't feel like you got enough of an effect, but not if you just ate. 




 I think I would like to own it. 




 Heyyy-ooooooo iOSPoundcake. You made a fine choice. RVT is the stuff dreams are made of. Is that an Apple computer I see? You dirty traitor.  




 I just looked at your post history under your username... you did morphine three days ago. How dare you come here and chastise us. Just because you're a morphine addict doesn't mean you have to drag people who are maintaining a positive lifestyle down with you. Shut the fuck up. 




 I, too, would like to know how much he took. 




 Shoot it into your dick vein. 




 ROGER THAT ROGER THAT TEN FOUR MOTHER FUCKER I CAN DIG IT LOUD AND CLEAR I GOT THAT GINGER CANDY ON STAND-BY READY TO ROLL IF THAT SHIT GETS REAL YA HEARD SICK TWISTED GINGER GAME SO HARD CARTMAN BE HATIN NAMSAYIN  




 YEAH NIGGGUHHHHH THAT'S THAT SHIT I'M TALKIN ABOUT BABY BIG DOG BONERTICKLER STYLE I'MA OVERDO IT AND HAVE A WICKED HEADACHE IN THE MORNING AND EVERYTHING IT'S GONNA BE TIGHT BUTTHOLE 




 AH-CHA-CHA
 




 GOOD THING I GOT THAT RED THAI COMIN IN HOT FROM IDAHO TODAY YEAH NIGGGUHHHHHH STRAIN SWITCH 




 No, I hate whites and Maeng Da so I'm not sayin just mix anything with reds... I'm just saying from my own personal experience that mixing Green Bali with reds gets me exactly what I'm looking for.  




 Oh and mix Green Vein Bali with the Red Vein Borneo, or Red Sumatran or Red Thai or whatever. That's the ticket, boy. 




 It will definitely help with premature ejaculation, but it will have a detrimental effect on your sex drive. It's all about timing. Sex might not seem appealing an hour after ingestion, but you'll last as long as you want to in bed. Or in the kitchen... Basically wherever your slampig likes doing it. But there is a sweet spot, somewhere between 3-5 hours after ingestion... at least for me. A little trial and error is in order... but oh Jesus lord, prepare to pay for it dearly if you decide to quit taking kratom. You think you blow your nut quick now? It'll be ten times worse after you quit, until enough time passes by and you go back to normal... which, your normal is premature anyway. It's quite a predicament.  




 me fuckin too. great phone but desperately needs root.
 




 The doc uses kratom?
 




 Sometimes all it takes to cure kratom-dick is a little of the test_subject7558's eloquence.  




 Are you ready to stop touching children? 




 I wouldn't give kratom to my cat. He has to be ready for peanut butter time at a moment's notice. 




 That's extremely common. Generally speaking, if you execute sexy-time with your old lady, you'll still end up with a boner and the desire to make her fat rolls quiver. You just have to go for it. 




 He wakes up, hits the bathroom for a quick jack-off (his wife is a cunt), and then he uses a trowel to scoop heaps of phenibut into his mouth. Then he mumbles and stumbles for a bit, bumps his head on some things, gets some coffee and walks to work. Then he's set for the day. He says his hands have never been as steady as phenibut makes them. I suppose that's a good thing, considering he's a dentist. 




 What a coincidence. I introduced my dentist to phenibut and now he can't start his day without a phenibut OD-blackout. He says it really hits the spot, gets his juices flowing. 




 Dude, an activation rig consists of a magnetron daisy-chained inline with a 2 farad capacitor (500 volt of course) and a low-fidelity digitizer. Do you even kratom, bro? I feel so bad for people who ingest dormant kratom... my life hasn't been the same since I built my activation rig. 




 Just dump it out into a pile on a GLASS plate, and get a TV remote. Make sure the batteries in the remote are good. Point the remote at the pile while holding down one button for 20 minutes... any button, doesn't matter. After 20 minutes, all static will have dissipated no matter how large the pile. Make sure you don't let go of the button at any time while you're pointing the remote at it or you'll have to start all over again. 




 Huh? Are you being sarcastic or is there something I don't know? Facebook? 




 You are thoroughly entertaining me, and I appreciate it.
 




 WHAT 




 No problem. Glad to help. 
























 Well, call me selfish, but the more it's in the public, the more popular it will get, and the more attention it will receive from authorities. If head shops didn't sell it, it would never even garner any attention from anybody, you know? Sure, responsible people find out about it in head shops and start using it. Kids and people looking for legal highs find out about it too. I would rather just keep it out of the public's eye. I'm sure there's an honest head shop here and there, but it's just not fuckin worth all the publicity it causes kratom to receive, whether it's from honest head shops or elsewhere. Hell, even bath salts and spice would still be legal if it wasn't for head shops (not that they should be, but that's beside the point). Funny thing is, a lot of junkies are too myopic to order stuff from the internet, whether it's from a darknet market or from a website. Doesn't matter if it's cheaper, doesn't matter if it's safer, they can't wait a few days for it to show up. I showed all my friends how to use Silk Road, you know how many used it besides me? One. Just one, and he wasn't opioid dependent, which may have played a role. All the rest just didn't want to wait. Nobody ever wants to wait. Also, most of the junkies I know don't have a debit card, they couldn't order any bath salts from the internet if they wanted to, because they don't have the ambition to actually get a fuckin debit card, and that alone would always stop them. If bath salts and spice never hit head shops, they would both still be legal. They'd just be another couple of obscure research chemicals. TL;DR All head shops aren't bad, but they're all bad news for the fight to keep kratom legal. 




 Yeah man me too. I used to love the darknet. Now I go on every once in a while just cuz I'm curious, but I have to get off it before too long. I start getting ideas in my head. lol. 




 I imagine they don't buy hard drugs cuz they can't get them. I definitely want head shops to stop selling it. I've never even seen it in a head shop (I haven't been to one in years) but from what I gather, they mostly sell extracts, right? Just goes to show that they're trying to peddle a legal high, and not an herbal remedy... like most of us here see it as. "Bath salts" or "spice" are all the assholes and feds think when they see the shit in head shops. It's a fucked up situation man, and the shit causes me a great deal of anxiety. I don't know what I'll do if it ever gets banned. I hate to think of going on a darknet market for the shit. Next thing I know, I'll have grams of ice and H showing up at my doorstep. But, we all know that for each stupid mother fucker that abuses it and buys it in head shops, there's 10 people that buy it on the internet and use it to improve their lives in a responsible manner. It undoubtedly does more good than harm, I just hope the lawmakers can see that if the unfortunate situation arises. 




 Go and get yourself a prepaid debit card gift card deally and get it online. Fuck head shops.

 Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast, my nigger. 




 Been up a while? Whatter ya? One of them damn blue collar tweakers? 




 I just called Thailand and told them they've got a kratom smuggler comin in hot in about 3 hours. You might wanna start sticking fingers up your bunghole now so it doesn't hurt so bad when they get their hands on ya. Maybe you can pay another passenger some kratom to help you out with it. I heard wieners work best for that sort of thing. 




 WHEN YOU WANT TO GO DO IT 




 Don't do it. 




 Dude. You need to get your shit together and either eat the rest of it or flush it down the toilet. I can't even imagine what life in a Thailand prison is like. The prisons over here are bad enough, and this is mother fucking America baby. 




 Nope. Not safe. You'll die. 




 It was in the bible. Jesus said "And he who hath understanding of the kratom plant shall be king shit, and I will taketh thine ballsack into my mouth and gargle it ever so gently, to the window, and to the wall, and until the sweat drippeth down thine ballsack." 




 Quit lyin. That's gravel you got out the parking lot bro. 




 Ohhhhh nvm. The way you said it, I thought she lowered your Vikes and gave you nothing else because you asked for Opanas. Ha. 




 Seriously? 




 50 mg of morphine? 1500 mg of morphine? Who knows, right? I assume since you use a shirt as a filter, you probably don't possess the equipment or the know-how to find out. Get the fuck outta here with that shit. 




 This guy gets it. 




 Every dose got me feelin like Jesus is gargling my ballsack. 




 Boy, that SWIM shit is beyond retarded. As if it's the whole reason G men aren't swinging in through your windows. 




 I dose 3 times a day, about 5 grams each time. I never take any sort of tolerance break. Sometimes I feel extra sassy, and dose a fourth time. If I do that two days in a row, my tolerance goes up a little... I feel it less the next day, but as long as I only take it 3 times that day, it'll be back to normal the day after. I think it's all about finding the perfect dose. I also mix greens with red. 




 I throw 2 grams under my tounge, then take a sip of water and swish it around, making sure none stays under my tongue..... and then I just kick my head back like a dog and swallow. 




 If you really absolutely need to know, somebody on this page can tell you: http://beijing.usembassy-china.org.cn/contact_us.html

You'll never guess how I found that page (It starts with a G). So do I refer to you as "mastuh" from here on out or what? 




 I almost just fell for it again, you sneaky asshole 




 I was just about to search Google to find out, then I realized that would make me your bitch. 




 Not exactly a great range to work with, especially on something as subtle as kratom can already be. 




 I've read that the effects are anywhere from minimal to non-existent. 




 I have to combine a green (Bali) with my reds in order to get what I'm looking for. Was the Vietnam enhanced? 




 DO YOU GET IT 




 I got a pretty lose asshole. Mom used to make me sit on the bed post as a punishment when I was a little boy.  




 H and go. Best combo on Earth (Not on the same shot though). 




 I think I found him https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xA0ZHEwU2Q 




 Yep. Will be 2 years in June. I don't know, I don't even understand what his angle is. He thinks kratom is the devil and we're all going to graduate to heroin one day because we do kratom now.  




 I'd be more impressed by his ability to recognize me in the obituaries when he doesn't know what my name is. 




 Just got this one shortly after ----- http://imgur.com/qloNVN3 ------- I've seemed to acquire an admirer on Valentine's Eve. I am truly one lucky fellow. 









 Sprinkle it on a hotdog  




 I chew. All day long. I love it. Haven't smoked a bogie in quite some time. I have asthma, so I don't give a fuck what people say, chew is way healthier for me. I love chewin on kratom but I dose at like 6:30 am, and I don't get a dip in until about 7:45 when I get to work. I can't say it really affects the kratom either way for me, although I am pretty much fiending for it by the time I get to work. I just find it makes me want the chaw more. However, thanks to the chaw, I drink about a gallon of water a day... it just makes me so thirsty. I know hydration is especially important when taking kratom, so it works out, as far as I'm concerned. 




 You're a dentist? You must not be a very good one, cuz my dentist always tells me to open my mouth... not shut it. 




 Oh ok. Makes sense. 




 Oh shit. I'm not. What are they? 




 Monstrous first dose, unless you're opioid tolerant. 




 I'm not pissed. I just like being vulgar sometimes. 




 Kratom keeps me off the heroin, you filthy fuckin asshole 




 Your username is wonderful. 




 It's been 21 months for me. I'm gonna get wrecked when I retire. lol 




 Could be quality issues. Or you just may not respond well to Bali. Only way to find out for sure is to try another strain (from a recommended vendor, if you aren't already using one). 




 WHY YOU HATIN BRO QUIT HATIN 




 You should definitely be worried. The cops called me the other day and said they're about to come arrest you for putting too many wieners in your mouth. 




 Why should they lower their price? Look at all the fucking people that pay it. lol. I would do the same thing if I were them. 




 Hey no problem. You can give me reddit gold if you'd like. 




 Are you implying he was murdered by a rival kratom kingpin? Maybe it was a DEA hit.  




 Mail it. 




 She compared it to cheese? 




 I wish more people would compare it to cheese. A sharp cheddar gets me higher than anything I know, baby. 




 Alright if he felt that great that's fine but Jesus let's not go on a public forum and compare the shit to morphine and mdma and klonopin and go on about how fucked up we were on something that we all want to remain legal. He could have described his euphoria perfectly fucking fine without all of those embellishments, do you think? I'm not saying he didn't feel that way.  




 Gotta agree with you about the banning thing. Really stupid to make these kinds of comparisons. 




 My username is relevant 




 Calm the fuck down would ya? Jesus. 




 That's enhanced Maeng Da. For sustainability's sake, you really ought to go with a plain leaf.  




 No ragrets
 




 Back to doin the dirty, brother.... back to doin the dirty. 




 Thank you 




 Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. 




 I don't know if it's fine or not. I just know I do it and nothing has ever happened. 




 I was under the impression that the kratom vendors are the ones who get shut down for accepting Paypal. I use my Paypal card all the time to buy it. I dunno.
 
























 Herbal Salvation, you would have to order in bulk to get that price though. 




 lol. Yes. 20 dollars for 25 grams is too much. I think I pay 5 dollars for 25 grams. 




 Just looking at it makes me feel like you spent a lot of money for it. At least it's good quality though. 




 That's interesting. I was gonna say to mix a green with a red and up the dose to around six grams but if you tried one from each for a total of six grams, Idk what good it would do to try my idea. 




 Are you taking different strains or just mostly one? Are you mixing your strains in your doses at all? 




 Ohhhhhhh. No chance of that. Not after only a few days. 




 Yeah just add more to it, although I can't imagine there would be enough stuck on the inside of the bottle to actually do anything. I mean, even a gram stuck on the inside of a bottle would look like a shit load. 




 Yeah I thought about mentioning that but decided to only mention the ones I've actually done myself. Smoking oxy seems like it would be such a waste compared to shooting it. lol 




 I would think that extract would be the only way to go, if one was to attempt it. 




 I would like some free kratom please. 




 Black tar heroin. Opium. Fentanyl gel.  




 Ha. Some people just aren't built for toss and wash. Not necessarily an allergy. 




 NEVER MIND. NOW I'M NOT GONNA GET ANY. 




 OH MAN I'M GONNA GET SOME NOW 




 Oh really? Sometimes I think about trying it, but I have an extremely addictive personality and the last thing I need is another habit... especially something that could possibly cause withdrawal like that. 




 Fucking alarm clocks, how do they work? 




 The only thing I know about phenibut is you're not supposed to take it every day cuz the withdrawal will have you fucked up after like two or three days of consecutive use. 




 That's a true statement. 




 Oh.. and some say it suppresses appetite. I demolish shit after I dose, though. 




 Some people say it's good to have a little something in your stomach. I am not one of those people. The emptier the better, as far as my body is concerned. Don't ever take it when you're full though. It'll be wasted. 




 Yeah. I throw it under my tongue and then swig water, mix it around in my mouth so it's not stuck to anything, then kick my head back like a dog and swallow. Always had a bad time trying to put it on my tongue. It's the most efficient method concerning preparation time, effort, effects, and onset time. Some people just can't do it though. 




 Real men have to shoot their load all over themselves when they toilet jerk cuz their wieners are too long to aim down into the toilet. 




 Well. You could try lowering your dose little by little and see if those effects go away. You could also try switching strains, or your vendor. I take 5-6 grams three times a day and have never had any problems like that. Everybody's different though. Strain/vendor switch would probably be worth a try if you haven't already. 




 It's not an extract, just leaf. Take 2-3 grams to start off, just to be safe. Real men toss and wash. 




 If you're opioid tolerant, which you are, 3 grams of kratom isn't shit. If you were deeper into withdrawal when you took it, you would probably notice it more. I personally would try 5-6 grams on an empty stomach. That's me though. You may still not feel much, unless you give it a few weeks and lose your tolerance. 




 Mmm. Pita bread. 




 A fat naked lady shows up and poops on an old man's chest. 




 I'm not sure that classifies as boiling water. 




 Yeah man I tried it again yesterday. Trash. I'm done fuckin with it. I'm sure other people love it but RVS and RVT all day long for me baby. 




 I'M FREAKIN OUT 




 Can you elaborate  




 Huh? 




 Try doing them with a dildo jammed up your asshole. 




 Incognitooooo 




 Donna and the cocktasters. 




 Wut. 




 Hopefully I enjoy it someday, but as of now, I don't even want to try it again. Lol. How much RVS do you normally take? And how much Maha Kali? The same amount? 




 Sure. Send me some money so I can buy some, you stupid asshole. 




 Fuck man. I heard that too. Try mixing them tomorrow instead of today.
 




 Good, I'm glad to know I'm not the only one who notices it. Yes, my Bali and RVT are both from HS. Try the 2:1 RVT to Bali ratio, if you have some on hand. It's something special. 




 "i was talking about grammer". I know bro, I was talking about grammar too. Did you mean to say "wasn't" instead of "was"? You somehow just made yourself into a great example, supporting my earlier reference to your grammar. Speaking of English classes, you should go see if a professor will pay you to be a case study. A lot can be learned by attempting to read the trainwreck nonsense you type up. I NEVER point out people's grammatical errors. I'm far from a grammar nazi. I just couldn't help pointing out your ironic statement. TL;DR You're lucky I don't know you personally or I'd come FISTFUCK YOU IN THE COCKSUCKER. 




 Ok well I've taken single strains by themselves only about 102746 times, and it never gets me to where I want to be no matter what. Mixing Green Bali with reds is what does it for me. I wouldn't even be taking kratom if I wasn't mixing them the way I do because it wouldn't have the effect I'm looking for. I wasn't asking why I'm not satisfied, I'm asking if anybody else notices the same thing when they first try a new strain. The same thing happened to me with RVS, RVB, RVT, and RV Hulu Kapuas... I took them twice to begin with and didn't feel much, and then after that they started working great. Also, I don't mean to be a dick either, but I find it strange you think I sound like a kid when I'm the one who uses correct grammar, and you can't even be bothered to spell out the word "you". Either way, thanks for the advice. 




 Alright alright alright. So I usually take 5-6 grams of Red Vein Sumatran/Green Bali mixed at a 2:1 ratio, respectively. I do this before work in the morning, and then after work in the late afternoon. Then at about 8 I dose one more time, except I substitute Red Vein Thai for the RVS. I do that just for kicks, mostly. Well, the time came to order some more Green Bali, and I decided to cop a 25 gram sack of that Maha Kali everybody keeps going on and on about. Well, the shit came today. I just got home and jammed 6ish grams down my cocksucker, same mixture ratio as usual but using Maha Kali in place of the RVS. A half hour or so has past, and by now, I would usually be feeling great. But at this point I'm actually regretting not taking my usual RVS. I definitely always feel better than this by now. However... I've noticed in the past that the first one or two times I take a new strain, it doesn't seem to do much for me. I'm hoping that's the situation here. Does anybody else notice that happening to them? 




 I'm not your pops. Him and I are Eskimo brothers, though. 




 You've got your work cut out for you, son. 




 Thanks for contributing to this conversation. Leave it to shmooly the fuckfaced asshole to point out things we already know. 




 That's the only place I can find any word of it. Have you found it anywhere else? It's kind of strange that they're telling you to stock up while you can lol, considering they sell it. 




  I appreciate your humor. 




 That brother Phalze thought Miami was so nice, he had to live there twice. 




 I had the exact same reaction a couple times. The first was the only time I ever tried a white vein, and the second was the last time I took Maeng Da. I only took a half gram of it.  




 Upstate NY 




 Wayward apostrophes gave my mom the shingles.  




 You say settle down, but your username unsettles my scrotum pretty severely. 




 Idk what strain viva Zen is but I'm pretty sure everybody here is just going to tell you to buy some plain leaf strains and cap your own. You'll save like one million dollars a day. 




 Yeah. My sweet spot is six grams but everybody's different, would be a shame to start at four and end up taking more everyday than he needs to. 




 Start at 2. 




 Ha. I play guitar. I was bluffing again though. I'm not gonna write a song about this. I have a bluffing problem. 




 I'm gonna write a song about this someday. 




 A toilet jerk? 




 That's a pretty good idea. I was bluffing about a toiler jerk at work though. At work means on the kratom. On the kratom means no toilet jerks. My right arm isn't toned enough to deal with a kratom jack toilet jerk. 




 Imgur 4 life 




 I just assume USPS is going to be late when I'm putting an order in. I do it like 2-3 weeks ahead of time. I'd much rather do that than pay those FedEx or UPS fuckfaces to do it. 




 "Exploded when it hit my throat" Thanks for giving me an at-work boner. Might have to go for a toilet jerk. 




 I..... I love it 




 lol. I love using my smartphone on the toilet. I dunno about you, but my pisser works funny on kratom. It's sort of stop and go sometimes, and I love using my smartphone on the toilet so much, that I always piss sitting down too. I end up spending like 10 minutes on the toilet every time I piss, and my bitch always ends up yellin at me. She thinks I jerk it in there. Sometimes I do jerk it, though, if it's been long enough since my last dose. Toilet jerks are one of life's greatest simple pleasures. 




 I spend most of my free time trying to shit. 
























 Yes 




 From all the bad batches I keep hearing about from here and there, I'm sure as fuck not venturing out and trying a new vendor anytime soon lol. I'm content enough as it is, even if some people say it's mediocre (which I don't think it is), at least I know what I'm getting.  




 I don't mind the taste, I just dislike the texture of a finely ground powder. I like my kratom coarse. Luckily my recent kilo is some of the coarsest I've had lol. 




 Floppycock syndrome. 




 Yeah, I find it strange that people think a find grind is a selling point lol. 




 That's how you know it's good. 




 You have a trust fund? Can I have some money? I give a great handjob.  




 I prefer coarse kratom. I find it easier for toss and wash. I could see why somebody who makes tea would like the finely ground variety, though. 




 I'm the same way, I can take all the red veins I want, and I can take green Bali, but any other green and any white veins make me feel like shit.. along with Maeng Da, too. I'm so envious of people that can take a white or green vein and catch a good energy buzz before work. I'm always falling asleep on my fuckin way to work. Lol. I would like to take just Bali in the mornings but more than a couple grams of it gives me fuckin nausea.  




 TIL red vein kratom is also known as Maeng Da, and you have to ingest twenty grams of it to get any effects. 




 It stopped happening to me ever since I quit doing somersaults. 




 Knotted Johnson.       http://www.lovebryan.com/friends/brunt/data/upimages/hippiespenismold.jpg 




 No problem. 




 Yeah I got it today, I took it with 2 g of green Bali and 2 g of red vein Thai. I wasn't impressed lol. 




 Drug of choice 




 What 




 You should have said "HEY. I DON'T COME TO YOUR HOUSE AND TELL YOU HOW TO TICKLE BONERS." 




 I don't like guides that try to get me to buy stuff. 




 Yeah, he obviously has some deep-seated issues. I attempted to skim through all his drivel and I'm pretty sure he's on probation and he lives in Florida where kratom might be outlawed soon. He'll have to come to terms with his own drug dependence soon and he's afraid, so he's lashing out. Hey, this armchair psychology stuff is pretty fun. I can almost see why he does it. Wait... no... no, I can't. He's just a stupid asshole. Yes. That's it.  




 Lol I know man. I commented in your defense on that thread. The sad thing is, he's not just a troll, he actually believes the things he's saying. I think he may be mentally retarded. 




 Yeah, everybody else is deluded. It's not just you or anything.  




 SWIM knows exactly how it is. 




 Oh shit. I forgot all about Opiophile. I was more of a Bluelight man myself. 




 Dude. There was a couple times I made the mistake of browsing the "dope porn"  over at /r/opiates. I was ready to hit the fucking darknet. That was almost as bad as seeing it in person. If I didn't have kratom, it would have been over. 




 So he chooses to be on kratom instead of hard drugs, and you say he's doing the wrong thing... yet you're forced to resort to kratom because you aren't allowed to do hard drugs, and you think you're doing the right thing? That's definitely backwards junkie mentality if I've ever seen it. You're just a fiend doing whatever substances you can get away with. Admitting you're a junkie doesn't make your actions better than his. Stop glorifying yourself. 




 Idk why the fuck you didn't take a picture of it man.  




 You obviously have a way with words. 




 Toss and wash. Is there any other way?' 




 I feel sharper on kratom, especially compared to opiates. On opiates I spend the majority of my time with my face resting in a bowl of ice cream.  




 Yeah. Apparently that note is 40 percent of your purchase, so you're gonna wanna go ahead and make sure you get that. I know I personally can't even enjoy kratom if I don't have a short note to read while I'm taking it.  




 I don't know. Call Bill Nye. Keep slurping soggy kratom water if that's what you want to do.  




 Yeah but HS doesn't send you a hand written note like MS does. I've been told that's an important thing to look for in a vendor. 




 But HS costs half as much as MS does. You must be lying. 




 No. You didn't get nausea the second time because you took (less than) 4g. The 7g dose was too much for your first time.  




 So definitely mix it with some Green Bali or some shit then? I suppose I was figuring on maybe a g of RVS with 2 G of Bali along with the 2 G of RVT/GS. Not real sure why i ordered it. I coulda got an extra long BBQ burger at Burger King. Them things are outta control. 




 VaginaHen66 




 Yeah it certainly doesn't seem like a good idea to use it daily, I guess I just had $7.50 burning a hole in my pocket. Lol. I look forward to giving it a shot though. 




 I do not experience this.... on a somewhat related note, does anybody else sneeze when they get horny? 




 I don't think "Long story short" means what you think it means. 




 In the snow. And we liked it. 




 You gotta wake up pretty early in the mother fuckin morning to get one past old TheMaddLib. 




 You crawled 10 blocks? Literally? 




 Everybody is different. I stopped for 10 days, about an 18 gram a day habit, and I only slept an hour a night for the first 7 days.... definitely not "slight insomnia" for me. Fuck that shit. Fuck it in its stupid asshole.  




 Alright I'm gonna have to give that a shot. I prefer mixing reds with greens so I would imagine it's the way to go. 




 IDK if I can stretch my pisshole wide enough to fit 2 grams up there. 




 Alright, so we all know extracts can fuck up your tolerance. I don't have much experience with extracts, I got some several years ago but I was shooting dope daily and therefore I never really felt it when I took it. Well, today I was on HS ordering some of my usual Green Bali and the Red Vein Thai/Gold Standard extract caught my eye, so I decided to order 2 grams of it. Does anybody have any experience with that product specifically from HS? How was it? My usual dose is around 5-6 grams, should I just take the whole 2 grams?  Is one dose of this extract going to fuck my tolerance up all that bad? Thanks in advance. 




 This never happened. I appreciate the effort you guys put into your site, though. 




 Dude. Those photos are pretty sweet. I like how they call one room a "drying facility", and all it's just a shelf with leaves hanging off of it and then the floor is just covered with them. lol. 




 Oh. I think my Ma did her thesis on it in college. 




 Thanks man. Interesting stuff. I like the idea of taking it as a daily potentiator. I've never really tried anything to potentiate other than grapefruit juice. I may give it a shot. Lowering tolerance a bit couldn't hurt either. 




 I read somewhere that a regular diet of tube steak helps your daily kratom doses just slide down your throat. 




 When I take too much and raise my tolerance, I just continue taking it at my same usual dose. The first and second day might not be as strong but it's always back to normal by the third day. I dunno if I'm just lucky in that aspect or what. 




 I would like to see those links please. Thanks. 




 Put it into a different container and just use a spoon to dip into it, rather than pouring it out. 




 Same here, drinking sucks. Kratom is wayyyy better. 




 You need to go to the hospital immediately.  




 Yeah that's pretty gangster.  




 Boy, I must be some sort of retard. I thought you meant send the kratom to a lab. I tried imagining your buddy sending a cooler full of urine specimens in with a sack of kratom tucked into it. Ha. 




 Yeah, like, he's gotta be a big shot, stretchin buttholes all throughout the land. 




 How much does it cost? I dunno the first thing about sending something into the lab like that. 




 Lol that's around my ceiling for the day, divided into three doses. I was being sorta sarcastic, I just thought it's funny Because it's not that much but sounds like a lot because you asked about milligrams instead of grams lol. There's a lot of people that take a lot more than that. 




 This guide sucks 




 I just wanted to let you know that I take 18000 milligrams a day. Don't act like you're not impressed. 




 It's the "The" part of the name that really does it for me. The Butthole Man. It's got a sick ring to it.  




 Yeah man they're fucked 




 "The Butthole Man" would be a great name for a porn star.  
























 Please let us know of your results. 




 Can we get a confirmation on where you got it from or what? Jesus. I need it in my life. 




 Sometimes out of nowhere I'll go through a nausea kick, no matter which strain I use. Just had one recently, about 3 weeks ago. Lasted about a week. IDK where they come from but I'm glad they leave lol. 




 There's no way of knowing whether it will help the worst of your withdrawals, because we don't know how much morphine will be in your tea. It has the potential to get you higher than kratom ever could if it's a good batch, so obviously that would obliterate withdrawals. There's just no way to know without either doing it or doing some fancy pants lab magic and finding out how much morphine is in it. And yeah, definitely a cross tolerance. I mean, maybe if you sip tiny amounts every day, don't even catch any sort of buzz, and just not get sick... I suppose kratom may work again after a while of that. But I don't really know, there's just no telling with PST.  




 Yep. Nope. Bad idea. Since poppy seed tea is essentially morphine, it would make much more sense to use kratom to get off poppy seed tea, rather than the other way around. Heh. Not to mention, poppy seed tea is a huge crap shoot. You could get 6 mg of morphine, or you could get 600 and fucking die.  




 Super sketch son. 




 Same here. It would be cool if the KGs were about 50 bucks cheaper... there's a lot of places that are definitely cheaper than HS... but with HS, I know what I'm getting, and you can't put a price on that. 




 Never been there, but I've been to Texas. The first time I ever tried ice was in Texas, I forgot to drink water for 3 days and ended up in the hospital. I've been careful to hydrate very well ever since then, especially on meth... not that I do meth anymore. 




 Probably dippin into OP's kratom sacks. 




 Somebody in Austin be fuckin up. 




 Get a tracheotomy done and just scoop the kratom directly into your neck hole. 




 Why you stirring the pot, son? 




 Here you go. http://www.freeflys.com/ 




 Sick prices bro. 

You misspelled "speciosa" up near the top of the page. 

You misspelled "difference" in your motto "Smell the difference". I see you "copyrighted" it, you'll probably want to fix that quick cuz a copyright symbol after a blundered phrase looks sort of unprofessional. 

Under "The Truth" page, you have "comeback" instead of "come back", the latter being correct the correct version. 

You also have "headyherb@outlook.com" as your email, which could very well be your email, I just wanted to let you know just in case it's supposed to say "headyherbs@outlook.com".

I'll keep an eye out for reviews on your shit. Interested to see what's up. 




 Me too 




 I've only ordered from MS twice, both times it was Bali and for some reason I was having a negative reaction to it... never had their red veins. I'm sure MS's other stuff is good or whatever but I haven't tried anything else from them. Some people say the quality is the same, some say HS's quality is lower, some say it's higher, but the one thing I do know is that it's just a better deal. I'm not trying to plug for HS or anything, just sharing my experience. There are vendors out there who are cheaper than HS and supposedly have just as good or better quality but I haven't tried them so I can't recommend any of them personally. 




 http://www.herbal-salvation.com/cat/Ingredients.cfm/id/RVTPWDR boom. There's a second page with more products on it. That's where the Thai hides. Red vein Borneo is great too but the red vein Sumatran is my favorite. The quality is great. The shipping label says Viable Solutions, LLC. The bags of kratom have strain name, company name, and not meant for human consumption. Not sure which you meant by labeling. 




 5g when you get up, 5g between 3-5 pm, 5g around 9. Keep doing it even if it doesn't seem to satisfy your urge, because you're not satisfied the way you're doing it now anyway. If you stick to that, each day you'll start to feel it a little more, and eventually you'll get back to feeling good from it again. I've done it in this rhythm for six months and it works perfectly for me. Sometimes I took too much for a couple days and screwed up my tolerance, I just stuck to my usual dose and it went right back down. I have one of those nifty 2 and 6 gram scoops from HS, and a scale, although I don't use either because I know what 2g looks like now.  EDIT: I get up at 6 AM. The timing of your second and third dose are obviously relative compared to the time your first dose of the day is. Second dose should be between 9-11 hours after your first dose, and then your third dose would be 15 hours after you wake up, roughly. Might take some tweaking but I think it would work. 




 Lol you're on this shit every day, how did it take you 17 days to see it? You must be in a fierce kratom fog. I want. 




 He surely was. 




 RVS. RVT. RVB.  




 Don't ever apologize for taking the test_subject7558's side, son. 




 Yep, I referred to it in this thread the other day: http://www.reddit.com/r/kratom/comments/2zv9w1/been_ordering_from_same_vendor/

I thought I was the only one who felt that way. 

A lot of people say the differences between vein colors are all in your head, but they don't know what it's like to be sensitive to certain veins. It's pretty fuckin blatantly obvious to me. 




 I just wanted to show you what a healthy log looks like. Why must you hate? I did it for you, man... I did it for you. 




 As if "Leslie" is a better name for a dude.  




 IF YOU LOVE IT SO MUCH, WHY DON'T YOU MARRY IT 




 No, it's a person who sells toilets... sort of like a soda jerk sells sodas. You don't want to take kratom before them because they're notoriously selfish, you should always offer them the first dose. You can't blame them, you would be selfish too if you spent your days trying to talk people into buying something to shit in. 




 Don't act like you're not impressed. 




 Relevant: http://imgur.com/i4KwIc9         (NSFW) 




 Precisely. My grandfather was Phallus Tickler, Esq. Surely you've heard of him. 




 I suppose that depends who you ask. 




 If there's one thing I know about redosing, it's that you don't do it right before a toilet jerk, or you're gonna have a bad time. 




 My middle name is Redose. Boner Redose Tickler. 




 What. 




 I always had a crush on Bea Arthur. I'd eat her shit if she needed me to.  




 Sometimes I run out of spring water and I have to use ginger ale (that I usually chase with as an anti-nausea tool) and I'm always surprised at how easy it is. It's like it fizzes up when it mixes with the kratom and makes it so I can't really feel the powder I'm swallowing, just soda fizz.  




 Gotta be. 




 You ever try to taper off the tram? I can't even imagine how tram has you by the balls like that. Kratom does way more for me effects-wise than tram ever has. I don't even feel tram, I think I must be what they call a non-responder.  




 Why don't you quit being a dickface  




 YMMV, my nuggah. 




 I've used it several times for other things and I never received it the next day. It was 2 days every time. 




 I hear that loud and clear man. It's a pain right in the nutsack. 




 I'm envious of you then lol. Last time I took a half g of Maeng Da, my skull felt like it was caving in. Weird shit man. 




 So the only angle they must have is a plan to reveal the strain names after so long then right? That would be the only thing that makes sense. It's still not right to leave people clueless about whether they're uppers or downers or inbetweeners though. Granted, people don't have to take them, but it just seems like a foolish move on MS's part. But then again, they must be doing something right lol. 




 Unbiased? Why do they need it unbiased? Are they taking surveys from them to find out which ones they like? This is a serious question, I do not know. And I'm not mad, I just don't get it. I am a touch jelly of their sick loot sacks and notoriety though. 




 Yeah man, I cannot believe that MS hands out samples and doesn't even clue people in on whether it's an upper or a downer strain. Upper strains seriously make me feel like I'm going to have a seizure. Idk what kind of slick bullshit MS thinks they're up to, they could at least inform people of the vein color or up/down effect. You would think they would at least do that for their loyal customers that pay $50 for 100 grams like it's the only god damn kratom source on Earth. But no, it's all a secret fuck fuck game, as if they have secret formulas they don't want other vendors to steal or some shit. I just don't understand what people see in them. I don't get it, and I'm actually really jelly of MS, cuz those mother fuckers are ballin big dog style. Tons of customers paying that kind of money, I can't even imagine what their profits are like. I hope someday I run a legal racket half as profitable as they do. 




 I have a penis and not a vagina so I toss and wash. 




 Smoking black tar heroin can stop your shitter right up. A lot of people here seem to believe that the reason your shitter gets stopped up is because we're consuming all that powder. I personally believe it's the effect of the drug and its alkaloids on your body that cause the constipation, not because of the powder physically stopping you up. I can take Bali from any vendor at 18 grams a day and shit like a pro. But if I throw red vein Sumatran into the mix, as I always do, my shitter jams right up and stops working. You could start taking a tiny 8 mg Suboxone pill once a day and you might not shit for a week, and it's certainly not because the pill is causing some sort of obstruction. It's just what opioid(ish) substances do. Am I saying consuming 50 grams a day isn't going to physically obstruct your bowels to a degree? No, it could certainly contribute, but the primary reason your shitter doesn't shit is because of the alkaloids within the leaf, not the leaf itself.  




 I changed the blade halfway through the shave, no difference. I tried all angles. I might cop some feather blades and give it a shot, but if that doesn't work, I don't know that I want to drop however  much money on a nicer one if it's not going to do the deed. 




 Some cheap ass piece of shit from eBay. That's why I'm wondering if it just doesn't hold the razor at the correct angle or some shit. 




 I haven't tried a different blade yet, just the Astra ones that came with it. I planned on trying some feather blades I guess? What blades do you use? 




 Show him your reddit username, or else. 




 14 years old and you own a tea company? I need to reevaluate my life. 




 Ohhhh so you and I just blew their cover? Dang. How could we be so stupid?  




 What is this burn you guys keep talking about? Do you mean you're smoking it? You're probably constipated cuz you're smoking it bro. Cut that shit out. 




 Nope, it's on correctly. Thanks though. 




 Alright, I got a safety razor off eBay for 10 bucks, it came with 5 Astra blades. Sometimes i get a halfway decent shave with it (never as good as with a disposable), other times (like tonight) I can't get close at all. I tried getting these same hairs for 20 minutes, couldn't get them, then grabbed a double blade disposable and immediately eradicated them with one swipe. I changed the blade on the safety razor, did not help at all. I also tried all angles of holding it. I shaved with the grain, against the grain, and sideways. I really want to like this razor. I really do. I feel like a big dog when I shave with it but I don't look like a big dog without a big dog smooth shave. Does it just not bend the blade to the correct angle? Would a Gillette Fatboy really make a difference? Or should I just call it quits and go back to disposables? Thanks in advance. 




 I took it maybe 6 or 7 times back in the day, and I always took 300 mg. I stopped taking it because it's just fuckin retarded, but I was never sensitive to it like this back then. I dunno but you're right, no DXM ever again. 




 I took kratom at 8 pm tonight, a full 24 hours after I took the 15 mg of DXM. I can still feel the DXM more than the kratom. I just hope tomorrow morning the shit is finally fuckin gone because I can't deal with this dex glow anymore. The fact that I can still feel it so much is blowing my fucking mind apart. 




 Go on the darknet and find somebody who will relay and ship the kratom to you in Indiana for a fee. 




 Why don't you just get a PO box in Ohio? Boom. Problem solved. How you wanna do this? Money order? I got Paypal too. 




 I have anxiety problems as well. Maeng Da and white veins do it to me too, along with a slew of other symptoms.  I just don't take upper strains and I don't have those problems.  




 Yeah. I should have heeded your warning.  




 Yeah they're a bunch of old mother fuckers. Early bird style 




 Thank Jesus I didn't take thirty mg like I kept reading. I'm really sensitive to some things. I gotta go to dinner with my family at 3 today, I would usually eat kratom right before but now I'm beginning to think I should skip it and maybe tonight's dose too. 




 I went ahead and tried the DXM potentiation method. I took one 15 mg coughgel thirty minutes before my dose last night. All it did was space me the fuck out and make me feel really uncomfortable and shaky. Sleep was fitful. I got up this morning feeling pretty normal again, I go drop my morning dose and fuckin bam... That bullshit feeling hits me like a ton of bricks again. Now I'm at fuckin work feeling like shit and I'm pissed. I took it last night specifically because I didn't have to work at that time. Am I going to feel it like this at my afternoon dose too? When does it go away? I took it at 8 pm last night. I feel a lot of regret for this decision. It doesn't feel like kratom potentiation at all, I don't even feel the kratom. It's more like DXM potentiation. I feel like I took 150 mg of DXM.  
























 I thought buying anything on those darknet sites was illegal because there's no sort of tax to be paid? Or is it just illegal to sell stuff on it? I swear I read that somewhere. 




 Kratom. Look into it. 




 If there's one thing I know for sure, it's that I would fuck the shit out of Joan of Arc. That's one heroine I could do all night long, baby. 




 No. Get your source on. Everybody calls each other shills though. It's a term of endearment, you see. You filthy shill. 




 WHAT
 




 Now I have a boner. 




 Empty pill bottles. 




 I'm surprised the kratom didn't just slide right down your throat nice and easy, considering all the shlong you jam down it on the regular. 




 I tried changing the permissions, it didn't work or wouldn't let me change them, I can't remember. I'll try it again and I'll check out the other thing you just mentioned when I get home. Thanks 




 I originally tried installing Tor that way (by downloading it from the website) and I could never get it started. IIRC, it would just pop up a window full of code in gedit. I looked it up and found out that I have to download it from Software Center, so I did that, and it worked. However, when I tried to reinstall it yesterday from there, it still didn't work. After I get out of work, I'll try your suggestion again. I'm gonna be pissed if I have to install a different OS just because I can't get Tor to work. Actually I should probably just set up a dedicated USB drive for it anyway. 




 I already tried that last night. Still doesn't launch. Really aggravating.  




 Pretty sure there was an automatic update installed yesterday or the day before for Tor, and I don't remember whether I tried using it since then. It worked fine before, now the browser doesn't even start. I also went to software center and downloaded Vidalia, just to see if that would work, and it didn't. I already restarted. What do? 




 2.5 billion people don't have access to toilets. 6 billion people have access to cell phones, which means there's a whole shit ton of people out there surfing reddit that don't have the luxury of pissing in a toilet. How dare you. 









 Yes, I suppose it is. I'm surprised the smear campaigns launched by the media don't tell men everywhere that they'll be pissing sitting down. Might actually deter people. I think it's great. Unless I have a boner, and it touches against the inside of the toilet. I could do without that happening to me. 




 http://www.blessedmotherschildren.com/uploads/3/0/2/8/3028145/3366178.jpg?292 




 I take 15-18 grams of kratom a day. Mostly red veins.

Because of my moderate kratom intake, I drink a gallon of water a day. 

I also chew tobacco all day long, which makes me incredibly thirsty all the time... I find that may actually work at my advantage  considering the dehydration kratom tends to cause. 

I probably piss in the toilet an average of 18 times a day. 

I realize a lot of toilet-pissing is to be expected when one drinks a gallon of water a day, but I feel like I really need to piss even more often than that should warrant.

Sometimes I'll piss in the toilet, and then 15 minutes later I'll feel like I need to piss in the toilet again, so I try to, and it takes a while for the piss to come out and then when it does, it's only like a 15 second piss. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is, I get the "gotta go piss in the toilet" sensation even when it's unwarranted. Does anybody else ever notice this? 

It's also the same sensation I get when I'm doing meth or amphetamines, I feel like I always gotta piss a little. 

I can sort of understand why that is though, because the crank is speeding my system up and pushing fluids out or whatever. 

Unfortunate thing about meth-toilet-pissing is that I always dribble into my boxers a little bit after every piss. At least the kratom doesn't seem to have the same effect.

I digress.

I also seem to have a hard time getting the piss started. There's a lot of stop-n-go hesitation my stream as well. A touch of misting going on.

Because of this, I started sitting down when I piss. I'd done it before, when I was on opiates sometimes, because I would try to piss for an hour straight, and I'll be God damned if I'm gonna fuck up my buzz by standing there trying to piss for an hour, when I could at least be sitting on the toilet and nodding for most of it.

I own a smartphone. I use it every time I'm on the toilet. This just contributes to the madness. Gotta check reddit, gotta see who's locked up on MobilePatrol, fuck around and post a couple disgusting comments on Whisper, stay up to date with imgur. 

Between the pissing and the subsequent smartphone use, I probably spend an hour and a half on the toilet every day. 

TL; DR    Does kratom make anybody else have to piss when they really shouldn't even need to?

 




 That's what you get for living in a town with shitty weed. 




 Moneygram on local bitcoin 




 I just use my old lady's mouth to shit in. 




 Do you like hot sweaty shlongs slapped against your face? 




 Had you changed anything right before the issues started (strain, vendor, food)? Sounds almost like the kratom had bacteria in it. Almost like food poisoning, maybe? I don't have much knowledge on that sort of stuff.  




 Yeah I guess it can't hurt to swap the filter out and see what happens. Just after the warranty ran out, the brake line blew, and we took it back to the garage, where I was prepared to pay the full fee in order to have it changed, and the guy did it completely for free, so maybe he'll help me out. Lol. Probably not though. Ok, so I just started it up and got it up on some ramps. It was knocking right after it started, then it stopped, I drove it up onto the ramps and while I was driving up the ramps, it started knocking loudly, and the oil pressure light came on. I got to the top of the ramp and put it in park and I hopped out to go open the hood while it was still idling, and then I sort of heard a thunk and the knocking went away and the oil pressure light shut off and then it seemed ok, other than a very small knocking noise, which I could have probably dismissed as normal any other day.  




 Oh ok, that makes sense. It didn't seem to be idling lower than usual.  The oil pressure light came on right when I got to work, when we went up the inclined driveway, then it went right back off. The story I told you above, with the stalling, all happened within half a mile from my work. I'm wondering if it's a good idea to even start it and try to drive it to the garage we got it from or not. She just got it like 45 days ago, using buy here pay here at a local garage. Unfortunately it's past the 30 day warranty but I'm hoping maybe he'll do something for us in the way of a trade or something. I'm assuming he'll say no though, since he has the right to. 




 The oil filter is mounted upside down (with the threaded side facing skyward), on the side of the block. 




 Two days ago, I changed the oil on my old lady's 2001 Chevy Impala 3800. It has 118k miles. I used a FRAM Tough Guard oil filter, and SuperTech SAE 10W-30 oil. She went to work last night, and this morning she said she heard the engine knocking. She came and picked me up and took me to work, and when we'd almost made it to work, the engine was knocking badly. I told her to pull over so I could pop the hood, and it stalled. I popped the hood, checked the oil, which was right where it should be, and hopped back in and told her to keep driving to my work. It kept knocking, we got there and it stalled. The oil pressure light also came on and back off once or twice. I read that FRAM filters often have faulty anti-drainback valves. Has anybody here ever experienced the same thing? I plan on changing the filter later today, I'm just hoping that will do the trick. I could see it causing the engine to knock and the oil pressure light to come on, but would it cause it to stall? I also checked to make sure the filter or drain bolt isn't leaking. Thanks in advance. 




 Crack them mother fuckers open if you don't feel like waiting so long for the buzz to DROP ON YOUR FACE SON 




 This is a fine post, son. 




 You'll want to use a carrier pigeon.  




 To avoid abscesses in your arms, inject it directly into your testicle.  




 Yes. -3. 




 Sounds like you may be impervious to such things. Better go get you some heroin.

You're welcome 




 In the prison I was in, you could get a haircut from an inmate barber every other day if you wanted to. You just go to the barbershop during rec. You generally bring them some tobacco, although you don't have to according to the facility's rules, it's just the polite thing to do since those barbers don't get paid much for cutting your hair. 12 cents an hour or some shit. I always just had another inmate in my dorm do it right in the bathroom with a set of clippers, though. 




 Well, he did put a hit out on a dude. What do you think he should get? lol 




 I got caught with a little bit of leftover mud from cooking meth and I got a fuckin 4 flat with 3 post... and it was for personal use! Filthy assholes. I got out on bail, then got sentenced to four years, did 4 months in regular prison until my sentence got short enough for boot camp, then I went and did 8 months of that. That boot camp is a mother fuckin life saver, I only did 1 year out of 4 because of it, but I shouldn't have been sentenced to 4 fuckin years for personal use in the first place.  




 I got a buddy that'll give you three bucks for a handjob. You can use the extra thirty cents for a couple of ramen soups. 




 I'm pissed cuz I want to see what everybody's raving about, but I'll shit in my hand and eat it before I'll ever spend more money on that shit again. 




 That's funny, I ordered the Maha Kali and it made me shaky and feel like shit. This was 2 or 3 months ago. Maybe it was the same batch you had. It was the only time I've ever tried it, I just gave it away for free the other day. 




 TL; DR  I got really high and enjoyed it but I could still talk so I might have gotten ripped off. help 




 I thought his ma was addicted to injecting semen 




 It might be a good idea to abstain from kratom for 24 hours before you do, considering the dehydration aspect of it. 




 Oh, I can see why you believed him.  Because it's totally possible to dump a spoonful of leaf grounds into a cup of coffee without the drinker even noticing. 




 Mother fuckers be trollin. Mother fuckers be fallin for it, too. They always do. 




 BOBANDY
 




 Oh I know I'm right, that's why I agree with you bro. My buddy was taking 5 grams of all natural Red Sumatran after he came down on Adderall, and it basically just took the edge off and let him sleep. I said "No, no, no, you're doing it wrong" and I handed him a few Xanax for the next time he was coming down off Adderall. He took them and just banged his head off stuff in his apartment for about an hour and then he passed out. I was happy to reduce his harm that day. We're doing the Lord's work, son. 




 You're right, benzos are much safer than kratom. What were we thinking? 




 Sometimes I get the numbers "3" and "10" confused too. 




 I just wanted to let you know that I found this post mildly entertaining. Thanks bub. 




 Red vein mother fuckin Sumatran, son. 




 Don't worry. It's probably just HIV. 




 Mine is more like  




 I jacked off into a napkin this morning. 




 I dunno. I'm being sarcastic. I have no idea what he means. 




 I'm actually the complete opposite. Kratom is the only thing I've ever found (outside of weed) that I can use at the same dose 3 times a day and still have it work every time.  




 THEY GIVE THE DASH TO YOUR POST, HOW IS THAT HARD FOR YOU TO COMPREHEND 




 The test_subject7558's hilarity is timeless, son. 




 My thoughts exactly. 




 What 




 It's done a lot for me too, man. It worries the hell out of me that there's people out there who don't know shit about it,  and they're trying to get it banned. 




 Which antiemetic do you use? 




 I've never tried it, and IDK all that much about it, but I would check this out if I was in the same predicament: https://www.bluebird.com/ 




 What are they going to report me for? Talking about things other than kratom? Kratom keeps me off the meth and other drugs. That's how it's relevant. Either way, you can't tell me what I can or can't talk about. I never portray kratom in a negative light. Are you trollin me, son?  




 Suboxone for the rest of your life? You can't even feel it every time you take it, you just feel normal. It does nothing for cravings after you're accustomed to it. I've been on the sub maintenance program twice. However, I feel great from kratom every day when I take it, three times a day... Every fucking day. It completely eradicates any sort of cravings I have. Kratom is a thousand times more effective than subs. You should think about switching completely. 




 Get looped on kratom? Pfft. Let me know when you find it. 




 There's a shit storm brewin
