 Title = misleading 




 They can take control of your character? Here comes the hackers forcing us to F11 ourselves. 




 **How often do you visit and participate on this subreddit? Are there any factors that would affect your participation?**

Answer: I am quite new to the Day Z subreddit, but during the day I will take a quick look at the subreddit, but then at one point in the day I will look through most of the day's new posts, and see if there are any new "Hot" ones.

**Is there anything on the subreddit would you like to be involved with in particular? Contests and events? Weekly thread maintenance? Helping style the CSS? Other?**

   Answer: I am quite familiar with Cascading Style Sheet, so of course I would appreciate helping out with the      styling of the subreddit. It would also be my pleasure to help out with the weekly thread maintenance.

**Are there any concerns with the subreddit right now that you would tackle as a Moderator? What are they, and how would you go about addressing them?**

   Answer: One of my main concerns for the subreddit right now, would be the amount of content surronding the hackers of DayZ and how so many people in the subreddit spend most of their time complaining about them. I would like to keep the subreddit mostly positive and focus on the good things about DayZ and it's development.

**Do you have any new suggestions for current moderation standards, new weekly threads, or other improvements? Yes or no will suffice here, we're not here to steal your ideas (unless you want to share them anyway, that's cool too)!**

   Answer: Twitter updates from the developers is one of the most important updates that are released on the subreddit because that is our main source of information, so I would suggest moderators keep a close eye upon the twitter feed of the developers.

**Despite best intentions and efforts, there will always be users who will criticize your actions, make false accusations, or otherwise put you down. How have you dealt with discontent, disapproval, or disagreement in the past, and how are you prepared to handle this criticism in a position of power?**

   Answer: Criticism is a standard within the gaming community, most of us deal with it everyday, to me it has no negative effect, sometimes criticism can make us more open minded, and appreciate other people's opinions more than before, when I have dealt with criticism I try and stay positive with it, although most of the time within gaming criticism is an attempt to put other gamers down. I am prepared to handle criticism without responding with criticism, so not to feed the person.

**Why do you want to be a Moderator?**

   Answer: I want to be a moderator because the Day Z subreddit is a fantastic community where users can share their opinions and creativity. So I would love to let the creativity continue, and make it easy for DayZ players to share their screenshots, recordings, ect.

**Do you have any prior moderation experience on reddit?**

   Answer: I have had no past experience with moderation on reddit.

**When did you join r/DayZ? What is your in-game experience like?**

   Answer: About a week ago, my first post received criticism upon the fact many people believed I used MS paint to stretch out my image to attempt to make the aspect ratio seems like 16:9 but the community has been welcoming else where. My gaming experience within Day Z so far has been trying to help other players, but always being blind sided by them players.

Thank you for reading this application.
 




 I think I know the solution; Run really fast into a wall with your arm pointing at it. Either you will fix the arm, or it will provide you with extreme pain. Good luck. 




 They are so blind. 




 I think Hackers target small pop servers because then they can get to everyone within the server. 




 Hacking is already occuring in H1Z1? I might go read their subreddit for all of the people posting "Er mah gerd, hacker in server". 




 Sometimes you just have to let go of your AKM. 




 People just don't learn. 




 Bye. 




 Did you know that Day Z isn't the only game that has hackers within it? Did you know that nearly every single game can be hacked using C++?
Did you know whining on the subreddit won't get hackers stopped anytime soon? How about you write some code that can stop hackers, send it to the developers and leave a little "Your Welcome" note with it. GG no re.  




 I wasn't facing North, I simply just took a picture because I was on the way to meet up with some people I know.  














 "I'm an artist because I can make a computer add 2 numbers" 




 Someone went on a duping rampage in Cherno... 




 I don't think that it should be a mask, print those designs on to balaclavas. 









 You forgot one: no servers 




 I have a feeling that the streamer was dominating all other players in the server with those airdrops. 
























 There is plenty of people who would give people one on one support like AceCool. 




 A lot of people in Australia would be on Free TV, that is where you can find this Television channel I am talking about. If you go to One (Name of the channel) if you go up one (to SBS radio) then up again. You get to see a channel that has a moderate amount of static, there is no shows being broadcasted just a Windows Vista looking desktop, with russian words in all 4 corners. There is a program open, may be Task Manager due to it saying "Processes" in the program, but the reason it is strange to me, is that there is an error.  




 DayZ is a "survival" game, I don't think it would help it to stay as survival if there was airdrops
 




 Yes, the helicopter will land, but only my Character will eject from the helicopter. 




 Make a link post. I wouldn't consider it lucky because some of the gear may be impossible to get. 




 Ok I sent you a Skype Contact Request. 




 I am new to creating missions for ARMA II using the editor and I am creating a small scale mission. I am trying to make an insertion in a blackhawk, except when it lands, it only ejects me and not the rest of my squad. The squad is grouped to the player, but the player isn't grouped to the chopper. 




 Playermodels? If so make sure you have FastDL for the server. 




 *Admin bans them* 




 Really? Making people pay to learn Garry's Mod LUA? Why would anyone pay for this when people like cosmicseagull makes tutorials that are free on youtube. 




 Don't even try to hack. Use money printers in the server, put them underground and somewhere no one will hear it or see it. 




 What "stuff" are you stuck on? 




 Driving threw Cherno in a V3S isn't counted as "running" through the town. 




 First actual good use of that quote. 




 Game would probably still be broken by then, how about 3 years? 




 3 or 4 I am not really sure. 




 No GPS, 1/10 




 Bondage Fetish. 




 One quick question. Why are you wearing a school girl dress? 




 Go on a heli run around Green Mountain, that's where you will find an M4 or an AUG. 
























 Two very different characters. 




 As the title states, I believe someone should make a subreddit where users who have been killed by hackers on a server can go make a Text Post and request for a person to come and try and kill the hacker. 




 Kind of makes farming seem pointless. 




 I remember my least favourite encounter with a hacker in DayZ, I was running along, SKS on my back, suddenly, in the corner I see "I have emptied my SKS" then my character opens a pipsi and drinks it, just a as a really cool bandit looking character appeared and headshotted me with his fully customized M4. *I hate hackers* 




 Just join another server if you see this. 




 I don't believe this is your first adventure. 




 You may give away your position if you like hiding, because apparently eating human meat is funny. 




 "Nothing in DayZ is forever" -FrankieOnPCin1080p 2012 




 Nope. They don't say what GPU it has. 




 This is so true, when admin Logs come out admins will check who killed them, then ban their killer. 




 Probably just a duper wanting to get his friends some AK's. 




 *Well fuck physics* 




 Instead of dragging it when you can see it on the left, double click it and it moves it to the first available slot that the item can fit into. 




 I am about 99% Admin Logs aren't out yet. 




 Do I replace the X's in the code? 




 Same here, except DayZ has more towns, so it is a little different. 




 Also while along the coast you can use train tracks. 




 Did you also get cancer from that? 




 Oh jesus, you obviously don't have the upperhand in a gunfight. 




 Which part? *All of it* 
























 *Gets banned for not having BattIEye* 




 This is probably one of the best DayZ encounters I have ever watched. Subscribed. 




 What country is the server hosted in?

 "More hacking content" You're one of those people who think Frankie hacks, it's just set up. 




 I caught like one of them on there. He failed to kill me though. 









 R.I.P Good Content 




 Should of made a link post with both images included. 




 That is why I play Private Hives, no Character Wipes on there. ;) 




 "No reason" lol, welcome to DayZ. 




 Stereotypes. Anyone who wears a balaclava = bandit. Quite sad really. 




 That FOV gave me a headache. *Literally* 




 I just wanted to start a little discussion here since the subreddit has been really inactive lately. Seems like no one wants to post content. 




 Russains.

*Friendly Russains* 




 They modelled a nearly naked zombie? 




 I thought you were OP. Sorry. 




 Your graphics make the game seem blurry. 




 No your graphic settings. 
























 I am quite new to Unity and I am creating a test 3d game. I am trying to use a texture I created but I realised Texture-Tiling is global. So I started importing the texture multiple times to change the amount of tiling. Is there a better way to do this?  




 I have a question, is this on an Australian server? 




 Can you give us more detail? 




 I almost killed myself while reading this. 









 *Complains about someone killing him when he drew his weapon first* 




 No, gas is for my V3S Submarine. 




 Give the recorder to someone else. So that person will hold on to it, and it won't come back. 




 They don't have a publisher, that's why they go to Kickstarter asking for money. 




 I guess, I mean if someone like EA were making this, I would believe it would come out. 




 Why's that? 




 *Too bad when the game comes out December 2016* 




 Any help would be appreciated. 




 That's the point of this picture, It's a TV Channel you can watch from all around of Australia I believe. it just displays a Windows Vista desktop. Too me it seems really creepy, mainly because of the static. 




 I am really confused about that comment too. Care to explain soggywaffles? Also yeah RecentIdiocy he is talking about Far Cry 4 at the beginning of the game you wait 10-15 minutes and the main antagonist comes back and finishes the game.  




 TV = "Television" 




 Any examples on when this happened? Just curios. 




 No one realised how weird that clothing combination is? A Ghillie Headwrap combined with a pink school girl dress. *Sexy* 




 Did it make you cry too? 




 Pretty sure that was The Purge. 
























 Simple luck. I haven't found one in ages, used to find so many. 




 "I don't think he can see us, push me over man" 




 They don't understand the FPS:Entities ratio. 




 Sound Bug 




 Zombies walk though doors/walls heaps for me. 




 Not really relevant. Post this to the Dxtory subreddit. 




 But the coast is where you will find all the friendly freshies, because sceaming friendly gets you a one way ticket to the coast. 




 The first two questions have a simple answer: The ARMA II engine. Base building will never be like that, because of a simple thing... Leg breaking. 




 I want that feature so badly. 




 In the video you see it dosen't stick to the ground, it just floats at bits, so it would do that. Or it would just not let you place it there at all. 




 I wish we could get bipods for some weapons, and we could move furniture to where we want, I would have a big table near a window with a gun with a bipod set up, so if I need to I could go and snipe some guys. 




 I wish people would read what it says when you hover your mouse over the downvote button... 




 I would choose a house, put cans in the kitchen, if you could open the fridge and close it, that's where all of my cans and canteens would be. I would have a room in the back of the house for my Armory. Also of course I would have a room where there is a bed and in the closet I would have multiple types of clothes such as: Hunting Clothes, Ghillie suits for scouting, etc.  




 Can you imagine how cool people could make screenshots? 




 And we're only in 0.53, there seems like there is so much to come. 




 I really wish we could board up houses. That would make me play DayZ 24/7. 




 This could mean they are working on Base Building! 




 *The feels* 




 Please leave it in Devs. 




 Throw away your current phone, take out the SIM card, squash/break it. Buy a new one, get a new SIM. Move FAR AWAY. It is not the best outcome, but it is the safest. 
























 Maybe he was trying to signal Batman? 




 He might want to watch out for those bandits on the other hill.  














 I was a little disappointed that you can only see the figure properly from a map, although it was pretty interesting how someone could miss this completely if they were playing without aid from a map. 



















 I would like it if they kept their new scripting language private, so that only they know about it = less scripters 




 Well they're trying to make loot spawns realistic, and pretty much the only past-time in prison, was to read. 




 Did you search the rooms at the end of the hall, on the second and third levels of the  prison block. That is quite a good food spawn. 




 Haven't broken my legs once at the prison. I have had my legs broken numerous times elsewhere. 




 I don't play Persistence because of the broken loot spawns. 




 I found a MP5 in that really small room at the end of one of the halls. 




 Haven't broken my legs even once. 




 Probably not. 




 Don't you mean broken? 




 I thought it was a Train or a Submarine. 




 You can't exactly *fix* hacking in a game. There will always be hackers because there is always a way for hackers, to hack. 




 Wait, the V3S *isnt* a submarine?  
























  When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east.

This line was best in Game Of Thrones 




 Game of Thrones RP 




 You are very new if you can not tell that this is not Balota... 




 That is a really great idea. Another cool feature of that, would be not only a logbook of your player, but of your character. So that every time you die, that log book would be reset. It would also be really awesome if you could read other character's log book after killing them. 




 **A Way for Fitting Weapons into Your Backpack**

 nbsp;

Storing Weapons in your backpack can be a real big hassle due to the only way of storing it in there, is sideways. Although, if most of us were to store a weapon in a backpack in real life, we would do it facing up, right? So why not do that in DayZ. Make weapons take up the same amount of space, but let them face upwards. I thought of this because most weapons can not be stored in backpacks as the backpack's space in the inventory does not have a big enough width.

 nbsp;

Thank you to anyone who reads this, and have a great day! 




 There is also quite an extreme amount of posts regarding 'Hackers', I believe there should just be a PSA that is stickied so that users know about the situation. 




 Do you have anything in the 'filter' 




 That is the same as me. I play quite a lot of DayZ on medium pop servers (Australian). The one I saw (Actually I did not see them, because they were in the Camo building wall glitch) my friends ran in to try and secure it, because we had a farming hoe. Then suddenly one of them loses their gear, then they get carpet bombed. Luckily I was on the hill outside. This happened at Veresnik. 




 Agreed. Although the problem with night time in DayZ and the way people use it, saddens me. It is night time it is supposed to be dark, why maximise your gamma for extra visibility? They add the gas-lantern, torch and chemlight for a reason. 




 I also want the Developers to focus on the multi-player and optimizing, but we probably will not see much optimizing until the final version. 




 Admins doing this would be way cooler. 




 It would be great if the admins also challenged the players, such as the admins being the heroes/bandits protecting the objective. 




 That would add a terrifying atmosphere to the game. Just imagine, your character looks at his watch (Please add devs) he sees the clock strike some time like (2:13 AM or 1:43AM) some time when it's dark. A gunshot is heard from out of nowhere, then a group of Bandits are running at you. 




 There would not be a linear story. You could side with Bandits and Heroes, maybe they would both have the same objective, but they would get there different ways. If eventually the devs let us learn their new scripting language and let us build custom mods for SA, I will learn and make this. You wouldn't even need to do the quests, you could just kill everyone and rule the land. 




 No, the bandits and heroes would be AI.  




 Of course. The objectives would be difficult and time consuming because you would get an approximate location of the items you are looking for, and those areas would be flooded with zombies or bandits/heroes. 




 "Singe player would be boring" That is an opinion. You wouldn't be forced to play Single player, it would only be a feature available within the game. 




 I didn't say that they would completely remove Multi-player. It would be an additional mode, where you get a single player character. This character wouldn't be available for use in Multi-player servers. 









 So after 140 hours of playing the Standalone, I still do not know how to solve this very simple problem. Whenever I am in the North West. (A lot of the time) I have this problem where my character is hungry and/or thirsty, yet my character is stuffed, this makes it difficult to keep energized and Hydrated. Any help is appreciated.
