 There's a remote sensing lab in Russell? I feel like I should have known that. 









 Don't get me wrong, bees are expensive and any responsible grower would not use a practice that seriously and quickly harms the bees. But if a grower is getting hammered by a pest right at time of pollination there are tricks to get around injuring the bees. 




 Bees are also diurnal. Crops that require herbivore insect rpotection during fowering can be sprayed at night when the bees are holed up in thier hive. 




 Not quite. It's more like gnats can get through a screen that will stop mosquitoes. 




 Oh! And try not to muck up the teflon tape around the threads of the nozzle head. Although it's easy enough to replace if you do.  




 Looks like it! Although, now that it's been used it is filled with plastic. That glues it in place. That makes unscrewing it a huge pain. What I've done in tha past was to turn the heat on to melt that plastic, then quickly unscrew it with a small crescent wrench. Be really careful or wear thin gloves. Extruders get crazy hot.

If you can figure out another way to get it off go for it. I'd also like to know.  




 A bb gun doesn't have the umpf needed to get DNA-coated gold nanoparticles into cells. The original gene gun was a .22. Also, HEPA air purifiers are useless for this kind of thing. They don't come close to removing enough contaiminants and they do not direct air in a laminar flow. A real flow hood filter is about 6 inches thick.

If you want a real hood, try searching for those used by mushroom cultivators. They run at least $400 and up. 




 Maybe, I've never tried it. You could easily strip your filament doing that but that's not a big problem. 




 It essentially has to do with the arrangment and behavior of electrons in materials. Depending on the energy of a photon (or wavelength, they are related), it changes how the electron(s) react or if they react. For instance, microwaves tend to make atoms or molecules rotate, this heats water up. The same home microwave does nothing at all to dry ice (frozen CO2) because the bonds in the molecule are different lengths. 

But! There are materials that are transparent to visible light, like glass. But again, long infrared cannot penetrate glass well but can penetrate crystals of some salts (including table salt).  




 It sounds like you may have a plugged nozzle. It happens to the best of us. Try soaking the tip in acetone if it was an ABS print. For PLA, try boiling the nozzle in water and reaming the tip with a fine needle.  




 Carbohydrate and fats, primarily. I ran the math once for a biochem class. All that water is formed at the end of the electron transport chain. 




 In fact, an average adult produces about a liter of water a day from this source. 




 About a year ago we one of our's found two VHS tapes of porn on a railroad track. Trail treasure is in the eye of the beer holder. 




 I replaced the infrared filter in a canon powershot with a infrablue filter from [infragram (public labs).](http://infragram.org/). It's a near infrared because the CCD is not designed to detect the lower energy infrared light. Essentially because of the [photoelectric effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect). It's not a thermal imaging camera because again it was not designed to detect those faint signals.

The reason I converted the camera is because I'm a grad student in plant pathology. This summer I plan to try to do some remote detecting of plant health in Ag fields. Chlorophyll (like the pine in the photo) show up as very bright in infrared and very dim in blue light. The opposite is true for plants low in chlorophyll. Using both can map general plant health.

Oh, and I processed it in [Fiji](http://fiji.sc/Fiji) using a [plugin](https://github.com/nedhorning/PhotoMonitoringPlugin/tree/master/downloads) for this kind of photo.

Fun stuff. Can't wait 'til summer. 

Edit: Added the processing info. 














 What's a phone book? 




 No known trees are older than about 9,000 years. There may be or may have been trees this old but none are known to science. 




 [Corers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phd-du6DW1A) can be used to get a small cylinder of wood going through the tree. These are then glued to a larger piece of wood and scanned into a computer. The software will straighten the curved rings and align them to a preestablished tree ring library for dating.

Interestingy, since trees of a species in an area will grow similarly each year. If a tree dies but does not decay, those ring widths can be aligned going back farther than any of the trees are alive. This is called [dendrochronology.] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrochronology) The current maximum for this method is around 11,000 years, even though none of the trees are that old.  









 This gets a little complicated. A common method is called [Isochron.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochron_dating)

Essentially, an igneous rock will contain a handful of different specific minerals. Think granite. In any mineral solidifying from the source, two different isotopes of, say, strontium, will be incorporated at a constant proportion. The isotopes of Strontium 86 and 87 react chemically identically. In this way, initial proportion becomes fixed in all minerals within a given rock. This is like how blue m m's and green m m's taste the same, but are a little different.

Rubidium and strontium will act chemically different. A mineral may contain more or less of each and that ratio will change mineral to mineral within a rock. Green m m's and green skittles do not taste the same. 

Rubidium 87 decays to strontium 87 over time. At the initial formation, the Sr 87/86 ratio was fixed. As Rb 87 changes to Sr 87, and as initial Rb 87 varied in the minerals, the proportion of Sr87/86 will change AND change differently for each mineral within a rock. This can be [plotted](http://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/images/rb_sr_isochron.jpg) to project an age to a volcanic rock.

What's notable, is that initial concentration of parent isotope doesn't need to be know. However, it can be calculated after the fact.

 Eva Green is the name of the BioRad PCR reagent we use. 




 No.

 Yes, as you vaporize your gas would create a momentary buffer for your space ship.

 If Binge drinking 5 or more drinks, and the "bottle" is the unit of wine, does that mean I can drink 4 bottles of wine in a sitting without binging? 




 A catalyst stabliizes the intermediate molecule. You can think that in the process of the beginning products going to the ending products, this is a middle point where they are all together and it's some combination of bonds. Even "half bonds". This step is the unstable step. It takes a lot of energy to hold it in this step.

A catalyst, will take the two starting products, and stablize the half-bonded middle step. Then it could either slide back to start, or slide down to the lower energy end products.

All this essentially means it lower the barrier of the activation engery, allowing the reaction to more easily move to end point.

[A graph of above.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Catalyst_effect.png) 




 If it's coming from all directions, the light receptors wouldn't meaure a difference between any two directions, so it would act like normal and grow upward due to gravity. 




 Oh damn! You are right! I knew I fixed that decimal the wrong direction. 




 There's no need to guess. It can be calculated. 




 Also, for reference, if the Earth was the size of a basball the moon would be about 7.5 feet away and the Milky way would be 3.4 billion miles wide.

Space is big. 




 Fun Question. So, The Milky way is about 100,000 light years in diameter. Andromeda is about 2.5 million light years away. So, Andromeda is about 25 time farther away than the milkyway is wide.

A baseball is 7.3cm in diameter. 7.3cm * 25 = 1.825 meters or about 6 feet.

Space is big.

Edit: misplaced a decimal. And Again 




 Yes, it's about that simple. Two things you might want to know though. Many plants (Magnolias included) prefer to be cross-pollinated, as in, pollen from one plant fertillizing the flower of a different plant. It's more robust on a genetic level for the species. You can self-pollinate (essentially inbreeding). It will work for Magnolias, but you may get a lower seed set than if you had another tree around.

The second is that some plants, to encouage outcrossing, mature the pollen and the stigma (the receptive female part of the flower) at different times. I don't think this happens in Magnolias, but to be safe try several flowers at once.

Good luck! 




 Yep, it will work. It's best when you can see the pollen grains starting to fall out of the stamens, just like in your photo. Fun fact: Magnolias are a very anceint lineage of flowering plants. They pollinated by beetles because when Magnolias evolved, bees were millions of years in the future. 




 It looks much more like an opportunistic infection. In other words, it moved in after the damage was done. Could you take a closer photo? As close as you can make it clear. 









 I'm a plant path grad student. I love it. I like biological interactions. It's a field (like much of biology) where you can spend your time in fields or forests or in the lab running constant PCR. 




 Looks like a Ganoderma. Likely Ganoderma tsugae. Nice shot! 




 Most of the time, no. If you compress it AND drop the temperature, then yes, almost all gases will form a solid at some point.

The reason a thing is a gas is becuase it has enough energy to overcome the molecules attraction to one another. This attraction is fairly weak for things that are gases at room temperature (hence why they are gases). If you take many gases and compress them, but keep the temperature around 70F (25C), they will form a [superfluid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfluidity). Superfluidity is a special and weird and very cool form of matter.  




 They also have 8 sets of chromosomes (Octoploidy) and most cultivated ones are hybrids between two continents. And are delicious. 
























 Nope. Not an oak anyway. Grafting only works between closely related groups. Usually the "family" designation is the bounary. If you look at the website you provide, you'll see that the fruits group together by how they are related. 




 Find one. Just one. 




 Of course, we can now isolate genes so they don't spread in the pollen (by inserting into the chloroplast genome). No one yet has because the cost of deregulating a single transgenic event is about $100 million. So, due to unscientific review processes, we're all stuck with the old technology because the incremental increase in prfit doesn't offset the investment. It's also the same reason you don't see start-ups breaking into this market. 




 That's actually not true. Yes, genes can move through pollen, but Monsanto has never actually brought suit to farmers with accidental gene trasmission. Most people are familiar with [this suit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto_Canada_Inc._v._Schmeiser) but remember it as Monsanto crushing some farmer. In reality, the defendant violated Canadian patent law by intentionally growing the protected seeds.

I challenge anyone to find a case where Monsanto actually sued a farmer for accidental contamination. And don't just find some crappy blog. Find court documents supporting your position. 









 I'll be honest, the ID was just based on growth habit on a norway maple. It's a relatively new disease in the United States. Somewhere, there exists some dichotomous keys. They usually rely on the shape of appendages on the chasmothecia and the number of asci and spores. You'd have to google around.

If you find scenescent leaves infect with mildew you may find the small black stuctures. I did a wet mount with those. Then with the end of a pen or probe, you can press on the cover slip until it cracks. You can usualy hear it crack. As water moves in the asci swell and poke out.

It's fun. 




 I study plant pathology, so I love it. They are one of my favorites. 














 I'll be there. Whoo! 




 There are occasional "Full Moon Runs", usually in the summer. Keep an eye on the website for when those are. It's also somewhat unwise to set a run before you've done a few. Sorry dude. 




 Respiration of 1 gram of fat (plus O2) gives about 1.1 grams of water (plus CO2). 




 Well, the core started hot from the materials condensing into a planet and rock insulates pretty well but that's only part of it.

Radioactive decay is the rest. This continually releases energy within the earth, keeping it hot. On the upshot, this is also where the helium comes from.

Yes, it can eventually run out and solidfy. This is what happened to Mars. Mars, being a little smaller, has a greater surface area to volume than the Earth and cooled faster. 




 First: Not a race, you racist.

J/k, Taking a guess based on the hares (the people setting the trail) and that fact that it's March Madness, it is probably a start of a Saturday. However, there is a strong chance of drinking at bars until 2. That happens kind of a lot. Some hashes are all night or even all weekend affairs. 




 Well?? 




 Because I have shit to do and "tin" is some number fewer syllables. 




 Sometimes fails look really neat. 




 Yep, and for all ages. Just have a sense of humor and don't wear nice clothes (it's not always on roads). I am trying to get over my hangover from yesterday's run. There was something with apple cider and everclear. I have a headache. It was a good time. 




 Cool story bro. 




 It's called ice. You can't drink ice, but once pretreated properly it becomes ingestable. 




 The first and formost reason is speed. If it takes about 5 years to go from seed to a fruiting tree then during the career of a plant breeder they may only be able to do 6 or 8 generations, at best. As compared to something like beets or beans, where you might get 2 generations a year, progress is slow.

The second reason is mangos act a bit like apples. Apples do not "come true to seed" and neither do mangos. Each tree that comes from one seed has a huge degree of variability which makes it hard to breed for any particular trait. Any worthwhile apple tree that, partly by luck,  happens to have good qualities is propagated by grafting (a form of cloning). The same is true for good quality mango trees.

Third is economic. It's sad, but the rich countries either haven't cared about mangos or don't grow mangos, or both. This is true for a lot of crops and as government funding asymtotically approaches zero, most crop breeding is focused around crops companies can make a living selling.

Fourth, is that no one likes GMOs. Making a safe, seedless mango is close to trivial using modern techniques. It could be made in the same way the seedless grapes, watermelons, and bananas have been made all of which are clearly safe. But! No one likes a GMO, so we're stuck with seeded Mangos and a whole pile of other foods that might be made better. My wish is tearless onions, but hey, not 'til education is fixed.



  




 That's usually only a temporary condition.

 This looks like you are washing out the chlorophyll. If you boil leaves in ethanol the chlorophyll is removed but reds and yellows (anthocyanin and xanthophylls, respectively) remain. 









 I have a slightly shady site too. Peas burn out before they do much. Tomatoes just get leggy and by the time I had any last year they were cheap at the farmers' market. Kale and spinach do much better.

If you want to play it lazy, you could wait for the Farmers' Market to start up. There are transplants there the first several weeks. They are growing those plants for this climate and you could ask about lighting conditions. I usually get a few there to fill out my space.

Good luck! 




 Pick something that's not fro a plant. Even animal products are made from plants. Steel is smelted with coal made from plants. Half of pharmacedicals are plant derived inlcuding morphine, quinine, and the hormones in birth control (from a yam (not a sweet potato), FYI). Many pesticides are also derived from plants. I'm wearing trichomes (cotton) and just ate breakfast, all of which were plants.

How about [bioremediation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioremediation)?

Or [Nitrogen fixation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation) that accounts for half of the nitrogen in your body.

Or how about mythology? How many poems reference the beauty of a flower? There are people whose whole job is to grow plants, not for food, that make areas more asthetically pleasing.

Or soil erosion control, peat smoked scotch, [plastics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polylactic_acid), biodesil, [solvents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turpentine), perfumes, coffee, [pigments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigo), and [poison.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates)

All of the above ignores wood products...

I like plants.
 




 You know, you could probably do better than chance by just knowing age. 









 It's a Dracaena. Maybe Dracaena fragrans? It looks a little low on light. Try cutting the stalk so it braches down where the light shines through the window.

Also, if the tap water is hard in your area, then it might be in need of a repotting. Hard water will build up salt deposits in the soil of house plants and choke them out. If you see white material on the soil surface, this is likely your problem. Repot and water with demineralized water (distilled, bottled drinking water) at least occasionally. 

Only do one of the above at once. 




 I mean, that's a weird pasttime, even for Austrian scientists. 




 Plants like this are why herbicides were invented. Or you learn to love it. 




 You are aware this has nothing to do with religion, right? It fits your world view, but let's be honest, this is a story about untreated mental illness. No, I don't mean religion.

 Well, yeah, it's hard to grow a lot of it and you don't get much. However, if I'm guessing you're like me, being efficient isn't the point. The point is doing it yourself and having fun. So...

The Saffron Crocus is sterile (due to polyploidy, it's 3n); no seeds. So you can only get more bulbs from vegetative bulb division. If you get a bulb, it will slowly grow into more bulbs over time. I bought one bulb about 4 years ago and I'm up to 5. Sorry, but I'm not willing to part with any of them yet. Check [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_sacat=0 _nkw=saffron+bulbs _frs=1) in the spring and fall. They aren't too expensive.

They are mostly grown in a Mediterranean climate and require full sun. They are short-day plants and require a specific amount of dark to flower in the fall. [Check the Bible for more culture specifics.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron#Cultivation) Good luck!

Edit: clarity 




 I'll give you 10 to 1 she's never read the bible. 




 I would pick and toss (trash not compost) any affected leaves before planting. Then just be vigilant.

Transplants tend to be packed tightly into greenhouses for propagation. These can be hot spots for disease propagation, too. As long as your plants are not as closely packed, and you watch for problems developing, you should be OK. 




 It's called Alternaria solani, or the causal agent of Early Blight. The angular bull's-eye shape is a classic feature. Nice photo.

Do a good clean-up in the fall to control it. But if you live somewhere humid, or your plants are very close together, it can defoliate tomatoes and potatoes. Copper fungicides are another control for the home-grower.

Good luck! 




 What are your qualifications? 




 The viruses don't replicate in this case. They are only the viral shell filled with a sequence we wanted. Viral shells (capsids) are really good at injecting nucleic acids into cells. No replication.  




 This is really cool stuff. This technique could be used for all kinds of single gene diseases. Permanent cures for some kinds of deafness, color blindness, and cystic fibrosis, among others.

Another related tool could be fight specific, tenacious diseases. If you can make a worthwhile antibody in the lab that targets a conversed antigen of flu or malaria, then transvect that into a host B-cell after chromosomal rearrangement. 

Why aren't we funding science more!?!! 




 Fun fact, if astrology types actually looked at the sky the whole thing would fall apart. There's a 13th (Ophiuchus) because the stars have moved since the time of the Babylonians.

The planet or sun or whatever isn't even in the claimed constellation a bunch of the time.

I don't expect people to re-evaluate world views to often, but if the stars control everything, look up once in a while! 




 There is a box of donuts in the break room on the 17th floor of Van Hise every Friday morning. Play it like you are suppose to be there, grab a donut, and punch the elevator back down. I've done this a few hangover days.

 I took it my senior year as a relax class. Holy crap. So good. Really a dynamic lecturer. He's a science story teller. 




 The Bruce Company is solid.

Avoid municipal mulches as they tend to be made from trees around town that have died. Many are maples dead from Verticillium wilt, a disease caused by a fungus. It can easily survive for a year or two and has a wide host range, i.e. it could kill your plants too. 




 This isn't a joke; it's a legitimate question. This fact has implications for relativity and the fabric of the Universe. 




 I liked [this](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/01/29/268422490/episode-513-dear-economist-i-need-a-date) a lot.

Gymnosporangium rust. This is the telial stage which makes telialspores, which make basidiospores, which infect apples/quince/hawthorn. There are three species and they all looks really similar. They call it cedar-apple rust because you see it on junipers. 


































 Were they ashes by chance? 




 3 Might be an Astilbe

9 Is a rhododendron, depending on where you live it might be ok (they are evergreen and never look hot right after thaw).

 I bought a home hood about 8 months before returning to grad school. Since then I've been using the super academic hood. Essentially zero contams with the vigorous edible fungi, even when filling culture syringes. It sucks, but this is a rare case where more money actually equals better performance.

Pro tip: Quit your job and go back to school. Contam free. But bills. Lots of bills. 




 But hey! As a first world citizen that ate three meals today, I declare the rest of the world should not grow GMOs. Even if that means not enough food to go around...


A few companies in control of any commodity is something to keep an eye on, but this is a bigger issue. It is a moral failing to not allow reasonable deployment of GMOs. The world has a lot of people. Too many went to bed hungry tonight. These shitheads stand in the way of a partial solution.

 Eh, personal experience. Skaters, more than even pedestrians, seem to have no awareness of their surroundings. Just about three hours ago I almost hit a dude on a board since he was going the wrong way down state and not looking.

On a bike, Peds have right-of-way in all cases except at a controlled intersection. Skaters don't have the same right-of-way.

I'd be pissed if there was a soccer game in the street everyday too. It would impinge on others' fair use of the street. 




   There is lots of nice concrete, no cars, and even a skate store right there.

So skate culture is oblivious to the mixed-use nature of State? All the Pedestrians, bicyclists, cabs, and buses don't use that street at all. But hey! It's not like it's illegal... 




 Haha, if someone left a bike out all winter, I don't think ideal pressure is on the radar. 




 Is skate culture a thing? 









 No. I actually said that to a biker this morning.

I was also on a bike, but following the law.

 I think it's very funny when people do find it important. There's actually a 13th now, Ophiuchus, because the stars have moved since the Babylonians. Astrologists would know this if they ever looked up. Seriously, if you think the stars contain your fate, look the fuck up once in a while!

 Oh, and most of that pollen is pine pollen. Pine pollen has those two lobes that make it look a bit like mickey mouse. 




 Not pollen. You have some trichomes (pronounced "try-combs"), or, "plant hairs". They are widely varying in shape, size, and function. Pollen will only grow one tube and doesn't branch. Google "EM of trichomes" to see how narly they can be and avoid some of the weed photos. (In the case of cannabis, the trichomes are glandular and produce the psychoactive oil.) 




 Neat photos. Those do look like roots. It almost looks like *Agrobacterium rhizogenes*. That's a bacterium that infects plants and injects DNA into cells. In this case, the cells go a bit rouge and make a bunch of roots. The disease is called "crazy root". No real treatment.

 Is Dick Despommier a nice guy? He seems like a nice guy. 





























 Also, I'd bet $50 you live in the midwest or the northwest.  




 That's [apple scab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_scab), caused by *Venturia inaequalis*. The tree is something in the apple family. Probably a crap apple.

Clean up all the leaves in the fall and burn them or give them to the city. Additionally you can spray a copper fungicide just before the leaves fall in autumn and spread a nitrogen fertilizer to help the leaves degrade.

I knew that degree would come in handy. Who wants a date?! 




 That looks like exactly like almost all HAM sites, too.

 It might be useful for something. Rhino horn made the Western Black rhino go extinct. And herbal "remedies" occasionally cause liver or kidney toxicity.

See!! Plenty of legit uses.

 How did you make it? Did you print a mould and cast it? Or make a negative mould from a print? 




 Fortune cookies and clams. Com'on guys. 




 Hmm, maybe violent drug cartels should get into brewing to diversify what they sell to Americans. 




 Gross. Did it work? 




 Ha! Wasn't that nuts? It was at least knee deep. I biked through it. It was fun, but I'll regret it when my downtube rusts out next month. 




 This is one of my favorite flowers! It won't grow where I am... 




 Haha, next time don't use The HufPo as a source. Does coffee prevent cancer too?!?! 




  

Is that really an interrobang?
 




 Me too, 




 It took me two years and I made made mine out of aspen. It's rained maybe a week straight in the Midwest.

 How many people did that and do you do that every year? I forgot who I talked to, but I remember someone saying that over the beers at the end. 




 I'm on youtube! All I had to do was ride down State nekked. 




 It was a lot of fun. My drop-down bars were not ideal. 




 I won't argue about what you want to do, but most named commercial strawberries are clones, usually out of tissue culture. 




 Well, with strawberries, you can propagate them asexually, so it doesn't matter.

Otherwise, breeders generally consider F7 lines to be inbred. 7 generations increases the homozygosity to 99.2%. 1-1/2^7
Once inbred, plants will generally come true from seed.

If inbreeding depression is a problem with the genera you are attempting to breed, then you need to select subpopulations as opposed to single plants. Say you make a cross, then grow all the seed from that cross. Then, select maybe half the plants and interbreed them. Grow them up again, select again. Each time you'll enrich in the genes you want without (hopefully) causing too much inbreeding. The minimum plants needed to prevent inbreeding within a population also depends on the genera.

So, you've got some research to do. 




 What is your climate like? Is it possible the tree has too much or not enough water?
