 Besides airsoft I'm guessing you guys have different hobbies too, so what stuff do you guys like to do?

I like to play instruments with a small circle of friends, and we kind of have a band but it isn't anything too serious. I love to play guitar, and [I also collect guitars.] (http://i.imgur.com/5dlTnM2.jpg) 

To the left is my BC Rich Warlock. I paid about $700 for this guitar. 

To the right is my custom Jackson that a friend of the family rebuilt and repainted. This project was overall about $1000.   

Here's a [picture of my main guitar] (http://i.imgur.com/wZBJ1ja.jpg) that I play the most. It's a custom Fender Stratocaster that the same guy made custom tailored to my size, it has a scalloped neck because it's the most comfy way for me to play, and custom pickups that sound better while playing in the basement. This guitar was the most pricey at a cool $2,600. 

I also watch a shit ton of anime and play video games. 

Edit: Oopsy I also have a [drum set,] (http://i.imgur.com/VtsZo9a.jpg) but I don't play drums as much anymore. Usually I just teach my friend who plays the beats or what he needs to play. 

Wait what's that white part in the edge of the shot? Well we put a [black light] (http://i.imgur.com/bVMqn9A.jpg) above the drums for shits and giggles, then the white part is a [poster] (http://i.imgur.com/yLc842c.jpg) from an old school project. Put them together and you get something [kind of ominous.] (http://i.imgur.com/32HCzoD.jpg) Thought I'd throw this in because I thought it was funny.  




 I was just wondering what would happen if I put a few packages of 8x10 printer paper in my dishwasher. This got me thinking of intrusive thoughts. 

You guys got any good ones?  




 Is it just me or have the past few days been an ocean of self posts? 

I guess I can't complain because I just asked a question, but I don't flood the place with questions. 

I also made a few water puns in there, so if you sea what I did I'll be on my wave.  




 I've looked high and low on YouTube and forums for reviews of this gun, and I haven't turned up with much. I read a good review from Booligan about the gun, but otherwise I can only find reviews on the Marui Mac 10. 

Would this gun be worth getting with a few extra magazines for a bit of CQB fun, or is this gun too much of a hassle and a waste of time? Any input on the topic or other great AEP's would be great.  




 I just finished watching an anime called Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo so this is kind of a reference, but what color are you?

I think I'm orange. I am enthusiastic like yellow, and I like red. 

 




 [This is my current wallpaper and probably my favorite] (http://i.imgur.com/lUZpvyV.jpg)

[Next would be this.] (http://i.imgur.com/EvJJkaA.png) The resolution is kind of meh, but it doesn't look too bad. 

[Then this.] (http://i.imgur.com/ZFva2Cl.jpg)

As you can see all anime related, eh I don't really care. I would have one of my airsoft gun wallpaper [like this] (http://i.imgur.com/Db68anX.jpg) but I'm going to be using my laptop for school work and my school is very strict about looking at guns. I got banned from school computers for a year for being on Call of Duty Elite and building classes it's so bad. 
 




 Since it's almost 4:00 in the morning I'll count this for yesterday, but I peed in a Dr.Pepper bottle and filled it all the way up to the top. 

Your guys' achievements of the day? 




 I was just nominated by a friend, but I said no. Everyone got really upset, and I had to explain to them that I didn't care, and didn't want to get wet.  









 [Here's the image itself.] (http://i.imgur.com/0jEWYT7.jpg)

If you could make it slowly zoom in on his eyes, but with text like [this] (http://i.imgur.com/dhbi6dD.jpg) but have the text stay in the same place?

Edit: Pleeeeease? 









 This obviously isn't the case with every anime in the universe, but every one I've watched I've **loved** the opening songs. Are there any ones that suck? 




 He keeps telling me that he got "totally legit" m frames at a state fair for twenty dollars. Yeah. Right. 

But he keeps telling me he's going to wear them while we play and it pisses me off. He said he won't shoot them to test them out because he doesn't want to sacrifice his "good deal." 

To put it shortly, he's a dumb fuck who's going to go blind if I don't intervene. What do? 




 [The picture itself.] (http://i.imgur.com/kSqlAIb.jpg)

If someone here could make it vibrate, similar to [this] (http://i.imgur.com/bm7LeZr.gif) then that would be awesome. Thanks! 




 For me?

[Then] (http://i.imgur.com/l0AnGBO.jpg) and [Now.] (http://i.imgur.com/sYFX2tS.jpg)

*Cringe*
 









 I didn't want to share it with my camera guy loadout album on /r/airsoft, so I'll post a seperate album [here.] (http://imgur.com/a/T26Ny)

[Camera guy album I'm talking about] (http://imgur.com/a/HNjGu) 
























 At the end of [the .gif] (http://i.imgur.com/4EZuska.gif) it turns into a negative color scheme/filter. If someone here could just cut out that part that would be awesome. Thanks!

Edit: Sorry, where are my manners? Please..? 




 I probably don't have a favorite because I stumble on so many a day, but I'd have to say right now some of my favorites are, 

[This] (http://i.imgur.com/SJ7IuCg.gif)

[Then this] (http://i.imgur.com/pRbDVzL.gif)

[Maybe this] (http://i.imgur.com/GZzB4YT.gif)

[This] (http://i.imgur.com/yUeVFn2.gif)

[And this] (http://i.imgur.com/rcZxQb1.gif)
 




 I usually need to get rides from people to get to my shitty job. I've never liked working there, so when I couldn't get a ride tonight I said fuck it. 

This has been the first time in awhile I've felt like I was in control of what's happening to me. That job doesn't make me happy, so fuck it. It's not like they'll fire me for missing a day and not showing up. If they do, I don't care either because I hate it there.  




 I know, I know it sounds gay, ineffective, etc. but hear me out. 

I was thinking about my perfect comfortable/effective kit, and I was also thinking about solid color loadouts. Now one time with some friends we we're messing around and playing some pick up games after the day was over. At this point I had taken off my BDU pants, and put back on my usual **mens** skinny jeans (like that matters really.)

Here's the thing, they didn't really restrict my movement as much as I thought, and they were still comfy as fuck. 

Next, would be my next loadout choice, I want to try something different and do an all tan loadout. I know this won't blend well, but I don't really care. I usually push up and run anyways. The whole point of this is really, would khaki skinny jeans looks goofy with an airsoft kit? I don't think it would look that bad.  




 Since this is chat and shit I'm assuming this is allowed. 

My favorite color is orange. Style of red and enthusiasm of yellow.  




 I know that Pandora exists, but this song is from an anime so I was assuming I wouldn't be able to find anything in English with a similar style. [This is the song is any of yall are curious, I ain't ashamed.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDnB6Sjw9BM) 




 I mean I'm not going to kill myself, but Robin Williams killing himself got me thinking. I always thought it wasn't selfish, and never understood why people thought so. I just thought Robin Williams killing himself is proof that it isn't selfish, because he seemed so happy and healthy but he wasn't all along. Just proves how easy it is to put on a fake smile and pretend to be happy, I guess sometimes it's a part of the job.  




 So I got a pair of Condor Knee Pads that are very loose and I can't tighten them to my fit. I don't feel like getting out the sewing machine because, 

A. My skills are rusty.

and

B. I'm lazy and it'll look like shit because all I have is black thread (the knee pads are tan.)

So do you guys have any suggestions? I'm a small guy with small knees, and I need knee pads. I have some old Pro Tech pads from my mom because she plays roller derby and she gave me her old pads. I would use the Pro Techs but they don't look "totally uber oper8ter" enough for me. 

Edit: I'm checking out these [BLACKHAWK!] (http://www.amazon.com/BLACKHAWK-Advanced-Tactical-Knee-Pads/dp/B005GA7MWS/ref=cm_cr_pr_pb_t) ones but it sucks because I have no way of telling whether or not they'll work for small legs/knees. This is the case with all knee pads. 

 




 If someone had a nerf sword or capable melee weapon, do you think they could [deflect airsoft BB's like Kirito does with bullets in the series?] (http://i.imgur.com/oX2Ot96.gif)

I mean at certain distances you can see BB's coming just like the bullet paths in the show, so there must be a chance of it working? Just curious, it's not like I'm going to do it, just seems interesting to me.

Edit: Clarified stuff for clarity or some shit 




 I just got it again, while browsing Evike's new products today. Now I'm going to be eye balling [this] (http://www.evike.com/products/48746/) baby for awhile. I have a fuck ton of GBBR magazines piled up in my gear cabinet that I can put to use now too. 

This happen to any of you guys recently? 














 * It's my day off and I got up at 12:00 pm.

* My dad brought pizza home for dinner.

* Two of my good friends stopped over for a cup of coffee and to chat before pre-season football practice.

Turning out to be a pretty good for a rainy day!

[Part 2] (http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2ckpo8/its_been_awhile_rdepression_i_just_need_to_thank/)

**We left off with me making a channel and starting to play airsoft again**

So I got about $1000 worth of gear because I don't go anywhere or spend money. The airsoft stuff ends here because I'm starting my tour of public fields with my friend when I get my license. Otherwise back to the girl of the story,

Things didn't work out with [neckbeard] (https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/t1.0-9/10583843_830625146982733_3372155739179801587_n.jpg) and her. She almost turned to self harm, and I stayed up until five o' clock on the phone with her to calm her down. This was just mid July. We agreed to coffee and just catching up.

She told me about what happened with her and neckbeard. He insisted she dress up in public, and then he tried raping her but she beat him up. I came clean about losing my virginity, and then the unexpected happened. She started to cry. I couldn't help it either and I started to cry as well. The thing is, is that I love her, and she loved me. In the end I wish I would have lost my virginity to her.

Blah blah that's lame. We began hanging out more and by the end of July we were (and are) back together. Now it's going into August, the tenth is coming up! Now we hang out all day, and I might even ask if I can spend the night one of these days. 

Well that's the story of my struggle with depression, and how I fell in love and shit. This tenth will be the seventh month for me cut free! 
If you actually read all of this boring shit, then thanks. If not then it'll be archived and chilling out on the internet for people of the future to read.  




 **Where we left off something neckbeard guy blah blah**
[Link to previous post.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2ckofd/its_been_awhile_rdepression_i_just_need_to_thank/)

Okay continued. 

Around January I forgot to mention I got a job as a dishwasher and this comes up a bit here and there but I'll get to that in a bit. Overall it helped me make friends, and try pot for the first time! (I don't use it all the time don't worry, like once a month at most)

Around April/May I started talking to my next girlfriend a lot more. She was so cold though. She never cared about me in the slightest. I wouldn't say I fell back into depression by any means, but I felt like I had to fight for my next girlfriends attention. I was willing to do anything to make her happy, that's the only thing that hurts a little.
She wanted to have sex, and I wasn't really comfortable. At the time I was willing to do anything and if she wanted to, "Bond bodies" or some shit, whatever. That's how I lost my virginity. To be flat out I thrusted and watched It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia until she said she was done. It was terrible... 

I broke up with her after that, and it only lasted two weeks. After that I felt neglected, used, and I was on the verge of hurting. At work things were getting better at least though. I wanted to cook, and one of my dreams was to cook. I was confused, I wanted money, and I didn't care about anything at this point. This next part of my story gets darker, and I think about it a lot.

Around May/June to move up I got the main dishwasher fired. He was already slow, but still fast enough to be proficient at his job. I knew he was from the town over, and got in trouble for being in possession of marijuana all the time. I told the police department about the pot he liked to hide in his hoodie sweatshirt that he always wore. 

He wasn't at the restaurant when they came, but the police barging into the restaurant was enough to get him fired. That's how step one of my plan went into action, I was lead dishwasher, and I got bumped up from $7.50 and hour to $8.25 and hour as the lead dishwasher. The only thing I thought about was how to become a cook at that point. 

One of the main cooks was barely a year clean from smoking crack and just getting back on his feet. His name was Warren. He had a free ride to college on a hockey scholarship and he threw it away to do drugs all day. The boss's son was one of the cooks, and was already teaching me things here and there in his free time. I was absorbing the information well. I was learning how to prep and how to cook from watching and doing stuff in my spare time. 

The hardest part was getting Warren to smoke crack again. I even hung out with him and the bosses son athis place. I tricked him, and I fucked with his head a lot. He'd still talk a lot about how it made him feel, or how amazing it was. I would entice him, and I would say things like, "It's human nature to do what you want," or "Sure it's unhealthy, but you'll be thinking about smoking it for the rest of your life."

This was about the end of June. I stay up some nights thinking about it. About how I'm a "sick mother fucker" or a terrible person. I didn't care. I wanted to cook, I wanted money, and Warren was in the way. They found him buying some in an alley a few towns over, that's what my boss told me. With that the position was mine, and I was bumped up to $9.50 an hour. 

With the money I was making I decided to get back to getting my license. My test is on the 6th and I'll probably get my license. But that has nothing to do with the story, I'm just happy! I bought a car from a friend of the restaurant for $500. A '98 Monte Carlo something something, I don't know. I'm not a car guy. 

I got back into airsoft, I got more gear and money, and I started up a channel with an old pal. I think I need to continue the story to part 3 but I don't know. Here's a picture of the bracelet she made me with my airsoft gear! It's the rainbow one on my left arm. http://i.imgur.com/twpx4QL.jpg

[Part 3] (http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2ckqcd/its_been_awhile_rdepression_i_just_need_to_thank/) 




 So this is the story of how I got over my depression, and your guy's help in all of this, if you decide to read this wall of text then thanks!

It was the tenth of December, and I just turned 16 on the third. I didn't bother to get my license because I had nobody. I had a lack of friends, lack of motivation, and I just wanted to die. On the ninth I cut myself two times in the morning before school, and wore my favorite sweater to cover it up. When I got home I tried again. It felt like I had nothing more to do, and that was it. I was a hermit, and the only place I felt safe or happy was my room in the basement. I even bought a couch, and a bunch of instruments to occupy my time.

This was all on an old account, but I remember asking you guys about how to talk to people or get friends. I remember one of you said I should try talking to girls. This was weird because usually girls made fun of me and pushed me away. You guys said it would really help, and you were right! There was one person who really got me out of this, and of course you guys too :D.

I had been talking to and texting this girl from my science class for awhile beforehand, at least two months. She was really the only person who showed me genuine kindness at the time, and it felt amazing. I spiked up my hair like I like to do, put on my second favorite sweater, and got really excited. I asked her to go for a walk at her favorite place, the water tower hill. Eventually it became my favorite place to be too! She wasn't allowed to have guys over at the time so we met at the hill whenever we could. *Sorry for rambling on back to the story...*

So I remember rolling up my sleeves because it was either really hot outside, or I was nervous and really sweaty. Of course stupid me, I forgot about my cuts. When we met at the bottom of the hill she saw my cuts. I started to cry, a lot. I got embarrassed and almost ran away, that's how it always was when people saw my cuts or scars. But she grabbed my hand, it was a funny feeling and the first time I ever really held a girls hand. She told me it was okay and then she hugged me too. That was also the first genuine hug I had ever gotten (honestly my parents didn't/don't give two shits about me.)

When we got to the top of the hill, I asked her if she would think differently of me. I remember thinking, *why did I just ask?* and thought about the usual, "Well duh stupid emo" or something along those lines. No matter what I hope until the day I die, the way she smiled at me and said that it didn't matter. That it didn't change anything. That she really really liked me. I remember hugging her really really tight, and her hugging me really really tight, and it felt great. I wanted it to last forever.

The whole time we walked back to the bottom of the hill we held hands really tight. It was the first time I had smiled for more than fifteen minutes to be honest. When we got to the bottom of the hill she stopped and looked in my eyes like before. She said, "No matter what you can't never (her grammar is a little shotty at times but I think it's cute) ever hurt yourself like that again." I remember tearing up a lot, but I was still smiling. I agreed, of course I would! We hugged again and she was off to her house before her parents got mad.

The next few months we met up more and more. We talked at school **way** more than before too. She made me [this] () bracelet too so I'd, "Always be happy" and to remind me to never break our promise. Over January I met her parents, and even went bowling with them and stuff. They had excepted me, and I felt like I belonged. 

Fast forward to February, we were hanging out at her house and of course Valentines day was rolling around. It was to the point where everybody knew we had a thing, or were together. At that point we never really made it official, we just had a lot of classes together and we were always together if we could be. By the time Valentines day was upon us I asked her to go for a walk, and I asked her out at the top of the hill. (Cliche but I'm not creative so whatever lol) Then I had my first kiss! 

Over March though, things got bad. Her birthday was on the 13th, but I didn't remember it, I made an anti Semitic joke at dinner (turns out her father is Jewish), and we grew apart somehow. I felt sad, but I also didn't. As long as she was happy, and as long as we could still be friends. 

Over April she began talking to [this] (https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/t1.0-9/10583843_830625146982733_3372155739179801587_n.jpg) neckbeard guy and we all hung out together a lot. I had moved on to a different girlfriend, but things weren't the same.  
 

I think I have to make a continued post sorry. 

Edit: I FORGOT A PICTURE OF THE BRACELET D:. Oh well on the next post. 
 [Part 2] (http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2ckpo8/its_been_awhile_rdepression_i_just_need_to_thank/) 




 [So I decided to poop in a Cheezit box, yada yada. I need tips from you guys, please it's unbearable and my family is upstairs and I think they can smell it. I don't know, please.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2ck0iv/serious_pooped_in_a_cheezit_box_what_do_i_do_with/)

This is a casual conversation sub so hey why not. Right?

Edit: [:D] (http://i.imgur.com/8E3mB08.jpg) 




 I really needed to go and I had a *shitty* day so I thought it would give me a good laugh. I wiped with a sock, and it's also in the box. It smells really bad and the majority of my family is right upstairs in the family room. What do I do please help it's terrible. 

Edit: I tried pulling it out using a fly swatter like a little arm and broke open the poop and now the smell is just spreading even more please help it's in the corner of the room right now. 

Edit: The smell stopped spreading because I put a bag over it but for the time being, this is only a temporary solution.

Edit: I took it upstairs in an attempt to put it in the garage or something. My dad asked for a Cheezit, and then said, "Ah what the fuck dude did you fart?" and then I ran downstairs mumbling about moderator stuff for a subreddit. 

Edit: Someone asked for an update for his enjoyment, but this isn't really fun for me. My parents like to stay up late and I'm in a festering room of stench for at least three more hours. I put a scarf under the door so air doesn't escape. 

Edit: The bag on the box isn't blocking anything anymore. I have an old surplus gas mask but it's only been for decoration up to this point. I'm not sure if it will work. 

Edit: The mask is working a little bit, but it just smells like old books and rubber. 

Edit: My parents asked me to let the dogs outside and I'm afraid they'll figure out.

Edit: Forgot a period on the last update. 

Edit: I'm going to let the dogs out and take the box outside with me. I'll get the dog to eat it. 

Edit: Okay the dog ate the poop, but the box is still smelly. I wouldn't be able to put it in the garbage without the smell getting everyone's attention. 

Edit: What do I do with the box? My dad has a pool table and hangs out in the garage, if I put it in the garage garbage can will the smell go away by tomorrow morning? 

Edit: I took the box and put it in the street adjacent to our house. 

Edit: The sock is still in there.

 [CADPAT and tan gear, or ACU and tan gear?] (http://imgur.com/a/F31JL) 




 So a friend and I are doing a two man team sort of thing and we have our channel set up and everything. Now he already had ACU and I didn't want to make him buy a new pair of BDU's so I just got ACU camo too. I also like how it looks with tan gear so I was into the idea. 

But now I'm watching loadout videos on YouTube and gameplay and all of the poor, beginner, children, or noob loadouts include ACU gear of some kind. Did I make a mistake? [Here] (http://i.imgur.com/twpx4QL.jpg) is a picture of my current set up that I'll be running.

If it really is too bad I'll just get some Multicam BDU's for myself and then buy him some for his birthday so he doesn't have to buy any. Sure Multicam is average, but ACU is too. At least with Multicam we look a little better on the field. Right?

Edit: Fixed the picture 




 I got my new loadout a week early and don't have time to get down to the rock quarry for kit pictures so I'll just post my [head gear] (http://imgur.com/SjHnGff) for now.

**It goes as follows-**

Matrix MICH 2001

Matrix/Element Comtac II Replica

Revision Wolf Spider Goggles

Rothco Balaclava

Condor Tan Shemagh

Matrix or something half mesh mask

**The glasses are just for the picture I won't actually wear them in a game don't worry.** I didn't wear the mask in the picture because  I'm only wearing it when it's required. 

**Edit:** Formatting shit 




 So I just started watching Sword Art Online. Only the third episode and I'm crying dude. I'm already hooked to say the least. Otherwise I watch Eureka 7 and other shit. 

Edit: Just realized "animes" isn't the proper plural

Edit: 3:39 AM: Just watched Sword Art Online to episode 19 and might keep binge watching until I hear my parents wake up for work. Holy shit watch this show if you are reading this and haven't watched it. It is brilliant.  




 For me I just realized is probably waiting for new gear/guns to come to my house. Especially when it's a pricey order.  









 That is all. That made my day.  




 So I'm your average run-of-the-mill 16 year old teenage nerd dude. I just go about life right now working, and laying on the couch on Reddit. I want more, I really do, but I have one friend and nowhere to go. My only friend who's a girl, let's call her Allyson, is dating a douchey dude and she never wants to hangout now because of it. My only hobbies are watching anime, airsofting, and very seldom video games. The same song and dance. Every. Fucking. Day.

What really pisses me off is that all of the cooks at work patronize the fuck out of me even though I've been working there for eight months washing dishes for money to fuel the only hobby I have (I just watch anime online and shit, never bought anything.) One time the old pizza delivery guy even beat me with a mop. A fucking mop. I've been made fun of so much and hurt so much I just take it. I feel like an elephant at a circus every day. I can't quit or tell anyone because my dad is best friends with the restaurant owner. They all pretend to want to be my friend for shits and giggles too, and I've fallen for it twice.

The first time I went over to one of their houses with the Boss's son (Let's call him Vinny). When I walked up there were a bunch of older dudes (around 20) and all I did was stand there and wait for them to tell me to leave. I had no place there, and Vinny knew it. But no let's drag Tommy to Mitch's house just for shits and giggles. Only fun part was watching Mitch trying to pry his bong from his dog's mouth.

After all of this, I've been tricked and played. I just don't care. They poke and pry and tell me to "hang out" or shit. I just don't care. Even if something could be genuine I shrug it off. I've been broken. I've shrugged everything off lately. I've accepted laying here, drinking my coffee, with my eyes locked on this screen for at least five hours at a time. When I'm alone like this it's the only time I feel like I'm me. I don't know what to do, how to change, or who I am. 

This past eight months has changed me so much, and I don't know the real me. I sleep a lot and lucid dream because it's a great escape to be honest. I go to work at 5:00 pm so I just sleep until 4:00 pm so nobody bugs me. I then work and try to shrug off the hate as much as I can, and then I go home and cry. I cry for like a half an hour and then I sit on forums and shit until 4:00 am and then go to sleep and start again. 

My parents have noticed me changing now too and I'm afraid. My facial expressions have died, my sense of humor dulled, and I just don't feel like getting up. My parents have started accusing me of drinking or drugs. I don't even listen, I just drown it out so I can go back downstairs and be alone. The only genuine joy I've felt lately was three days ago when I went for a walk at the water tower hill where I used to walk with Allyson. I lied back in the grass and thought about how we used to watch clouds and she'd just say random things that she didn't even see. 

I don't know. I just don't care. I don't want to kill myself because it'll hurt. I've been 7 months self harm free because I promised Allyson I wouldn't because she's 10 months self harm free. Also, she made me this bracelet and sometimes I see it and think about her. But what do I do? What can a kid do when he's so broken that he doesn't know who he is. I don't care. That's all I can do.  









 I was just wondering, because this girl I like quit talking to me because I like airsoft and I like dressing up to play. But here's the kicker, she started talking to [this guy] (https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/10430853_809480539097194_7650496038351710603_n.jpg?oh=e9dfa016be3761652c705cabbd718768oe=544D8B30__gda__=1413517241_5a9916b7dcf375335d8557da08511eab) who is probably one of the most cliche neck-beard cosplayers I've seen. What do you guys think? 



















 So I had nothing better to do when I got up at 1:00 pm, I went back to bed and set an alarm for 2:00 pm. When I fell asleep I first remember being in my room, and I got up and went to the kitchen. I told myself, "This is a dream, I can do what I want."

Then I heard gun shots and I saw a bad guy pretty far off, but near my house. I looked down and there was a sniper rifle in my hands. I shot the bad guy, and then I thought, "I wish my friend Alex was here."

"Hey Tommy we got two more out front," IT WAS MY FRIEND. NUH UH. 
So I shot one guy who was out front and another guy and then I went downstairs and my friend disappeared. Then I woke up. 

But the whole time I was aware of the fact it was a dream and I thought up the gun and my friend right? It felt like I was totally in control.  




 I'm too afraid to tell my parents, or my friends but I've been seeing things. It started about a year ago, and I've had this inner monologue thing. It isn't my voice though. It's a calm male voice, around the age of twenty. He just *narrates* and **narrates** with breaks every once in awhile. I've read up about violent voices and violent things and it's just this damn narrating. Hell it's even talking right now. I just call the voice Josh. In my Spanish class one time it was being particularly annoying and I couldn't help but yell out, "Shut the hell up."

Now Josh has kept talking and still does a lot. But three months ago is where it really gets scary for me. I was taking a walk at my favorite place near the town water tower. As I walked down the path I saw a white dog, and it was really furry. When I walked closer I clapped my hands a bit and said, "Come here" and then the dog just disappeared. It didn't vanish or like vaporize, it was just gone. 

What do I do? I'm too afraid to tell anybody and I'm afraid it will get worse. I'm only 16 and I'm really really really scared. I've heard of far worse cases and I'm afraid people will call me crazy or send me somewhere. What do I do? 




 I do realize how rare they are since they're discontinued everywhere and nobody seems to have one at all. Usually I am very against buying used guns and gear, but this is my last chance.

[Boom.] (http://i.imgur.com/7kNagaU.jpg)

[And why the fuck not?] (http://i.imgur.com/ZxI8EDo.jpg) 














 Are [these] (http://www.amazon.com/Military-Equipment-Paintball-Tactical-Multicam/dp/B00K7CP35S/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8qid=1405811555sr=8-10keywords=emerson+combat+pants) legit? 




 For years and even to this day I've had the same dream a few times a week and I've never figured out why. What happens is I'm stuck on my couch (I sleep on a couch instead of bed) and I can't move at all. Then two giant rat men walk into the room and look straight at me, and these guys are **really really** scary looking. 

At this point they both look at eachother and whisper something into eachother's ears. They look at me again and instantly materialize chairs in their hands, and take a seat. Then they sit there and stare at me. They just **stare** this terrifying death stare.

The only way for me to wake up is to whisper, *"Mom"* for a really long time three times and then I wake up in the position that I was in the dream. Arms right to my side, and looking right at the door.

Does this have to do with lucid dreaming? I think it must have something to do with it.  




 That is all. I just wish guys could wear hats with cat ears on them and shit. I think they're funny, and I also like how they look. I just wish I could without looking like I'm gay or an Asian chick.  




 I lost a friend on Xbox that I met while on a cruise a year or so ago. His name was Dmitri. He was seventeen years old. He was a really really nice guy and he was on his way home from vacation with his grandparents. He liked Minecraft, various animes, and he was planning on going to go to college to be an anesthesiologist. 

When I sent him some messages today wondering if he was up for some Battlefield 4 I didn't get a response right away. His mother replied and told me to join a private chat. Though her English was rough, she got the message across that her son had been on the plane. I told her that her son was a great guy and that I was sorry for her loss. 

I just wanted to share this so more people would know he was a great guy, and he was a human being who deserved more than this. Everyone on that plane was. 

Edit: lost not lose oops  




 So usually I've used my parents laptop or computer or the family computer for everything (I'm only 16). I built this laptop with the help of my uncle who loves computer stuff, and this is my first computer that's actually mine. 

Right now I am typing from the toilet, taking a shit while on a laptop, and buying the complete collection of Eureka 7 on Amazon. I haven't been this genuinely happy for awhile. 

Edit: Done pooping. Never used a laptop at all while pooping, this was my first time. Also, Eureka 7 complete collection coming next week. 




 I'm at about $2,500 or so since I've started if I roughly do the math.


JG AUG-$175.00

Echo 1 SOF 2- $260.00

Sniper My Mom Found At A Garage Sale- $50

Matrix M4- $280.00

WE Open Bolt M4- (On Sale) $260-something

Magazines for WE Open Bolt x4- $150



First Gear Order- $300

Second Gear Order- $250

Third (And upcoming kit) Gear Order- $500


So that's about.. $2,300 excluding shipping stuff. What about you guys? 
























 All I remember is this kid and this girl. The girl was somewhat mean to the boy and rode a scooter. Also it was in a city but it had to whole, "Can't leave my life sucks" vibe. PLEASE HELP.

Edit: FOOLY COOLY found it sorry  




 So I'm contemplating my next addition to the armory. I've always loved SCAR's, and I've always turned back to SCAR's when looking for a gun I truly want. 

When I was first thinking of GBBR's I almost got the WE Open Bolt SCAR-L. When I wanted to do a designated marksman loadout I thought of getting the VFC SCAR-H SSR. But out of all of these a SCAR-H really stuck out.

Since there isn't a GBB SCAR-H, the VFC isn't blow-back, and P* or Daytona Guns are out of the question I was immediately drawn to the [SCAR-H Recoil Shock by Tokyo Marui] (http://echigoya-guns.com/guns/index.php?route=product/productpath=36_35product_id=446).

How is the gun overall? I can't find many reviews, but from what I've seen it seems like a gun I can run for a really long time. Would it be good for medium range to longer ranges? I don't like to upgrade and would like a good stock gun. Anyways, any help would be awesome. 




 [I made this.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyl9rq_jVG4feature=youtu.be) 









 So I just watched the majority of Eureka 7: AO and I don't see why so many people hate it. Eureka 7 is my favorite anime, and Eureka 7: AO isn't that bad of a show either. Why does it get so much hate? 




 Just wondering if anybody here has taken cosplay to the next level and attempted a Simon "Ghost" Riley loadout from MW2. Now I know Call of Duty gets a lot of hate on this subreddit and in the airsoft community in general, but it's a very interesting kit to me. 

I have everything figured out to do a Ghost loadout and might order some gear and show up to the field in a Ghost loadout and surprise everyone. I just want to know if it's worth it or if I'll get made fun of. 









 I really want a side arm now, but I don't know what to do/get. I don't want a gas gun or a pistol, and I want something unique. 

I was thinking of maybe a shotgun, but shotguns seem cumbersome to carry. I was also thinking of the JG Scorpion, but I'm afraid that it will suck. 

One idea was the Tokyo Marui MP7 on a drop-leg holster but my dad won't order for me from overseas. 

Ideas? Help? 




 So after reading some stories here I thought this was another fun subreddit to come on and read some stories.

Well today I was talking to this girl I've been talking to for awhile. Usually she'll get hurt by some guy or something and I'll always be her shoulder to cry on blah blah. Well we've been good friends for the better part of the last two years and lately she seemed interested in me so I came up with a plan to ask her out.

So I call her up, ask how she's doing, and ask if she wants to go for a walk at our favorite place to talk. She says yeah, but she wanted to bring a friend. I say sure and I meet her at the top of the hill by the water tower like always. But as I was walking up I could swear I could here a guy's voice.

Whatever, keep walking it's probably just her manly friend Hannah. As I turn the corner to look and sit next to her like I always do that's when I saw her kissing some dude. I don't know who is he is and never did before. 

Now me being as awkward as I've always been can only mutter, "Hey um hi hey so sorry bye sorry." and run off in tears. But as I reached about half way down the road I stopped. I realized I don't give a fuck, and I don't care. I've been chasing her for this long, and have been lead on for this long. Why should I keep chasing? The dude looked like he was about twenty (we're both 16) so she'll get hurt anyways. 

Well thanks a lot /r/howtonotgiveafuck you really helped me with this and helped me realize how to not care.  




 I'll just paste it here quick, I need opinion on if this would be a good enough start to a short zombie survival comedy film. I'm not very good with formatting so bear with me.

**Scene 1
(Scene fades in and two people are seen. One slaving over a sink, the other drying.)**

**Tommy: (Wiping his sweaty forehead with his fore-arm)** Man...

**Dalton: (Turning to Tommy from his drying station)** When the heck do we get to leave? I have lonely videogames and soda waiting at home.

**Tommy: (Jokingly punching him)** Probably soon.

**(His boss walks in)**

**Vinny: (His voice is joking)** Hey **(whatever nickname he uses at the time)**, hey Dalton. Go sweep and mop the back, put that stuff away, and I'll have you out of here.

**Tommy: (His eyes light up)** Oh. Y-yeah! Okay. **(He grabs his towel and wipes his hands)**

**Dalton: (He goes to put away a container and drops it)** Dang!

**Tommy: (He picks it up and sighs. He goes to put it back in the machine)** Ah man.

**Vinny: (He grabs the container)** Hey it's fine, not like it'll start a super zombie pandemic huh?

**Tommy: (He laughs nervously)** Huh yeah probably not.

**(Camera zooms in as Vinny puts away the container on the stack of other containers. Their laughter is heard in the background as the scene cuts out abruptly. The title slams over the black screen)**


**Scene 2
(The scene cuts back in abruptly in a similar fashion as before. A text box that says, "3 Months Later" cuts into the scene just like the title. As the next scene plays out actors and music names will fade in. Tommy is sitting on a log at what appears to be a garabage dump)**
 









 I was looking at shotguns like I always do because I've always dreamed of a Zombie Survivor kit. Anyway, I was looking and I want an M870 because they are more survivor-esque and more civilians have them than M3's. 

But I've come to realize most shotguns are either single shot M870's by GP or Tri-Shot M3 variants by Matrix, JG, blah blah all the same. 

Why haven't they made a **SPRING** tri-shot M870? 




 So for fun I started a band with some friends, and it's gotten a little more serious. We need some sort of logo but I have no clue where to start because of our name. Our band name is The Real Crime Stoppers, just because we thought it was funny. How would I make a logo or symbol for that? I have no clue where to start. 




 So when I order my new gear I'm going to do a helmet, goggles, and half mask combo with my headset. [Here] (http://imgur.com/tTpNJvH) is something I threw together in photoshop to get it planned out. What do you guys think? I want to paint a design on the half mask, and I planned on doing the [Smiling Titan's mouth] (http://x3.fjcdn.com/comments/Nothing+scares+people+more+than+teeth+that+arent+supposed+to+_9e1b288a22ff818decbda3a985965229.jpg) from the Attack on Titan series because it seemed unique and cool.  




 Would I be able to take [this] (http://www.evike.com/products/46036/) mount and stick it to a mask to use a GoPro? 
























 I'll just make this a text post. Over the next few days just submit stuff here for the banner art. Otherwise, it's almost complete. 




 I'm pretty dead set on getting this camo for my next kit, and was wondering if any of you guys use it. I searched the sub and couldn't find anything. If anybody has pictures of how it looks with tan gear that would be cool.

edit: [What it looks like] (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/GWB_choc_chip_camo.JPG) 














 Tango down 




 DAE? 




 So with my drivers test around the corner I'm going to look for public fields. One field that got my attention was [Black Ops Airsoft] (http://www.blackops-airsoft.com/index.html) in Zion, Illinois. 

Has anybody been to this field? If so, how is the gameplay, area, or overall how the field is? Also one more question, I have a list of must haves if I'm going.

**1. Mask-** I'm getting [this mask] (http://www.evike.com/products/44222). Is mesh stuff okay? If not I'll just get a Dye mask or something.

**2. Gun Case-** I know I'll need to get a case, so I'll make sure to get that.

**3. Barrel Condom (hehe)-** This is what I see people put on their guns in videos at public field, so would [this] (http://www.evike.com/products/24715) suffice?

**4. Lastly, Dead Rag-** I'm assuming any old piece of red cloth would do, but I'm getting one with the Evike logo just to represent.

**5. New Spring-** So I'm getting a new [spring] (http://www.evike.com/products/31455/) since my FPS is really high on my gun. Will I be able to just throw this bad boy in my gun and be good to go?

Otherwise, I think I got everything down and I'm ready to go once I order everything. Am I missing anything?  




 So I've been seeing a girl for at least a year, and we just decided to make it "Facebook Official". I feel comfortable enough with her now and I want to believe she's the one. I'm only seventeen right now, and I would be totally content without being sexually active, all I really want to do is cuddle and stuff.

So we were hanging out today and she brought up the idea of sex. I thought, "Well that would be fun." I care enough about her to give her my virginity. But should I? She really really wants to at this point. I'm up for it, but I don't know if I should. I've never been in a relationship where I didn't bring up the idea. 

She said something about wanting to, "Bond our bodies physically," and "Become closer" or something. She's also 17, but not a virgin. Should I go through with this? Will it jeopardize anything? I'm totally blind on the subject and have no clue what to do. HELP.  














 I've seen a boat load of reviews of the older versions of this pistol, but not many reviews on this gun. Would it be worth the money? I need to pick up my first side arm and I really want a pistol. Thoughts? Concerns? 

[The gun itself] (http://www.evike.com/products/45591). 




 This is my current set up I'm going to be running for the better part of this summer. I've always loved the look of the average PMC kit so I went in that direction. Please excuse the tactical skinny jeans, I just got off of school and at the time I took these pictures and I was as giddy as a child on Christmas. Don't fret, I use eye-pro, I just left them at a friends house. For the purpose of picture, I thought my casual prescriptions would be fine. 

[FUCK WHEN EVER I TRY TO FORMAT PRETTY THE IMAGES ARE TINY SO HAVE AN ALBUM OF THE PICTURES NORMAL] (http://imgur.com/a/ArEwK)


**KIT LIST FROM TOP TO BOTTOM**

**Hat-** Basic tactical cap from Condor

**Patch-** Sassy MilSpec Monkey patch

**Comms-** Just a basic Element headset

**Shemagh-** Basic black and white Condor shemagh

**Jacket-** Just a Condor Softshell Jacket, nothing special

**Patch-** Hazard PVC American Flag Patch

**Chest Rig-** No name brand I added to the cart 

**Dump Pouch-** Just a Condor Drop Leg dump pouch

**Knee Pads-** Standard Condor quick release knee pads

**Sling-** GP sling plate, came with a one-point sling

Other than that I'll probably just get some Khaki's or some blue jeans to finish off the kit. 

**GUN**
It's a bone stock WE Open Bolt M4 I posted a little while back with a previous kit. I run four magazines right now, but plan to get at least six more (I'm very trigger happy.) Otherwise I hope you enjoyed my kit, and I tried to keep everything as detailed and nice as possible.  




 So the JG AUG uses a standard version three gearbox if I'm not mistaken. Would I be able to just take it out and drop in a [KA Version Three Gearbox] (http://www.evike.com/products/37365/) into the gun without much trouble?  




 So during the recent time I airsofted I couldn't wait to field my brand new WE Open Bolt M4, but there's one problem... It was too cold. 

It never occurred to me and I ended up just filming and taking pictures. But now I want a new AEG for when it is too cold out for my GBBR, and so I won't miss out on the action.

So I've narrowed down my search to two guns. My price range with everything I need to play is about $500.00 to $650.00.  I just want a gun that is guaranteed to work, that will last me awhile, and will have good performance at short to medium ranges. 

My first choice is the [VFC SCAR-L] (http://www.evike.com/products/45160). I've always loved SCAR's and I've seen just about every review on this gun drooling over it. 

My second choice would be the [GG GK-5C] (http://www.evike.com/products/44551/). I know this a newer gun to the airsoft scene, and I couldn't find many reviews on it. Has anybody used this gun/know anything performance wise or durability wise? It looks like a solid gun that I'd enjoy, and that would be pretty reliable. 

Any help would be nice, I'm not trying to be a bother at all with a bunch of questions.  




 I have a shit ton of friends who smoke pot, and I'm kind of curious. About half of those friends have become fuck ups, and half are perfectly fine. Most of the people I work with at a restraunt smoke pot, and they are all fuck ups though. I don't want to end up working as a dish washer for my whole life. 

I'm sixteen if that matters. I know that it won't magically transform me into a fuck up, but will I change at all if I do smoke pot? I really want to know what it's like, and I'm a 4.0 student, so I don't think indulging will effect me in any way. 

My dad said if I were to it's like alchohol, some people can handle it and some people can't. Is that the case? I need advice ASAP, because I was gonna ask a friend who frequently smokes if I could try it with him one of these days.  









 I want to go for an MK18 build, but have a few questions on barrel length. Would I have to buy a shorter barrel for the gun? Right now I have a standard WE Open Bolt M4 and I thought the barrel was 14.5 inches, does this mean a new barrel is in order?  




 I don't want to spend a lot of money on a rail system for my WE Open Bolt M4, but I really want a rail system. Is it true that the Daniel Defense Omega 7 inch rail system is compatible? 

[Rail system itself] (http://www.evike.com/products/31496/) 














 [The channel itself] (https://www.youtube.com/user/lonesofterhalberd).

After researching I finally got it to fit like I wanted in the art area. I know it's a little grainy, and I might fix that later. Just decided to get my channel fired up for the nicer weather and ready for airsoft footage. I decided to go with my main logo color and try to selective color it a bit, a little cheesy but I think it's pretty nice. Thoughts?  




 Will [this stock] (http://www.evike.com/products/42150) fit on the WE Open Bolt M4? Also, are there any guides on how to take off the LE stock that comes with the gun? 









 I was curious how many of you guys have Zombie Surivial-esque kits, or apocalypse kits? I was thinking of starting one, since my first main loadout is complete.

Also, would a Vietnam Era M16 have a place in any of these kits? I want an excuse to buy the WE Open Bolt M16 VN, but I don't want to make a VN kit.  




 So I'm investing in a nice kit and I was looking at TACO Pouches, the single rifle magazine ones to be exact. I saw a video on a YouTube channel and they shook the chest rig around and the magazines didn't move, but I'm still not convinced. 

With TACO pouches will I be able to run around, slide, sprint, jump, and roll with my magazines in these pouches? I want to get pouches to protect my magazines since they are like thirty dollars a pop.  




 So I recently bought my first real primary weapon, and being that all of my disposable income goes into airsoft, I now have enough money for a sidearm. 

So there's one pistol I was wondering about, and couldn't find many reviews on. The [WE 3.8 Compact] (http://www.evike.com/products/41759/).

Now I've had great luck with WE GBBR's so far, but I've heard of problems with their pistols. For the price, this gun looks pretty and for the price seems nice. Thoughts? 




 *Ten Years Ago Today 




 Here are the questions,

**1.** I heard [this rail system] (http://www.evike.com/products/31496/) is compatible. Is it? 

**2.** As for upgrades I was only going to buy the RATech NPAS kit and Trigger Box. Anything else I should invest in? 

Edit: No picture, it was messed up. 




 Very very excited to enter the realm of GBBR's so here's [the kit itself.] (https://imgur.com/a/Cbrfl)

Kitlist:
[Gryffon Golem Chest Rig] (http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.php?products_id=15135)

[Gryffon Dragon Spine Belt](http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.php?products_id=15137)

Otherwise the other stuff from my kit was bought from tactical gear trade but I don't recommend ordering from that website. Overpriced, shipping was high, and took a long time. 

The gun itself is a WE Open Bolt M4 totally stock. I plan to upgrade with an NPAS and new Trigger Box. Otherwise I might get an RIS and crane stock. 

Edit: Buncha formatting crud

**Warning Potato Pictures** 




 To begin, I was **very** hesitant to order from Evike given all the horror stories I've heard here. I have to say, my whole experience has been very enjoyable. 

To start, I wanted the WE Open Bolt M4. I would usually order from ASGI, but they do not stock as many guns as Evike, or at least in the GBBR department. So after researching I didn't want another AEG, so to Evike.

At first there was a problem with our credit card (My father's credit card of course, I gave him the money and he deposited it etc.). When he was on hold for over five minutes I was certain it would be a grueling affair. Somebody picked up right away and a young man named Michael described the problem very politely. We just needed to raise our limit on the card and the gun was ordered!

Now another con I heard about with Evike was that you had to pay for shipping, but the price wasn't even that much. It was only twenty five in shipping for a gun and everything I needed to skirmish. After ordering I was informed the next **morning** that the gun was shipped. Within three or so days I got the gun. Only three days was how long it took, even with the cheapest shipping. With ASGI it was two weeks before I got my gun, and the shipping was free. Even though it's free, two weeks seems like a long wait. 

All in all, everything I've heard about Evike is wrong and my experience was very enjoyable. 10/10 would order from Evike again, and I'm not ordering from ASGI again. 

Edit: It took no longer than ten minutes for our call to be transferred. 




 I'm writing a persuasive paper on why airsoft should be offered as an extra curricular acticity in school. Now all SB199 or whatever or kids being shot by police stuff aside, what would be some good points to make? I figure it's fun and helps with team building and friend stuff. Any tips? Any other points I could use?  




 So I've been contemplating a new addition for my armory. I LOVE the look of a SCAR-H but there are no GBB SCAR-H's and I don't want just another AEG. 

So if I were to buy a VFC SCAR-H and buy a P* engine for it, what do I need to buy? I have a list of a few things, if somebody could fill me in on the mistakes that's be great.

[Engine Itself] (http://www.evike.com/products/37091)

[Tank] (http://www.evike.com/products/36570)

[Air Tube System Thingy] (http://www.evike.com/products/40898)

[Battery for FCU] (http://www.evike.com/products/37904)

[Charger] (http://www.evike.com/products/30777)

As for the [gun] (http://www.evike.com/products/32613) I was planning on ordering it before-hand separately with magazines and BB's. Is my checklist complete? Any help from seasoned P* owners would be awesome. 
 




 I'm just a dude in highschool with a few quick questions. So I just asked this girl on a date that I've been talking to for awhile. How much money should I take with me? Like average movie price, and a nice dinner? Also, would we go to dinner then movie or vice versa? Or does it not really matter?  




 I'm pretty set on getting a JG Scorpion, and to increase effectiveness, I thought doing a LiPo mod for the gun would be beneficial. 

I've seen somewhere around here a guide on how to modify the gun to take a 7.4v LiPo. Could anybody dig it up or point me in the right direction? 




 Will [this holster] (http://www.evike.com/products/34450) work with a P99? 




 As for any new subreddit I'd like to lay down a few quick rules.

* Read the Side Bar
* Read the Stickies
* **Don't be a dick**

Otherwise have fun, post away, and spread the word!
The whole reason reason I made this subreddit is because in Wisconsin, and the surrounding states airsoft isn't very... Alive.
Well here in Southern Wisconsin there are a few teams trying to make a difference and really spread the love of the sport. So spread it, play, subscribe, and have fun!

 Is ranger green, sage green, and smoke green the same thing as foliage green? 




 For my primary weapon I'm deciding on the [WE SCAR L] (http://www.evike.com/products/36555) and for my secondary weapon something a [little unconventional] (http://www.evike.com/products/25041).

Thoughts? Concerns? Any tips or information I should know about?  




 So I have a six hundred dollar budget, and I want to jump into the GBBR world. The WE seems like a really good choice out of thr box, and of course I'd get upgrade parts from RAtech and such. I've been on Arnies Airsoft, Airsoft Society, and a plethora of forums to find reviews. I've also watched every review on YouTube. At this point I'm pretty dead-set on this gun.

Now with six hundred dollars will I have enough for the gun and magazines? If so, how many magazines should I buy? I usually play thirty minutes games at our friends private field, with short breaks for reloading and drinks.

Next quick question, anybody with past experience, what parts should be replaced? Delving into a whole new type of airsoft rifles is pretty confusing. All over I've heard, " RAtech, RAtech, RAtech."

HELP /R/AIRSOFT! 




 Will the [WE SMG 8] (http://www.evike.com/products/43558) fit in [this] (http://www.evike.com/products/38605/) holster? 




 I've read about every review on forums, and have watched every video. At this point, the Vector seems like a reasonable choice for my next order. 

The problem is that every review gives the same information. Usually it's the, "Feels great" and "Really realistic." If I wanted to use this gun for field play would it work? If not, would the Angry Gun power-up silencer be a good choice for field play? 

I have a friend that uses the KWA MP9 with no upgrades for field play, and he fares pretty well. Noting that, the Vector seems like a sensible choice for a unique GBB SMG for field play. 

Does anybody have any information, reviews, or help on whether or not this gun is good for field play? 














 Best battery option or what battery for the VFC SCAR-L? 




 Pretty much it They are a huge part of many Japanese paintings, early Japanese art, and even anime today, but never the fruit itself. As far as I know I've never really seen much Japanese cuisine with cherries.

 So in a toaster, there must be something that controls the amount of heat allowed to be put in the wirey things that make the heat.

In theory, could I take out or disable whatever this is and put the toaster together and see what happens? Instant toast?  



















 THANKS CRATE AND XYSTED FOR SHOWING ME THE LIGHT 














 I'm doing a presentation on depression in adolescence for my sociology class and since I have no friends or people to survey at my school I'd like to ask you guys some questions here if that's allowed. If only teens could answer that'd be ideal, but if you guys remember being depressed as teens/have had depression since your teen years I'd love those answers too. 

1. How old are you?  
2. Are you male of female?  
3. At what age were you diagnosed with depression?  
4. What is depression like for you?  
5. What is the root of your depression?  

If this type of post then I don't mind if it's deleted, but if you guys could answer I'd love to bring light to this topic in my presentation. This survey would help a lot.  




 I really want to do a loadout with all OD green gear, or a mixture of OD green and tan. I'm mostly leaning towards all OD though because camo can be a hassle and I just want something simple, effective, and that won't break the budget. 

How effective can solid color loadouts be? Do any of you guys have solid colored loadouts you could post for reference?  









 I got my feels hurt :( 




 I'm super excited. Not sure of the quality but there are plenty of seeders and the comments say it's good quality.

 I keep getting flooded with different suggestions from Meep and Dacrate and I just need a solid list of three shows. Lately my thing has been slice of life, shit with good lessons at the end of show, mind fucks, , and good character development (i.e. toradora, mikakunin de shinkoukei, sakurasou no pet na kanojo, welcome to the nhk)

I need answers and options people, shoot.  





























 Cameroncock said it would be today and I can't find anything saying so nor do I have the one year club thingy. I was assuming that I'd get that right when it was my cakeday or something. What do. I want to shitpost mp5k on /r/airsoft.  




 What are your guys' New Years resolutions? Mine is to do more meaningful things and to be better than I am now.  




 lolwut

I DIDN'T SPELL ANYTHING WRONG 









 I looked up the soundtracks and bgm's on youtube and I can't seem to find the song I'm looking for. It sounds like there are some sorts of deeper string instruments, and it plays during the scene that the Sleeping Knights are taking their picture by the wall. It also plays before this when Asuna and Kirito are flying back to their cabin they lived in during the Aincrad arc. It appears countless other times in the show but this is all I could think of for how to find it off of the top of my head. Any help would be great, I need to download this song somehow.  









 I've decided on playing a designated marksman/sniper-ish role and I've been researching a lot of different rifles and found myself really digging really long snipers and guns of the 7.62 variety. After looking around I thought a G3 would really fit this role. Sadly, the only decent option would be the Classic Army G3, which I can't find in stock anywhere or the Tokyo Marui G3, but I don't like ordering from non-American retailers because of shipping price. This left me with the option of the JG G3, or the Marui PSG-1 which I was far more welcoming of. Also, I love how it looks and it's *loooooong*.

After digging through pages of Google searches and picking through YouTube trying to find a decent review or video of it in action, I couldn't find much. All that I really got out of my research was that it had a weird air nozzle or cylinder or something, it's old, and it's **creaky.** The creaky thing was the most stressed out of anything, which I don't really mind. 

Now, I'm not the tech savviest guy. I can change a hop-up, motor, and some other junk. Nothing too godly. My concern is that this gun won't perform as I need it to stock, and I'm not sure I can do what I need to get it shooting great. I know there are plenty of other guns in the price point that will outperform this gun a thousand times over, but I can't get over the great look of the PSG and I want something unique. 

Will the Marui PSG-1 be worth it if I get it? Will it make all of my wildest operator dreams come true? Or should I get researching another option for my designated marksman adventures? 




 I'm delving into the world of sneakier gameplay and the designated marksman sort of role, and have mostly everything planned out. Except for a side arm. Now I've had bad experiences with GBB's and I want something that I can play with all year that won't die on me. Now I've narrowed down my choices and read/watched about every review about some of my choices, but I'm still iffy.

Tokyo Marui MP7 AEP is my first choice because I've heard nothing but good things about it, I heard that it's quieter and have seen videos of it shooting and it seemed quieter than the normal AEG/AEP. 

My next choice would be the Galaxy/CYMA MP5K but it's hard to find in the US and I've heard mixed reviews about it. What's nice about the MP5K is that it uses a normal gearbox so maintainence isn't as big of a deal. 

My final choice would be the JG MAC-10 or possibly the marui, but I want to keep it HK for the sake of my guns matching. The JG seems nice though and sturdy. It's also really really quiet from the videos I've seen of it shooting. 

I'm stuck and I don't know what to do. What are your guys' opinions? Are any of these a good choice? Do you guys have any good options or ideas? 




 All of my what, http://www.evike.com/products/50670/ 
























 To give a little background, I just turned 17 on the third, don't know if this has anything to do with anything. Some of my Reddit friends may see that I posted this, I don't really care. I want to travel the world and I want more now. I live in a shitty small town of only 1,000 to 1,200 people. At this point in my life my grades are only good enough to get out of highschool. I own a small business doing graphic design and articles, and I wash dishes at a local restaurant and started training to cook, but that won't get me anywhere. I need to take charge but it's so hard. When I graduate I'm either going to be a neet, or working my shitty jobs living in a shitty apartment. Now, I've had plans to take two years of general studies and get some sort of art degree, but I don't think that will get me where I want to be or anything. I just want to help people and see the world, and get away.

Now that that's out of the way. I would follow my uncle's footsteps and join the military, but even then I don't think it'd be worth it. I don't believe in anything that we're fighting for. Would joining the peace corps or whatever work? Should I just pack up and leave when I turn 18 and freelance? I'm at my wits end, but the only thing I really want now is to be away and to help people.  




 I thought it was bullpups, ak's, and other things but I've finally realized, it's 7.62 stuff with big magazines. SCAR-H's, FAL's, M14's, G3's. Love em'. 









 In a group of friends we are conducting one of the first studies on weaboos, why they happen, and other stuff. We're even going as far as going to an anime con to interview ourselves some weabs and get primary source information. Then we're filming it all, and making a documentary. Wish me luck. You guys got any articles or sources? 














 I got this idea for a show. You take a bunch of tactical gear with googly eyes and attach them to strings like puppets, and the main character is a shemagh with googly eyes who has a blog. They are all best friends. It would be called, "Shemagh with a Blog."

Let's make millions.  
 




 Feelsgoodman. 





























 I have to record all results so I have to put that and the sweary words in my report lol. She probably won't care though and I got enough info to complete the assignment, thanks.  














 I just stuffed that fucker with toilet paper and turned it on over and over again. By the time I was done it was making smoke. Should I go back and stop it?

You know, with your obsession with Russian stuff lately this only makes sense.  




 **SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY** ONLY WITNESS THE HANDICAPPED HORROR, THE BED RIDDEN BEDLAM, AND THE RETRIBUTION OF THE RETARDED. IT'S GOING **DOWN**. 




 If they ever made a live action movie of the anime Steins;Gate, [Keanu Reeves] (https://hollywoodhatesme.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/keanu-reeves.jpg) would be perfect for the part of the main character [Okabe Rintarou] (http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/122643.jpg) if he slicked back his hair messily. 
 














 All of the sudden I have this harem of SMG's I want to buy and I am very confuse. It's between the new [Echo 1 Spectre] (http://www.evike.com/products/49769) and the [KWA Scorpion.] (http://www.evike.com/products/49710) Turns out Tuesday I got paid so now I have $200~ more than I thought. I'm on the verge of just buying both guns. Will I regret this decision? I still have to pay my dad for my car but that would only be another month of work. I am confuse.  




 Now all Eastern bloc and Russian guns seem cool to me. The want started with an AKS-74UN then to RPK, but now I just want to buy everything Russian and Eastern European. Fuck.  




 [Linkerino.] (http://www.evike.com/products/49710/)

I'm thinking of just picking one up next check for plinking around and for fun until more magazines come out. Also, people will be scouring YouTube for reviews and even if I put out a average to shit-tier review people will eat it up and I'll get views.  




 And yes EzDeezer, I know American Psycho is. *Shhhhh*

I haven't watch anything but Comedy Central and anime for months so my knowledge of movies is pretty dead. Also I need shit to read and keep me busy in class. 

**DISCUSS** 









 Drawing sucks. I will post my shitty art project tomorrow because it is ber operator. 

Have any of you guys even taken a shitty drawing class? 


































 Look promising at least. I've still had my HERO2 for awhile so it might be time for an upgrade. What action cams do you guys have?

Edit: Linkerino, http://www.evike.com/products/49539/ 









 That is all. Also I know about the other chat sub for the super secret cool kids so you guys should approve me.  














 If so, **OH MY GOD IT'S SO MUCH MOR-** 

They're making  up for that last season if you ask me, but now there's guns and stuff so it's like 25% better.  




 So every day of the week is dress up, and I think that I'm going to dress up like a terrorist as a joke. Monday is dress like a hero day so I think that'll be funny.  




 I think pudding is a beverage.  




 Usually I get up do all of my morning stuff and go to school. Today I grabbed a handful of anxiety medicine and some sort of pain killers and jammed them in my pocket. Took something my dad was taking for eye surgery pain and that made the walk to school way better. It was fucking awesome. 

Walking to school was awesome. Sitting in class was awesome. I actually talked to people and didn't give a fuck about how I looked. Psycho ex girlfriend's friend stabbed me in the hand with a pencil and I shrugged it off and called her a stupid cunt. Everything was fun and had meaning. It was weird. 

Whenever I would get in trouble in class before the teacher said what I did bad I would just take the detention, tell them what I did, explain why I know it's wrong and why I have fun being a dick, and then I'd go off to my next class. They didn't even have anything to say I was so on top of shit all day.  














 That is all. They didn't like my shitty average M4. Should I take a picture of it on my bed in the dark with a cellphone or something, because there are people who are getting more upvotes just doing that.  









 It's like six terabytes of the word poop and I'm going to put it in the shared files so a bunch of people open it. *Hue hue hue* 














 Supposedly there's a bunch of methane in Texas drinking water or something the front page told me. Catbrain needs to light the water from his tap on fire and post the results.  









 They don't though.  
What things do you guys like to dip in coffee? I like me a good apple cider doughnut or cinnamon Poptart with my coffee. One time I even dipped beef jerky in coffee (who knows why) and it tasted pretty good.  









 Found it on /r/teenagers, just type in mermur.it and it'll pop up.  









 I know the SRC is more realistic, and the KWA is better performance wise, but this gun is a nice middle ground. Should I get this pistol and take the risk? I know it will be better than the SRC because I've seen shotty reviews on the SRC. The SRC looks like a better collector's weapon than a skirmishing weapon. I really want a TT-33, and I really want a pistol. [The gun in question.] (http://www.evike.com/products/44404/) 




 I'm so tired and depressed I can't even force any jokes today. Feels like I'm going to crash and burn.  




 I don't think it's too bad for a first time

 What would happen if someone were to poo in a metal box, and then weld a lid on there and leave the box for a few years. Like, would the poo be gone?  




 I wish there was a game like Skyrim with a vast free roam and mountains, but imagine if there were huge and unimaginable monsters and beasts. Like mind boggling size and awe. I've always been fascinated with that concept and I wish something would come out. I'm talking like [this] (http://i.imgur.com/I6Vh4L1.jpg) big that just roam around and shit. The best part would be landscapes like Skyrim where you can just fucking go and go man.  




 Makes you feel like you're fucking autistic and when you have no missing assignments on a Monday you get a treat like a fucking child. There's also this point system she's talking about with coupons like I'm in second grade. The only upside is that I can usually burn through two episodes of an anime and she doesn't notice. Wtf.  




 I have no clue what is happening. I just take everything home and do it there. 









 Do not watch this. It will make you sad. 

:( 




 :( 




 I am seeing if we can or not by posting this. Don't mind little old me. 

Edit: No, no we can't. 
*Sigh* 




 Now I have to wait six days to watch the new SAO? Last week I could watch it right when I woke up. Now I can't watch it before going to my shitty job like I always do. Wtf.  




 So right after I grabbed on to the casket to pallbearerer or whatever my phone went off. The Fresh Prince of Bell Air theme song. It rang throughout the crowd of appalled family members and the large cemetery. Since the casket was so heavy, and we were already carrying it I couldn't get to my phone to turn it off and the phone was left in my pocket to play the whole time we carried it to the grave. What the fuck. Why.  




 Just kidding they aren't. I don't want to go. I am not sad and I don't care that the relative that died is dead. This is more painful to me because now I can't go to work tonight. I would rather make money.  




 What is happening I am very confuse. 

Edit: I am not learning anything wtf 




 I'm a fairly short guy and I ordered a Barrett as most of the regulars on the sub know. I've watched a lot of videos but I never realized how big the Barrett actually is. It's like 4.7 feet long, and I'm not a very tall guy. Will this be fine? Will I die of exhaustion just heaving it around?  









 This thing just began working so I can post some shit. I have nothing to post, but do you guys have to deal with stupid shit like this? School issued Ipads or anything? 




 Yeah it just turned on and has been running on the charger for about ten minutes. Lel.  









 After five years of usage my DSi died today. It's been across the US from Wisconsin, to South Dakota. It's even been to Canada. My DSi has gone with me through various moves, and different houses as well. I was 11 when I first got it. I remember going to Gamestop with my dad to get it, and being first in line at the stroke of 12:00 AM. I remember the giddy excitement and first turning it on and tinkering with it during the car ride home. I remember pure joy. 

It didn't have a name or anything, just my initials carved in the back. I've beaten countless games, and played through many games of Pokemon with it. I've beaten many people too with my DSi, and won many battles. I've had many great times during lunch with friends playing Pokemon,  trading, battling. I've had countless adventures. I've had many a good memory with my DSi in hand. 

Over the course of the past five years I've taken my DSi all over the US. When I was 11, I took my DSi to Washington, Alaska, and even Canada. I remember taking it to the top of the Seattle Space Needle, and through the bustling Pike's Place Fish Market. While taking a cruise in Alaska I played my DSi looking to the open ocean. I took it to the beautiful Butchart Gardens of British Columbia, Canada. When I was living at my grandfathers farm my sisters and I took a trip to South Dakota. I remember sitting in the beating sun looking over the barren Badlands with my DSi in hand. I even took pictures of a rabbit we found with my DSi. 

While moving from my grandfathers house to where I lived on the golf course I remember buying Pokemon White, the game I played until today. By now the corners were smashed/damaged and the L and R buttons on top didn't even work. As long as I could play Pokemon I was content. While working on the house, painting, and during the move I remember good times defeating the new game while taking breaks. While living at this house though I took a break from my DSi. This time was spent diving into the world of Call of Duty and X-box, so I would fit in with others. My DSi took it's rest in my desk drawer collecting dust. 

A year or so would pass, and eventually I would move into the house I am living in now. During the move I found my DSi, and dug up a charger. After plugging it in, bingo, it worked. I started a new game on Pokemon White and began to play a lot more. My X-box had become repetitive, but I found time for both game systems. This past year was the most time I had ever spent playing on my DSi and I even made a good friend in the process. 

With the introduction of school issued I-pads I figured, more people were playing games, and if I were to play my DSi nobody would care. This I was correct on, and I would begin my day in Photography class on Pokemon White smart mouthing the teacher. This I regret, however playing I do not. I would find time in the hallways to play, during my study halls in the school library, and in Geometry class. I had been playing one day during lunch and a now good friend Jacob struck up a conversation about what I was playing. Before this I never talked with about much, and Pokemon became our common ground. Every day we would play during lunch and get stronger, battle, trade. This past year was great, and my DSi was being used to it's full potential. 

Today, while waiting for my student teacher conference I sat in the car, and sipped on my cup of coffee. I felt around in my pocket for my DSi, which I always carried with me. I flipped it open as usual, clicked and tapped away, and played Pokemon like usual. While playing the screen froze. Odd enough, but I thought it was probably the cartridge. I turned it off, closed it, and took out the game. I inspected the game, and the slot. Everything seemed normal so I plugged the game cartridge back in and turned it on. It turned on, but the screen was white. It remained frozen and then shut off. Since the battery was fully charged from the night before, I attempted to turn it on again. Nothing. I had assumed the worst, closed my DSi, and came to terms with it's demise before going to my conference. 

5 years of pure joy is what my Nintendo DSi had brought me, and it was worth every penny. There are so many other adventures I've left out of this, but so many that will not be forgotten. I used my DSi until the day it couldn't run, and simply couldn't turn on. 5 years of pure joy.

 I have one last chance to make my last day of summer mean something. 

Just kidding, I'm probably going to watch anime and eat in the dark while people do things and don't invite me.  









 Mine was probably about a minute ago, I picked up a sock to blow my nose and it was  a fap sock. I still blew my nose with it though. 

Either that, or to get my current job I got the old cook re-addicted to crack so he would get fired.  









 Ground up.  




 Pretty shitty last day to say the least, and I had it all planned out to make it the best last day of summer ever. 

**Fuck Up No. 1**  
I planned to go for a walk with this girl I like and then go back to her place to play guitar and shit. This was supposed to be at 12:00 in the afternoon, I woke up merely twenty minutes ago as I write this.

**Fuck Up No. 2**  
My pizza oven broke and my regular oven isn't working. I really really wanted a stuffed crust Tombstone pizza to lift my mood.

**Fuck Up No. 3**  
The girl mentioned before called me. You know when you answer the phone and you're nervous and you accidentally hang up? Ha, well of course that happened. Oh also, now she thinks I'm mad at her. 

**Fuck Up No. 4**  
So when I'm bummed out, sometimes shooting my airsoft guns is fun. I went to grab my good ol' [JG AUG] (http://i.imgur.com/BqMGLVH.jpg) from the wall to plink around at some cans. It would not fire. I take off the barrel and receiver and look around inside looking for some sort of answer. Nothing. Fucked. My dad is letting me order my new gun when he gets home anyways, so hey not too bad. 

**Fuck up No. 5**  
My grandmother died. Fell down the stairs, hit her head, aneurysm, whatever. I don't care that she died, I just don't want to miss work for a funeral. I want to make money. Also, I have to be a pallbearer and I don't want to carry heavy things while people stare at me. Fuck. 

Well at least I have some anime and instant coffee to make this day at least 25% better. How is/was your guys' last day of summer?  



















 My friend called me a bitch, I ain't even mad. Now I hear [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-t06qBtiJk) song and get bummed out.  









 Their new album is out October 7th if any of y'all are stoked. I know I'm super fucking pumped because I'm 83% sure it will redeem their last piece of shit. The name of the album is kind of lame though (Everything Will Be All Right in the End) so we'll see.  




 I'm such a loser that I've watched so much anime to know what some of the Japanese stuff says. 

HA.  




 I was just having a conversation with a friend and realized this, I mean I guess that's how any band name is formed but still. 

Like, "Ricky Ross and the Staplers"  
"Plywood and Pete"  
"Street Curb something something"  
"Camera Lense McCarmichael and the Nickel Train" 

The possibilities are endless.  




 Well I guess how they smell is a matter of opinion, but I'm talking about [these] (http://stinkbugsguide.net/brown-marmorated-stink-bug.jpg) little fuckers. But you know I always thought, where do they come from? What do the little baby ones look like?

Well, while I was cleaning up dog poo today I looked in the garden wheelbarrow where there were some old zucchini and sure enough, there were [little baby ones living all over it.] (http://i.imgur.com/P8o8A93.jpg) 

Sorry, the picture is bad because they were flying at me and stuff, but they were the same thing. I'm like 97% percent sure.

Edit: Well fuck I guess I can take [video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwPsqP87l64feature=youtu.be) too.    




 This is somewhat random but I just stumbled upon the thought reading some manga. 
 
For me, 

**1.** Coffee  
**2.** Elite Force BB's  
**3.** New book/manga  
**4.** The oven at work  
**5.** Autumn leaves  

What about you guys?

Edit: Oh yeah, A1 steak sauce. That stuff is my shit.  




 I told him that just because the gun is heavy doesn't mean it's realistic and he replied,

 "I know but I mean the heaviness makes it feel like you have a real weapon. Air soft is a great sport don't get me wrong but paintball is more of a rush when playing since being shot in the head with a paintball gun can kill you if they cheat where as with air soft gun hurt but the worst it can do is break skin or hit an eye."

Wat. 

Edit: I looked up the annual injuries in paintball, averaging around 20 per every 100,00 annual players. I also showed him a chart and demolished this argument. I'll post what he says next. 

Another Edit: He said he had to go do chores and that the argument was over. Ha. 

 




 Yeah, it doesn't work worth shit. Fuck whoever told me this. 

Also, Starbucks Instant coffee packets actually taste like real coffee and they don't taste bad.  




 I want some to randomly put in montage parodies or airsoft montages. I like [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upkYQqbrjSc) song. 

You guys got any? 
























 Yes, it would 




 All of the stupid has been posted/sticky'd by AMGTD and slayer before he left 




 I was assuming only official stuff could be stickied 




 It was just in the other room and I had to be sure lol  




 It's not official subreddit business and you can't ban someone for spoiling a stupid movie 




 I really like those pants. I think it's interesting because it incorporates the idea of camouflage with a modern twist, opposed to just wearing regular M81 BDU pants.  




 [Whoaaaaaa] (http://i.imgur.com/BxV0tsZ.jpg) 




 Dude what treadmill? I have the same exact bottle too 




 This is fucking stupid and you should unsticky this 









 Oh definitely, I've always wanted a SCAR 




 For some reason you just look like that gun just suits you.  




 Oh, that'd explain the detail and such. Good idea to implement model painting with airsoft 














 The second Hyouka OP is really catchy. The first one is great but it's not something I can listen to casually like a catchy song.  




 You are *exactly* like him lol 




 Yeah it's great 




 I'm ready for a feels trip 




 But I have to watch Shingatsu wa Kimi no Uso now lol 




 Wait I didn't mean to ask anything, oops lol. Also, now that you mention it looking back the whole mood and background of the show got increasingly more colorful as the show progressed.  




 I'll just share my quick interpretation quick I guess. 

Houtarou mentions throughout the entire series the rose colored high school life and through the whole series he grows into this role. Do you think that final scene with the cherry blossoms and shit was foreshadowed by all of that or a finalization of his transformation? 




 All in all it was fucking great except for the confusing end. Thanks based batcrains for suggestion  




 My dad got his nipples pierced at Rock Fest in 2009 or so. Still has em' pierced. 




 Very nice job on the paint. It all seems very thorough and smooth with no terrible drips.  




 Damn, what's that first mod? It's so sleek. 




 Little late, but I didn't feel like posting link since it's not too unique. A step up from my old set up.

 Ohhhh. People should join the Skype chat 




 Well, to Elucidate means to clear up or explain so "Elucidator" means to explain or clear?  




 What chat? 




 Just the way you worded that didn't make sense. You probably meant something along the lines of "Airsofting makes you sweat, and you will sweat hard." 

What you said is just repeating the same thing twice with more or less the same sentiment.  




 Magazines. Always make sure to have the right amount of magazines. 




 He'll sweat and ***and*** he will? Wow.  




 First one is Danish Frog Men 




 Contractors and mercs don't wear military camouflage.  




 Whoa, how did you do that to the Masada. I don't know why, but that looks like something I'd want to do. Any better pictures? 




 I feel like I'm one of the only people actually excited about this game. All of my friends are "DAE PC MASTER RACE GUISE COD SUCKS" but I think it looks cool 




 What gun is it? 




 Wow, most speedsofters come off as douchey and annoying. I'm glad you posted this and this really changed my opinion to say the least. You're a respectable dude. 




 Vignettes are nice in moderation. This one is a little overpowering, but a great picture nonetheless.  




 Must be why the camera quality is so terrible 




 Post things like this to /r/airsoft 




 Well then he needs to post to /r/airsoft 




 Not really unique or special, but a nice piece nonetheless  




 I'm pretty sure he's joking, otherwise this post would be re-directed to /r/airsoft. 




 Nah, I'm a small dude but still growing 




 5'6"  




 It's alllllllll goooooood 




 I was too. Making light jokes about it eases the pain of being both mentally and physically unfinished.  




 Yeah lol 




 HS5 jizzes in a tray and it's solidified 




 Type 1. The one you can get when you aren't fat. I weigh only 106.  




 It's fucking eyes man 




 I habe diabeetus 




 My mom does already and thinks tanning helps 




 For some reason my parents have taken a liking to tanning beds because they want "more vitamin D" and when I crawled up from my cave to get some coffee they suggested I go with them.

Well suggesting turned into saying I don't get enough sun even though winter just got over here. I like my cave. I don't want skin canxer.  




 I'm gonna attempt to watch the first season, but there's so much it makes me uncomfortable. Just, every chance they get they put butts in. 




 Wow. It takes something else to make a video with so much emotion and beauty with such content. 




 Oh yeah, of course 




 That looks like a fun sniper just to have around.  




 Ha, yeah 




 It's GBB 




 Both top left and right are dank as hell 




 Not really, it was just a lot of butts. Plus, it was made in 2007 




 Literally every action scene zoomed in on their crotches and butts and there's a lot of fan service. I thought Upotte was bad. 

**I have grown immune.** 




 That url, lol 




 Well it's not 4/17, and bandwagons are stupid 




 Rhodesian blah blah blah loadout? 




 I'm just gonna put my PMC kit here, http://i.imgur.com/7Rdnz91.jpg 




 yus 




 It's my favorite gun in BF4 and would be a fun gun to have in my collection 




 I'm okay with this. I just wanted to see my favorite show hit the finals. Plus, they were both worthy so that's awesome. 




 I really want that gun just to have it 









 What? 




 I'll be totally okay if Steins;Gate doesn't win, I just wanted to see it go to the finals because it's my favorite show

 Sounds pretty great, I'll have to look into it 




 I'm very tempted. You said you could negotiate? Also, where are you shipping from? 




 You have a PGM? 




 No I use Avast lol 




 Well I guess I'll just add that to my other security programs to make my computer strongerer?

 Yeah I know about VG and stuff and I know it'd make for less throat hit, but I hadn't thought of just using VG based juice for the entire mixture instead of picking up a bottle at my local shop and using it all for THC E Juice purposes.  




 I make THC E Juice 









 This is something that happened to me awhile ago when I was 11. I figured writing it somewhere would help me feel better-ish. I'm just going to type it how it's written in my little manifesto of mine.

Back in 2009, or 2008? I can't remember the year but it was awhile ago. I'm 17 and it happened when I was 11 for reference. When I was younger I took a grand trip to Canada, Alaska, and Seattle with my grandparents and my cousin. The cruise started from port in West Seattle (like by the Space Needle-ish and the cool stuff.) 

When we arrived in Seattle we decided to stay at a hotel for three days to visit the Dry Soda Company (I saw it on Food Network and was curious) the Space Needle, and, regretfully, the famous Pikes Place Market. Well, not regretfully as in going there was bad, but the market is a dark place in my mind because of my experience. 

We explored the lights and sounds, and shopped the first day. That was amazing. Seattle was, and is, a beautiful city with beautiful sights. Well, the "supreme travel itinerary" as my grandma dubbed it, was that we'd go to the Pikes Place market on the second day. Now, I don't know how it looks now, but when I visited there were a lot of homeless people. My grandparents told me not to pay any mind to them and to ignore them. This made me sad. A blemish of sorts, but it didn't deter me from the whole face of Seattle.

I remember that whole morning as vivid as yesterday. I woke up, ignored the not-so-inviting continental breakfast and waited for my grandparents to finish. Hell, I even remember playing Yoshi's Island DS on my DS Lite. Well, they were always cheap.

They finished up and we were off. As soon as we left the entrance we were greeted by a young women. She was obviously homeless by the tattered clothes and McDonalds cup with loose change in it. She smelled like pot and paint thinner. She looked hungry and distraught. Her haggard frame didn't take away from her still young looking face. She seemed to be in her late 20's or early 30's from what I recall.

Anyways, I remember reaching for my pokemon themed wallet with the intent to give her change. As I went to rummage for a penny or two my grandpa scolded me and snatched the wallet from my hands. "No test_subject8195" he said, "There's a reason she's like that."

"There's a reason she's like that."

That stuck with me. It still sticks with me. Here was this human being reduced to the status of a stray dog, and he said that. I remember sighing, still shocked at his demeanor, and trailing behind them. I remember seeing a young gentlemen, probably a concierge or a bag boy, chase her off. "Oh well." I remember thinking. 

Fast forward through a sea of cardboard pleas, winos, and street performers and we reached our destination. Pikes Place Market. I remember splitting off from my grandparents and cousin while watching a young gentlemen toss a fish around and do other tricks. After he was finished I clapped, and turned around. 

Gone. My grandparents were nowhere to be found and I was caught in a sea of fish smell, patrons, and the sinking feeling that I was inevitably fucked. I scrambled through the crowd to no avail. The thick smog of bodies clouded my view, and my calls for help went unanswered. After breaking through the crowd I found a back alley. Scared, confused, and hoping for a break from the hustle and bustle I walked through the alley. 

Torn flyers, waste bins, and other arrangements of junk littered the passage. Then I heard it. The sound that haunts my dreams and my mind when it wanders.

Gurgling. A low mumbling gurgle laced with coughs and the unmistakable sound of struggling. It sounded rather odd, but my adventurous 11 year old brain led me to the source. Oh how I wish it didn't. How I wish I would have just sauntered off or turned around.

I walked over to a tipped over trashcan, and a dumpster. I didn't know what to expect, but it wasn't like the movies. It wasn't slow, but it was silent. Save for the god awful gurgling and struggling. I even remember the picture on what I now assume was a craft beer bottle strewn along with the forgotten waste. There was a rabbit with a shit eating grin on its face giving a thumbs up. Soon after seeing that my eyes led me to the source of the sounds. 

It was a kneeling yet slumped, convulsing pile. Then she looked up. It was the homeless woman from earlier. I stumbled back and recoiled in fear. "She must have knocked over the trash can and hurt herself" I thought. The thought seems innocent now, and I wish it would have been the case.

Her tattered black hoodie was caked in what appeared to be vomit and bodily fluids. It was still fresh because I remember the smell overwhelming me. Then I saw it, there was a needle jutting out of her arm. At the time I couldn't comprehend what it was, or why the woman was acting so strange. It's that innocence I wish I could still possess. 

But no, this woman was overdosing. She was dying. In front of my eyes, this woman was dying and I couldn't do jack shit to save her. I was a kid, and I was afraid. 

She looked up at me and her lips seemed to try to form words, but nothing happened.  Merely shaking and more trembling before she fell and slumped even further on to the grimey alley ground. The look still haunts me, it still causes me to have panic attacks or throw up if I picture it well enough. The best way I can explain it without forcing myself to think too much about it, is milk with a little blue dye in it. That's what her skin looked like.

She feebly reached out at my pant leg. I stepped back more, and then she slumped over. I wasn't sure if she was dead, but I nudged her with my foot. She didn't move. She was dead, she had to be. 

I screamed. I screamed louder than I ever will in my life. I ran after that, probably the fastest I'd ever run too. I ran back the way I came, past the stupid fucking rabbit bottle, past the flyers, past the market area where I was before. I only stopped when I reached the gift shop area.

I cried. I cried more than I ever will I think. I never cared for my grandparents, let alone any of my relatives, but I was elated to find them browsing the selection of shirts. They were wondering why I was crying.  I eluded to the fact that I watched a woman die, and rather just told them I was hysterical because I was lost. I still wish that was the case looking back. 

I feel, like a part of me died when that woman died. I feel like watching anybody die an untimely and violent death would kill something inside of anybody. Seattle was, and is, a beautiful city with beautiful sights. 

I am never going back there though. I'm going to leave whatever part of me died there. That's the way it's meant to be.

 Vorpie save us from debt. Pls. Debt. Too strong.  




 Put off watching Cowboy Bebop for far too long because so many other shows seemed more appealing. I thought, "Oh old show, so it must be drawn old and gross." 

After listening to some of the soundtrack and a friend bugging me to watch it too much, I fired up Deluge and torrented that mother. Two words. Holy shit.

The whole story was amazing, the animation and art style was **leagues** ahead of the time. For 1998 it's a really pretty show. That coupled with the great soundtrack and story bumped it up into my top five.

If you've been putting off watching this show or feel iffy about it, watch it. 9/11 would watch again. 



















 Holy fuck more Steins;Gate anime on the way, also I just read the Epigraph shit and I'm shitting my pants.  




 Just the question above I guess. I've watched everything I can and I want to prepare myself for Steins;Gate Zero so I thought this would be my best course of action

Edit: Found them online and read them all, holy fuck 














 Man, probably the second worst case of post anime watching bummer feels I've had. Overall probably my new favorite slice of life with Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo in a close second. I just feel like it ended more completed with more material that hasn't been made into anime that isn't crap. 10/10 would recommend.  

Edit: Exclamation points are part of show title, I don't type with that much emotion 



















 I sat in the empty desk in front. I don't like being this far up in the row. 

Edit: Pretty sure she saw the title of this post since it's in bold blue lettering. I'm autistic.  




 Okay guys, finished up the patch, used the colors I was told to, and touched up all of the parts that were too detailed. 

[Here it is] (http://i.imgur.com/KkUDwVR.png)

Thoughts, concerns, things, memes?  
[DISCUSS] (http://i.imgur.com/QwWVIf9.gif) 














 Genuine question here since people are naturally social creatures and women need men to reproduce? 




 Okay so after some discussion and shit in the mod chat I've made [this revised patch idea.] (http://i.imgur.com/fDVxD2i.png)

Other options I'm considering is making the coat of arms thing red again but let's see how the blue works for you guys. Discuss and shit. I don't know about any of the financial stuff. 



 









 So I recently posted here asking for somebody to vectorize something, [this image in question.] (http://i.imgur.com/N89cDnO.png) and I need another quick favor. I've tried using threshold stuff and doing some of the things you guys reccomended but I just couldn't get the same effect as the picture above. 

If someone here could vectorize [this] (http://i.imgur.com/7ggq37x.jpg) image that would be awesome. Thanks! 




 After a somewhat busy past week, sketchy promises, browsing dank memes, and trying to erase a piece of the patch for about ten minutes after realizing it was food on the screen, I finished the patch idear for the official /r/a_irsoft patch. 

Here's a little album, http://imgur.com/a/x6LBh

The font choice was the hardest thing so if there are any other ideas speak up and I'll throw it together. Otherwise I need thoughts, opinions, what to fix, and other stuff. 
 




 Can somebody vectorize [this] (http://i.imgur.com/TqCAU8e.png) image for me? 

Similar to [this] (http://crissia.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/jack.jpg) or [this?] (http://www.vectors4all.net/preview/chigevara-face-free-vector.jpg) 









 This is kind of hard to explain, but when I airsoft I feel like a different person. When I started airsoft obviously [I had really bad gear and bad guns] (http://i.imgur.com/nmtS8ZN.jpg) and I thought, "I'm going to get better and get better gear." Ever since the days of plinking around with friends with our springers and LPEG's between jam sessions I knew airsoft was a different hobby. 

When I airsoft I feel stronger, and I feel like buying more gear makes airsoft me stronger. It's weird.  









 The sticky post on top of the sub has been too tantalizing for me and I'm ready to throw a design together and help get these patches made, so let's talk about it. Where/how are they going to be made and who do I give the design to? Are we gonna make this happen? 

If so, I'm making it after work tonight and I'll post up the design once I'm done. 

Edit: Home from work and going to begin work once I brew me up some coffee and get brainstorming.  




 That is all. Continue.  




 It only made redditing and browsing dank memes easier though.  






















































 Lots of fun things coming out soon.  
Lots of money I don't have.   




 I blasted a ten hour compilation of arab rap music until they shut up. Now I'm just listening to some podcasts and chilling 




 It really made me think differently about dreaming and how the mind works. I stayed in bed for like, a half an hour and thought about it. 




 Or a large gaming channel and going into airsoft with no knowledge of airsoft 




 Lol "hey guys I sucked Bob from ASGI's dick for this free gun please buy it" 




 Little sister is having a sleep over in the room next to me and being too loud so I'm blasting [this] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yLDUmyx3XXU) through speakers. Shit's hilarious since my room is foggy due to the vaperino.

Edit: Now I'm using arab rap music 




 This is my most vivid lucid dream I've ever had, and it's a bit long but I hope you stick along for the ride. I usually induce lucid dreaming by meditating before I sleep or sleeping with my arms at my sides repeating mantras and shit. This was by far my most successful lucid dream ever. Usually I just fall into sleep paralysis, which I'm also cool with, but this was way different. The dream felt like it spanned a year, but there were random patches in it and time skipped a lot. Well here goes.

I woke up in a cabin of sorts, like a mini hotel room. When I looked out of the window I saw stars. A lot of stars. I got up and walked over to the mirror. What I saw was a older version of myself. It looked like me, but aged ten years (right now I'm 17). 

Then, I heard a knocking on the door. I was startled to say the least. A raspy voice addressed me with "Mr." and my last name, very formally. When I opened the door I was greeted by one oft he cantina aliens from Star Wars (the cute ones that play the catchy song). He told me the train would arrive in the seventh dimension in three days after making a few stops. He said that I would have a business conference to attend. It was then I realized I was dressed fairly corporate casually with a dress shirt and khakis. I was really confused but I obliged and said okay.

When he left I exited the cabin and went down the hall until I found another door. When I opened it I was greeted by a large congregation area. There were a bunch of people talking, more cantina aliens, and other confusing aliens. Shuffling through the crowd I bumped into somebody. After apologizing profusely I realized it was a girl I knocked down. She smiled and said it was okay. She was absolutely beautiful and I was awe struck in all honesty. She had black hair and eyes like mine, almost hazel but brownish. She was dressed in casual clothes and had a sun hat on. I noticed a large camera in her hands.

I asked if she was alright and instead of answering the question she said, "No, I'm Alice, what's your name?" I told her my name and she said we should have coffee later. 

I don't remember having coffee, but I remember sitting on one of the benches in the area we were before. She told me she was taking a college art course and that her assignment was to take pictures of other dimensions. It was the I looked at the surroundings that were around the train. 

White. It was **vibrant** white, and there were trees of all different colors all around us. Blue, red, yellow. Every color of the rainbow. I remember this so clearly in my mind still. It was so fucking beautiful. She stood up and started taking pictures. Then, she smiled and asked me if I thought it was beautiful.

I was awe struck and said of course. She then asked me what I did for a living. I told her I was on my way to a business meeting in the seventh dimension. She frowned, and said that was boring. Then, she asked if I wanted to tag along with her. I remember thinking, "Screw it, it's my dream." and said yes.

Things got hazy after that, and I remember going to Mars, where it looked similar to Cowboy Bebop Mars. Then I only remember going to a strange cave dimension, because when we were there she got a call about something. Her cheery expression turned to a worried expression and she quickly hung up after agreeing with whoever was on the phone. 

After that, she said she had to go and said sorry. I asked her why and what was wrong. She told me that she was sorry and didn't get back on the train. I was very sad and confused after that, afterall I was in love. Or at least it felt like I was, and that was scary for me. 

Things got hazy again and I remember it was like a few years passed. I was at my grandpa's farm again, where I lived before my current house, but there were more futuristic cars. I was running an estate sale (when people go through a dead person's house and buy stuff) for the family. 

Then I saw her again. She walked up to the deck, wearing the same sun hat as before. I walked outside and walked up to her. She almost jumped and hugged me. I asked her how she was doing and if she wanted to catch up. She obliged and the next day we met up at my house. Or at least where my house is now, but it was an apartment complex. 

When she showed up I asked her how her art was doing and her expression faded. Then she told me something about how she had to be a prostitute for money and that all of those years ago she got a call about prostitute stuff. I don't remember the details but I remember asking her if she wanted to run away or stay with me. She looked up at me and smiled, but started to tear up a bit. 

She said she had to go and couldn't be with me. This was crushing and I felt terrible. I asked if she wanted to spend the night for one last night. 

After that all I remember was holding her in a dark apartment before waking up to my alarm, crying. It was so scary to me. I've never had a dream so real. It was the most real dream I've ever had. 




 Watched everything that's out so far. Needless to say, I need to watch shows and not not watch them if they have a weird title. It's like SAO but with less plot armor and more in depth shit. I mean there's still harem bullshit, but whatever.  




 Oh yeah I got 100 GB free now 




 There was at least 26~ GB of really obscure and really really hardcore BDSM stuff 




 So my current computer used to be my grandpa's, and to free up some hard drive space I decided to delete his user. Well I decided to dig through his old user and found some weird porn. Next time I see him it's gonna be hard to look him in the eyes.  




 I personally think this gun is fucking adorable 




 Your beard is very woodsman-y 




 You need a kit list of some sort 




 Weird lol 




 Yeah I typed it but it didn't show up lol 




  \_()_/ 




 Oh I know I'm not getting anything out of it. If you think taking that argument really does anything, it doesn't.  




 Haha wow I'm cameron and I can't make a come back comment that makes sense or has proper capitlization or punctuation. 




 Oh yeah I prefer tactical pants more than BDU's 




 Ha ha wow I'm Cameron, I'm gonna add random compliments on every post I see for upvotes and not provide any help to anybody. 




 Those pants look like the ones you get at Kohls or Walmart that imitate real camo but aren't true BDU's.  




 Revision Wolfspider deluxe goggles. Never fog.  




 Holy fuck dude I read that comment and laughed out loud in class. I didn't even realize it was you lol 




 It's been done, and people would probably be more interested if you were more professional with this post 




 All of your problems, that is 




 Nobody cares about your problems cameron 




 You'd do this to everybody because nobody likes you  




 CRAAAAAWWWWLING IN MY SKIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN 




 I run off two pots of coffee and a bowl of ramen a day baby 




 I don't eat lunch lol 




 Nah I told them. They just said, "Nah whatever inside mang" 




 They thought I did it for the joy of killing them. I just wanted to see if there was something in the nest. 




 Yeah, that's the funny part 




 I knocked down a bird nest full of eggs.

 On the Cowboy Bebop Wiki it does explain that Spike's fighting style was supposed to emulate Bruce Lee's exact fighting style. What is it, Jeet Kune Do, something like that. So it looks a lot like a Bruce Lee fight scene, but it doesn't copy one in any way. 




 This is a question that can be answered on /r/airsoft. We are just a subsidiary chat sub. 




 Oh yeah, that's even funnier 




 Whoa look out guys cameron is so cool and edgy and goes on 4chan. Pay attention to him. 




 Lol this happened to your MP9 right? 




 That would be awesome. I'm considering one, but there are barely any decent reviews of it.  




 Now I'm sad 




 Well I guess you'd be the right guy to ask, how do TM PSG-1's preform stock? 




 Did you, uh, misspell a_irsoft there champ? 




 Lol 




 Is that wrapping paper tied to your barrel?  
Also you need a description.  




 Jui jitsu, karate, blah blah blah 




 Needs a description 




 Or fencing or kendo. Combat. 




 Ew 




 Airsoft is combat. Just because people don't die, doesn't mean it's not combat.  




 Yeah, just look above at the other guy arguing that and being wrong 




 Close enough 




 I have an unorthodox handguard lol 




 Bodgeups is Buzzfeed. Breaking news. 




 Technically it's still combat though  




 I just thought the title was more obvious 




 I mean, prolly 




 Ew hunter camo 




 *did the amputee 




 It's really cool that retailers are leaning towards making more unique guns, and people are making unique loadouts 




 Lol this is around when Joan Rivers died  




 It's probably my favorite gun in Battlefield 4 and having an airsoft counterpart in my collection would be really neat.  




 Oh that's nice. Now you just have to get the ASG CZ 805 right? 




 Yeah at this point I was just stretching it out and thinking "Fuck it man at least I was kind of right" lol 




 Yeah they're really cool and I've been really really tempted to get one lately. 




 Ah there it is. Watched that video awhile back when I was considering the EL AK-74. That was a good video.  




 What? 




 Nah isn't ringing a bell. Weird. 




 Do you have an airsoft channel on YouTube? I've seen your face before somewhere and I can't put my finger on ot 




 Whoa, this is pretty awesome 




 Fuck I knew that, I'm out of it and in school lol. I do have to disagree on the naming thing though. Not really codsoftery at all 




 Well I never realized it was Mk18 like how the SCAR-L is the Mk.17 




 I sound out the acronym like "em-kay-18" yeah. If you say it as "Mark" then it would make sense, but I'd assume a lot of people say it like that lol 




 \Decorative pullback thing

 He's dissolved into full creepy furry and gave up on airsoft for awhile I think 




 It's in the description lol 




 I'm more bugged about how he said "A MK18" instead of "An MK18."  
In this instance "M" isn't a vowel of course, but is sounded out like a vowel so that needs to be "An" instead of "A." 

Reading the title in my head hurt a bit  




 I'm probably not even going to get this or consider it, but this is still really awesome 




 PMC's don't wear camo. This is more like random gear put on and trying to do a PMC loadout.  




 I have XM8. I love XM8. I'm not Jarek. 




 B-29 best girl 




 *Oh you* 




 k bb 




 :( 




 How's the PSG? 




 Yui best blart 




 Makes sense, he's a fire demon 














 What are periods? 




 Ew, was that "xD" genuine? 




 Yeah, it'd be one thing if he had a valid argument, or at least knew how to express it. He's just stupid. 




 Did the thought *penetrate* your mind? 




 I'm all about cyberpunk and cool future stuff, but you're acting autistic 




 Jew 




 And also Utauyo Miracle by Houkago Tea Time lol 




 lol 




 It's really called Another? wat? 




 Sauce? 




 Sometimes I take the tobacco out of cigarettes and fill it with whatever I want to smoke 




 The animation quality is cool and stuff, but I remember watching it before I knew what hentai was and going, "Wait where the fuck is this going?" 




 Oh fuck this music video man 




 Alright. Cool cool.  




 I understand everything you're saying and agree for the most part. I think it's just fucked up to blow it in kids faces or around kids. Also it's douchey 




 Exactly what I said. I don't know how to go much simpler  




 People don't know the effects of it or what's in it exactly either, so why risk anything? 




 I'm pretty sure plenty of studies have been done about the negative effects of secondhand smoke. Also most of those studies are true. 




 Nice. I've heard great things about the WE  




 WE or the crappy AIM one? 




 ye 




 Nothing major besides my charging handle doesn't go all the way back because it's broken a little 




 If's a good feeling rifle 




 Don't really know how to explain, but it shoots far enough for me to play effectively 




 Meh, getting a G36k next 




 It's bretty good 




 TSD is the same as SRC 




 Top to bottom,  
JG G3  
SRC XM8  
Galaxy MP5k  














 I did, but now I don't lol 




 D A N K  B U I L D S 




 I run into so many things with my car. I'm surprised I haven't wrecked it.  




 Wait, what's Imgur? 




 Yeah same here. I check all major airsoft retailers so much that I know exactly when they add new products, check /r/airsoft every fifteen minutes, and window shop like a mad man. 




 Only fields closest to me is a sketchy CQB place an hour up north and an outdoor field an hour and a half away in Illinois, so I'm also at a loss there 




 No, I've been really interested with cyberpunk stuff lately and watched all of Psycho Pass this weekend. I'm finishing Shingatsu wa Kimi no Uso this week 




 After checking out a post on /r/airsoft, something about what you do when you aren't chairsofting or airsofting I realized I do nothing but browse dank memes and watch anime. 

Well. Shit.  




 Watch anime. Browse dank memes. Get high.  
Edit: I accept these downvotes with open arms 




 Oh oops I forgot, this is /r/creepyhallsandcrawlspaces  




 Here's the whole album, http://imgur.com/a/exlH6 




 The original poster on the airsoft sub said something about owning or it's converted into an airsoft field 




 I mean, if there's a subreddit there's a way? 




 *Nice.*

I hate the uber tactical too many rails "A3" receiver, but on [my AUG] (http://i.imgur.com/KRMijZ7.jpg) I just have the flat top rail.  




 Little late here and I was just browsing some old posts, but there's nothing wrong with the outer barrel. The handguard was wobbly and loose and I wanted to ditch it. 

[The outer barrel is completely intact underneath the shemagh actually.] (http://i.imgur.com/bBm7WBx.jpg) 




 Haha good idea. Have you considered picking up a railed receiver and just putting the marui barrel in it?  




 I'm really digging the AUG. The way you have it set up is pretty great.  




 Without his stickies it would be the same. I wasn't saying without his posts it would be the same, because it definitely wouldn't be. 
























 Lol that gun is fucked 




 A fuck ton of girls like a single guy and the guy is indifferent and uncomfortable about it all the time like it isn't happening 




 Oh you were wondering what it was.  
Butts n' tits and tits n' butts 




 Oh yeah. Harem stuff too lol 




 It's pretty much SAO with more fan service and more background on how the main character grows. 




 Yeah it's pretty great lol  
People usually call is DanMachi for short though 




 [Kek] (http://i.imgur.com/Rcqiu3C.gif) 




 It's a pretty entertaining show to keep up with.  









 Saw that and shit my pants. Already posted it in the skype chat poser. 

I really fucking want it. 




 I'm just gonna settle with the plastic one to fit my budget for now and to review.  




 \\_()_/ 




 I mean, it can 




 Oh I like regular grips too lol

I just like shooting thumb over bore because it's relatively universal and works well. 




 Depending on arm length and position of the grip? Length of the rifle? 

Shooting thumb over bore provides maneuverability without a grip and works for multiple lengths of rifles 




 I feel like jumping on the opportunity and doing a review will generate me a poop ton of views 




 I'm ordering some pouches and shit, just a bunch of essentials and I have enough left for a CYMA M870, some shells, and a scabbard.

I feel like if I put up a review of it a lot of people will watch it also.  
Thoughts? 




 k bb I got osu waiting at home 3 xoxo 




 REEEEEEE~ 




 Just make a joke about OSU lol
 




 yee 









 feelsbadman 




 You talked to it and then cried to it? 




 Shooting thumb over bore looks a little silly, but it makes maneuvering easier and helps with aiming.  




 Tell your body pillow about it 




 Oh lol 




 Free Galaxy MP5k. All I had to do was reinstall the wiring, new motor, and pry out a BB from the nozzle.  




 All of the bad pictures don't have eye raping filters and all of the good pictures do. 




 Yeah it's all pretty listenable 




 I thought coldsteel trainers were santoprene?

Which is like rubbery? 




 Yeah I love me some good ska rock 




 Oh lol 




 What about a regular T1 riser that's the same height? 




 It's fake and rubber dude 




 The whole thing looks flawless, and then the riser is just an eyesore. 




 Weird 




 0/10 no hentai 




 *This is my kind of gun* 




 Lol what time zone are you even in? 




 I love these videos  




 Dude nuh uh  




 Where I work there's all waitresses but they all suck  




 Uh, no links anywhere? 




 I can't find a way to do that. My chrome isn't giving me the option. 




 Person who makes salads, *duh.* 




 Oh god it's so grainy 




 Airsoft is banned in Australia, that'd be an easy way to get your stuff taken away 




 74M 




 K 




 ayy  




 *You wanna see these hands?* 









 Cool cool man. We're just a chat sub that's kind of a subsidiary to the main /r/airsoft sub.  




 Yeah they deserve it. They rock. 




 This was really well put together. Thanks for the great video. 




 I thought you meant real knife lol 




 Like /r/mallninjashit style knife or just a nice knife? 




 Yeah seeing a Japanese dude with an afro was pretty great lol 




 Oh that makes sense. Thanks for clearing that up.  




 Does kuundere just mean spacey and shit?  
Like Mashiro from Sakurasou? 









 Yeah good point.  




 I know lol. Just adding that because I didn't want to seem like a total dick. Maybe like, a partial dick.  




 Oh I wasn't talking about the tent thing. That has meaning behind it and you explained it lol. I was talking about the random pew pews or whatever 




 k 




 Oh lol.

Oreimo is good but a little weird.  




 I feel like this is a joke because I didn't much care for either show.  




 The paint jobs are cool but the random writing is kind of ugly 




 This reminds me of the time I gave a friend a sugar pill and told him it was ecstasy.  




 But you'd agree that an RATech'd out WE is better than a stock GHK right? 




 I need to stop resurrecting this laptop and get a PC lol 




 Okay then 




 Yeah these glasses are way more comfortable to me than my old ones 




 Oh my jimmies weren't rustled, I just explained lol 




 Sickles. 




 One time I saw a picture of a Gameboy Advance on one of their displays. Like, with the batteries and stuff.  




 Memes 




 Pepe sun? 




 I'll do it later, because I'm tempted lol 




 My computer is no longer kill. No more using IPad for me.  
Yusssssss 




 It's annoying as shit and it's not mine 




 That's a good tip.  
Also, I love my Condor MOPC to pieces. Definitely getting a other for my next loadout. 




 Condor MOPC is a cheap alternative. If you get the pouches right then it wouldn't look too different. 









 Oopsy, okay. Thanks for the chill message 




 I've always had a thing for NSR rail systems.  
I need to pick one up some day. 




 When my hair's like this I use glasses, longer hair/airsoft is contacts. 




 Then why recommend it for entry level GBBR users? 




 Better than a stock GHK 




 Yep.  
GHKWEWA.  

I would recommend WE and then getting all RATech parts though. 




 I'm 90% sure it's a unique system 









 Material and gas efficiency. Not a WA design, WE is better than WA 




 Is overpriced 




 He's wrong on most of that stuff 




 Yeah I've been doing this since 4th or 5th hour lol  




 Yeah thanks, that was actually pretty reasonable and was a good distraction for class lol. Usually arguments on reddit go to poo, so this was a breath of fresh air  




 Where's the other parenthesis I'm confused 




 Well there we are. Also, I wasn't saying KJW GBBR's were bad in any way, just saying that for the money he'd probably looking for a WE.  




 I can somewhat agree with this, but what OP is looking for is probably a WE M4 Open Bolt.  




 I was planning on either g-hopping and playing until the internals took a shit, or getting an HPA engine, g-hop, and wide bore combo.  




 WE's last pretty long stock and are more affordable than KJW M4's. They also have more upgrade options down the road, and have better quality control as of late. Plus, as the one guy said, the reason you see bad reviews is because more people buy them.

If more people buy something there'll be way more reviews of it.  




 WE doesn't break after a bag of BB's, that doesn't even make sense 




 Yeah WE has way more high quality aftermarket parts.  




 Still, why would you wear the bag like that lol  
It would be terrible trying to raise your weapon to aim 




 But with WE the quality control has gone up and there's plenty of good aftermarket parts that you can use to upgrade and make it better than a KJW M4?

As far as I know, there aren't as many decent aftermarket upgrades for the KJW as there is more for the WE. I'd take a stock WE Open Bolt M4 and an NPAS for like 300 or so with the option of upgrading with better parts than a stock KJW M4 for 375 or so. 

Also, WE mags are cheaper and aren't too hard to fix if they're leaking.  




 WE M4, more mags, RATech parts 




 You just seem to have a shit attitude and he was posting here because he knew he'd get the answer he wanted and it's not a bother? 




 DAE SIDEBAR GUISE GOSH 




 Link isn't working for me.  
Otherwise, how does it shoot stock? I've been looking into getting/building a DMR and I've been eye balling this gun.

Do you think I could get away with just a new spring and g-hopping it or what? 




 /r/theydidthemath 




 You thought changing the aesthetics of a gun made it shoot further?  
Are you LevelCap or something?  




 It'd look really cool if you used some tan goggles 




 This gun just sounds so terrible just by the words SRC and GBBR together 




 wat 




 I like the short one. If a sale comes along I'm very tempted to get one. 




 Oh don't pull that. UMP-45's are nice and it's hard to see how militia members could get theirs hands on them. It just doesn't fit the look and you know that too. 




 I was joking. *Gosh.* 




 Airsoft-SJW is a term that doesn't even make sense. Other than that I agree the hive mind is bullshit and I was just pointing something out. 




 His gear is too nice looking and the gun is wrong? 




 Le cumbut masheen DMR guise 




 Exactly. I wasn't saying his gear was bad or being a dick about it. Just stating what I saw really. 




 But they can't afford UMP-45's nor do they have accessibility to any 




 I really like it, I was just pointing out that it isn't specific to anything.   Just random gear is all. 




 So I was right 




 You need a kit list, and also this just seems like random gear and a Kenyan flag. 




 Oh yeah I agree the second is better than the first 




 I just fixed it. Now I'm sad. 




 7.62 milimeter. **Full. Metal. Jacket.** 




 Oh yeah dude I was gonna ask if you wanted to go see it in theater or some shit 




 I saw the scene with Chris Pratt going through the woods on a motorcycle with velociraptor bros and shit my pants 




 I knew about it and didn't get too excited until I saw one of the trailers while waiting to watch a YouTube video.

Needless to say I'm going to be checking for torrents every day now or going to see it with a friend. I can't miss Chris Pratt being bros with velociraptors. 




 *Neither did I* 




 Partially 




 Lol that username 




 Or a Colt C7 




 Aye 
























 I saw all of the original movies and I get the whole Engrish joke. I just don't remember someone talking like that I guess. 




 Yeah, like the episode of Cowboy Bebop where the dude has tits 




 Meh, take more time on it and use thinner strands. 




 I don't understand the title, but this is definitely going in my webm folder 




 It was a long shot, yeah lol 




 I think it's a chick. The username has "esmerelda" in it. Also she posted to a hair dye subreddit of sorts with a picture of herself 




 I searched incognito so it wouldn't go into related searches and bug me 




 What about that original post lol 




 I just looked one up on Amazon and it was like, 35 for a pillow and 35 for a case.  




 I'm in a cold basement and when I blow vapor in my hands it feels like the air around me. It's about 60 degrees Fahrenheit in the basement and 80 degrees Fahrenheit upstairs. The vapor feels colder in a warm environment to me than say, me sitting in my chair right now doing it in the basement.  




 Maybe even two. 




 ring-off 




 Oh yeah the same happens when I watch subbed anime too. Like the creepy dude who almost rapes Sinon in SAO two is the same voice as Izaya from Durarara 




 He's still genuinely asking an airsoft related question. He could have asked something like this in a different format on /r/airsoft 




 Buy a body pillow 




 This is a question that can be answered on /r/airsoft 




 Yeah I remembered that one too lol 




 I noticed that too. There's a sort of comedic effect to it that kept it kind of light, but it sounded really genuine.  




 Yeah, Rittsu was the same voice as Kirito's little sister in SAO. I picked it up right away and it bugged me. 




 The voices were similar in the dub, but I've watched a lot of dubbed anime before watching the English dub of K-ON and I could pick out who all of the voice actors were 




 lol meep likes RWBY still 




 3edgy5me just like cameron 




 Yeah there's some nice looking ones on Evike. 




 He could probably pick up a pair of LBX Combat Pants in Glacier Grey and they'd work well 




 Did you FAL in love?  
I FAL in love with my FAL. 




 No G3's  
:'^( 




 Yeah, that'd be cool to do on a CYMA M870 




 What? I'm not him 




 Oh yeah, I'll definitely get shit on for my choice but it'll be fun and unique for me 




 Well it's not gonna be anything special by any means, but definitely unorthodox.  




 Whoa, what shotgun is that? That's pretty snazzy. 




 Too bad they're so rare and expensive. Otherwise I'd pick one up and get a stock. 




 *It's a small world after all. It's a small world after all.  
It's a small world after all. It's a small, small world* 




 45 minute detention for calling a teacher "Dude" 




 My new sidearms are too eccentric to keep out of a collection picture, so of course I gotta wait lol 




 Nah I'll wait lol 




 Sounds cool. I've never had any sidearms besides using my MP5k once or twice. I've never had a use for one, but the field I'm gonna start going to is gonna require one for close encounters which kind of sucks. 




 I got as many rifles as this guy and an SMG but I feel like I need some pistols to balance it out. 




 I should get around to posting my full collection some day, but I think I'll wait until I get some pistols. 




 Oh my god it's the fucking turkey from Aqua Teen Hunger Force.  
I'm gonna miss that show. 




 **YEAH WE'RE COOL KIDS** 




 Don't forget his magical plot armor power that he uses to defeat enemies more powerful than him! 




 YEAH WE'RE COOL KIDS. 




 Fuck bandwagons. This isn't even a full picture of a gun.  




 Idk but it's the whole gun. The description says it's based off of a VFC 417. 




 What?  
This is the whole gun and everything lol 




 Oh god, right during my HK buzz and I can't get it. I really hope they release another version that isn't limited edition and more affordable. This is so beautiful. 




 Catbrains said this is a test patch 




 Nah it works 




 It was expected lol 




 ayy lmao 




 Who cares 




 Well mixing black gear with tan based camouflages always looks beginnerish or novice. If he had a tan or OD vest the loadout would look at more professional and experienced.  




 Try some better external lighting and use the camera without the flash to get better pictures. Also tan and multicam a little less beginnerish.  




 Aww yeah I love Fox Stevenson.  




 Then ask Vorperoni 




 Ask good ol' Mr.Catbrains 




 I'm not sure on supply, that's all /u/Catbrains' department 














 I literally checked my inbox just now and thought, "Imma go check the mail" and I got it 




 *Nice.* 




 Oh okay. So yay? I still get patch? 




 It'd look cool without the triforce just randomly stuck on there 




 RemindMe! 2 days 




 Idk talk to Catbrains sempai 




 I'll probably get mine tomorrow. I'll post a pic bb 




 Ah. Makes sense lol 




 It's pretty spot on for what it's like for me.  
There were some parts that went overboard with the "muh triggerings" but they did do good with the respect that there's a lot of specific things that can trigger it.  




 I expected this to be gruesome or something lol  
Not really NSFW 




 I really wanted one of the /r/airsoft patches but it all happened too fast for me to get the money lol.  
I can't wait to get my /r/a_irsoft patch though so that'll be fun. 




 I think there were a few spots where the PTSD factor is shotty, but the show did a wonderful job capturing what PTSD is like as a whole and the daily struggles of it.  




 Ha. Well /r/sinonassonline sounds like your knack Reascr.  




 Oh that makes a lot more sense. It's a nice touch (the counter, that is), and I guess if you leave it in all of your videos it'll make more sense or seem consistent. I just thought it was a little confusing. 

I think it'd look a lot more fluid if you left it un-grainy, but again if you do that consistently in your videos then viewers would become accustomed to it.  




 I just thought it was overall pretty blurry and grainy. What kind of camera are you using?

Also the time counter thing was odd. 




 Oh, keep it up, make videos, and all of that good stuff. Have fun.

Just saying there's definitely room to improve. Like the footage quality isn't the best and the music overpowers the game volume a bit.  




 Nobody else does considering the downvotes. 




 Ew.  
Overpowering music, bad footage quality.  




 Aaaaaand now I want to paint my L96 black, put a silencer on it, get a WE TT-33, and get a Death Gun mask. 

Yes I'm aware that Death Gun doesn't use an L96 or a TT-33, but close enough.  




 We should have an official night and add more mods to it 




 It's my favorite chinese cartoon 




 Yee 




 Everyone pretty much joins and makes an account, and adds videos to the queue. It's pretty dank. http://instasync.com/r/A_irsoft 




 That's two posts lol 




 Huh? 









 I don't see a need for overwhelming FPS if I have a good barrel set up and hop up set up.  




 I too, have a [tactical doge.] (http://i.imgur.com/7kNagaU.jpg) 




 Nah 




 Lol I wonder why people are downvoting you 




 Okay lol. You said it was the E above and someone else said it was the E but then someone said it was the standard.

Alright, now I know what it is lol 




 It's good but very underwhelming. 




 Yeah I learned. G36E.  




 Yeah lol.  

Still pissed me off how in the new movie the kid just lugs around a fucking M249 somehow. 




 Oh, that's pretty rough lol 




 Nah it's because it's HTC 




 It's regarded as one of the greatest entry level guns and a great clone. 




 Did the soldiers use AK's and CZ-75's?  
I paid attention to the guns more in the new movie and the only thing that bugged me was the kid carrying a fucking M249 everywhere. 




 ayy dank cheeki breeki may mays  




 Dank may mays? 




 I wasn't trying to greentext, just quote what I was saying lol 




 I thought most slavboos used cheeki breeki Russian guns 




 fuckin redditers man 




 Thanks 




 Yeah I saw the initial downvote and thought, "Well, alrighty then" 




 You said slav. I thought most slavboos used cheeki breeki Russian guns. 




 Catbrains explained lol 




 Meh 




 Meh it's the long one which is the one I like lol 




 Yep. I plan on ghopping it or something along the road 




 I was actually thinking of picking up an MP7 or the VFC GBB UMP to get another needed SMG in there lol

As for the XM8, it's good but isn't what I was expecting. It shoots about as far as my AIM Top M4. About far enough to hit what I want, but pretty underwhelming. 




 I have a friend who's out of the sport and has a G36c he's selling. I tempted to pick it up.  




 Nice. You should pick up a TT-33 or a Makarov. 




 In the description, baby 




 I got around to getting a G36, and decided on my favorite variant. Description's in the album.

Guns,  
JG G36k  
JG G3  
Galaxy MP5k  
SRC XM8 









 lolwut  
Well if I had your username I'd invite you 




 And a skype chat 




 Being wrong about something is the first step to being kind of right about something 




 That AK is probably a CYMA rebrand, just like how the IGOR is a shitty ST rebrand 




 lolwat x 10^23 




 lolwat 




 Ah. The almost VSS.  




 Oh. I don't like how it's drawn and there's like six episodes of flying and talking between three episode fights. 

Otherwise I like it more than Naruto by far and I'm cool with it. 




 Naruto?  
It's the gateway show most people who don't watch a lot of anime watch. I don't like how it's drawn, the characters are all so fucking annoying, it attracts retards, overrated as hell, repetitive long fights, terrible character development, and there's the godawful flashbacks.  




 Most people use the filler thing as a beginning argument but have plenty of other valid reasons to hate it. 

That's what I meant. 




 Not at all. I have plenty of reasons for hating both shows besides that. 




 Nope totally stock, came with that 




 That there is the Echo 1 SOF 2, a rebrand of the JG FAL Carbine.  
The only difference is a Madbull barrel, Echo 1 motor, and Madbull bucking.

In its' prime it shot true and it was a pleasure to field. Only problem was I had to fix the motor height.  




 Something of the sort lol 




 Only reason I've really really kept it is that I really want to P* it some day 




 Oh it's a dead gun now. Just a prop.  
Trigger kind of came out with the gearbox. 




 *Oh of course.* 




 All I need is the cool hat and olive drab short-shorts 




 [Oh yeah baby.] (http://i.imgur.com/LAkBjJq.jpg) 




 A can of Krylon and some time can do wonders 




 41% of Naruto is filler.  
That's almost half of the show lol

Also these downvotes are hilarious 




 Wrong post format.  
Also that gun is fucked. 


































 Nice Steins;Gate reference username.  




 A gun rack would look better 




 Hey I got a hat like that lol 




 Alright boys this is a trial run of our first Instasynch night. 
Instasynch is a neat little site where there's a chatroom, and a video player. Everybody contributes to the video queue and votes on which videos to skip or to pass. 

Instasynch night will begin 7:00 PM CT (UTC-06:00) and end when everyone's bored. It'll be hosted in this room, http://instasync.com/r/A_irsoft.

Only rules are,  
1. Enough dank memes  
2. No spam (I guess?)

The playlist will remain locked until 7:00 PM CT 




 I'd say it takes a good balance of gear (armor, pouches, etc.) like any loadout.  




 I'd say hot and it can either look good or horrible, like hookers.  




 srry vorpie sempie 




 Nothing with pandas data analysis, didn't do any of those assignments in the class lol 




 Ayy the only coding I know kind of 




 Do the sites you listed ship to the US? 




 1. Where is it available.  
2. Will it be released to US retailers like Evike and Airsoft GI  
Those are my main two questions. Otherwise it's nice to see more unique and awesome guns coming to the GBBR world, and it's nice to see you guys at WE stepping it up. 




 Ew KWA

 I Googled it because I thought that I was wrong and thought I heard it wrong the whole movie lol 




 It's Indominus lol  
Why'd I get downvoted lol 




 So the trick is not asking them to play OSU? 




 Nah he landed a date. The trick was no OSU.  




 Oh jeez, sorry lol 




 Are you selling the VFC 417 and the TM 417?  
The description says that there's a TM 417, but the album says it's a VFC 417.  




 You mean the "almost honey badger". 




 Being a connoisseur of the HK variety, I do respect that you have two G36's at least.  




 I love how real it seemed, because they didn't use music in the whole movie. Only the opening scene and the credits.  




 Weezer  
Weab shit  
Parker (decent Korean rapper guy)  
KC4K  
Modigs  
Madeon  
Alex Skrindo

Some of my favorite stuff off the top of my head. 




 THANKS XYSTED THANKS 




 [HK IS LOVE. HK IS LIFE] (http://i.imgur.com/Pmq1ccR.jpg) 




 Uh, which one? 




 So, a UK retailer or a retailer that ships to the UK?  




 He seems like a really down to earth and genuine dude 




 Oh yeaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh. ^^^^What? 




 Oh yeah same here. His interesting play style, efficiency with GBBR's, and good editing are a great combo.  




 I'm happy I saw a StoopsMan video here. He makes really good content, I just wish he made more.  




 Uh-whe-what? 




 Okay so 7:00 PM central time. I don't know universal time lol 




 THANKS XYSTED THANKS 




 I was wondering about the threads on the [Lonex M4 receiver] (http://www.evike.com/products/51385/) and I was wondering if it's automatically compatible with [Noveske NSR rail system.] (http://www.evike.com/products/43521/)

I was digging around online but I couldn't find any information. I saw [this] (http://www.evike.com/products/48636/) and was wondering if I had to buy that, or if I could just screw the rail system on the gun. Any help would be awesome. 




 I feel like the put that power in the series, and the harem power to kind of make fun of regular mainstream shows. 




 Probably, or somehow Bell is going to use his magical plot armor power. 




 Yep, let's say Thursday at... 7:00 PM or 8:00 PM whatever time zone I'm in or yours since it's the same? What is it, central time? 




 I mean, *probably* 









 I wish we spent more time in British Colombia, but cruises are always a pain in the ass because of how you have to get back to the ship and shit. I'd love to go back though some time 




 Sounds pretty cool mang 




 I mean not to sound like a weab, but the Japanese-y part with the stepping stones and creek and azalea trees was probably my favorite part.  




 Sounds cool. I went to Butchart Gardens which was really cool.  




 I loved British Columbia when I went.  




 Good starting point. 




 Take one more loadout picture with the operator beard. Then, you can put it in a frame and set it on your nightstand, singing longingly to it every night. 




 Ayy that'll work 




 There's like, 2 lol 




 Thursday nights would be perfect. Disregard gay smiley face 




 I'm not sure, I work Saturday and Sunday 




 Didn't see this post sorry lol

Should I just keep it open all the time? 




 *I'm gonna need a long gun-erm I mean a CQB gun with a bipod* 




 *I need a long gun* 




 *It's time to blow this scene...*  
*Right?* 




 I like the bipod that doesn't really have a practical use on a CQB oriented assault rifle.  




 TAR-21's aren't long. I mean, if you say "Oh it's bullpup so the barrel is long" then that kind of makes sense, but overall length of the gun isn't long. 




 I'm digging everything and I really dig compact ghillies like that. The only thing that kind of bugs me is how it's hunter camo. 




 Those scopes are sex. I saw one on the limited edition G28 that Umarex is selling. Looks slick, and it'd probably look sick on your 417. 




 I'm 17 and I'm only 5'5". I feel like I should be the one in your position. 




 Description please. 




 Aww yeah them /r/A_irsoft patches.  




 *Whoa* 




 Oh that's really interesting, thanks for clearing it up lol 




 ***Okay 3, 2, 1- Let's jam.*** 




 Ah 




 *I think it's time we blow this scene...* 




 Like keyboard cleaning spray? 




 Haven't you seen his turtle burger video? 




 On Evike and I think ASGI you can find RATech (I recommend RATech) and other manufacturers of NPAS systems which can be used to lower FPS.   




 Just looks like inconsistent colors, laziness with parts or carelessness, and an average long suppressor for the "DAE DMR?" look.  
It's a nice gun but by no means is it unique.  




 Good point. This is the first AR I've seen in awhile 




 Seems pretty average, rather than eccentric. 




 Prolly 




 By the end of my lifetime I hope that there's a VR first person shooter like in SAO 




 Oh yeah definitely. I'm curious to see what they'll implement to make the new game stand out of the crowd. It's gonna be hard.  




 I agree with the first sentiment, but I feel like it still sort of applies to the second game too. Far less so than the first, but it's still a big factor to the game's success at the time.  




 BUT DAE PC GUISE HALF LIFE 3 HALF LIFE 3 IS THE BEST GAMEME EVERR AND PC GUAIEIS KHLWEwU BvFdXCXwshJL  




 CRYEE LMAO 




 Oh I gotcha 




 I have a caramel custard flavored juice from White Label Juice. I know it has Diacetyl in it because they say there is. I'm seeing a lot of people saying they love diacetyl. Can you shed some light on what the diacetyl taste is when I vape it? I don't understand. 




 I feel like I've seen a scene from a show about vampires with a similar name and I swear there was nudity. Weird. 




 I feel like I know what show you're talking about.  
Is that the one with unnecessary nude loli tits? 




 Why thank you, it's my oldest and trustiest. 




 I've played milsim with full Condor gear and it held its own.  




 Condor gear lasts a long time, it's affordable, and it works very well for airsoft use. Before my Condor MOPC I used a Condor Recon Chest Rig for two or three years. Condor Gear lasts a long time and anyone who calls it lower quality is kind of elitist.  
It's not the highest quality, but it certainly isn't lower quality by any means.  




 Barrel? 




 Looks like it'd make a good sidearm to my [SPACE AUG.] (http://i.imgur.com/IUYQUFy.jpg) 




 It's not even a matter of tone, you just don't say stuff like that and keep it to yourself. People with Aspergers do stuff like that  




  That's really rude to just say stuff like that out loud when someone goes out of their way to invite you to do something.

 




 I have, this comment is just over the top 




 Even when I first invited you said just said stuff along the lines of,  
"Oh I guess I'll see it even though it looks like a pile of shit" or "Looks cool even though they'll mess it up"

That's really rude to just say stuff like that out loud when someone goes out of their way to invite you to do something. 




 Nah idk about that. He's just gotta be more positive and do more 




 Because you would've given it shit the whole time 




 Fuck it. /u/derpmurderpunch.

You gotta live a rose colored life mang. You houtarou-esque sonuvabich.  




 Yeah I won't say his username because he browses here, but he said something about the books and how the movie is gonna be shit for some reason. I feel like he's got depressive realism really bad because lately he's just turned into a cunt looking only at the bad things in everything. 




 I wanted to see it with a friend this Friday, but he would've made fun of it the whole time so I'm just going to wait until a decent torrent comes up. 




 Oh for fucks sake, I remember now 
























 It's dead now lol 




 Awww sheeeeit 




 A lot of people don't think it lol 




 Lol you're a teen

 XM8 best fish gun. Plebeian.

 I just don't see how it's a big deal or why small subreddits would matter. 




 Awww why are we going private :'^( 




 What? 




 Uh.  
K. 




 wat.  
You made the subreddit? 




 Our autistic message must be spread.  
This will not do. 




 Pls no 




 Uh, come again?  
Use an airsoft gun as a fish tank?  
Buy fish tank and use as airsoft gun?  
Buy fish tank and use as real tank? 




 \Denial 




 I like HK guns because they have a certain style, new and old, that appeal to me. 

I like the G36 platform because of how the magazine looks. I also think the handguards are a good combo with the stock. Just look good together to me.

I like the look of G3 rifles because of the slim look of the handguard paired with the large 7.62 magazine. I think they pair well together.

I like the MP5k and MP5 series because of the weld marks (Same with the G3 I guess). Along with the handguard I think it gives it a simple, no bullshit look. 

I like the XM8 because it looks like a fish, and it has a futuristic look that appeals to me.

Finally I like most 7.62 platform guns (FAL, G3, SCAR-H) because of the larger magazines. To me, it gives it a sturdy look. This one is harder for me to explain, but that's a good way to put it.

Those are my raisins.  




 Yeaaaahhhhh Dealiest Warrior is definitely sketchy.

 Eh I'm good.  
I'm not a fan of HK pistols, and I'd probably get a GG UMP if I got a UMP 




 Magic. I shoot with magic.  
And by speed up that travel, what gats do you have? 




 I could see maybe dolphin could pass, but I thought the general consensus was it's a boat 




 FN2000 is boat 




 I had a dream once that I was swimming in an ocean and XM8's were the fish 




 Man... It was that long ago?  
Heh. 




 Oh. Well the STG.58 sounds cool. 




 I heard that Madbull was working on one 




 You could find a KA L1A1 or the Ares L1A1 somewhere? 




 Sig 551-chan best raifu 




 Once I get another HK gat I'm gonna move to FN 




 I researched it a really long time ago lol
 




 Turns out the breed of fish (Oscar Cichlid) I bought grows really fast and it needs a ***fifty gallon*** tank to live comfortably. Also, I guess it will grow up to twelve inches long. 

HK-sama's gotta wait  :'^( 




 I'm already a major in Meme Science and a minor in Rare Pepes bby 




 \Not being able to use dank arrows  
\Not getting free college 




 You are average pleb.  
You have not yet accepted the grace of HK. 




 I have XM8 above. XM8 is best fish gun. 




 Alright, thanks. I'll just delete the post so people don't get too upset. 




 The bubbles just stayed from yesterday and haven't dissipated.  
I should have said I got the fish today, and the tank yesterday lol

I filled it yesterday and let it cycle and stuff all day yesterday, and added the water conditioner and stuff.  




 I got into it from watching the OP and figuring, "Huh sciency stuff, alright" 




 That's why the show gets a lot of hate, but I loved the slice of life beginning and the mind fuck ending. It's definitely my favorite anime. 




 Yeah I cycled the tank and did all of the stuff I did with my first tank. I planned on keeping this tank set up for another month and saving up for a larger tank. 

When I get a larger tank I was planning on getting a clown knife fish, which I originally wanted but figured an Oscar would be good for now. 




 Did I do something wrong..? 




 I will put cameras on them and mount gats 




 Also [the KGB never used it.] (http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/List_of_firearms_used_by_the_Armed_Forces_of_the_Russian_Federation) 




 [Bam.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0korpion_vz._61)  
"Czechoslovak submachine gun developed in 1959"  
"Adopted by the Czech army and security forces, and later exported to various countries."  
[Also in the list of people who use it, Russia isn't even there.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0korpion_vz._61#Users) 









 The Scorpion isn't Russian, but it's Czech so you could say East Bloc kit 




 East Bloc kit. That'd make sense if you said that. 




 Ayy 




 Great username by the way 




 [They did do a really good job on this show] (http://i.imgur.com/7o9weSX.gif)

 I have a webm of this saved. This is kind of what I imagine it'd be like if this happened to me, expect all I have is 300 GB of flashdrives in weab shit.  
It's nice to have a youtube link, thanks. 




 I've been listening to a lot of regular boss nova music after finding [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1puc4EMP9olist=PLJIhLbDdr8NNJTCNy2E3PXxySkz7TK0MWindex=2) in a /v4c/ thread and just found this playlist.  









 Ohhhh that's awesome.  




 Do you think he'd base it off the VFC or something similar, or the WE? 




 It's a metroid 




 ***DJ KHALEDDDD*** 




 GO BUY YO SELF A HOUSE 




 **GURL YOU SMAWHT** 




 Dolphinately 




 Mine is [space AUG] (http://i.imgur.com/IUYQUFy.jpg) now. 




 Yeah, after awhile I was like, "This gun is shit"  
Then I got a JG AUG 




 I started with a Crosman Gameface AK lol 




 [It's almost to regular sport-line AEG and then it falls short] (http://www.evike.com/products/48536/) 




 ^^^^^Yes. 




 **Yes.** 




 Oh I didn't see that hat part and assumed you were talking about the gun since it's shiny, and hats aren't. 




 But it has the add to cart option for some reason lol 




 Should've saved up a little bit more to get the other sport-line G36 model that Umarex sells 




 It's because it's that cheap springer/lpeg combo G36 that Umarex sport-line makes 









 Fun 




 YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE~ 




 What really happens if you swallow magnets? I wanna know.  
One time I ate a triple A battery and it never came out.

 If you watch the full video with volume then the part with the gate makes more sense. I thought it was zombies, but the guy up against the fence is her father helping her escape from some sort of rebels or combatants.

 \tfw you aren't even living by yourself/you're a minor and still act like a robot 




 Other than work and airhard I pretty much stay home lol 




 Fun show all around only into episode 3.  
I also thought, "Man what if Tamako was at school or some shit, and the whole shopping district was carpet bombed while she was gone"

I need to go outside.  




 I've heard wonderful things about it. 




 srry bb 




 Ask /u/Catbrain then lol 




 Ha. Sorry.  
I'm guessing you're just a random dude who doesn't airsoft and gets a lot of annoying messages from people who think you're /u/Catbrain lol 




 Airsoft World is a popular UK retailer.  




 \Not torrenting everything 




 I watched the whole series subbed first, and then dubbed and it's still my favorite anime. 




 Ask /u/Catbrains then lol 




 I've played for three years and now my walls are covered in guns lol 




 Asides from the corrupt government and the forgotten species of time? 




 Yeah it's the official.  
I agree that they didn't get the same level of emotion, but I think it's one of the best dubs I've seen. Also, I thought the voice was very suiting.

 Only difference is the bucking, and motor. Echo 1 SOF 2 comes with an Echo 1 motor. 




 Isn't this only the K since it has the skeleton foldy stock, and not the full foldy stock?

 Stupid SD card port won't work.

 Lemme grab le camera 




 I love everything HK and I like Bundeswehr gear, but I'd never think  of doing a complete loadout. I have a set of Tropentan BDU's but that's probably as far as I'd go lol.

Also are you sure it's the G36E or the standard G36? I thought my G36 was a G36E, but the bayonet lug is the one on the standard G36. 




 Oh the WE Open Bolt GBBR G36's have stickers of those trades there.  
Nice to see another airsofter delving into the beautiful world of HK.  




 What's the gun..?  
The sticker makes me think WE, but it also looks exactly like my G36 by JG so I'm confuse.  




 Ha. Cool.  
I met a kid and asked if he airsofted and he showed me one of those Cybergun FAMAS's, and he said what guns do I have. He about shit his pants when I turned my laptop and showed him my gun walls.  




 Meh
