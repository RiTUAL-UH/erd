No me pregunten por qu pero la noche anterior, cuando nos estbamos acostando, le dije que no vaya a donde tena que ir. Simplemente tenia un mal presentimiento. Nos despertamos 6:30 am y se lo volv a decir, quera que se quede en casa conmigo, y bueno, lo hizo.       

Nos despertamos 9 y pico con el mismo escenario, 25 mil llamadas perdidas cada uno, y empezar a tratar de entender qu estaba pasando. Fue horrible para nosotros que estbamos en casa, no me quiero ni imaginar para el resto de la gente que lo vivi de mucho ms cerca.          

Fue algo fortsimo, al da de hoy sigo pasando por el mural de Once, y s que si me detengo a verlo, me angustio instantneamente.

 You're very welcome! It's crazy indeed. Even more crazy was that in that time of war, our newspapers and TV news channels said *we were winning the war*, when that was absolutely incorrect. Bare in mind, lots of TV shows made 24hs transmissions with entertainment content to gather food and clothes for the soldiers, all of which ended up in the hands of the generals and commandants, and none of the soldiers... 

It's a very interesting subject, what happened in Argentina (well, latinamerica to be more precise) around the late 70s and early 80s. Google it and you'll be amazed with the numbers. For example, close to 30.000 people were abducted, tortured, killed and disappeared by the military forces that were in power then, only in Arg. The huge majority of their bodies are still missing, with little to no data about what happened to them.

It's a part of our story that is very present to this very day, because a lot of the babies that were stolen by the same forces then are now adults who rediscover their identities with DNA tests and come foward as "hijos/nietos de desaparecidos" (sons/grandsons of disappeared people). Lots of us (me including) have family members or family friends who've been abducted and tortured. It was a dark time, and a scar that isn't quite cured yet. 




 I think you should go and see a doctor, you may be experiencing a stroke 




 I'll try to be brief, it's a very long subject, but basically... British people have populated the Falkland Islands for a long time, and they've claimed it as their own. In 1976-1983 there was a military dictatorship goverment in Argentina, and between all the shitty and genocidial decisions they took, they decided to "recover" the Islands. They sent 18 year old boys with faulty old weapons, very few clothes and very few food to battle agains a very, VERY superior british army.

Of course our country lost that war, leaving 600+ dead argentinian boys and a huge scar in the history of our country. The Falklands remain british territory, and some people here say that we should reclaim them again, that they are ours, not theirs.

If you ask me, the majority of people of my age (I'm 23 years old) doesn't really care about them. I say leave them the Islands, we can't get our country to run properly, why add more territory that we can't handle? It was pretty good trade point but we don't use that kind of export zone anymore, so we don't really have a use for them. 

Also, in my age group, there's very little to no hate towards british people or their culture. It's a thing that older people have mostly, and generaly they're also big retards in other aspects of life or political understanding. That war was just an excuse to mantain the dictatorship longer in power. The militar that was president then and that commanded the war (General Leopoldo Galtieri) was a dude that LITERALLY went to public speeches totally DRUNK, and sometimes with a glass of whisky in his hands. So, as you can see, this war was pretty pointless to begin with.

Since then (1983) a lot of the argentinian culture was based on that british hate. For example, that soccer game where Armando Maradona passed alone like 4 or 5 rivals and scored a goal is mostly remembered here not only because it was a great play, but also because it was against Britain in the World Cup. 

I for one can't hate someone just because they were born here or there, it just seems stupid to me. I know that the majority of british youth doesn't even care about that war and/or us, so... It's all good.

 /r/cringe 




 I agree with you, but I wanted to say something about this bit

 Unless they come up with some novel way of procedural generation of areas to make it feasible but I doubt this will be a surefire fix to this problem.

Bare in mind that Diablo 3 (and I'm sure other games do this as well) already has something similar; in the infinite dungeons you get random generated dungeons (that could be caves or spaces in TES) that never end until you either die or choose to get out. I see this could be applying in TES with a few tweaks in the future to make it more RPG-alike and less ARPG, like Diablo 3.
 




 I think what he meant is that in a future we could mod SkyWind and SkyBlivion into Skyrim, to make it all a single game.

Now that I think about it, could this be actually done? I haven't played other TES other than Skyrim, but I'm guessing they occur in different times and the stories could get crossed. 




 There's just so much of it 




 Spanish! Sorry I took so long answering this, I didn't see your comment haha

 De la Ra declar Estado de Sitio con toque de queda y murieron manifestantes bajo su poder a mano de fuerzas armadas que estaban reprimiendo, y defendiendo esa animalada. Tambin fue el presidente responsable cuando se tom la medida del "corralito". Son datos fcticos y con sangre, algo MUY distinto a las *acusaciones* por enriquecimiento ilcito. Ests comparando cualquier cosa, me parece errneo decir "por mucho menos". De la ra tenia un pas entero en su contra y decidi tomar una medida an peor. 




 The sad part for me is that this isn't even the first time I've got rickrolled this year. 









 I work at a pharmacy and I was restocking the aspirine section, when I dropped 2 boxes to the floor and accidentaly tripped with them.

15:17: tripped.     
15:17: im on the comedown now.      
15:17: I think I really hit bottom, no more drug dropping for me.     




 After two weeks of being dankrupt, I learned that my dealer got busted, and it appears that he's going away for a long time. This is super bad news to me as I don't know any other good dealers, and in my country is hard to get good weed.

Maybe I'll start growing my own, but its going to take time and practice. Sigh, it's a sad day for me, ents. I'm forseeing months without any, but well, I guess it was about time to start growing my own.

Uptoke for me tonight, friEnts. I love you all. 




 *I included a TL;DR at the end.*

So, last night I was wondering if I could consume Salvia in an edible way, to get a longer and more controlable/less chaotic trip, but the problem was I had only an extract (40x) and not the leaves.

After reading a bit, I decided that the best way of getting there with the tools I had was smoking slowly and in slow quantities. Around 00:30 my parents went to sleep, so I locked the door, made sure there wasn't anything breakable in my surroundings, got the water pipe out, the torch lighter, and the extract. This was my first time solo, and I wanted to go slowly and with care. I had 2 pretty strong experiences and 1 total breakthrough with Salvia, but always with friends, music, and lights on.

So, I smoked a bit and felt a little bit weird at about 3 minutes. This was still with the lights on. I still knew who and where I was, and that I was feeling like that because of the drug. I take another hit and now things begin to vibrate. I'm starting to loose the grip of my selfness and begin to see my vision sense as something more abstract, more "decontextualizable". I begin to see my perception of my life itself as something material, more simplified and understandable. I believe at that point that I'm going too fast, so I wait a bit, and when the high goes a bit down at 10 minutes, I pack another small bowl and hit it, but now I'm with the lights off and near to my bed.

When I did this, I lay down in the bed and put on an eye mask (those things they give you in airplanes so you can't see), and now I begin to see myself, my conciousness, as I start to "fall" from reality. After a couple of minutes of mild visuals and "seeing" myself, I decide to take another hit, a bigger one, and when I do, I lay down again, put on the mask, and exhale. When I did, I began to see my perception and my mind itself, my "way of thinking, of perceiving, of existing in this body" in a very material way. I mean that I materialised my very existance and understood in that moment that I am not only a human being, this is one my forms and therefore one of my many, many realities. I saw myself as an infinite being, which has no notion of past and future, only present, and that this, my human form of thinking, of existing, and of perceiving, is only one way of an arranged and organised way of existance. 

I saw the very fabrics of my reality, I now understand that what I perceive is a frame in a multiple quantity of frames, each one different from the other. I am currently in this one, but with Salvia I fell from it and watched it from far away, with perspective. 

Now, this is important. I began to panic because I couldn't think and perceive the existance as I used to, and I was afraid to be this way for ever, because I had understood reality itself and now there was no turning back. But, when this happened, I remembered that someone here said to "let go". Just let go your way of thinking, stop trying to control everything that happens on your trip, and surrender yourself to randomness. I did, I gave up every control I was trying (unsuccessfully) to have and it was very liberating. I fell in the flow of my trip and all traces of fear were gone. 

And then, I peaked. I saw ripples of different realities being generated with each motion of myself and with each thought, and in an infinite loop saw how these very realities formed a much giant larger one, like a field of reality made of little tiny other ones, and this giant larger one reapeated itself infinitely to form another giant reality, and so and so on, for eternity. I remember trying to stand up (in these other realities, I was really in bed and not trying to stand up for real), and when I did, I remembered that I've been always standing up for eternity and saw myself doing it for ever. I was wordless, I was witnessing the fabrics of existance and I won't ever forget that. It was one of the most gorgeous things I've ever seen.

This went on for 2 hours **(!)** and it had ups and downs. As I began to enter reality again, I saw it as more complex and more "in focus" than when I was watching it from far away, and I saw myself, surrounded with my notion of the universe, as super super tiny. When I was coming back, I began to see the back of my head and the universe complete, in very similar sizes. But, as I was stepping into this reality again, my head and the notion of myself began to grew smaller, and the universe larger, until it took the form and size that has now. When I watched my clock, it said 2:30am, and I couldn't believe it. It was like 5 minutes for me.

This is by far one of the most beautiful experiences I've ever had. I hope to never forget the amazing places I saw and how I surrender myself to the trip, the first time of my life I gave up control entirely and met the Salvia experience entirely. I felt the plant itself, a gigantic powerful being, carrying me to show the other realities behind this one and making me understand that yes, this is one of many, many ways of perceiving and that I am much more than only one of them. It's like seeing yourself, but not you in your human form, not you in your name and in your country, in your world and in your galaxy. You, as an existing being, and nothing more. Undefinable by our common standars, by our very existance. You just are, and now you are in this frame, in this reality, but just for the moment. It's amazing.

I believe this is the right way **(FOR ME)** of doing Salvia, in the dark, alone, and without anyone watching you. Please, note that this experience was made at my own risk, and I do not reccomend anyone to try this for their first time of doing Salvia. Read and research A LOT before smoking Salvia, and if it is your first time, always do it with someone else; a sober sitter. I, in particulary, feel that being watched by my friends launching questions to me every 20 seconds and with music makes me paranoid and kind of having bad trips. I enjoyed this experience way much than my previous ones (which I also enjoyed in perspective).

**TL;DR:** Smoked Salvia 40x extract very slowly, alone, and in complete darkness. Tripped a lot, surrendered myself to the plant, and saw my very self as a part of much other existance forms. Total ego loss and understood my existance as an morphless being. Chose to come back after 2 hours and did, and now I see reality as only 1 option of perception.

Thanks for reading! If you have any questions or if you want to share some experiences, I'll try to make sure to comment on them all. Sorry if this is poorly worded; English isn't my first language. If something is sketchy please tell me and I'll try to rephrase it. 




 I want to go for the larger and less chaotic trip that smoking provides. I know that some people chew the fresh leaves and that this provides a longest and nicest trip, more controlable and enjoyable, but I don't have any.

Is there a way of cooking it or making a tea with the extract? Thanks! 




 Last week I tried it for the first time, and I loved it. It was a gram of 20X extract, and I smoked around 0.2g, with a water bong and a torch lighter. I loved the experience, it was pretty harsh coming back, but looking back at it, it was amazing. So amazing that I smoked again that same night, a few hours later, and loved it again.

Now I have 1 gram of 40x extract, and I'm probably going to smoke some today with my SO. The thing is, tomorrow I'm going to my friend's house, the one who has the 20x extract, and we're probably going to smoke as well that day. He sure is, I will see how I feel in the moment.

But, if I decide to, is there any risk for my health? I know there's no OD with this plant, but being the psychedelics effects so strong, can it damage me in any way?

Thanks!


EDIT: Hey guys! Many many thanks for all the responses. I didn't smoke today though, but tomorrow I will. I will keep track of how I'm feeling when I repeat the experience, sadly there's little to no information about this plant but everything seems to point that no risk is involved. I'm going to explore it with care and measure anyways, and I'll keep you guys informed if anything off happens.

Again, thanks a lot for the comments! They were of real help.
 









 Instagram clearly refuses to add another format than 1:1, but now Facebook (again, because they did this in the past but then removed it) is forcing people to crop 1:1 their new profile photos. It just sucks.

I just don't understand why is this. Can someone tell my why social networks are choosing to force people to 1:1, and if some other sites are using it as well? Of course you can add edges to your pic, but that decreases the size and therefore the quality of the picture when zoomed.

Thanks in advance.

no BULLSHIT, JUST [10] AMA 














 Well, this is my first post in /r/nosleep. I hope I'll be able to express myself well, since English isn't my first language.         

I was thinking, almost meditating, about distances between us people, and how the technology now easily available in every home allows us to connect us and debate instantly about ideas and conceptions. That's admirable, and it's something to remember and charish. Let's not take it for granted.          

But also, on the other hand, at the same time a lot of people can not access to this technologies and therefore is marginated from that community, geting behind in human evolution pace. And, a lot of them can not tell us their realities such as we can, and must be in dark places and needing our help, but without getting it. And it made me sad, to think of all those people, departed from their beloveds, kidnapped girls, war prisoners, war victims in the middle east, everyone and everything that you love, gone.                

And that made me wonder about my beloved ones, my house, my things. My life. What if, say 2 to 3 years from now, some political debate gets into a discussion, and then into an issue, and then, into a international complaint, and then, into a war. And its a war with your country, and another very threatening one. And this is ALL from a trouble that to this day, did not exist. Maybe it'll originate tomorrow, but, there's a chance that in 3 years, you will be in that situation.                                            

With your beloved ones gone. Imagine your neighrhood, destroyed, your family killed brutally by bombs and bullets of high .cal, your sons and brothers, and fathers, burned and mutilated. Imagine them, with their faces and their voices gone. You knowing that you wouldn't see them anymore, hear them anymore, hug them anymore. Feel them anymore, not ever again. Your pets, all killed as well, you and a few people you know and members of your family survived, but the hunt isn't over yet and you may be the next victim. Or your left beloved ones.                

So, this is something that seems far from true, and we say ourselves that it doesn't actually seems like something that could happen, so, I'm tranquile and I sleep well that way, not thinking about it. But, it could, it HAS, it IS (in other country, to people like you and me), in it WILL BE in some point, another great war.                                

It may not be violent war, with bombs, nukes and airplanes, it could be a echonomical war, which then ends in you and your family in poverty, dying from hunger and great recesion, or a civic war, or I don't know. We, as humans, know that in time, shamefully it's going to happen.                

And now, us that can seen it before it happening, need to do something. But we can't. It's not up to us.                  
 

It's NOT up to us. It's up to THEM.               


And THEY will decide if its your country's turn, my country's turn, or someone else's country turn. We just have to wait and... see.            

*Keep a good ear for the bangs and booms.*       


EDIT: a word  




 Time when you don't smoke weed to avoid or dimish tolerance to THC 









 Ever since Season 1, when they're about to kill Eddard I was thinking "OK, he's going to get saved, obviously, any moment now... any moment... wait... what?", and so I learned that this show is not like any other show, or books for that matter.

What I mean is that I never expected to so much main characters to die, and this is something positive for me, because although I do not wish them to die, but to win and live happy forever (well, not quite, but you get my point), I enjoy the thrill of fights and challenges the characters face, because now I know that they CAN die. In any other shows, they won't die, they will only get CLOSE to dying and they'll be saved in the last second, and you get the thrill of suspense in fights and the not knowing, but you kinda expect that they will end up victoriously. But not here.

For example, when I watched last night's episode (S04E09), I was tense through the whole thing, and that's because Martin isn't afraid to kill a main character. I knew Jon could die any moment there, it was a real possibility, and that filled me with excitment. Again, I wanted him to "win" and that things ended well, and that's the same reason why I got so hyped up: because I knew the chance of that not happening was a real thing.

I like this feature a lot. It's like a double edged sword: on one hand, I get to see the characters for which I developed certain amount of affection get slaughtered, but on the other, I get the thrill and excitement of death and the "bad guys winning".

Sorry for bad english!

I think I would try that, just out of curiosity. 














 A friend of mine is starting to play LoL, so I created a new account to play along with him. We duoqueued (LVL 5 and 8 accounts), and we played like 10 or 12 games. This was just about now.


We lost most of these games, but not because of him being new, but because EVERYONE else was smurfing. And I mean, heavy smurfing. I was smurfing too of course, but I wasn't playing like full-hardcore-commando-faker. I'm very surprised of the quantity of people smurfing in low levels.

 I read once here on Reddit that diabetic people are told to inyect water on oranges so they can practice before inyecting themselves with insulin, and one time a doctor/nurse saw a person with this disease on the ER with ridiculous high sugar levels on their blood.        

They were inyecting the oranges with the insulin and then eating them.

 The state holds them (properties and money) until they're 18. 









 Yes. In my district, there is a "consejal" (I'm sorry, I wouldn't know how to name this position in english, it's a helper and a votant on the choices our mayor takes) that's currently 18, but has been since the age of 16.

It's nepotism (mayor's son) and utterly corruption, but almost nothing isn't it anymore around here. 




 I could own a house, and drive a car when I was 16 in Canada...
16 is when you get your G1... sure you need someone in the car with you but you can drive one.. and there is no legal age limit on how old someone has to be to own a house.. a 2 year old could own a house if their parents put it in their name.

None of those things are legal here (Argentina). 




 Voy a escribir en espaol ya que el ingls soy malo

 




 In my country, the legal voting age is 16, and you can vote even for presidential elections. I mean, you can't own a house, drive a car, or decide if you want to drink a beer, but you get to participate in the election of politicians. It's fucked up.

 I installed "DSLR Remote" (Android), it has multiple brands of cameras and a few cool functions. 




 I was trying to fix my IR remote for my Nikon D90, with no luck. I remembered I had some radios and a cable, which I used as a remote shooter in the past, but the cable was broken and I was beggining to feel defeated.    

Then I thought that maybe my S4 Mini had a IR transmitter, and searched for an app. Found one, installed it, and thought "this won't work, I'm sure". Great was my surprise when it actually worked PERFECTLY! I now have a remote IR shooter on my smartphone. I should've realised earlier, but well. Maybe my post helps someone in a similar situation, it's super useful and pretty cool as well.

 What an incredible, gorgeous movie. I'm so glad Nolan picked up so many things from it for Interstellar. In the slight chance that someone in this subreddit doesn't know where that quote is from, it's from Contact, a film from 1997. 




 I just wanted to chip in and say that after a very intense (and arguably irresponsible) salvia trip that led me to a very similar state like OP's, I did exactly this and got better in no time. Depression kicks A LOT stronger when you aren't completely sober. As this commenter says, stay it for a while. Keeping active, forcing yourself to go out and do activities helps a lot. It's hard at first but it does help.
   
I started meditating a few days ago and I'm really enjoying it, so I recommend you OP check it out too. I don't know if it's for everybody, but I did think it wasn't for me, and I'm glad I was wrong. Look it up, it's super simple, and it may help you calm down and stay more focused.

 Thanks so much! I'm definitely going to watch this video. 




 So, I've been having some issues lately that gave me some panic attacks and constant fear, and last night my fear "peaked" and I was very paranoid about very very stupid things.    

I've been thinking about meditating for some time now, and lurked this subreddit and read a bunch of the top posts to get good info on how to do it. I started today, feeling very down, seeing very desaturated colors, and with some fear still in my heart.   

I sat in a towel, with my legs crossed, and the tip of my thumbs touching (I did as described on the #1 top post here). I concentrated on my breathing after puting the alarm for 10 minutes, and started focusing. At first, lots of thoughts came by, that meditation wasn't for me, that it will accomplish nothing, etc etc, but as I read, I contemplated the thoughts and let them flow and pass by.       
          
Later, I began to relax, and to feel good. I could see my problems with a lot of perspective, and they started to feel very solvable. This brought a smile and a feeling of happiness. Over the course of those 10 minutes, I relaxed and reached a very clear mental status. I'm now totally and utterly astonished about my experience. It served me in a great deal, and although I know this is the first step of many, just doing it makes me feel great.

I look foward to do this again tomorrow, and the day after that. And the day after that as well. I have a trip in 2 weeks, in which I'm hoping to practice this as well.          

It was beautiful and very helpful, and I wished to share that with you. Of course any tips or advice are very well welcomed.  
   
Thanks for reading :)

 Friedick Nietzsche 




 I always thought about something in particular that I'd like to share. 

We are a very, VERY new species. We're on our very infancy; if we took all the time Earth has existed and compressed it in 24 hours, civilization exists about 4 miliseconds before midnight. Let alone speak about our time since the Universe itself exists. We, in the cosmic scale, exist for no more than a fraction of the blink of an eye.   

Yet, we have done so much things. We've traveled to our distant moon, and layed pieces of ourselves in other planets. We have already begin to explore our solar system, in so little time.  

What do all things alive want? What's the ultimate instinct of all species? To STAY alive. If you bear that in mind, and also that we have existed for so litte, you'll see that we have yet to evolve a awful lot. I think we'll get to a point in which we'll learn that the best way to survive, is to coopearte with each other. Now, I see that happening in a lot of time, maybe millions of years, but I definitely see that as a real possibility. I believe once we've achieved that point, in which we only wish to survive as a whole species, progress is going to be made a lot, lot faster. We're not as intelligent as we could be, and we know that. Killing ourselves is not the best way to coexist, and maybe one day we'll get pass that. 


Now, if you take into account all these things that I said, maybe we could exist for much much longer, and achieve an understanding of spacetime beyond our dimensions. Maybe we'll discover a form of fuel that lets us travel a lot faster and a lot cheaper. Maybe in a long time we'll be able to actually go to other galaxies, to bend and stretch the dimensions of spacetime to our likehood. It's a possibility that I like to imagine. 

This is why I think it is actually possible to know other civilizations, to enter other galaxies, to spread our species accross the universe. There's also the chance that before that, we annihilate ourselves in the next 500 years, but I like to believe otherwise. Maybe I'm just a fool, or naive, but maybe this isn't so crazy after all.

 An outside observer would never witness you cross the horizon, as you approached, you'd slow down and any light emitted would redshift to zero

How long would this take?
 




 We would never see something going into a black hole, right? It would take infinite time from our perspective to see say a planet or a star get sucked it, because of time dilation. So, how is it that we observe they grow?  




 What if we 'faked' gravity using centrifugal force?

Look, I just snapped this upvote with my 10mm lens inverted. It's really fun to make macros with this technique: http://i.imgur.com/46bocpu.jpg 




 Yes! 35mm is a great focal lenght for achieving this. Make sure you open the diaphragm a bit (not fully open). You can do this by sliding to the sides a little metal piece in the back of the lens, which controls the aperture. 




 This is a Nikon 50mm f/1.8 lens inverted on a Nikon D90. 

Inverting lenses that are in the range of normal-wide gives you an incredible amplification and you can get really good macros with it. The 18-55mm and the 18-105mm that come as a kit in basic reflex are great for doing this, at 18mm you get CRAZY magnification.  




 Haha, indeed it does. Thanks! 




 The guy's just saying her that he wants more, because it hurts having her only as a bootycall (or sorts). That fucking bitch posts this man's pain on Facebook and laughs at it, what the fuck?

 I agree 100% with you on this one. I may get downvoted because of this comment (I'm stating no opinion or contributing discusable material on the subject) but I just sincerily felt my upvote wouldn't cut it, and felt the need to put it in words.  




 I drink beer often, and smoke weed even more regulary. I think it's most because spilling weed feels worst than spilling beer, because of what "it represents" (in terms that weed is more expensive and more difficult to get because of its legal status than beer).

Also, and I'm not saying you're stating this (other comments above are), I don't see why saying you do drugs is a synonim of looking for attention. They're forbidden, yes, but at what point? Beer and marijuana are among the easiest accesible drugs for everyone. The social judgement of them has changed so much that doing them isn't seen as rebellion anymore (weed may be a little more arguable at this point though). I don't think stating that you smoke weed is looking for attention. Sure, lots of teenagers and stupid adults do, but I think they're a minority among drug users.  




 Wow, that's incredible. Totally going to try that at home! 
























 This may come off as pretty random but, as an argentinian, me da mucha vergenza los comentarios que algunos de mis compatriotas hacen frente a lo que pas, alegrndose del caos.

De todo corazn deseo que puedan recuperarse pronto y siento mucho las perdidas que han sufrido.

Edit: sorry, a bit of context. Some argentinians hate chileans and visceversa, which is of course a pretty idiotic thing to do, and they are glad each time something like this happens in Chile. I'm just saying to the guy that as an argentinian myself I hope he doesn't think we are all like that and that I'm very sorry about what happened and hoping that they recover from their losses soon. Sorry to hijack the comment thread but I didn't come cross a chilean these days and seeing what my fellow countryman are saying, just wanted to put it out there.

 Have you ever heard about that theory that says in the future a super intelligent AI will take control of the planet and it's robot minions will torture you basically for eternity unless you've contributed to their creation? And also they have a method in which they can tell exactly how many times you thought about this without doing anything, and each time only makes it worse and they torture you even harder for it? 

I read it on Reddit, of course. It's like The Game but super hardcore mode.

 That's a great saying. This is actually a known process, which of course I can't recall the name now (maybe someone else does) in which the person uses every bit of information, even the ones that contradict them, to build their belief stronger. For example, a pseudoscience study comes along saying that vaccinations and autism are severely related = this must be true, their belief grows stronger. Then a scientific study properly made comes along and says vaccinations and autism aren't related = this must be false, their belief grows stronger. It's very irritating.

 Dawkings talks abouts theories that are backed up with science, and doesn't say (nor denies) that atoms are sentient, because he (scientifical community as a whole actually) doesn't have the slightlest evidence that would point towards that. Chopra could be right, but he's talking out of his ass, he has absolutely NO evidence to support what he's saying, and he says it smiling and ridiculising science. It's very upseting.

 /r/atheism was a default? Lol, what the fuck? I'm an atheist myself but that entire place is a giant circlejerk of idiots who jack off at their own posts. And even if this wasn't the case, why make a religious based subreddit a default? Seems weird. 




 Hey, I know life can get pretty though sometimes. Hell, I've known lives that were though since they existed. But trust me when I say to you, it can get better. It's in the power of our inmense will and effort, but it sure can. I advice you seek professional help if you haven't yet, and in the meantime, check /r/suicidewatch and /r/depression.

 I like to sit, take 1 hour, put Netflix, and roll myself 8 or 10 joints. I first grind the bud, then carefully cut the filters and proceed with the rolling. I take my time so that every joint is perfect and nice in size and thick. I enjoy so much this process.  

Then, I save them in a metal Camel box I have that's only meant for saving joints.   

It's beautiful. It's good. It brings me joy. 

I haven't smoked in a couple of months. Now I've got my job back, money coming, and as I write this I'm waiting to go pick up the bud I love so much. Smiling is inevitable right now.

Just wanted to share it :)

 This made me cry. Thank you for such beautiful words. 




 Nos watch it again and say that one more time but backwards 




 So yes scooters? 




 Hm, yes, you are correct; I did misinterpret the vignette here. But, although the photographer (or editor) didn't use a vignette technique, I stand saying there's an over saturation of the colors and lighting of the face in comparison to the rest of the picture. That, and the natural framing of the background (that tends to darken to the edges) produce a very much vignette alike effect on the eye.  

So, while technically the use of vignette isn't here (we can notice that if we look at the evenly lightened grass), the effect achieved is the same, by other techniques. For my taste, the lion's face "stands out too much", as in an excess for seeking attention to it.

Let us all please remember that photography is a form of art, and as in all forms of art you can bend and break rules (to a point I believe), and althought I wouldn't have processed this picture as it is because I dislike the end result, I believe it's what the photographer wanted and I respect that. Of course constructive criticism helps, and it should be fomented, not bashed in saying "redditors say it's over processed always".  




 Not in DSLRs. I also believe some C41s film rolls came with midstep  ASA/ISO, but I may be wrong there. 




 I too am a professional photographer, and what /u/drakeg4 is saying is essentially correct. Use of vigneting should be subtle in most cases (of course there are no unbreakable rules in these fields), and generally an excess of it produces a weird effect. It's mostly used to emulate natural frames and help the composition of the photo by drawing the eye to the desired point, but here I too believe it's overused.  

I also see an over saturation of the face colors in comparison with the rest of the photo. Again, to each it's own and I believe the photographer achieved what he wanted, that this is the final result he had in mind. But I also don't like it and I think the argument that the user you replied to have is far from invalid. 




 No, of course I didn- YEAH I DID SO WHAT

 Hi!

Well, I read here somewhere that tachyons aren't possible because they represent a violation in causality. So far so good. But, the explanation to why this happens doesn't quite get in my head. A redditor kindly wrote an example about two spaceships that are in a duel. The two of them travel away from each other at great velocity until they count 10 seconds, and then spaceship A fires their tachyon cannons to spaceship B. But, because of time dilation, 5 seconds have passed for spaceship B when they get hit, so they respond immediatly by firing, sending the blast before spaceship A fired the initial shot.

Now, I get why that violates causality (obviously), but the thing I don't get is; why does time dilation makes the time happen differently for both spaceships if they're traveling away from each other at the same speed? Wouldn't their 10 seconds be the same 10 seconds for both of them since they're at same speed?

 "This moment today, now, this that you are reading, will be a memory 50 years from now. It already is. You are already remembering this, and 50 years have passed. It's 2065 and this present once future will also become a past".

Isn't it perfect that it was voiced by Steven Ogg though? Like in, Steve-O?  









 You're right. Thanks for pointing that out. 




 I mean, OP's complaining about a Reddit fanatic that spends every minute of his day here and describes a pretty unique and identificable work situation with lots of details... on Reddit. Yeah, I'm going on a limb and say this is a very fake TIFU. It's obvious that OP knows the *worst* thing he can do (unless he blatantly wants his coworker to find out that he's annoying him) is post it here, doesn't make much sense. 




 I understood it, and explained it earlier in a lower post. 




 Then come over to /r/thatHappened, we've even got $200% and $420% real legit stories! 




 Those two were rethorical questions. 




 This is why we have /r/thatHappened, to post ONLY legit $100% stories! 




 The fact that you can't properly contextualise analogies and believe that I'm saying Valve = a SO/person in absolutely every aspect just because I compared exageratedly to prove a point how bashing something you may like again in the future may not be the best choice and interpreted that as me being a fanboy shows me how delusional you are.

I believe that needed more commas, but well. Put a hip hop beat on the background and it'll read better. 




 Of course it is, that's why I also disagree with the "let's all hail the allmighty Valve". That's exactly why people went to the other extreme all of the sudden, because they were on one extreme to begin with.

If you love anything as obsessively as PCMR did with Valve and NEVER criticise any aspect or bad decision, of course it's going to blow up as soon as they make the first very bad move.

This is why this subreddit has NOT to go back again to love Valve as they were the cure for all known diseases. As you say, it's just a company. I still believe a great one, but a company nonetheless. 




 Very interesting read! Thanks for the link. 




 Can't we just point a super high concentrated laser beam (something like 50kw) so we can see with the naked eye the light that bounces back? 




 The only thing I disagree with was the bashing with "What has Valve done in the few years for us?" and mega-lists of "look at the reasons for how Valve has sucked in the last decade". Those are words you can't take back.  

I always felt that they were going to back out from this decision in the first week or two, that's why I didn't engage in bashing the company's name. It's like having a fight with your SO and start spreading that she/him is a shitty partner, that she's a liar, etc, to all of your friends, and then coming back with her after fixing things. The people who you complained to don't forget the things you've said.  

Now, they may be true but there was no need in pointing out lists of only bad choices Valve has done and upvoting them to heavens with x5 golds. My reaction was "where was all hatred this last week?", and now "where is all this hatred now?" It's what's wrong with going from loving something, hating it, and then loving it again.

EDIT: TIL: don't use overly exagerated analogies, Reddit likes to interpret things very literally and believes I see a game company as my soulmate.

 For starters, I think Stiller did an excellent job and that he is an amazing actor. I just think maybe the movie would be (in my opinion and to my taste, that is) a little better if it would've been made in a more serious tone, with different casting.

For example, the role Seann Penn plays and how its portraited feels to me spot-on. I think he's a very serious, dark, and interesting character in a movie that has *some* silly-comedy bits, and would be better accompanied by a movie that goes along with that theme.  

All of that aside, I think it's an excellent movie. It made me cry, laugh, and it has that "Into the Wild" thing where you finish watching it and want to just go and ride a bike through the world. 




 I believe that kid is photoshopped there, although its a pretty weird picture even without the boy.

 I watched it really high the first time, and couldn't believe what I was watching. The music and the photography are incredible. I cried in the part that plays that Bowie's song, in the bar, where he has to decide whether he goes to the chopper or not.  

Upon watching it a few more times I believe it's an amazing film but could've been better with better less comedy-like casting. I don't think Ben Stiller was the best choice for that part. 




 She very clearly told him at the beginning she wasn't interested in anything serious.   



500 days of summer helped me a lot to "forgive" my ex for dumping me. I was in a lot of anger towards her, she didn't cheat on me or anything like that as far as I know, but I was very angry still. After the day we broke up I didn't talk to her and I distanced myself completely as I knew it was for the best, but I was still very hurt.  


That film made me realize she hadn't done anything wrong. The relationship wasn't the same in a long time and she acted in behalf of her own well being and made the decision she thought was best at the moment, how can I blame her for that? Why should I blame a person for taking a decision that they thought makes them happier? If I think I own that right upon someone, the selfish one is me, not them.

 I agree with you 100%, but it's true that in the other hand this subreddit has been making fun of people's deaths and weird diseases for a long, long time. Of course that doesn't make it right, it's wrong and we shouldn't take pics of these things, but this is the basis for this sub from like ever and it just seems off to me that suddenly everyone is offended by it. 




 This sounds like a horrible condition, and from what I read here it truly can happen to anyone. Are there some measures to prevent this from happening? Any activities (such as smoking, just for example) that can cause higher chances of developing it?

 No, "m" with that accent means something close to "myself" (as in "he called me" = "me llam a m"). The translation to "my" (of poseession, like "my car") is "mi", without the accent on the i. Trust me, it's my native language.

 Yeah, you're right for the most part, except for the meaning. Yoyo would be I-I, that's correct, but me means "m" (pronounced "mee"), not "me". For example "it happened to me" translates to "me pas a m".

 We're all on the same boat. The safe option is to install a pirated copy of GTA V on another folder or hard drive, but spending 65GB more only for modding doesn't seem much of a solution. 




 The second line makes sense. He states first that x equals y. He then says that x times x equals x times y, which is correct given the first statement.  

Let's assume x = 5. If x = y, and x = 5, then y = 5, so 5^2 equals 55, which is x^2 =xy 




 Think of the people that have Google fiber, 1gbps. That's insane, I has dial up 9kbps when I was a kid, I don't know how many times less that is (I'm almost asleep, is that nearly 3 million times faster?). Technology evolves at an amazingly fast rate.

 Phew, dodged that bullet, we almost got civilized there for a second 




 Quick story.  

In 2012 new years eve a couple of friends, my gf and myself were walking home after a night out, at maybe 5-6am. They were like 15 or 20 of us. Out of the blue a car comes at 60ish MPH towards us, breaks and turns over repeatedly, hitting just with the tail one of my friends. Luckily it wasn't a serious injury (the car barely touched her) but it looked like it at the moment with all the commotion. We head towards the crashed car and got out the driver, who was a very drunk teenager. We called the cops and after they showed and took him, we got home. It was a very scary situation, we almost got killed and we returned as if nothing happened. 

But I remembered hearing the name of that teen when police asked it to him. So I searched him in Facebook, in Twitter, anywhere I could find him, with no luck at all. 

A few years later a friend and I were hanging in a bar near my home. Having a great night with some girls we met there, and one introduces us a group of friends of her. In that group was this guy. I remembered him very clearly, and when he said his name I said that yeah, I knew him, "you almost killed my friends me and my gf in new years eve". Man that was awkward, I don't know why I said it, it just came off me like that. He got very angry at first and after a lot of tension and discussion (he wanted to fight me, wtf) I told him we should drink a beer and talk privately. We did, and I said I didn't want to fight him, I just wanted to know if he was conscious about what he did that night, that he wasn't a murderer by the luck of a few inches.  

He cried and told me he hasn't been able to drive a car since, that he remembers what happened that day everyday, and that he was very sorry for what happened. I just felt that he was being sincere, so after a while I told him that at least me forgave him, that it was all cool. It was a powerful moment, I felt so much anger when I looked at him at first, but then we talked and I don't know, it felt great to hear him say that and it helped me a lot to forgive him as well. I haven't heard from him since, but I hope he stays well and that he never drinks and drives again.

OK, not so much for a quick story haha so, tldr: guy almost kills me, friends and gf in a DUI car crash, casually met him years later, tells me how hard that experience hit him and how he hasn't been able to drive again (morally of course, laws in my country sucks, as my English so sorry for that). 




 I don't care what kind of moral crusade you're on, or how justified it is, it's just weird to talk like this to someone.

Moral crusade? Not at all. Maybe it'd be a moral crusade and a bit weird if someone called them out for no good reason out of the blue, but this person is talking about becoming an Uber driver... People should know that their driver killed (not injured, *killed*) another person while driving drunk.

 Kryptonian, male. Also an adopted orphan. Please, insult me. 




 I don't know if I would call him a fucking scumbag, he regularly played with his viewers when he was on LoL and gave them a few tips. He wasn't great but he wasn't bad either, and never played too seriously, that doesn't make him a bad person, just someone who saw the opportunity at that audience and took it. It isn't always about super tryharding games and learning when watching, there are also a bunch of streams out there that like PL's have more of a comic tone and that's also alright. If people didn't like him they should've closed the stream, not sending the fucking SWAT team to his house.

 Exactamente. 




 Es muy posible. No s si harn autopsia (calculo que s), ah seguramente saldr bien qu fue. Ten en cuenta que la causa de muerte puede haber sido originada en cualquier lado, no exclusivamente en el corazn. Por ejemplo, puede haber sido un ACV, un tromboembolismo pulmonar, un cogulo arrojado por un tumor en cualquier rgano, una falla cardaca, etc etc, la lista es largusima. Para detectar cualquiera de estas cosas se necesitaran exmenes bastante especficos, lo ms leve siendo el ejemplo de un tumor que puse que en cualquier TC salen las masas, pero dudo que les hagan tomografas a todos los jugadores como parte de un examen fsico rutinal. 

Lo que s no existe es la "muerte sbita" en el sentido que est todo ok con tu cuerpo y de repente sin motivo te mors. Cuando se habla de muerte sbita se refiere a que sin razn aparente la persona fallece, pero el motivo siempre existe, el tema es encontrarlo. A veces se puede, otras veces no. Las enfermedades que comparten esta caracterstica de origen desconocido se denominan "idiopticas", la muerte sbita se podra bien llamar "muerte idioptica". En una autopsia es mucho ms fcil encontrar la causa porque no tens la limitacin de mantener a la persona viva o saludable, pods tocar lo que quieras sin preocuparte mucho y encontrs bien todo. Esperemos que lo hagan. 




 Me cans de aclarar esto ya. TODAS las ambulancias tienen desfibrilador, no lo utilizaron porque al desfibrilador no sirve para reanimar corazones detenidos como muestran en las pelculas, sirve para volver el corazn a ritmo en una fibrilacin ventricular, cosa que el pibes no tuvo.

Y aunque haya tenido vfib, te mata en segundos, la nica chance de usar un desfibrilador es tenerlo muy a mano y con un diagnstico seguro de que el sntoma es fibrilacin ventricular (no auricular). Desfibrilar a alguien con un paro cardiaco tiene el mismo efecto que meterle el dedo meique en la oreja.

 /u/ibleeedorange, I *think* he stopped with the massive posts but he was kind of big too 




 That's literally what he said... 




 Yeah, I'm officially done replying to you. I hope you find a way to talk less arrogantly about your opinions and open your mind to advice a little bit, it's so pointless to talk this way that I'm done wasting my time.

Adis! 




 I just saw this, thanks so much for sharing it here! 




 I wasn't trying to lecture you, Jeez... I just disagreed with how you felt that your struggles were more complainable and your ex-BF didn't have the right to complain about what happened to him. 

EDIT: To expand a bit, you said "I have a hard time relating to people who had it easy. And I hate to say it, but I often find it hard to have sympathy for them when they tell me about their struggles". This is wrong, because to other people YOU are complaining about non important things (think of the example of the kid who couldn't go to school, and you're complaining about going to twelve of them). So, in a way, you also had it "easy". I'm not saying your struggles aren't worth of complain, quite the contrary, I'm saying everyone's elses also are. 




 I seems that I've offended you. I'm sorry, that wasn't my intention at all, I believe you've misinterpreted my post. It wasn't either an agression, nor a comment about your lack of empathy (which I never said was the case). 

Please try to give it another read. 




 I'm sure am :) With the power of therapy and a lot of help and love from my close family, I like to think I managed to transform the whole shit package to something nicer. It's cool to get good things about bad situations. It's hard as fuck, I won't lie to you on that one, but it's good.  

I also believe this will be a edging (is that the word I'm looking for) matter on my life for a long time, maybe for ever. I will continue to try getting good things out of it, and remember the bad memories as something far away from my current reality.  

Thanks for your kind wishes. 




 Well, I get your point, but as I somewhat stated above, I think it's all about personal experiences and points of view. I'm sure to your ex-BF changing to 3 schools was really hard, because in his personal experience that was (maybe) one of the worst things or the hardest things he has lived. For you and me, that's not as hard, because we changed schools a lot more, and we view that as "a piece of cake". For us changing 12 schools (I'm on 9 here) was a lot of struggle, but if a uneducated child from a poorer situation hears us, he says "well, what are you complaining about? at least you got to go to school".   

Everyone experiences only one life, one point of view, and their standars for best and worst are as valid as yours or mine. At the same time, a lot of people hears my story or others here and goes "wow, that's super awful", which it is, but honestly it sounds worse if you compare it to their situation, to me it was horrible, but it also felt like what "normal" was. Later on on life I found out that this wasn't the regular thing, let alone the acceptable thing to happen to a kid.  

What I'm trying to say is that empathy is a powerful feeling. Maybe on of the most. There is always going to be someone who has it worse, and someone who has it best. Another quick example before I bore you with all this; you know when you see someone with lots of money and say "wow, if only I can have that... I could be so much happier!". Well, rest assured that someone else has thought the same thing about your situation sometime. Maybe a homeless guy, maybe someone who wishes has your looks, maybe someone who wishes education, I don't know. I believe that gives me some perspective about thinking in other people's shoes. 




 No problem, I did on another comment though so I'll paste it here.

I had lot of trouble eating because he was yelling drunk all the time and hitting things, so sometimes (most of the times actually) I didn't eat much, he would force me to, I would puke because, you know, I was a fucking kid, and he would made me eat that too. 




 Argentina. Incredible shitty laws and justice system in general. You won't believe what people can do unpunished here. 




 Of course, I'm from Argentina. 




 Ha, thanks a lot! I wrote wrong a few words but I'm glad I could get the general message across. 




 Probably. I honestly don't care, his personality doesn't affect me any longer. I just see him a couple of hours once every other month. 




 Argentina! 




 The law enforcement here is a mafia, I'll give you that, but there's 0 protection towards citizens. We all feel uncomfortable when we have cops around, they all treat us like shit and are corrupt as hell. 




 Thanks, it sure sucked, but then my mother grew strength from what seemed thin air and kicked him out when I was 9. He was a religious fanatic, and he prohibited my mom to work because he said psychologists practice arts from the devil, and that she was possessed by demons. That led to my mom and I having no money when he left (and of course I didn't hear from him for 4 years) buy we were happier than ever.  

My mom then met this amazing guy who she's married to now, and he has been my father in a lot more aspects than the biologic one, so I appreciate that a lot as well and I'm grateful for it :) 




 I had lot of trouble eating because he was yelling drunk all the time and hitting things, so sometimes (most of the times actually) I didn't eat much, he would force me to, I would puke because, you know, I was a fucking kid, and he would made me eat that too. 




 The law force in my country is absolutely non existent, as the justice system. For example, just yesterday a judge lightened the sentence of a rapist who had abused a 6 year old kid saying that "the kid is gay so there isn't much damage to be done". Seriously. You can look it up, happened yesterday in Argentina.    

Besides, my mother feared the shit out of my father. 




 Yes, I totally worded that wrong, haha, sorry. 




 It's rough, and it sucks, but being in a similar position I can tell you that most of us who get shitty parents find a way to grow stronger and develop more resilience with it. Of course this isn't all cases, sadly. It sounds super harsh and rough because you are seeing it from a perspective of a more happier family, but at least in my case it helped to build a stronger self and more generally responsible of my life. It's amazing the things we can endure when we have to.  




 My dad put a loaded gun on my mom's mouth and said to her that if she didn't get an abortion, he would kill her. That was before I was born (I'm 23 now), and that's on top of years of hiting both of us, making me eat puke, fucking my aunt, and tons of other monstruous things. Luckily they divorced when I was 10 or so, and I got an amazing step father not so much later on.  

I didn't see it happen, but I know it did because he admitted to it after I confronted him with the truth. He's much different now, and I *kind of* get along, but I will never forgive what he did to my mother on that ocasion.  

Sorry if I have bad grammar, English isn't my first language.  

Edit: for those of you saying she should've reported him to the police, I don't live in a very much civilized country. The law system and enforcement here absolutely sucks. The only thing that happens when a woman reports her husband here is that then police show up if you're lucky, takes a few notes and then leaves, and I'm not even exaggerating, it's how it works. She didn't do it because she feared getting murdered and I totally understand her for it. She was married to a very insane man in a very shitty country, she got lucky to even got a divorce and be alive.

 Probably knowing that it's final. That yeah, he will never actually taktake actions to emend his mistakes, that he will never demonstrate he's sorry, that now the story has ended with the same bitter taste it began with. You have that certainty now, every piece of hope, even as much microscopically small it was it's now completely gone, for ever. He was in no way your father other than biologically, but the story didn't finish yet. Now it is.  

That's what hurts. 




 How did he stick his head in the collider? Aren't they supposed to run in a vacuum? 




 well i'd imagine most hard drugs must have some kind of appeal if some people are willing to destroy themselves and everything they hold dear for one more hit.  

I had problems with addiction in my past.
 Generally at this point you descrine doing the drug of choices isn't fun anymore, you chase those first highs when you felt amazing and awesome, but it's never ever the same. You kind of get satisfied for a bit and then crave more, and more, until you have no drug left and then you feel like fucking shit. Then you go and buy more, and the cycle repeats.  

You can't stop doing the drug but not because it feels super awesome, but rather because not using feels like fucking hell to an addict. 

 









 Hahaha I don't normaly comment on how good a comment is, but this is the best whoosh GIF I've seen by far 




 Whoosh 




 I'm trying to think outside the box here, I know this question is probably really stupid, but how do we know is mass causing gravity instead of lack of "no-mass"? I mean, suppose that empty space pushes you evenly in every direction, so, you stay stationary. But put an object with mass close enough to you to interfere with that pushing force, and you start going towards that object, because now your receive the pushing force from one side more than other.  

Does that make any kind of sense?
 




 Well, towards the end of the 90s (1998) it was discovered that the expansion of the universe is (very contrary to the belief in that time) occurring at an accelerating rate. Before that it was thought that galaxies moved away from each other more slowly as time passed, but since 1998 we know it's not, they move away faster and faster, and will continue to do so. One of the most accepted theories to explain this weird effect from the universe is the Dark Energy Theory, but it's 1:15am here and I'm about to sleep, so I'll leave that to another redditor or go into it a bit more tomorrow. 




 These two, both from /r/AskReddit:

-[What is the scariest theory known to man?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/31nbca/whats_the_scariest_theory_known_to_man/)   

-[[Serious] [NSFW] Redditors who have been on the brink of death/legally dead, can you describe what it felt like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2qmt72/serious_nsfw_redditors_who_have_been_on_the_brink/) 

Both had very deep and mindblowing questions. I particularly like the one from the redditors who have died, because most of them talk about the acceptance of death in those final moments, and brings my mind at peace knowing that maybe in those few last instants, I'll be ok with what's happening.

 I bet it was caustic soda, here in Argentina something similar happened, a girl drank a cocktail that had some of caustic soda in it and burned the shit out of her, but luckily she instantly spitted it and survived IIRC. She was hospitalised a few weeks though, that shit burns like nothing. 




 That's exactly my point, it's real, way too real, and I like this drama but after a bit dose of it I need some stupidshit drama to cool down a little. I mean, OP fucking died 3 times, I need to read 2 people fighting about which way is the correct way to grill a cheese sandwich. 




 COLD AS MOTHERLAND 




 Chose the finale where Roman dies to avoid this 




 It's like we need some eyebleach drama, I need to read some kids fighting over their rights to call other people names based on their physical properties, darknet dramas are always about death and super illegal shit 




 Fucking karma hoards 




 Excellent response, thanks so much! 




 Yeah we're not going to laugh about people forcing a mentally disabled person to eat shit and maggots. 




 I'm sorry for the stupid question, I'm a bit out of the loop here, there are no more books written so far? Does this means I can now read book spoilers without being spoiled? 




 You sound like a wonderful group 




 Man, I'm all for the human approach, but when I read things like *"Matthew was in hysterics  traumatised. He hasnt cried since he was six but he was shaking and crying"* and the whole article that comes with that, I just want to boil these people in diahrrea. 




 Oh god, I remember this... I mean, seeing it on TV, I was poor as fuck, but still, the nostalgia is strong. 




 I have Senn HD202, and the first couple of times I wore them backwards, then realised and changed it, but from the design they have the first reaction seems to put them wrong. I also saw a lot of people who used mines wore them backwards at first. Weird.  




 *flexes* 




 If you ever had a threesome, in average you slept with more than 1 sexual partner in every sexual encounter that you had in your life.  

Averages are fun. 




 Go to the bathroom, empty your bladder and then drink lots of water. Your bladder will stay empty by the time you are asleep
 




 Start a martial art. It's never too late, and the learning curve is fairly fast at the very beginning. Think it about it this way, 4 months from now you are going to wish you started today, make it happen! 




 I saw this exact photo on facebook a few days ago and gave it a try yesterday, it was amazing!  




 Even the link has three **-_-** faces 




 It costs 200 dollars. Remember that it spawns on helipads and parking lots, usually not more than 1,3km away from your char. That's cool.  

Personally I'm now going for the new sports car (can't recall the name), I love how it looks and sounds. I already have a Kuruma, a Hydra, and had multiple cars in the middle that I bought and eventually sold. When I get it I don't know what I'm going to get. 




 If you are going to fuck my fridge you better click on that link bro 




 A 69 in ASCII-land. 




 That's super awesome. 




 I was born on the 30th of September, 1999, making me 15 years old at this moment. I was born in that decade.

You were born like 2 months before the 90s ended, and you have literally 0 memories from that decade. /r/lewronggeneration much?

 His intention was to blow the fence, not the car 




 The smart thing to do here is to get a really strong computer virus and have it ask for more RAM. 




 Isn't it Colombian, not Mexican? 




 Nah, kill the dog, let him reunite with his owner 




 What? What happens then? Don't leave us in suspense! 




 The only reason they aren't fat themselves is because of all the circlejerking and calories burning it comes with 




 That was sarcasm (just letting OP know in advance) 




 What if our universe was created in the last release of HL3? What if a bunch of universes are created when they release it in this one?  




 Clever 




 Are Nazi Nazis the ones that correct you about wrong Nazi facts? 




 The worst part for me is that FPH is crying over "censorship" and if you even said that a fat person was human, they'd ban you from the subreddit and downvote you to hell. 

"Go be fat somewhere else" they said. Well, go be haters somewhere else, fuckers.

 I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO FEEL 




 This. This right here has to be the name we choose for this event. Like the nude leaks was "the fappening", this shall be "The Reddit Wedding". Spread the word. 




 We even have a weapon rack in the heists room.  




 Does it drive better than the zentorno? I was always mad at r* for making the best race car in the game so ugly. 









 I would but my internet fucking sucks rotten dicks :( 




 Dear god, what's wrong with some people? I have a friend that went out with a dude once, the guy was 'fine', but as soon as the date was over he texts her "did you like me? you think I'm masculine?". WTF... What kind of question is that? 




 That'll be $3.99 




 First one is free. 




 Even Tyrion is good looking in the show, and he's described as a monster in the books 




 Oh, she won't be cockless much longer. 




 /r/idiotsfightingthings 




 We need that calligraphy novelty account here 




 Frankly when I'm stoned everything surprises and amazes me, woahdude doesn't even have to come up with great stuff to accomplish that but they do, I always leave that sub with my mind blown 




 If you want to, PM me 




 True50, the page, allows you to do that. It redirects one address to either one of two others. 









 As a photographer, I photoshop a lot also. I agree with your post 100%, but just for clarification, the two images OP posted aren't even the same photograph. You can tell by the positioning of the hand and the arm tattoo, they are shot from a little bit different angles.  




 I found it very funny, can I upload it to my Facebook? I'll link to yours with credit of course. 




 Needs more flexing 




 Tambin la venta de pelis y series truchas en la calle contribuyen, la gente que no tiene internet en vez de alquilar en un videoclub se compra los dvds en esos puestitos o en el transporte publico, le sale mas barato que alquilar y la compra 




 Jesus fucking christ... 




 What happened? 




 God damn man, at this point it will have to be epic level the second coming of Jesus to live up with the hype

 Aren't you the guy that writes awesome stuff? For real, I love your writting, man. 




 Aren't you that relaxed guy from Redd-? Wait, no, you're not. 




 [He's most likely a dude.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/zisq6/down_45_lbs_and_gained_a_smile/c651568?context=3) He (?) says totally out of verse and in reply to a comment "Actually, by 'this dude' - I meant me."

Damn, that took long to find. 




 *One million walkers!* 




 Hahaha I lost it at the arm falling on top of the crates 




 Are you Warlizard from the Warlizard Gaming Forums? 




 Seems like it isn't my best day commenting 




 You're saying that a teacher advicing students to study, because otherwise they won't meet the knowledge to approve the class is a threat. I believe you need to learn the concept of threat, because with that logic every advice in "don't do X because Y (bad thing) is going to happen to you" form is a threat to you.   
  
As other people said, if he's doing this out of pure justice seeking, he should also in all the other "sellers" that aren't registered as well. Besides, being in the legal right doesn't mean it isn't a dick move, OP may face jailtime because a very stupid thing.  




 I think you need to learn the meaning of the word "threat", man. 




 Thanks for the correction! I don't know why people are downvoting you, you were right, I meant peek, not peak. 




 Also depending on the direction in which you turned our it, you may have sent it backwards. Try remembering a few days back. 




 Click it... You know you want to... Just a quick ~~peak~~peek, no one will know, it'll be out secret... 




 So, according to that logic if a teacher tells her students "if you don't study you are going to fail the class", she's threatening them. Please, stop saying ridiculous things, I'm not treathing anyone. 




 Yeah I think I'm on the wrong internet again 




 I'm not threatening anyone, I'm saying what I'm reading, if this guy gets a bad rep *(he certainly is at least in this subreddit, and it isn't a stretch to think this will be mentioned in other MTG forums)* it will impact badly on his sales, how's that a threat? 




 I've seen a lot of comments complaining about this, the option is there in control settings. In Spanish it has a misleading name (something that in English would translate to "previous car weapon", in Spanish it sounds like it's taking about in-car-built weapons) and assuming the amount of comments I'm seeing here about this matter I'm assuming it also does on English.  

It's among the top 5, just set it to mouse wheel down and you can go back and forth with pistols, grenades, etc on your car with your wheel. Pretty useful, I don't know why this isn't default.  

Cheers! 




 I'm pretty sure you are doing this in order to get money from Tobias, but I can see why you are and will continue to deny this. 

You will say that money isn't your primary interest in this course of action, but you know it is. Look, I'm not looking for you to admit it, I'm just saying that you and everyone else here know what's this about. So, I'm going to tell you that besides this being the biggest jerk move I've heard in quite some time, and apart from me criticizing the lack of ethics in your actions (which clearly is a topic you don't care about), I'm going to speak your language: this is a terrible, terrible decision economically-wise for your business.     

Reddit is a huge platform, and you should consider that gaining bad reputation here can really hurt your business. And I mean **really**. The word will come out and a lot of people in the MTG niche will stop buying from you, and as I know you don't care about justice or whatever justification you want to tag on this dick move, but only about gaining more money, I am telling you this is one of the worst ways to accomplish that. You may gain some cash from OP, but that's nothing compared to what you will lose against a angry community that will boicott your operation by not buying anymore.  

So, in the slim chance you'll reply to this, I know you are going to say money isn't your goal here etc etc. But yeah, you, me, and everyone else here knows that's just gibberish. Consider what I'm saying to you, it's in your business best interest.
