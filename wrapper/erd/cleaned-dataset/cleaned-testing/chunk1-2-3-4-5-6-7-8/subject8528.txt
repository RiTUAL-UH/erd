 I know that the typical response to this is that I should wait for the games to possibly go on sale as a flash, daily or community deal but the fact of the matter is that it is winding down. 
  
What are some good games that have yet to, or won't, be featured that people should get?  
  
.

.

Some examples would be: FUEL and "The Last Remnant" for the former is good with the refueled mod and the latter is an older game.

I am not looking for anything in particular but general suggestions. 









 This is the start of the second season after the recap of the first two seasons last episode.

This is the world where Shinku selected, "Do not wind" and he is now in college while his other self, in another timeline, asks him for help. 




 This seems to be an alternate take on the series. We see Shinku and Sugintou show up which seems similar to the first series.
What are your thoughts?

Also, the ~desu begins. Semi-Official "desu" count: 14

I recently finished the game and I was wondering what people did at the very end of game when you go into the room with the doctors. They were, seemingly unarmed, but after all one had been through what did you do and why did you do it? 




 This is a MASSIVE (42,000+) batch of hits. It does require a qualification hit that pops up every once and a while. Almost perfect TO! 

http://adf.ly/R7ZuG (You should be able to find the qualification hit here too as it is just a search for the requester name) As of this time, the qualification hit is not up.

I have done about 300+ from them and they all approved! 




 Near perfect TO. http://adf.ly/QnGc4

I got a pretty good bonus from them!

 **What is it?**

The app is called Tooyoou and it is currently in open beta which uses some of your homescreen to send you ads. Here is a [link](http://tooyoou.com/howitworks) to the site where it explains how it works.

**How do I earn?**

You earn by installing the application and having a widget on your homescreen. In this widget, they will show various ads that do not have any sound or distracting flashing. If you click on each new ad that comes through that is setup to pay for clicking on it you earn $0.10 and you seem to get about half a cent through just having it shown. 

**What are some caveats?**

The main issue that I could find is that it could be a big data hog so I would suggest using it when you are on Wifi or on an actual unlimted plan. I, personally, do not know how it impacts battery life for I am using an old android phone which is always plugged in.

**How fast can you earn?**

Personally, I just joined the application and in the span of about ten or so minutes I have earned $0.62. It rotates a new ad every ten minutes or if you do any of the following:

	Connectivity to data or wireless network has changed.

	You have checked your account balance.

	You have saved your preferences using Your Choice.

**What is this Your Choice?**

It is their way of having targeted ads pointed your way. What you do is state your general age, gender and interests thus the ads will change accordingly. It is optional and only if you want to see targeted ads.

**How can you get paid?**

It appears that you can be paid once a month through Paypal. You must have a pending balance of $5.00 for it to send the money to your Paypal account. You can also download apps to earn points but I do not know the point to dollar ratio for you must have 2500 points to get a gift card. From the website where I found out about the application, the poster claimed that they have been using it for five or so months and have gotten about $450 from it all. I, personally, cannot vouch for this amount of earning for I am quite new to it. I am mainly submitting it here so that other people can find out about it.

**Where can I find this application?**

You can find it on the Google Play Store under the title Tooyoou or at this [link.]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tooyoou.android hl=en)

**Is there a referral system?**

Not that I could find! Good luck in earning! 









 **What is "Digital Generation"?**

It is a software program is one that works through distributed computing. Thankfully, you will always get the same amount per day no matter the computer regardless of the overall processing speed. You do have to download their software, but you can just run it in the background. I haven't had an impact on performance or anything of that sort. Currently, it is running any only using 40MB of my RAM, much less than that of a web browser or most other software.
  
**What is this I see about $50 a thread?**

To earn money, you have to have a thread open to use. Each thread gives you $1 per day if the computer is on for 24 hours.  

**Well crap, I do not want to pay! How can I earn?**

To get a trial thread (30 Days), you must provide a cell phone number for them to send a SMS to. If you do not get a SMS, just send a ticket to the admin by clicking on the "Tickets" tab.  

**What if I do not want to send them my cell phone number?**

You can do what I did and use a Google Voice number. This requires a Google account and you can access it at [voice.google.com](http://voice.google.com) and it is free if you are in the US or Canada.  

**How do you get paid?**
You can get paid through any of the following:

* Paxum
* Perfect Money
* Payza
* Paypal ~ NOT YET! Slated to be added by/on June 15^th  

**Do you have any payment proof?**

No, I am fairly new to the site, but when submitting a ticket the admin seemed professional and quick to respond to my problem.

**How can I sign up?**

You can either sign up through my [referral](https://coingeneration.com/auth/new/100685/) or through this [non-ref link](https://coingeneration.com).


Even if you do not pay for a thread, you can earn up to $30.00 in a month through a purely passive method. 









 I am asking this, for I am wonder how people manage to stay sane on a plane for 12+ hours straight. I know of the in-flight entertainment, but how do you manage to pass the time?  

My reason for this is that I will be flying from the east coast of the US to Japan next year. This is not my first international flight, for I went from the same area to England and flew back from France but that was about ten years ago. (I am headed to Japan with a college class for two weeks.) 




 This time we get to see what happens when Misaka meets one of her clones.

What are your thoughts on the episode? 









 Finally a Hinagiku episode and all that it entailed.

What are your thoughts on the episode? 



















 I'm a Christian (Non-demonational), but I was wondering what God said about those who visit other, supposedly, sacred sites. I am asking this because it seems as though I will be traveling to Japan in May of 2014 and during the course of the trip, we will end up visiting a shinto shrine or two. (The course I am taking the trip with is about the culture of Japan.)
 














 Things other than a biological cycle. 









 Great episode, it is interesting to see the dynamic about how the crowd on Akibastar reacted to their return. I wonder how they are going to pull it off in terms of regaining ground next episode.     
    
  









 With Zetsuen no Tempest and my fondness for classical, I was wondering if there were any other anime out there that were entirely or 95% orchestral.

My MAL: http://myanimelist.net/animelist/bookkid900 



















 We finally find out that Manami did not pass the audition and some good character development for Ryuunosuke. 




 https://www.mturk.com/mturk/searchbar?selectedSearchType=hitgroups searchWords=hubpages minReward=0.00 x=-935 y=-89

This is the screening test for the "HubPages" batch hits. When you complete the "Request Qualification" information you can begin to work on these 15 hits. Each are about a minute or less in length and pay $0.25. If you pass the screening test you receive a bonus of $10. If you almost pass you receive a bonus of $2.

Once you pass, you can begin to work on the main hubpages hits. Depending on your accuracy you can be paid anywhere from $0.20 to $2.60 extra for every ten hits that you complete.

**EDIT: It seems as though you guys killed the screening test hits.** 




 What do you think the PS4 will cost at launch? 









 We get to see a number of important things this episode:
 
1. Mimori is the new Mariko
1. There are hints of "Mariko" becoming a sadist. (It could be Tsubasa or Mimori since they have both had the same name.)
1. The Photographer is a spy.
1. The conditions for the "Center Nova" phenomenon:
 * A concert with combat
 * An atmospheric disturbance
 * Large quantities of high-purity dualium crystals.
1. The group will be attacked on their home turf next episode. 

What are your thoughts? 




 I recently discovered this trick because I routinely get shocked trying to open the door to my bathroom. Since the metal takes the shock, you do not get the pain from the discharge.

**NOTE:** Do NOT use a key that has a button on it! The discharge may cause problems for the internal circuits! 














 This was a pretty good episode. We were able to see the resolve of the three main girls in going forth with their plan even when almost no one showed up to their concert. Also, this is probably the starting point for the rest of the group to be formed for the girls who were in the OP/ED were all at the concert at the end of the song.

What are your thoughts on the episode? 




 I forgot that this game was coming out until I saw it on Amazon.com it looks really good. The two major reviews that are out are giving really high marks to it and it sounds like you can spend a lot of time playing it. Personally, I am a fan of anime so the graphics and general aesthetic is towards my interests. Also, I like JRPGs and the like too. 




 You do not have the provide context but it would be appreciated. 

Names are not important for it is the words that they have spoken/written that matter in this case.

Preferably, it would not be from someone famous or well known. 









 Why do some games have an open community for new players while others are hostile? What makes players tick a certain way?


The thing that prompted this was that I started to play "Go" online and the people I have met there have been more than willing to help me progress and learn. Why can't other video games take this openness and run with it? Everyone starts out where they are no good at said game whether it is on a console/PC or offline.
 









 I am looking at possibly getting a 3DS or saving for a next gen console (Wii U or PS4). I already have a PS Vita and have been playing that off and on.

In terms of games, I have a whole bunch of DS games from years ago. If I were to get a 3DS, I would also look at eventually getting Paper Mario, MK 7, SM3DL, LoZ:OOT, NSMB2 and maybe Pokemon Black Ver. 2 since I haven't played a pokemon since yellow edition.

Thing is, I do not know how the third party support will be for the console since the games that I am looking at are all first party... 




 This could be anything from a reference to some background characters without any voice having a story of their own. 









 **EDIT: Today, December 25th, the credits are being slow and may not show up until later today!**



First off, many of you may already know about this site and such, but this is for those who do not or who were not able to use it prior to this Christmas.

There is a site called "freemyapps" and what they do is pay you credits that you can redeem for gift cards and the like. You do not have to pay for any of the apps, unlike some other sites of this type. Their payout rate is 300 credits = $1. Some apps may be worth up to 450 credits though they hover at about 160ish. **NOTE:** It seems as though the Android apps are paying, on average, about 100 per download and are lower than that of iOS users.

To get the points, you go to the site, then you download the app from clicking on the link. That will then take you to the App Store / Play Store for you to download the application. Once it is downloaded and installed you have to open it for at least 30 seconds. It can be a bit finicky so just check after about 45 seconds or so. 

Personally, I wish that I had found the site sooner for I have been able to earn about $15 on amazon from them in the span of three days. (This has been paying more than mTurk, Swagbuck and Bing and in less time.) [PROOF](http://i.imgur.com/ISmKY.jpg)

NOTE: They install a "profile" which assigns your device ID or phone to an account but you do not have to provide a name or address for it.

Here are the links: [Non-Ref](http://m.freemyapps.com) | [Ref](http://m.freemyapps.com/share/url/b86f2818) 

**NOTE:** You must open the above links on your iOS/Android apps.  




 I am looking into getting PDf off of Amazon soon and I am wondering what you guys/girls think about the game. (I have played the previous ones on my PSP) Also, I have never imported anything before so I do not know what to expect. 









 https://www.mturk.com/mturk/searchbar?selectedSearchType=hitgroups searchWords=Victoria+Shaffer minReward=0.00 x=0 y=0

Took me about 6.5 minutes to complete.

Excellent TO.

No AC or MC. 














 Another great episode, this time focusing on Aika and Mahiro's relationship as remembered by Mahiro's dreams. In terms of plot progression, there wasn't a lot but it shows the lengths that the two took to hide their relationship. 

What are your thoughts? 




 If possible, I would be interested in seeing the data that my time on Reddit has created. Odds are my top subreddit would be /r/anime, so if it is something different it would cool to know what it is. 









 I, personally, really like it but I feel that the timing window is too small. You cannot have the same timing window as the main game on this mode. For, there can be too much on the screen to accurately see the patterns. (I mainly play 7 key) 




 I have been using the ATH-M50 headphones for about a year and a half now, but even since getting a DAC (The Audioengine D1) I've realized that there is more to hear that these headphones cannot fully reproduce. What would be a good headphone to go to from here?

**Budget:** Max of $400.00 (Though if there is something that is slightly above that amount it should be fine.)

**Usage:** I plan on using them on my computer to watch videos and listen to music. I am in a dorm so some isolation would be good and I have to travel to home on breaks.

**What do I listen to?** - I listen to anything from Jazz to Rock (Not Metal) to Classical. (I do not listen to R B or Rap)

I am looking for headphones that can accurately reproduce the recorded sound rather than adding in extra bass. 




 Wow, I was not expecting that reaction at the end of the episode from Komari. I liked the touch where the flashback at the end was mainly instrumental with only the phrase spoken by her brother as "This was all a dream".

What are your thoughts on this episode? 




 Has anyone else come across someone with a PAX icon next to their name when you look at them? I'm assuming that this means that they visited the booth at PAX. 
 




 For those of us that use Bing rewards, they are doubling the number of points today for searches. Whether or not it will be like thing until halloween is beyond me.

If you have yet to sign up for Bing rewards, it is a simple way to earn a little bit of money on the side. You can get, normally, up to 15 points a day by searching on Bing but today it is up to 30.

To sign up for bing: [non-ref](http://www.bing.com/rewards) | [ref](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9778718 rrid=_494e93a3-713d-1529-7052-79d2a1f0330c

 I have never played a Persona game before, but I keep on seeing this game popup across the web. I do like a good JRPG, but I am worried that the enemies would be too frightening to be able to play it. The Japanese setting and such won't bother me so that is a non-issue. I would rather buy golden than the PS2 version because I have a vita. Also, since it is portable I'd be able to play it on the go.

Thanks in advance! 














 In my case, it would have to be during my Sci-Fi and Philosophy course last semester. The teacher brought up [Innocence](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY-A0Bt1fUg feature=plcp) after showing the tupac chochella thing. (It was to show how that, the tupac thing, was not entirely new but this type of thing is starting to occur.)

As predicted, everyone else in the class was freaking out thinking that this was extremely weird. Though in my case, I was just wanting to remember the song title to look it up later. 




 If anyone had an extra Civ V game from their Xcom preorder gift and would like to give it away, I would be more than glad to use it. 




 Great episode to start this off. Some pretty good comedy and weird/random parts. The Konami code (Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A) [Note: They left out the start...] for the vending machine was pretty funny.

Art wise, it seems to be a simpler but still detailed style when compared to Hyouka.

Your thoughts? 














 It took about a month from submitting it to it actually getting here, but it was worth it. The magnets are valued at $38.24 on their website. The case is well made, but I have yet to open it. 









 If you have a video link, please post it! 









 Gifts do not count.


In my case, it would have to be the Clannad:The Complete Collection. I would have gotten Toradora, but I am waiting it out in hopes that NISA will eventually release the bluray version in the states. 




 My story/example:

I am helping move in freshmen at my university and we had to get here early. Before one of the prep tasks that we had to do, I was coming out of lunch and someone was playing the OP to After Story on the Steinway piano up near the gym/starbucks. I ran up there and listened to him play for a while and said something about Clannad. He just laughed and started to play the OP to the first season. Meanwhile, there is a freshman's mom sitting near by bobbing her head to the music and I doubt that she knew that it was from an anime.  




 There have to be some interesting stories out there regarding this.

--------------


**My story**:


My university has an on campus steakhouse and it is part of your meal plan. As such, since the meal plan resets every week, you can go once a week. Being the person that I am, I wanted to take advantage of this for all that it is worth. 

A few months pass since starting my freshman year and I had gone every single week. Most of the time I was alone, so I would sit at the bar like area of the steakhouse and talk to the waiters and waitesses. One of the waiters, a gentleman who I guess to be in his mid to late fifties, knew that I was a Computer Science major and asked me if I had ever heard of Reddit. I answered no and went on with my meal. Later that night, I went on to Reddit and saw somethings that I'd rather not see and got off. 

A few more months pass and I was asked again by the very same waiter if I had gone on. I said that I did, but ran into somethings that I'd rather not see. He just chuckled and stated that I should give it another shot. Well, I did as such and here I am.

**TL;DR** Was told about Reddit from an older waiter at the on campus steakhouse. 









 I am new to turking, and I am wondering how long it normally takes for you for the HIT to go from Approved - Pending Payment to paid? 



















 I realize that this is requested a lot but I have seem to have run out of ones to watch. I am looking for a good comedy romance series without a lot of fanservice (Meaning no High School DxD or Maken-Ki eque series)

My current anime list is here: http://myanimelist.net/animelist/bookkid900 




 The text will state to following:

BEST - BUY CUSTOMER: You've been chosen for a 1K Reward to use at any location. To claim go to [WEBSITE REDACTED]   enter 9791

I just got one of these and nothing other than a whois leading to some building in LA comes up when searching for the website. 














 Some examples of this would have to be:
 * Mahou Sensei Negima
 * Hayate no Gotoku
 * The World God Only Knows

I really like it when the creator of a series puts these things in so that it seems like a "Just as planned" scenario.

EDIT: Added TWGOK. 
























 With the introduction of the E3 PDf demo and its inclusion in the Sony PS Vita Sizzle Reel (See [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fEX9-LR9tg feature=player_detailpage#t=101s) ) I would like to start a discussion on the possibility of an international release of PDf.

My thoughts are that, if anything, it would be announced at Anime Expo. For, according to what I have seen on the official Hatsune Miku Facebook page, they seem to have a lot of vocaloid related things there. (I realize that vocaloid and anime go, semi, hand-in-hand with one another but this, to me, seems as though it is more than just that. )

So, /r/Vocaloid what are your thoughts on this? 
























 This was my old username on multiple sites and it would be interesting to see what people do with the 900 part of it. :D 



















 Like the question states, I'd like to know if it is possible to have the original nook that has 3G and wifi become a mobile router and provide internet for a laptop or other device? Thanks in advance! 




 We all get these times where it feels as though you have watched everything or become tired with the medium as a whole. How do you get over this "slump" or "Anime block"?

I normally, get over it by looking up recommendations online or even going back to the various charts for the various seasons of anime in the past. 














 Well, me being an idiot, I let a friend borrow my 16gb flash drive and when she returned it, Windows wants to format it to only 64MB of storage space.

Note, I have tried the following:
*  HP USB Format Tool
*  Bootice
*  Disk Management (Windows)

At this rate, I am willing to boot into linux and fit it over there... 









 I have heard a lot of good things about "The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky" but I do not know whether or not to get that or get Disgaea 3 when it comes out on Tuesday.

 I have loved SRPGs since I played about 25 hours worth of Final Fantasy Tactics A2 on my DS many years ago. 

Also, I have about 60 or so in my PSN account, though I am trying to save 15 for Tony Hawk Pro Stater HD... Though, if you guys/girls state that I need to get both, then it is possible to do so. 



















 I am using g++ to compile C++ code for a project for school and I am getting, without quotes, "goodie.cpp:(.text+0xc): undefined reference to 'create()' "

 I saw the post about someone getting scammed by using a similar username. (The old seeing "nn" as "m" when you glance at it) This way it won't get buried in comments and people can see it.

How to avoid getting scammed:

1. Download [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com)

2. See the person who you are getting pizza for and tag their username. (Or even do it by setting a color for their username!)

3. Use that tag to make sure the PM's line up. 

4. ???

5. Pizza. (For the correct person!)

 I know that this is a weird question but as I was taking a shower yesterday I had the thought of, "How in the world do things dry out without extra heat? Because water, in order to become a gas needs to reach 212F or 100C. I realize it is due to evaporation but how does it occur?" 














 I remember my dad playing this game a long time ago (1998ish) and I cannot remember the name of it. I do remember the following:
* It had a "boss" type thing that was a round cylinder that rotated and spewed fireballs.
* You had to fly around a pick up keys to open other rooms with keys.

It scared me as a kid and now I want to beat the game to get my "revenge". 









 Back in October I got this email:

-----------------------------------
Note: I removed the links and hid my channel's link so that it doesn't seem that I am doing it for ad revenue. 

Also, the video in question only had 5,000 views while another at the time that I had that went semi-viral back in 2010 had about 150k. 





























 My guess is that it will air in January. I've noticed over the past six or so years of watching currently airing anime that the vast majority of the time when they announce a show it is one full season away from airing. 

The actual explanation of this is that they do not want to lose the hype from the fanbase for the second season by making them wait. Yes, there are some outliers such as Grisaia (Which is finally airing this season) and Dog Days''' (Airing this January) both of which were announced years ago. 




 For those of you who are "out of the loop", [have a look at this](http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/23hraj/ghandi_nukes_and_civilization_v/) which explains the above comments. 




 As a heads up, mentioning illegal streaming/downloading sites is the same as linking them and it is not allowed in the rules. Any and all posts mentioning these types of sites will be removed. 




 [They knew all along.](http://brawlinthefamily.keenspot.com/2008/07/11/050-gooey-kablooie/) 




 How about Toradora? It is regarded as a really good romance/comedy anime. 




 Most apps don't unless you press a button to bring it up. 




 Considering that there are only five characters in the demo it should be a 20% chance, but I agree that it tends to prefer certain characters. 




 Thing is, he returns nothing as he is void. 




 I got it for them, but I hope people remember to tag their posts. (It could have also been someone submitting it from an app and they haven't seen the sidebar yet.) 




 They went over that by saying, "How would you explain this to them?". 




 That was the PS3. The PS3 used the cell architecture which was new for the PS3, this is what made it hard for valve.

The PS4, on the other hand, uses a 64 bit architecture and the OS is a certain distro/version of linux. Valve has been pouring a lot into putting their games, and others, on Linux. (What do you think SteamOS is?)
 




 According to the first season, she is a college student. I am not sure why she looked younger in the first season, other than she is short. 




 Getting the "internet" to agree on something is like trying to herd cats, it just isn't going to happen. 




 Not only that but it has a new OP and ED song and animation. It would be a bit silly to make something new when they could just reuse the old versions. My guess is that they are looking for sales of the blu-ray version to help spur a second season. 




 It seems interesting. I wish it was scaned/translated. 




 Now go read the novels. (You can buy them in English! Well, not all of them but they are translating all of them!)
 




 I've had the opportunity to meet him and he seems to be nice but reserved. He did kick my butt in Melee though. (4 stock against me.) 




 Not only that but you can shorten it to what you did.

 Please properly mark your spoilers using the spoiler tag rather than "WARNING! SPOILERS!". The proper spoiler tag is in the sidebar. (IF you can't read the sidebar for some reason it would be: [(Ep.1)]-(#s "Pikachu") Without the dash between the brackets and the parenthesis.  




 You think they would test a random bloodstain for DNA or something. (Then again, they probably don't have a record of Hime's DNA) 




 If you don't get it, "lead" has multiple meanings, most people would think of the verb not the noun in this case.

 Something something Peach problem. 




 90 degrees - There you go, an angle. :P 




 True story: My weekend has been horrible so far, and I'm not talking about not getting a code or anything.  
My computer broke because the bootloader got corrupted. Even reinstalling Windows didn't fix the issue! Getting a code would make my weekend since I was unable to try and get a code otherwise.

 Could someone please send me a code? This weekend has been horrible so far. My computer broke, for the bootloader got corrupted. Even reinstalling Windows didn't fix the issue. Getting a code would make my weekend. I can provide proof that my computer is broken with a picture of my computer showing the error and my username on a post-it note.

 My second favorite "genre" or trope of sorts is when someone gets sent to an alternate world where they have to either try and survive or figure out a way back.

Some notable anime examples:

* [Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5781/Isekai_no_Seikishi_Monogatari)
* [Oda Nobuna no Yabou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11933/Oda_Nobuna_no_Yabou)
* [Monaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara kuru Sou Desu yo?](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15315/Mondaiji-tachi_ga_Isekai_kara_Kuru_Sou_Desu_yo)
* [Outbreak Company](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19369/Outbreak_Company)

A notable manga:

* [Gate: Thus the JSDF Fought There](http://myanimelist.net/manga/41733/Gate:_Jieitai_Kanochi_nite_Kaku_Tatakeri)

Not exactly necessary, but I would like some romance/comedy aspect(s) to it.

[Here](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/bookkid900) is a link to my MAL. It is a little out of date, but most of what I have seen is on there. 




 Full List - The ones in bold are some of my must watch anime.

* The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya
* Nyoron Churuya-san
* Good Luck! Ninomiya-kun
* Kiddy GiRL-AND
* **Lucky Star**

* *The Mystic Archives of Dantalian - Heard good things, but I haven't seen it myself.*
* Otogi-Soushi (Manga 2.5) 




 Testing automod settings. 














 A bit of an odd question but I thought I should ask it here. My Mother, who is an elementary school media specialist (as she teaches more than just books), is looking to get a few series for the library. These would be, mainly, for fourth and fifth graders.

I know Shounen Jump would be a good place to start but even then some of the content could be iffy.

There are other graphic novels (not manga) in the library but I do not know what ones. 

Possible ideas: Azumanga Dioh, Yotsuba! 




 I came across a thread on GameFaqs that you can use a DAC on the PS4 by just plugging it in. 

I tried it for myself and it worked! (Quite well too.) I am unsure of whether or not you have to change the audio output to bitstream, which I did before trying, but it worked.


I tried the Audioengine D1 but I would imagine that others would work too.

---

You may be asking yourself, why does the PS4 have this and not mp3/flac/wav/ogg support? My guess is that since the PS4's OS is based off of linux they kept the drivers needed for this to work. (Heck, it is probably part of the kernel) 




 . 




 I've made up my mind to get the HD650's but I saw that people recommended getting a DAC/amp for them. I *already own* the Audioengine D1 but I was wondering how well the two go together and if it has enough power to run the HD650's. (The D1 is also an amp) 









 I normally sit in the chat of a group that I am in, along with ~10-20 others, which makes it into a sort of IRC thing. 

The issue is that for the past few days every single link except for youtube.com and steampowered.com results in having to [click through Steam's website](https://i.imgur.com/8yWhm3z.png) to get to the actual link. Even imgur is being affected by this.

I only click links I trust and from people I know. I just want it to stop as it adds anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds extra loading time. (Having to load the page, click the button, wait for the actual site to load.) When you normally click anywhere from 10 to 15 links or more a night it adds up to be quite a bit of time. 




 I bought Contraption Maker ($15 value) and it, apparently, comes with a copy to give to someone. Since the game gave me a second copy, each copy is worth $7.50 so I'm just asking for a $5 amazon gift card. (Paypal and Bitcoin are also options)

If you ever played the old Incredible Machine series, this is in the same vein and it is even made by some of the people who worked on that series. 

This trade will occur through Steam since it is a gift.

 This is a song from the newest episode of "Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun" in which one of the characters is renowned for their singing voice. The song seems to be in Italian. 

The show provided a glimpse of the [sheet music](https://i.imgur.com/yO7qni3.jpg), which I have turned into a [MIDI file](https://mega.co.nz/#!g5plQapA!B7nxW6wSOAWdcOCbSk_G7jhn5EtL0oq7Hy63Kqpuwsw) and it matches her singing.

 I have an old HP Touchpad running Cyanogenmod (Android 4.0.4) but in the Google Play Store, it states that the current version does not support this device. I know from looking around online that the HP Touchpad works for perktv and I would like to get it running on it. 
 



















 OP of the [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/27sw0l/introducing_rumble_make_videos_and_get_paid/) here with an update on my payment status.

Initially, I thought that you were paid on the Friday of the week that you requested but that is not the case. Once you "Cash out" they pay you the Friday AFTER you do so. Also, the minimum cash out is $50.

I had a video get approved and I was paid $125 two weeks ago. I was paid on June 20th. (It just turned midnight here) 

[Here is my proof from Paypal.](http://i.imgur.com/FxhYjX7.jpg) 




 I feel as though I have seen most if not all of the entire comedy/romance genre that is geared towards guys. I try to avoid shows with gratuitous fan service (DxD, etc...).

Some examples of ones I really enjoyed:

* Toradora
* Clannad 
* White Album 2
* Seitokai no Ichizon
* True Tears

[Here is my MAL](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/bookkid900)

To help slim down and make is easier to find what ones I have seen, I also have a list of just Comedy/Romance shows [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Ah64P40sBB2KdHYxQ0N6QmNlenZHLW8xaFNiZWRsQmc output=html) (It is on Google Docs) 




 I am trying to setup PerkTV on my old Droid X2 running CM10 Alpha 3 but none of the actual videos play. The ads do, but none of the ones that result in points.

I was getting the android.process.media error and I did a factory restore prior to this.

What can I do to get this to work? 














 This is a site I came across and decided to give it a try. I uploaded a [video](https://rumble.com/v2z7i1-the-worlds-busiest-intersection.html) that I had to the site last night and I got an [email](http://i.imgur.com/hxTH9oa.png) today stating that I received $125 for that video.

 **What is Rumble?**

It is a video hosting site, much like YouTube and Vimeo, but they have partners such as MTV, Xbox, MSN, Yahoo, etc.. As such they are paying users to submit their videos for them to then use on and with these partners. If your video is approved, you get $50 but if your video is good enough to be put on the front page they will pay you $100+.

---

**How can I earn money on Rumble?**  
There are four different ways for you to monetize your video(s):

 * **Profit Sharing** - You give all rights to Rumble and earn 90% of the earnings on YouTube and 60% of the earnings from their partners.  
 * **Exclusive** - You give all rights to Rumble and can make up to $1000.
 * **Non-Exclusive** (This is what I did) - You keep your rights to your video and can make up to $500. This grants Rumble a non-exclusive license to your video. (ie. They can still use it with their partners, but you still own it.)
 * **Not for Sale** - Who'd want to do that?

--

**What is Rumble looking for in a video?**

* Good title and description  
 * They changed my title and description, but make sure it is a good one such that the editors know what it is about.
* *Original content*
* High Quality Video (ie. Something that looks nice rather than thrown together.)

---
**What if I don't have any videos to upload?**  

 * You can make about $0.25 a day through tagging videos. (5 videos a day at $0.05 per)  
 * You could always make a video to upload.

 First off, I have been looking at getting a Wii U for a few months now and have saved up money on Amazon to get it.
---
---
In terms of next-gen consoles, I already have a PS4. This is what I will use for most multi-platform games.


Last year I got the 3DS and I loved being able to play the new Mario and Zelda games along with titles such as Fire Emblem, Rune Factory 4 and Mario Kart 7.  

I really want to get Mario Kart 8 which in turn will allow me to get WW:HD for free and to get the new Smash Bros down the road, but I am not sure if these games warrant a $300 console.  
--

Wii U games I am looking at getting: 

* New Zelda (The one to be announced at E3)
* New Super Mario/Luigi Bros U (Comes with the bundle)
* Super Mario 3D World
* Mario Kart 8
* Super Smash Bros for Wii U
* The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD (Free w/ MK8)
* Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze

With the MK8 Promotion, it has lessened the time that I have to make a decision as the free game helps.

 I am trying to change my password as I forget it but the recover password email isn't showing up. I am using gmail for my account and I have checked my spam and such to no avail.

Others seem to be having this issue but they remembered their passwords and changed it themselves... 









 Whenever I try to upvote or downvote nothing happens. I was using RES and I disabled it but the issue is still there. Not only that, but when I try to click on "Text" when making a post nothing happens. I was only able to get around it by using AlienBlue.

I am using the latest version of google chrome.

Thank you for any help that you can provide regarding this matter. 




 ~~What this does is disable external Direct X 3D rendering.~~  
~~It is another source engine trick that people use (mainly for Dota 2) to help speed up their game.~~  
~~Due to using this, my FPS has doubled.~~

~~You want to put this in your launch options in Origin.~~

~~The only caveat is that ALT+Tab-ing is slower than what it was before.~~

Apparently it does diddly squat. 














 It seems to me that the enemies are way too accurate for this sort of game, even more so for the bosses. It almost seems as though all of my deaths were cheap compared to those in Infamous 1/2.

There was a boss where I had to hang off a ledge and abuse the fact that you could fire through the ground in order to take the boss down. 




  I am the form of my sword 

 Smoke is my body and neon is my blood 

 I have created over a thousand blades 

 Unknown to Death, Nor known to Life 

 Have withstood hellfire to create many weapons 

 Yet, those hands will never hold anything 

 So as I pray, unlimited blade works.

 What does the Bible say about visiting other religion's festivals/occasions?

The reason I am asking is that I am going on a two week study abroad trip to Japan in May. While we are in Japan, there is a [big shinto festival](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanja_Matsuri) that they have figured out a way for us to go see. While no one in the class will be partaking in this from a religious perspective, nevertheless we will be there. As such, I am unsure of what the Bible says to do in these sorts of situations.

Could anyone, if they are knowledgeable in this, be willing to share their thoughts on this matter? 




 I just got out of a CTF match on Rise where it seemed as though everyone else was locked to the ground while I was able to run along the corridors, above the action, getting [all six flags.](http://i.imgur.com/uWWLvPM.jpg)

The way they did the training mode was good, where it introduces wall-running before combat (where people would just leave since they think they know what they are doing) but there is little reminding people about these mechanics.

I know that after awhile, people will begin to use the wall running to their advantage but as of now it is quite silly to see a match go like that. 




 Let's see what happens today after the incident with the onsen last episode. 









 If you applied to be in the closed alpha/beta, go check your email as they are being sent out!

It should be interesting to see how the music and FPS parts are being tied together.

 While this subreddit has, somewhat, fallen by the wayside its intended purpose was to form a subreddit where those who play/mod the FUEL video game can talk about it.

All posts about other things will be removed without warning. 




 I am looking for a good JRPG that will be fun to play.

RF4: I haven't played any other games in the series, but I have played Animal Crossing. (I haven't played AC in a while)

M L: I played, and loved, Superstar Saga back on the GBA and I had Bowser's Inside Story but I never got too far in that one.

Bravely Default: This the JRPG that everyone has been hyping up for a while, especially since it has been out in Europe for awhile.

---
My experiences with JRPGs: I really like them, but after a while I either transition off to other games or get suck (like in Star Ocean on the 360/PS3). The closest that I have gotten to beating a JRPG was: Superstar Saga, Ar Tonelico: Qoga, Paper Mario and the Thousand Year Door and also some of the recent Zelda games.

The only one I finished, and due to using action replay, was Final Fantasy IV for the DS. 




 I recently got into Dogecoin and I have ~10 doge that I am trying to send to Cryptsy. When I try and send the entire amount (or less for that matter) I get an error stating, "Error: Transaction creation failed". I am on the 1.4.1 release of the wallet software and it has just finished downloading about 30k block records. 

Is there anything that I can do to fix this?

------------------------------------

PS: I looked in the related subreddits guide to see if there was a tech support one and I also checked for an IRC to go on but I didn't find anything. I've also searched online for a solution to no avail. 

Hopefully this sort of post is okay here as I didn't see anything regarding it in the rules section. 




 Well, let's see what SHAFT has in store for this week as the fake couple has been formed! 














 For those of you who have been on /r/beermoney for a while, you may remember when some people came on and promised a new and better rewards/survey site. Nothing really came of it and for the past few months the subreddit, /r/MegaPoints, had been set as private.

Hopefully this means that the site will be coming to fruition in the near future.

***

**NOTE:** I am not affiliated with megapoints, I just happened to remember about it and decided to check to see if anything was new. 














 I am, currently, in the process of having the program process the data after downloading the full English Wikipedia file(s), but I do not know where it is in the grand scheme of things. 

It would be nice to have a progress bar/screen (like it had when downloading the 10Gb file) letting the user know how much longer and such it has for processing. 




 While this may seem to be a "Well, duh" thing but you cannot setup remote play on the Vita while you are on a different network. I had the correct numbers so that I could connect to it, but to no avail.

I attempted to setup remote play on my Vita using skype as my PS4 is six hours away by car and I cannot get to it until the middle of December. (Due to the reports of issues, I had my Mom set it up to make sure it all worked) 














 Will you have your PS4 shipped home or to your university? 

The reason I am asking is that I am torn between having it sent home, or if I should get it shipped here. My main concern is that it would interfere with my studying for finals. (Which start on December 6^th ) Yet, if I have it shipped home, I might be too antsy around finals about finally being able to play it.

Also, if you do respond, could you state when your finals are? 




 Subs are out! I am looking forward to see if he thinks that he is an invader or not. 









 So far, and I am about 6 minutes in, the episode is pretty good and *seemingly* better than last week's.

I found the whole *Jaws*-esque theme and the [profile picture for "god"](http://i.imgur.com/En6G8lI.jpg) in his cell phone were pretty funny. 




 I, recently, made a post on the /r/games subreddit with a link and when I looked at the vote distribution. I noticed something really weird, [I had a negative downvote.](http://i.imgur.com/yzYWBxm.png)

Well, someone must of either fixed the bug or downvoted it such that it is back to having 0 downvotes. 



















 This has been an idea of mine for a while, but I think it would be a good idea to have either on the wiki or on some image, a list of anime that are similar to other shows on television. 

This would allow people who are new to anime to find a common ground rather than having to guess and possible turned away from it.
 









 For those of you who have clicked on this and wondering what in the world I am talking about, there was a post up about a month ago about it on this subreddit. [Here is a link to that post](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1ktmvf/get_some_steady_brewfunds_seeking_privatecharter/).

TL;DR: It is a panel that asks those on the panel to respond to a question with five or more sentences. Once they read over and approve your response, they will send you a link to redeem a $25 gift card for another site where you can get gift cards ranging from Amazon to iTunes. This will happen once a month for the next year, well 11 months from this point in time.

 I have been looking into getting Tales of the Abyss for the 3DS for a little while. I have played Tales of Xillia on my PS3 and I really like it so far but I was wondering if I should get Tales of the Abyss for my 3DS. 

I really lime JRPGs but I never really seems to finish them. 


So, what are your thoughts? 


































 Heck, I would skip the work from selling the costumes and just keep on making gold and other important resources that I can then sell.  




 Okay, who put the Flintstones into anime? 




 Thing is, it is a gigantic series of shows if you decide to delve into the "Nasuverse". 

Here is /r/anime's guide on how to get into the Fate series: http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/seriesfaq-fate 




 A few things of note:

* You may want to fix your typos
* Try to keep titles consistent
* Remove the unnecessary capitalization 


A bit of a personal thing, but I cannot see Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu Season 2 being better than Toradora. Heck, the characters were worse than the first season.
  




 I hope this does well, this seems to be a shounen take on Marvel/DC comics which is really interesting.  




 Shouldn't the free space move down one? 




 Other than some OEL stuff and some light novels, the first volume of manga that I bought was Volume 1 of Nisekoi while I was in Japan. (If manga were that cheap here, I would buy a lot more of it. It was ~$4 USD instead of the $10 it would be in English)

I know why it is more in the US, but I can still gripe about it. (Licensing it, translation, redrawing, cover design changes if needed, printing, advertising, shipping, etc)  




 I thought it was centimeters. (As such 15 cm is about 6 inches, which is the length of a dollar bill) 




 For those of you wondering [this is one of the frames](http://i.imgur.com/guof8lv.jpg) that shows what they are asking about.

It almost looks like Emiya's "Trace On" ability that was shown when repairing the heater and also when strengthening the poster when he was defending against Lancer. 




 Did anyone else see [this?!?!?!](http://i.imgur.com/guof8lv.jpg) During the part where Archer is preparing his sword/arrow/drill there was a series of ~6-8 frames where it flashes Emiya's "Trace On" but it has Archer's hand/arm behind it. 

I stepped through the frames and this is the clearest one that has them both in it.

NOTE: I haven't played UBW, so I have no idea if this is of major importance. 




 Berser-car reminds me of Bowser Jr. from Super Smash Bros 4 with the small wheels, car with a face and cannon out the mouth. 




 The cigarettes would become lollipops with smoke coming out of them. 




 It is a light novel series in which each chapter is important to the story that they couldn't skip much, if any, of it. So far, there are 216 chapters out, 214 have been translated. To give the series its full worth, it would have to be a good number of episodes. (100 may be stretching it, but I would see 50+) 

The story also comprises the life of Rudeus starting from his infancy. 




 Not only that but some of the content would make it difficult to adapt. 




 Without compression, this is how it would turn out: The resolution would be 1280x720 so 345600 pixels. Since every color can be expressed by a 0-255 integer and there are three colors that comprise one pixel there are a total of 1036800 integers at a time. Considering that they can use an integer that only takes 8 bits of data (2^8 -1, which is 0-255) this means that a single frame takes up 1.037 MB. At thirty frames a second it would be 31.11 MB/s.

Now, this is why people have developed compression for video as you do not need to send every frame but only the pixels that have changed. 

---
For a true idea of the amount of data that it would take: According to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/1r6fz4/ps4ps_vita_remote_plays_uses_2030mbs_per_minute/) post on /r/vita the PS4-PS Vita uses ~20-30 MB per minute. (So anywhere from 0.33-0.5 MB/s) Odds are the PS4-PS4 uses the same idea and code as the PS4-Vita remote play so this should be about right.

EDIT: Removed trailing parenthesis and elaborated on the last sentence of the "Without compression" part. 




 The Clannad OST, along with Key's other works, is on the US iTunes right now. Key/VisualArts seems to be releasing all of their soundtracks and albums internationally. 




 There is also episode 3. 




 Bubblews is a mixed bag. Some love it while others claim it is just a big scam and if there is anything suspicious with your account, even if it isn't your fault, they will not pay you.

As for the foreign thing, I have no idea. 




 Nope. It was the first of their "Kinetic Novel" line, but it was not their first work. (Planetarian came out in 2006, while Clannad was out in 2004 and Kanon/Air even sooner.) 




 Huh, while I bought it used it seemed as though it was barely opened. Where you got yours from might have been a reprint or thrown away. 




 A little context for this, I found this slip within the booklet in the copy of the Clannad Soundtrack that I managed to find while I was in Japan. It seems to be announcing Key's "new" works such as Planetarian along with advertising their "current" games such as Air, Kanon, and Clannad.  









 Yeah, but that is only two seasons worth of episodes. (1 on, 1 off, 1 on) 




 It is where a series of two, or more, cour length is split over multiple seasons alternating whether it is airing or not.

Most of the time it just airs for a total of two seasons, but for the first time there is a series that is going to do split cour for a total of three seasons' worth of episode. (It will take five seasons to complete) It is the new Durarara anime that is doing this.  




 Shh, that never happened. It was never adapted until 2006. 




 Two seasons. (Each season is ~11-13 episodes long so this one will go for 22-26 episodes) 




 My guess is that we will know in due time.  




 I think OP is looking for an anime where the MC chooses everyone. (Not the sort of unknown end either) 









 For those of you wondering why I posted this, I decided to compare the fan translation/scan to the actual published volume to look for differences.

I found a few others but those are mainly details and the fan translation/scan cut a little bit off the top and bottom of the image. 




 That dang cat getting in on busting on Suzuki's well, uh, bust. 




 Do you have access to a black/whiteboard? One of the games that the anime club at my university plays is something along the lines of pictionary where you have one person draw something from a show and people have to guess where it is from or what character it is.

You'd have to have someone, who is running it, that pulls aside the person before they start drawing and ask them who/what they are going to draw so that when people guess you can judge whether it is right or wrong.

It is pretty fun and it can go for any length of time, but thirty minutes would be more than enough. 




 Rather than waiting for the third season that will never come, how about reading the light novels? They are available in English up to volume 11 or 12 out of 17 total volumes. 

The first season covers 1 and 2 and the second season covers 3 and 5. (They skipped volume 4) 




 They were ~$750 USD at the time those posts went up in Japan. 




 Would it account for all 300,000 sales? No, but evidence from past shows such as *K-ON!* where [people were going out and buying the $700 USD equivalent headphones that the characters used to the point that they sold out in the stores that sell them](http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=84543) lends some credence to that possibility.

The link goes to a forum post, but they gave and linked their sources enough that it is reputable. 




 Odds are, this is what increased sales of the game in Japan due to fans of the show going out and buying the game that the character is playing. 




 Heck, they even had the day theme from the game playing during the episode! 




 Most fansub groups have an IRC channel with a number of XDCC bots for people to use. So yeah, they are still around. 




 This is just /a/ pulling crap. I've read the manga up to the point that has been translated and none of this happens. 

Heck, other than the second point, those cannot happen as it is a "shounen" manga which is geared towards boys 12-19-ish...

 The one thing I really like about the recent posts by /u/Shadoxfix's bot, which uses his account, is that he includes the link to where you can legally watch it. 

I think there was something wrong with the bot so I copied the source from the episode 2 post, added the link to the second episode discussion and submitted it. 




 It is on Funimation. (You need their subscription to see the third episode but you can watch the first and second ones for free) 

There are *other* methods out there, but you are on your own.

 Better yet, when/if the kickstarter meets or exceeds its goal in November, the game will be released in English! (Sekai Project is even trying to get it on Steam but that one would be the all ages version. No idea how it is going to be all-ages without some of the scenes, but Frontwing [the developer] has a Vita version out which is all-ages.)

[Here is some more information about the Kickstarter right from Sekai Project.](http://prefundia.com/projects/view/lets-bring-the-grisaia-trilogy-to-the-west/2814/)
 




 It was complicated when it happened, but I would ask for you to search "truecrypt unsafe" for yourself to get an idea of what happened. 




 **WARNING:** TrueCrypt is not safe! There has been a lot of discussion over the months that hints that the developers of TrueCrpyt were coerced by government(s) into lessening the security of the software.  




 My university's anime club is crap. A lot of issues and drama that shouldn't be there is there so I don't bother going. 

I have found a number of people who watch anime and such that are pretty cool to hang out with so I do that.

My parents know about anime and such, but I have no idea what they think of it. They also know I have a few figures, but those were ones that I got while in Japan. My Mom likes the figures and thinks they are cool, but I have no idea what my father thinks. (I have a [Saber](http://myfigurecollection.net/item/111864), [Nadeko](http://myfigurecollection.net/item/175534) and a [Saber Lily nendoroid.](http://myfigurecollection.net/item/6581))

 Something something doujinshi. 




 Something something /r/tsunderesharks 




 [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/seriesfaq-fate) is /r/anime's FAQ/"How to get into the Fate series" wiki page. I think it is fairly clear but it depends on how far down the rabbit hole you want to go.

The Fate series is part of a larger universe which is colloquially known as the "Nasuverse". From a rough estimate, there is about ~15-20 full days worth of content. (360-480 hours!!!) 




 [Here](http://js-fireworks.appspot.com/svg/index.html) is where they got the code that they had scrolling in the background. It is a webGL experiment to launch fireworks and show a message on the screen.

 It happens quite often in anime where a female voice actress will voice a male, but seemingly female, character. (Hayate from *Hayate no Gotoku* comes to mind.) 




 This is the first time that I have ever heard Hebrew used in an anime.

Elohim means "God" and is used in the Bible to refer to God.

I can't find much about "Essaim" though... 




 Sensei and Ninomiya-kun from Minami-ke.  




 Yeah, I was doing mTurk before I even had a job. The surveys are, mainly, just giving your opinion and the tasks, if they are made right, give you more than enough instructions to do it. 

I'd suggest going to mTurk Forum (A third party forum) and using their daily recommended hits thread to find some of the better ones.

 Then why does the ibuprofen bottle that I have list it as a fever reducer? http://i.imgur.com/XJmB0T9.jpg 




 Try using mTurk. (US Only) Unlike many of the other beermoney sites, this one always has work for people to do. It is run by Amazon, but they do not (at least that I have seen) post work themselves. People, mainly researchers, post tasks/surveys/jobs/things for people to do in return for money. I've made ~$900 over three years off and on doing odd jobs. 




 Here we go again... 

Even when she visited the university that I went to last year there were really high contentions. She had to have bodyguards and such. One thing, that I do not like about her is that she had someone pre-screen all of the questions from students even thought it was written in the contract that the Q A would be open. (Heck, she didn't even want a Q A session.) 

She talks about being a journalist but yet she does not follow the conventions of not censoring (ie. Pre-screening) speech...


As for the "feminist" side she wasn't the stereotypical nutty feminist that people make her out to be. Yeah, she tends to pick the major and blatant examples that fits her arguments but she presents them in a logical manner. 




 If anyone is wondering what it is, I guess it is the max character size in smiley faces. (2048)
 




 Not only is it a Steinway it is, most likely, a model D (9-ft grand piano used, mainly, in concert halls and it costs about $150,000 USD). They even got the internals from the main brass "Chassis" to the shape/color of the hammers to even the piano stool that they use. I think they even used a Steinway when producing the music as it sounds the same as the Steinways that I have heard.

Source: I see and hear a model D every single day and it always has its lid up, during the day. (All Steinway School) Sadly the thing is normally playing itself... :(

 I hope they fall into usual patterns...

 .

 Otherwise they'd be stepping on each other's feet while dancing. 




 Don't be surprised to see Nozaki's counts go down. According to an earlier post the first volume of the anime included an event ticket which really jumps up the sales. 

Even so, I hope this means that they will make a second (or even a third) season. 




 Yeah, all of the Viz Media ones had to be removed by the developer. (There is a way around the block but involves installing a VPN and having your location set somewhere other than the US. Ironically, Japan works.) 




 Manga Rock is the one I use. It has access to a lot of different sites including batoto. (You can even search multiple sources at once!) 




 It is stated in the book that one alsin is about one meter. 

The other measurement that is unique to this series is the "koku" which is two hours. (ie. Half-koku is an hour) 




 "Friend maker" 




 While I am not a violinist, I think they even got the violin down with the correct finger placements and movement. (According to the PVs that are out.) 

I guess we'll have to wait until episode 2 to see the violin though. 




 While they aren't all Nintendo characters, there are figure shops in Japan. (Mainly around Akihabara and Nakano Broadway, but I image that there would be more around the country.) 




 While I am a mod here, I am talking as myself.

My thoughts are that you ought to make this as a "Request" thread but put the same rules and such in that post. 

My concern is that if we have this weekly, people will begin suggesting the same shows over and over until they get popular enough to break the qualifications. 

You may want to message the mods with the suggestion for a routine stickied post much like our current weekly suggestion threads. (I'd do it myself, but you are the one who has the idea and may be able to word it better than someone interpreting your post.) 




 No problem! I saw your question about it towards the mods and I double checked the rules and saw that was there. (I guess this way people can say "Hey, I like A:TLAB, what would be a good anime to watch?" and vice-versa.) 




 [Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5781/Isekai_no_Seikishi_Monogatari) - Pretty much fits your request to the letter. It is a spin-off of Tenchi Muyo but you don't have to know anything about that series to watch this one. 




 For some clarification, your recommendation of "The Legend of Korra" is allowed here since "Anime-inspired shows/films" is listed under accepted media. 




 Your link was automatically removed by AutoModerator.

Please change your link from an illegal manga site to something like MAL or Hummingbird where you can read the plot summary. 




 I am *shocked* that no one has mentioned the instruments in this episode!

They did an AMAZING job showing the instruments and the action of the keys, hammers and what not.

The Steinway   Sons piano is accurate down to the number of holes in the support, the model of the piano bench and everything else. (Source: I attend an all-Steinway university so I have seen them up close and even played them a bit. I am no where proficient with the piano but I have taken a little bit of lessons before.)

The keys that were played, throughout the episode, were accurate which really showed during the melodica scene during the trill around 17:07 is where I really noticed it. 




 Good enough that Guillermo del Toro is trying to get HBO to adapt it into a full series. (HBO is the same channel that is airing Game of Thrones) 

Source: http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2014/08/14/guillermo-del-toro-mentions-monster-adaptation-in-sugoi-japan-endorsement 




 Yeah, people got so many cards that they were able to guess the numbers even though they hadn't won them which is why your wins were empty. 




 Nope, the first episode was delayed until this week's monday. It will then return to its normal airing time. (Every Thursday) 




 Whoops, I meant to say for them to search for episode 1... 




 So far, there aren't any official sources for watching this show. To answer your question would be to break the rules. Try google searching for episode one since it is "out" and subbed somewhere.

Hint: Watch for /u/Shadowfix 's bot to post the discussion thread for it. It also looks the sites that people put fansubs on. 




 I wish they hadn't revealed that the red-haired girl was someone working with "Shepherd" in episode 1. I haven't read the source, as it isn't translated, but it seemed to be giving the viewer too much right off the bat. 

I guess, now the question isn't of who but why and how they are doing what they are doing.

I'll stick with this one as it seems as though it is a light-hearted series. Also, the VN is made by August who made "Brighter than the Dawning Blue" and "Fortune Arterial". (They've made others, but those two have been adapted into anime.) 




 There is "Osu!" which is a free music/rhythm game that can be played with only the mouse. There are thousands of charts/maps that are out there for you to play and there is even multiplayer. 




 That is why I said most of their shows are. Nichijou was only licensed in Australia. 




 Just because it isn't being simulcasted doesn't mean that it won't make it to the US. Odds are someone will license it considering most of KyoAni's works have been. (Except for Nichijou) 




 The CG is better in S2. 




 I think they did it like that because the MC is in the same situation. You learn of the world and what is going on as the MC does. 




 It got delayed due to a volleyball game going longer than anticipated. It was pushed to Monday. The second episode will air on Thursday at its normal time. 




 Heads up, no official source. Head to the high seas.

M Ms then only gave credit towards your cable bill... :( 




 Well, it is always the right moon if you *type* it out. 




 I wouldn't be surprised if that is where they got their inspiration from. 




 Welcome to the western world. They don't allow adult (AKA AO rated) content on Steam. This also goes for brick and mortar stores such as Wal Mart, Target, Best Buy, etc... 




 It may still have NSFW, but not the H, scenes in it. Sekai contacted Steam and they have worked out a way to possibly have those scenes. 




 I would suggest waiting until the game comes out on Steam. Yes, the VN (the all ages version) will be coming out on Steam in English. (Sekai Project has the rights to release it) 




 Even so, it is unmarked. 




 **WARNING:** The "Here is the original for the Amane bedroom scene is **NSFW!!!***

 There isn't anything inside the windows. It is just a gradient from the bottom right to the upper part of the middle. 




 Thing is, the writing quality of the translation is pretty good. It is a lot better than you think it is. (At least up through volume 5, which is where I am at.) There is a lot of intrigue and characterization that occurs and it is pretty good all things considered. 




 I would suggest reading the light novels. You can find them on the usual site. (It says "preview" but it is the full book.) 

The LNs are a lot better than what the anime is making it out to be. While the fan service scenes are there they are fairly short and only really happen once or twice a volume. (224 pages or so.) They are also brought up again later so they serve an actual purpose. 




 It definitely has a big budget. The big (ie. Little) things I noticed:

* Finger positions and movement while playing the violin
* The action of the piano
* The "Steinway   Sons" licensing, which I imagine would not be cheap
* Animation quality
* Sound/OST quality was really really good even though it was hosted on YouTube...
 




 Heck, Madoka was only 1 cour and you see how well that was written/done. 




 [Gate: Thus the JSDF Fought There](http://myanimelist.net/manga/41733/Gate:_Jieitai_Kanochi_nite_Kaku_Tatakeri) which applies a similar idea as Outbreak Company but with the JSDF (Japanese Self Defense Force), which is basically Japan's military. 

**WARNING**: Some of the scenes are gruesome and may contain full frontal nudity. It is still a great read and it is released monthly. 




 Even better is that you can easily buy the soundtrack through iTunes. 




 Shouldn't it be:

Counteraction:  
[X] Rising    
[ ] Falling   




 Thank you for reminding people to use the correct flair. I've changed it for OP. 




 It isn't that we are getting lazy, it is moreso the fact that college has started back up and we are busy. 

Automoderator takes care of a lot of the things that had to be done by hand and most of the day to day things.

I've changed the flair for the thread to "Request". 
























 Better yet, according to a tweet from the animation studio, that was a single unrehearsed take. 




 Sorry that it took me so long to respond.

Here are the three figures that I have:

* [Sengoku Nadeko](https://i.imgur.com/fOzb9qi.jpg) from Monogataru Second Season (This is the one I won from the crane game)

* [Saber](https://i.imgur.com/axrrMeF.jpg?1) from Fate/Stay Night

* [Saber Lilly Nendoroid](http://i.imgur.com/jSKdPsz.jpg) (Nendoroids are basically a small figure with an accented head size. They are also modular.) 




 I, personally, have no idea. I know what if you want the $4.99 pricing you have to sign up on their education page, but I do not know if it works with this three month deal. The best bet would be to contact Spotify and ask. 




 Dang it, the suspense is killing me! 




 I feel the same way about this. I, basically, do not talk about anime/manga at all unless someone else references or brings it up in a conversation. If they do and it is in a public situation where others can hear, I act as though I know nothing.

I had the opportunity to go to Japan this year as part of a class trip and I did pick up a few things while I was there. I was extremely hesitant to buy any sort of figure but I won one from a crane game at a Taito Game Station. 

My Mom thinks they are cool and I have no idea what my Dad thinks of them... :/ 




 Nope. I worded it wrong. When I said "this deal" I was thinking of the linked one. I guess you could try and do the $0.99 for three months, cancel and try for the student pricing but YMMV. 




 If you are a college student in the US and have access to a .edu email address you can get Spotify Premium for $4.99 a month. 

This deal gives you premium at $0.99 a month for three months then $9.99 from there on out. 




 People will say it belongs on /r/aww rather than here. 




 Sail the high seas. 




 Is it really yuri? We, the viewer, know that TailRed is a guy but Dark Grasper doesn't... 




 With After Story keep on watching the rest of the episodes. 




 This should be interesting... 

Also, as a heads up one of the later pages is NSFW. 




 As a heads up, Reddit doesn't like self-promotion. The general rule of thumb is that your self-promotional posts to a subreddit should be less than 10% of the contributions to the same subreddit. 

I've seen people banned for not doing as such. 




 Someone ought to recreate Spice and Wolf as one of those children's books along the line of "If You Give a Mouse a Cookie..." but as "If You Give a Wolf an Apple..." 




 I think there are some people over on /r/anime that are doing a Haruhi Suzumiya rewatch. 




 The fan translated ones were taken down when the novels were licensed in English.

So far, in the official releases, I haven't come across any weird grammatical errors but there is going to be a debate on whether it is Horo or Holo for her name. 




 You ought to read the books. Season 1 covers volumes 1 and 2. Season 2 covers volumes 3 and 5.

There are 12 volumes out right now in English. 




 I know this is digressing, but oh well. Black Rock Shooter is, originally, a Hatsune Miku song by Supercell. I do not remember the name/username of the person, but someone made a music video having the character, which is heavily influenced by the character design of Hatsune Miku, go through the story in the lyrics through the video. That music video and story got really popular which prompted a novel, manga, OVA, anime, merchandise, etc into what you know today.


Sorry about that, I used to be into vocaloid stuff a few years ago and I remember when this was all happening. I haven't, other than knowing f and f2 are out and Mirai on the 3DS soon, been following the scene for awhile.  




 For the past few weeks, I have been reading a number of light novels, but I am trying to find ones that are mainly romance/comedy oriented.

The only real requirement that I have is for the novels to:

1. Not have ecchi
2. An MC that isn't a blatant self-insert. (What I mean by that is a setting where the MC goes from some recluse to having a harem overnight because he is nice to them. These are, mainly, the fantasies of the author and as such they do not have a lot of depth)
3. Not a lot of vocabulary that is unique to the story. I get it that they have to describe certain mechanics, but there are better ways to ago about world building without is being a bunch of random terms together.

Some examples of what I am looking for:

* Hikaru ga Chikyuu ni Itakoro......
* Toradora
* Hyouka

While it may seem that I am only asking for realistic romance stories, that isn't the case but they are the ones that I can think of off the top of my head. (Heck, Index could work here.) 




 Try loading the map in Hammer. There isn't a ledge to stand on as it is boxed off all the way up to the sky. 




 I hope they will animate that. 




 Some people are working on a translation patch for the game right now. They have up through what the trial version of the game offers and you can get the patch here: http://libraryshepherd.tumblr.com/post/103642341617/remember-when-i-said-ill-update-weekly

I hope it doesn't turn out like all of the other August VN TL efforts where the group drops/stops working on it or even worse, goes dark. This happened for Yoake Mae, Fortune Arterial and Aiyoku no Eustia so far... :( 




 It is fun, once you get the radio working, to just load up and tool around in every so often. It isn't demanding and it is a nice change of pace compared to most games out there.

 I don't feel like reposting my comments again, but I had a conversation about this back on the article (also on /r/games) where I discussed the potential impact of the game being in the anime. 

[Here is the comment chain.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2jvx0z/terraria_console_sales_top_300000_in_japan/clfmq6l?context=3) 




 Well, there is Saber Lily but that is a "different" Saber. 




 This reads like an ad for some guys book which people will get for free which will then push said book higher up the charts which results in people buying it when it goes back to its original price.

Heck, OP copy and pasted the same chunk of the text twice. 




 You need to include a link to the site and other information. 




 Anything is better than nothing. Also, I believe that YouTube only contacts those who meet certain qualifications for monetization. 

No one know how much they are going to make for sure since the CPM differs on the demographics that the videos bring in as advertisers are going to target their demographic.

I can say, however, that if you are going to do it be aware that, unless you join a network, you will only get paid when you reach $100 in your pending amount on AdSense. (This is public information and it is not a statement of how much I, personally, have made through YouTube.) 




 Who wouldn't? People who do not want to be charged with a felony for it is considered fraud.

 [Here](https://vndb.org/r?q= fil=lang-en.plat-psp) is a list of VN's that are available on the PSP.

There is a blog that compiles VNs that can run through homebrew on the PSP.

EDIT: Removed link due to the site giving you download links for the games. Just search "visual novels on PSP" and you should find it. 




 Nope, it is part of the contract. Even if it wasn't it is poor form to ask someone for their salary. 




 Depenidng on how the adblock works, it will do one of two things:

* Block the ads from loading = No impression

* Load but hide the ads (This is how it works on Chrome) = Same as loading but not clicking the ad. (I'm not sure about how video ads work when blocked) 




 It is a combination of the video ads, the ads on the side and the ones that pop up during the video on the bottom. Someone who is monetized can set which of these ads are shown or all of them.

It is and isn't on views. You are insunating that it is determined by someone watching the video, but even going on the page and having it up will cause an "impression". (aka ad view)

Google has been in the advertising business for years so it is near impossible to exploit and if you do your account will be frozen and you will no longer be monetized. (Youtube uses Google's AdSense platform for ads)
 




 Huh, that must be new as I remember reading a few interviews of large youtubers and they claimed that they were unable to disclose how much they earn.  




 No one who makes money from YouTube is allowed to disclose their earnings. My, personal, channel is monetized and that is something that YT drills into you when you join. 




 For those of you who have also played/watched Little Busters, imagine Rin saying those lines. (Same VA) 




 I found Yuuki: --- , 




 Recently, I have been running out of good romance/comedy anime to watch so I'm turning to visual novels.

I played the demo/trial for NekoPara today and it is basically what I am looking for but the cat ears are not necessary. I've been playing a bit of Hoshizora no Memoria and I have heard that it is a moege, butI haven't gotten that far into it.
 




 Gate 7, which is CLAMP's newest work due to the terminology and required knowledge of Japanese mythology.

I liked Tsubasa up until *that* point but I am not too sure about this new one. 




 You'll have to search around online. A good place to start would be the VNDB listing which should have a link to the patch for the game.

You'll need a copy of the game that you ripped or from sites that cannot be linked. 




 Nope, the site is safe. Most people put a warning on TVTropes links because if you aren't careful you could lose a lot of time thumbing through various pages of tropes and series. 




 What is even better is the description:

 Charles Barkley was a child prodigy at basketball. Anybody with him on their team would automatically win. He was just that good. After his mother, who was also his coach, died, he had a mental breakdown and refused to join a team ever again.
 
 Two years later, Barkley still hasn't come to terms with his mother's loss. Every time he tries to make a shot, he can no longer see where the basket is. He's resigned himself from ever playing basketball again, and enjoys his life spending time with Russell Wilson and Peyton Manning, as they enjoy their favorite sports.
 
 That is, until Michael Jordan comes along. Jordan's a free-spirited basketball player, and he sparks Barkley into trying to learn how to play again. He teaches him that basketball isn't just about making the shot: it's about enjoying the thrill of the game.

 It depends. 




 It is a site called Mechanical Turk which is owned and operated by Amazon. They allow requesters, who are mainly either researchers or companies, who need people to tasks that computers cannot do such as surveys or even classifying images and such.   You have to be a US Citizen and have a SSN which you will have to provide Amazon for the I-9 form for taxes. If you make more than $600 a year Amazon has to send you the form to fill out for income tax purposes. 

There is always work to do and there are opportunities for higher pay once you do a number of hits. (Typically 1000 and 5000) The minimum rate you want to shoot for is $0.10 a minute. ($6 an hour) but it pays a lot better than swagbucks and what not. 




 My guess it is because shows that normally don't have much of a plot like this one have stepped things into high gear this week. 




 Lagoon sends any computer into a frenzy.  




 If you are in the US you ought to sign up for Mturk. It is run by Amazon and it is the only site where I have been able to make any sort of substantial income on the side. (I've made ~$900+ over about two years of off and on work on the site. With going to college, I'll end up stopping for 3-4 months at a time or more too.) 




 Good luck trying to avoid the alt-fire of the triple threat. It can go pretty far.

 Technically, "Saber is my blood" works better as mana is found in blood and it is by Shirou's mana, thereby his blood, that Saber is able to exist. 




 As a heads up, you have to get your tickets well in advance as there is normally a three or more month wait list. Why is there such a long wait list for it? They only admit 200 people per day.

Also, it is really hard to get tickets outside of Japan since you have to get them at a Lawson (A chain of convenience stores in Japan) or through a [designated travel agency.](http://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/ticket-information/) (The link is to the Ghibli Museum's page about how to get tickets outside of Japan) 




 Old comment, but there are the ones in the same "universe":

* [Please Teacher](http://myanimelist.net/anime/195/Onegai%E2%98%86Teacher) - A certain character looks a lot like Remon.

 If you are in college and have an edu email and access to your class schedule you can bring down the price of Premium to $5 a month if you are in the US. 




 It is kind of hidden too. There is the shop outside, but unbeknownst to a number of people the actual Tokyo Anime Center is inside. 

When I went in May they had stuff for Mahouka and Black Bullet. 




 Took less than 24 hours! 




 Oh okay, when I was in Japan for two weeks I went into a manga cafe and saw that they had volume 32. I didn't have enough time to look for more volumes as the group I was with was being too loud and we got shoo'ed out but that is another story. 




 It is by the same mangaka as Pastel, which is a similar but much longer series. (Some say it drags on, but I think that is in part to the lack of people translating it. I know, for a fact since I saw it myself, that the series is at least up to volume 32 in Japan but the translations are around volume 28.) 




 Well, they have announced that they are going to put up a kickstarter to license three of the Grisaia games which were made by Frontwing. (The first one has already been translated and it is regarded as one of the best translations yet.) They are going to edit and fix up the first game and then, if they get enough as they are stretch goals, translate the next two games and they might even license the Magical Girl Chiruchiru spin off. 




 It is already around 107k, it will be funded. 




 **WARNING: The scene above has MASSIVE spoilers.** 




 My thought on the stretch goals is that they could try and get the PS3 art assets.

Other than that, I'd love for Sekai to put that money towards another of Key's VNs such as Little Busters, Rewrite or even Angel Beats. 




 What about the PS3 assets?
 




 My guess would be that they would try and get the PS3's art assets which were greatly improved over the original artwork along with being a higher resolution. 

**NOTE:** I am ***NOT*** affiliated with Sekai Project or Key/Visual Arts. 




 Same thing is hitting Iris Zero... :'( 




 I watched the wheat field scene on YouTube and it threw me into a spiral of depression for a few months. It has that sort of impact. 




 I wasn't able to get it today as when I go to my usual dining location on campus, there weren't that many people around so they weren't saving tables. I should be able to do it tomorrow. 




 The anime, which is based upon the visual novel, is extremely popular in both the Japanese and Western communities. While I haven't played the visual novel, the anime is one of the few that have made me cry and the only one that has made any serious impact upon my life. (You may think I am crazy, but Clannad made me look at family and what it all entails in a new way.)

The visual novel is also known for its extreme length. I remember reading, according to a walkthrough, that even knowing where the branch points are and where to save, to read all of the routes takes anywhere from 90-120 hours. Otherwise it is closer to 200-300 hours of reading.

The VN and anime is renowned for its soundtrack and the usage of these tracks to emphasize certain scenes. If you want to listen to it, the OST is on iTunes in most countries.

**EDIT:** To give you an idea, the amount of hype around this coming to the English markets in the visual novel fanbase is along the lines of Valve announcing Half-Life 3. People thought it would never happen and yet, here it is. 




 If the HPA4 has USB input you don't need the optical input as the PS4 can do it without it. 




 They leave their phones and even wallets to save their table/seat. If you want, I can even get a picture tomorrow to prove it. 




 Nah, he has you beet^^^^hoven. 




 There is. All you have to do is call the intern and tell him to write the script. 




 I didn't use proxies, but my account was under review last December. It took about a week or two for the investigation to be over and they didn't find anything and turned the account back over to me.

So, yes, people have had their account under review and not been banned before. 




 It isn't that different than the historical building designation in the US and I imagine other countries have something similar. 




 They are in Japan. 




 I go to college in the US and it is like that where people leave their stuff on tables and just walk away to go get food. I think it is due to the school being entirely fenced in and all of the entrances/exits are manned. They check for a student ID when people try and enter. 




 Oh, my thought is that she purposefully didn't show up so that he had the opportunity to perform for people without the stress of a competition looming over him. 




 Try /r/learnjapanese 




 Doki wasn't the original translation group. They were working through Clannad and, supposedly, retranslating it before Sekai picked it up. Sekai, initially, announced a partnership with Doki but since then Sekai has announced that they are going to hire a professional translator to do the game. (People are wondering if they are going to hire Doki's translator or not) 




 There is the possibility that it will be fan translated. 




 "Bugger off" and "wanker" could be considered to be inappropriate. I have no idea where you are from, but Reddit is a culmination of different cultures and ideas and some idea which are appropriate one place may not be elsewhere. 




 Sure, lets have people by a speaker that has seven microphones that are always listening and can even pick up what you say over other noises! 

This isn't an invasion of privacy or anything! ^^^^Suckers... 




 His books are available online for free from his website. I remember reading that if you like his books to buy a copy and donate it to a school or public library. 




 That sort of language is inappropriate for the subreddit. Consider this to be your warning. 




 [Outbreak Company](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19369/Outbreak_Company)

[Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5781/Isekai_no_Seikishi_Monogatari) - One of my favorites, but note that each episode is double length. (~45 minutes per episode) 




 You can click "Change Layout" on the right which allows you to browse the images differently. (I picked the middle one as I didn't have to see a lot of images at once and I could just click next to go through them) 




 The way things looks, it reminds me of Yodabashi Camera in Akihabara which (at least for the one I know about) is a HUGE electronics and hobby store that even has its own food court. 




 If you want the OST right now it is $15.99 on the US iTunes store. [Here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/clannad-original-soundtrack/id823583025) is a link that will launch iTunes and bring up the album for you to look at. 




 There will also be a physical version if it reaches the $140,000 stretch goal. 




 The entire OP is pretty good and it is EIGHT minutes long. The song is spread into parts that talk about the chapters in the manga that the season covers. 




 If you ever go to Engladn, never call it a fanny pack. Fanny means something else over there and it is not appropriate... 




 To me in 2009: "Invest in Bitcoin and wait for it to hit $1000 a coin before cashing out." 




 They are localized, if you want it on the PC.

 If you want brawling at a supermarket go watch "Ben-To". 




 It could be one of the two OVAs that were recently announced for all we know. 




 It also seems as though the student council president has an inkling that Souji is TailRed, but dismissed the thought. Odds are it will be brought up next episode with her joining the team as TailYellow. 




 A pair of good headphones. I used to use Bose, then I switched to the Audio Technica ATH-M50's then after a few years I got the Sennheiser HD650 and I can never go back to my old headphones.  




 Probably people who create a new account to spam their sites in order to garner views. 

Last time it happened, the admins quickly shadowbanned them.  




 Reddit has helped me earn ~$1200 over three or so years.

It was mainly through /r/beermoney introducing me to Amazon's Mechanical Turk. It has allowed me to earn some money in my spare time which has allowed me to buy things without paying anything out of pocket. 




 Pretty much any parody anime comes to mind.

* Seitokai no Ichizon
* Hayate no Gotoku
* Lucky Star
 




 No need for the "Life Note". In the original one-shot for Death Note, if you erased the name before the body was destroyed they would come back to life. 




 Then erase the names so they get back to work.  




 You may want to provide a list of sorts such that people don't recommend things you have already seen. 




 Heck, there were Pulp Fiction characters in the fourth episode of KLK. 




 The anime, which uses the same pencil-esque artstyle of the game, is really good. [Here](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5507/Senjou_no_Valkyria:_Gallian_Chronicles) is the myanimelist listing about it. 




 * Sakurasou - Eh...
* Toradora - Not until later in the season
* Kokoro Connect - This fits.
* Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun - She is. He has no idea.
* Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou - Doesn't fit what OP is looking for
* Kaichou wa Maid-sama - The lead MC is too tsundere and doesn't fit what OP is looking for.  




 Try [White Album 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18245/White_Album_2)! Do not watch White Album for it is a different series and it is really bad. WA2 is an excellent romance anime that definitely goes places. 




 This content is not suited for /r/animesuggest or Reddit in general. Please see the [sitewide rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules) about self-promotion. 
























 I'm not going to be *that guy* and repeat it.

Basically, /u/IHaveAGloriousBeard, is wishing that it was easier to get housing in the game for the ability to have a space to be creative is what intrigues him about MMOs.

My guess is that they wish housing was cheaper than it is, or didin't require an obscene amount of time to get to the point that you can own housing in the game. 




 Out of context, it seems as though he isn't miserly but the fact is that he [around chapter 80-ish spoilers](/s "was given one million yen to get out of the mansion and get through the day because he saw Nagi changing.")

Given the money and the chance to, he would help those in need like he did. He still has the debt of 150 million yen. (~1.5 million dollars) 




 Nope. If you try the trial, you would still have to buy the game. (Which includes a 1 month subscription) 




 I used to think $15 a month was a lot but when you think about it, $15 is the same as going out to eat lunch once a month or three trips to Starbucks for a lot of hours of entertainment. 




 I don't see why not, it is the same as if I were to buy the collector's edition right now. Those 30 days are part of the cost of the game and it is no different than buying a month subscription.

So to get more out of it, try the trial and get up to 20 in as many classes as possible (or that you want) and then add the 1 month subscription. 




 Amagi Brilliant Park 




 I am not guaranteeing anything, but I saw that back when 2.3 dropped they had a free login weekend where anyone who had purchased the game in the past could play for free so they might have it for 2.5. 

PS: I am not affiliated with Square Enix so this is just speculation. 




 Seems as such, but you would have to make a new Square Enix account according to the restrictions here: http://support.na.square-enix.com/faqarticle.php?id=5382 la=1 kid=70929 ret=main (Also, you wouldn't have your progress from when you had the subscription since you are on a new account.)

One cool thing about FFXIV, that I have gleaned from the trial, is that one character can be all of the classes and they level/spec differently. (Even better is that you can share some abilities with other classes such as being an archer but using the archanist's physick for healing) 




 Yeah, all of those characters are from [August's visual novels.](https://vndb.org/p95)  




 Yep, you are right. They always thought that she was a guy because she never talked. 

I would imagine that the fantasia potion would allow what it allows now though. 




 If you have the game, try the free trial which allows you to play up to level 20 on each class and get a feel for it.

NOTE: If you have the retail copy DO NOT get the free trial through Steam for you would have to buy it through Steam to continue. 




 Something like fantasia would work for in the first episode of the first season one of the characters, Akatsuki, ~~is brought in as a male ninja but she is female~~ through the use of a potion similar to fantasia, she was able to change her appearance to her actual ~~gender and~~ stature.

Also, it is a really good show for MMO players as they use different mechanics such as the idea of cooldowns and effects and what not.  




 They could be on a mobile device. 




 Actually, like /u/EnduranceProtocol said, you can flair on mobile. You have to put []\(#request) in the beginning of the body of your post.

I have flaired it accordingly for you. 




 The app has always been free... 




 Sometimes I love reddit and the fact the people can have the exact same thought when faced with an image like this. 




 /r/anime has a really good wiki page about where to start with the Fate/___ Series. You can find the link [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/seriesfaq-fate#wiki_where_should_i_start.3F) 




 Personally, that would be even more confusing to people. While I get your point, it would be too "wordy" to fit as a flair and it would be a pain in the rear for mobile users to type it out. 




 Probably about $600-700 through various sites like the usual mTurk and PerkTV along with that M Ms promotion where I made about $150 from it. 




 No problem! I didn't mean to sound as harsh as I did. 




 [](#meta)

With the recent influx of posts with incorrect flair, I'd like to clarify the definitions of the various flair/tags.


##Which flair should I use?

Flair type | Description | Example 1 | Example 2
:--|:--|:--|:--
**Request** | Requesting anime based on information you provide | "Anime where the main character stops taking crap from the tsundere heroine and starts to dislike her?" | "I loved Mirai Nikki. Any suggestions?"
**Suggestion** | Suggesting anime to others | "Psycho-Pass is a 2012 show written by Urobochi Gen. It is a smart, dark sci-fi criminal story set in weird utopia/dystopia. The protagonist is a rookie cop on hunt for a serial killer." | "If you like Asimov, robotics, or Spielberg's A.I., watch Eve no Jikan"
**Manga/LN/VN** | Requests or suggestions specifically about manga, light novels, or visual novels | "Manga in which the characters go to the Moon and has some romance?" | "I enjoyed Katawa Shoujo, what other VNs would be good to play?"
**Identification **\* | Help identifying something (a gif, something from your memory, etc.) | "Help me ID an anime with man wrestling a deer." | "Anyone know what anime this GIF is from. It consists of a stylist who is working on a panda."
**Question** | General questions about a series| "In what order should I watch Ghost in the Shell?"| "Steins;Gate: English dubbed or subbed?"
**Meta** | Posts that discuss the subreddit itself| "Guide to tagging your post with flair"| "Just want to say it's nice to see the consistent suggestion posts and also want to welcome new frequent posters! Keep it up!"

\* When you submit an identification link, choose the `Identification ` flair. When someone answers your question, change it to `Identification ` so that users may know that your question has been solved.

---
To tag your post on mobile, you must have a special code **in the body of your post** when you submit.

Flair type | Code
:--|:--
[Request]|**[]\(#request)**
[Suggestion]|**[]\(#suggestion)**
[Manga/LN/VN]|**[]\(#manga)**
[Identification]|**[]\(#identification)**
[Question]|**[]\(#question)**
[Meta]|**[]\(#meta)** 




 You have the wrong flair. You are asking/***requesting*** show(s) for someone to watch.

I have changed it accordingly. Also **do not** put the flair in the title for it is redundant. 




 You had the wrong flair for you are asking/*requesting* shows, you need to use the "Request" flair.

I have changed it for you this time, but please remember to flair correctly in the future. 




 I'm really new to MMOs in general and I am trying the free trial. I see that if you don't buy the full version of the game within 90 days you lose your data.

If I do decide to upgrade, is there still a time limit for resubbing without losing your data/character(s)? (I'm asking because I am a college student and the semester starts soon. I might have more time over the summer to play which could warrant resubbing but I don't want to buy the game if there is still the possibility of losing my characters) 




 You could definitely make some money running those sites but you might want to look into selling the stories in example 1, linking to Amazon using an affiliate link in #2 and just having a good site in #3 to improve your income.

I, personally, make some money using adsense on my youtube channel but it isn't much. (That is also my fault for not growing/establishing an identity and not really editing my videos)

I cannot go into, minute, detail about my earnings but I have been paid twice.

You need to earn $100 in your adsense account before you cash out. You can set the type of ads that you want on each site individually. (I think... It has been awhile since I checked my account) 




 Thanks for doing this and your work throughout the season! 




 Most of the time when a show in announced at the end of a season, there is a one season gap between the announcement and when it airs. (ie. It was announced at the end of the Fall season so there is a high chance that it will air in the Spring) 




 I was shocked to see someone doing one of the characters from Payday. (The video game) 




 I have removed your post for there is a multitude of unmarked spoilers. 

Please read rule #3:

 Use spoiler codes (see below) and no spoilers in titles. If revealing spoilers is crucial to your post, do so in the body. We reserve the right to ban you if you do not follow this rule.
 




 In the future, you might want to make the post like you did but also, send a link to the moderators to the post so that we can definitely see it. 

I, personally, only check in on the subreddit once or twice a day and this would make it easier for the moderators to see and discuss the post.

I have gone ahead and done so there isn't a need to do so for this one.

---
I know I have double commented on the same post, but I didn't want to distinguish the other one since it was my own thoughts. 




 Personally, and this is just my opinion without asking any of other mods, I think that it should be under "Question" but I can see the need for this sort of flair. (This would have to be up to the mods as a collective to think of how to do it and, more importantly, how to add it to the CSS along with the mobile tagging system) 




 For some clarification, and this is how I think of it:

* **Request** is used when you are *asking* for a show.

* **Suggestion** is used when you are *giving* show(s) for people to watch. 




 Good luck, Reddit disapproves and could possibly shadowban you for continual self-promotion. 




 Something something /r/nocontext  




 You could always install a bidet in your toilet. Let it run for ~30-40 seconds and you should be good to go. 




 Unless you use a site that unshortens the link you have no idea where that link is going which creates a larger risk for malware and drive-by downloads.

There is also the fact that a lot of those link shortening sites are used to serve people ads and the person who posts the link gets a cut of the money. 




 It is going to be packed:

* F/SN UBW continuation

* Knights of Sidonia S2

* Yahari S2

* HS DxD S3 (If you are into that sort of thing)

* Shokugeki no Soma

* Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo

* Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu (Haruhi spin-off with the original voice cast)

* Nisekoi S2

* Hibike! Euphonium (KyoAni's new show. [Here is the PV for it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6B320TbJk))

* Hello! Kiniro Mosaic

* Gintama (S# whatever they are on now) 




 The new KyoAni show along with The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan. (The new Haruhi spin-off anime) 




 Someone needs to make the "It's raining men" part a full AMV. 




 You might want to provide a MyAnimeList or some other anime tracker profile/list so that people can get an idea of what you are looking for.

While it is a lot more light-hearted, you might want to try some anime in the "game" genre such as [Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15315/Mondaiji-tachi_ga_Isekai_kara_Kuru_Sou_Desu_yo) or [No Game No Life](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19815/No_Game_No_Life). 




 OP, you were requesting (asking for) shows not suggesting (giving) shows to watch.

I have changed your flair accordingly, but please try to select the appropriate one in the future. 




 Actually this shouldn't be "Suggestion" but "Request" for OP is asking for shows that are similar to ____. 




 Put that $50 towards your PC build. 




 [Osu!](http://osu.ppy.sh) is the first one that came to mind. The game is updated at least once a week with new features and bugfixes. What is really impressive is that the game is free, and there is only one guy working on it. 

It was first released on September 17, 2007 and the updates have been continual since then. 




 Now I'm sad... I wonder how it will go from here.

Some speculations and thoughts on how it might progress: 

* See how people react to her (Possibly the run in with her actual parents)

* Have the MC grow to love her

* Repercussions due to time travel

* Find a way to avoid the MC's death

* Any/all of the above 




 Thanks for doing this OP. 




 Sorry, all I did was reiterate what the [Steam page says.](https://i.imgur.com/30Cyqcm.png)

I've only ever played it on the PS3 when I got it through PS+. 




 Don't see why not. You might want to use some software to make the PS4 controller seem like a Xbox 360 one for minimal configuration. 




 You probably could. I was playing dolphin, the emulator, yesterday using my gamecube controller and the WiiU gamecube adapter and windows fews it as a normal controller. 




 I've heard good things about *Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons* and for $1.49 you can't go wrong. You WILL need a controller since the mechanic is that one analog stick is assigned to only one brother and the other one to the other brother.

Another recommendation that I have for people would be *Kerbal Space Program*. While it is in early access, the developers have been updating it for the past two years and the community has really grown by leaps and bounds so it would be worth it to get it now. 




 I got:

* Nikon D7100

* AF-S DX NIKKOR
18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR II Lens

* AF-S DX NIKKOR
55-300mm f/4.5-5.6G ED VR Lens

* A carrying case

* 32 and 64GB SD card for said camera.

I am really looking forward to learning about and using this camera. 




 Just don't invite Mr. Nook. 




 The series is "[Domestic na Kanojo](http://myanimelist.net/manga.php?id=70941)". The current translator said that he/she would do it up through the third volume of the series. There are 30+ chapters out in Japanese and in English we are up to 11. 




 If you want work, stick around /r/manga for groups are always looking for new translators. I know of a series that the subreddit is really liking that will be losing its translator soon so you might be able to step in.  




 It is too early to sleep but I had to go up anyways so that "santa" (ie. My parents) could set up for Christmas. It happens every year, so I am used to it. 




 Could the guy been of asian descent? I know in Japanese, America is written as  which is "a-me-ri-ka" since they do not have a "ca" syllable. That could explain the hard consonant at the end. 




 Heck, you could loop the first ten or so seconds and it would seem to be a normal ringtone. 




 I have removed your post for you are looking for hentai and other NSFW content. This is against rule #4 of this subreddit. I don't make the rules, just enforce them.

You might want to look at getting/playing Nekopara which is coming out on the 30th on Steam (as an all ages version) or the 18+ version which will be released elsewhere online.

 




 As a heads up, you will want to remember to flair your post with the appropriate flair. Since I am able to, I went ahead and did so.

You may also want to link to a MyAnimeList or some other anime tracker/list site with what you have seen and liked.

 If the letter was sent in the US, you ought to check the ink stamped over the, well, stamp. That will show you which post office the sender used to send the letter. 




 There is also the Uncharted series. 




 Yeah, but wouldn't it make more sense to release it as a free app with ads so that a lot more people would download it within that period of time? 




 I'd get it, but it seems as though the app has ads even though it is a paid application. To me that is really annoying and if the general idea is that if you pay, you don't have ads. 




 Something something "Don't do it."

Followed by a post about how that in of itself is turning into a meme.

With that followed by a post with a copy/paste of that story/paragraph/run-on sentence. 




 Something something "one of us".

Still, I welcome his reviews and insight into the media. 




 There is also Nekopara, which is coming out on the 30th, that is pretty much the definition of "Moe". 




 No problem! I went to read the introduction and I saw it. I figured it got past the spell check since it was spelled correctly but it was the wrong word. 




 One thing you might want to fix in your introduction is that you have "right" when you meant "write". 




 If it is part of a daily/flash deal during the main sales, it will not go lower. If it isn't low enough for you, wait until the spring or summer sales. 




 I've been interested in Guild Wars 2 as an MMO since there isn't a need for a subscription but it doesn't seem to be bogged down by a pay to win cash shop like the "free"-to-play MMO's that are out there.

Part of my renewed interest in the game is that it is, currently, on sale over at Amazon and I was given a gift card for there and I could download it. Another part is due to watching Log Horizon which is the story of seasoned MMO players getting stuck in the MMO and their adaption, and the viewer's subsequent introduction, to the world which looks and operates much like an MMO. (It is actually a pretty good watch too, but I digress.)

A few questions I have:

* How is it holding up? (I know it came out a few years ago)

* How friendly is it to a new player? (This not only be how the game is for new folk, but also the reaction of the community to someone who is new)

* How big/organized are the quests/raids?

* What do you think of it?
 




 If you want to see how someone made it into an actual sword replete with a live blade, [Man at Arms did a video about it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obw19lRWO-Y) 




 Man, I hope the person who is doing Daitoshokan is able to keep up the pace. (They are translating ~3% every week! By extrapolation, the TL could be done around the middle of June.) 




 At least the other passengers could watch the movie, *Gone With the Wind*. 




 No problem!

It opens with the girls in a sauna replete with nudity and such. 




 WARNING: The first half of the chapter is NSFW! 




 I think the original *To Love-Ru* ran in Shounen Jump, so I imagine they can. 




 For those of you who are confused, here is the TV Tropes link with a description and examples of "tsundere".

 What sucks is that there are maps that, basically, require the player to have a drawing pad/tablet to complete. (You are talking 1000+ pixel "jumps", which is the space between single notes. That is next to impossible to do with a mouse.)

As someone who plays with a mouse it is really annoying to have that type of map on an otherwise good song. 




 I'm not the person you responded to, but to find out:

1. Ask how early/late you were

2. Go back 9 months.

3. Apply how late/early you were

4. Now you know. 




 For those trying to find the link since it wasn't a featured article, here you go: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Today%27s_featured_list/December_2014

Scroll down to December 19th. 




 How about submitting from a mobile device? If you are in an app or something like that you don't see it. 




 You'll have to find that on your own as you would, most likely, be downloading it illegally. 




 I've heard that it doesn't hold any punches in its content. 




 You might also want to read the mangaka's new work *Domestic na Kanojo* which is being translated at a pretty quick rate for the time being. 




 I can attest that restrictions on creativity can help spur it. I'm the type of person that can be creative but within a box (restrictions/ideas). Without it, I am useless. 




 Status update:

I was unable to save the Kerbal as the craft had mysteriously vanished. I have, however, managed to [land on the Mun twice](https://i.imgur.com/q9KGMWk.jpg) and [launch a working satellite.](https://i.imgur.com/lD70NLS.jpg)This is the beginning of the end of my free time. 




 You might also want to wait/try Nekopara. I've read the demo/trial and it seems to be a fun and light-hearted story. The main game comes out on December 30th. 




 Good grief. 




 Sorry, they went out of business a few years ago. 




 You can't when another program minimizes the screen for you without any warning or consent. 




 I was time warping to get a maneuver and I had the speed up pretty high (~1000x since I had a day-ish to skip) and all of a sudden ASUS WebStorage decides to tell me that I need to update by minimizing any fullscreen windows.

I was really annoyed as it took me awhile to find a maneuver that did what I needed on that mission and I didn't have an autosave that was recent.

I really wish there was a way to have the game pause when it is minimized. 




 My main issue with your comment is that you replied rejecting the recommendation that someone gave you. That, in of itself, is against the spirit and idea of this subreddit. There are many on here that would be more than willing to suggest things to people, but if the requester is going to reply back saying something along the lines of "This suggestion sucks" what do you think the suggester would think? It doesn't stop with that requester, what if there was a user who was visiting this subreddit for the first time, or wanted some interesting romance anime, saw this reply at the top?

"If you have nothing good to say, don't say anything." (ie. If you don't like a recommendation you are not obligated to reply.) 




 Like I said, screenshots won't do this series justice but if you want to be hard-headed so be it, but do not ridicule someone for their suggestion.

This sort of thing could undermine the purpose of this subreddit.

/u/FoleyX90, don't be discouraged from suggesting anime.

 




 For clarification purposes:

* The "x" is for unsolved identification posts
* The "check" is for solved identification posts. 




 I don't think Yuushibu would be a good thing for a 10-year old, let alone a girl. 




 Remember the phrase "Never judge a book by its cover."? Well, this definitely applies to White Album 2. Just give the first three episodes a try. 

There is a reason that it is highly rated. 




 Thanks for reminding people to flair their posts.  




 Thanks. It all made sense. I was using the retrograde marker but I was being lazy and had it on the new autopilot system. The main issue I had when landing was that the prograde and retrograde markers would flip when it changed from down to up and vicecersa. 




 Thanks.

I'll try that in the morning and let you know how it goes.

Do you happen to know of any way to prevent that from happening? 




 Yeah, I know people have done it before but it took me about 8-9 tries. For the last three times, I kept on forgetting important stuff like landing struts or a ladder.

What isn't pictured is the time I missed the Mun, the time I crashed right into it, the time where I didn't give enough time to decelerate, and the time where I ended up in an orbit around the Mun.

I just got back into KSP last night and now that my finals are over, I'll try to do more and more complicated stuff. 

EDIT: This was done in the new update. 









 Thing is, if /u/The_Dvls_Advocate really wanted to represent themselves as speaking officially, she would have clicked the "distinguish" button under her comment. That changes it from the normal to the green background that mods have.

Source: I am a mod on a few subs and every so often I have to "speak officially" which requires that button/link. 




 Considering that Sekai Project has the rights to publish Nekopara in English and this "startup" company that no one has heard of now has the rights to the 18+ version in English, one could put two and two together to realize that Denpa is a subsidary of Sekai. 




 I really need to play/read MuvLuv... 




 The hype is real. 

I'm definitely looking forward to the new user interface for building stuff as it is hard to sift through pages of objects to find the one you want. 




 Try placing a bid on a game that is less than 10000 gems. It will keep a record of your bid and will hold it for you so that as the auction goes on, where the top bidder gets it every 45 minutes, you could have a bid that wins. 




 Oh, okay. I haven't spent any time messing around with the car colors so I just listed some numbers to show what I was looking for. 

I guess what I was asking/wanting is a way for the game to take the insane colors and find the closest substitute out of the normal range.

 




 I recently played a workshop map and when I finished I got the "Diamond Medal" but looking at the time compared to the gold, silver, bronze, I should have got bronze.

[Here are two screenshots that show what I am talking about.](https://imgur.com/a/iFBwg#0)

~~Does anyone know anything about this?~~ Also, why didn't I get the bronze medal?


**EDIT: Spoke with /u/Fork-H on Steam and it seems as though it is for beating the author's time.** 




 Yeah, it could be a simple checkbox in the options screen to normalize the colors which allow it for those who want it but remove it for those who don't. 




 I recently played online for the first time and one of the players had a negative color on their car which made it really hard to see them or even see past them while playing.

I was wondering if there was a way for force negative colors to be inverted again. (ie. If the color is (-200,-30,-60) then it will be (200,30,60)) 




 WARNING: The "second season" of Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari, has some elements that would make it awkward to watch between siblings. (Look up the "Toothbrush scene".) Bakemonogatari is fine, but it would make it hard to continue the series. 




 It seems as though DenpaSoft is going to be Sekai Project's 18+ publishing name. Odds are they are doing it due to the connotations of a company being on certain sites and having 18+ content for sale elsewhere. 




 While it is early access, this isn't the developer's first game with these mechanics. Distance is, basically, a super polished and improved version of [Nitronic Rush](http://nitronic-rush.com/) which was, originally, a college project that was released online for people to download and play for free. 




 I got my last assignment done that I had to do before finals start on Friday. Now I just have to wait for the iterations of the program to finish. (It is just a matter of waiting so I don't count it as work.) 




 This is really nice of you! 




 It isn't weird, just a lazy programmer who forgot about timezones. I guess they figured that only people in Japan would access or care about this countdown. 




 If you read the top comments, the javascript used for the countdown bases itself on the user's current time, not the actual time in the world that it is supposed to end at. 




 Sorry, I don't download manga so I can't help you here. I know there are apps out there for those who want to side load manga to read. 




 I didn't either. The only reason I found out is that I went to Japan for two weeks and I wanted to read manga during the evening when I back at the ryokan. For some reason it showed all of the manga on Batoto. (In Japan of all places) 




 The reason why you feel as though the amount of manga is limited is that the developer has to censor certain titles if you are in the US. (The best way to get around this is to use a VPN that allows you to set your "country" as Japan. All you have to do now is reset the catalog in the app. Once that is done you can turn off and remove the VPN if you want to.) 




 TL Note: Keikaku means plan. 




 I wouldn't say that. The vast majority of Nintendo's titles this generation on the WiiU have all been at 60 FPS. 
























 Thankfully the MC isn't your typical harem lead.

You'll see when it is adapted. 




 Domestic na Kanojo is by the same person as Good Ending. 




 I just started playing the game on Friday and today was the first time that someone interdicted me. What I don't get is that there wasn't anything on Comms and I was able to put full pips on ENG and boost away without any issues. They didn't even try to go after me... \\_()_/
 




 I've been interested into getting a space sim game for a few years now. I backed Star Citizen back during the kickstarter but it has been a few years and not much to show for it. I tried EVE, but I felt as though it was too complicated and too far along for someone new to join, but I enjoyed playing it.

I've read a few reviews and watched a number of gameplay videos and I am wondering if it it worth getting.

In Yahtzee's Zero Punctuation review, he likened it to a space Euro Truck Simulator and I enjoyed ETS2.   




 Even as a DPS, I've noticed stuff like ST and what not filling in ~5 minutes or less. 

I can't wait until my WAR is high enough of a level to do dungeons with the so called insta-que. 




 The OP stated in the title that it wasn't on the scanalators website or on Batoto. They did as such before you posted the comment. 




 The part from the light novels is pretty lengthy but funny. Here is a snippet from volume 2 about it:

 Ah, if it isnt a Starbucks! So there was one around here, thats great, its been a long time since I drank a latte!

Does it really look like a Starbucks? Thats a

Hm?...What?...Eh?

As they got progressively closer, Amis head became progressively tilted with suspicion. Certainly, the sign looked just like that of the North American coffee chain. The round shape, the green bordering, the somewhat indistinguishable humanoid image---

Th, this is

---But that image was of the old man who owned the shop.

Sudou Coffee BarWe usually call it Sudoba 

Another thing regarding Sudobucks but this time from volume 4: 

 "Welcome to Sudobucks" As the female college student workers voice resounded, a faint voice whispered within the shop. By the way, this place is Sudou Coffee Bar. There isnt a "bucks" anywhere in the name. 


Don't ask me where to find it. Try searching online for it or something. 




 When I went it was Mahouka and Black Bullet. :(

 




 [Yoake Mae Yori Ruriiro Na](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1543/Yoake_Mae_yori_Ruriiro_na:_Crescent_Love) is special to me because while it was cliche, the series goes farther than most romance comedy anime out there. 




 If they do decide to disable abilities I hope they keep Bard's swift song. It allows me to get around faster. 




 It is taking the [tsundere trope](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere) and applying it to sharks.

The best example of tsundere for people who haven't seen anime would be Helga from "*Hey Arnold!*". 




 He/She has done some stuff in /r/anime before as well. 




 As a heads up, you are requesting not suggesting an anime. 

Suggesting on here is, basically, the same as /r/manga's "Read This!" or /r/anime's "Watch This!" tag.

I have changed your tag and approved your post.

---

On another, note you might want to look at either getting an account on an anime tracking website such as MyAnimeList (MAL) or Hummingbird. This will help people see what you have already seen and scored and give you shows to watch accordingly. 




 Yeah, for that matter we tend to get the chapter before Japan due to leaks. 




 WARNING: While it is marked appropriately, the above spoilers are for the latest manga chapter. 




 Nope, I managed to get a Raspberry Pi 2 for $37 with a case.

[Amazon Order Page](https://i.imgur.com/zQxdsFg.png) - (Personal information has been censored)

Actual Product: [Box and Pi](https://i.imgur.com/26RVsaN.jpg), [Closeup of the board](https://i.imgur.com/a9R1puk.jpg)

I'd link to the page, but I guess the realized they could get more money if they made it into a kit. 




 I was able to get both an RPi 2 and a clear case for $37 with prime shipping about a week ago. The price quickly went up from that to $48 which isn't too bad since it included a case. 




 [](#lewd) 




 I love arcades, but sadly there isn't anything nearby for me and the last one closed about six or seven years ago. 

---

I had the opportunity to go to Japan last May and they arcades there were thriving and a lot of fun. I played a lot of Groove Coaster since it was a fairly easy to learn rhythm game coming from *Osu!* and it had multiplayer. Not only that but it was three songs for 100 and if you failed, it didn't kick you off/out like IIDX.
I miss the SEGA and Taito Game Stations that I played at. The only thing I'd change about it would be to ban smoking, but smoking is pretty prevalent over there. 




 Like the others said I'd suggest that you get a MAL account or some other anime tracking website. It makes it a lot easier for people to recommend stuff.

---

Make sure you remember to flair your posts accordingly! You didn't have one, so I went ahead and added it for you. Please remember to do so in the future. (Otherwise AutoModerator will remove it after an hour.) 




 [](#lewd) 




 Nope, that is yandere. 




 Yep, you can.

For the OS you'd want to use Raspian.

The office suite should be LibreOffice which can use and save as word/powerpoint/excel documents and such.

For a web browser you might want to use Chromium. (Unless someone has a better option)

---

My concern is that your school's internet will block the Pi(s) and you won't be able to login into your network drive/space.


Not only that but you would have to set it up so that everyone has a login and someone would have to manage the permissions. 




 Check Amazon every so often. I found a listing for the Pi2 and a clear case for $37 with Prime shipping. I'd share it, but they increased the price to $48. (Which isn't too bad since it includes a case, which runs about $8-10) 




 I would figure that MLB.TV would HTML5 or something like that. I have never used it before so I have no idea. 




 The best bet would be to get:

* Raspberry Pi 2 ($35)

* HDMI Cable ($4-6 on Monoprice)

* Private Internet Access VPN (I've found that it works really reliably) $40 a year. They also have a [setup guide for a number of OS's including linux](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/).

* Micro-Sd Card ($8-12 since you'd only need an 8gb one)

* Power Adapter (An old USB Charger might do the trick)

* USB Keyboard ($15-30)

* USB Mouse ($10-30)

* MLB.tv subscription ($129.99 a year)

Setup costs: ~$260 (Includes both of the subscriptions)

Yearly after that: $170 (The two subscriptions) 




 Ignore the other guy. While I haven't read Re:Monster, I am thankful that you guys have been working on a number of light novels for people to read. 




 Hopefully one of the mods removed it since I reported it for plagarism. 




 I love how you completely, word for word, [copied my post from 8 months ago for the "How can I earn money on Rumble?" section](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/27sw0l/introducing_rumble_make_videos_and_get_paid/) rather than type up your own version of it. 

[Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/hQ5mqMH.png) for when/if OP changes it. 




 Considering that I hadn't seen a '-' in an username before, I'm sorry. I'll edit it accordingly. 




 At least you got the username right... I got my head bitten off since I didn't see the '-' before his name because of the custom flair. 




 If you look, it is the mods of /r/anime adding stuff to people's usernames. His username is only /u/-Niernen

EDIT: Make sure you remember the '-'. The + version gets upset if you get it wrong. 




 I would suggest that you reread this after the first season. You think it is good now, wait until then.

OP got the characters' traits, personalities and behaviors down to a "t". 




 That is why you leave your web browser up with something on it such as Reddit or Facebook.  




 That would take 288.461 years to complete. 




 Tip for anyone who watches anime on their computer using Media Player Classic, press "b" instead of pausing and it will instantly pause and minimize your video. 




 It isn't worth it to get it onAmazon since The Pi Hut jacked the price up $10...

I should have jumped on it when I saw it... 




 Heck, the new Rasoberry Pi has 1gb of ram on it and a quad core 1ghz processor. 




 They shouldn't since only some states have online sales tax laws and even then, most of the time, it only applies if they are selling/shipping from the state you are in. 




 I was looking at getting one from them as well. Price wise, it is $5 more than getting it from MCM/Element14 since E14's shipping is $9.99 and you don't have to wait as long. 




 The first 25-ish chapters have a lot of fan service and that is due to the publisher asking the author for something similar to his previous work, *Love Hina*. He wanted to make an action manga and he had to transition it from the harem-y series. 

After that it is a great read and it is even better when you re-read it and realize all of the foreshadowing and hints that start from the very first chapter. 




 Don't craft, do leves. Around 25 I was doing the cornmeal leve like crazy. You can buy cornmeal from the Whistling Miller in New Gridania. 




 There was a vita release in Japan. Sekai Project is back porting the vita version to the PC since the Vita version doesn't have the 18+ content. 




 Grisaia already has a Vita release. Heck, the Pc version they are bringing over is a port of the Vita version. 




 Lancer always has the worst luck. 




 A trip to Japan. $3600 for two weeks including airfare, transportation, room and some meals. It was a lot of fun and I made a lot of good memories while I was there. I'd like to go back at some point of time and explore outside of Tokyo to see the countryside and other cities such as Kyoto. 




 As a heads up, bots aren't allowed on /r/anime unless they are approved by the moderators. 




 They are, effectively, banning their rc planes from flying within a 15.677 mile radius of the White House.

Area of a circle is "pi*radius^2" and 1 Km is 0.621 miles.

(sqrt(2000/pi))*0.621= 15.677 mile radius 




 Part of the reason why there is a difference between the screaming voices is that it is really easy for English speakers to pollute their vowels when sustaining a word. 

In Japanese they only have a single vowel sound for each vowel and as such it is a lot harder for the vowel to be polluted.

For an example of a polluted vowel, try singing anything that ends in -ing and try to hold the -ing. It gets polluted. With the word "trying" try singing it as "tryic" and hold the "i" vowel then add -ng at the lat moment.

 Manga Rock censors certain titles if you are in the US, partially due to Viz but also for content for whatever reason. 




 How about installing an ad blocker? 




 I haven't heard of those sites, but if you want to do surveys and actually get paid mTurk would be your best bet. I've made ~$1000 over the past three years of off and on work.

It is owned and run by Amazon and you get paid through Amazon Payments which you can either deposit or use to get an Amazon Gift Card. 




 I sort of miss Hayate's antics but I wonder how Ell will enter the harem considering she is a robot, yet alone one made by that professor. 




 One nice thing is that all of these characters are under the Dengeki Bunko brand. Dengeki is a light novel publisher. (Light novels are basically young adult fiction titles that have an occasional illustration setting the scene or mood at the time.) 




 From what little I have played of the arcade version, there is slight conversation scenes before the fights but I have no idea if they add a story mode in the console release.

Source: I played three games of it while I was in Japan back in May of 2014. 




 It was early because the 1.00 FW of the PSP allowed anyone to run code on it. (They blocked it in 1.5, but since people could already see what and how the system worked, it didn't take too long to get hacked again.) 




 While it isn't the vita, I opened my 3DS in Akihabara and got about forty to fifty streetpasses at once.

Portable gaming is a big thing over there. 




 Thanks for that, I'll have them send it again to a different email. 




 How long does it usually take for the recruit a friend email to be sent? I had a friend send their code through the form last night and I have yet to get it. :( 




 They make machines that generate white noise. The machines will be louder and cost a lot less to run overnight. I own one since I live in a dorm and the people nearby are loud and I live right outside one of the common areas. It has helped me sleep soundly on a number of occasions.

Make sure you get one that has an actual fan rather than being a speaker otherwise you might pick up on the patterns in the audio which will annoy you more than help you. 




 Please read the Spice and Wolf light novels. :D 




 I would relist and sell them. (Unless you need the mats) 




 Share button works for screenshots on the PS4. 




 I was in Japan for two weeks and no one else from my group was around to go eat and it was after most places had closed. (8pm!) I walked down a nearby street to find somewhere to eat and tried/worked it out so I could oder some food and I ate alone. 

Either that or the time when no one else around so I walked to Akihabara by myself to explore. I, barely, knew the language but thankfully I didn't have to speak to anyone. 




 Something something thank you for the suggestion. 




 Have you seen Sakamichi no Apollon (Kids on the Slope)? They used rotoscoping for when the characters were playing music and it meshed really well. 




 Not really, but with enough cat videos on YouTube or NicoNico, they will be able to find the one close to what they want. 




 Actually, it wouldn't be too hard to do. They would just have to rotoscope a video of a cat walking for the realistic one and then animated it normally for the, well, animated cat. 




 There is also Eriri's use of alpha and bravo last episode. 




 It isn't entirely a 4-koma. There are parts where it is like a normal manga. 




 If you had read the article, this is now of the English version of the game. Japan had the crossover back in November. 




 It is an anime based off of the Disgaea games. The Prinnys are, basically, the lowest level monster/enemy/ally in the game and get a lot of crap for it. Heck, if you throw them in the game they explode! 




 There are two Final Fantasy MMO's, FFXI and FFXIV. XI has been around for over 13 years and XIV is the newer of the bunch. 

I've only played XIV, but I really really like it. (There is a free trial as well so if you want to try it before you buy you can) 




 I've been leveling a cul and what I have been doing is finding certain items that do not have a listing on the market and put stuff up for sale at a much higher price. I've been able to sell a low-ish level dish for 1250 gil a piece and the mats run ~200 per and if I HQ it can sell up to 1750 for the same item.

You can take this idea and use it with the other crafting jobs/classes. You might want too look at making and selling housing items as people always need furniture. 




 I think shard prices will go up a bit due to the one method, other than mining/grinding them, getting fixed. 

For those you wondering, you had to: 

1. Accept a triple turn-in leve that had a shard (or other reward bonus)
2. Turn in twice for the rewards
3. Abandon
4. Get the same leve again. (It used to keep the rewards as they were. If you were getting 48 fire shards per turn in, you could always get 48 fire shards per turn in as long as you did the above method) 




 I've love to win. It would help pay for my studies as I found out I have to go an extra year. 




 If you search on Bing for (30-90 searches which depends on the account and "status") while logged into an account, you accumulate points (15-30 per day depending on the account's status). After 450 points, when your account is "gold" you can get a $5 Amazon gift card.

It takes ~2-3 weeks to get enough points to get one, but you can have up to five accounts per household. 




 I use bing for the rewards. (Helps pay for my subscription too) 




 I haven't read the LNs, but my guess is that the transfer student is the girl from the first episode that Tor beat. 




 Just wish to go to Ezorzea in FFXIV after they add the gold saucer in update 2.51! 




 Zalarea is small in terms in population and there are some guilds (Free Companies) to watch out for such as Evil, but overall I've liked it and I've started to notice the same people while traveling around. 




 What server are you on? If you are Zalarea, shoot me a PM and I can introduce you to a really good FC that likes to help people out. (Heck, they've basically been there for me every dungeon that I have had to do. They've also helped me with gear and what not.) The people are really nice and they won't go after you for DPS issues or even getting aggro'd if you are a DPS. 




 I'd love to get that Key magazine/poster/art-book.

(It is in the left-most box and you can see "Key" on it) 




 Get triple turn in leve - Turn in two times - "Do it later" - Abandon - Rinse and repeat. 




 Try looking for turn-ins that you can buy from NPCs such as cornmeal if you are leveling CUL. 




 The best one I found was the level 30 Cornmeal leve in Limsa Lominsa. Go and buy cornmeal from the Whistling Miller in Old Gridania. Cornmeal is 51 gil x 6 per turn in and I was getting 48 shards per. 

On my server, fire shards go for 120-150 gil each. (Basically, the profit is about 5450 gil per turn in.) (I did ~40 levequests, which brought me from level 29 CUL to level 37 CUL and I got ~4200 shards from it all) 




 Sadly it is 300000 gil... 




 At least it isn't [DRR!](http://archive.uboachan.net/yn/src/1249719241125.jpg) (WARNING: Image is from *The Enigma of Amigara Fault*. It is creepy) 




 I did this a few times with my emerald/topaz carbuncle to make quests easier.

Another thing I did was just the rouge's hide ability to skip a large chunk of the level 10 quest rather than fighting. 




 Thank you for reminding people to use the appropriate flair! 




 Like /u/semajdraehs said, you had the wrong flair. You are **request**ing a show, not giving a show (**suggest**ing for people to watch.)

I have changed it accordingly, but please remember to flair correctly in the future. 




 No problem! 

This is how I notice it at a glance since I have forgotten what little I learned from two semesters of it:

Hiaragana () - Curvy simple characters

Katakana () - Straight simple characters

Kanji () - (More) Complex characters 




 For those of us who use feet and inches, she is 6ft 1in. 




 Argh,  isn't kanji but katakana. 

 




 I'm new to subscription MMOs and MMOs in general. 

What happens to our subscriptions when/if the servers are down for an extended period of time? Does SQ not deduct a day or are we just out of luck for that day of the subscription? 




 Yep, getting 2002 error. :( 




 If that is the case you ought to read the light novels. The novels have been published in English up to, I think, volume 12.

The first season covers volumes 1 and 2. The second season covers volumes 3 and 5. 




 Well, I'll change that...

Wait... That is what you want us to think... 




 What server are you on? 

On the server that I am on, Zalarea, the FC that I am in, Heart, likes to help new players go through the content without rushing. Case in point, I am really new and they either ask around through the linkshell or their friends if they would be interested in running ____ dungeon with me.

I felt bad last night when I tried the daily roulette, we had a tank that was in level 50 gear and was running ahead but there was a new player. I felt bad that half the members of the party were speedrunning it and forgoing the experience and story that the new player was missing. 




 It doesn't even air in Japan until the 23rd so this is pretty early by Crunchyroll standards. 




 "Request" is the wrong flair for this, "Identification X" fits what you are asking better. I have changed it as such, but please remember to flair accordingly in the future. 




 As a heads up you'll want to flair this with the "Question" flair for this sort of question in the future. I have done as such for you this time, but please remember to flair your posts accordingly from here on out. 




 I know a guy that is really into Razer stuff. I'm trying to get him to use better headphones but no, if Razer releases it he has to buy it.

I don't get people some days... 




 If you are in the US and you are 18 or older, you ought to sign up for Mturk. 

It is run by Amazon and you can get Amazon Gift Cards by buying it through what you earn from Mturk. 

Personally, I've made about $1000 over three years of off and on work. There are times where I'll forget about it for spans of 3-4 months as college gets busy and I have to focus on that.

This site is a bit different from your typical beer money site. This is a bit more professional. You work for "requesters" and they approve or reject your submitted content called "hits." Many people here think this great and it often gets them more money than other sites. They do require more personal info from you than the sites above for tax reasons (even though you likely won't have to worry about it) and not everyone gets approved to work here.

 gt;   Age minimum: 18

 gt; Offers: Different tasks requesters want you to do for money

 gt; Payout: Amazon Payments balance or bank account

 gt; Referral Incentive: None

 gt; TIPS

 gt;  Dont use mturk without having [turkopticon](http://microwork-dev.ucsd.edu/) installed. Its a browser add-on that allows workers to post reviews about requesters and gives you a good idea of whether or not to attempt a HIT based on the requesters reputation.

 gt;  Only do hits that pay at least 10/minute. Mturk grind forum and /r/hitsworthturkingfor are good places to check for worthy hits.

 gt;  It is better to return a hit (it will not negatively impact you) than submit if you are unsure whether the requester will approve it. 




 [This](http://yokohama-theatre.com/en/component/comprofiler/userprofile/graigrussell) could very well be him. (It links to the Yokohama Theatre Group) I didn't find anything on MAL so this might be his first anime related work. 




 Yeah, that was really good English coming from the commentator in the beginning. Heck, they might have brought in a native speaker for it. Someone might want to check the credits to see who did the voice over for it. 




 I, personally, liked the anime but I have heard that Alicia is made to be more of a "[tsundere](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere)" than she was in the game. (TV Tropes warning)

They also kept the watercolor/colored pencil look of the game which is pretty interesting.

I'd say that if you like the game it might be a good idea to, at least, try the anime. 




 You might want to give some information and/or constructive thought rather than just linking to the MyAnimeList page for it.

 




 You can always change the flair by going on your web browser, even on your phone, and doing it like you would on a PC.

I have changed it as such, but please remember to select accordingly in the future. 




 This is a TV special, which is an OVA, and they tend to be fairly fan service heavy in order to have people watch/buy it.

My guess is that the main show will have a lot less fan service than this. 




 Best tip for this one is to figure out how to get airborne and then stay near the track. I made it down once but I had no idea where to go... :( 




 You can also use 7-zip, which is freeware, to un-rar a rar file!

On a related note, thanks for doing this! 




 thatsthejoke.jpg 




 What is funny though is that while they are having fan service, the characters are discussing the merits of said fan service. The entire thing, out of what I have watched of the episode, seems to be highly self-referential and sort of meta. 




 I would contact Amazon as that isn't acceptable. You paid for the 650 so you should be getting the 650. 




 I think it is a cultural thing. Case in point, while I was in Japan I went to Mandarake, which is a used anime/manga/cd/goods store and bought stuff that seemed new. Heck, I opened the Clannad OST and it had all of the original inserts and the only issue is that the box that holds the case for the trifold cd case is losing its adhesiveness which is something I attribute to it being 11 years old. The same thing for the Little Busters OST I got but there weren't any flaws. For that matter, it might was well have been new.

One of the professors I was with on the trip said that since there is the belief in the culture that everything has a spirit that it is to be treated with utmost care and this permeates their way of life. 




 You might want to look at the FiiO X1 or even the Sansa Clip. Both can play a lot more formats than the stock iPod Classic and you can even add more storage, up to 128 GB, through the use of a Micro SD card.

As a heads up, if you get the Sansa Clip, look into installing [Rockbox](http://www.rockbox.org) on it as it will allow a lot more formats and such. 




 That scene was in Angel Beats.  




 Not OP, but I have been to the Tokyo Anime Center before. Admittance is free and you are allowed to take photos but the use of flash is discouraged as it can fade the sketches and such. 




 I am fairly new, but this is my mentality:

* Need - When you know you need it for the current class or one that you are working on.

* Greed- When I'd really like said item.

* Pass - When I have no use for the item. I also do this once I get an item in the dungeon as someone else could use the loot.

 You might want to avoid using YouTube's stabilization feature/effect. When I attempted to watch your video I couldn't look at it for more than ten seconds without feeling sick.
 




 Atr is, basically, a mall that is directly attached to the Akihabara train station so the doors to it is a prime advertising opportunity.  




 The typesetting is wrong. =Isla

 = a (Sounds like "ah" in English)

 = i (Sounds like "e" in English)

 = ra (The sound for "r" in Japanese is the same as how it is in Spanish)

I'm not sure where the s came from, but that is Isla's name in katakana which is how it was written on the board.

---

Edit: Just for fun, the other two names are right but I'll also give the katakana spelling of it.

 (Zakku) - The , when it is small like that, is used for the repetition of the consonant after the character and it is expressed in as a pause which results in an emphasis.

 (Tsukasa) - It is interesting that his name is also listed in katakana rather than the hiragana/kanji for it as katakana is normally reserved for foreign words/names that are listed for japanese pronunciation.  




 Yep, if you go back to the first fight between Archer and Saber it shows Archer saying "Trace On" without being able to hear it. 




 k 




 That is closer to a TLC (Translation Checker) than a proofreader. Typically a proofreader is someone who checks just the English for grammatical errors and such. 




 Apparently the manga has a nutritionalist/chef on board in order to make the dishes sound, look and actually be possible to make while tasting good.

 [Done.](https://strawpoll.me/4250793) 




 As for the flair, even I'm not sure. My thought might be to list it under [Questions] rather than [Meta] but then again the weekly thread is listed as [Meta]. To each their own I guess. 




 **BOOM!** The end. 









 If the website I used to make a gif is right, it should go for 2 hours and then stop in accordance with /u/dabritian's wishes. I haven't looked to make sure. 




 As a heads up, you have the wrong flair on your post. 

You had: [Suggestion]

What you should have used: [Request]

I have changed it accordingly, but please remember to flair your posts correctly in the future. 




 I present to you, [Brick: The Animation.](https://i.imgur.com/O3R7eNl.gif) 




 I'm 5ft 9in and when I went to Japan, I felt tall. Some of the people on my trip who were 6ft+ had to duck to get in and out of some places like Takeo had to. 




 Just giving you a heads up, there is a lot of drama in the series and some people feel as though it is forced. 




 Have you tried holding R while clicking on the save? It would boot you into recovery to which you can then install the CFW.

 [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUamHEvVQy0) is my favorite instrumental cover of *Cruel Angel's Thesis*. 




 Huh, maybe Steins;Gate isn't that far off. 




 Yeah, if I remember correctly that was the main reason the US Mint stopped doing that. 




 It is basically an updated version of the old US Mint airline millage method people used a number of years back. People buy money for a 1:1 transaction right from the US Mint using their credit card and then use the cash to pay off their credit card, keeping the points. 




 How in the world can you get from the US to Japan for $300? I could see how $3000 would work, but not $300! 




 As for a Japanese comparison, the *Kyoukai Senjou no Horizon* series could compare in scope as the first volume alone is thicker than some full dictionaries.  




 Do it! The HD659's are available from Adorama Camera for ~$275 right now and their MSRP is $500. 




 For those of you in Japan, it is actually a really cool museum that focuses on science and technology. 

I was able to go to Miraikan last year and it was one of my favorite museums out of the ones my class trip went to. (It is also pretty close to the 1:1 Gundam as well) 




 Some examples I have found: 

* The avatar for "god" in NouCome being that of the failed restoration painting.

* A character's avatar in *Asobi ni Ikuyo* is named "[Ender](https://i.imgur.com/3opJA94.jpg)" from the titular book *Ender's Game*. [A W Fast Food Restaurant](https://i.imgur.com/a3QzHTl.jpg) in the same episode. The teacher's computer is called [HAL.](https://i.imgur.com/paTy6ZJ.jpg)

* The book "Hyperion" showing up in The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. 




 I've noticed that every so often, I'll find a reference to a piece of western media in the anime that I watch. 

What are some examples of this and what is referencing? More importantly, why was it referenced in the context of the plot?
 




 /u/automoderator  picks up a lot of the slack when it comes to smaller subreddits, especially with a set of well defined rules and actions. 




 Probably for the DVD and Blurays 




 I never knew that the guys behind CotN, made Incredibots! I loved that flash game as a kid and I remember making a number of rube goldberg contraptions in it. 




 You might want to give some more direction than just light novels, as it gives those who respond a better sense of what you like or would hold your interest.

In any case, you might want to check out /u/ugotmal's really good ["Introduction to Light Novels" post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/2z7yio/looking_to_get_into_light_novels_but_dont_know/) as it lists a number of good series that people have liked. 

Rather than a light novel, I'd like to suggest an OEL web novel series, ["Until Death?"](http://www.royalroadl.com/fiction/629) that is hosted over on Royal Road. (I do not normally read fan fiction, but this one was suggested over on /r/lightnovels and I really enjoyed it.) There is a prequel, but I would suggest reading UD first. 




 I wish he had used Hinagiku's old design rather the the "new" one. 




 This is more common in shoujo manga adaptations than from other demographics. So, yes, this is "allowed" in anime but shoujo adaptations are fairly rare nowadays. 




 I'm surprised that no one caught how, in the beginning of the episode, there was a single blue bird and a single fish but after the confession there was a couple for both the fish and bird.

The only issue is that one of the birds should have been a paler color rather than both being vibrant. (Normally the vibrant birds are males and the duller ones are female.)

EDIT: Same with the dogs and their handlers/owners. 




 It is possible, follow the guides but put the INSTALL.ZIP in the TNV folder rather than the game save.

You'll transfer the tnv save rather than the ape escape save. 




 You have to add it to the TNV folder not the game save. I had the same issue when transferring over some backed up PSP games that I own. 




 They have also done a few mobile games and such as well.  




 Not so much "Getting really huge", but there is always [White Album 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18245/White_Album_2). **Do NOT watch White Album** as other than sharing a song, it is not related. They are even from different source material as WA as a management sim like idolm@ster and WA2 was an visual novel. 




 Lets try and figure out if it is possible.  This napkin math, so it is only in the ball park:

----

Hours of anime per season (aniHour): (35 shows * 12 episodes * 23.5 minutes)/60 minutes = 164.5

Hours of anime per year (aniYear): aniHour * 4 = 658

Hours per year, including leap day: 8766

Approximate years that anime has been solidly running: 40

Total hours of anime so far (airedHours): aniYear * 40 = 26320 hours

Days to finish all anime (without catching up with currently airing) (curAirTime): airedHours / 24 = ~1098 (3.006 years or ~ 3 years and 2 days)

Hours of anime aired during completion (compCatch): 3.006 * aniYear = ~3952 hours

Completing that set: (compCatch / 24) = ~165 days

\# of Seasons while completing set #1: 165/(365.25/4) = 1.80698

Time to complete set #2: 1.80698*658 = ~1200 hours (50 days)

Catching up again: 50/(365.25/4) = 0.5475 seasons * aniHour = 360 hours (~15 days)

Catching up #4: ((15/(365.25/4)) * aniHour) = 108.09 hours (~4.5 days)

---

TL;DM: **3 years and 221.5 days (31596 hours)** of non-stop anime watching to catch up to what has and will be aired. This does NOT account for movies or other forms of anime.

Also, long running and dual/split season shows are part of the 35 shows a season. 




 Another tip for when you are shopping for stuff in Akihabara or Nakano Broadway, find what you want and make a mental note about it and how much it was but then go around the look for it again. 

Case in point, I was able to find [this](http://myfigurecollection.net/item/111864) Saber figure for ~$12 in one store and $29 in another and both of them were in Nakano Broadway.  




 /u/Internets might have only seen Amagi Brilliant Park, where Moffle was the main park mascot. (The author of FMP and Amagi are the same and they got the license to reuse the same character designs in Amagi.)

 Fell free to recommend visual novels unlike what some users might state. There are ~27.5k subscribers on here so more people will see it than other places. 




 I like these posts as often time the episode comes out while I am in class or away from my computer and it allows me to get a feel for how the episode will go when I watch it. 




 I've seen the horrors that are "Sanrio Puroland", I am still scarred by it. 

Imagine "It's A Small World" from any of the Disney parks, crank it up to 11 and then coupled with "Hello Kitty" stuff and put in all in Japanese and you have Sanrio Puroland. 




 Thing is, HMA is not a VPN but a proxy. 




 It looks pretty fun, sort of like a cross of Mirror's Edge and Distance/Nitronic Rush.

The key to this would be how the controls are as it could make or break this. 




 Yeah, I thought I got the F/Z soundtrack as well but I ended up getting the OST for the radio drama rather than the anime. Oops. Heck, it is still sealed at home. I guess that is why it was ~$3. 




 This is a little bit different of a request as it isn't, directly, of an anime.

What are some really good anime soundtracks that can stand on their own for listening to?

So far, I own the soundtracks to:

* Clannad
* Little Busters
* Angel Beats
* Girls und Panzer

I'm looking to get, sometime in the near future:

* Cowboy Bebop (All three soundtracks)
* Sora no Woto
* Suzumiya Haruhi no Gensou (This is the live orchestral performance of the OST and some insert songs)

Amazon.co.jp charges ~$12 per shipment overseas and $2-3 per item so I'm trying to save on shipping. 




 I wasn't finding fault! It is just that there are only three human moderators with /u/chiefnoah helping with the CSS and we can't catch everything.

(Thankfully AutoModerator is a lot of help) 




 When you see something like this, please report it! I only caught it since I was looking through /new/. 




 I never said that you said it was empty. My reply was based off of your "You need to put stuff there for him [the player] to find." to which I pointed out some examples that I know of off the top of my head. 




 The developers did put things out there for people to find even when the player has no need to head over there such as the chair and wine overlooking the sea to the cheese wheel shield on top of the hill in Crestwood. 




 You don't have to grind at all. The developers made it clear to the player that they are to keep on moving and explore the world. If you want to stay in the Hinterlands, good and it would be a massive grind but you'd have so much "power" that the rest of the game that they designed the player to see would be trivial and glossed over. 

Source: Went to a keynote last week by the creative developer of the Dragon Age and Mass Effect series at ECGC. 




 What is cool about this is that you can actually find and run, in time with the song the level on your own. There are about three fail points and they are all early on. (Less than 90 seconds in) I remember showing this to people in high school on an emulator. 




 Here is a black and white'd then inverted version of this episode's end card if people want to see the line work. Link: https://i.imgur.com/uVb8NJ3.png

 I think they are wondering how Archer and the other guy can create numerous blades out of thin air and throw them over a long distance in a ranges attack.  




 If you are out there shooting, things will happen for you. If youre not out there, youll only hear about it.  Jay Maisel

EDIT: For some context, Jay Maisel is one of the more famous natural light photographers. You may not know it, but you have most likely seen his work. 




 Plus Asakura hummed *Hare Hare Yukai* while cooking in the last episode. They know what the fans want to see and hear when it comes to the Haruhi series. (Man, I hope this sells well enough to encourage a third season that goes past Disappearance) 




 If you like them, look into getting turkey breasts or thighs instead of legs. The legs have a lot of tendons and extra bits that makes it harder to eat. 




 Psst, if you ever want to know why you tagged a certain person click on the tag (like you would to edit it) and copy the link in the "link" section. That gives you the post where you tagged that user. 




 The manga is really good but sadly isn't available officially in English. It switches between regular manga and 4-koma as the need arises which is nice as you get the benefits of both. The art is really good as well. 

Source: I own the first volume in Japanese. 




 No, but he can scroll through the comments on his account and see how many times he has been asked that question. 




  That being said, I did think that something might be up when the show displayed the Yamaha logo without switching it to something else (Yamada, Yawaha, etc).

Well, Shigatsu no Uso had the Steinway logo and pianos in the show but I don't think Steinway helped fund the anime. Odds are they bought the licensing rights to the visuals and sounds of the various instruments from Yamaha. 









 Crazy thing is, they have the original voice cast so _____ is voiced by the same person. 




 The answer is yes, but _____ has a slightly different personality. (If you watch the first episode it is evident who I am referring to.) 




 When in doubt, go to one of the FORD topics:

**F**amily

**O**ccupation

**R**ecreation

**D**irection (Goals) 




 The only bad part about it is that there are only 4 routes, but there are enough developed characters to have 7 or more. (I think the fandisk has these routes, but they are not in the base game.) 




 I'm not the person you responded to, but I have heard good things about Private Internet Access. ($40 a year) According to Lifehacker and TorrentFreak, PIA doesn't keep logs of your traffic. 




 Second season started today! 




 Oops, I haven't seen the episode yet. (I've been away from my computer all day) 




 That is 3143.333 days of continuous operation. (~9 years and 4 months) 




 Pretty much wait for the thread by /u/shadoxfix to come out since he has a bot running on his account that will instantly post a related episode discussion thread.

 Better yet, while the osu!coin thing was an april fools joke, they added a bindable key in the "inputs" section to allow a faster retry than CTRL+R. Default is ~ (to the left of the 1 on a QWERTY keyboard) but I changed mine to Left CTRL. 




 I know a guy who is in his mid-thirties and he is still doing stuff like that. It is really sad to see as a college student that some people can't step back and see what they are doing to themselves and others. 




 There are more ways to obtain logins than breaching the servers such as people using the same password everywhere and their account login for another site was compromised. They could have brute-forced the passwords off of a known password dictionary as well. 




 It is slice of life and sports anime wrapped in a light-hearted fantasy shell with characters who look somewhat like animals. 




 Okay, who is going to make a new CMDR with a sequence of six numbers starting with the number six? 




 I'm fairly new to the game and I took a break for about ten months as I was busy or I was playing other games. I've only ever played against the AI and I was wondering how I could do better or improve my CS.

Lately I've been playing Ahri as mid, but I've felt squishy at times. What are some basic tips for someone who is new and plays Ahri? 




 I'm not the dev, but I have played against him multiple times and he was really receptive of the feedback. Heck, I noticed something fishy on the Arcade leaderboards, sent a PM on reddit and he responded and took care of it. 




 Not sure if you are being sarcastic. They are just doing that with the adaptation of *The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki* which is starting either next week or the following. 




 I'd like to win, it would help a lot with paying my tuition. 




 When I'm by myself, and sometimes when I think no one else is around, I'll talk myself through my schedule for the day or the next few hours. I've found that it has improved my time management, but I don't leave enough time to relax and if I miss or mess up throughout the day it makes me feel worse.

An example of what I say to myself: "Get up, get dressed, go to class, lunch, back to room, work on ______, go to class, back to my room, dinner, room." (Where tim in my room means that i am working on stuff unless I am done or it is too late to be coherent) 




 Through looking at the traffic on a recent post of mine, I found that a website is rehosting any and all content that reaches the front page of a certain subreddit. 

Is this allowed? If not, what can I do to report it? 




 If you want a story where the actual Roman Empire and a modern military fought, there is [this comment series](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/k067x/could_i_destroy_the_entire_roman_empire_during/) from /u/Prufrock451 where he writes a story with this exact scenario.

Warner Brothers bought the rights to the story to make it into a movie, but nothing has come to fruition yet. There is a subreddit for it: /r/RomeSweetRome. 




 I have fixed your flair. You had it as "Suggestion" but the correct one was "request" since you are *request*ing show(s) to watch.

Please remember to select the correct flair next time. 




 Thankfully once you are through the mailslot, you don't have to worry about oxygen. 




 I wasn't buying rares, but hawking commodities 9ly each way for 1.5k a ton one way and 300 the other. 

I never knew about rares... 




 I am not the person you responded to, but I guess I did it wrong. I started out by doing commodity trading in a sidewinder then an adder and then a cobra. I recently decided to try fighting in RES and it is a lot more fun, especially since I don't have to toil away at making 25k credits every ten or so minutes. 




 I've found that following its recommendations for what squares to pick to be the best ones. (There is some liberty when it has multiple ones and they are in no particular order when that happens) 




 It determined, based on your entries, that the diagonal from the Upper Left to the Bottom Right was the best option to choose. Expected MGP is the average of the possible results based upon the possible unknown numbers. It just so happened that you got the 3600 MGP result, which is the second highest result in the mini cactpot. 




 Anything that pays over 100 MGP is considered a profit. Not every card has a 1 2 3 sequence in it. This program helps the user determine what is the highest paying row/column/diagonal to choose based upon the known numbers. 




 Considering the attribution along the top, probably none. I, originally, had this done and ready for people to use back on February 27th which was before these sites implemented his code. I didn't release it because I was unsure of what license he wanted the code to be released under. I released it now because it has been two and a half weeks since the last post from him and I am unsure if, or when, I will even hear back.

If that site is working for you, then great! 

The only reason people would want to use this code/program is if they wanted something that they could easily open rather than remembering to go to those types of sites. 




 The CS program here uses linux, fedora to be exact, and it is more so on the algorithmic side of things rather than the functional code that an end user would use. 

It is what it is, what I should do is learn how to do GUIs in my spare time since it would be useful.

**Nitty, gritty details:**

---

**Who am I:** I am a senior in college going for a BS in Computer Science and a BA in Communications - Interactive Media and Game Design. I have been using C and C++ for the past four years and have done a number of projects using the language.

A while back, I saw /u/Aureolux's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/2x7m81/i_made_another_cactpot_solver_web_app/coygzrs?context=3) where he posted a perfect cactpot solver with the hopes that it would be useful for someone. Well, I took the program and fiddled around with it and made it as such that the user no longer has to define their squares by setting the values within the program itself nor do they have the compile it multiple times in a effort to solve one mini-cactpot.

The algorithm is not ideal, but it can brute-force all of the possibilities within a second or so with a single square defined and after that it gets faster.

I've tried to make it easy to use. For example, if you had the number 4 in the bottom right, in the program you would put "br 4" (Without the quotes of course). **It does not have a GUI interface**, but prompts from a command-line box since I do not know how to do GUI stuff on Windows.

I contacted /u/Aureolux about two and a half weeks ago asking him what license he would like for this program to be released under but I have yet to hear anything. Considering that he just uploaded it online to mediafire and provided a link, I have put it under the MIT License.

**Downloads**

**Here is the link to the github**: https://github.com/test_subject8528/FFXIV_Perfect_Cactpot

If you just want the exe file, it is within the /bin/ folder. 

The [VirusTotal for the binary came up with 3 detections](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/39a6d4f639d17448e8e95e394a8b30d102da7ecd3f237eca046f7199a6b83c2b/analysis/1426565888/) from "Cyren", "F-Prot" and "Rising" antivirus. 

**The .cpp file is clean**, according to [VirusTotal.](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/5141b7e0d4d9c78cdf5503404246797129c4a618039f60e0c5afe3e765f59d41/analysis/1426566707/) Odds are, the three programs view the GCC compiler as weak or used to create malware enough that it just outright blocks it.

All I did was compile the .cpp file using [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) with the included GCC compiler. **If you do not trust the file, feel free to download and compile it yourself!** 




 Heck, doing "000[K|k]" (without the quotes) has blocked 99% of the gil spam that I used to get.

It has, definitely, made playing the game more fun since I am not getting a message every two to three minutes.

 I remember seeing this faction over in Brani and Cupis areas. 




 The bass part from Mozart's Requiem. It is useless because I was part of a choir that did it a year ago. While I can still sing it, I do not have any opportunities to do it right now... :( 

It is a fun piece to do as well. 




 You don't, necessarily, need an amp for the 650s. My old iPod classic can drive them pretty well. 




 Jeez, it seems as though every month or so someone has beaten the previous LoZ:OoT speedrun. 

I wonder when the first sub 18 run will come out. 




 The other issue with the piano is whether or not Steinway would allow the figure maker to produce a scale model of their pianos. Granted, grand pianos are pretty similar in design, but the fans who would be buying said figures would demand quality rather than a substitution.  




 How does the DAC in the iPod Classic (5th) gen stack up compared to Fiio's or other DAPs?

I've been running my classic with rockbox for the past few months now and I like it but I was wondering if there was something better that has larger storage capabilities through micro SDs and what not that I should be looking at.

 




 At this point, other than some of the backer rewards you aren't missing too much. I think Sekai will have the physical version available for people to buy when the game comes out and it will also be on Steam which means that you can get it on day one when it releases.

If you wanted the OST, it is available on the US iTunes along with Key's other CDs. (The only thing you'd be missing here is the booklet which has the lyrics, vocal sheet music, comments and the nice three cd case.) -- That is based off the Japanese physical release of the OST and may not reflect that of the Kickstarter release. 




 You can go in wherever, but the common courtesy that players have started to do is go in/out on the side with green lights to help minimize collisions. 




 Unless you only reddit from a mobile device. 




 It could also be stuck in the LA Harbor blockade/strike. A lot of imports from Japan are getting held up by that. That is why, in part, stuff like the WiiU Gamecube Adapter are hard to find. 




 It is, it is a what if _________ hadn't done _________ and it became _______.  




 It just happened to me and I am wonder how it turned out for others. 




 Not so much fan fiction but it is an official side story that tells a what-if when it comes to a certain event. 




 I guess it makes sense. I found it weird that the Federation had big red skulls outside their outposts.

It was just jarring to open the map and get confronted with a lot of red dots. 




 I just installed 1.2 and I went into the Galaxy map and every color is opposite of what it was in 1.1.

What I mean by flipped is that Federation - Empire and Alliance - Independent have swapped colors.

Federation used to be blue and now it is red. Alliance used to be yellow and now it is green.

I am using the standard HUD colors so this couldn't be the cause of the issue.


How can I fix this or is this something that FD purposefully did? 




 My thought is that if they found a massive issue while applying the update to the servers that people would still have the 1.1 client and they could revert the servers and allow people to continue to play. 




 It might be the surprise hit, but there is a lot of contention this coming season for AOTS: (Note that I am listing the big name ones, not what I feel as though could be AOTS)

* Disappearance of Nagato Yuki - (aka More Haruhi and it has the original voice cast)

* Fate/Stay Night - Unlimited Blade Works S2

* Gintama

* High School DxD BorN - (While it is an ecchi series, it has been hyped up quite a bit)

* Hibike! Euphonium - (KyoAni doing a music show)

* Hello! Kiniro Mosaic

* Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha Vivid - (While it isn't popular on here, the series is well received and has a lot of fans)

* Nisekoi S2

* Knights of Sinonia S2

* Shokugeki no Souma - (Well received manga)

* Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru Zoku - (aka Yahari S2)

* Yamada-lun to Nananin no Majo - (Manga is well received and people like the characters) 




 That isn't too bad, about 20 more minutes. 




 /u/orniver is poking fun at this series compared to Bake*monogatari*, Nise*monogatari*, *Monogatari* Second Season, etc which are all parts of a larger story/series.

While *monogatari* may invoke that notion, the word "monogatari" means "story".  




  New repair sequence feature; if one of your modules is destroyed, you can cannibalize parts from another module to repair it.

This would have helped yesterday as I had my thrusters shot out by an NPC. (That is what I get for trying to run rather than fighting.) 
























 It is interesting that there are some games, like F/SN, that are longer than the Bible. (The NIV translation of the Bible clocks in at 726,109 words) 




 That isn't even the largest amount of words in a literary work. The Wheel of Time series has 4,410,036 words. (Yes, that is 4.4+ million words) 




 The light novel has been translated father than the manga and there is even the anime which is starting in the beginning of July. 




 That is why we no longer use capes! 




 Off the top of my head:

Attack on Titan, Log Horizon, Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Baccano, Kekkai Sensen, Psycho Pass (Some questionable content in first episode), Zetsuen no Tempest, Xam'd: Lost Memories (This was released in the US before it was in Japan as it was, originally, exclusive to PSN),

last but not least ~~Space Dandy~~. (Forgot about the take on Hooters) 




 There is also [T-Rex no Kanojo](http://myanimelist.net/manga/88537/T-Rex_na_Kanojo), which is pretty good but there aren't too many chapters out.

You might want to check out the [recommendations on MAL from Monster Musume.](http://myanimelist.net/manga/36213/Monster_Musume_no_Iru_Nichijou/userrecs) 




 Why limit yourself to one? You are dealing with a genie, ask for more! (Well, not too much as you want to avoid flooding the market) 




 It is about the same amount of text as the main Lord of the Rings Trilogy which sits about ~470000 words.

Witcher 3 has less text than Final Fantasy VII which has ~600000 words. 




 The person you replied to is the guy who is making it. 




 I know for R;B1 they kept the main plot points but reworked the scenes enough that people consider it to be two separate games.

EDIT: They also revamped the graphics and replaced some of the characters. [The Wikipedia entry about it goes into more detail.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperdimension_Neptunia_%28video_game%29#Hyperdimension_Neptunia_Re.3BBirth_1) 




 It is half off as well so if you've played the first it might be a good idea to pick it up now. 

I just started R;B1, so I'm not sure how R;B2 changed in terms of combat and what not. 




 Depends on a number of things:

* Number of hunts fought in,

* Looted gear

* Raids/Dungeons run 

* First time bonus in raids/dungeons

* Progress on Relic weapon

* etc...

Thankfully, the game doesn't require an instantaneous jump from i50 to i90 as the 3 main raids (LOTA, ST, WoD) are (i50, i70, i90 respectively)

I'd say about 20-30 hours of gameplay. (Maybe more, maybe less, depends on the amount of grind you want to do within a period of time.) 




 Worked for me! I tried it last time they did a promo, but it had ended so I hadn't made an account. 




 The only identification you have to provide is your SSN, which is used for tax purposes. 




 If you are in the US, you can use mTurk and it pays to an Amazon Payment account or you can cash it directly for an Amazon gift card. This is what I do when I want to buy something without spending from my bank account or credit card. 




 You'll need to increase your item level to at least 90. (This is the number above your character) 




 800 




 I'm surprised that no one caught how the starting line sign is similar to the [Crash Team Racing logo.](https://i.imgur.com/3RpHFmw.jpg) 




 I know this is a bit old, but for those of you wondering, the number that Chain called, which gives the time of day, is real. While it isn't in Japanese, NIST provides a Telephone Time-of-Day Service and it, "is used to synchronize clocks and watches and for the calibration of stopwatches and timers."

Here is the website about it: http://www.nist.gov/pml/div688/grp40/ttds.cfm

 Heck, I've gotten spoofed calls that claim to be my phone number. How wrong is that? 




 The main connotation is that someone could have been using your internet for nefarious purposes (copyright infringement, illegal goods/services) and you would be responsible.

The best way to fix it is to completely uninstall the extension and program and check the registry for any lingering files and such. 




 With the hobbit, it is ~600,000 words. 




 Here are a few that I found off of MAL that might work:

* [Natsume Yuujinchou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4081/Natsume_Yuujinchou)

* [Sakamichi no Apollon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12531/Sakamichi_no_Apollon) - Focuses on Jazz in Japan during the late 1960s

* [Chihayafuru](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10800/Chihayafuru) - A really good shoujo adaptation that is popular with both genders

* [Zetsuen no Tempest](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14075/Zetsuen_no_Tempest) - Really good mix of fantasy and reality (Draws upon Shakespeare for inspiration) 




 For good reason considering that the manga for Nodame was published in a Josei magazine. (Josei is the term for the older women, 18-30ish, demographic.) 




 Their MAL was in their flair.

 While it isn't an anime, *Ready Player One* will be getting adapted as a movie and Steven Spielberg will be directing it. 

[Source](http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/25/spielberg-directing-ready-player-one/) 




 To give people an idea on the length (word count):

* Lord of the Rings (Main Trilogy Only): ~470,000

* Final Fantasy VII: ~600,000

* Mistborn Trilogy: 693,428

* Bible (NIV): 726,109

* F/SN VN: 820,595 (Based upon the English word count)

* --- UBW Route: 219,495

* Wheel of Time series: **4,410,036** (This is not a typo) 




 "[Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5781/Isekai_no_Seikishi_Monogatari)" would be a perfect fit. 




 No, you're right. 




 "Row-ri" would be a passable pronunciation of it, but you would have to keep in mind that it would be the "Ro" from "Row" without the "w" at the end. Technically, it is closer to "R-ri" 




 The reason for it is that an "o" followed by an "u" is pronounced by holding the "o" sound for another syllable length rather than saying "o" then "u" and it is denoted by the smaller katakana (or hiragana should it be in hiragana).  




 Not so much a song, but an artist. I recently found out about the Vitamin String Quartet and they have been doing string covers of popular songs and some original stuff, they have ~250 albums out all focusing of a different artist or album that they are covering.


A friend used their music during their wedding and I can't stop listening to their stuff. 




 You could always send it through Waifu2x and have it upscale the image. (It does it a lot better and without as much detail lost as photoshop would incur.)

EDIT: Got back to my computer, [here](https://i.imgur.com/flHpNno.jpg) is the upscaled image. 




 It is a parody of the racing scenes from the anime *Initial D*. 




 What about powerline ethernet adapters? That is data going across power lines! 




 Apparently it did happen. 




 How about on the backs of hippos? 




 There is always /r/trueanime but that is a smaller community. 




 Pac-Man was also in the Mario Kart arcade games. 




 It will be interesting to see how this compares to *Ballroom e Youkoso* in the portrayal of dancing. BeY is such that even I, who isn't even athletic at all, want to try ballroom dancing as it appears to be more than what most people think of it.


EDIT: Fixed tense of a word. 




 I'm not too surprised. Yeah, getting the rights to the lyrics would be a pain but musically it fits. 

It may cause the manga to become dated quicker but it is a great song choice. They used a song that is popular enough that people can remember bits and pieces from a few lyrics along with the swelling music in the climax.  




 As the question has inherent spoilers, could you please mark the text in your post accordingly? 




 I managed to find a copy of the Final Fantasy: Anthology for PS1 today at a local store but much to my detriment, FFV seems to crash 50-75% of the time when saving which will make it difficult or impossible to progress.

What can I do to fix it? I've tried turning off smoothing and such to no avail.

I was able to save once, but other than that it will always go to a black screen when saving. 

---

If there isn't a fix, I guess I could hook my up my old PS2 and play it that way. My concern is that with how most TVs are forgoing the composite/component connectors it would be a stop gap for about a decade or so and the FF series is something I'd like to keep around for longer than that. 




 It can't hurt to ask as the most they would say is no, especially with the amount of time that you had put in on the game. 




 Quoting /u/koredozo's above comment.

 Per one of the tweet replies: "There's a vendor you can buy gear from named Monst3r. There's about a 1/500 chance Ryan appears instead" 




 I think a mod commented in a thread last week that they remove any top-level comments that are less than 100 characters as they are normally low quality. 




 The lighting on the second to last photo is phenomenal as it gives an entirely different tone/look to the figure . 




 I'm surprised that they didn't get the rights to have the original song in there. Heck, it is on Disc 2 of the GuP OST as well so I'd think that getting the rights to the OST would cover it. 




 I think that max score was cheated anyways since all of the closest ones are half that. 




 It could be the reddit hug of death as people are going on to upscale/denoise their images. 




 I didn't have it do an upscale, just a denoise on an image and it dealt really well with the gradients in the background and the details though some information is lost. Then again, this is zoomed in at about 300% actual size so it is negligible.

[Left is before, right is after](https://i.imgur.com/KkY7FXI.jpg) 




 It wasn't hard to do. All I did was utilize a machine learning program that someone created with the purpose of upscaling anime/manga related images (such as fanart and what not) and it does it really really well. 




 [Here is a less blurry one at 1080x1920](https://i.imgur.com/Z4kLAhD.png). I used the waifu2x site to upscale the original and then used gimp and increased the canvas size. 




 [Here](https://i.imgur.com/lzi3td5.jpg) is a larger version than the 1080p one if you'd like. 




 So basically you want us to sign up using the only link which is a referral link so that we are now the suckers who are trying to make money/games from this and all you do is sit back and profit from it.

Yeah, no. 




 It is a car without the obvious police livery/decals, but it still sports the obvious things such as a spotlight, multiple radio antennas, bar lights (those there are normally inside the car) and so on. 




 [Here you go.](https://i.imgur.com/cjEsPVR.png) I utilized a deep convolutional neural network that was trained over 3000+ anime/manga related images to resize the original and then used GIMP to get the finalized image size since the program could only do 1.6 or 2x the original resolution.

 You need to save the page, for some reason you can't directly save it. Try doing File - Save Page As. 




 It is also really good at removing jpeg noise from an image. This will make some of my .jpg wallpapers usable since I won't see as much, if any, of the artifacting. Case in point, [left is before, right is after](https://i.imgur.com/KkY7FXI.jpg). 




 Yep, CUDA is Nvidia graphics cards only. 




 It seems as though he fed a natural learning program that is designed to read and produce images a few thousand anime related images to learn from. From that it seems to recreate the image rather than simply touching it up.

Case in point, it removed a lot of noise from a pretty complex wallpaper that I had. [Left is before, Right is after](https://imgur.com/KkY7FXI) 




 Could you please mark the spoilers? 




 Clannad and subsequently Clannad ~After Story~, heck a certain scene in After Story initiated a bout of depression the lasted for about three months. 




 She shows up in one of the earlier chapters of the manga so if it shows anything from the brother's work then we might. 




 FFXIV has a two week trial and it allows you to do most things up until level 20. 

The one cool thing about this is that one character can be all of the classes and spec differently so you could, given enough time, get a number of classes up to level 20 including the crafting classes! 




 What server are you on? I'm about to resub and if you are Zalarea, I can introduce you to my old FC and add you to the LS that the FC and some others use that is pretty active. 




 Do you know when the OST will be out? 

Also, I wish I knew what the opera-esque song in the beginning was. 




 The hard part about LovePlus is that it was never, officially, brought over to the US and it is put away as a niche within the niche of visual novels. 

It is only available in English through a patch that someone put out years ago. 

You may want to look at the visual novel community as a whole as it is starting to gain ground in the western markets.

Some examples: 

* [The release of the first Grisaia game on Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/345610/)

* [The crowdfunding initiative to bring over Clannad in English.](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sekaiproject/clannad-official-english-release/description)

* Popularity of indie game such as "Long Live the Queen" or the reception of the free visual novel, "Katawa Shoujo". 




 If you haven't seen it yet, I feel this way about Kekkai Sensen. I hadn't paid much attention to it, but I tried the first episode and then proceeded to binge watch what is out so far. 




 You had the wrong flair.

You had: Identification X

You need: Identification [Checkmark]

I have changed it accordingly, but please remember that when your identification request is fulfilled that you change it to the checkmark one.
 




 I would say it is a reference. There were magazines with some characters from "Shuffle!" on it in the original series' first season, so it wouldn't be the first time that the Haruhi has brought in things from other anime. 




 Good luck, there are a number of choices in the first ten minutes or so. 




 You can fix that by using http://azure.kdays.cn/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/AlphaROMdiE-Build20140214.rar and dragging the sigilusengine.exe onto the open program. Then use the shortcut that the program creates to play it. 




 When you cook/heat alcoholic drinks, the alcohol burns off. This is why people don't have to be carded when buying beer battered onion rings or other things that have used alcohol to add flavor. 




  I don't know what to call this face but I absolutely love it.

It kinda reminds me of how the [Chitoge nendoroid](http://images.goodsmile.info/cgm/images/product/20140430/4410/28872/large/fbc4d3d6499715db6291711189f2337d.jpg) looks. 




 Whoever posted the album added the two images after I had posted my tl;dr. Odds are they did it to be funny as the story made it seem as though they let all of the deer go without harm. 




 I have no idea as I have yet to play them, I would just know because /r/visualnovels would have gone crazy over the announcement. 




 I hope that when/if Clannad sells well on Steam that key looks into having you guys bring over *Angel Beats ~1^st Beat~*. 




 It gets worse, they have been injecting their own websites as well. For the past few weeks, I have been redirected to "activate" my already working internet multiple times. They'll even go so far to replace portions of pages with the activation webpage that does nothing other than interrupt my browsing at random.

The internet is, and has been, paid for month after month with Comcast since 2004-ish when they bought out Alephia.  




 I had read the whole thing, but I summarized based upon what I could remember. There was a lot in there about the tendencies and bahaviors of wild animals and they would choose the lesser of two evils, to which they gave an example of how a seal jumped on a boat to avoid a whale.  




 Deer swam, went too far, got cold, went towards boat, guy on boat lassoed the deer, deer got on boat and brought back to shore. 




 Not that I know of. I think Mangagamer has only licensed the Higurashi series.

If you can find the games online the fan translation is, reportedly, good and the creator of the game approved of the group so much that he used their name in one of the later chapters of the Umineko series. 




 I would but two things:

1. I am double bass, if I was a first Tenor I could (maybe) pull it off, but my voice range is from G1 to (on a good day) a G4 while LISA's voice is much higher than that.

2. My Japanese is horrible

 




 Yeah, I figured it would catch someone but I couldn't figure out a better way to word it but still have the title short enough to not be a full sentence. 




 It almost seems as though the vehicle had too much control and it didn't seem as floaty as Wipeout. (This is why wipeout had the airbreaks as they were used to finesse the vehicle to do tight turns at much faster speeds than normally possible.) 




 The hard part about recreating songs in minecraft is the combination of the fixed tempo (2.5, 5, or 10 ticks/s) and the really small scale that the noteblocks provide. It difficult to find something that sounds good within the confines of what the game provides. 









 For those of you interested in buying and playing the VN, it releases on the 15th on Steam!

EDIT: [Here is the link to the Steam page.](http://store.steampowered.com/app/310360/) 




 Gotta go fast 




  "It's Midori! (_)"

Fixed that for you. 




 Probably, but it kinda looks like an emoticon version of Sapphire. 




 Go post in /r/tsunderesharks, you will have a field day of karma. 




 Actually when it comes to standardization of weights everything is metric as a pound is described as a portion of a kilogram. (I don't remember the exact number off the top of my head) 




 But you did remember him, hence your post. 




 He did. 




 The August curse strikes again. Heck, Yoake Mae is completely translated and edited but the guy behind it has stalled it until he feels like completing it. :( 




 Top one as I would know what would happen as there is a [manga about this exact thing.](http://myanimelist.net/manga/16304/Gacha_Gacha_-_Secret) 




 [This one.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKRnEOUxZm0) 




 It is a reference to a scene in Jurassic Park. 




 You may say that last part, but your story says otherwise. What you did was, basically, money laundering where in a criminal sends money around to put it "through the wash" so the dirty money isn't as "dirty".

Odds are you won't be able to rescind this and you may lose your account. (I think the only time Valve fixes this is when/if your account is hacked and then used for those purposes but this is not the case for you.) 




 The reason for this is that the camera's shutter is/was synced to the helicopter's blades rotating making it appear as though the blades are not moving as it is taking the frame at the same time every time. 




 Sorry, I just knew that it was legal to listen to a preview of a song on iTunes and I knew the anime OST was on there for people to buy so I linked to it. 




 I haven't been able to play the trial but odds are it is track #8 on the OST. (My Most Precious Treasure) 

If you can, could you listen to the sample of the track on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/tvanimeshon-angel-beats!-original/id842476044) to see if it is or not? (Otherwise I'll have to watch out for the OST from the game as I want it if that is the case)

^ It is on the US iTunes. 




 It isn't the full episode. /r/anime has allowed people to share scenes in the comments and as links before without issue.  




 No reason to be sorry!  




 Auld Lang Syne.

When I went to Japan, pretty much every business, as it was closing, would play this over the speakers and it was a nice way of getting people to head out for the night. 




 I hate the bad rap those people have been giving Celiacs as they have an actual reason to be gluten-free. 




 You were using the wrong flair: 

You had: [Identification X]

You needed: [Request]

You were asking for something similar to ____ therefore it is a request. 

I have changed it accordingly, but please remember to flair correctly in the future. 




 **Issue:** Steam will constantly put current downloads into a queue rather than just downloading them.

I've never set up scheduling on Steam but every minute or so Steam will put a currently downloading game/update into a queue. It is getting to the point of being really really annoying.

Heck, within the time of typing this out I've had to restart the download for Tera three or four times. (I've lost count) 




 I don't think there is a translation of the **novel** it is based on. (Yet)

Invariably someone will do it as Hyouka has been translated that was also an actual novel. 




 Your description is wrong, they do not pay you for messaging your friends but for receiving ads. The advertisers, or those sending you unsolicited messages, have to pay "gems" which the user receives and they can then turn it into digital currency. 




 there doesn't seem to be

anything here 




 Have you read Ender's Game and subsequently Speaker for the Dead?  




 How about where the company allocates X% of the profits of the month from that game to modders and then the modders get a percentage of the allocated amount based on the number of views divided over the total views?

In short form:

((Your mod's views)/(Total Mod Views))*(X% of profit or funds allocated to modders)



 




 They are there to lessen the chance of bright flashes of light causing seizures in those watching it. The BD/DVD releases don't have to have this filter. 




 Sorry, it is a long title which would make it seem wordy. The full title is, MuvLuv Alternative: Total Eclipse. 

I just figured that those who didn't recognize MLA would avoid clicking on it. 




 If you hug the walls you can make it to Mor Dhona around level 25. 




 It is often said, but the best soundtrack is one that you don't notice but gives weight and meaning beyond that of just the voices and sound effects. A great example of this would be Han Zimmer's work in the movie, *Interstellar*. 




 I was watching episode 7 of MuvLuv Alternative: Total Eclipse and in one of the latter scenes the Lieutenant has a bath robe on but it is being worn [*right over left*](https://i.imgur.com/fsOmr8j.jpg).

I didn't know, or pay attention to this, but in Japan all robes whether they are kimonos, yutakas, bath robes, etc are all supposed to be worn *left over right* as the reverse is only used in funerals. This is so ingrained in the culture that during my class trip last year to Japan during the initial orientation about the yutaka and such they specified strict adherence to this.

You'd think with her being a stickler, in the same episode, about being Japanese that she'd keep to the conventions over her own culture.

Does anyone have an explanation for this or was it just a minor detail that an animator got wrong and it failed to be corrected for the blurays?
