 I dont always hit a women, but when I do I make sure I knock her to the floor no questions asked 




 Looks like a classy establishment y'all stayed at.. 




 I like how it says, "Our Goal, Totally Satisfied" because when I get my car towed that is the complete opposite of what I am.. 




 GOJO in the bottom right corner...they know whats really going on.. 




 I bet they all rode their fixies there, and then smoked cigarettes. 




 Its funny to me that this person decided to take a picture at this moment. 




 and what was nailed now?

 It's Arizona to start..
 









 God Bless New York City! 









 Thats how I look when Im standing next to my friends 














 well I appreciate you keeping me busy while I wait to do my rounds, but now I must go do them so I have to be on my way, but I am sure we will run into each other again on this here internet thing! 




 i wouldnt say people dont know what they want in life but it is more of a "how do i get there" problem, in my opinion 




 thats why you always gotta have your other shit to keep you sane, trust me if I just had this job, id kill myself bc overnights suck balls. But I know that this is just a paycheck for me and the real fun happens once I get off! its all a matter of tolerance 




 oh well yea man ride the college train as long as you can, no point in fucking up school for minimum wage anyway. Everyone says find a job you love and get paid for it, but thats kind of bullshit in my mind. Find a job to survive and do the things you love because you love them, even if it doesnt pay.. 




 living the dream my friend, getting paid to troll haha...you are my age, why cant you find work? 




 to kill time during my overnight shift..ah win!

 naw... 




 This will destroy you rocks faces off! EITS and Mogwai both get my blood pumping! Old Yndi Halda is good stuff too! 
























 Hahaha we meet again my good friend! 




 To that i would say we are not trying to go for that wow factor all the time as we would like to see our music be used for things such as movies, commercials, sports films..etc so we like to leave space in the music and without a singer we understand that there isnt always something there that will grab and hold the occasional post rock listener, but that is ok for us. The songs have their moments that grab you and thats all we want, the rest is up to you :) 




 Hahaha thanks, someone at the bar the other night made the same comment and I had to google it to see bc I couldnt remember..good call tho  




 We are putting it out there ourselves with the intent of it being used for film and/or commercial work so we would like to make the money that way and not by way of sales, so with that said we will not be selling it but making it available online for free download to anyone who asks..but with any luck the album should be done by then end of this year or the very beginning of next..it comes down to how quick i can mix it all hahaha..keep an ear out tho and facebook is how we keep everyone updated so check that periodically too :) thanks again tho and good ear on the semi circle comment! 




 Thanks soooo much brotha!! I appreciate that!! 




 They are live recordings ;) and nice call on the semi-circle...did u see the video? 




 Thanks soo much man! I really appreciate you taking a listen to the music and i am happy you enjoi it! Pass it along and if youd like the link to the online free download let me know and keep an ear out for the full length cd that should be coming out sometime before the new year :) facebook of course too blah blah blah

 I live in San Diego, Ca 



















 I totally understand the whole money thing...studios tend to take advantage of pple who are new to the recording game and to be honest you could have gotten the same sound prolly for free from some recording arts student who is looking for bands to track...i recorded some awesome bands while i was in school using that method and you would be surprised how much cooler pple are when there is no money involved! Im a 26yr old audio engineer with some good vision. Id love to mix your track if you have the ability to get the session file or at least the individual tracks. I do alot of mixing at my studio at home and would love to toy around with some different stuff if youre into it. Not looking to get paid, bt if the mix comes out well, id love to be able to use it on my audio resume...let me know what you are thinking and also with your vocals being out of key, that is a relatively easy fix for me with some of the programs i use...let me know..message me back on here and we can figure it all out! My name is alex btw 




 I have not no..but I will definitely check them out now! You a fan? 




 San Diego post rock. www.soundcloud.com/thievesoftheamericandream

 




 My post rock band just finished our first EP. Take a listen and let me know what you think! Thanks everyone and enjoy!

www.soundcloud.com/thievesoftheamericandream 




 hey man! glad that you got a recording done in a studio! Such a good feeling! its a good track, but it sounds like the guitars are really compressed hard, especially during the distortion parts..it sounds like it is just slammed and really sucks the life out of the guitar tracks...the vocals are also very very in front of the mix, which i guess is good in some instances but it could prolly be mixed back a bit because the singer tends to stress some of his vocals at times. other than that it sounds good and keep rocking! 
























 This is not wtf material... :( 




 beth? 




 That is an awesome painting! I want that for my album artwork for the band! 




 Keep doing your thing Nate! Looks great and can only get better from here! Interested at all in doing some album artwork!? 














 This is old news...
 



















 Ahhhhhhhh the cuddle fish, I'm sooo sawee Kyle! 




 Unfortunately tho bro..justin machado took that photo of me yesterday and i went out with him and 4 other close friends as his family is good family friends from high school bc he was my teacher...so i was with someone who knows what they are doing and was giving me great advice... the broken board was my own doing...ive grown up around surfing, seen it everyday in the water while i was on a sponge and have been in the water probably more in my life than on land... so i am not charging out on big waves not knowing what i am doing...i am riding waist high white wash trying to understand the feeling and mechanics of the board under my feet before taking it to an area full of surfers...being a sponger i know how surfers view someone who doesnt know what they are doing so i am not being irresponsible by just charging out like it is no thing...having lost people to the water, i understand it is not something to be taken lightly so please do not assume you know how I am approaching this because everything I do is always very calculated..

And stop using the word Kook, its unbecoming...  




 Hah oh yess know god speed for sure just never seen it written like that :)
 




 No need to buy we will send you a copy for free :) 




 No need to buy we will send you a copy for free :) 




 Yea it is all instrumental music! We want to leave it up to the listener to make what they want of it :) 




 Hahaha ur right bro. What was I thinking...And learning on white wash u are right, Im so in your way and complete nuisance. It's all good, i don't set foot in PB, so you can claim that for yourself..I'll take a break at wind n sea, table tops, boneyards, hell even beacons or any other break in NC over PB any day so that's all yours man..

If your worried about a "kook" stealing ur wave, don't trip. I have lived here my whole life and have been in the water for most of it just not surfing, so I know my etiquette. But I will say out of everyone I've talked to about this learning experience, you sir have been the biggest Richard of them all, so I say good day to you 




 If you think I'm a hipster with the pbr comment...you are way way off base my friend...i forgot tho that you came out of your moms vagina on a Steve Lis and never were a kook...I hope you never try something new again so you can always stay in top of your game bro..  




 Thanks brotha! I appreciate that! Take a look at the videos online and check facebook from time to time for when the album is going to come out! We are going to make it available for download for free to anyone who wants it :) thanks again man! 




 Its actually a handle bar mustache bt its hard to tell from the picture..freddie didnt have a handle bar mustache ... :/ 




 A female singer definitely would add something interesting to the music! Maybe some background harmony stuff during the heavy parts would be cool! Thanks for taking a listen, glad u like it :) 




 Thank you soo much :) it is very heart warming to have all this support..we really hope that once the album is done we can give it to enough people where it can just start to spread around to anyone who enjoys good music and we feel that with not having vocals we appeal to a more global audience while still maintaining a humbling sound :) glad you like it tho and I am always happy to talk music with anyone! Be on the look out for the new album coming soon, check the website periodically and facebook too :) thanks again! 




 I appreciate that. I am sure the other guys would feel the same way if they were here right now. We try to leave a lot up to the listener and allow them to really make what they want of it. The parts that grab you are intended to do exactly that and the rest is up to the listener :) be on the look out for the new album. Once its done I will put it online for free download to anyone who wants it. I will probably put a post on reddit for it :) 




 Hey thanks sooo much for taking a listen and glad u like! We actually take alot of our inspiration from the bands mogwai, russian circles, minus the bear, explosions in the sky, Sigur Ros, older Yndi Halda...a lot of post rock thats for sure but to be honest, I am unfamiliar with the band you mentioned but i am going to look them up as soon as I can! Thanks again, it means a lot! 




 Yea but i still get more pussy than you ;) 




 Yeeaaahhhh boooyyyyy 




 Ob logic! I was surfing at river mouth in del mar today when this shit happened! Ima need to find another board to get on...my friend is planning a trip to south america next june so i said i would learn to surf for when we went so I gotta do this haha 




 U should play clue bc u nailed it bro 




 haderp! 




 Thanks you sooo much! It is awesome to hear someone say that! We really put in the effort to make our music an experience! Im glad you appreciate the different song feels we put out there for you to listen to! We are trying to do everything that you just conveyed in your last comment so thank you :)  
























 God damnit.. 




 Wow..yes, yes you did.
 




 Idk what in-n-out you went to but there is always at least a 15min wait for food because it is so packed..in any of them..the fries are not too great I will give you that, but the burgers are phenomenal! Not to mention not nearly as pricey as five guys either..meat and cheese baby, meat and cheese :) but I enjoy five guys as well. 









 wait til you try in-n-out burgers..only if you come to the west side of the states tho.. 




 bahahaha 









 What is your best pickup line and did it work? 





























 Wait, yea, just checked this guy out....this is total bullshit..he's been posting stuff for the last couple months about work and his "place"...I smell a Karma whore 




 Hope you have a job.. 




 I would sure hope after only 10 years you could..otherwise you would be a sparkling example of the divorce statistic in this country 
























 So basically you are telling everyone that you have it too... 




 Original, like ur style.. 









 looks like you have a real winner there. I feel a karma whore coming on, right about now.. 









 if you like post rock music, then take a listen to our new song [Surface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqRimKa322I) 




 Take a listen to a post rock instrumental band from San Diego called [Thieves of the American Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqRimKa322I) they are very powerful and cinematic, much like Sigur Ros..hope this helps :) 




 Giant panda, Soul position, DJ Alibi, Ugly Duckling, Aesop Rock, Deltron 3030, Hieroglyphics, Souls of Mischief, Kool Keith, Atmosphere, Brother Ali, Eyedea and Abilities, Felt, Living Legends, MC Paul Barman 




 there is a post rock band called Thieves of the American Dream who do all instrumental music..very cinematic pieces, its been used in documentaries and commercials.. [thieves of the american dream](http://www.reverbnation.com/thievesoftheamericandream) 




 Atmosphere, MC Paul Barmen, Giant Panda, DJ Alibi 




 damn...rip eyedea 









 When you say wooshy, in what regard? Are you referring to the overheads of the drums or the guitars? 




 Very cool man! Well if you very get stuck on a mix for a band, let me know I'd love to help out where I can. Keep up the good work and advice! 




 Ok I appreciate that! I am opening up my DAW as we speak! 




 Do you do any work with bands or is it mainly production stuff? 




 Very cool man! What r unrunning in your studio if you don't mind me ask 




 Definitely do! Sounds like you know what you want to do with it! Keep up the good work! 




 Oh heck ya man, i have been reading through the past threads and I appreciate you giving quality advice and feedback to people. It's important for people to pass along the knowledge! 




 Thank you, ya sometimes it is hard to find that balance. With this genre of music there tends to be a lot of repetitiousness and so we try not to do too much of it because without lyrics it can start to get monotonous. Thank you for the feed back tho! Take a listen to our newest song, it is our Frankenstein song with some post rock, math rock and post hardcore influence [Caterpillar Harvest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BIdyxmSiV0) 




 I hear ya, I often hear tracks getting too muddy because of side chains on everything at certain points to make changes more prominent and that bugs the hell out of me. The track sounds great tho man! Crisp and clear  




 The structure of the song is good and the lyrical content is there, but as at as the mix goes there are a couple things that could be done. I am glad to see you are a fellow logic user tho :) the vocals sound like they could be compressed a little more, just to smooth them out and sit them in the mix a little nicer. The snare also seems to have a bit of a long tail on the reverb when it is hit, or it could be the natural decay of the snare, but either way tightening up a gate a little on it might make it sound a little less muddy..but then again sometimes that's nice to have. 




 I appreciate that! Did you listen to it in headphones by chance...the stereo image of this song is actually quite big :) now I need to zone out and listen to it again and again haha 




 Hahaha rad man! I am a rock musician too bt do hip hop stuff on the side so I appreciate where you are coming from and putting this out there! You sound a bit like [MC Paul Barman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC_Paul_Barman) and [Atmosphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_(music_group) the lyrics are good with a good sense of timing about them. Te beat is pretty good too just needs to have the drums drop in a little harder! I'd love to put some drums to this track! Nicely done, hope to hear more! 




 This track sounds real good! The drops are solid and the build ups are nice and fluid..I get a little bit of some weird phantom frequencies around the 2-3k range but I am also listening with Grado's and they hear everything too well haha... Maybe try side chaining an low end oscillator to your kick on the drops to give it a little more DROP.. The track is awesome tho man, quite the listening experience! 




 I like the track very different sounding..the only thing I would say is with the way that the vocals are mixed, very light and airy with tons of reverb, I almost wanted to hear some solid drums in the track, at least something at would drop at some point, just to give the track some continuity...nothing to crazy but a simple electronic beat or a minimal DnB beat would suffice, just because it feels as tho that would keep the interest of the listener a little more, but that's just IMHO. Keep up the good work! 




 Just listened to the song and I really like the guitar work..it is busy bt not overwhelming which is what I like... I think if you were to find the right drummer for it to keep it busy and interesting bt at the same time able to come back to a solid rhythm, I think the song could have a real math/indie rock feel to it...I am a drummer and would love to record something to it for fun! I will definitely be jamming to it later either way! 




 [Surface](http://www.reverbnation.com/thievesoftheamericandream/song/17276298-surface)


Hello fellow music makers! I am pretty much finished with a mix I did for my post rock instrumental band. The song is called Surface. Take a listen and any feedback and/or criticism is always welcome and encouraged! Hope you enjoy! (If you have headphones, I'd put them on now)

 Hey man! Just listened to the song and it has a nice feel when it first comes into the verse bt then it starts to get a little repetitious..maybe break it up with some sort of change in the song..an effect or chorus or something because the verse feels a bit too long :)  




 The EP sounds great man, there is a lot of room in there for some samples that might be a nice compliment to the song.. Very good sounding and the vocalist has good dynamic! Sounds like a good project to be a part of! Good luck! 



















 I didnt even see the dude on the floor till he started spazing out hahaha 


































 ahhh, now the context is all making sense! It is way too early for all this.

 You own the mineral rights to those 20 acres and can build non permanent structures on it with a non concrete foundation and so long as you can tear it down with no evidence that it was ever there, you can build whatever u want...for the most part...

 Well, in spirit ;) 




 Already ran into him.. 









 You are correct..we are hoping it is signs of a pocket near by..exposing bedrock with lots of virgin gravels on top..looks good so far :) 




 Maybe $25... 









 no music up anywhere yet tho :( 




 so if you look at the maker of the toy set, it is the same name as who apparently left the ransom note for the family...oh man, gotta love photoshop! 




 as a drummer who has played many shows in the past, DO NOT PLAY YOUR HARDEST SONG first.... that is horrible advice! Play the song that you and your band feel will keep people's attention and make them wanting more, that way you can get the audience into your music and band and if you fuck up down the line, chances are no one will notice. As opposed to playing your hardest song first (which to the average listener, they wont be able to tell) and possibly fucking it up and having that be the thing people remember because it was your first song. 

In the end, put together a set that will keep people interested, and that doesnt necessarily mean playing your hardest song first.

Bring lots of sticks and keep a rag near by for those sweaty palms because with it being your first gig, no matter how calm and collected you are, you gunna get the nervous sweats

Make friends with the front of house engineer too, he ultimately holds the fate of your band for that club in his hands....saying hello and offering to help with any kind of stage set up really does go a long way.

bring lots of sticks and dont drink too much before the stage, being drunk at your own gig is over played

AND REMEMBER, have as much fucking fun as possible and keep telling yourself this is why we all got into gigging in the first place! 

Good luck brotha! Whats the name of your band?

 Does it play!!?? 




 Do get it, God damnit! 




 Fuck cats 




 And shit  




 Fuck Cats 




 This is fucking stupid... I smell complete bullshit..  "Defying everything that once stood in our way" Bahahahaha just fuck either already! 




 Fuck cats 




 Only on reddit will a gif like this turn into an English argument.. But I learned something today 




 The comments were at 666, so I had to change that  




 And this is how it starts 




 Cats are fucking stupid 









 The dog.. 




 It's my town of Truckee, Ca.. Lake Tahoe area  



















 Just don't drink and drive. It's simple. And anyone who says it's not that easy is making excuses for themselves  




 Yes, yes I do 




 Oh man, hotline Miami.. Great game  









 So first of faggot, he has been going to that lady for over 35 years.. Secondly, if barbershops weren't full of pretentious douche bags like yourself, maybe I would have considered it. 




 The shock of having a gay grandson too much for him? 




 Get the fuck outta here if u don't care  




 Unfortunately tho it's not just two guys getting a haircut, it's my grandfather who turned 90 which is a pretty big milestone, you twat 




 Bc u won't make it to 90  




 I hope a snapping turtle rips off ur cock 




 Thanks for all the birthday wishes for my grandfather! I am going to show him and try to explain what reddit is to him.. 




 I will tell him!! 




 Thanks so much!! 




 Thank you kindly! 




 Well do brother, hope work is going well! 




 My grandfather has been getting his hair cut from the same lady for over 35yrs which is why we went there :) 









 Yep. 





























 Fuck cats 





























 Regular musician here, see back room castings.. 




 Burning man is not that great unless ur a huge hippy.. Otherwise it's a dirty dusty place with tons of fucked up pple in a relatively small space thinking they are more artsy than the next person... In the end, the burning man event does more damage to the surrounding land than anything else despite everyone being "Eco" friendly.. 














 Absolutely gorgeous, I keep going back to your pics.. :) 














 Getting some friends together tmrw and buying some cards to send off!! 




 Lucky workout equip! 




 Do it! If nothing else it's fun to get out there and at least look.. Equipment can be expensive however, and we work somewhere where we are able to get a lot of scrap metal and other pieces and make a lot of what we have ourselves..bt we have a high banker, single level sluice box, tons of hoses to gravity feed water, lots of buckets and wash bins, classifiers shovels and rock picks 




 The paper process is quite involved and there are a few ways of going about it. You can stake a claim on lands that the BLM have allowed for mineral harvesting. But you would need to check with the  LR2000 to make sure it's not already claimed and that is a whole process in itself! Talk to your county's mineralogist  and possibly visit the BLM offices, they will help you as much as they can..at least they did for us here in CA... 

You can also buy claims from people who are selling then but they tend to be a little more expensive but at least that way you are paying for the paperwork being done and just a transfer in title is all that is needed at that point and then putting up the proper signs on your claim.. 
























 Yes because every black male is approached like that by the police..gtfoh 




 And I am no psychologist, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn last night 




 It's not that they don't fight back.. Most of these videos are propaganda videos to help support their specific faction, so having a video of someone struggling and fighting back doesn't really give the whole "we submit" kind of feel that these videos tend to have.. 




 Thank you so much for answering my questions. I am going on as a sound tech. 

My one question to you is, did you enjoy your experience working for RC as a sound tech? 




 Amen 




 All I could really think about was that I didn't want to die on the floor and that it was cold down there. I didn't want to die in the cold 




 Thanks will do 




 Half pound for $450... I live in northern Cali and have never heard of a deal like that.. 




 When you think about things like this happening to you, you always think you would save the day and knock the gun out of his hands, blah blah blah. Bt that shit went out the window real quick and I just stayed on the ground hoping it would be over quickly  




 I am leaving on a 6mo contract next month with Royal Caribbean as an audio tech/stage hand and I still have some questions but the company is being quite vague with me. Here are some questions I have and feel free to let me know how your overall experience was as well! Thanks!
My 5 Questions:

I am a drummer and would not enjoy not being able to play for 6mo. Is there a staff lounge with say a piano and drum kit you can play?

How easy is it really to change rooms if you don't get along with your roommate?

How are the hours of work? I have heard many different things, anywhere from 12+hrs all week to some days are 12hr days and some are 2hr days.

Can you fast track yourself to a higher up position during your first contract? Can you do it at all?

Are you allowed off the ship when in port if there is no work to be had?

Thanks everyone! I look forward to some responses! It will help me out greatly :)

 Exactly man 




 It's hard for me to call it a good thing. Would I have rather it didn't happen, yes. But am I glad now that it did.. It's hard to say.. I'm justthankful I was able to take something positive away from such a shitty experience... And didn't get shot 




 He got away with around $450 so I'll let you make that call 




 No they have not yet, no real leads I know of either 




 I honestly don't know if me having a gun would have made the situation better or worse. Trying to go for a gun when one is already drawn on you, unless you're a quick draw, I feel like it would do more harm than good.

I do not own a gun, have never fired a gun nor do I plan to purchase one for my own safety.. I don't feel like I live in an unsafe area even tho this happened to me. The police said it was the first armed robbery in over 10yrs to happen in the town so a freak incident. Altho I have been toying around with the idea of hunting for the last year or so..

After the robbery I was very hesitant to go back to work and my bosses actually wanted me to close the bar the very next day and I literally had to plea with then to give me the night off and they reluctantly did because I think they knew I would have just quit. I was able to talk to a counselor and therapist a couple times that the victims unit of my police department provided. I was having a hard time wrapping my head around the whole ordeal and why it had to happen to me and to a degree still am but I have kind of come to grips with the fact that it was a sign to start making moves in my life and have started to do just that. And yes, I still close the bar at night but am much more cautious and nervous when doing so, but I put my two weeks in tonight so not too much longer  




 My life did not flash before my eyes, however I truly think it happened for a reason because I am not doing what I am suppose to be doing with my life. So I actually got a new and much better job that I could consider a career and put my two weeks in tonight. So it definitely gave me a life kick in the ass. 

 He had hosiery or tights over his face so I could not really see his face bt I saw what he was wearing and could recognize the voice again if I ever heard it.. Something I doubt I will ever forget 




 Fuck man, ya sweet vengeance would be very very nice.. After our robbery there was a robbery in a near by city and then another in south Lake Tahoe, all robbed in a similar way as we were. I am really hoping the police can find him with the evidence they collected at the other robberies and then maybe get the chance to see him in court and help put him away..  That's really what I want  




 I cant say having a firearm on me would have made the situation any better but I don't know if it would have made it worse either. Can't say I feel like a victim for not having a firearm tho. But I do understand why you would say that.  




  I was about 90% sure I was going to die that night. He could have done it so easily and my co worker didn't give him all the money (although the robber didn't know that) bt if he did that would have been all the reason he needed to do me in. When I think back about it, there are so many things I wish I would have done, but in the moment there was no chance I would have actually done it. But it is interesting to look at the situation from a few different ways in my head. I will have to check out that book tho, sounds interesting to me, especially now  




 My coworker only gave him the money out of 1 of the 2 draws we have and he didn't get our deposit for the night so only about $450 




 No fear boner, would have hurt anyway bc I was face down on a tile floor haha.. I have never shot a gun and have mixed feeling on carrying a concealed weapon.. I am not some hippy liberal guy that thinks we should all hold hands bt at the same time I don't know if having a gun on me would have made the situation better or worse..bt having an open carry might have meant that he would have seen my gun and maybe not done what he did, but who knows  




 Thank you, and it was actually kind of hard to bring myself to go back.. I am not the kind of person who has things really bother me after the fact, bt this shook me up and I didn't really want to go back to work right away. My bosses actually wanted me to close the next night which floored me and I literally had to plea with them to let me take the night off. Reluctantly they gave me the night off but it was like twisting their arm which kind of soured me on the establishment even more. I will say I am way more cautious/nervous closing now, but actually I put my two weeks tonight and got a new job. It's just too much of an uneasy feeling at my current job 




 When he told me not to move, and had the gun to my temple, I told him I wasn't going anywhere. That was all I really said to him.. I didn't really think to say anything to him to be honest, I really just wanted the whole thing to be over so talking to him may have just kept him there longer. 




 At first when I saw him come from the back I thought it was a joke until he came right next to me and put the gun in my face and put his hand on my shoulder and pushed me to my knees and then down on my stomach and told me to stay there. What's funny tho is I have thought in the past if something like this was to happen to me, I would totally just knock the gun out of his hand and tackle the dude and blah blah blah but when it happened, none of those thoughts came into my head. The robber said if I moved, or saw the cops or didn't get all the money he was going to spray my head all over the floor and even though he got everything he came there for, I was about 90% sure I was going to die that night because he could have done it so easy.. And the only thing that was honestly going through my head was I didn't want to die and that it was very cold on the floor and not a place I wanted to die. 









 I decided to take a hike with my dog and reflect on what happened and I can honestly say it was one of the most satisfying hikes I have taken in a very very long time. The sun seemed to shine a little brighter too 









 I am a male and yes he barked orders at me to get on the ground bt at first I thought it was some sort of joke bt once the gun was in my face, I figured wasn't and at that point I told him to take it easy as I was getting on the ground and when he told me not to move as the gun was on my head I told him I wasn't going anywhere, so I guess we talked.. 




 Hahaha no, we think he was just passing thru town bc we are off a major highway.. At least that's what the cops think  




 Well the short of it is, I was closing up at the bar I work at in my little Mtn town I live in around 12am on a Friday. Guy came out the back, drew a gun on me and made me get to the floor while my co worker emptied the register.. All the while having the gun pressed to my temple as I lay on the ground.. Ask me anything, I can give more details and nothing is off limits.


EDIT: here's the news report: http://www.mynews4.com/news/story/Truckee-Police-searching-for-robbery-suspect/Y78u1rO9xUyYUlYV5Gfb5g.cspx 




 Well fuck.. 









 What they wrote, that's what we do 









 Be a better pet owner u twat 




 I believe you are correct. The large fishing vessel that the video was shot from was being attacked by the people in the water. They were pirates and the main ship was in the right to defend themselves the way they did, however, the high fives seen on film by the crew is a little unnecessary bt I get it I guess..   














 If I am correct, it is the artist [Panca](http://vimeo.com/70903001)from Tijuana.. That video is a segment I worked on for a tv program called Art pulse tv which has since been discontinued. 




 .......are you suggesting cage the elephant is a hardcore punk band!? 









 No friend, fuck you 




 I love living here in Tahoe! Went to donner myself today! 









 Fuck cats

 Dat gap

 Both, small restaurant/craft beer bar

 You're an idiot. 




 You're and idiot.  




 Bahahaha... Next level hipster shit 




 Maybe 




 I'd like to see her in prison for a bit to think of the dumb shit she did 




 Can't find her on Facebook... Anyone else having luck with that?
