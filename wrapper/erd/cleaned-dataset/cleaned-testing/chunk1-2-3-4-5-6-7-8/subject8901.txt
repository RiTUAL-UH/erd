 I liked having a tall locker. The smaller ones were hard to get into if the dude below you was fucking around in theirs. I once had a small locker (a bottom one), and the person who had the locker above mine left a sandwich in theirs throughout the Christmas break. The smell of rotten salami and mayonnaise made its way into my locker and stayed there for the rest of the year. The few articles of clothing I left behind over the break smelled, my gym shoes smelled (and not like my sweaty feet), and worst of all my text books smelled. I had to throw out everything except the text books, because I couldn't just replace those --they were way too expensive. I used those text books for the rest of the year, even though they stunk up every classroom they entered.  
  
TL;DR - don't rent a small locker.

 On closer inspection (now that I'm on a computer and not my phone) I can say I'm almost certain that is not a fallstreak hole. What you have there looks like a small gap in a layer of stratocumulus cloud, which is actually pretty common. It could be because of the way the cloud is forming or dissipating, or it could just be that the clouds are moving in such a way as to form a gap. Fallstreak holes usually only occur in mid to high level convective clouds, such as altocumulus and cirrocumulus. 




 Yep, that's a fallstreak hole.

 I remember spending $2000 on a laptop with 70GB of space. That, to me, was amazing. The rate at which we're able to continue cramming more and more data onto continuously shrinking devices is mind-blowing indeed.

 Well, I can't say I was expecting a response like that. I'm torn between thanking you for shedding light on the subject and deriding you for being the worst kind of sexual degenerate.

 Not only will you improve your posture and appear taller, but you'll also strengthen your back and core. 




 Wow, that's pretty tall but this is the internet, so you could be lying and I will never find out. However, you have an honest sounding name. I'll believe you this time.

 Hey, everyone, look! It's the [guy from the Internet!](http://dilbert.com/strip/2015-06-07) 




 I spent years having to listen to ignorant, racist assholes tell stupid fucking jokes like this at work. Thankfully, I'm no longer working in an environment like that. I'm glad you lost your job, because if you're saying shit like this at work then you need to learn a fucking lesson.

Edit: A lot of the replies to this comment are absolutely abhorrent. I'm not sure if they're jokes or meant to be serious. Regardless, it's very disheartening to see so much racism in this thread. I know it's the Internet, but I expected more from reddit. I genuinely hope that despite whatever hateful things your parents taught you, you break the circle of ignorance by not passing down your racist attitudes to your children. They deserve better. The world deserves better. 




 I downvote every comment I see that is edited like yours, and I hope others do the same.

 Just because you did those things doesn't make you a bad person.

Keep fighting and maintain that courage and you'll have no reason to feel guilty. 




 If that's the worst that's ever happened to you, consider yourself lucky.

[Here's another interesting info graphic showing how much water is consumed during the lifecycle of a typical beef cow.] (http://static1.squarespace.com/static/53ddf6b0e4b0219ea2c8b53f/t/5486139ae4b08d78fd1dd863/1418072986569/) And this is the [source for that picture](http://www.swissbiofarmer.com/blog/). 




 Cows are the most land and water intensive livestock to raise. That's why people in many countries eat less beef and tend to eat more pork, goat, and other smaller farm animals that can be kept in smaller spaces. Also, people in other countries tend to eat a lot less of everything than the average North American.
