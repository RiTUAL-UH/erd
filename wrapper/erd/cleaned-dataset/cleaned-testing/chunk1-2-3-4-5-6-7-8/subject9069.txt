Since Poe is mentioned in it, I thought I'd add that I'd recently learned [Poe and Longfellow](http://books.google.com/books?id=4W1v0KXuEjYC pg=PA84 lpg=PA84 dq=poe+on+longfellow+plagiarism source=bl ots=a5cQH7b4YY sig=S6fRB4pGESmLK51qnBNlO_uhO5g hl=en sa=X ei=jYH2U7mQEIaeyATI4YL4Cg ved=0CC8Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage q=poe%20on%20longfellow%20plagiarism f=false) had a rivalry where they called each other plagiarists.

 A criticism I've seen lately of Philip K. Dick is that he had original premises and concepts but that his execution usually feel short of his ambitions. While obviously that's mostly a matter of opinion, it made me curious who serves the opposite function. Who's a writer who took cliche ideas and characters but had prose that made up for it?

 Sure, but he deserted the cause.  




 I guess it made him paranoid that someone's trying to make people walruses and made this film as a warning.  




 Is this the cover for that book?  




 Two weeks. I was camping, I hated everyone there and my body. I didn't even change my pants for one week. I don't know how well the fact I was a twelve year-old boy scout works as an excuse.  









 In your surgery experience, have you had any truly horrible experiences of the types we have a few well-known examples of on Reddit?

 My point was that there was nothing interesting about the character as written.  




 It kinda looks like a couple tuna melts. I take it that's some version of cottage cheese?  




 If he feels the need to share a picture of it and contextualize it in such a way, I don't know how it could more obviously be narcissism. 

That said, DAMN that looks like a good steak.

 I don't see what made Wendy Torrance as written for that movie a good character. She's hardly compelling on her own and I don't know what Duvall could have done to save it.   




 Coloration is a bit different between the two. Leave it to CNN to not white balance properly!

His passenger asks what he's doing now and the driver says "Well, my brother might be coming the other way!"

 I consider him even worse than that Fred channel from a few years ago, but every MLP Facebook group seems like it will have a post a day claiming his channel is great or some such. 

The overlap is incomprehensible. I'm sure someone will claim it's like being a fan of this show, but it's really not. It would be like if Pinkie Pie squealed incoherently for nine minutes out of every episode and the camerawork was swooshy and swirly and practically meant to be headache inducing. 

Edit: Judging by the feedback, it's not a Brony thing but a Facebook thing. Cool. Thanks for your time!

 There was a copy of one of the Swamp Thing comic books at my library. In it there's a page showing the many ways an evil force's power is supposed to be infecting and corrupting the world. One of the images in it was a couple little girls putting their kitten in the microwave and being just about to start it. 

Someone had taken a pen and just scribbled out that panel, but you could still see what was happening. It was the only panel they had done that for even though others featured people and other animals being murdered. I was bewildered that apparently someone out there was the kind of person who would react that way to the though of a kitten being killed but would still read overtly horrific comic books and get that far into it. 

I've also seen a few Stephen King books with pentagrams drawn in them, but that just seemed like kids messing around.

 I have to admit I'm more curious about how photo booths like this worked in the 1900s. Did you take the film out yourself and get it developed? Was there a full time photographer on hand? Would he or she have gotten in trouble for taking the picture?

 Last night I went on a walk through the local park. At one point there was a  clearing with a fawn on it. It sprinted away as I approached by the path took a turn so I started to walk away and it stopped when it became obvious I wasn't approach it. Then it started to gallop after me. I thought this was kind of weird so I just sort of yelled "Hey!" when it was only like two feet from me and it stopped. I looked past it and saw that its mother had showed up and was eyeing me. After staring at me walking away a few more seconds, and turned and galloped in another random direction. 

I certainly knew better than to touch a wild deer, but is it likely that fawn was going to do anything to me if I hadn't yelled something? Like, I don't know, bump into me or bite me or some territorial "playful" thing?

 I was going to make a fairly crude MLP game with 2d sprite graphics (hired out, I'm well aware of my limitations as an artist and a bit overpaid.) Which of these stories sounds like a more interesting game: 

A. Twilight and the others of the Mane Six experiment with a spell Twilight Sparkle found in the archives to make them "more their cutie marks." Instead of making them better at those things, they end up literally turning into those things (Applejack becomes a pony made of apple, Rarity becomes a crystal statue, etc.) Fortunately Twilight had a book of cures on hand if something went wrong. 

So the games are really minigames where you try to cure the ponies of their different states, with different levels of difficulty and different reactions from the ponies (i.e. Rainbow Dash could think it's awesome that she's a pony made of rainbow-colored lightning with a mane and tail of cloud and would try to avoid being cured.)  

B. The Princesses decide to let the changelings into Equestria under close supervision to bring about peace between the two cultures. The idea seems to be going as well as could be expected at first (like a few changelings can't help but try to pass themselves off as ponies, but they get rooted out quickly.) Then Queen Chrysalis of all ponies reports that there seems to be an epidemic of it happening that she can't control. It's up to the player to get to the bottom of whether the changelings are really innocent, under something else's control, if it can be made to work, etc. 

I'm loosely planning that it would be a matter of trivia games to sort out who's real and not and a point-and-click beyond that.

I know he was just a speechwriter for Nixon, but I thought possibly he would have been in a position to know something we don't about the situation. Or he was wildly nostalgic and expressing some hero worship. 

What's your opinion?

 



















 I have a novel with a pitch I have streamlined for easy submission, but I'm fairly new to professional writing and all my previous experience is nonfiction. Since the reality of the situation is that I'm selling myself along with the book pitch, is it better to show I have a following by having some short story publication credits or to show I have plenty of Facebook followers, Twitter followers, and so on?  












































 I developed a bad habit in middle school where if someone was busty and had a lot of cleavage on display, I would look off in some other direction or at some arbitrary other thing because otherwise I might stare. This might be a fairly rare reaction I have because I grew up often not looking at people's face when we were talking and neither did my brother, but if it's common, which is more annoying?   




 I had never hallucinated in my life before this. Ive rarely gone a night without sleep, Ive never had a recreational drug stronger than a cappuccino. Im not ill in anyway that Im aware of. The most severely Ive ever been medicated is when I got prescribed zoloft my freshman year at Pescadero High for about two weeks for mild obsessive compulsive disorder. Believe me, Ive gotten a second and third opinion from psychiatrists and neurologists and theres nothing wrong me. Nothing they can find, anyway. 

It was a night three weeks ago. The moon was full enough that places without any street or house lights were dark blue instead of pitch black except for in the shadows when I biked to Moms. I always biked to her place because it helped reinforce the impression that I was trying to get in shape. 

The layout between my Mothers place and my apartment is like this: her place, then down main street for a bit, then turn left into the dog park, up the big hill in the dog park, into the apartment complexes, through the smaller park, theres the post office, go along the beach path for a few hundred meters, then Im home.  

Everything was unusually pleasant as I started riding from the home and down main street. I remember that I checked for my cell phone only to find it wasnt there. I recalled then that Id left it to recharge in my kitchen then and felt dumb for not taking it with me to recharge at Moms.  

When I reached the dog park, I made my usual try at surmounting the hill, but as I said, Im not in shape and about a third of the way up I switched to walking the bicycle up its main trail on my route. That trail is surrounded by thick undergrowth and really pretty underlit, with just a single lamppost lighting it. Out of nowhere I heard growling in the undergrowth. I barely had time to look back and to my left to see a dog come sprinting onto the path. It was a German Sheperd breed and the most furious animal Ive ever seen. Its ears were flat and its fangs were bared and dripping, as if it was attacking out of hunger instead of just anger. It was on me in a second.   

I was extremely lucky and apparently the dog was extremely stupid. When it leapt up at me, it got caught on the bike that I had been walking. Its jaw snapped close enough to me that a gob of its saliva landed on my shirt but it didn't injure me. I was just barely able to keep the bike upright so it stayed. Before it had a chance to back up and try for me again, I heard someone yelling "No!" in a scolding tone. A huge guy, at least a foot taller than me, grabbed the dog by the collar and pulled it away. He still seemed to struggle for a few seconds but then the dog sat and just growled and snarled at me. 

As I processed what had just happened and then got a hold of myself, I saw that the man that had just gotten the dog under control was just staring at me. No look of worry that his dog had just attacked someone, no apologies, nothing but a blank stare at me as his dog growled between his legs. I waited a moment for him to say something or at least move. 

Control your goddam dog! I told him just to break the silence. He didnt respond, although his dog barked stood again and tried to charge at me, but the owner held it strong. I climbed back on the bike and strained my way up the hill, not wanting to look too weak to pedal the bike in front of the guy Id just yelled at. 

After something like that, I was on the lookout for stuff as I pedaled out of the dog park and into the apartment complexes. There was no one out walking but plenty of cars and trucks driving by. Everything felt normal, pleasant even, but of course I was still a bit shaken. I think I felt lucky for a few seconds there that I hadnt pissed my pants when the dog attacked.

As I pedalled past the first apartment building in the complex, I saw the first person Id seen just out walking that evening. It was a woman of roughly thirty with very deeply tanned skin and wearing one of those Islamic headscarves. Her eyes were very, very wide and her movements were unnaturally stiff. She looked at me as I approached her as if she thought I might be about to attack. 

Feeling both still a little paranoid but emasculated I stopped and dismounted. 

Maam, are you alright? I asked, thoughtlessly walking up to her, probably exactly wrong for approaching a scared person. 

Oh, yes yes! she insisted with a rapid nods while backing away from me, making a big phony smile. 

Are you sure? I said dully. 

Yeah. Im fine. Thank you for asking. As she said that, she began to walk forward again, giving me a wide berth. When she passed me she turned her head round to look at me, her smile gone and her eyes still wide. When she did, her eyes... they seemed to elongate across her face. Her left eye seemed to curve up and around her temple and her right extended down and around her cheek, both the whites of her eyes and the pupils and irises with them. I would have just thought I was misinterpreting what I was seeing, but when the left eye elongated up to her head scarf, it went under it instead of being superimposed over it as I would have thought in a hallucination, She paused as this happened, letting me have a good long look at what I thought I was seeing. Much longer than I would have wanted. Then she turned and continued her awkward walk, looking normal from the back. 

I didnt know what to do for a moment. Should I just run up and try to see her eyes again? As I said earlier, Id never hallucinated before. I felt lucid if extremely uneasy then. I decided to just keep going on my errand and then go home. I guess I wanted to continue thinking that it was an anomaly with my vision and that everything was normal. 

I started biking past the apartments. Despite my apparent desire to continue as if things were normal, I was looking all around me for something else out of the ordinary. This unfortunately caused me to look in some of the apartment windows. Most of them had their blinds or their curtains shut, but every once in awhile there was one I could see inside. As unpleasant as it might sound, I looked into each one I could as I rode by. 

I went by several open windows with nothing out of the ordinary happening in them, but something I think I saw in one window made me slow down. It was hard to describe, but I thought I saw two people that seemed to be standing back to back for some reason. But when I stopped and went back a little, I saw that the two were doing what looked like a regular dance of some kind, probably practice for some show. I dont know. I got going again, feeling like I was letting my wil imagination convince me to do some skeevy things. I tried to stop myself from looking into the next open window to give the whoever might be in there privacy. What I saw instead made me squeeze my brakes with a death grip. 

There was an old, heavy man sitting on a couch. I remember he was wearing a white undershirt. Other than that, all I had time to see was what he was doing: He was cutting his face with what looked from the way he was holding it like an exacto-blade. He would push it against his cheek, chin, nose, forehead, twitch his hand and leave a cut, then slowly move the knife to another part of his face for another cut. He was looking off to his left with a contented expression while he did this like someone watching television without any particular interest. 

I watched him do this for what felt like minutes on end but was probably less than half a minute. I remember twitching a couple times looking at this from how painful it looked. I have no recollection of having ever seen anything like that before. I was becoming sick to my stomach at the sight of his cuts and the blood dripping down his face and staining his undershirt. And I tried, but I couldnt convince myself I was hallucinating. 

Out of nowhere, he turned and looked at me. He glared and made to get up, his blade still in his hand. I imagined he had to be getting up to come after me. I must have unconsciously lowered my feet to the ground, but I tried to lift my feet to the pedals. In my desperation to get out of there, I missed the pedals. I looked down, this time, and got a trembling left foot on the pedal. I looked back at the window to see if he was coming for me. 

There was no sign of him. I hesitated for a second then. He might have been behind the door, about to get outside only a few steps from me. But I decided then that even if I was seeing things, I would need to call the police when I got home. Even if I was seeing something, there was a possibility there was in a man in that apartment that was on...I dont know. PCP, maybe. Or at least was a chance I was watching disturbed man hurt himself. So I looked quickly for the apartment number, which was 204, and then biked away. I didnt hear the sound of any doors opening or any feet pounding for awhile, so by around the time I got out of the apartment complex I felt safer. 

That feeling did not last. There was nothing down Main Street that was out of the ordinary, so I think I slightly convinced myself Id just been seeing things again. Not enough that I didnt start to work through in my head what I would say to the police when I called. But when I reached the small park that would lead to the post office before the beach trail that went home, it happened. 

I heard the rapid tapping sound of footsteps behind me. I looked behind me. Empty street, but I definitely could hear that sound. Then I heard a growling and snarling noise. I didnt see it, but I thought for sure that it was that same dog from the hill. Itd broken free from its strange owner and had tracked me down and was coming after me, still not visible even in the light of the full moon. 

I started pedalling as fast as I could. The Veterans Park didnt have any hills like the earlier one, but that dog still seemed to be gaining on me. It was barking and snarling like it had lost its mind as it seemed to be going faster than me even as I put my back into it. I stood up on the pedals but the sound of snarls and growls just seemed to get louder. 

I looked back behind me, and there was still no dog to be seen. It was only feet behind me now from the sound and getting louder. I remember for some reason why, after seeing those strange things earlier today, am I only hearing this goddamned dog? Still looking behind me I heard the sound of what seemed to be a dog jumping forward and the growling coming right at my face.

I dont know if my bike hit something or what happened exactly, but I found myself falling over and hitting the ground hard, my ears full of the sound of a dog attacking me. The snarls and growls made become so loud now that they hurt to hear. They were accompanied now by the sound of skin-tearing and gnawing, as if the dog somehow had my entire head inside its jaws, like it was killing me. I could open my eyes and see there was no dog, I could feel my cheeks and know there were no teeth sunk into them, that certainly the dogs jaws wouldnt fit over my head. But I still thrashed around and screamed on the ground and held my ears as tightly as I could from how painfully loud it was. I dont know how long I heard that dog attacking me, but I remember how it stopped perfectly. Instead of just stopping like youd imagine a hallucination to, I heard the sound of a dogs paws as it backed away. panted and lipped its lips, then sprinted away. 

I felt around my head again, checking once more for blood. I wasnt injured, of course, save a bruise on my leg and elbow. But I checked it again before I tried to get my leg out from under the bike and sit up. It was dead quiet for awhile as I caught my breath and tried to get my nerves back under control. When I finally climbed back on my bike, I was trembling so hard that I immediately almost lost my balance. But slowly, awkwardly I got out of the park and continued pedaling home. Naturally I completely forgot to drop off the dvd at the post office. 

I was on the beach path that leads to my apartment. It was still really bright for the dead of night. I mention that because theres sort of a beach of rocks about the size of office chairs that goes on for hundreds of yards between my apartment and the post office, and it was bright enough that I could see all the individual rocks. And I could really well make out what was in the rocks. 

It was a little girl, like not a toddler but not quite at adolescence, that looked like she was in a floral print dress. She seemed to be just sort of climbing from rock to rock and her hands and feet. I was afraid and not sure what I was seeing anymore, or i probably would have called to her and asked who let her play in a hazardous place at an hour like this. As it was I was I didnt even want to look at her. I told myself she probably was taught not to talk to strangers or that she wasnt real to justify not so much as talking to her. When I glanced over and saw that she was waving at me, I turned away quickly.

HI! she yelled at me in that kind of insincere but chipper way kids do. I didnt acknowledge her. I was looking forward at my apartment. It was a deep bluish gray in the moonlight and it had never looked so much like home. 

I heard her scream. It was not the sound of a kid yelling out of excitement or just for attention. It was a sound that was choked at the end. Something cut her breathing off violently and awkwardly. But I knew with the disturbed way my imagination was going at the time that I did not want to look over at what I was imagining was happening.

Helpfff! she screamed, something obviously muffling her ability speak. I wasnt 	going to look. I heard something like a hideous collision against rock, a sound with a crunch like something was being broken and skin was being torn. I kept my eyes on home. My imagination wasnt going to hit me with some vision. Then I heard the voice sound as if she were lifting high into the air as she continued her muffled begging for help. I guess it seemed to me that such a thing couldnt look real, that it would probably look ridiculous. Whatever it was, my curiosity compelled me to look up where the sound was coming from. 

What I saw was a puff of blackness against a cloud brightly lit by the moon. The blackness quickly dissipated as the scream abruptly ended. I was faintly aware of two objects falling to the rocks below. I couldnt make out what they were at all, but I had a feeling they were the worst part of all that had happened so far. That of all the things that Id looked at that night, those would two fallen objects were what I would most regret seeing. 

When I got home, I called the police immediately about the man in the apartment, assuming it was the thing that would be most likely to be believed. When they asked me if there was anything else they should know, I bit my lip and admitted that I had seen a little unsupervised little girl on the rocks near my apartment. That was all I felt there was to tell. I didnt sleep that night but I forced myself to stay in bed with my eyes shut, not wanting to see if my imagination had something else in mind. 

The next day, the police called. They wanted me to come in for questioning. What I learned down at the station was that there was nothing suspicious reported in Room 204, there was something of interest found on the beach. A girls clothes matching the floral print I had described were found along with socks, a shoe. A few questions later, they mentioned that they also found blood with bits of skin in it. I wasnt about to mention the things I heard and the small but unbelievable thing I saw, and I think I could tell from their body language that the police didnt believe me but they hadnt found any evidence that implicated me. So now Im under suspicion for the things I saw and the things I reported. But thats far from the worst part. 

When I started this, I mentioned that I had never hallucinated before that night. Well, now I do, and I know I am. Ive seen my eyes twist around my face in the mirror but felt my face and realized its normal. Ive heard that dog growling around and chewing my head when Ive tried to sleep. Ive seen that girl again, though from a distance every time since I dont know what she looked like. I see the man with his face still bleeding through apartment windows. I had gaps between seeing and hearing them that were long enough in the first two weeks that I occasionally had hopes the sight and sound of them was gone, but in the third week its become constant enough that I know thats not going away on its own. 

So thats why Im posting this online. If you know anything about any of this, who that person in that apartment might have been, who that girl was, any of this, let me know. I havent slept in days and I havent had much peace. What the truth is seems less and less important as time goes on. I just, I need to know why I saw what I saw during that night ride.

 Newsradio. It seemed like a perfect balance of personalities that kept you from getting bored by any of the subplots. Even as broad as the performances and writing got, they stayed likable to me.  




 A badly directed movie is likely to miss deadlines and go over budget.

No [William Dickson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6b0wpBTR1s) for some reason, but still a bunch of unfamiliar names and faces in it.  









 I like that Rarity's not blushing in embarrassment or anything. She's just pissed.  




 Enter The Void certainly has some memorably lit scenes that I like, but many people will probably just think they're tacky as hell if not headache inducing.  




 I'd wait for this to happen a couple times before leaping to that conclusion. Maybe he just wasn't in a chatty mood for a change. 




 I like to imagine she did something to make the lasers visible like blowing dust, popped her foreleg tendons, limbered up, bent down, and then just stood up and just barged right through the lasers to set them all off.  









 Pointless trivia: That movie's original title in German was Witches Tortured Til They Bleed.  









 How I learned that: http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2gqlt2/til_listerine_was_first_sold_as_a_floor_cleaner/cklqj9n 









 Little bit of a problem is she doesn't seem to be looking into the camera. It looks like she's looking over the viewer's shoulder.  




 Oh man, they have so many drinking games for it. Those pony mudflaps for their 18-wheelers. It's all good.  




 So what are we talking here? Like he possesses some pony or drags one away into the smoke (we later see he or she is fine cause it's a kid's show?) 









 I'll be honest, I don't really like that shot in RfaD. It kinda comes out of nowhere, has no impact on anything else in her story, and so on.  




 http://listverse.com/2014/09/18/10-of-the-worst-plagiarists-in-history/

I guess ones like Shakespeare aren't in there because the author would consider them the "best plagiarists" or something.  




 You must not have actually read it. 

"Tusk has a lot going for it. Michael Parks has a knack for making Smiths overwritten speeches sound like prose-poems, and Smith doesnt squander that assethe lets Howes long, winding stories anchor the movie. And that Mr. Tusk costume is genuinely horrific, with bloody scars and a general ungainliness that makes the Wallace-walrus look like hes in excruciating discomfort. (Theres a scene about three-quarters of the way through Tusk where Howe forces the man-beast to learn how to swim, and the combination of Wallaces panic and what he finds beneath the water is as terrifying as anything a veteran horror director couldve staged.) Tusk also has some subtle touches that speak to Smiths personality"

I mean, come on! 



















 Why in the world did I get more karma than you when my bit of snark was based on a false impression? 




 As a projectionist, my reaction would be "No, LYNCH! YOU ARE NOT MY FRIEND!" Then I'd crumple up the message.  









 This post briefly quadruples the digest's readership.  




 I was just curious what times before modern history its recorded that one nation heard another one had a natural disaster or something and sent workers, resources, or soldiers to charitably restore order (instead of as some cover for a military invasion.) 

Thank you for your time.   









 Oh, so you murder a few children and suddenly no one cares about the rest of your life!  




 The sad part was that Derpy didn't even use The Force there.  




 Now clearly she should have treated herself to a front row seat.  




 I'm surprised so many people don't know that Rarity is Jewish. After all her original name was Rariwitz.  




 Usually they mean the marketing was either underfunded or the trailer and promotional images were designed to give an inaccurate impression of the movie. Often this means that a satirical movie like Punisher: War Zone is marketed in a way that gives the impression it's played completely straight, then you see it and it plays its action and story for laughs.

 I just visited /r/creepy and all the top-rated posts are from imgur, none give the artist credit. There were credits for the artists in the comments, but obviously only a fraction of the people that will click the link will check out that. I've done this rehosting stuff too, but I always try to cite where I got it from. Why do so many people upvote links that don't give credit?  




 I am bored shitless by there being black   white morality in movies and kids should be taught that villains and heroes are so easily divided in real life. 




 That's not the source. SCP doesn't create original images, just takes them from wherever online without attribution.  




 Source please.  




 Like, when Youtube shows an eleven, twenty, or forty minute ad, clearly that's way likely going to be skipped through instead of the fifteen second ad. Does it reward the channel at all if the viewer is willing to watch/let the full ad play out on a seperate tab?

 The reason you guys like these fucking overposted stories so much is that they're so short even your tiny attention spans can deal with them.

 SomeOrdinaryGamers is terrible.

 Unforgivable! No biscuits or anything!  









 Like I said, Retsupurae does it a lot. Plus X channel may have way more subscribers than you would if you decided to just start your own and there can be significant cross-promotion.  














 I just saw Retsupurae's latest video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-OWaeBpqh8 and hearing that they had a fan that captured the initial video for them made me wonder who here has done that for a channel with a bigger fandom than theirs or whom has that done for them. How did it work out?  




 When I opened my eyes in that cabin and I felt the straps on my arms, legs, and across my torso holding me fast to the bed with a tarp beneath me, you better believe I was praying to God for help. It was a one-room building with paneled walls and a musty smell. I must have been where whoever brought me there was sure no one could hear anything that would happen. In the far upper corners there were ceiling mounted cameras aimed at me, red lights on. Along the far wall there was a table with a green plastic sheet over it. There were the tips of instrument handles visible on the table. 

I struggled against the restraints, barely able to move my hands and feet. I screamed and struggled for what had to be at least a minute. I stopped only at the sight of the door opening.

A man stood in the doorway. He was six feet tall at least, fit as an ox, and a little bored. He wore a surgical apron. When I saw that, I began screaming again. He didnt respond as I alternately begged him for mercy and threatened him. He went over to a laptop the cameras were connected to and made some adjustments. He walked over to my side then.

Shut up! he yelled at me, his tone more annoyed and exhausted than angry. I complied.

Okay, checking, checking, audio test, he said. He went back to the laptop and played back what hed just recorded. After a nod of satisfaction, he picked up a piece of paper from next to the laptop. He looked from the paper to me as he read.

Hello from the husband you fucked along with her, he read robotically. 

E-Ellen? I said weakly. Is this about Ellen? But she said that- He looked up at me and I stopped speaking again. He shook his head slightly and continued.

Did the bitch even tell you about me? Are you still hoping youre gonna escape? You still thinking the man who strapped you down is just gonna scare you? Ive seen too much of you with her to ever let you live. Youre gonna die really slowly. Were are gonna watch everything. Youre not the first other man to stick his cock in her but you will be the last. He sighed, crumpled up the paper, and tossed it on one of the tables as he made for the instruments hed laid out.

Without so much as another glance at my face, he came over to me with a scalpel. He spread my largest and second toe on my left foot, and began to cut the webbing. I had never experienced anything like that before and showed no strength in the face of it. I shrieked like an animal.

Make him stop, I thought. Please God, make him stop.

He seemed finished with my left foot and made for my right hand. I tried to clench it into a fist but that did nothing to slow him down. He went for the flesh between my ring and pinkie finger and began to cut. I was dimly aware of mucus touching my lips as I tried to scream.

He stopped after an eternity and stepped back, breathing heavily. I faintly heard the sound of him peeling off his gloves. I begged him to not to continue while he got on two replacement pairs of gloves without acknowledging what I had to say.

He came back to me with a surgical retractor in one hand and the scalpel in the other. He grabbed a section of my lip below the nose in the retractor and pulled it. He pressed the blade of the scalpel against my lip and began to cut.

I couldnt take any more. I hoped hed forgive me.

Medulla! I screeched as loud as I could. Immediately he stopped. He went back to the table hed kept his instruments on.

Okay, hang in there, Joe. Itll be over soon! Ive got the tetracaine ready! Almost immediately after he took away the pain, he got out the kit to give me the stitches. While he was doing that, I actually fell asleep from sheer exhaustion. 

*	*	*

So now Im at our home. Hes downstairs doing the laundry, insisting on doing all the chores now. I dont think Ill be able to walk properly for a few days, but we have our story for how I got injured like this for our coworkers. He has all the written and video evidence he would need to show that it was consensual and that he respected the safety word in case I decide to go to the police or anything. Not that I would do that. 

He told me he was more than satisfied with what wed done. He really liked the little bit Id come up with about Ellen. Thats left me pretty satisfied too. Anything for him. I love him so much. I should have let him go farther. Next time Im sure I will. It wont be for some time of course. 

He's got a partner that will let him live out his fantasies. He didn't dare tell any of his old lovers about this fetish. He didn't hesitate to stop when I said the word. He loves me.

I know this goes far beyond a normal S M relationship, but it doesnt matter. He's never going to do this to anyone else. Not to someone who doesn't know the safety word. He's definitely never going to just keep going until I can't say the word. He loves me.

I haven't just given him a taste. I haven't made him want to go farther so much he won't be able to stop next time. He loves me. Hes not going to cut anyone else. Please God, hes not.

Please, oh please God.

 No, it's really mostly obvious bullshit. Accomplishments and skills do not make people [inherently happier](http://www.nj.com/parenting/index.ssf/2014/08/post_42.html) so your pie in the sky hopes that all you have to do is get a job with specialized skills or a promotion so you can fuck someone and its all better. That metaphor of how being a "nice person" is useless is obviously Pargin justifying his own and other people's dickishness based on professional desirability. Creating stuff often doesn't "increase your value as a human being" most of the time because many of us don't have the means to make our products do anything or share them with significant numbers of people or have a significant impact on those we can reach.    

I think people are overly impressed by this article because he isn't offering easy answers, but he's still offering simple answers that aren't true. Read his article about stuff you don't learn in school and he blatantly admits in there that he lucked into the position at Cracked that compels anyone to pay attention to him.  




 i.e. "Model wants to pander to nerds, asks which member of a local camera crew if they know someone with a room like this, goes and does shoot there."  









 I often deflect mockery by saying "In 70 years, what I'm doing will be retro!"  




 I've had this idea for the past few days and I wanted to know what you guys around here would think of it. I don't know if it would benefit from actually being shot like a silent film. 

The premise would be that some modern equivalent to Charlie Chaplin's Tramp character would be in a zombie outbreak, more or less going about his usual business by basically dodging zombie hordes through a series of improvised setups and gymnastic abilities. One day he runs into a female survivalist who is the last of her group. He becomes smitten with her and imagines her as a delicate flower despite her in reality being tough and completely uninterested in him except for he knows how to get where she wants to go safely. As they make their way there, she insists on killing zombies (sometimes gratuitously) but he is completely abhorrent of the idea, arguing that some day they might be cured. 

That's all I've got in mind for the story right now. I just wanted to see the reaction around here to it.

 I have no idea whether this will help, but apparently Jan endorsed it on one of his videos.

 To my mind "Salad Fingers" was boring as hell because it was badly animated and had some lousy artwork, so it just seemed predictable that he'd go with creepy or whatever since it gave the impression he wouldn't be able to draw anything else.

One mentioned she saw this thing about how she learned there is non-pony MLP fanart (like when the Mane Six are drawn as donuts or whatever) and wondered aloud what else there might be. I  said "if it's a noun, there's a My Little version of it." And she was quiet for a second and then said "ARE YOU A BRONY!?" I said "not so loud." 

I thought then "Ah ha! Now she'll find me creepy and not let me work in the kid's section, but probably not enough to fire me!" I thought I was free of my least favorite part of my job. Then she said "I love you even more now!"

 *The following document was forwarded to me from a person who works with the Minnesota State Hazardous Response Team. The informant said its extracted from a word document that is the only evidence that it was within their power to take from the scene of an unconventional, classified emergency action. The reason the informant gave for sharing this was that it might be in the public interest that word of the emergency be made available before official disclosure.*

Badum. Badum. Badum. Badum. Badum.

Im typing this in what was a cabin in Cook County, Minnesota. Its forty miles of wilderness to the nearest town and at least ten miles to the nearest other cabin. Youll hear all about the place soon on the news. Or maybe not. I dont mind much either way anymore. Its more likely youll hear some version of what happened to me, eventually. Theres a reason I had to go to a place like this to hide my face while I waited to disappear. Theyll want there to be some version of what happened to me to tell the public.

This started three days ago. The fridge started making a horrible grinding noise, so I got the manual out. There was no phone to call a repairman for it and I dont have a connection to the internet, or I would probably have tried to get in touch with someone a thousand times already during my lonely periods. Anyway, the manual said it was a problem with the vents in the back around the fan getting clogged. I pulled the fridge from the wall, removed the vent cover, and saw that the fan was surrounded with dust and hair. I cleaned it out.
I might not have noticed the moss then, but I was so bored at the time that I decided to clean it much more thoroughly than necessary. I felt along the bottom of the metal frame housing the fan and then recoiled. I thought Id electrocuted myself for a second, but I knew that what Id felt was not electricity from past experience with hotwiring.

I felt it again. It was smooth, warm, and soft. It was quite similar to human flesh. And there was something else about the thing I felt down there that differentiated it from any known mold.

There was a pulse like you can feel at someones neck or wrist. Id felt pulses enough back in the day that it was the first place my mind went when I felt that sensation. And along with it, I felt a very light spray emit from it, like if you squirted cologne on yourself from way too far away.

I tried to tear it out and get a look at it, but it was too firmly attached. Frustrated, I went and got some drain cleaner which dissolved the patch quickly. When I cleaned out the remnants it a red sludge. It was just like the leftovers from when I and my associates used lye on a body.

Like many things in my life I was able to rationalize that pretty easily. There were probably plenty of molds I wouldnt recognize. I knew I had seen red funguses somewhere on television or something. The pulse could have been my own. If you use your thumb when taking someones pulse, youll end up feeling your own. I convinced myself Id felt something similar to that.

Badum. Badum. Badum. Badum. Badum.

Taking off the gloves after the last of the sludge went down the sink, I realized I hadnt washed my hand before putting on the glove after I felt that faint spray. I absent-mindedly sniffed it weakly. It smelled surprisingly good. Like chocolate and flowers. Of course I washed it off, but I was surprised at the time that it smelled so nice. In fact, I felt a little happier than I would have expected after washing it off.

Early the next morning, when there was just enough light to make the inside of my cabin a dark blue, I heard the fan for the fridge again make a horrible grinding noise. I stumbled out of bed, pulled the fridge away from the wall again, unplugged it, and then I froze. I could smell chocolate and flowers.

I thought I might have been smelling things and maybe seeing things through bleary eyes. A glass of water sounded like what I needed to clear my head. I drank half a glass then poured the rest out. Although I couldnt see into the sink properly in the weak light, I realized there was no gurgle of the water draining.
I turned on the light above the sink and saw it.

There was a mass that had grown out of the drain. It was slowly, rhythmically expanding and contracting slightly like it was breathing. A large blue vein was visible, straining against the skin.

I bent down to get the drain cleaner. My hands were trembling as I tried to unscrew the lid. Even then, I knew it was useless. What I had done yesterday had merely left this thing to regrow in the u-pipe or somewhere. Surely pouring more drain cleaner onto an even greater mass would hardly stop the growth. But it was all I could think to do at the moment.

As I poured a bit of drain cleaner onto the moss, its surface spasmed. It released a powerful spray of whatever that scent was. I couldnt force myself to keep pouring. I was became fully relaxed even as I stood there trying to kill some being of skin. The moss gradually stopped spasming even as the drain cleaner slowly stopped eating through it. It seemed, at least to me, like it was relaxing too. It released more of that wonderful scent.

Badum. Badum. Badum. Badum.

Its okay. I understand. Im not mad at you. Thats what it felt like it was trying to communicate to me. Even then I knew I should have tried to tear out the plumbing or leave the cabin for somewhere else on foot, but I wanted more of that scent. I felt the best I had since Id started hiding up here.

I stood over the sink for a while, just breathing in that odor. I could no longer care what was in that spray which calmed me so. I looked over at the fridge vent. I could see little bits of the flesh moss growing out through the vents.

Since then, the moss grew and grew faster as it went. It now coats the inside of the cabin like soundproofing, For how loud it is, the sound of the mosss pulse is very relaxing, like the nature sounds people play to help them sleep. Its the badum sound Ive found myself typing a few times as I write this. I imitate the sound with my mouth as I do.

Acid is beginning to leak from large pores on this flesh moss. Its not strong enough to eat through metal but anything organic that it touches is being dissolved. The soles of my boots are almost gone now. I can feel the skin on the bottom of my feet beginning to be eaten away as well. But what matters most is that the moss has continued to spray that wonderful scent even as it releases acid. Im in pain, yet I dont mind.

The mosss pulse is speeding up. I think it wants to digest me faster. I am considering lying down in the acid to help speed it along. Its the least I could do for it.

Badum, badum, badum badum badum badum badumbadumbadumbadumbadumba

 




 I'm legitimately beginning to think of tiny, unoriginal horror shorts like these as "twist porn." It's not scary, it's not believable, it's only supposed to be interesting because it's ostensibly surprising.

I have no idea why he went for specifically beetles instead of insects in general, but whatever.  




 Huh. I thought they'd require a W-2, paystub, or somethin, but alright.  




 I was paid for this other small gigs through paypal. What paperwork would I need claiming that other pay?  




 But why design it so it seems like he's looking over my shoulder instead of at me?  














 Clearly a shared universe. Be ready for plenty of surprise cameos! 




 Let me guess: It's the story where there's a doppelganger under the bed.  














 I heard from an industry insider that Richard Williams was threatening to miss his deadlines on Who Framed Roger Rabbit and at the end he was effectively fired but had handed the animation long enough (plus Union rules) that he got the Oscar anyway. Anyone know if that's true?  




 Yes, it's very obvious what the premise of the original strip is. My point was that the bonus panel didn't put a humorous spin on it or anything.  




 Moments in movies where a camera movement or the way a scene was lit  made you laugh. 

One moment that comes to mind for me was Tropic Thunder.

SPOILERS

Ben Stiller's character is taken hostage and forced to sort of perform as his character Simple Jack. He is put in a humiliating outfit and constantly beaten to do so. When his rescuers arrive, he says he doesn't want to leave because he's finally found his audience. When he says that, there's a shot of him where there's a light on his face that makes him look kind of movie menacing. It was hilarious to me the contrast between his slapstick treatment and how now he was feeling empowered and menacing.  




 By contrast, I just saw a kid kicking a dragon puppet in the library and was  unwilling to do anything. He might still be at it for all I know.  




 Wow, there's no joke. Just self-hatred.  




 "Purposely put the trailer?" How would he do that accidentally?  









 Edited OP to clarify question.  




 I have a really dumb one: when I was like seven or so I watched this movie called Jingle All the Way where Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a busy dad who tries desperately to get his kid a toy. I must have bought way too much into the idea that the dad was neglectful, because there's a scene where Schwarzenegger has to pick his kid from out of a crowd to give him a toy, and I seriously worried "Oh no, is Schwarzenegger going to be able to remember his kid's *name*?!" That or I was weird as hell.   




 What's something where later thinking about a movie, you found yourself saying or thinking "I thought _________!" and couldn't believe it later? 




 Is this a reference?  




 I really didn't get that. Isn't that going to make them enormously more expensive and risky, going to clash with your expectations, make it harder to sell the special effects, etc. When your target audience is usually kids or nostalgic adults anyway, wouldn't you assume they'd prefer the look of a cartoon if the cartoons became classics anyway? 

Sure, it paid off a few times like when movies like George of the Jungle became hits, but it seems like the risks and bombs would outweigh that.  

EDIT: I mean, why, if you're going to reboot a franchise, would you adapt it live action instead of as a cartoon? I should have clarified that more. I certainly get the nostalgia aspect.  




 I move around and change identities. 

Just imagine how unpleasant it would be to think you would be immortal your whole life well into like your thirties, and then to find out you weren't because you just got diagnosed as terminal.  














 Ah, but inimitable by children, so they'll allow it.

 Ive been an atheist for a long time, and I spent a long time trying to get my mother to see the light. She never seemed to pass up an opportunity to buy a new book or dvd by Joyce Meyer or some other self-help huckster who would tell her what she wanted to hear about needing to stop worrying and put her faith in God. I tried to convince her that God as a concept was irrational, that her religion was built on lies and bad ethics.
 
That stopped yesterday. 

Mom called me up out of the blue and pleaded for me to come over. When I arrived, I let myself in and saw she had taken everything Christian she owned, from bibles to plates with The Last Supper on them, broken it all, and assembled it all into a cross in the middle of the living room. There was blood drying on some of the broken glass. 

Mom, what is this?! . 

Dustin, she called from her bedroom, I need you to pray! I was getting out my phone to get an ambulance while jogging to her bedroom. The door was locked. 

Unlock this door, Mother! 

Pray!  Really, truly, pray! She screeched at me. I paused and whispered a prayer that Mom be okay. I have never regretted doing anything more in my life. I have never felt secure, alone, or hopeful since then.

There was a voice that reverberated from inside my head while I stood outside her room. 

*Be not afraid, but I bring you dark tidings.*  









 These images have clearly been doctered.  




 So, those are different subsections in the aisle? 

I don't want to think about the difference between a MLP toy and something that's specifically a Brony toy.   




 What's that from?  




 So they couldn't get the guy that played Vern Schillinger for this photo?  




 Let's hope it doesn't have the same infuriating ethically blinkered ending that Close Encounters does.

I'm sure we've all heard about Dennis Rader by now, but I hadn't known that was how Ed Gein was caught.  




 Okay, fixed.  




 Up there, 

there is so much room, 

looking down on Sweetie Belle and Apple Bloom, 

I wouldn't have to fear Fluttershy's stare, 

up there!  




 You... really don't want to know what Rarity is doing under that helmet.  




 A. A Christian is drowning in the sea. A boat comes up the crew tries to save them, but he says "no, God will save me!" Later another boat comes up and tries to save him again, but he insists that God will save him. Later a third boat comes along. The Christian is wheezing, gasping, almost exhausted, but manages to wheeze out "no, God will save me!" Then he drowns. In Heaven, he asks God why he didn't save him. God says "I sent you three boats!" 

B. An atheist is drowning in the sea. Getting desperate, he says to himself "Okay, God, I know I've never believed in you before, but if you save me, I'll not only become a believer, I'll become the best believer. I'll go to church, do my best to never sin. Please save me." Then a boat suddenly appears out of nowhere with a crew getting their life saving equipment ready. The atheist says "Never mind, God: I got this!"  




 Okay, is the appeal here supposed to be sadistic glee that someone gets to annoy a person professionally obligated to tolerate them? Like, is this porn for douchebags who wish they weren't too cowardly to personally treat people in this shitty manner?  




 I finally saw this film and I couldn't believe how forced and overwritten some of the dialogue was. Like "fuck me gently with a chainsaw" roles terribly off the character's tongue when just "fuck me gently" would have been so much more natural and quotable. 

Did the screenwriter ever claim that the dialogue was supposed to be like some sort of satire of kids trying to sound cool? Is there any indication the lines were supposed to be legitimately cool? Dean is clearly supposed to be a deconstruction of the idea of being cool and edgy, so I thought the idea was kinda legit.  




 John Landis supposedly doesn't like it either. But apparently George Romero is fine with it for his movies since when he first watches movies it's either through an eyepiece or through a monitor, so technically all movies are directed on a basis of being made for television.  




 Is the chickenbutt thing really a joke though? I think of it more as a Dadaist commentary on language.  




 I understand most people would probably assume that they are having a sensory problem of some sort, but you would not believe under any circumstances that it's God communicating with you, right?  









 Pretty much just on the show.  




 This might be a private hangup, but I enjoy the visual design of the show so much that even when curtains are torn up or vases are broken it kinda peeves me a little. Yes I admit it would completely ruin it even as a kid's show if nothing could be wrecked or damaged, but I still don't like it.  




 So, is it funnier than the first one or better animated?  




 She learned how to hot wire the Twinkling balloon long ago.  









 Grrr... We hate Adventure Time!!

(Right?)  




 To be fair, knowing Arthur Conan Doyle's spiritualist beliefs, he probably didn't care too much about the real laws of physics anyway.  




 Oh alright, I'll give them another chance. Thanks for the thought.

 God, that original ending would have made it my favorite movie of the year.  









 Awesome! I love mods.  









 A lot of my favorite ones still seem intact, like the ones about The Other Side of Midnight being used to persuade theaters to screen the movie or the special effects department only producing one usable shot after one year.  




 I recently tried How Did This Get Made? and hated it because they seemed to make the same jokes over and over (i.e. a character's autistic if the character's underacted, one of the hosts will say he jerks off to something, etc.) and the podcast We Hate Movies for the same reason (they constantly say "who gives a shit" and any adult that interacts with a child is a predator no matter what.) 

So, what are some good alternatives?  









 He went to the school of hard knockoffs.  




 It actually was kind of bad voice acting. Some of her word emphasis was so unnatural that it was uncomfortable.  




 This is so well animated that it's annoying how awkward some of Fluttershy's dialogue is written and delivered and how the humor needed work.  









 Just lower your standards. It's gotta work eventually.  




 As a free-spirited student who's too cool for school, I say yes.  




 Normal.  









 It probably wouldn't be so slowly paced with lingering shots on uninteresting bits and ends in Spencer's room, so it'd have to be a step up (I like Eraserhead, but I imagine most people's biggest problem with it is the pace.)  




 Bet they went there right out of their parents' basements.  




 An image of a police officer not being portrayed as Satan got upvoted? How'd that happen?  




 If so, how did you react? Did you immediately get resent the manipulation? Did you not care? 



 




 Nah, it's genuinely clever and witty IMO. But then, I am a psycho hillbilly.  




 She might as well claim it's a parody so that she can publish it with fair use protection.  









 Exact opposite for me. My elementary school experience sucked because my parents had way more money troubles then, fought more, and my mildly abusive brother lived with us. 

Foreveralone doesn't seem so bad sometimes.  









 So this is funny because he claimed to be drunk? 




 I would not. Science kinda has my back on that one: http://www.forbes.com/sites/olgakhazan/2011/09/12/is-listening-to-audio-books-really-the-same-as-reading/
 




 http://listverse.com/2014/09/25/10-movies-sabotaged-by-their-own-creators/

Few novel stories in there, a few which are kinda samey. I think the one for Un Chien Andalous is the most interesting but don't watch the clip unless you're already kinda jaded.  




 Probably novelty value. If it didn't look weird and/or creepy, we wouldn't be talking about it.  




 Being a sociopath doesn't mean you're cool as a cucumber under pressure or don't have a sense of self-preservation. 

That said, Dahmer had supposedly been living a lie pretty much his whole life by then, so he probably thought he knew how to handle it. 

 









 The joke was that Pratchett's anger would drive him to just spitefully kill off the cast of his greatest success.  









 CGP Grey rambled on his podcast recently about how in his opinion the ideal way to go into a movie was completely cold. Like, discovering it at home, comfortable on the couch, coasting through Netflix recommendations, not even reading the summaries.  
























 I've never hired a prostitute but I'm working on a short story which requires it so here we are. 

My assumption is that maby sex workers would be bored and do a bad job hiding it or they'd try too hard to be pleasant. Which of these is more accurate (if either of them is true to life at all.)   




 That was actually The Island of Dr. Moreau. Also supposedly he got some police transmissions and such during takes and in the middle of a line would say things "there's a robbery at Woolworth's."

http://thefilmfacts.blogspot.com/2012/12/calling-all-cars-marlon-brando-in.html

For Apocalypse Now, he's clearly adlibing. In the outtakes he says things like "I can't make up any more dialogue for today."  









 Eh, it's not that cool. It really has to stretch for some of the shots.  




 Those British forts look really cool. Yeah, I guess it would be creepy to spend the night in them, but that's true of any abandoned isolated building.  




 I thought for sure you were going to show a mashup video.  









 People just won't stop telling Bradbury he's [wrong about his book](http://www.factfiend.com/ray-bradbury-told-interpretation-book-wrong/).  




 Are you looking for other jobs?  














 For example, I read this article about Clerks: http://www.avclub.com/article/the-new-cult-canon-iclerksi-2239

And I must admit that even though I'd seen the movie before, I'd never thought about it the way he put it. I'd also never heard anyone call the movie on that before either. Do you have any examples that come to mind?  














 He can play timid very well. See "The King of Marvin Gardens."  




 How much sexism have you experienced in this field?  









 Gritty? Pure comedy? Fluffy? G or PG? Do they go on an adventure or is it more lowkey? What's your preference?

 




 Santa is like the spirits at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark: No matter who you are, you will die only on a basis of whether you look at him.  









 [Hmmmmm...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6ArcmLYVKs) 









 Is this some of that rape culture I've been hearing so much about?  




 I think this is a really great cover for Gerald's Game: http://officialmattroberts.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/geralds-game-cover.jpg

This rerelease one strikes me as kind of silly: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sph-E-jJmL4/UORwT_63WBI/AAAAAAAAGKQ/PDBadysEhcI/s1600/GeraldsGame.jpg

Also, yeah, that pink cover for To Kill a Mockingbird is a bit of an eyesore.  




 Boy, I don't think Ford was the lynch pin for Blade Runner in the slightest. Really, I think Deckard is the least compelling part of that movie.  




 Okay, I am in talks with the [White with Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl4kgoeSbNo) director to adapt a short story. It's tentatively entitled "Please God" but that may change. 
[Here's the story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up2JBb_d8GY)

TL:DW: a guy wakes up in a room strapped to a bed. Someone comes in and tortures him purportedly because he was having an affair with the wrong person's wife but actually because this is the torturer's fetish and the tortured person is indulging him because he thought this would be the ultimate act of love. 

So, which of these approaches would you recommend: 

A. Prolonged POV shots (Not a gopro, I think those tend to shake too much to properly simulate vision) to make it more immersive. 

B. With conventional multiple camera setups because then people pay less attention to how the video is being shot and more to the story and acting. 

Thank you for your time. 

 




 [NO](https://www.derpibooru.org/453566?scope=scpef0677957565deb4ebe6e6d63dd162be045af676a) 









 Nah, people could probably still say what they thought of the game into a webcam. I meant if every major let's player was hit with third party content matches or copyright strikes.  




 Oh dear. I just realized I still kinda dislike Pearjack for that time she narced on Fluttershy. I am clearly a bit fucked in the head.  




 I understand this is borderline out of the question unless I guess some company thought they could knock out the big names and replace them with their own to make the games essentially long ads. I guess it's more about whether you really need that footage of gameplay to really know how good a game is. 

Personally speaking I've never really just rushed out and bought a game on the basis of a Let's Play video versus a written review or a trailer, but this isn't about me.   




 I ask because it remains probably my favorite single fanwork even though I'm a little too young for the kind of games it's an homage to. I think it balanced the storytelling and gameplay just right and its rudimentary graphics are much more evocative than they reasonably should be. 

But has the fandom at large just sort of lost interest? 




 Hey! Watch it Pinkie! He ruined causality to get into a relationship with Twi, so don't you try to edge in on that! 




 I guess there's the Up series http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_Series.  




 Gonna make a Thneed out of it?  




 I have a manuscript I kind of set aside for awhile which I took a look at again and now feel might have potential, but I want a second opinion and to get the thing in shape to show to a potential agent. 

I know it will probably cost me over a thousand dollars to do this, but that's not really a problem.  




 You know what's really funny about that? A year or two ago, Wong said in the "Writer's Workshop" (a subforum for writers to pitch ideas to each other) that if Cracked ever became the kind of page that had to run that kind of clickbait at the bottom of articles, he'd quit writing for it.  




 You know why the pop culture stuff is so much better? Because it's just taken from TvTropes. 

Seriously, I used to write for the site and I saw people blatantly group together lists taken from Tropes and WMG pages.  




 Any man who must say "I am the director" is no director.  









 British hearts don't melt, or there'd be nothing left.  




 This might just be a related question, but isn't there a relatively big Brony community in Russia?  




 If I lived in Finland, I'd view everything as cancer just to make life interesting.  




 Taken from username Cookie Monster's comment on an article about the movie: 

"One more thing that make Star Wars work so well, that only just occur to me for first time, is that it not try and shoehorn in romance. Luke and Han both flirt with Leia, but story never about one of them getting girl. Leaving that storyline to Empire Strikes Back work well, because second installment not have to do as much world-building and have room for romantic subplot. But it also make Leia something other than prize for hero to get at end of movie. When she and Han do get together, they on equal footing, because first movie already establish her as independent person.
(This is also one of many things Guardians Of Galaxy successfully copy from Star Wars template)"

 I've plowed my way through a few books by Sandra Brown, who's had more than [sixty bestsellers](http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2012/09/27/a-conversation-with-north-texas-best-selling-author-sandra-brown/) and I'm amazed at how terrible she writes female characters as being. They're either explicitly made to be unintelligent and loose or repressed and boring, particularly the ones in Seduction by Design.  I believe I've seen a couple of hers fail the Bechdel test, even. 

Have you ever found this with some other female authors?

 "We're gonna make those damn Johnny Rebs shit themselves when we come for them! Unfortunately it will mean we can't fire upon them."  














 I didn't mean they'd necessarily ship two background characters, just that there'd be a same sex couple. Probably one made specifically for the episode.  




 So really badly animated and pixelated in the sheets?  




 This OC is all wrong. That mane is supposed to be red! 




 I was bullshitting with my brother about the show while we were doing an errand and we mentioned the whole "Lyra/Bon Bon" thing. He wondered if you could show like a same sex couple in the show. Not something like it's central to the episode and it becomes a very special episode which would bore the shit out of kids, but they're just there and maybe they've adopted a kid or something. 

On that note, since there are a lot of conservative parents out there that watch the show, are there any controversies like that or was it only the Brony thing that kicked up any dust?  




 I saw [this comic](http://i.imgur.com/V0BaBCw.jpg) and I became curious if there has been someone who made a good faith attempt at what she argues. I know it's a joke, but maybe an eccentric rich person or particularly hardline activist might have taken the notion at face value.    




 Has anyone ever donated land to Native American tribes?  




 You introduce a neat notion like that into my life and then crush it instantly? Why are you taking me on this emotional roller coaster?! 




 That's not very nice.  









 But my fanon says that whenever you cover a unicorn's horn their magic stops working!

 Still a good escape from being depressed about more worthwhile things.  




 I dunno, is time cyclical?  









 It's not about being "funny." It's about a repetitive format because that is reassuring and gives people's lives constancy and making obvious jokes because people will think "Hey, I thought of a joke like that! That means if this channel is funny, I am funny!"

 So now clickbait=any article on a popular subject?  




 
I saw Sarah and heard her many times before I believed she could be real. She hid in shadows, edges, and in corners of my vision. I would hear walking quietly and cautiously around the house at night--breathing, crawling through the attic, everywhere. Sometimes she would shriek or weep for some time. Everytime I saw her, she was carrying some kind of stuffed animal with her. She was here when I moved into the house. Shell be here as long as the house stands, perhaps longer. 

I know why Sarahs here. I learned about it by reading up on my home at local history at the library. What I read in this old newspapers... well, I had thought I experienced a bad childhood, but compared to hers mine was idyllic. Her father would be revealed by a postmortem to have suffered from a brain tumor at the time when he went mad. His madness drove her mother to leave the home, and he seemed to direct his rage towards his own body and her. She was not allowed to leave the home for her last few days as he became obsessed with a butcher knife. He apparently found many occasions to use it on her and himself. . 

Her life ended in something Ive seen reenacted many times now. On the last night, holding her stuffed bear to give her courage, she walked out into the hallway, a cut on the back of her hand opening as she squeezed it. She went to ask her father to let her leave the house. He must have gotten up and killed her then, because when this part of the haunting happens, she falls on the floor and begins to bleed out. 

I first saw her... reliving this experience that I finally believed she was real. When I saw her walk in to the living room that night, she was not a mere ghost of light or smoke. She was as physical as I was, though I still dont understand how that was possible. She was looking off to my left as she begged her father to let her leave even though I didnt see any sign he was present. 

I let this happen to her once. The second time she came down the hallway to beg the empty air to let her leave. I yelled at her to run but she didnt seem to acknowledge me. When she stopped her plea, which meant her death was imminent. I ran over, picked her up without thinking about the implications of what it meant, and carried her away.

I was expecting what I did to mean nothing: That she would just bleed and die in my arms again. But apparently, somehow, moving the body she had beyond reason from the room prevented her from dying again. I put her down in the bathroom and she was looking up at me, still alright 

I can hardly claim to be her savior, though. Shes still dead. A short time after I carried out of the living room, she still faded away and resumed the same pattern of haunting the house, even the part involving walking into the living room to ask her father to let her leave, as if nothing had happened. Well, almost. 

Just an hour ago, she came into the living room again, looking the same as always and holding a stuffed animal the same as every other time. She looked like she was strangling it. I had moved the chair to where her father must have had his, and she looked me in the eyes as she approached. 
	
Hello, Sarah, I said as I got up. 	

No. Please, no, Sarah begged as I approached. 

Theres no one but me who has to see her. Theres almost no one who would believe this pretty little girl is still on this plane of existence. No wonder I didnt believe she was real. 

How could I be so lucky?

Some of these are more obscure than others. I think my favorite is the thing about how there were a bunch of fake Chaplins. Kinda interesting how these days you see knockoffs of popular movies like Transmorphers and Kiara the Brave but back then it was about counterfeit actors.  




 NO ONE DAMAGE THIS APPLE!

Seriously, I have a weird thing where if there's a specific bit of food like a melon or whatever that a character is invested in, I hate to see it damaged. It bugged me in MLP when that happened to AJ's apple and when it happened to Gromit's marrow.  




 Why? Bears really aren't what comes to mind looking at this.  














 I get it: Larry David sucks as a comedian and as an actor. Thanks for the daily reminders, Reddit.  









 Christopher Plummer was *really* hoping no one would notice.  
























 This is a rather roundabout way for Criterion to announce they're going to release Greed.  




 Shame that Mansfield wasn't able to make a viral "Ten Minutes of Sitting at a Table with Sophia Loren" video and expose the objectification she experienced during that encounter.  




 Nah, it's appropriate. Non-college graduates would be the ones that wouldn't realize "oh, the higher ups just ripped off some hazing rituals."  




 Do you still drool over how gorgeous this shot is: http://youtu.be/3jLaf5qj8cs?t=2m5s

Or have you seen the movie so much by this point that you can't really get into it any more?  




 I know a lot of people warn the younger folk to leave this subreddit and things like that, but I genuinely enjoy reading comments and such on here. It's the subreddit where I don't feel a need to posture as a more normal and clever person than I am, where I can let it slip that I'm totally kissless, yadda yadda. 
 




 I wonder why don't you see this more often. 









 Because I mostly read positive stories in terms of filmmakers making financially successful films against all odds, I was curious if anyone has a particularly bad story of a movie just ruining everything for the people that made it. 

All I have is one my professor told me about that he had a friend who shot a movie on 35 MM independently. When it was finished, the friend wasn't willing to show the movie to anyone else, never mind seeking distribution for it.   




 I know his horror stuff is generally considered at best hit-and-miss, but I just listened to an interview he did with Kevin Pollak's Chat Show and if nothing else, the story behind the making of Cabin Fever is fascinating. I imagine if he wrote out and edited his thoughts it could very well be one of the most fascinating stories in the history of movie making, or at least in the top half.   














 Probably Breaking Bad. But that's because the only other shows I've watched in their entirety are The Wire and Oz. I'm not a completist.  




 I knew someone who complained about Taxi Driver because she said the soundtrack reminded her of The Dark Crystal. The fact Taxi Driver came first by like a decade didn't matter to her.  









 I was watching a Let's Play video of Ethan Carter and was really stunned by the graphical quality of the portion on the bridge over the river. While I saw some things that in hindsight were very well-designed such as A Link to the Past and that sort of thing, it never really leapt out at me as beautiful-looking or what not. 

I didn't ever play it as a child, but I was surprised when I looked back on it at how well the graphics of The Curse of Monkey Island held up when I tried them a little while ago. I also liked some of the stuff in King's Quest V more than I would have expected for how primitive it is and for how difficult some of the gameplay can be.  









 There's cute, and then there's just showing off.  




 I was watching Robocop (80s version) for the first time. There's the character of Bob Morton who is presented as this complete sleaze, a really lame guy when he tells Murphy "You are gonna be a bad motherfucker!" and all that, but towards the end, I kind of found myself liking him anyway even though he was clearly supposed to be unlikable and usually I wouldn't like a character of that type. It was odd. 

Ever felt that?

Just skip over #9. It's a really lame entry, but the rest are pretty weird.  




 But that he noticed this particular reason to kill Krazy 8 is really unlikely unless Walt was practically an X-man.  




 I and a guy in Las Vegas are in preproduction on a short based on this story: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up2JBb_d8GY (with permission from the author)

The TL:DW of it is that the story is about a guy being tortured because he had sex with the wrong guy's wife. 

Now, if it were your job to shoot this, would you take: 


Option A: Shoot it conventionally with closeups, fairly conventional shot lengths, etc. 

Option B: POV shots from the victim's perspective, ideally only two of them if possible. 

I imagine I don't need to go into any details about the pros and cons of each option.  




 It's all that chemistry training. You shatter enough test tubes and stuff you can eyeball shattered things and notice missing shards. 
...

Okay, yeah, it's a stretch that he noticed this.  




 Impressionist Twilight.  














 This is just a knockoff of "Yoga Hoosiers."  














 "Not even close." 




 Not that you'd know it from actually watching him.  









 Since you've hit more than 150% of your goal, do you have any stretch goals in mind?  




 I'm still a fan of their comedy style, but while I was watching their track for The Dark Knight, I honestly decided about a quarter way through to just turn theirs off and just watch the movie. There are flaws to be found in the movie, but I believe it's well enough made that even the jokey nitpicks aren't very entertaining.  









 Pretty easy when you give the cat that slow-motion handicap.  
























 Do you have any idea how disappointing it was that there aren't any misspellings in your bio?  




 I wonder if there's cider on the sun.

 Thirty years minimum, dude. Not twenty.  









 I've seen numerous people bash the movie on the basis the plot is full of action movie cliches. It was bewildering.  




 No Urotsukidoji? Bah! 









 Tried to die, but I failed.  




 News from 2016: Star Wars Most Disappointing Movie of 2015.  




 I know it's clearly not what happens in this movie, but wouldn't it be amazing to have a movie where we never see the main character's face? Just all POV shots, silhouettes, or shots where his/her face is obscured.   




 Personally, he's the guy from OZ, a million audio books, and the History Channel. One of my favorite voices ever.  









 I have never gone through a list of bombs and thought "good" so many times.  




 Do you ever get contacted by people that want you to sell their dowsing stuff?  




 http://listverse.com/2014/12/28/10-creepypastas-adapted-into-even-creepier-short-films/

Some of them are way the hell more creepy than others, and I'm sure many people would switch them around even if they were told they had to keep these ten. But there's a few on there I'm glad I saw.  




 Not really. It's kind of forced in it's creepiness (the use of b w is a dead giveaway to me that they're trying to be creepy rather than make porn.) It's also nothing like the short story, and the author of the short story called the site lame: http://gadgets.gunaxin.com/interview-nes-godzilla-author/173878 




 I'll say Psychosis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YugLGMYX030

I think the pacing is great if nothing else, even though it's a long one.  














 "Does sad mean 'goofy' on this planet?"  




 You... think wolves are pretty dumb, don't you?  









 I know calling us autistic or aspies is something countless people online can't go ten minutes without doing, but this is a sincere questions without malice. /u/ScalSaver noticed some points in a recent thread about the character: 

she doesn't pick up on facial cues quickly, if at all.
but she doesn't quite get that other ponies don't know what she knows (= bad theory of the mind)
She has difficulty understanding what other ponies are thinking.


That seems a pretty reasonable case, whether or not it's intentional. 




 It's just part of being a libertarian. Doesn't matter what movie it is: You don't want tax dollars to go to it being preserved.  




 I had to wait a damn month after accidentally seeing that my brother bought me a twelve pack of cream soda. She can wait for her birthday cake.  




 Is there an ideal way to read Only Revolutions? I remember chancing upon that in the library, opening it, seeing how it was formatted, and then immediately reshelving it.  




 So that's what... fifteen that have ever jammed? 


jk 




 What? It has made less than half of its budget. How is that 75% of what it needs to break even? Now a lot of the hype has died off and bad word of mouth is spreading.  









 Most of these are more silly that creepy.  




 That is some objectivist horseshit there. 

"Duh, me one of those dumb blue collar guys that never should aspire to better. Me in right place. You exceptional: You should be in better, right place."   




 It's a prequel about how Wooderson is Mason's real dad.  




 Only on Facebook.  




 In the history books. The person on the street, after France, China, the Japanese, and then the Americans called it "this shit again."  




 My brother insists that Pinkie Pie works better when she's actually a kind of compassionate being. She's supposed to be so desperate for parties and fun because it's the only way she knows to try to make others happy. That's why it's supposed to be so important to her when she gets her cutie mark that her family like her party set up, and that if she only cared so much about candy and stuff she could have just entertained herself. That's also why when no one's around she goes so crazy. 

I argued that it makes her too much of a goody-goody and that she needs to have some selfishness and such. She's also kind of stunted and oblivious at the end of the day, and she'd be less compelling if she's so selfless.  




 That's when it gets the hose again.  




 I was just listening to an interview about Big Eyes, the movie about those Keane paintings, and they were talking about how Keane was supposed to have both started the idea of selling the story behind the art, not just the piece itself (also there's that commercialism of art aspect.) I've also heard this said about Van Gogh and such. So what pieces rely totally on their intrinsic merits and we have no idea who made them or under what context they were made?  




 Is she the one that was interviewed on First Person?  




 The true mark of quality, I guess. 

I've heard before the internet, Clerks was supposed to be the most stolen movie. Does anyone know if that's true? 









 Please excuse me if this feels too cynical or too focused on business for this subreddit, but I've got a manuscript I will soon have edited and if I cannot interest a publisher in it, then I'll have to do this. 
 




 I and a friend just got into an argument about Ready Player One. I looked for someone to back me up online and was surprised to learn that there were relatively few reviews that had my back on this. 

You had any books where you had that feeling recently?  














 I don't know, this just doesn't seem creepy to me. It's more like sad or unpleasant.  









 http://listverse.com/2014/12/28/10-creepypastas-adapted-into-even-creepier-short-films/

Warning: a few of them are based on those video game horror stories that I think even Creepypasta fans think are pretty bad. At least one of those is a parody, one's short, and the third one's kind of okay.  




 Why is Scootaloo mad? 
 




 Just your magic to slightly lift yourself up when you're on the scale. It works for me.  




 It's the "already famous for it" that makes me laugh the most. The thought that the guy not only is famous, but his girlfriend doesn't know about it and random people are aware of how fast his rise to prominence has been.  




 Do people give you guff about reinforcing gender stereotypes by associating female players with pink or something like that?  




 So she gets killed by it too? 

Alright, which generation clone is Pinkie by now?  




 I was just wondering with my friend how much The Interview would have just made Youtube and how that cut compares to a movie theater.  




 I haven't seen any of these. But I'm going to change that pretty substantially this weekend!  




 So how much of a percentage would Youtube have taken from that?  



















 Anything of yours available on Youtube in authorized postings?  









 He'll be sure to cut in enough new scenes to make it six hours long.  




 I was watching Reefer Madness: The Musical. There's this scene where the main character's love interest is shot in the chest and she's bleeding out. The guy is cradling her in his arms and she reprises an earlier song "We are just like Romeo and Juliet. We're happy, young, and * Cough * Hemorrhaging blood." Now obviously the movie is deliberately goofy, their relationship is clearly unhealthy, and the lyrics are silly. Really, I imagine audience members would usually hate the character singing by design. But I actually welled up when I heard that line being sung. My only excuse is that Kristen Bell is a very good singer and all that, but damn, I bet it would have gotten a laugh if in the movie there had been a cut to a close up of someone watching that scene.  




 Aren't there four artists for it? 

Also yes, I thought it was shit from the first comic.  




 I think it's the fact he went alone that made it awkward.  














 NOTE: You don't have to agree that it was a sexist movie, it just has to be one where you would have thought people would complain about it. 

I was archive binging and read an old review about Clerks and I was surprised that it hadn't occurred to me that its gender politics are kinda questionable, especially since the indie film world that made Kevin Smith's name is so attached to progressives: http://www.avclub.com/article/the-new-cult-canon-iclerksi-2239

Any other movies where you're surprised more people didn't talk about that?

 Challenge accepted: Sombity.  




 I've had an insanely good year at the movies, since the worst I saw by far was Maze Runner.  




 That's more Talmud than Christian bible.  




 These characters are supposed to be idealists, not out for money. They want to actually treat patients.  









 Isn't it common knowledge now that buying a new car is one of the worst investments you can make and you'll lose thousands of dollars driving it off the lot?  




 I know it's a stereotype that FA people idealize the idea of having a relationship to an insane extent, but I had a reaction that I think was an example of this that I think most people would think was pretty funny.

So yeah, there's a real "that guy needs a girlfriend" moment for you. Yours?   




 I know that cancer is actually many diseases that sort of get lumped into one category. Let's just say one that would be most feasible for a small, underground organization to make.

This is for a story I'm working on in case you're wondering. Profit margin isn't really an issue since the characters involved are driven by ideology. Also the characters are intended to be chemists themselves and thus can steal and bribe to get materials not normally available.

Thanks for your time.
 














 Yeah, I'm freshly arrived from /r/foreveralone, but this is something I've seen in porn a few times and I've been kind of curious about it lately. To me the stuff smells kinda unpleasant, but some people insist that there's something to the smell of sweat too, so what do I know?  




 Sorry, OOP apparently meant to post this as the source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W78pPCtt9d8 




 So? Why should women lower their standards?  




 Being Dilbert probably doesn't help.  




 Still better than the results of when Pinkie claimed she was super skilled at making cupcakes.  




 Another bad breakup, I'm guessing. 









 He could really relate to the scene where Mason took someone's McCain '08 sign. 




 Or at least one comic artist is not likely to enjoy it.  




 That's what Tia has been rated?  




 I... am... not... a... gun.  




 The situation she's in now is way creepier than she is.  









 Deleted scene from The Room.  




 Sorry, but the sped up foot movements still look kind of silly. I don't know how to make that work, though. Maybe the actress had to be weighed down so that when she ran, it looked more like she's actually running.

 That's at least forty cents too little! 




 Didn't one of those old games with the ludicrously bad cut scenes have you play as Zelda for it?  









 This is more like an anecdote than a rant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKbAEmvZyKQ unless he went on about him on Smodcast or something else I haven't seen.  




 The comment section on that article is hysterical if you're obsessed with the Simpsons.  




 Well, that's a bit much for being annoyed by overexposure to something they don't like.  




 Because it's such a well-known film, I hear it bashed pretty often. This  is particularly by parents who are sick of their kids watching it. Online of course there's a lot of bile for it too. I feel compelled to defend it a bit for the reason given in the title, but of course it would kind of be a waste of time. 

Blargh.   




 I think it would be funny for there to be a character in MLP that is actually happy with being alone and Pinkie kinda butts up against the idea (unlike with Cranky where he was unhappy with his loneliness and turned it into bitterness.) 









 This is just CG?  




 So AJ and AB are way closer in age than I would have thought?  




 I don't get this. Is this a reference to something another performer did? Or is it just that a character on a children's show is being unpleasant?  




 Are the guest rappers worth checking out? I found out about Dan Bull from the Jack the Ripper rap and became a bit of a fan.  




 It's unlikely that some of them will be accessible in your area, but I heavily recommend these: http://thedissolve.com/features/2014-in-review/851-the-best-2014-films-that-made-under-100000/

 If you have the time, don't pass up an opportunity to check out Dangerous Days: The Making of Blade Runner. It's about three hours long and totally worth it.

 Back then doing just about anything was a bitch, so you just got used to it and plowed ahead on.

 Huh, I didn't know Hank Azaria was a Disney animator.  




 Britain waives the rules.  




 Obviously it barely matters that the characters in MLP are horses, but just around the time I was joining the herd I got a quick gig feeding and watering horses for a family. They really weren't that nice, with only the oldest one being willing to let me pet it at all or anything. 

One thing that stands out in my memory about that gig was one night it got horribly cold, like -7. I lost a bit of sleep worrying about how cold they'd be in their stables. Then I showed up and let them out for their feeding, and one of them started rolling around in the snow. I should have been she was okay, but I remember being pissed that I'd  been worrying about this horse and then it felt like she was unwittingly rubbing in my face what a waste that worry had been.  



















 So is this an illustration from one of those Rainbow Dash books that Daring Do is so obsessed with?  




 Oh my god, as much as I feel prostitution should be legal so that it can be regulated and all that, this sentence made me laugh so hard. I just imagine them all convening on wherever the meeting point was at once, maybe carpooling.  




 Their comedy sucks ass and in PDP's case his personality seems so calculated and horrible that it's sickening.

 I'm not saying I'm above it or anything. I just know from second hand experience that of course relationships don't solve all your ills. I have to imagine anyone that would settle for me would probably come to resent me pretty quickly. I'm probably not mature enough to adjust to a relationship and at twenty-eight it's probably a bit too late.  

Not that I've lived a bad life and this is some kind of tragedy. In fact, sometimes it helps things feel a little better.  














 I think you mean Room 237732 mooR. 
























 1. Working for Cracked was less pleasant for me pretty much across the board. Meaner editors, often terrible feedback (admittedly because they had more pitches to read so they felt they had to skim a lot) and political agendas for lists I didn't agree with. 
2. I could write what I wanted for Cracked, but it was pretty much all spec until they posted that it was approved.  




 1. Once. It was a guy covered in fake plant stuff like he was cosplaying Swamp-Thing and holding a flower. I said "Guilty over his part in the Kennedy Assassination, the Grassy Knoll became a hippy." 
2. It didn't win.  




 1. I'm fine with it as long as they give links and credit to artists, and try to include actual research and commentary on it. 
2. That said, my favorite site like that (other than Listverse of course) is clickhole.com.  




 Seeing it. I assume what happened was during a period when my brain was developing my sex drive while I was really young, I saw it happening in some cartoon and that somehow got mixed in with my impulses. 

But as far as I know, that might be debunked Freudianism.  




 1. I never would think Cracked going "SJW" is one of its problems. I'd say it's real problems is when it reports inaccurately for the sake of clicks. Jason "David Wong" Pargin has numerous articles full of complete bullshit if you actually research them (particularly his private obsession with insisting being overweight is untreatable except through surgery, which his own sources don't condone anymore, or his "Monkeysphere" article.) If a writer reports honestly and gives the facts accurately, it doesn't matter to me what their agenda is. 
2. I assume that was a dig at J. F. Sargent. Well, he was always nice to me but I remember a lot of factual holes being poked in his article about video game prejudices. I haven't read much by him since that I can remember, so I don't know if he does more thorough fact-checking now. 
3. I think Cracked is way better than it used to be.  Much as people get all nostalgic for 2007, that was when Cracked reported straight up horseshit sometimes because they didn't have to cite sources or when Pargin would say a suicide note without a suicide was "gay."  




 fwiw, it doesn't really bother me either but I only tell people about it online. 

Best thing about FA is it means you've got nothing to lose socially! 




 There was no *like* about it! 




 1. Probably because I saw it in cartoons a lot during my sexual development. 
2. Eh, why not?  




 1. If Cracked's editors accept one of your articles, they make you fill out a form with your tax information and such before issuing you a payment through paypal, which is a one time thing. 
2. Jamie Frater at Listverse just makes you fill out a form granting him rights to the list and then sends you payment through paypal.  




 You're welcome.  




 Yes. I said it was weird.  




 Sigh. 

I'm thinking Twi's new castle will feel a lot colder and less homey by comparison.  




 Hey Mr. Baruchel, was making This is the End fun or mostly a pain?  




 Yeah I could. I just have to draw it or pay someone to.

 Eh, it's just a matter of conditioning too. You can use associative training to induce phobias or whatever. Same thing, except generally accidental.  




 Can he swing
From a web?  




 Seeing cartoon characters inflate like balloons. 

Incidentally, I was going to be interviewed by former Cracked writer Ian Fortey about that for a book he's working on, but that seems to have fallen through.  




 What about that doesn't make sense? It's about your brain forming a connection between a certain thing and stimulus.  




 I think Kurt Vonnegut said he tried to do the same thing with Slaughterhouse Five.  




 1. I got banned from Cracked from mentioning in a comment section that the editorials sometimes are disdainful of contributors and suggesting that they recruit new writers because they pay them less than the veteran writers.

2. Yes, they often alter written articles. I've had my points about people completely flipped because editorial thought it would fit the tone they wanted better. I would have preferred they just send it back to me with a "do over" note as that would have encouraged me to do more proofreading at a younger age.  




 1. Never read an issue of Cracked, I just read the site. 
2. I do remember reading Mad magazine in sixth grade, that was pretty sweet.  




 1. I find my own ideas at Listverse and Cracked. Cracked occasionally kind of assigned articles, but that was primarily for columnists. 
2. Hmm... Probably the one above about obsession art is my strangest list.  




 1. Listverse doesn't force a comedic tone that their high turn out means will become samey and kinda grating after awhile. 
2. As a writer, Listverse is much more open in terms of ideas they publish. I'd never have gotten the film inventor article published at Cracked unless I'd become a columnist. 
3. Listverse doesn't force in certain prejudices against acceptable targets. The fetish art article above would have had a much more judgmental tone if Cracked had accepted it instead. 
4. As a reader, Listverse puts all its content on one page. 
5. As far as I know, Adam Tod Brown isn't an editor at Listverse.  




 1. I got banned from Cracked from mentioning in a comment section that the editorials sometimes are disdainful of contributors and suggesting that they recruit new writers because they pay them less than the veteran writers. 
2. Listverse pays less per article, but for me it's been such a better experience that if I'd known what I was getting into I would have quit Cracked long ago in favor of them.  




 I have one that I think most people would find incomprehensible instead of creepy. It's the type that gets mocked on Somethingawful and Encyclopedia Dramatica every once in awhile. As ridiculous as it might seem, it cuts down on the need for a human sexual companion a bit, which as someone who has the lack of confidence that some psychologists believe leads to a fetish anyway, is out of the question for me anyway. 

You too?  




 http://listverse.com/2015/01/20/10-provocative-works-of-art-based-on-one-persons-obsession/

I like how the title tries to dance around it not being fetish art but the article is really blatant about it. 

Pretty sure it's actually all SFW, but why risk it?

 Literal pointing and laughing when I fell in a river during a hike during a school camping trip. 

Holy shit does remembering this ever make me feel less alone.  




 I've gone on a study tour of Vietnam, done rock climbing in Texas, swam in the Pacific Ocean and tried to surf (seawater is some nasty shit.) I've tried going on bar crawls and gone to fancy restaurants and hotels. 
Never while doing any of these was I happier than when I watched a movie I enjoyed.   




 This is actually kind of old and someone did tell this very rude person how to leave the group. I didn't include that in the screencap because it wasn't funny.  




 Of course not.  




 I'd just prematurely ejaculate and then wait for her to leave.  




 I've gone on adventures. They've all sucked. Expensive, uncomfortable, often very annoying because they involved sitting around waiting for something or led to something disappointing. 

I don't envy the adventurous.  




 I just saw Selma and it got me wondering if there were situations in, say, Russia where after the serfs were freed police or soldiers had to be dispatched because certain local governments would not free slaves or grant the freed slaves their basic rights? 

I don't know if the fact that in U.S. history it is generally understood that it took a civil war to end slavery while most other nations ended it without a war makes that country anomalous.  




 Yes. If I had the money, I would have myself chemically castrated.  














 Women drinking when they're looking for casual sex. I am not saying women who have bad experiences as a result of their impaired states deserve anything at all that happens to them but I don't understand why you'd do that in such a risky situation. It just seems to increase the risk of being assaulted, contracting an STD and/or getting impregnated, or having sex with someone you wouldn't want to if you were sober. It's like going out snowmobiling but intentionally worsening the steering or smearing your visor in advance.  




 Why would anyone take life seriously? Horrible people are on top for completely unjust reasons. People get away with crimes all the time. And it's all effectively pointless since eventually we're all going to die and be forgotten no matter what. You'd have to be stoned off some endorphin or another to take something like that seriously.

Oh, they must have forgotten to tweet or share a link to this thread.

 Yes. As tempting as courting the progressives and the LGBT community might be, Disney is well aware that conservative countries and the heartland are their bread and butter so they'll make sure to squash those homophobic complaints.

A few of these I was genuinely surprised I'd never heard of before, like the whole marijuana thing and the toilet movie. By the way, has anyone ever heard of Arnold Spielberg outside of in relation to his son?  




 The deer eyes are so distinctive that they made it so that I had to take a few moments to study the reverse and see that it's supposed to look like a seal when it's flipped.  




 Certainly not. I don't mean to be snobbish, but even as a kid, I felt "huh, this Harry guy is just like another chosen one" since I'd already seen The Matrix and Star Wars and that was a bit of a hurtle to ever getting too immersed in it.  




 I'm trying to be offended, but honestly, I think they look too well done for that.  




 It feels like it doesn't really honor the man properly if it's not somehow equipped with devices that kill anyone that touches it.  




 Creepy nothing! That looks awesome!  




 For what it's worth, I was quoting an alternate take from that scene.  




 I've seen numerous ads for them and became curious what you guys would have to say about them.

I think the thing about losing 184 calories by watching The Shining is a bit dubious but overall it's pretty neat.  









 I'm not trying to claim I'm a badass or anything, I just have a thing that if something is going to creep me out, it usually needs to be ugly or aesthetically unpleasant some way or I'll think it looks good. 

For example, I think the images this artist posted (NSFW) http://imgur.com/a/mg9l5 are more beautifully done and awesome than they are creepy. Even this http://i.imgur.com/noEpc2T.jpg is more moody and atmospheric for me than it is cool, but that might be because I used to take walks in the early morning when it was often foggy like that.  




 There really are better ways to store all the teeth you collect.  




 Thank you for your apology.  




 Personal Landmark anecdote: I was going to attend one of their recruiting events, but I overslept and missed it. 

It was a time in my life where I was too much of a fuckup to get swindled.  




 Finally! The gritty Toy Story reboot! 














 What's so badass about that? I thought that was one of the early signs Walt was actually the villain of the show. It's just random, petty destructiveness.  




 I admit I'm a latecomer to the fanbase, but from what I understand, it was a low-rated show for the first few seasons until Gus became a major player. That's around the time that Walt and Jessie stop being compelling bumblers and start becoming quotable criminals that fans start finding "cool" and such. Is this impression correct?  









 MPAA rating calls "shenanigans."  




 Youtube ads. I like the thought that my checking out their video made my favorite channel a tiny amount of money, so I'll just open another tab and do something else until the ad's over.  









 Isn't this more like a fish ranch than a fish farm? 

That was just an excuse for saying thank you for doing something that we'll need more of as a species soon. It must have been very difficult to develop.

 How did you not know that's what Legend of the Overfiend is? 














 It was about the prom date that took the brooch and hung out with other guys.  









 It honestly kind of made me uncomfortable when Donnelly called that woman a cunt.  














 Not from what I heard. For example, when they were talking about how the past wasn't as sophisticated as we remember, they just mention the things from the articles (Police magazine existed, Sugar Sugar was a #1 hit, etc.) with no further analysis besides saying "Now, you think THIS, but..."  




 The climax and ending of this movie just don't work, I don't care how meta the ridiculous of the movie is supposed to be. It's rushed, too silly to be invested in anymore, and unsatisfying.  




 I never thought this image really worked since the way it's cropped it looks like it could so easily be faked.  




 I assume that's New Zealand dollars, cause I heard those trees only cost $500 American.  




 I'll buy that for a dollar.  









 A lot of it just seems to be stuff recycled from the articles.  









 I remember there being a lot of snot in this movie which really grossed me out as a kid.  




 Between this one and the Fluttershy booping herself one, I like to think there's a running theme developing of the ponies being embarrassed by their human equivalents.  




 I know and have listened to multiple people who love bad movies in person and through podcasts. They will talk about generally traditionally masculine subjects like sports and the like, but when they talk about bad old movies, they won't shut up about hairstyles. Like if they mention Road House or some bad cult movie from the 1980s, mullets and such will come up. I have heard so much about the rat tail Anakin Skywalker has from people that hate the prequels, 1970s hairstyles for movies from that decade, and so on. I have never heard people talk about this in regards to good movies.

What's the deal?  




 No, that's why I asked.  




 Is this spec?  









 If he had hit that cub and the mom went after him, he'd probably still be able to pedal away from her pretty easily, right? 




 But that crowd is going to stereotype everyone anyway, and hey, at least if the documentary existed it would indicate we're willing to admit those members of it exist.  




 Winter is infinitely more uncomfortable than it is beautiful. Much as I love this movie, it is in the top three Disney movies I would least want to be in. 

The other two are Mulan because of the mountain scene and The Little Mermaid because I would drown quickly.  




 I heard the guys on Retsupurae complaining that Unexpected is too biased towards positivity and The Dissolve had the same complaint about BT, so would you be interested at all if someone made one about the clopping, gore fics, bullying, and so on? I imagine getting the cooperation of the subjects might be a little harder or involve more deception.  




 At this rate, eventually they'll go a live action The Girl Who Leapt Through Time and it'll all be worth it.  




 Roth and company are too embarrassed to admit this, but the only copy of the movie got locked in a time capsule.  




 The Rumpus Room was lost forever when the house went into the sinkhole in the movie.  




 Crap. This actually bothered me. I might need a pony hiatus.

Starting tomorrow.  




 Pretty much everyone else in the world saw Inception, right?  




 Isn't every pony "______butt" then? Why did the fans nickname her specifically Sunbutt?   




 That's the most generic comment I've ever seen on any genre. I've seen this said about anime, comic books, comic book movies, tv shows, folk music, etc. There will always be people who dislike the way things currently are because they don't realize there was lots of forgotten junk in the past and think the past was better because only the classics remain. 

Name any era of horror and there's lots of obscure terrible content that can be pointed to as evidence that at that time people weren't exploring its potential.  









 Isn't he modelled after one of the writers?  




 I wonder how much licensing a show costs.  




 But Yoda said that the dark side isn't stronger. If the show was part of the dark side, the light side would just get its ass kicked.

 1. Boredom. Scenes that do not add to the characters, story, or tone and which are only there to stretch the movie to feature length. 
2. Annoying characters included either as comic relief or because people being shrill is supposed to be relatable.  




 Are you making a timelapse video?  




 That is some passive-aggressive, convoluted revenge.  




 Just yesterday foal Fluttershy posted a tutorial on how to mouse! 









 Eh, honestly I found it kind of boring. It had all the trappings of fun sci-fi but it just didn't know what to do with it.  




 What a twist. It's like Psycho.  









 I will stand by my belief that it's so over-the-top it circles back around and becomes funny again. Somewhere around the pointless electrocution.  




 I'm really looking forward to an all-female cast for this one! 









 Rarity felt like throwing up a second, smaller Fluttershy is how that's possible.

 You looked more like her than she did?  




 "I'm not proud. Well, I'm a little proud." 

This was clearly meant to piss MRA types off so they'd share it and hate it.  




 Have you ever found out you sold stolen goods?  




 How necromantic.  




 As a former Eagle Scout, I hated camping so much for eleven years that going out into the forest in general is torture.  




 A year ago when my Dad died and word of it got around at work.  














 I wrote a quick story for NoSleep about a child predator, and people were suggesting a sequel where the guy gets punished because in the end of my story he's still in control of the situation. 

My take on horror is that doing so would weaken the story. That kind of moralism feels cheap and too clean. Like, in reality, I get both the feeling a lot of perpetrators get away with it, so having a punishment in this situation feels off, even though it's a supernatural situation. It also feels like it goes against the point of the story to make people feel uncomfortable. 

Of course people will claim that's an excuse to make exploitation, but I mean solely in regards to how fictional characters are treated.  




 Yay! Free balloons and rifle covers! 




 To be fair, for a lot of them, like me, it is kind of a choice. We choose to not risk humiliation, we choose to not do a lot of the things that might make us more attractive, and we choose to not settle for desperate equally unattractive people.  




 If he was too nervous to even be in the same room as a stranger,  I assume he didn't used to be too socially active.  









 That's not very stoic of you.  




 It hadn't been on my mind until the last second, but for my birthday yesterday I remembered several restaurants in driving distance that offered free birthday meals. So I ended up having three dinners. 

I'm killing myself at the gym but I'm not about to cut back on food either.   




 Yes. You're supposed to feel like sharing it.  









 They shouldn't be women's shelters. They should be domestic abuse shelters. I worked at one of them and they took in battered men too. Many victims of physical domestic are men. Yes, women clearly have it worse, but that's statistically relevant.

 In another exciting, stupid chapter in "/u/test_subject9069 Goes to the Gym," I tend to go late at night and stay for awhile because I have a lot of calories to burn and a lot of other people have friends or whatever so I feel lonelier being around a bunch of other people. Because the lights are motion activated, apparently I can use an elliptical in the corner and the lights will go out. Last night at like two a.m. another guy showed up who looked like he was in his forties and heavily balding. He seemed surprised to see me there cause the lights were off and I guess he had the same social anxiety I do only much worse, because he went and hid in the bathroom, periodically coming out briefly in his gym clothes before seeing I was still there and going back inside. 

Guess I should start coming in earlier.  




 Yeah? Wait til it's also like that at work and most social events like concerts.  









 I tried to take a satisfactory selfie but the lens of my camera broke.  




 Every day I hate myself more and more for the two years I spent burger-flipping. So fucking stupid. 

Yeah, I know this option wasn't available to me, but still, being a bit poorer would have been less embarrassing that all the scars I got on my hands and arms.  




 Last night I couldn't sleep so I went to the gym. I kind of lost track of time and was still there when the bars closed and people began coming back to the dorms, the gym being near campus. I was on an elliptical, my favorite exercise machine in the world, which faced out one of those windows. 

Now several times, people have come up in front of me and either mocked me by making exaggerated elliptical-machine-use- gestures, mostly I assume because they're drunk or maybe I look weird using the machine at 2 in the morning. 

Last night someone came up to the window again and started doing those little handwaves people do to look cute. I didn't really look but I'd gotten sick of people doing the arm pumping thing at me so I flipped her off. Then I looked over and saw it was by far the most attractive person who'd interacted with me in years looking kind of hurt that I'd done that, and then she turned and walked away. 

Obviously she was probably condescending to me for being the weirdo in the gym at that hour and even if I'd smiled waved back it wouldn't have meant anything, but still, *shit*! 

So, what are some of the ones you've experienced?  




 No, lots of people who have it way the hell worse than me cope with it by laughing at the situation. A person with a shitty life has nothing to lose by life ending and ultimately meaning nothing. Now someone with a sweet life and a potential to leave behind a legacy is someone who wants life to have a point and for humanity to keep going if only to preserve memories of them.  




 Of course it's better to be in a large city. To quote an overweight openly homosexual filmmaker that Kevin Smith had on his podcast, "If you are a gay man in an urban area, you are never more than ten minutes from a free blow job."  




 Hit on them, embarrass the fuck out of yourself. Then you'll want to avoid the hell out of them instead of be around them.  




 I think it's the amount of effort you exert. I probably could make myself attractive enough to stop being FA, but I can't get motivated.  




 28 this year and I haven't had a conversation with a woman who was a stranger or under fifty in months. 

Come and eat chicken with me, Beautiful. It's so dark!  




 You probably aren't an artsy type, but my thing was I found a guy who had an art project he had trouble with finding anyone else willing to help him. He was as insecure/creepy as I imagine people find me, but I just concentrated on getting our stuff done so it wasn't a bother.  Boom! I had an instant wingman and even though I didn't get laid, I know it makes you much less off-putting to women to show up to place with a companion. 

Then after graduation he moved away and since then I kind of lost interest in socializing and projects since about last year.  




 Horror show?! The pointlessness makes it easier to see it all as a comedy, not scarier.   




 It happens. A guy who called me a faggot a couple times and tried to pants me in gym went to prom with someone I had a crush on. I imagine that didn't work out very well for her since she seemed pretty feminist.  









 Inflation.  









 That German photographer. Just kind of an annoying stereotype.

 Succeeds: The Neverending Story IMO because it incorporates the 4th wall bending into the story, sort of.

 This came up in the comments for a recent review of Jupiter Ascending, how it sounded like a good movie to see high. I was wondering if people bother to do that much anymore or if home theaters killed that off.  




 My point was that neither is badass.  




 Oh god no, that's the last thing I want to do when I'm FA unless it's cold as fuck outside. But that's why I'm planning to move to Texas this year.

 Seriously, anyone that upvoted this here: Why?  




 We're probably going to want to move somewhere farther away for if it finally happens.  




 Do the compounds break down? I assume it's not because something like bacteria builds up in the bottles or something.  




 No, that was just the cover story.  




 That bit I'm referring to is the bit at the gas station where Walt goes up to the car of that guy on the phone, puts the squeegee against his battery and blows up his engine. 

I don't get why this is supposed to be cool. At best it seems petty, at worst it seems really stupid. The guy didn't do anything to deserve that and Walt served no purpose except venting his anger in a barely understandable direction with little fear of reprisal. It seemed to me like saying it would be badass if Walt kicked an annoying chihuahua or something. I just don't get it.    




 Eh, I didn't need BCS to be great. We've already gotten a great series from this environment, a good one in addition to it is fine with me.  




 I am Jack's nodding head.  




 Christ, I hope my fetish remains unattainable. It would be horrifying to see in real life. Luckily there's a lot of porn of it.  




 Well, the source was cited on the Derpibooru page.  









 Mine is kind of gross and obviously the sort of thing a teenager would come up with, but here it goes:

I had a scene where a sort of newly met couple were sleeping together. The girlfriend wakes up, can't get back to sleep, then realizes she's going to fart. So she gets up, goes to the bathroom, pulls her pants down and does it, and then wipes before going back to bed. 

Now, I thought that this was a character thing that would reveal how fastidious and insecure she was in an interesting way, but it kind of came out of nowhere in regards to the rest of the story and struck my "beta readers" for it as so weird and stupid that they actually got mad at me about it. 

Yours?

 No, because no one's preventing me from interacting with them. I'm just insecure and they don't want my attention, I assume.  














 One day in September of 1983 we decided to go on a patrol camping trip so that wed get some prizes at the end of the year. Our scout troop owned a campsite up on top of a big, rocky hill. It was just our rotten luck that when we agreed to meet to start the campout, there had been a steady rain going on all day that didnt look like it was going to stop for hours. But our parents were all either going away for the weekend or thought rain was no reason to cancel a camping trip. Anyway, it was just barely going to be warm enough for this to be our last chance to have a patrol campout that year.

There were four of us trudging up one of the thin paths on the hill with our limited gear under dismal green ponchos: Me, Eric, Tony, and Sam in that order. We were miserable and irritable except for Tony.

We had reached a point where we enjoyed hurting Tony. Tony was one of those kids that get put into Boy Scouts of America only because they have a parent that wants free babysitting. I imagine most of the time his mom mostly talked to him by yelling at him, and the only way he knew to relate to the rest of us was to annoy us. He was also the youngest guy in my patrol and the shortest so it was fairly easy for us to bully him, especially when we thought he was doing his best to bring it on himself. I think Tony was delighted that the rest of the patrol was already on edge so it would be easier for him to get a rise out of us. At that moment he had decided to focus on Eric.

Eric was a real goody-goody most of the time. He was a pretty good athlete and an A student. Im pretty sure that at fifteen hed never had sex, a puff of anything, or any booze. But he loved beating on Tony as much as the rest of us did. That seemed to be his only vice, and frankly, it kept the guy from creeping me out by being too perfect. Hed certainly looked ready to give someone a beating when I glanced back at him during that little hike.

"Hey, Eric! Tony said. I glanced back over my shoulder. Tony had run up next to Eric like a puppy dog cause he knew otherwise Eric would ignore him. There was barely room on the path for him to do that if he turned himself sideways.

What? Eric said.

I can read your mind! Sometimes Tony would be weird or still like a little kid when he pestered us.

Okay. Eric said. I looked forward again.

Think of a number! I can guess it! Tony was pitching his voice up.

Okay. Eric said.

Its thirty! Tony told him.

No.

Youre just saying that. Really I was right. Wasnt I? Huh, wasnt I? From the sound of ponchos rustling, I assume that Tony began to push against Eric. He would do that for minutes on end if youd let him. Sometimes he might even start humping your leg if you were another scout.

Get away from me! Eric said. I didnt see it, but it was obvious even before I turned round what had happened. Eric thoughtlessly pushed Tony away, just wanting the little creep off him. As narrow and slippery as the trail was, he had pushed Tony off it. Tony screamed as he went down the very steep portion of hill, almost catching several trees before having his legs tripped out from under him by a stump. The stump was unfortunately only a little uphill from a large sandstone rock. Tony went into it headfirst with a sound of a loud crack! I stared at him for half a minute or so then, and he didnt so much as twitch from what I could see.

On my god. Sam said after a long silence, which seemed to snap the rest of us out of it.

Lets go help him.

Yeah. I said. Back then, this meant running down there to carry him to the nearest house out of the park since cell phones for kids were still decades off. I tried to start down the trail but Eric was still standing in the way. He turned to me.

Weve gotta tell people what happened right, Sam stopped and looked over at us. Eric looked down at him. We need to tell everyone that he slipped and fell, got it?

Weve got to help Tony! Sam shouted.

And we will! Eric said. But first, we need to be clear that were going to tell everyone that he fell, right? You got me, thats what we tell everyone?

I dont know, I said, I didnt see it happen. Eric looked and me, and nodded. That seemed good enough for him. Then he looked back at Sam.

You pushed him. We have to help him,  Sam said in bewilderment. Sam had never been the cleverest guy in the patrol, but I would have thought hed have the sense to play along under the circumstances.

We will! Eric responded. But first, I need you to say that youll tell everyone that he slipped and he fell! I nodded desperately at Sam, gesturing for him to tell Eric what he needed to hear so that we could get down there to try to help Tony.

No, Sam said. Eric stared at him.

Alright, Eric said. Lets go. We walked quickly, not about to run for fear of slipping and falling like Tony just had.

It wouldnt have done you much good anyway. Sam said after a little while, apparently trying to help Eric feel better. Tony still would have told everyone you tried to kill him no matter what.

Yeah, but thats Tony. Whod have cared if the rest of us had our story straight? Eric answered, his voice flat. He seemed to speed up from behind Sam.

Which way do you think would be the fastest to- HEY! Eric grabbed Sam. Sam yelled as Eric dragged him to the edge of the path.

Say it! Eric shrieked. Say that youll tell everyone that he slipped! Eric sounded more scared than he did intimidating as he held Sam at the edge of the path, seemingly ready to let him fall.

Fuck you! Sam yelled and he began to flail. He hurt Eric more than I would have expected, judging by how Eric grunted. Maybe it was pure adrenaline, but Sam got free somehow and began pushing him to the other side of the trail, right into a cliff.

Jesus Christ, stop fighting! I yelled at them. I might as well have been speaking Chinese. I took a few steps closer and saw there was murder in both their eyes, so I stepped back. Sam got his hand on Erics chin and pushed his head into the rocks behind him as hard as he could. Eric was really trembling then, like an old man with Parkinsons. It was as if he was experiencing a panic attack in the middle of a fight. Even so he wasnt going to just take Sams beating. He grabbed Sam again and kind of picked him up like Sam was a tackling dummy and then charged forward blindly, Sams poncho over his face. He misjudged the distance to the edge of the path and both Sam and he went rolling down the hill. They struck trees with sickening noises as they fell to a level area.

They were much more fortunate than Tony. I could see their movements and hear them screaming when they stopped falling down the hill. But neither of them even tried to get up.

I walked as quickly as I safely could down the trail and then looped back round to where Sam and Eric were. Both were yelling for my help at first, but as I proceeded down the trail, Eric abruptly went quiet.

My legs broken! Sam told me as soon as he saw me arrive where theyd fallen. The bones sticking out! It was true. His poncho had folded up and I saw the bulge in his lower left pant leg beneath the knee. Blood had soaked through his pants with the rainwater.

Hey, Eric said flatly. His lack of emotion made me look over at him as Sam screamed at both of us. I think I hurt my spine. I cant move my legs. I cant feel them. From what I could see of how his body was twisted, that might well have been possible. I didnt know then how Eric could be so emotionless about it, but in hindsight of course he was in shock if not in psychological denial.

Alright, guys, Ill go do what I can for Tony, and then Ill get help for everyone. I said. Sam screamed at me that that was the wrong thing to do, that I should leave the park to get help immediately. For all my first aid training, I didnt know if either of us were right. I thought maybe there was something I could do with the first aid kit for Tony, whose injury had seemed the most severe. Maybe Tony had vomited and I had to clear his breathing passage. I had to check on him. I tried to reassure them before leaving. Sam swore at my back as I ran over to Tony while Eric remained quiet.

I ran to where Id seen Tonys head hit the rock. I had walked by it on hikes and camping trips numerous times and knew the rocks and trees. Id seen the rock that Tony had hit his head on numerous times and knew when Id reached it. When I did, I froze for what felt like minutes.

Tony was gone.

There was no sign hed been there except for some blood had pooled by the rock where hed struck his head. It was still wet and red on the sandstone. I looked around and called for him. I ran a short distance each way around the rock. I didnt see a sign of him. Not a footprint in mud, a drop of blood. Anything.
I something else as I searched. Sounds seemed to be fading away. I could hardly hear the rain around me. I couldnt even hear my footsteps in the shallow puddles on the ground. I couldnt even hear Sam although I had been seconds before. My own voice seemed muffled to my ears. I had been afraid before, but Id never known the sound to fade away like that.

I began to feel something. Not the feeling you get when youre being watched, but the one you get when someone you fear is standing right over you. I turned, and there was no one there, of course. The feeling didnt let up. It seemed to grow stronger and stronger. There was nothing to hear, not even my own breathing or the beat of my heart.

I ran back to where Id left the other two scouts, as fast as Ive ever run towards anything. Slowly I could hear again that Sam was still screaming in pain and cursing out Eric. Eric barely moved his head to look at me when I arrived. Sam went quiet after I told them of Tonys disappearance.

How? was all Sam could think to say. I felt that sensation again of a presence all around me again. It was faint but noticeable.

I dont know. Sam, how are your arms? Can I carry you out of here pack strap style? I had two years and eighteen inches of height on Sam, so I knew I could carry him out. Sam said I would. Whatever presence I was feeling, he seemed aware of it too through his pain and he didnt need to be sold on being taken out of the park, painful though it would surely be. I got out my first aid kit quickly, left my pack on the ground, and hastily made him a splint. He screamed as I lifted him up on my back.

Wait! What about me?! Eric asked, some emotion back in his voice. I glanced over at him. His eyes were wide, and his skin was becoming pale.

I can only carry one person. Well get you help as fast as we can.

But, what if whatever made Tony disappear Looking back on Eric, I find it hard to fault him now. He was just a kid. Hed made a mistake, meaning only a little if any harm. The a smaller amount of harm that wed all inflicted on Tony time and again. Then hed seen all his life, all his accomplishments, his future, all about to be tarnished because of what hed accidentally done to someone we all mostly thought of as dirt. He overreacted like probably many of us would back when we had little life experience and perspective of a guy in his lower teens. But at the time, I just glared at him for a second as he lay twisted and helpless on the ground, reaching up to me.

Maybe you deserve it, I told him. I turned my back on him and began carrying Sam out of the park.

Hey! Im sorry! I didnt mean to hurt Tony! I wasnt going to drop Sam! I was bluffing! Im sorry! Ill do anything you want if you get me out of here! Ill give you everything! Please! Dont leave me alone! What was that!? Theres, theres something out here! Come back! Please! I swear that Ill do anything! Please! Pleeeaase! Come back! His voice faded quickly, and the sound of rain and Sams pain resumed. As I walked, the feeling of that presence faded as well.

I had almost a mile to go in the rain before there would be a house with a phone, and Sam was moaning and wincing practically with every step. I made slow, frustrating progress for a few hundred yards before I slipped and landed heavily on my left knee. Sam screeched in my ear after his upper chest his my shoulder.

I think I broke a rib back there! You cant carry me like this! I didnt know how he could have broken a rib and only started to feel it now but I wasnt about to argue. As carefully as I could in my anxiety, I placed him on the ground in a sitting position and switched the carrying style to firefighter carrying style so that he was mostly over my shoulder.

Is that better? I asked him when Id hoisted him back up. He had winced again as I held him up.

It still hurts, but its better. We rounded a curve on the trail and were approaching a fairly gentle slope where the parking lot was situated. I thought of it then as the end of the park. Sam had begun to feel easier to carry, so I felt then Id be able to make it out of this forest.

I remember that since Id been in the park many times before, and even with another scout on my back being carried like this who was constantly voicing his pain, things were coming back to normal. Whatever feeling Id experienced over where I had thought Tony disappeared was going away. Things began to feel so normal that the idea Tony had just gotten up and walked away and emergency services would soon find him was believable. I guess what I felt then was that all I had to do was carry Sam and then it would be up to the adults to take care of all this.

Oh Jesus, Sam suddenly said quietly. Run. Run! Run! Fucking Run! Before I could ask or turn to see what I was to run from, he struck me as hard as he could on the side. He did this again and again, even after I started running. It was difficult to run even a few steps with such a heavy, awkward weight. It became easier when I noticed something that was already too familiar: Sams voice became quieter even as he thrashed and screeched more shrilly on my back. He might have said what it was or described anything about it, but within seconds he was as muted as my silent steps in the puddles on the pathway.

I reached the bottom of the incline. Sam was convulsing then, which I felt was a sign that whatever I was trying to flee was getting closer. He was still hitting me in the side, but it was weaker and more erratically.

The path up the hill was full of loose rocks and gravel. In weather like this it was impossible to keep a solid foothold, but by some miracle I was able to run up it and maintain a hold on him even as he practically seemed to be trying to break free and I was trembling. I remember thinking that I faintly heard something then, something like a splash. That had to be a good sign.

Halfway up the hill I felt a horrible sensation in my feet. They were going numb. I remember not understanding why, and even with all the momentum I had built up, my feet landed awkwardly, like Id slipped on ice but still landed on my feet. I barely had time to feel pain in my ankles because they went numb as well. I was barely able to stumble forward before the numbness climbed up to my knees. My legs were useless then. I fell forward practically face first.

Sam got free even with his fractures, flipped over, and crawled up the hill. I tried myself. I could feel the numbness had reached my ribcage by then, but dragged myself across the rocks. I remember perfectly the sight of Sam dragging himself too while twitching and trembling as he crawled.

A force hit the back of my head that felt like a construction beam dropped from a crane. My face went into the ground, rocks stabbing into my cheeks hard enough to break the skin and I seemed to lose all fight and flight instinct. I just lay there like a breathing corpse. Even if I hadnt been numb I didnt have any energy, any hope, any understanding of what was happening to me. I didnt even have the courage to lift my hood up and see what was happening around me.

I dont know how long I lay there. The numbness left me, but I still didnt lift my hood. So little light was coming in under my hood that night might have fallen and I wouldnt have been able to tell. A long time later, the rain stopped. A longer time after that, I began to hear again. I heard birds tweeting, cars driving by from what sounded like miles away. I didnt move.

After a long time of only hearing the sounds of nature, I heard footsteps approaching me. They stopped suddenly, and then clearly changed to those of someone running up to me.

Are you alright? An old man whose name I dont remember said as he leaned over and pulled my hood back. I looked up at him, rocks still stabbed into my face. He winced as he saw it. Christ, kid. What happened to you?

I dont know, I said.

I still dont know. I dont want to. I know that Eric, Tony, and Sam were never found, nor was any trace of anything that might have made them disappear. I learned even that reluctantly. Look for answers? Hell, I dont even go near forests any longer.
Staying away from forests isnt enough. I have developed a need for sound. Always. After a minute without the hearing something, I feel anxious. Sleeping without it is impossible. If whatever got my fellow scouts comes for me, I want as much warning as I can get.

That brings me to the reason Im sharing this: Lately, even with music at full volume and me screaming my lungs out, Ive been experiencing minutes of silence. At home, at work, out driving, when Ive gone on visits, Ive been experiencing it.

Its been many years since the the end of my last camping trip, but it seems like Im about to feel that presence again. When it wants, I believe it will make me experience a silence that will never end.

 I remember the one for Scott Pilgrim being pretty dull.  




 We need to wear scarlet letters.  




 So last night I went to it for the first time in like six months. There were some extremely attractive women there and it's not a big place but since they looked about 19 and I'm 28 (and out of shape) I knew they'd really rather not be leered at by me, and "leering" when you're the creepy old guy means "looking at at all." So for an hour and a half I had to look away from these people in a fairly enclosed space. 

I don't mean to whine "boo hoo, I didn't objectify/gawk at a bunch of strangers!" or that I deserve "nice guy" points. It just becomes really awkward when you get conscious of how there are some people you really want to look at people but know the decent thing would be to not. 

I should go later when the place is cleared out.  




 Thoughtcatalog: The site that's maybe 1% better than Buzzfeed, tops.  




 Oh, it's just a rock farm? I somehow got the impression there was a joke that it was an organic rock farm.  




 Of course I'm biased, but I honestly think I would have preferred all the final designs to most of Faust's original ones, even if I'd been introduced to hers first.  









 Since jewelry=being able to become invisible or invincible, that sounds about right. 

Besides, Game of Thrones is about fighting for headpieces and furniture.  




 I think it was funnier when for Hot Fuzz he imitated Michael Caine. It was a bit more natural.  




 Crap, I got a lunch-being-by-ants cutie mark.  




 Well, thank you, but it seems odd to have someone believe in me when I'm just going to a safe place to do repetitive tasks and then sitting in a hot tub.  




 I recently learned of the graphically updated Resident Evil game. I know that since then zombies and stuff have become a bit passe and its odd, static third person camera angles clash a bit with modern standards, but to me it still worked really well. Plus I'm sure many of you know about this but I thought the little tweaks to change player expectations on when and how certain actions would happen worked.

So what other games is this being done with? Is Alone in the Dark   supposed to be rumored to be getting anything like this or that sort of thing?  




 Constantly. I have a very small scar on my wrist from when I started cutting myself once. I was cutting "morgue" style too.  









 Yeah, I'm literally going to go get a gym membership in about half an hour. It's going to feel terrible and great at the same time.  




 I am so fucking sold on this.  




 Well, cold anyway.  




 I've heard some pretty horrible domestic abuse. Consensual sex noises  are sweet music compared to that.   














 It means "very softcore porn." Like women in their underwear, bikinis, etc.  




 That's it alright. Thank you.  




 Sounds to me like more trouble than it's worth. 




 And here comes hundreds of thousands of cookies and other treats easily eatable by chopsticks to ruin Mattingly's diet.  









 Using the alias Frank Oz.  




 Done and done.  




 I'm pretty sure the q-tips up his nose book was The Tommyknockers.  




 It's a very unfunny movie in my opinion. 

It's just Night of the Living Dead with the audio swapped out with people talking about shitting, how they're gay, how Ben talks like a stereotypical black man, etc. Even if that's your poison, there's lots of short anti-comedy clips put in and it certainly stops being funny well before the movie ends.  




 Wisconsin, moving to Texas soon. I believe neither of those is marijuana friendly.  




 I was watching some documentary about Incels awhile ago (I have completely forgotten the title and it's too late to look it up now) and at one point someone says Incels have never seen a vagina so they only look at cheesecake porn. Then there's a montage of incel guys being disgusted by porn. 

They're just hamming it up, right? Even as a preteen, I saw a vagina in a magazine once and I found it mildly unpleasant but I certainly didn't retch and turn away the way a bunch of the guys in the movie did.  




 And then someone dialed the number while getting out their gun. 




 I have never smoked or been in close proximity to someone who was smoking marijuana that I'm aware of. I have heard numerous times that certain movies are better on weed. I've heard this said about all sorts of comedies, nature documentaries, art films, etc. How does it improve the experience? 

I frankly don't know how to acquire weed and even if I did I'd be too nervous to get it, so it's not really on the table for me to find out first hand. 

 




 Is that a common thing that gets heavily moderated? Are there 4chan raids? I know I've seen a handful of people daring people to convince them not to kill themselves, but I don't recall off the top of my head anyone being told to do that.  




 I never enjoyed parties in the slightest. I ranted before about how drinking and being drunk did fuck all to help me feel better and other than that it was just people standing or sitting around chatting. If there was live entertainment than it was people standing or sitting around yelling. I don't think they begin to live up to the hype.  




 Okay, fine, I don't like those movies. 

Leave the money on my nightstand.  




 Because they know you're likely to not feel secure enough to treat them badly back?  





























 Was this under "Medical?" 




 Back when he was just starting to look creepy.  




 I haven't since I no longer had any overdue payments.  









 So did RedLetterMedia shit this meme into the world or were they just riding a bandwagon?  














 I know a couple guys who'd I'd collaborated on a few projects with online  and they just had children. I know they should be the ones worrying about me as the alone fetishist aged virgin, but I know at least one of them is struggling with his choice profession and Jesus are kids ever  expensive, time-consuming, and very often a hardship that could very easily lead to a tragic end. 

Of course part of this worrying might be a contributor to my FA status.  




 You have no fucking rights. We made em up. Like the Boogey Man.

 Going around accidentally dropping furniture on dragons.  




 These terrible franchises are crossbreeding? Okay.  




 What are there for nominees?  




 You're pissed that even with all your alt accounts being used to upvote it this thread isn't doing too well on /r/movies, aren't you?  




 These cartoons always seemed to me like a weird combination of trying too hard and being half-assed. 




 "Watch out, Twily! She's Irish!"  




 All these moments will be lost in time. Like sisters in the rain.  









 I have really tried. I've had beer, wine, liquor, schnapps, even moonshine and it all tasted fucking horrible. Just painful to drink. And I didn't experience any euphoria, I just felt queasy and had a headache when I forced down enough that I should have been drunk. I sure as fuck didn't feel any more confident or like I could pick up a prostitute on the stuff let alone like someone with the least bit of game. 

Maybe it's psychological since I had a violent drunk dad, but whatever. It has nothing to do with thinking I'm a "special snowflake" as I'm sure someone would have accused me of for hating alcohol.  
I'm also not offering this up as an excuse for why I'm an aged virgin, but I'm sure also it doesn't help.  




 I'm renewing my gym membership on Monday because they're running a special! It's happening, it's happening! 




 My mother doesn't seem to mind. Ever since dad died a year and a half ago and I moved in with her, she's made no attempt to date or anything, so my being around prevents her from being pretty much FA too.  




 Maybe I should hire a prostitute there just to say I did it, but I'm sure if anyone knew they'd tell me that doesn't count.  




 I only read the comic instead of watching the movie so someone please tell me: Is he invincible and perfect in the movie too? Because that eventually made the book feel lazy, boring, and pretentious to me.  









 Bit of a downer though, and who needs those on this subreddit?  




 Because Cracked doesn't care about reader feedback as long as they gets clicks. 

The fact seemingly anyone could write the ATB articles which get views because they rely solely on mentioning celebrities seems to be irrelevant.  




 Do you do coloring, texture work, tweening, or what? 

Also, are those separate departments?  




 Please tell me to get over my phobias so that I can get over all my phobias.  




 The year of this story? 2016!!!!!!!!!! 




 Blue Ruin. I know a lot of people find it boring, but there was something about what an awkward revenge movie it was that was captivating.  









 "Can you expand on this"

Nice subtle pun. 

Anyway, for me, it's cartoons being literally hooked up to pumps, air tanks, whatever, and floating or bouncing around. As ridiculous as it might sound, characters being drawn becoming fat does nothing for me. 

Obviously this is impossible in the real world and when people photoshop it happening to real humans, I personally find it unpleasant but I don't really begrudge them for it. 

 









 4. She thinks you're kidding and jokingly says something like "Sure thing stud."

 I mean Davos. He's well-played and a compelling character, but it seemed like a bit of a cheat that he survived the wildfire explosion when he was so near he could see wildfire leaking out the back of the ship. With him dying, it seemed to give more resonance to the fleet being destroyed and it gave more of a human face to all the people that died in that scene. As is, the main character we've gotten to know who died at that battle was Davos's son, who was kind of one-note and unlikable.  




 Like, how did the Soviet news report on their involvement in Vietnam? Did they deny it on their news? Did they say "Yeah, we're doing all this and it's justified for the following reasons"? Did they have televised debates about things? If yes, we're they completely loaded debates?  

 




 Honestly, even as a kid, I remember thinking that bikes looked cooler than big wheels. But having since become very familiar with how uncomfortable bike seats are, I would be open to trying a design more like a big wheel these days.  




 No shotgun?

 You were right. 
 




 "This is the kind of kid we grind up to use for the additives in your Lunchables."  




 Eh, it's just the few suicidal people throwing the averages off.  









 I'm not necessarily saying it's the deepest movie in the world, but when people praise Tree of Life (2011) for being like this really transcendent and the like, I assume they'd be able to explain why. But when I saw it, all I thought was "This is pretty! I like the music! That looks pretty too! Oh, this is moody!" I'm basically like a stoned six year-old when I watch that thing. 

You have any that do that for you?   




 I thought for sure this was going to turn out to be a man wearing prosthetics.  














 Skip the scene where Tarantino is rambling, though.  




 AAUAUAAAGGGGGHHHH!

 Dude, we've seen Arya lose every time she holds up a sword against an armed opponent on equal footing and we've seen Brienne get rough and tumble while moving pretty fast. She could keep up with Jamie (admittedly when he was rusty but he was still probably in better shape than Arya.)

 He ain't about to bite the Canadian Film Board's hand, though.  




 Like my next thing in mind is a guy who sort of goads the comment section a bit, so what are the rules for that? And another one is about a main character who's a white supremacist, what would be the policy for that?  




 That's it! Thanks! 




 Shame you didn't have a gopro on.  




 Nope. We needed to put Legolas and company in. No time in the nine hours for those guys.  




 When the hell was this movie witty? It was as broad as it gets.

 It's not really that impressive to have that much saved up by 28 if you don't do anything with your life except your job, but thank you for the compliment.  




 I was just watching Interstellar with my brother and he described to me afterwards how towards the end, he was thinking "end! End!" I asked him if what was happening was bad or uninteresting or something, and he said no, but he just felt like the movie should be over. 

I really don't get people watching movies like they have to be film critics. I don't care if a scene doesn't drive the plot forward or if the "peaks and valleys" aren't timed out properly or whatever. I care how interesting the scene I'm watching is or if there's a likelihood based on previous scenes whether it will become interesting. That might say more about me than it does movies, but it just seems like caring about a movie's pace is just giving yourself a reason not to like it.  









 Suppose someone somehow got onto live television on that sort of show and delivered a rant similar to the one Bing Madsen delivers and then kills themselves, and it either airs or someone recorded it with a phone and then leaked it. How do you imagine you would react if you were watching? 









 I've lived in the same town for twenty-eight years. I've wanted to move for a long time but my livelihood is pretty tied to my location and the place I most want to move to isn't hiring in that field (I checked their local job listings.) I make a couple thousand off stuff I do online and have $30,000 saved up, but I've been worried it will all just crash and burn and then have to move back up here with a worse job. 

So have any of you tried moving away from a town you're tired of, considered that a problem, etc. How'd it work out?  




 Still looking forward to Chappie, though.

 




 No, or I guess I'm attached to it the way I'm attached to gum stuck to my fingers that I'm trying to flick off. I am actively working to get rid of it.   




 I read somewhere that he's supposed to have said that movies aren't ideally supposed to be "enjoyable" experiences. Can anyone confirm or deny that?
