 Worst idea ever. Bats carry and are the reason why we have most of the worst infectious diseases today.
To name the worst...
Ebola
Rabies 




 The original towers would have survived if the planes were not full of jet fuel. The resulting fire was what sealed that fate 




 This is fucking brilliant. 



























































 I'm pretty sure they're intended to be placeholder names. Once we know more about what they are and how they work we'll probably have other names for them but for now their 'true forms' are hidden from us so we call them dark.

You can view hotels by rating of their "high speed" wifi. 




 I bet she has "LOVE YOU" written on her eyelids. 




 Different countries use different decimal markers. 






















































 Thats pretty cool sitting in the box like that, but that dudes back is gotta be wrecked now. 














 Make your dream bigger, and the steps to get there smaller. 




 This is the same type of crap that gets us movies like Lucy.
We only use 10% of our brains, 8.2% of our DNA, and so forth.
Frankly DNA is still a big mystery. Lots of stuff in it is hard to figure out.
I might only use 8.2% of my keyboard most of the time, but that ALT-F4 is REALLY damn important when I'm watching disturbing porn with someone else in the house. 









 Idiots, doing idiot things ! 




 Someday, when I'm a dad, I'll really hate people like you because I'll be way to lazy to put that much effort into things. 


















































































































 Just hope that photoshop they were talking about doesn't pop up.
 



























































 You should modify your handling.dat file and then chase after them.... 




 Except for the adopted the daughter's butt!!!!!
Phew....Close call for OP. 









 You should go up and flash her. I hear it usually works when girls flash guys. 




 Someone please face swap him onto all of the silly peoples.

 It's very difficult to make an OP's mom joke about sucking when you can actually see her.
Have you tried closing your eyes? 

















































 I feel like there are so many places to put Obama's face from this picture. 




 Basically this (though I prefer ghee over cheese), but careful with too much seafood.
Heavy metal toxicity is a serious problem. 




 What's up, dog? 




 GOD DAMN that slow-mo.
If someone was recording my voice, you would've heard an "OH my god no" followed by a large inhale going "ahhhhhhhhhhh" 
































































 There is a difference between having a small penis and having a micropenis (NSFW). 










































































































































































































































 Man... In Canada (atleast in Calgary) you're obligated to shovel the side walk by your house even if it's covered in 5 feet of cold ass snow. Instead of chilling with cocoa my dad and I would be busting our asses clearing that. 




 You forgot the coca extract for the Aztec chocolate. And the ritual part where the priest rips your beating heart out of your chest 
















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































 Judges generally don't earn that much. And the $2.2m was undoubtedly spread among many judges. I think it's a combination of fear, greed and disbelief that they would ever be caught. If you receive a cash payment and there is no paper trail, only a verbal agreement, it's easy to imagine that there is very little risk of associated with the bribe.
And to be fair, this probably happens all the time, all over the world, especially among elected and lower court judged who couldn't necessarily jump to private practice and expect to paid a king's ransom. 




 Chapman was frequently late for rehearsing or recording, leading to the other Pythons calling him "the late Graham Chapman".
 

































































































































 Pretty sure Reynolds personally endorsed that image when he found it. 




 It's official. Donald Trump for President is a PR move. He's such a wingnut that the GOP marketing probably thought he'd make the other Republican candidates seem moderate.
It's funny how they underestimate Americans' ability to detect bullshit in the digital age. 




 The 47-year-old left with 15 gigabytes worth of data and information regarding human experimentation, which he felt may have crossed ethical boundaries
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they crossed a few boundaries. 









 Peer-reviewed paper published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.
 




 Yeah, it always amazes me how so many people who fall over themselves to criticize people like Thomas Jefferson, Mother Theresa, Henry Ford and so on for their faults often seem to regard Steve Jobs as a saint.
He was one of the highest profile dicks of the 20th century. He just happened to make good phones. At least, if you like screens the size of postage stamps.
 




































































































































































 Dogs are not our whole life, but they make our lives whole. 
































































 How come 90% of these articles never have pictures of the bones?

 




 These things that look like cats, but they've got these long beak-y nose things.

 










































































 One of my uncles is a Doctor. He works continuously 15 days a month, in which he works around 12 hours a day and has the other 15 days free. In that 15 days he spends time with his Wife and Children. This is how you need to adjust between your patients and family. 

 




 Find me a person that can watch Giant Douche vs. Turd Sandwich and not appreciate it.

 




 If she and her family can afford for her to not have a job for the years it would take to get to the payout point. 

 












































 For the meats I used, prosciutto, spicy capicola, dried salami and a homemade Italian sausage my friend's dad makes and dries himself. Pt de campagne au cognac, a semi-soft cheese called Noyan from local cheesemaker Fromagerie Fritz Kaiser and parmesan shavings. An onion marmalade I made myself and a bunch of fillers - olives, grapes, gherkins, nuts and dried fruit. :)
 




 Subtle Pterodactyl would be an excellent name for a band that I would hate.
 




 Gluten free diets are meant for people with Coeliac disease, which affects somewhere between 1 in 100 to 1 in 170 people. It's just another fad diet that people thought was good for you, like the fat free craze back a couple decades ago. We're all still learning about nutrition.
Edit: may want to include any type of diagnosed gluten intolerance too because my inbox is blowing up. I have no stat for that population, though.
