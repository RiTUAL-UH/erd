 Awesome, thanks.  If it turns out to be a particularly nasty bug, I'll definitely utilize that! 




 And your recommended course of action would be? 




 Any chance you could provide a link to those forums? 




 A friend asked for help "fixing" their computer.  They claim that IE won't close properly and they can't open Trend Micro.

I was thinking I would run some antivirus/antispyware scans (AVG?), and I'm definitely going to install Firefox and plead with her to use that instead.

But I'm not especially adept at troubleshooting computers, and without more details, it's hard for me to know exactly what the problem is.  I'll be going to her place tomorrow to try and help, and I was wondering if the brilliance here at reddit has some suggestions for how I should proceed.

 I was homeschooled K-12.  My last two years of high school I dual-enrolled at a community college.  This enabled me to transfer in as a sophomore right out of highschool.  I got my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering in 3 years, and I my Master's in Computer Networking in 4, all with a 3.75+ GPA.

Thanks Mom and Dad for homeschooling me! 









 Damn, I want to know if it hit the boy or not!  There's a split second where the camera loses the soda-rocket (pop-rocket if you're from up North), and I can't tell if it hits the kid or if he manages to evade it.

 Hey Reddit,
My community holds a "Senior Breakfast" for the elderly folk in the area a couple times every year.  For the next one, I've been asked to do some form of humorous entertainment (nothing too lengthy maybe 5-10min).  Now I've done some standup before, but not with this specific demographic as my audience.  So my question is, what do you think the seniors today would find funny?

Feel free to recommend specific jokes, online resources, etc.  Your thoughts are much appreciated!

 I noticed the same thing, and it seems to only be with the Webgoat demo videos. I thought perhaps they just didn't have audio to begin with... 




 I solved this by changing the port WebGoat was running on from 8080 to 80:

java -jar WebGoat-6.0.1-war-exec.jar -httpPort 80

For whatever reason Burp didn't like forwarding to localhost:[port] 




 I'm attempting the "Path Based Access Control" lesson on WebGoat, but when using Burp as a proxy I'm not able to use WebGoat. Any attempts to load a page (before or after intercepting) result in the following errors in Burp:

"Timeout in transmission from localhost"
"Timeout in communication with remote server"

All other webpages work just fine. I'm only having this issue with WebGoat on localhost. My configurations are below:

- WebGoat is running on localhost:8080
- Burp Proxy is configured to listen on 127.0.0.1:8081
- Firefox is configured to use the Burp proxy.

I've spent several hours Googling and tweaking the configurations, but I have not been able to get it to work. Any help would be appreciated.

 Since no one else wants to go there, I will.
STDs. 




 Damn it. Beat me to it... 




 Gotcha. So, by not vaccinating, you not only put yourself at risk, but everyone around you, and you do all of this for a weak "maybe" of a risk.

Doesn't seem worth it at all. 




 Yes, I've seen many references to mercury being potentially implicated in this, so you make a good point. 




 Thanks! Just did :) 




 My parents are anti-vaccinations, and I've been trying to educate myself on the matter so that I could address and potentially counter their concerns knowledgeably.

I know Reddit is quite pro-vaccine, and I hear all the time about the flawed and debunked autism-vaccine study. I watch Penn and Teller's Bullshit episode on vaccines, and I see people "poo-poo" any casual connection between vaccines and autism.

But then I come across a site like [this](http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2007/06/no-evidence-of-any-link.html), and I become confused. It appears to be heavily cited, with over 60 papers and studies that present a connection between various types of vaccines and ADS (austism spectrum disorder).

There seems to be misinformation on this topic everywhere, and it can get a little overwhelming. Reddit, can you help me sort out fact from fiction, speculation from science?

*EDIT* Whoops, forgot to include link
 




 This is great, thank you! I'm not one to take a blogger or even a study at face value, but I sometimes have a difficult time taking apart the research process like you did.

And those are great resources, I'll definitely be bookmarking those for thorough reading :) 




 I understand, but even if we assume that one is completely safe (which isn't the case) that's only a single vaccine. There are studies linking autism to the Hepatitis B Vaccination, for example.

I guess I'm just wondering if vaccination simply becomes a question of risk tolerance? "Am I okay with with the rare but possible side effects of this vaccination?" 




 Okay, so would you agree it's a case then of risk assessment? Not all vaccines are for potentially fatal diseases. 









 "If you visit a link on one computer, itll show up purple across your other computers."

Will this also be the case for mobile apps? This would greatly improve the efficiency of my toilet based reddit browsing.

"Oh shit, Titty-Sprinkles is down again"
