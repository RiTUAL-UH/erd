 It would be fucking impossible to get Taco Bell at 3 am 




 I think you're on to something here!  The CDC *is* looking pretty dumb lately.  




 For all you know I myself am a stripper, or I have children that are and support them even if I don't agree with them.
I've got an idea; How about we don't project our personal feelings on a given subject onto one another, insisting the other is wrong and we are right? Deal?
*Hint* THAT is liberalism. Live and let live. 




 I find it very irritating how often the article referred to him as "the stripper".

There's nothing wrong with stripping, but that's not all he is. 




 Nope, those are the fallen angels.
Cass is somewhere in there. 




 The things I've seen working at my copy shop (copying depositions from lawsuits and court cases mostly) have left me unable to sleep at night. I've met a few of the defendants, and I never would have known otherwise what they are guilty of. If ignorance is bliss, knowledge is a burden.  




 The biggest thing I think he's missing here is that just because his friend or people like him may not have laid a hand on an underage person, but someone else had to in order to create the content he's "harmlessly" viewing. He didn't do the abuse, but someone with a camera has to in order to catch those vile images. This perpetuates the market for such images and videos. Other sick people are fulfilling a need created by these 60 year old white guys. Cut off the demand, the supply withers and dies and no more children are harmed.

 "The 23 Slowest Snapchats Of The '80s"
I'd click it 




 When i got the job offer for my original position it included a contract stating I would get a monthly bonus based off the store's income for that month. The percentage wasn't specified, but both myself and the business owner signed it. I've been with my employer for a little over a year and a half now, have sense gotten a promotion and 2 raises but have only gotten 3 bonuses totaling $200, the last one being over a year ago. We haven't posted a single loss since I've been here, and we just wrapped up our best month of the year. Well, I get my check today and...no bonus!! This is really starting to piss me off. I've talked to the owner about it before and all I get is "yeah, we haven't been doing very well. Not a lot of profit." But as the manager I have full access to our finances and I can see that we did *worse* those few times I did get a bonus compared to our lowest month this year! How do I approach this without calling my boss a liar or cheapsake? I really need this job but I'm completely being used here.


EDIT: Thanks for the advice! I'll that those wise words and see what I can make happen :)

 That is cool as hell, I'm personally impressed!  









 All jokes aside, this is a really beautiful photo 




 This creates a lot of pressure to make a decision when I just want an apple 
























 I'm literally the only person in my family who isn't an addict of some sort, which has made me an outcast. If I want to spend time with my family, even if it's breakfast, drinking is involved. They drink and drive like it's a normal part of life. I've seen my parents loose everything, a large fortune, homes, 6 vehicles and have to move back in with my grandparents...but they kept drinking. Once at lunch I suggested my sister shouldn't be drinking and driving with my new born (3 weeks old) baby nephew in the car, and she told me to mind my business and she can do whatever the fuck she wants, then got a drink TO GO. 
Also, I grew up in a very physically, emotionally and sexually abusive household. I can never forget the things that happened. 

TL; DR:  my refusal to condone my family's lifestyle choices, and my mistreatment as a child and a teen. 




 As scary as potentially losing your ring is, that's pretty awesome!!! Nothing says progress like an item that used to fit comfortably flying off. Congratulations on your progress!!! 




 That's a good idea, I'll start looking for races in my area! I really thought I could run the whole thing but now I see that's not such a great idea. I live in Southern Louisiana so I'm sure I can run the whole Mardin Grass 5k next year, maybe more! 




 That's great advice! I can't imagine how nervous I'll be on race day, but I will try to remember to take it all in and document my time. And ill try to remember to take my time and walk if i need to. I really thought if i tried hard enough i could run the whole thing but I admit my expectations were a little unrealistic.  I've always dreamed of being a runner, so hopefully this will be my first of many races! Thank you for the advice!  




 Thank you for the concern and advice! I'm actually surprised to hear the program takes 9 weeks. For some reason I thought if I trained hard enough I could run the whole thing. Now it seems like that will lead to an injury that would take me out of the race all together. Thanks again!  




 This past summer I joined a boxing gym and fell in love with working out. I was going 3-5 times a week, started to get in great shape and felt better about myself than I ever had. But then I got injured and took some time off  from the gym. Immediately following that, I went on vacation for a week and did zero work outs. I came home with a terrible sunburn and sun poisoning, which kept me out for another week. I ended up being out for over a month. That was July, and I'm still struggling to get back into a routine, I can hardly manage getting to the gym once a week now. I've also gained weight, and I'm not 10 lbs higher than my original start weight! This is what hurts most. I worked so hard and it's all disappeared. My plan at the beginning of the year was to look better for this holiday season than I did the last. I just got married in February and wore a size 16 dress. My new goal is to be at a size 10 for my 1 year anniversary. 
The thing is, it's not even just about looks and dress sizes. Heart disease and diabetes runs on both sides of my family. I want to be healthy enough to live a long, fulfilling life with my husband and raise a family. 

To help cure myself of this, I just singed up for my first 5k. It's not much but I've never ran that far before. Given that I paid the entry fee, I'm hoping it will light a fire under me and get me back into a solid training routine. I'm so nervous but at the same time I havnt stopped smiling since I registered.

God, I hope this doesn't blow up in my face. I'm so tired of failing and starting over again.



EDIT: structure and spelling. 
EDIT 2: only a few people have commented so far but I just love how supportive this community is! Thank you all for the encouragement and advice!  




 Battlestar Galactia reboot. I can't count the number of times I've re watched it. 




 Dude, really? Is that entirely necessary?  




 Unfortunately this is completely normal here in the US 




 I'm just a socially awkward person, still new to reddit and asking a question. Didn't mean to bring down the quality of content, I was referred to another sub that is more fitting.  




 Didn't know about this subreddit! Thanks for the link, hopefully I can learn a thing or two. 




 Don't forget to hold hands and look both ways

 I never even enrolled into college mostly because I wasn't willing to go so far into debt when I know I could learn through autodidacticism. I realized I was into graphic design, so I got a job as a personal assistant to a designer and ended up doing a lot of her work. With that experience I was able to get a great job as a graphic designer and have been there for 2 years. Meanwhile, I take online classes at my leisure. I get certificates of completion if I pass the class, which I can use on my resume. 

I do sometimes regret not getting the college experience and wonder what I missed out on learning wise, but overall I have no regrets. Hard lessons learned are not easily forgotten. 


For those interested: I use edx.com and courseusa.com to take classes. The ones I take are free by choice, but you can pay for the class to get a validated certificate and credits. I'm currently taking an epidemiology class from professors at Penn State,  and  soon i am starting an advanced astronomy class.  




 "Start changing your life now. The time will pass regardless."

Yes, and not just for myself but for any fellow ladies who happen to be without one in a time of need. I would give me greatest enemy a tampon if she needed one.
NEVER deny a woman a tampon. 
























 I known exactly what you mean, I recently gained 40 pounds and cried while getting dressed for Christmas today. I missed thanksgiving because I was so embarrassed  my weight gain. Today I felt defeated and sorry for myself but eventually I found something I felt mildly comfortable wearing and promised myself I would do whatever it took to make sure I didn't feel this way next christmas. 
Just make the choice to make 2015 different. You've lost the weight before, you can do it again, you just have to Crack down and commit to it.  




 Thank you so much for the advice. I used to track my food, like 2 years ago, and it worked wonders. I don't know why I never tried it again, but you're absolutely right. I'm just guessing at my diet, assuming I'm making the right choices, but I'm probably not. I'm going to download MFP tonight and start fresh in the morning. Thank you again!  




 Wow that makes so much sense I wonder how the thought never occurred to me before! Thank you VERY much for that insight, I'll look into that avenue more. 




 Actually I've been considering switching switching for some time now. I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety  (used to be VERY prone to anxiety attacks) at 16 (11 years ago) and first tried Paxil. That made me so much worse. My self harming increased and I became more suicidal. My doc at the time took me off of that and put me on Lexapro. It worked well enough, and I've been too scared to try anything else because of my experience with Paxil. But I'm thinking more and more it's time to try something new. There are so many signs that say this just isn't the right thing for me. 




 Im a 27 year old female, 5'2". March of this year I was 185lbs. I joined a boxing club and was instantly obsessed. I was doing great going 3-5 days a week and I actually gained a couple of pounds because of muscle but I dropped a dress size and I was in GREAT shape, but more importantly I felt great about myself. 
I started this gym to try to help my depression in an un-medicated fashion but it didn't help, so in June I got back on Lexapro. Since then I've gone from 187 to 215. I've been at 215 for about 2 months now. I know the medicine is the main cause for the weight gain but I'll admit I'm having trouble getting into the gym for months now. Injuries, illness, I  didn't have a car for a full month, and my job kept me away so I got into the habit of just not going. Right now I go about once a week. I want so badly to go more but this is my busiest time of year at work and I just can't get the time in. 

I don't know if I'm writing this for support, advice, or to just get it off of my chest. I'm just so damn frustrated it's moving me to tears. I don't recognize myself in the mirror anymore. NONE of my clothes fit. None. I'm at the highest weight I've ever been in my life and I have so much work to do to get back to where I started this year it feels impossible. 




 I was at an indoor range shooting my Sig p226 and a spent shell bounced off the side of my lane and straight down my shirt. That's the day I learned ladies  shouldn't wear V-neck shirts while shooting. 




 Fuck. That.
Have you ever had a hot, freshly  spent shell fly down your shirt and land on your breasts? I have. Still have the scar after 5 years. 




 This might be a little long, but here goes...

My husband and I lived next door to an elderly couple, the wife was sick and dying and the husband was an alcoholic/drug addict/drug dealer. He would use and deal his dying wife's meds in his driveway or right in the street. We should have known there was going to be problems because he told us he's glad "a nice white couple moved in" because he's tired of "living next to worthless niggers."
One night soon after we moved in, he was banging on our door at 3 am saying someone was trying to break into his house. My husband went over there with a gun and made sure the place was clear but the old man kept him there till 5 am. This happened 2 more times before my husband just said "it's not my problem, call the cops".

Here's the worst night; my husband called at 1 am to say he was almost home from the rig. Shortly after, I heard banging on the door. Thinking it was my husband and he forgot his keys I opened the door without checking. It was the old man, high as hell and  holding a machettee, saying he saw someone in my yard trying to break into the other side of my house. I grab the Sig Sauer, call 911, and go search the yard, finding nothing. Cops get there, arrest him because it's the 5th similar incident of the day. He's sent to a mental hospital and his poor sick wife is left alone and evicted. 




 Inception and The Dark Knight. 
Fantastic soundtracks.  




 I relate so much to the second dog so much it hurts 




 My best friend in high school was horrified of butterflies. I always thought she was full of shit, till one day in the park one flew near her and she dropped to the ground screaming and crying. Took forever to calm her down. 




 My college roommate (also my best friend since 3rd grade) brought home a girl he met in math class. She and I became fast friends (im a girl). They fell in love and we became the 3 muksateers. He committed suicide a few months later. She and I survived because we had each other. Still best friends 7 years later. 




 The most beautiful game I've ever played and you captured it well! Great work! 




 Me too! It was amazing. He's amazing!. 




 *insert Harvey Birdman laugh here*
If I had gold to give, it would be yours. I love puns. 




 My husband and I were at a friend's destination wedding in the mountains a few years ago, and we got into an argument after the rehearsal dinner. Seeing as I was the maid of honor with a wedding to control the next day,  and it was like 1 am, I left him outside to smoke a cigar and went to bed. Next thing I know at 3 am and he's in my ear telling me to look up. I roll over, the room is pitch black save for the dozens of fireflies. He knew I'd never seen them before,  so he spent 2 hours in the dark catching them by hand, then released them in our room at the cabin. 

Next to our wedding, that was the best night of my life. 
























 Sorry but I don't think it would work. Think of the group Pussy Riot out of Russia. I hear that on news outlets regularly and the anchors say it without hesitation. 









 Meh. Probably a 4.
Two days ago I was laid off a month shy of my 2 year anniversary with the company and Im pretty deeply in debt from medical bills.
BUT I have a wonderful husband with a solid job that can briefly support us while I find another job. 




 Lol that is pretty weird, but hey whatever works!! I'm up for giving it a try.
Trying on jeans and standing in front of the mirror are two things that I do from time to time and they work in a really unfortunate way. 
The night I posted this my husband was working late and I did miss him, so maybe there's some truth to that. I'll let him know it's his fault ASAP. 




 You're right, one little slip up is not going to make me lose all my progress. In the past I always overreated to things like this in the past and gave up. I'm working on that.  




 Thank you, that's great advice!! I actually did spend some time on the living room floor doing double sit ups and push ups to feel better about it. I also logged it like you said, and it turns out it didn't negatively impact my day nearly as bad as I feared. I guess I just overreated. Tomorrow is a new day! 




 That makes so much sense, thank you for the advice! I'm definitely the type of person to go down the road and get a treat at the gas station if I remove everything from the house. 




 I'm having the hardest time with cravings after eating well all day. I've been logging everything I eat and following my macros on MFP. Today at lunch I even got a free chocolate chip cookie the size of my hand, and I resisted eating it and ate only my planned meal.

Later in the afternoon I started to break down and went to find the cookie where I left it. Luckily my coworker threw it away, preventing me from eating it. But as soon as I got home from work, the hunt began. I found some peanut butter chocolate leftover from Christmas and even ate some chocolate sprinkles out of desperation. All the while reading articles online about how to overcome sugar and carb addictions. I didn't put the candy down, I finished every bite while reading about portion control and overcoming cravings.

I'm afraid of logging what I just did to find out how much I threw off my day. It would have been my best day this week, but I completely screwed it up. What can I do to control and overcome these intense cravings? 




 Sorry for the late reply I tried to figure out how to find players on the website and I couldn't. Also I'm still very new to reddit and I have no idea how to PM but feel free to inbox me!! 




 I joined Chris   Heidi Powell ' s diet bet that official begins today, Jan 5th. You bet $30 that you can lose 4% of your body weight in 30 days. All the winners split the pot. 
If anyone is participating I'd love to follow you on the website throughout the month! 




 This is actually exactly what I'm needing right now. No judgement, just support. Someone who knows how this feels. 




 Fonts. Fucking fonts  




 "The best way to get over someone old is to get under someone new!"
No. Just...no. Deal with your shit, learn something from it, and try again later. 




 The day my best friend told me he was moving out of our house, I wish I would have talked him out of it. He killed himself in his new apartment leas than a month later. Turned out he planned it pretty far in advance but I feel like I could have saved his life if I had tried harder to make him stay. 




 Louisiana accents are never right. 
True Blood is like nails on a fucking chalk board in terms of bad accents, and north Louisiana looks nothing like that.  




 Constantly pointing out how much he hated drama, couldn't stand liars, and absolutely hated cheaters. I was young and stupid, he was older and hot so I believed him. He turned out to be all of that and so much worse. Cheating, lying, drug abuse, etc. 
I've learned that if someone has to constantly point out how upstanding their character is, the exact opposite is most likely the truth. Good character speaks for itself and doesn't need constant verbal reinforcement.  
























 Wow this is exactly what I needed! Thank you so much for the in depth advice, I'm going to employ it as best as I can. It reminds me of some bad advice a friend gave me...she got on me cause I said I would "try", and by doing that I am deliberately setting myself up for failure and giving myself after way out. as you said, I'd rather be prepared for the inevitable slip-up than promise to NEVER mess up again and hate myself when I do.

Thank you again. As soon as my situation allows I'll try to find someone in my area who can help! 




 Middle of South Louisiana? I do believe we may be in the same area! Go cajuns? 




 Damn I didn't know that! Thanks for the info!! 




 Thank you, I appreciate the advice! I'll definitely check out that sub and try to get some help. 




 Man people are fucking jerks. Ignore them, your dog is cute as hell. 




 This is really impressive but every time I see intricate work like this, I imagine getting really irritated at the Caff cause I just want my damn coffee but the barista had a vision and damn it they will see it through! 




 Wow humans are fucking gross 




 Damn I'm an meat eater all the way but this has some sarah mclachlan-level guilt tripping skills. 




 Best of luck with your recovery! Therapy isn't an option at the moment. I'm unemployed, don't have insurance, and my husband makes too much to get any kind of assistance. Thank you for the adcive, maybe soon I'll be able to use it :) 




 I'm with you 100%. Working out in the morning is absolutely not an option for me. I had to get into that auto pilot mindset. Don't think about doing it, just shut your brain down, drive to them gym, get changed and get started. After working out like 15 mins you just decided "I'm here and doing it, might as well get it done!". Do that enough and it will become habit, like when you have a day off but find yourself accidentally driving to work anyway? It's just like that.
You can do this!! You know you can, you just have to get out of your own way. 




 (I don't even know if this is the right thread so sorry if it isnt.)

My husband has noticed this behavior, too.
For example, today I finished up a Diet Bet and won, so my husband wanted to celebrate with eating ANYTHING I wanted for dinner. I opted for pizza. I got my own large stuffed crust pizza and after restricing ate the whole goddamn thing by myself.
I felt so so shitty afterwards, and if I hadn't recently gotten my wisdom teeth pulled I fear would dislodge the blood clots, I would have purged. I've never done this before and couldn't cause vomiting would have caused the blood clots to dislodge.


Anyway I do shit like this sometimes. I don't want to claim I have a problem with a restriction and binging cycle, I don't want give myself excuses or be dramatic about overeating when other people have serious problems...I just can't tell and I don't have the funds to see a professional about this.

Anyone have any tips or resources they're willing to share so I can get my shit together? I'm going to start another diet bet tomorrow and I don't want to keep doing this to myself. I just keep self-sabotaging and getting in my own way.

EDIT: Was missing the majority of a clarifying sentence. Oops. Posting on mobile is hard. 




 I'm with you. Public shaming and bullying your kid is just going to fuck them up and probably turn them into a jerk and a bully, having learned it's an acceptable way to deal with people. 




 I box! It's excellent for getting out the aggression and bad feelings. Title Boxing is a great place to start if you're interested.  




 This is me 100% and the biggest thing that's helped me is DietBet. Bet $30 you can lose 4% of your body weight in a month, and you split the pot with everyone else who did the same. The bet I'm currently in has a pot of almost  $375,000. I just ask myself "do I want cookies or money? Do I want to watch Netflix instead of working out, or do I want the cash?"
I heard a radio interview of some guy winning  $400 from a DietBet, and I just lost my job so it's a HUGE motivation for me. I plan just keep doing dietbets till the habit sticks without the money.  




 That's a good point, makes me think about the controversy when Brittney Spears released If U Seek Amy. A lot of people had a big problem with that. 




 Man that makes the band name so much better. A riot of kittens. Kitten Riot.  





























 This actually moved me to tears. Absolutely beautiful. 




 Dude, don't worry too much about that. It really is about the couple. My husband and I have been together for 9 years on the 25th and I make it an active point to give him blowjobs on the regular, usually during my period. I initiate them, and they're only for him. He returns the favor when I'm off, so the cycle of giving goes round and round. 




 Awesome!! I discovered Diet Bet because I follow Chris Powell from the tv show Extreme Weight Loss on Facebook. Apparently he and his wife host like 3 bets a year, and he posted on his FB page that the New Year bet was starting in a few hours. I researched it as much as possible, the FAQ and game rules have a lot of good info so I strongly recommend that you check those out. After I read everything I could, I paid the $30 buy-in knowing that I had 7 days to change my mind. The sign-up process is very straight forward, it can all be done through the website or the mobile app.

The motivation doesn't come from "oh I am going to get SO MUCH MONEY!" like you would expect, but I am stingy and wanted my $30 back lol. Mostly just know I had *very* clear goals in mind is what kept me in line. I got MyFitnessPal and followed my macros, and submitted unofficial weigh-ins weekly on the app. You're only required to do two official weigh ins on the day the bet starts the day it ends, but when you update weekly it tells you total pounds   ounces lost, how any you have to go till your goal weight and how many days till the final weigh in. It sounds so simple but having it spelled out like that in black   white was really critical for my success. 
You can join any bet within 7 days after the starting date, so if you want to join the one  I'm in now I'd be happy to send you the link.
I hope this answers your question and gives you more insight into the process!  




 Eating disorders alone are hard to get support for cause people don't take is seriously. Being a man and having an ED...that sounds impossible to people, like how people think men can't be raped. Men struggle too, all the time.

I think it's incredible you were able to overcome all of that seemingly on your own. You don't have to do it alone anymore, there's an entire community here willing to support you. Any time you feel like you're slipping, hit me up and I'll do whatever I can to help you out. 




 My first Diet Bet wrapped up yesterday. I bet $30 I could lose 4% of my body weight in 28 days. I lost 9 pounds,  making the cut by 1 ounce and won back $42! Because I was employed at the time I did my first bet and wasn't ready to stop the progress yesterday, instead of cashing out I used the winnings as credit to buy into another game. 

True that I had some anxiety in the says leading up to the last weigh in, but for the whole month I was VERY motivated to stay on track and keep up with my food log.

If things keep going this way, I can easily see myself continuing to do bets till I get closer to my goal weight as a way to develop solid habits and give myself a better reward other than food. 

If anyone joins I'd be happy to make a team and keep in touch!! 




   Binging, unless you purge, is laughed at by professionals

That's just sad, as if an eating disorder can only occur with both B   P. But that's exactly what I was afraid of people saying - that my problem last night wasn't real because I wasn't able to purge because of my surgery.

You're right, I can't reward myself with food. Logically I know it's not healthy to have that type of relationship with food, but it's so hard to let go of that mindset. I'll let you know how it goes when I figure THAT part out. 

Chin up, best of luck on your road to recovery and fitness, and thank you for your support. 




 It's so rare to hear something like that, most people scoff at these types of things. Thank you for the validation and support! 




 Thank you that makes me feel a ton better! I got used to immediate backlash in other subs, so I was worried. This really is the best subreddit I've ever seen. Thank you so much for your kind words and support! 




 Hell yeah, that's awesome! Keep it up, you got this! 




 Reddit - World's Best Clairvoyants Able to Detect if a Stranger is a Parent or Not 




 True that most kids just pratice willfull defiance and cover their asses but eventually most children will realize the stupid thing they want to do isn't worth the consequences. Every kid is different - each kid needs individualized child rearing - but humiliation is not a form of child rearing. It's just crule. 




 I just imagined OP trying to throw the snow back up into the sky. 




 Nah that's just parenting. Teaching a kid cause and effect, and that actions have negative consequences. That's totally different from humiliation. 




 Exactly! People forget they aren't just raising kids. They are shaping and molding a future adult and it's their job to make sure the kid isn't going to be a shitty adult. It's a terrible cycle. 




 Hell yeah, Geaux Cajuns!  
























 sounds pretty easy, thanks! I'll pick up some tablets tomorrow :) 




 Shit. Well, to be honest I wasn't paying attention to protein at ALL today, only carbs and nothing else. But I'm going to re-calculate because according to MPF, the tacos with lettuce shells I had for dinner came in at 136g of protein. Thanks for the info, I'll be sure to be more careful going forward. 




 Thank you for the info and the support! Today I did pretty good on water, I'm looking into how to more adequately supplement electrolytes. I definitely do not want to feel that flu at work! 




 yes? Unless I put something into MFP very, very wrong. Numbers are:
Goal: 70
Total: 205
Left: -135 




 Awesome, thanks for the response! But I didn't pay any mind to protein at all today. I'm over by 135, is that bad? 




 I'm almost 600 calories over for the day, yet I have 7g of carbs left to consume. Is it a problem if I'm under? How important is it to meet my carbs for the day? Do I need to consume something else to match my daily allotment?

EDIT: I figured out my protein problem!! I did some meal prepping and ate some of that for dinner. I accidentally included *all* of the ground beef I used instead of just what I ate tonight. Thank you all for your input and advice. Without you guys, I wouldn't have given it a second thought otherwise because I'm pretty clueless about nutrition.

EDIT 2: I fixed the info in MFP and while I'm still over for the day because of my lunch (steak and seared shrimp), I'm *so much closer!* 




 4 simultaneous tooth abscesses for about 10 months. I went to the dentist for the first time in my life about a year ago at 26 years old. I got 3 root canals and all 4 wisdom teeth removed, but one of the root canals failed causing another abscess and I got 3 dry sockets from my wisdom teeth at the same time.
The pain was unreal, and no amount narcotics helped. Couldn't eat, drink, sleep, or talk. I never want to feel that again. 









 Thank you so much, you are incredible! I'll let you know how it works 




 I'm using Open Office rather than Excel, could that cause formatting problems? I'm getting Error Code 508 under the"Row" column, and the shopping list doesn't auto-populate, it's all grayed out. 




 No just any tea, try Yerba Mate. It's got 85mg of caffeine per fluid ounce, so it's sure to give you the fix you're looking for! 




 I am so, so sorry you're feeling this way. I did a similar thing the last couple of days. My husband keeps me in check, but he's gone for work and since he's left I've gotten totally out of control. I curse myself while taking another bite of pizza or cookie.
I strongly recommend you check out /r/EOOD/, it's a sub just for people who are in the process of getting physically healthy while fighting mental issues, mainly depression. It's by far my favorite sub, just for the support and understanding. 




 I see it as gold and white, my brain only processes it and black and blue when I don't look directly at the dress but rather at the lower left corner of the photo. 




 Yeah ive gotten that email before. 
"Hi friend, I hope this email finds you well. 
 I'm in Nigeria and am in desperate need of money. If you could help me out I will reward you handsomely." 




 You have just made so much sense out of many years of pain, remorse, confusion, guilt and fear. I went through a very similar situation as the man above, but in at two personal cases the men were between 4 and 6 years older than me and both close relatives. Still, you unknowingly helped so many people like myself. I can't express how much your words have helped me, and if you were infront of me right now I would hug you and cry. Thank you a million times.  




 Considering you're experiencing high anxiety before the gym it's more likely it's tied to that, but if the two events are unrelated it could be exercise - induced asthma. 
























 You're right, there absolutely are flaws in the system and the US desperately needs a better health care system but I don't believe for a moment this is the right fix.

Regardless of how we personally disagree, there's no doubt people have had their insurance canceled and their doctors don't take ACA, and certainly a lot of people like me who simply cannot afford it. People like myself aren't taking to the Internet to lie about our experiences. I was laid off late last year because the company I worked for was failing and couldn't afford my salary, I got on unemployment and still had to pay almost $700 in penalties because of ACA. Passing it hasn't helped me one bit. 




 It's great that you've had a positive experience with ACA, but that doesn't negate the negative experiences that others are having.

I couldn't afford insurance then, and I can't afford it now. I took the hit on my taxes cause it was much cheaper than paying just a few months worth of coverage. Just because you can say you've never seen it happen doesn't mean it's not happening. I haven't personally seen the annexation of Crimea, I've never held a billion dollars, I don't know anyone who's won the lottery, but all of those exist, can happen or have happened. 

The other side of it is the affect it's having on doctors. My uncle is a doctor with his own pratice, and the ACA is killing him financially. It's taking months to get reimbursement from an ACA plan, which means he's basically working for free and doesn't have any money to cover overhead like everyday operations costs. 




 Congrats, that's so awesome!! I can't wait to get to that point, too. How long have you been on keto? 




 "Fuck it, I'm coming home"
well, that's not very encouraging! 




 That's awesome, great job!! I hope I can get to that point one day.  




 Thank you so much!  




 Thank you!! It must be very difficult traveling that much and sticking to Keto. How do you manage it? 




 It's actually a relief to read this. I'm on day 2 and I know I'm not going to see weight loss *yet*, but I'm fearful of being the rare person to not lose any. Reading all the success stories can almost seem too good to be true, so it's nice to know that if one falters, it's worthwhile to stick with it.
Thank you for sharing your experience!! 




  Its day two on Keto. My husband and I are traveling a bit today, so the only decent road lunch option was McDonald's. I got a bacon cheeseburger wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun (no side), and my husband got a large fry with his meal.

The thing is, potatoes are my *obsession.* Fries, tots, hashbrowns, baked, scalloped...you name, I would destroy it.

He ate not even half of the box, and usually I'd finish them off after eating my own large fry, but today? Today I ignored everything in my body that screamed FINISH HIM in a Mortal Combat voice. I balled up my trash, stuffed it in the fry box and threw it all out.
I'm so stupidly proud of myself. Self - restraint is not one of my strengths by any stretch of the imagination, but maybe I can do this after all!!

EDIT: Goodness, I love this community. Every time I post here I get so much encouragement, support, and direction. Thank you, you guys rock :) 




 True but that's a totally different situation. I will gladly give help to someone, anyone in need. But not someone asking for help because "they get X, I should get Y." 




 Sorry, no magic here!! I made them at home, using nutritiondata.com for the nutritional content, but I put into MPF that I used *all* 2 pounds in 1 taco, then x how many tacos I ate. I feel like such a dope! I fixed it and I'm still over for the day because I had steak for lunch, but it's *so much closer!* 




 I figured it out!! I did some meal prepping and ate some of that for dinner. I accidentally included *all* of the ground beef I used instead of just what I ate tonight.  




 Thank you! I certainly hope you're right, cause if this keeps happening I could easily see myself getting frustrated and giving up. 




 That makes me feel way better, there's no way I ate a whole pound of meat in those tacos. I'll look into it and see where I can find the mistake, and I'll be vigilant of weighing everything instead of relying on food I search for on MPF's database. 




 I'm not using a scale yet, it will be in tomorrow. I'm gonna crunch some more numbers and see what's up cause MPF is saying the tacos alone were 136g. I thought it sounded wrong when I saw the amount of calories they supposedly are, especially because I used lettuce shells. 




 Again, thank you! I ordered a scale, it'll be in tomorrow. I did seriously over do it on meat today. I had steak, seared shrimp then lettuce-shelled tacos. This was definitely a big lesson, I won't let this happen again.
