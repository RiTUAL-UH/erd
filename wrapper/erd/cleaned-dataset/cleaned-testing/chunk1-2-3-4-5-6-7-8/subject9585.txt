 What if you're sitting on on right before the spikes pop up. Ouch 




 First of all... Those are counterfiet gummy bears. Disappointing

 Why does Sheldon look like a zombie 




 God dammit OP  




 Someone wrap him up and send him to my house.  




 Frobama 




 We must get Obama to say "Michelle, WHERE IS MY SUPERSUIT."  




 Twist; OP is a karmawhore 




 Faith in OP; restored
 




 Rape face 




 Matrix 




 Scooby looks high as fuck 




 TL;DR. I'd still think it's ironic  




 Adorable! 




 Well? Did she call? 




 Sweet bowl bro 




 Bro. Spiders are fucking scary 




 I'm so sorry, Toby looks like a sweetheart. 3  




 I was gonna upvote because you said to downvote, but alas, I have realized your tricks. Downvote for you sir

 Has Reddit seriously become Facebook?

 I'm a girl 




 Best I can do is $ 4.99 




 Marcussss 3

 hm. well.. I think if you smiled a bit, it would bring out your eyes a bit more

edit: then again, what the hell do I know 




 http://i.imgur.com/j5ZYK.gif 




 this is like when people post pictures like "step one: like this page. step two: comment the number 1 step three: watch what happens to the picture!" and there are ~1K comments only with the number 1.  




 TL;DR  




 repost.  




 oh my god. if you're gonna repost, at least wait A DAY before reposting. *cringe*  




 Thank you :) 




 This has always bugged the shit out of me. Inform me of your logic. So... nobody can have a bf/gf... ever?  




 r/pokemon with posts about Pokemon???? Shocking 




 It's funny how everyone is talking about this except for the fans themselves.  




 Goddammit Helen, pull yourself together 




 Thanks, Obama  




 Which episode is this ?  




 /r/ladyboners ;)  




 Am I the only one that knows this is repost? 
























 That's about the 4th repost I've seen today. And I've only been on here for about 10 minutes.  




 Your life must be so awesome 




 If I had a penny for every time I've heard or seen this phrase on reddit I'd probably have 14 cents. 




 Just as I thought OP was a cool guy 




 What has reddit become...  




 Fucking hell reddit, grow up! You all sound like a bunch if 12 year olds... When did it come to this 




 To be fair, OP never said the turtle was alive...  




 Stupid people piss me off 




 The fact that you claim it's yours when it clearly isn't makes me more mad than it probably should. 




 Would you rather I have a username such as "childrapist4004"  




 You're an awful boyfriend.  









 Why so much One Direction on reddit? 




 Repost 




 Galaxy * 




 Kill yourself  




 You mean.. there are other ways? 




 Repost. OP, you are a fag 




 you mean find this kids parents. 




 Happened to me way too many times...  




 What is this? A screenshot for ants?  









 I just saw this on my news feed and KNEW it would make its way to reddit. It's the little victories... 





























 Reminds me of the Emma Stone .gif 




 no you didn't.  









 Haha suicide jokes! Grow up 




 Where did he ever say he wanted them "off the Internet" I believe you're talking about Beyonce. 




 Alright bring on the downvotes, I'm just so fucking tired of people believing everything they see or hear on the Internet. He wasn't 2 hours late, it was 40 minutes. He didn't "insist on playing video games" when he woke up either. And even if he did, he's fucking human for fucks sake. I'm tired of seeing everything this guy does on here, if I wanted 24/7 Bieber coverage I'd join twitter. Get your fucking facts straight and stop posting about Bieber.

 That isn't funy at all. The girl in this picture in Jamie Foxx's disabled sister. What the fuck OP
 




 That reminds me, I should start my lab report. Thanks 




 you're * 




 Texting? Not likely. Playing a game on his parents phone so he won't be a bother? Most likely. 




 1) not real
2) repost
3) grammar

fuck you, OP  




 This isn't Tumblr. who is upvoting this? 




 If you don't want to watch it... then don't. I'm assuming nobody's going to force you to?  




 I lol'd 




 ^birthday 




 "double tap if you're on Instagram" ... seriously? 




 said the liar 




 all aboard the gold train. next stop: who knows.. 




 All my friends like 9Gag, its just me and another really socially awkward guy who are the only redditors in all my classes.  




 SECOND most dangerous ;)

 "My son" no OP, burn in hell 




 This dog looks like you did more to it than just yelling...  
























 You guys don't actually believe this do you...? 




 r/cringepics 




 Get out of here you bloody brown bastard! (read with Indian accent) 




 #just#me#in#my#room#2deep4u#swag#yolo 




 Will you be my swag 5ever? 




 Just like when the police went to my buddy's house because they didn't know his address. 




 TIL 




 I have kind if a similar story. The whole family went with me to the shelter to pick out a cat and one of them came up to us and just jumped into the baby stroller. I'd like to think she adopted us :)  




 Small town in Switzerland here... everything closes at 5 and nothing is open on Sundays. Consider yourself lucky. 




 Wow awesome. Thanks for this OP 




 They're reminders 




 Great post, thank you http://i.imgur.com/AQXhkNw.jpg 




 Wonderful cat, thank you

 Ahoy! 




 Proud of myself for still not having seen this. 




 I feel like shit knowing I missed this :( 




 I really don't understand this. How the fuck is your sexual preference interfering the way you play?  




 this gave me cancer 




 OP you're a fag 




 Could not agree more. I'm turly sorry for your loss man. Self medicating is not the answer. I think you just need someone you can talk to. Stay strong bro.  




 To clarify, that isn't me. 




 My hands just got sweaty. 




 You know it's gonna be a bad day when you've seen something on Twitter before Reddit.  
























 I posted this a while ago ... :/ 




 Nice repost, faggot. 




 Irony 




 that is awesome dude nice job 




 All you are is mean. 




 Reddit must love Bieber 




 Thought I was in /r/cringepics  




 Ugh not this fake gif again.  




 Most celebs have a blue verified check next to their name. 




 Oh really? I thought that was actually what it was saying, thanks!  









 Leave your wife, she deserves someone better you piece of shit 




 fake, reposted, trolling in the title. seriously ?  




 Demi Lovato? 









 Just waitin' for a mate 




 Karma 




 So glad i'm not the only one ..  




 Better than my "friend" who blames the illuminati...  




 yes , call her Jules aw i love that name. 




 Because everything on the internet is true. 




 I suppose you know this because you were there? 




 This is the exact meme my maths prof. has hung up in class... I suspect a possible redditor. 




 It isn't
