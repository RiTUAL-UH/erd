 So, in this [picture](https://www.imgur.com/4y36GGP), the left side of the plant is dead, while the right is alive. But they're connected at the root. Why? 









 I said to give me suggestions for songs to edit [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ChanceTheRapper/comments/2y0wdw/give_me_suggestions/) and I did them. Here is [Iconic](http://bit.ly/1APkSZl) (only a DL link) and 
[Long Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YxLKumuzQI),
Give me some more! I can do any song!

 nbsp;

EDIT: "Iconic" got taken down from YouTube for copyright, so I will just have the DL link there. 




 I have never agreed with something more. Please Stu, please. 




 So, a while ago, I edited the song "Confident" by Justin Bieber   Chance The Rapper to *only* include Chance's verse [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ChanceTheRapper/comments/2x8eto/justin_bieber_no_more/). Give me suggestions of songs to do this with! Any song that Chance is in, and you want his verse singled out, I can do. 




 I have watched FMA once over, and I don't really wanna get into Brotherhood cause I watched some of it and it looked *veeery* similar to regular FMA. (I know, I sound ignorant) but, just give me reasons to watch it, I'm interested on what you all will say. 




 Tony Bennett, The Ink Spots, VI Seconds, CES Cru, Logic, Frank Sinatra, Avenged Sevenfold, Sleeping With Sirens, Vic Mensa, Mac Miller, and like all of OF.

I'm a bit varied. 




 I edited the song "Confident" and took out most of the Justin Bieber. Only the bridge + the hook is in there.

 As promised:

You are all welcome 




 I really wanna play it, and I see others have access to it as well. So, I was wondering if there was a download link or something along those lines, in which to acquire this wonderful game. 




 You can't. 




 This will be done. 




 I jumped in a pool to save my 2 year old niece. I usually think about shit but that just kinda happened w/o me thinking

 Thank you for educating a young fellow like I. 




 It's in the old one though, by the way. Not the new one that just came out. 




 I do like the warped vocals of Ocean Man, and some of their songs aren't too appealing. I would suggest [Mutilated Lips] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzIHkFJnLbc) if you haven't heard it 




 Yeah, it's the outro song as the credits are playing. 




 Practice wife? 




 I personally haven't seen much *hate*, more of just people wanting Surf and getting frustrated. No one on this Subreddit could hate Chance really.

 [Music] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs926AIL-ck)

One of my favourite songs off "The Mollusk" that was released in 1997. And yes, I did find them off of the Spongebob Movie. 




 I'm interpreting the line "Donnie Trumpet and the Social Experiment are gearing up to drop their debut album, *Surf*, this week featuring Chance the Rapper." as in that they are gearing up this week for the release. Not that they are *releasing* Surf this week, but that they are *preparing* for the drop. 




 I'm decently sure you can't do that 




 I'm glad I could turn you on to them. They're one of my favourite brands as of now 




 I didn't know people resold Greats' shoes lol 









 I just rock a 3/5 Fade. At least that's what I call it. Nothing fancy 




 *upvotes furiously* 




 Can someone please explain this 




 Considering neither #10Day nor Acid Rap were on vinyl, I would assume that the answer is no (rather sadly, might I add). However, this *is technically* Donnie's project that Chance has a big part in. So, we won't know until it happens. 




 *upvotes 1000x times* 
























 No, it isn't. The paint almost always crack and look terrible. Buy some [Angelus Shoe Paint] (http://angelusdirect.com/collections/paint) if you want to paint your shoes.

 I mean I vote for the Toro Bravos, but that's just me. 




 A personal favourite of mine is [GreatsBrand] (https://www.greats.com/). 




 Amen. 




 Dude, just rock what you like. It shouldn't really matter of what others think. Wear what you like. 




 HesKicks made these and called them the Kyrie 1 iD "Mag", after the Air Mag. Then, when All-Stars came around and the All-Star colourways were being released, they released something [very similar] (http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTI5WDk0MA==/z/7j8AAOSweW5U31tN/$_35.JPG) to these.

 Some [Vans Authentic] (http://www.vans.com/shop/canvas-authentic-black) would probably be good. They're only around $50 and come in just about every fucking color in the rainbow.

Or [Converse] (http://www.converse.com/regular/chuck-taylor-classic-colors/MP_51.html), cause you can never go wrong with some Chucks. 




 Not too big a fan of the NB logo on the tongue, but they dope. 




 I personally don't see the appeal in Visvim. 









 In my opinion, no. But, wear what you like man. 




 It's *Donnie's* shit, btw. 




 First heard about this theory [here] (http://www.djbooth.net/index/news/entry/2015-04-06-chance-the-rapper-new-album).

I mean it makes a good bit of sense I guess but I don't think that much logic is behind it. 




 I think Donnie said it in an [interview] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfNVDoX3e1g) on some radio show in LA with Chance

Edit: Power 106 is in New York, not LA. I apologize. 




 This has to do with the switch from the Julian calender to the Gregorian calender. January and Fabuary I think weren't in the Julian and then inserted into the Gregorian, thus pushing October two months ahead.

Edit: I am wrong.

 Just look up "Chance The Rapper [song] Remix" and look through the results. You're bound to find something
 




 Ah, I see. Well that's cool. I personally think it would have been better w/ no drop and just like a really nice remix and warp of the vocals and all that jazz. 




 Did you find this off the A Capella remix someone posted? 




 OG just means it has "Nike Air" on the toungue.

I have no idea if they're legit or not, but that's what that means. 




 You obtained these for fucking $13.

 Alrightie yeah, thismakes a bit of sense. Thanks for the info 




 I've seen Gel Lyte IIIs and Gel Lyte Vs, but are IVs a thing? If so, could you link a picture? 




 Is it really? I downloaded it and the title is "Long Time 2" 




 No, I mean the two different songs off #10Day. 




 I personally like the latter (Long Time II) a bit more. 




 I personally don't like the KD 7 Elites. They just look really odd to me. But, good for you man! Wear what you like 




 I'm with [Tuesday] (http://www.reddit.com/user/Tuesday), I think the Sock Darts are ugly, don't really understand the hype.

Then again, everyone has their own style, so like what you like. 




 I'm not too big a fan of the Ventilators. But, I can definitely see the appeal in them.

 Honestly I would fund a kickstarter to get this into a like full-length Novel. I crave more. However, I have a question. Why can't Phil go back to the mortal world? Was it the demon thing he did?

 /u/Stokeez already linked it. So, thank you feller 




 Don't worry, I gotchu both

I'll download   upload to MediaFire 




 Yeah I saw that too, interesting. I wonder if that's going on Chance's Solo project. 









 Speaking of, is there any way you could link them to me? The novels, I mean. Since I don't know your real name I can't really Google it lol. Sorry if it's an inconvenience. 




 RemindMe! May 27 at 8 PM 




 This is amazing. It's short, yes, but amazing. You and /u/RPWrites are my favourite Reddit-Writers. 

I definitely will be looking into those novels of yours. 




 Anyone know how long this is going on? 




 That says AZ-T09*3*, not 5 




 Thank you so much for having Greats on here! I feel as though that as a brand, they don't get enough recognition in the sneaker/streetwear world. 




 So I may or may not be making a compilation of this in a file on my computer named "The Devil's Daughter" 




 You sing it too, but your Grandma ain't my Grandma 




 I just recently watched this and is currently my favourite Short Film. 




 Velco Roshes don't exist. Not that I am aware of, at least.

If you're feelin creative, buy a pair and *make* them velcro. 




 Could someone link that Filling Pieces? 




 How does one rock Combat Boots like those? 
























 /r/SexyAbortions 




 I don't know man. Do you like them? That's really all that matters. 




 Wear what you think looks good dude.

Something I suggest is to buy a shoe, and let it sit in the open. Look at it for a while. Try it on, walk around the house with it, etc.

If you start to like it, then keep 'em. Money well spent. If *not*, then return them. It's that simple. 




 I've been looking in to these recently. How do they fit? 




 What pairs do you have? 




 oooohhh, the way you worded it made it seem like "My Yeezys, or my Bred AF1s."

Like you were talking about Yeezys. 




 Around once a week 




 Is it just me or is there a lot more movement? 




 Need. 




 What colourway? 




 What do these look like? 




 Like the silhouette in general or a specific colourway? 




 I need to get a pair of these still 




 That honestly isn't a bad colourway.  









 Yep, it does happen to be on there

[John Oliver carrying out promises he made] (http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/390d0l/john_oliver_carrying_out_promises_he_made/) 




 Where'd the creases go? 




 I've been a bit iffy on these. How do they fit/feel? 









 I feel like you could turn this into a really dope picture 




 I mean you could go both ways. The gray would match a monochrome outfit. Gray/white shirt, black denim. But so could the blue as a "pop" piece.

That being said, I suggest the grey pair as you can match it with more, but buy/wear what you like. 




 For example, one of mine is the LeBron 9 "Hornets". Most people look at me weird when I say that, but it's because it was the shoe that kind of introduced me into all of this *and* the first shoe I bought with my own, hard-earned money.

What are some of your guys'? 




 You could buy a Size 9 in the shoe and maybe add an insole or two in the left shoe to make it fit a bit smaller? Idk, might work, might not. 




 You can try dipping them in melted wax and then a clear sealant. I mean I have no *real* idea if it will work, it's just a suggestion. 
























 I misread this as "*James* in the waiting room" and got really confused lol. Clean pair though! 




 I personally wouldn't consider 183 days *near*, but I guess from a statistical standpoint it would make sense. 




 Ya know, I'm not entirely sure myself

 I LOVE YOU 




 Nope, not that either. Thanks though man 




 I am 100% sure it was Wii and equally sure it was *not* Castle Crashers, as I said the game was First Person. Thanks though! 




 Nada. Thanks though! 




 No, not this either. Thanks! 




 it was a First Person game. Thanks though! 




 December 21^st , 20*15*? 




 No, not that. It was like an actual *game*, with a story and a goal I think. I just know it wasn't Medieval Games. Thanks though 




 I remember playing this game around 5 or 6 years ago or so. It was a medieval-ish cartoon looking game. **First person**, you went around slashing people and stuff like that. 

The colors red and brown stand out to me. [As well as a rope bridge with like wooden logs.] (http://quad-atv.specs-sa.com/Images/berakah/three_meter_bridge_approach.jpg)'

Sorry for the vague description, it was all I could remember. Thanks for any help you can give me!

Edit: Games it is not: Overlord: Dark Legend, Medieval Games, Red Steel 2, or Swordplay Showdown on Wii Sports Resort. 




 Probably just the perspective. I didn't even notice that they looked like that until I read this comment. 




 Yes! Greats is my favourite brand as of now. What is your opinion on the new "Pronto" runner they are coming out with? 




 Hey man, we all start somewhere. Not a bad collection tbh, like the KD VIs the most personally. 




 [Alternate] (http://www.kicksonfire.com/2015/06/10/air-jordan-alternate-collection-air-jordan-2-air-jordan-4-air-jordan-5-low/) | [Poster] (http://www.kicksonfire.com/2015/06/10/air-jordan-poster-collection-air-jordan-2-air-jordan-12/) | [Dunk From Above] (http://www.kicksonfire.com/2015/06/10/air-jordan-dunk-from-above-collection-air-jordan-1-air-jordan-4-air-jordan-5-low/?utm_source=dlvr.it utm_medium=twitter utm_campaign=kicksonfire)

In my opinion, the "Alternate" Pack is the best. But in terms of *individual shoes*, I think that the 5 lows from the "Dunk From Above" pack is the best colourway. The contrast in the White/Navy combination with the hints of gold really sell it for me.

What are your opinions? 




 The "downvote" key is for something that doesn't contribute to the conversation at hand. 

Like if I were to just post " A nipple farted in my anus" then it should be downvoted because it doesn't contribute to the conversation. 




 What Dunk colourway, if there is a specific one? 




 How'd you come across this? 




 I like the minimalim to be honest. Might usr it

 Should I size up? Or would my normal size suffice. 




 You just gotta go on the right days. I've seen Blazer Mids, Dunks, some Gel-Lyte 5s once, and a few pairs of Janoskis. 




 Your name is amazing. 




 They have like 9 pairs at my local Ross lol. I was going to cop but they didn't have my god damned size. 




 Have the Air Mags been confirmed to have power lacing? Last I heard it was still a rumor. 




 Nice find man. Ross is one of those stores where if you go on the right days you'll find some nice shit. 




 How do they fit? I've been looking into these recently and was wondering 




 Ah, a classic 




 Did that because I kind of took it as a title that *is* a question rather than a question itself. I don't usually type like that. 









 /r/evenwithcontext 




 This fit is the best one I've seen here. I think I'm a bit biased though because I'm into photography and this is also the best taken photo I've seen so far lol.

Good shit man 




 Yeah lol. I've seen a few pairs of Janoski's at mine, but never in my god damned size 




 Almost did this the other day lol. I noticed the buttons were on the left and was just like "something fishy's goin on right now" 




 Nice cop man! I found that Nike SB hat which I didn't end up buying, and [This one] (http://i.imgur.com/IsCOwEk.jpg) which I *did* end up buying. You just have to go on the right days and you can find some good shit
