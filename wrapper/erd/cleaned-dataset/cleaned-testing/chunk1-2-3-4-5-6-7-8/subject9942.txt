 I don't know any satanic music... 




 a system based on rules and works to get you 'whatever the goal is': enlightenment, nirvana or salvation in the case of Christianity 




 they're not exactly rules, it's a little more complicated than that

and it's a place holder title, atm anyways 




 one of the criteria for porn is:

The work as a whole must lack "serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific values".

so porn is meaningless other than for sexual purposes 




 it is compelling, because suicide is a popular 'solution' as well as other various coping methods and your testimony can be used to demonstrate the joy, love and hope in the cross.

if it's not compelling, then it is not convincing enough that there is a God 




 you say you were raised Christian, you need to be more specific

You are taking a theological approach to this, which I don't recommend.

What I do is understand that you should start over anew and go back to basics: what and why Jesus did what he did and go from there. 




 I honestly couldn't think of title and I just needed this post for a different post, that's all

it definitely needs a better title, sorry 




 not referring to those genres

I mean what I say 




 there are only 2 commandments as rules (there are other commandments):

**Matthew 22:37-40; Mark 12:30-31; Luke 10:27** 
1) Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind
2) Love your neighbor as yourself
______________________________________________

**1 Corinthians 6:12, 10:23** "I have the right to do anything," you say--but not everything is beneficial. "I have the right to do anything"--but not everything is constructive.

**1 Corinthians 6:19**
Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own;

**1 Corinthians 10:31; Colossians 3:17** whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.

**1 Timothy 4:4** For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving

**Philippians 4:8** whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable--if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think about such things.
_____________________________________________
**Matthew 5:17**
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.

Background: when Jesus came to die on the cross, it is to take up our sin, only because he kept the law at full (thus no sin in him), and bury into the grave and we no longer live in sin but we are free from sin because Jesus resurrected from the dead.

So in everything that we do it is based on discernment and conviction not based on rules.
_____________________________________________
note: was with anything, there will be exceptions
examples:

1)tattoos:
-if you are getting one to spite or rebel against someone that is not a good reason to get one you might hurt yourself (no longer love yourself)
-you can honor God by getting a tattoo and with right intentions

2) (secular)music:
-songs with positive messages (who says by Selena Gomez, Skyscraper by Demi Lovato), love songs can help you lover yourself or others, your neighbors
-songs that have no meaning but can be fun (anaconda by Nicki Minaj) are just meant to be fun with right intentions
-satanic music cannot be redeemed by God, avoid these

3) homosexuality
-it's the sexual act, not the marriage
-it provides no (evolutionary) advantage, it is meaningless, lust and flesh therefore it is not honorable for God
-STDs, and general sexual consquences

4) Porn
-lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific values, therefore cannot be redeemed for the honor of God

5) Drugs
-obvious

etc.

In conclusion, it is not a matter whether it is a sin or not but what your intentions are and discernment (exceptions to those who have clouded judgments and outliers). Sin is transgression of the law (Exodus, Leviticus and Deuteronomy) and you are free from those but it is a matter whether it is beneficial to you, others or God or not. No, you cannot just name something n honor of God and hope to redeem it.

**1 Samuel 16:7b**
People look at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart." 
























 I used to

but the problem is no lane presence and/or how will you get past all the cc 




 it now comes to the point whether you can reliably apply the cc, correctly

for example, tf's stun card takes time 




 it's possible but then it comes to the question to whether you can stun kat reliably 




 the support role cannot just be filled by anyone

all adcs are viable, but not every adc can fit into just any team comp

some people try to be unconventional with adc lulu, adc ahri, adc kennen, etc 




 oops 




 not all of them are viable, so the number is actually lower

compared to adc which have 18
it makes sense at least 15 should be enough 




 it's a root, not hard CC...

even then, it does not stop kat ult... 




 simply put: there are not enough champions to fill in the role and it gets tedious trying to rotate among them (I counted 14 using my definition) when there isn't a lot to begin with. you can only play leona so much before you go crazy

the way I define support is: can you stop kat ult? (reliably, such as in the case of morgana, is a different story though)
this is what honestly is keeping the support role from being able to fit in other champions. if we just nerfed (preferably delete) katarina then this will be better.

1) traditional supports:
-alistar
-blitzcrank
-braum
-janna
-leona
-lulu
-nami
-sona
-soraka
-thresh
-taric
total: 11

2) mages that went support
-annie
-fiddlesticks
-morgana
-vel'koz
-zyra
total: 5

3) situational supports or those that fail to meet the criteria (usually no hard cc)
-lux
-kayle
-karma
-zilean
-all other mages 




 Saying her spear does less damage is not exactly fixing. The spear can still do a lot: if it used to be 90% of health it's 70% of health, so that reduction is not meaningful, plus she can just go in and execute. She's strong range and melee.

These are not counterplay:
Dodge the spear,
Cc her,
She has to put herself at 'risk'(what about a champion like talon?) 
























 or she can just jump to you?? 




 people insist this as a form of counter play lol

you can say this about every melee champion 




 they removed his silence (do you not read?)

also, she could be last pick (assuming not banned) 




 not all champions in the other 4 roles must have some form of cc to be a decent team comp

for example, people would just go that once thresh is picked, he's all the cc they would need

and you're the one that's incompetent 




 I'm not entirely sure on this, some sources say that the pillar doesn't

how can cait stop a kat ult?? 




 This is about her ult, only

here is a list of champions that CAN'T stop kat's ult:

-Akali
-Caitlyn
-Corki
-Mundo
-Eve
-Ez
-Fiora
-Gankplank
-Graves
-Jinx
-Karma
-Karthus
-Kat
-Kayle
-Khazix
-Kog
-Leblanc (since she lost silence)
-Lucian
-Lux
-Yi
-Miss Fortune
-Mord
-Nasus
-Nidalee
-Nunu
-Olaf
-Rengar 
-Rumble
-Ryze
-Sivir
-Swain
-Talon (since he lost silence)
-Teemo
-Trundle (?)
-Tryndamere
-Twitch
-Varus
-Vlad
-Yorick
-Zed
-Zilean
total: 41/123

champions with UNRELIABLE cc:
-Ahri
-Amumu (must use bandage toss to stop her; his ult does not stop kat)
-Anivia (ice ball is slow, not sure about wall)
-Ashe
-Brand
-Cass
-Elise
-Fizz
-Gnar (must be mega gnar to stop her)
-Heimerdinger
-Irelia
-Kennen
-Morg
-Nocturne
-Shaco
-Shyvana
-Syndra?
-Twisted Fate
-Viktor
-Xerath
-Xin?
-Yasuo
-Ziggs
-Zyra
total:24/123

a grand total of 65/123 champions that cannot be picked

conclusion: just by picking kat (some might argue akali, yi and fiora but roots do stop these champions, unlike kat), you invalidate half the champion pool. Not many of the adcs (not everyone is gonna pick ashe, vayne, tristana or quinn) can stop kat's ult and because adc is necessary, we only get to choose 4 out of 58 champions and it's not even 58 as some are not viable (for example: zac, urgot and galio)
and yes she has high win rate and high banning status (especially in korea, don't know about NA):
http://www.op.gg/statistics/champion/katarina/

my problem with kat, not that I lost to one, is that she is the reason you cannot just pick any champion into any role and well forces picks (mainly support since the support is required to have CC just so you can stop katarina) where as sometimes I want to support with zilean and karma, for example but cannot.
 




 how is it wrong...

-ashe
-caitlyn
-corki
-ezreal
-draven
-graves
-jinx
-lucian
-kalista
-kog'maw
-miss fortune
-quinn(if you are going to indicate this one is not then fine it's still a total of 15)
-sivir
-tristana
-twitch
-urgot
-varus
-vayne 




 taric (maybe he is viable?), alistar (better in solo lane or jungle) and lulu(better in solo lane), 
blitzcrank and soraka are binary or situational picks, for example you wouldn't ALWAYS pick blitz, 
thresh (this one is a mix: some will say he's not viable, others will argue he's still relevant; I've just never seen a good one since the last sets of nerfs)

fiddlesticks got nerfed out of viability 




 veigar is wasted as a support

and did you not read, karma and zilean are not good picks (despite utility) because they lack cc

so that's 15 and then, not every support is viable so it's less than 15 
























 transtrenders can be of any kind, not specifically of non-binaries (nor that I'm saying nonbinaries are necessarily transtrenders)

there is no policing or invalidation if the case study is what it is 




 that was part/conclusion of the study. I'm not hiding facts here, she said that being a man while still a woman was hurting her.

and I'm sorry that happened to you. There's no such things as not being dysphoric enough. Just either you are or you are not. 




 are they women that are fine with being men and thus are defined as men?

because Norah still feels/felt like a woman while being disguised as a man. That's why it was hard for her. 




 okay fair enough, I do believe in androgynous and agender (although they do fit into the definition of binary) but all other non-binaries claim a 'third gender' which is what I was referring more to 














 you are just assuming homosexuality is moral, which is what this argument is trying to prove/disprove. you have circular reasoning. 




 regardless of my stance on homosexuality and I am not trying to prove/go against it, I just want to get rid of this fallacious argument.

what I mean is that people say homosexuality is found in many species, okay so what?
on the other hand people go against nature to justify gender issues??

cannibalism or eating their young ones, rape, destroying another one's genitals, fight to death, leaving disabled ones to die out, and other behavior is found in other species, does that make it okay?
(I know things like cannibalism is still practiced in certain cultures but the idea is we still view it as 'wrong') 




 sona can get too boring to play really fast (not to mention the multiple nerfs, like 30) for such a huge investment; not amount of fancy particles is going to make it more enjoyable (unless they just overhaul her kit I'm talking about in-game effects, for example remove cc with her heal and what not).

also, in my opinion: might as well not give the discount since the discount is fairly meaningless.

Ezreal doesn't get boring fast (although may the skin might since all skills are blue but w/e). and Udyr certainly has dynamics. 
























 gender is neurological/psychological, so it exists (it is not a social construct)
even observable behavior patterns for each gender are real

but yea, if there is no 'defined sets of genders, there is no 'transitioning,' you can be born and well what gender are you?? we can't define it if we didn't have male or female.

people think gender roles are checklists, when i see it as more of a guideline. and it just happens, no, someone did not sit down and said, girls will like to shop and boys will prefer sports. Rather, it just happens that these trends are true. 




 in all other languages, the masculine version just gets used in a group of male and female

no one seems to have a problem with that

why should English? 




 I met a girl, in a club space. She explicitly told me she was cis (I hate that term by the way) and then a week later turned genderfluid. We don't talk anymore.

transtrenders claim that dysphoria is not necessary; they might change pronouns on a daily basis. Moreover, you can tell they're just doing it for oppression points or whatever. 




 Serious question

If you are talking to a transgender (person), you would refer to them using you (as you should unless you have quirks that make you use third person referencing in a conversation).

I might refer to a transgender(person): friend (gender neutral), person (gender neutral), but almost never use he/she/they? 

and even if I do refer to them in third person pronouns, they wouldn't be in audible range (to be offended)? (note I'm not saying I want to misgender nor do I not respect their pronouns, I'm speaking theoretically)

for example, I met this person the other day, he was nice and she bought me ice cream. Afterwards, they went home safely. This person doesn't know I'm talking about him/her/them.

so yea, I've almost never had to use their pronouns. Now if you are going to tell me, I just used it here, I would argue I could've used any and they wouldn't know about it. 




 she asked for advice on reddit 2 months before it happened 




 that guy is just putting words in my mouth, things I never said and claims I have misconceptions when he's the one inventing them and accusing me of them

yea, transgenders don't usually have dysmorphia 




 body dysmorphia and gender dysphoria are not the same, they might be connected at times 




 I never indicated all transgenders undergo SRS 




 okay that makes a lot of sense, thanks! 
























 because I messed up okay 




 hmm, okay that's very helpful, thank you for your insight. In fact it's better than most other people who give liek a criticism with no detail.

if they're bi but prefer dating one kind wouldn't that make them either gay or straight? (tbh, I was going to let it pass the bi's since it helps them but the problem is if I grant it to them why not gay or straight and I want to avoid this whole complication)

the main reason I don't think we should just hand out the identity, freely because honestly, people treat asexuality as a joke, not because they might not understand it but it's because of the dreaded SJWs and other fake people in this way:
I have seen cases where people claim to be asexual to deny sex (as opposed to just saying no - now I know you will say rape will happen, but it's just gonna get more complicated so it's a completely different discussion). Also people can claim to be anything under the asexual spectrum and we can't say if they're lying or not. Now I'm all for like you can be this or that but they just do horrible things (hypocrisy namely) such that it actually makes groups like asexuals and transgender people look like a joke. do you get what I mean? (think of Westboro Baptist Church onto Christianity, for example)

and yea, I guess asexuals do face discrimination (different word), though and I don't know right now, it's still 'relatively new' (even though 14 years is a lot). There are still a lot of things we don't know yet and this once again is why asexuality (awareness) is very important and I still hope to learn more about asexuality. 




 I just wanted to vent on this topic

I believe that asexuality is important in many ways.
to begin with, it's a nice identity for those themselves that need it. unfortunately, we can't prove who is asexual and some people trend and claim it and might make asexuality look bad (it happens to any group). In fact, I am annoyed that people take the romantic orientations (I believe it was designed for asexuals so that it simplifies things because some asexuals still want to date). Now, as for me and along a few others, we agree that the identity isn't useful for other person to know (unless you are dating) because it doesn't matter whether you are straight, gay, bi or ace because we care more about things like personality (sure your sexuality might have influence but whatever). It is important to note that asexuality is very diverse and each one has different behaviors and stuff: for example, some you will meet will be sex-repulsed, others might not, etc.


so overall forget identity (just keep it to yourself, it really doesn't matter) what asexuality is more important for is the concept of it. It allows room for topics such as kinks (namely BDSM, I believe it's an alternative to sex), polygamy/polyamory, communication, intimacies/touch, sexology (it might sound ironic), aromanticism (these I feel are least understood right now), (maybe) deal with rape, topics and issues like Japan's sexual apathy, and lastly, a lot of transgender people come into the community which is nice and cool, and much more.


lastly, yes, asexuals are not oppressed (not that I am aware of) but the awareness again is not for oppression points but rather for spaces and benefits (and thus asexual awareness is important) for what I listed above. 




 I never said it was acceptable though, you are just assuming (you people please need to stop doing that), but it will still happen. For example rape, rapists will always exist and rape (doesn't mean we shouldn't raise awareness either, but no amount of awareness is going to stop rape, people learning self defence will) or people will do drugs even with awareness, education and being illegal (intervention and therapy sessions will fix these problems). 




 What Christianity is not:

-gay bashing
-anti evolution/science or creation vs evolution
-anti woman
-definitely not anti tattoos
-not all those things being misconstrued in media

What Christianity is about:
-God, Jesus, Holy Spirit (Trinity)
-grace and redemption
-hope and love

so can we not waste time on creation vs evolution debates? either of them, it( i.e. just assume that creation) happened already, move on and focus on the more important parts like grace. Also, it is okay to ask God questions (or question God).

One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?
Jesus replied: Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself. All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments. - Matthew 22:35-40 




 oh okay I guess I am attuned to it, so that's why I am having a hard time understanding.
thanks for being the most sensible here and well people talk behind other people's backs as it is. that's just how the world is. take care! 




 that guy was talking about SRS when I didn't say anything about it 




 I use you guys as gender neutral and many others do so too, so it's a common practice so it's a subjective argument

lastly, your gender is not the only part of your identity, it's A part (heck I'd rather see past your gender more of your personality, and yes gender can influence your personality) 




 children should be taught to (almost) always ask for sources or proof
(if it's a personal matter, ask the specific person for personal information based matter)

Also teach children to be kind (do unto other as you would have them do unto you sort of morals).
As for me, I just don't care (not in the sense I don't want to hear it, just more along the lines of do what you want-provided it's logical) whether another girl or guy does this or that (or not that I wouldn't support them if it seemed appropriate). I would recommend also that people focus on more important matters than trivial things, like whether this person did this or that (please be logical, if the rumor is someone fed someone else then it doesn't apply here) is not going to fix world hunger. (if you're going to argue what am I doing, myself. well I am studying hydrology because I believe having accessible drinking water is important)

ugh, if you are going to criticize me for celebrity matters, it's for entertainment (entertainment is necessary too, and as i mentioned, I like hearing people's stories, maybe they even inspire me but like okay it's not like there isn't anyone who has a new boyfriend every week other than Taylor Swift)

if I missed anything, be logical

honestly, I feel it comes down to being logical or having common sense. I know not everyone will 'be nice,' but if you're not going to do it, nobody else will. 
























 so for most cases, people are sure they are failing and therefore ask whether to withdraw or take the F (the catch all answer is to most likely withdraw)

I can't find a case for where you are borderline passing: like hit or miss pass.

Should you take the course to its entirety (with the risk of potentially failing)? or just withdraw anyways?

I guess this is one of those gray areas. Give me what you think, if there is no generalized catch-all answer. Consider/factor in financial aid. 




 I honestly believe my csing is really bad;
positioning but that's team fighting phase, although I do have to deal with skillshots and stuff as well during laning; the only thing that bothers me in mid lane is getting ganked since I do try to be aggressive (force the opponent mid lane out and you also kinda need to do that vs 'weak early game').

also, what sort of champion is considered high difficult in mid? 




 I'm largely orianna, ziggs main: so basically mages

not a huge fan of assassins, the ones that comes close though are Diana and Akali

idk what ahri is, she's like a mix of in between 




 but queue times for mid tend to be long, thanks for the advice though haha 




 hmm, very good question. I really cannot handle said responsibility 




 the reason I am asking this is because it is the most popular lane (we're talking about normals here) and well, if you get it to practice and happen to not do well, you screw up everyone else's experience.

the only good thing is if I don't want it, usually someone else will take it (ranked) 




 I agree, otherwise most people would fit into genderfluid and thus invalidate the whole identity anyways

no person ever fully feels male or fully female, exclusively... 




 it simply doesn't

the only thing it has any effect is my personality which is what I want people to care about (except my partner)

my personality: very compassionate and friendly (sometimes it scares people), not afraid to say I love them but you know: people think I say I'm in love with them and just all around (try to be) funny person. 




 you are just simply sex repulsed. Done. 
























 pan is just for people who don't want to identify as bi + have a special snowflake status, so yes pan is really bi (because let's face it bi get the shortest end of the stick here), therefore pansexuality is not real and redundant (as well as biphobic tbh).

the argument for all these other genders are meaningless. 




 some of SJWs are in upper middle class or upper class, I think (at least that's what I heard). At least, they are well off. 




 because any other pronoun would be unladylike 




 I agree with everything you said

they need to stop making up genders as well as falsely claiming some of these genders either
especially with 'nonbinary' 




 yes, escape velocity 




 they fight against men

http://tryingtomakesenseofpeople.tumblr.com/post/113807401152/okay-what-you-dont-understand-is-that-feminism 




   karma (not a stun), Leblanc (not a stun), lux(not a stun), varus(not a stun), ahri (try charming her), amumu (ult does not stop it; try landing bandage toss or engage without bandage toss), anivia (q moves too slow), ashe (block the arrow), brand (need combo), cass (needs to be facing cass), Elise (see ahri), heim (aoe stun is very small), irelia (needs to be lower hp), kennen (takes too long to stun), morg (takes too long to stun), nocturne (takes too long), shaco (needs box set up), shyvana (only cc is ult), syndra (needs to land eq), tf (takes too long), Viktor (gravity field takes too long), xerath (see ahri), xin (takes too long), yasuo (needs build up), ziggs (need to sacrifice escape)

(she kills people in under 2 sec and they had high amounts of cc)

TL;DR **YOUR** logic is flawed 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HvVBRzK0eY

they had plenty of cc
yet katarina can kill a whole team in under 2s 




 thank you, very helpful
