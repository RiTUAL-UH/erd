 I know that wind chill is used when it is cold and heat index when it is hot, but what determines when weather forecasters switch from one to the other?  Is it temperature, humidity, etc.? 









 It is an African Red Knob Sea Star

1) You are an accompished chef, restaurateur, author, television personality and philanthropist, but what is your proudest accomplishment we do not know about?

2) You are fluent in profanity, I am sure you do not speak around your children like that, but are they aware of that side of you?

3) What chefs have inspired you?

4) What is the one thing you personally must have in your refrigerator/panty?

5) Can anybody make a scallop dish to your satisfaction? 














 Yesterday evening I left flowers on my girlfriend's from door, so that when she came home from bartending and she see them, which would hopefully put a smile on her face since we couldn't have our Valentine's day together.  After not hearing anything from her this morinng, I finally asked her if she saw them.  She responsed with, "You mean those were mine? They are on my roommate's dresser.  She thought she had a secret admirer."  Now we don't have the heart to tell her otherwise, but don't know what to do.  Input...   
























 My neighbor asked me to help her move a couch.  When I went into the room she had all of her previous pets stuffed and mounted.  She still said hello to all of them.

 What is the kilo to couric conversion factor? 




 Do you know the formula to calculate those? 
























 One of these guys, the 35 year old, was a good friend of mine.  I'm not going to reveal his name, but my thoughts are with his family. 














 The BlackTron collection was the best. 




 I would say the female lead, but yes I agree. 




 So is Michael Bay using Megan Fox as the lead female in all his movies based on favorite toys from my childhood? 




 I think I can already see the drum circle forming.  If they are not careful if could become a full-fledged music festival.  Call Cartman. 




 And for those of you who haven't been there...no alcohol 
























 Streets are always wet.  Parking garages and warehouses have huge puddles in them. 




 My girlfriend must be Lord Vader 




 At least she ate some of her food.  His is just getting cold. 




 Thank you for your services

 Close, but I would call that a Red Knob Sea Star  




 Maybe it was just a vicious, ass koala bear.  Did anybody investigate that? 





























 My fianc, but the remote to the tv is in the other room 









 I'm moving to Providence in the coming month with my fianc.  I'm 31 and with no children.  I've been told I would like downtown or east side Providence (not East Providence).  I know nothing about the area.  Any suggestions on neighborhoods, apartments or surrounding areas to live or avoid would be great.  -thanks  














 Is there not an appropriate time?

 Here is a list of some restaurants and bars:
Greenville - Winslows Tavern, Christie's Euro Pub, Atavola, Carolina Ale House, AJs, CPWs, Wasabi 88, Starlight Lounge (trendy), and Villedge

Kinston (about 25 minutes away) - Mother Earth Brewery, Ginger, Red Room, Boiler Room and Chef and the Farmer (Top 100 rest. in America) 
                  
                   




 Greenville is not as bad as people are saying.  Granted I just moved from there for a job, but my 5 year tenure there was not bad.  I was not a student there, but in my late 20s.  Apartment-wise look in the Wimbledon and Madison (used to called Hyde Park, until they renovated them).  I lived in Wimbledon for 3 years and enjoyed it.  As far as things to do go, most people are right there is not a whole lot, especially if you don't want to party with 20 year olds.  There are some descent restaurants in the area. Like people said you can kayak, fish, go to the beach, hike and scuba with all in day trip range.  Raleigh is also only an hour or so away, so you got that.  Like everybody has been saying avoid west of Evans and north of 5th at all costs.  I recommend staying in the vicinity of Arlington/Red Banks Rd.  Would I want to be there for long, absolutely not, but for a short period, i.e. grad school, you can deal with it.
