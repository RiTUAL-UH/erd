 In AskScience and Science we have a lot of flaired users, and we'd like to be able to add them to a private subreddit, right now it's done entirely by hand, which is a real chore if several people have added flair.  

Is there an existing script or bot that would automate the process, like the script that syncs flair between two subreddits?  I'm not a programmer, but it seems like something that should be straight forward to do with PRAW.

 Environmental biology professor at [Fort Lewis College Durango, CO, USA]( http://www.fortlewis.edu), [studying the biological impacts of climate change](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QcIjyzwAAAAJ hl=en).  She studied the biological consequences of earlier snowmelt, climate warming, and most recently elevated CO2.  Her research on how elevated CO2, not just climate warming, leads to a longer growing season was [published in the journal Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature13207.html), and reported in the [news](http://www.nature.com/news/co2-makes-growing-seasons-longer-1.15081), including in a [New York Times column on changing seasons and its consequences](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/science/springing-forward-and-its-consequences.html).  Studies like hers highlight the need to better understand the impacts of environmental changes that happen at the same time.  Her study shows an apparent benefit of greater CO2 concentrations on growing season length that we did not expect based on [an earlier conceptual model on changing seasons] (https://www.sciencemag.org/content/324/5929/886.summary).  Earths biological systems are changing due to human choices, and we need to better understand the impacts, both positive and negative, to reduce the associated risks.

 **Science AMA Series: We helped create the Third National Climate Assessment Report. Ask us anything!**

This past Tuesday, May 6, the White House released the Third U.S. National Climate Assessment - the most comprehensive national effort to assess the science and effects of climate change in the U.S. The report is designed to help officials, businesses, and members of the public in all regions and sectors of the country make the best decisions when dealing with climate change and managing related risk. The NCA also illustrates how these regions and sectors are connected. Unlike previous assessments, this NCA has been released as an interactive website, nca2014.globalchange.gov, to make it more accessible and useful to both citizens and scientists.

We are researchers at the University of Arizona who played a significant role in both the overall report leadership and especially the Southwest and Forestry chapters. We will be answering questions starting at 2PM EST. 

Who is here:
Kathy Jacobs - Recently returned to the University of Arizona to lead the UAs Center for Climate Adaptation Science and Solutions after serving as the Director of the National Climate Assessment for the White House.

Gregg Garfin - Lead author of the Southwest chapter of the NCA and Professor in the UAs School of Natural Resources and the Environment


Dave Breshears - Lead author on the Forests chapter of the NCA, drawing on his expertise on drought-related tree die-off, and Professor in the UAs School of Natural Resources and the Environment


Dan Ferguson - Director of the Climate Assessment for the Southwest 


Thomas McDonald - Project and Events Coordinator at the University of Arizonas Institute of the Environment, helping us navigate Reddit and input our answers.


tl;dr - The White House released the third National Climate Assessment(NCA) on Tuesday. It is comprehensive, designed to help everyone make decisions to deal with climate change, and released as an interactive website, a first for the Feds. The just-returned-from-the-White-House former director of the NCA, Kathy Jacobs, and a number of contributors, all from the University of Arizona, will be here starting at 2PM EST, 5/9/14 to answer your questions.

 Prof. Richard Betts, Climate scientist and Lead author of the most recent IPCC report is doing an AMA in /r/science today.  Please stop by with any questions about the IPCC or climate science!

Here is a link to the AMA:

This gave me a good fright until I figured it out, for some reason, and this is something that not many would notice, in subs with many user flairs, if you have RES enabled the "Next" button to see the next page of user flair is gone.  This gives the impression that the user flair has been deleted, but it's still there.  

If you disable RES and reload the "Next" button appears and you can go through the list.

 ##**Science Verified User Program**

/r/science has a a system of verifying accounts for commenting, enabling trained scientists, doctors and engineers to make credible comments in /r/science . The intent of this program is to enable the general public to distinguish between an educated opinion and a random comment without a background related to the topic. 


#**What flair is available?**

All of the standard science disciplines would be represented, matching those in the sidebar.
However, to better inform the public, the level of education is displayed in the flair too. For example, a Professor of biology is tagged as such (Professor- Biology), while a graduate student of biology is tagged as "Grad Student-Biology." Nurses would be tagged differently than doctors, etc...

The general format is:

Level of education|Field|Speciality or Subfield (optional)

When applying for a flair, please inform us on what you want it to say.

#**How does one obtain flair?**


First, have a college degree or higher in a field that has flair available.
Then send proof to the mods of /r/science .

This can be provided several ways:

1) Message the mods with information that establishes your claim, this can be a photo of your diploma or course registration, a business card, a verifiable email address, or some other identification. All submissions will be kept in confidence and not released to the public under any circumstances. You can submit an imgur link and then delete it after verification. 

Remember, that within the proof, you must tie your account name to the information in the picture.


2) if you aren't comfortable messaging the mods with identifying information, you can directly message any individual mod and supply the information to them. Again, your information will be held in confidence.


3) Send an email with your information to sciencereddit@gmail.com after messaging the mods to inform them of this option. Your email will then be deleted after verification, leaving no record. 

This is convenient if you want to take a photo of your identification and email from a smart phone, for example.

Edit:  Hi.  We're getting flooded with requests, we're adding people as fast as we can, if we miss you somehow, we apologize, if you don't see your flair or get a response in the next two days, message us again.

Thanks for making /r/science a better place!

 Ebola has been in the news a lot lately, but the recent news of a case of it in Dallas has alarmed many people.  

The short version is:  Everything will be fine, healthcare systems in the USA are more than capable of dealing with Ebola, there is no threat to the public.

That being said, after discussions with the verified users of /r/science, we would like to open up to questions about Ebola and infectious diseases.

**Please consider donations to [Doctors Without Borders](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/our-work/medical-issues/ebola?utm_source=google utm_medium=ppc utm_term=brand_sitelink) to help fight Ebola, it is a serious humanitarian crisis that is drastically underfunded.** (Yes, I donated.)

Here is the ebola fact sheet from the World Health Organization: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/

 We're looking for a practical way to judge Panelist activity in /r/AskScience, and a good way would be to generate a log like the moderation log but tracking flaired users.  We don't care so much what they've posted, but rather how much Panelists post, so a simple tabulation of the poster and the number of comments would be fine.

Seems like it would be straight forward, but I've learned that simple things sometimes aren't so simple, so it makes sense to ask more experienced people first!

 Even worse, some big name highly competitive chemists (I think it was Corey) would completely leave out critical steps in their procedures so that their competition *couldn't* reproduce it.

Shameful it is.  




 Chiropractary has never had any proof it belongs in medicine, as a field chiropractors reject evidence-based methodology, huge difference. 




 In fairness, so does literally every other field of science, chemistry is struggling with the issue of reproducibility, as is biology and medical science.  The issue is reproducing others work isn't publishable, and if you aren't publishing in academia you are failing.

 Post your questions here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/365xeq/science_ama_series_im_luiz_rocha_an_ichthyologist/ 














 Today we announce a new feature in /r/science, **Science Discussions**.  These are text posts made by verified users about issues relevant to the scientific community.  

The basic idea is that our practicing scientists will post a text post describing an issue or topic to open a discussion with /r/science.  Users may then post comments to enter the conversation, either to add information or ask a question to better understand the issue, which may be new to them.  Knowledgeable users may chime in to add more depth of information, or a different point of view.  

This is, however, not a place for political grandstanding or flame wars, so the discussion will be moderated, **be on your best behavior**.  If you can't disagree without being disagreeable, it's best to not comment at all.

That being said, we hope you enjoy quality discussions lead by experience scientists about science-related issues of the day.

Thanks for reading /r/science, and happy redditing!

 




 ##**Science Verified User Program**

/r/science has a a system of verifying accounts for commenting, enabling trained scientists, doctors and engineers to make credible comments in /r/science . The intent of this program is to enable the general public to distinguish between an educated opinion and a random comment without a background related to the topic. 


#**What flair is available?**

All of the standard science disciplines would be represented, matching those in the sidebar.
However, to better inform the public, the level of education is displayed in the flair too. For example, a Professor of biology is tagged as such (Professor- Biology), while a graduate student of biology is tagged as "Grad Student-Biology." Nurses would be tagged differently than doctors, etc...

We give flair for engineering, social sciences, natural sciences and even on occasion music.  It's your flair, if you finished a degree in something and you can offer some proof, we'll consider it.

The general format is:

Level of education|Field|Speciality or Subfield (optional)

When applying for a flair, please inform us on what you want it to say.

#**How does one obtain flair?**


First, have a college degree or higher in a field that has flair available.
Then send proof to the mods of /r/science .

This can be provided several ways:

1) [Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fscience) with information that establishes your claim, this can be a photo of your diploma or course registration, a business card, a verifiable email address, or some other identification. All submissions will be kept in confidence and not released to the public under any circumstances. You can submit an imgur link and then delete it after verification. 

Remember, that within the proof, you must tie your account name to the information in the picture.


2) if you aren't comfortable messaging the mods with identifying information, you can directly message any individual mod and supply the information to them. Again, your information will be held in confidence.


3) Send an email with your information to sciencereddit@gmail.com after messaging the mods to inform them of this option. Your email will then be deleted after verification, leaving no record. 

This is convenient if you want to take a photo of your identification and email from a smart phone, for example.


Thanks for making /r/science a better place!
 
























 Starting on April 22nd, PLOS and /r/science will begin a weekly AMA series as part of the Science AMA Series to bring authors from the PLOS journals to reddit.

[See the announcement from PLOS here](http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2015/04/plos/)

PLOS, an open access journal, and /r/science, which does public review of journal articles, makes for a great fit, one that we are excited to bring to our readers.  

If you have suggestions or requests for AMAs from PLOS authors, email them to plosreddit@plos.org

Tune in every Wednesday for a new PLOS AMA!

 




 I've been trying to zone in on the fix for months, but I haven't had the time to really find the root cause. It's not the .organic-listing css, it's probably some inherited css from a different part of the stylesheet. 

I'm sure it's obvious to one of you, help? 





























 Post your questions here:

 Post your questions here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/31zpzy/science_ama_series_we_are_fred_whoriskey_and_sara/ 




 First off, I don't think this can be done, but I'd very much like to be wrong.

We in /r/science would like to track the number of readers who look at our AMAs, we get a lot of requests for the information and right now I have to email the admins and wait for them to get back to me with a number, I can't look at changes over time, or any other handy stats to let us know how people are using our AMAs. 

If we could embed a smart pixel via CSS we could gather some data on this, but it appears that all of the images that the subreddit CSS pulls need to be hosted on a reddit server, which would make our tracking pixel just a pixel.

Any thoughts on how to do this or am I stuck continually harassing people to get data?

 







































 Please don't submit them either, we are committed to keeping /r/science a serious discussion of science.  We know reddit just loves a good prank, but there are many other places to do so.

Yes, we totally hate fun.

 We should get the authors to do a  PLOS Science Wednesday AMA! 




 Science AMAs are posted early to give readers a chance to ask questions and vote on the questions of others before the AMA starts. 

Guests of /r/science have volunteered to answer questions; please treat them with due respect. Comment rules will be strictly enforced, and uncivil or rude behavior will result in a loss of privileges in /r/science.

If you have scientific expertise, please verify this with our moderators by getting your account flaired with the appropriate title.  Instructions for obtaining flair are here: [reddit Science Flair Instructions](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/flair) (Flair is automatically synced with /r/EverythingScience as well.)
 




 I will be giving the general rationale for our efforts in /r/science and discussing how everything fits together for the [American Chemical Society's Webinar Series](http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/acs-webinars.html)

Register for the webinar here (note there is a limit of 1,000 registrations, after which the overflow goes to youtube:

I hope everyone finds the discussion informative!

  Do you really believe they were ESSENTIAL for his success?

Absolutely, I'm sure he'd say the same thing.  

That doesn't diminish he hard work or his investment.  Without a market for Telsa's cars, he fails, and without the California Zero-emission tax credits, Tesla isn't even profitable.  There are stories told of how close Tesla was to going under, I believe a couple of months from not being able to make payroll (read bankrupt.)  

Building PayPal is significantly easier than a car company, and the sale price of any internet-based company should be weighted carefully (How much did What's App sell for again?  Does anyone seriously think a mobile phone app was harder to develop that a car company? Luck  and a good idea is a huge part of the internet success, in fact luck is substantially under appreciated in business success.)

Here's a story for you to read: [Tesla Is No Success Story
Tesla is only profitable thanks to politics and tax subsidies.](http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2013/06/03/teslas-success-is-the-result-of-political-favoritism)

Some quotes:

Tesla Motors, the California-based electric car start-up, has been the subject of a great deal of hype. With the recent news that it repaid its $465 million low-interest loan from the Department of Energy, it's now being heralded as a success story worthy of redeeming the failures of a green-energy subsidy program that has included the likes of Solyndra, Abound, Ener1, and Fisker Automotive. Since then, Tesla's stock value has more than doubled and the company is currently valued at around $12 billion.

and 

Even with the support of federal and state politicians, Tesla would still be reporting losses were it not for its ability to profit off of other auto manufacturers in California. In the first quarter of 2013, Tesla reported its first-ever quarterly profit by using special credits from California's Air Resources Board, which rewards auto manufacturers for the production of "zero-emission" vehicles. So far this year, Tesla was able to turn what would have been a $57 million loss into an $11 million gain by selling $68 million worth of these credits to other auto manufacturers in California.


Without a low-interest loan from the DOE, Tesla would have had some trouble getting started.  Sure he could have gone to venture capital, but they would have wanted a lot of control over the company, something Musk has been reported as being unwilling to give. 




 PhD chemist here, you are right.  "Simple" things are months of work. 




 You realize his efforts have gotten significant government support.  SpaceX is basically funded by a NASA contract, Tesla received a government-backed loan, and the sales of their cars are supported by a meaningful tax incentive.

It is unlikely he would have made it without the government, so this is probably a case of a perfect counter example to the libertarian dream.

 It's important to realize that, again, INCI names aren't chemical names, so several different materials can have the same name.

For example, acrylates copolymer can be any from a list of acrylate monomers and literally any molecular weight above 1500 or so. 




  put $1k towards a decent mortgage

Anyone who is making that much doesn't has a mortgage payment much higher that $1000, $2000 to $3000 for the mortgage is a lot more realistic. If you don't have a mortgage payment, you probably pay cash for an M4 anyway.  

That being said, you general analysis is correct, someone could in principle afford this, but it would be pretty dumb.  I believe most people who drive M cars lease them. (Assuming the majority of those with M cars aren't hobby racers.)  I suspect a majority of the people who drive them are business guys who want the appearance/status symbol. (that doesn't cheapen the car, just a society thing.)

 




 Because INCI names aren't chemical names, they are a nomenclature of their own. 

In this context "Alcohol" strictly means ethanol [as defined in the INCI database](http://www.cosmeticobs.com/pro/news/ingredient-of-the-month/alcohol-inci-alcohol-or-alcohol-denat-803)

 I believe so, you can seriously injure yourself if you screw up.  I think 5 mL of methanol is all that it take to blind you.  

Ethanol, you can drink an 8 oz glass and just have a bad headache the next day! 




 Pretty much. 




 Mercury is only used in one vaccination that children get, the DTaP, and the form used is not toxic to humans at anywhere near the concentrations used.

You could drink elemental mercury and it would pass right through you, the salts are substantially more dangerous because they are far more readily absorbed. 




 You are correct, they are both organomercury compounds, but different types.  Similar to ethanol and methanol, which are both alcohols, however they have drastically different toxicities.  A lot of ethanol os a drunken good time, 15 mL of methanol will kill you. 




 [Today, the only childhood vaccines that have trace amounts of thimerosal are: one DTaP vaccine and one DTaP-Hib combination vaccine.](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Concerns/Thimerosal/thimerosal_faqs.html#f)

So it's just the DTaP. 




 Actually, they didn't.  Aluminum is in there as a [adjuvent]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant) not a preservative, aluminum was already there. 




 It's important not to propagate misinformation however.  Also, the mercury used at a preservative in vaccines is a different compound of mercury, and isn't nearly as dangerous to humans.  

The mercury found in tuna, however, is more than a vaccination ever was and **is** the dangerous kind, methylmercury.  It's presence is largely the result of humans burning coal which releases mercury into the environment.

 There isn't mercury in vaccines anymore (with one exception).

 Oh he totally was, but Diaz looked worse, he looked inept.  It was the right response to Diaz's style, that's what you do to one dimensional fighters, take away their style. 




 Condit was point-fighting Diaz, too.

You could also look at this as exposing Diaz for being unable to adapt once his game plan was taken away from him.   




 This is an opinion piece, not research.

 I'm actually going to an NSF-sponsored conference in July to basically do this. (I believe meta conversations are called "Communications" in academia!) 




 At the American Chemical Society Meeting in March, I was interviewed about the Science AMA Series.  This is the video the ACS staffers put together, I thought people would be interested in seeing it.

This is before a webinar I am giving covering science discussions on reddit:

(I'll post a link to the webinar on the day of so that people can easily find it.)

Hopefully reddittors find this interesting and informative as to our motivations and values. (spoiler:  we're pro-science!)

 Way too much work for the admins to vet websites reddit wide, reddit is just too huge.  Also, if something bad would come up from a link on an "approved" site, would reddit still be able to claim safe harbor? 




 Every single one of your comments in /r/science has been removed for breaking various rules, you've ranged the gambit from inane and off topic to homophobic and insulting.

And now you're whining to strangers about how terribly oppressed you are.

 Thanks.  In /r/science, we have an unusual situation in that we have an incredible number of mods, 814 last count, which gives us a lot of internal review of mod actions without the drama of having a public mod log or anything like that.  Because /r/science is one of the most moderated subreddits we get a people who post thinking it's any old sub that they can make their shitty, off-topic, political comments in and get away with it.  They can't (and should not be able to, frankly.)

While we do have mods from many different back grounds, I assure you that we don't have a dramatic ideological bend beyond being pro-science, as in peer-reviewed science.  We aren't pushing any philosophical positions, mostly we try to keep them out.  That's why his comment was removed, he's making a glib comment that is pushing a personal position (which is seen in his previous comments.) 




 In /r/science, the only time we look at behavior outside is to confirm a track record of poor behavior.  ( posting on a racist subreddit would tend to confirm that a user is a racist for example.) 




 It's because of a history of bad comments by this user.  We give temp bans to get user's attention, nothing special here.  It was a shitty comment that offered little insight.   




 He received a warning because of his history of bad comments, most of them have been removed for being overly hostile or political in nature.  It's not just this comment in isolation.  

Sorry that we don't feel like getting into arguments with hostile users looking to screen shot our conversations for grandstanding.

/r/science is not a free-speech subreddit, we have rules, we enforce those rules. 



 




 He isn't banned, he's just not giving you the complete story, like leaving out the parts where he is reinstated and given a warning to make better comments in the future.  We issue short term bans to get people's attention, works doesn't it?

Not as drama filled that way is it?  

[Here's the real conversation](http://imgur.com/eYeAUpL)

Note the bit he left out at the end.

But by all means, don't let this interfere with your circlejerk and harassing messages.

 Is there a way to re-title things to make it less of an issue?  We can't add anymore categories as we are at the character limit for the sidebar, so that's not an option.  

I created anthro as a separate sections because it tends to be more field work/lab work oriented than other fields in the social sciences, in particular Physical Anthro, which looks a lot like paleontology to the untrained observer.  Cultural Anthro and linguistics, sure, they could slot right into soc without issue.  

And honestly, from my experiences, aren't all anthropology people just functional alcoholics?  Would they even notice? :-D 




 We love all of our children equally.

Quick count: 28 full mods.

How many active full mods?  how about we change the subject?  I like turtles.

 It's the first post to 50 votes, not the first post. 




 Hi drewiepoodle, your submission has been removed for the following reason(s)

It is a repost of an already submitted and popular story.

Although this was posted first, the other submission hit 50 votes first, which is the level at which we enforce the rule.

 Science AMAs are posted early to give readers a chance to ask questions and vote on the questions of others before the AMA starts. 

Guests of /r/science have volunteered to answer questions; please treat them with due respect. Comment rules will be strictly enforced, and uncivil or rude behavior will result in a loss of privileges in /r/science.

If you have scientific expertise, please verify this with our moderators by getting your account flaired with the appropriate title.  Instructions for obtaining flair are here: [reddit Science Flair Instructions](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/flair) (Flair is automatically synced with /r/EverythingScience as well.)
 




 Is that closer to rheology or tribiology? 

(Like I said, I'm not the one who knows about this stuff, and it's the difference of slightly different orange backgrounds on flair, anthro used to be in soc, so there are probably anthro people with soc css classes.) 




 Our resident anthropologists tell us that Linguistics is a subset of Anthro.

http://www.aaanet.org/about/WhatisAnthropology.cfm

Social Anthro, Physical Anthro, Archaeology and Linguistics.

None of these are subsets of chemistry, so I don't have a knowledgeable opinion.

  




 Yup.  There isn't really an easy way to further break down the fields since people put their particular area, not a subfield in the text.  It would have to be done manually by someone familiar with the fields separating each out.  Some of them would be pretty hard to classify as well!  

For example, we have people with engineering degrees who work on computer programs to analyze biology.  So which field are they in? 




 It's under anthro, we follow the North American standard.

I'll see about working up more specific data later tonight, this is jsut css classes, so it's very broad. 




 You have env flair, environmental science, which is a green color, you must have the css turned off. 




 We think of it as community moderation, the rules are written as objectively as possible and enforced by a group capable of dealing with a default, as is the mod to subscriber ratio in 1/10,000!

A smaller group would burn out from too much work, this way no one person is critical, people can do as much as they want or as little. 




 Also amusing, flaired users/total subscribers

2769/8,260,948 (currently) = 0.0335% so a little over 3 hundredths of a percent. 




 Some go in health, other go in epidemiology, it depends on what the best fit is. 




 It's under bio.  It's the css flair class, not the flair text. 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/science/about/moderators

/r/science actually has more mods that all of the other defaults combined, currently around 800. 




 That's some nice Excel work! 




 Publish or perish is quite the incentive, especially on a publication going to a small journal that few will read anyway.
