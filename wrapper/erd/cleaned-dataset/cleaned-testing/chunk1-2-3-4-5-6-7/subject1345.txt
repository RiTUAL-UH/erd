 Hey Nathan I am a huge fan and I've seen every episode. 

I just want to ask about the girl Rachel. Is that actually how she is or do you exaggerate the awkwardness for the camera? Also when you get her for more than one segment (The Hunk and Quiznos) doesn't she start to ham it up a little too?

Thanks for doing this. Favorite show on television
 




 I always pictured it almost without a face, and that's what made the face so memorable.

 I went last summer and my friend and I had the park to ourselves after 8:00. It really is worth the trip.
