 By relatively cheap I mean under $2,500. 














 It's not a perfect book. The mystery is actually the weakest part of it and the main character, Claire DeWitt, can be a little off-putting, but the whole thing is so unusual, mystical, thought-provoking, richly evocative of post-Katrina New Orleans and even occasionally laugh-out-loud funny, that I thought I'd give it a rec.

It's vaguely reminiscent of The Boy Detective Fails by Joe Meno, so I'm going to give that a mention too.

 You'll often hear people say something like "I (or a friend) doesn't really like reading, but I like book X." I think of these books as "books for non-readers" and I was wondering precisely what is it about these books that appeals to non-readers in a way that other books don't? 

Also, is a book that appeals to non-readers similar to books that I call "brain candy" -- books that are light and fluffy and silly and require no brainpower to process at all, mostly romances but not necessarily?

Your thoughts? 




 It seems to me that a lot of SF and fantasy today engages in excessive worldbuilding to the extent that plot and character development almost take a back seat to description. The most notable example of course is Harry Potter and I think this is the reason why when people finish certain SF or fantasy books they wish for more is because the worldbuilding is amazing but the meat of what a book is supposed to be is lacking.

By contrast, things like LOTR, Star Wars (the movies, not the expanded universe of books), WoT and GoT do not have such extensive worldbuilding. They tell a story and when it's finished, it's finished, and you feel satisfied with it. "I wish WoT was 20 books longer" said nobody ever.

Conversely, Discworld has fairly extensive worldbuilding but you also feel satisfied at the end of most books because Terry Pratchett is great at telling a story and giving you interesting characters. 

Edit: Now that I think about it some more, I see that I can't name as many series off the top of my head as I thought I could. My memory's been influenced by the many threads bemoaning the fact that people can't get enough of X or Y world that must make it seem more common than it is. But the point still stands that it is entirely possible to engage in excessive worldbuilding to the detriment of the characters and story. 









 As I was reading it, I felt like Mr. Mercedes was Stephen King's answer to the Cuckoo's Calling. When a character named Trelawney popped up, that confirmed it for me.

I think that Mr. Mercedes was the better book. Though Cuckoo's writing was a bit smoother -- some of the dialogue in Mercedes was eye-rollingly bad -- Mr. Mercedes worked better as a mystery. Stephen King uses all the conventional techniques and even comes up with a couple of new ones, while Cuckoo came across like Rowling didn't know the first thing about conducting an investigation. And while the characters are a bit silly in Mercedes, at least they're vivid. As soon as I put down Cuckoo, I couldn't even remember how the mystery got resolved, let alone anything about the characters.

I read that the Silkworm is better than Cuckoo and a sequel to Mr. Mercedes is coming out next year, so I'm hoping they both will be improvements.

 There are some authors who were turning out decent books up until they died and some that seem to have run out of ideas but keep churning them out anyway. Who do you think should retire or should have retired from writing? My answer in the comments. 









 First the good. Besides for the utterly boring first 70 pages and the weak, college freshman essay last 70 pages, most of the middle was fairly engrossing. Also, I laughed a couple of times.

Now for the bad. It was engrossing, but not good. The writing was weak and unedited, as judged by the spelling errors and inconsistencies, and by the plot errors and inconsistencies. She repetitively described New York using an overabundance of banal and seemingly randomly-chosen adverbs. 

The main character, Theo Decker, is a cypher. He tells us what he's feeling, but we never quite feel it ourselves. He doesn't particularly have much agency either. He mostly allows himself to get dragged around by whatever dynamic person who's around at the moment. 

The plot is incredibly weak and relies heavily on having a death every 200 pages to advance the story and/or a Dickensian coincidence. In fact, toward the beginning of the book, I was sure that this had to be a parody of Dickens, it was that bad. Later it seemed to be a bit of a Harry Potter AU fanfiction and when Theo's friend Boris starts calling him "Potter" and does so for the rest of the book, I felt entirely vindicated. There also a lot of retconning. She wrote the book over a period of 11 years and I think it shows. 

It's too bad the book didn't end with Theo successfully committing suicide. Then it might have been compared to Shakespeare or Greek tragedy and would be more meaningful for it. Instead we're treated to a long and pointless essay about art, which does nothing to life the book from its mediocrity. In 770 pages it says absolutely nothing original or insightful about art, humanity, or anything else. I am completely baffled why it won the Pulitzer. 

One positive review I read started with something like "I can't explain how much and *why* I liked the Goldfinch so much." If even people who like the book can't explain what they liked about it, it can't really be all that good. It might be appealing, but appeal and quality are not particularly correlated.  




 It's really supposed to be Burn, Read, Rewrite, but I don't believe in burning books, even for fun.

 I went shopping for Fathers' Day cards and by the end of the week almost all the "for father from daughter" cards are sold out while most of the rest are going strong. Who decides what cards to stock? Don't you think they'd notice from year to year which cards are the most popular so they'd stock more of those than the rest? Sometimes I wonder the same thing about milk in drug stores, but my guess is that milk is a loss leader so they don't care too much about that. But greetings cards are expensive!  




 There's a story behind this question but I can't remember what it is.

 When the critics like a movie a lot more, most likely it's artsy and a little dull. When the audience likes it more, most likely it's a dumb crowd-pleaser.

 It's a children's book that probably wasn't published later than 1985. It was about a boy that had a paper route but for some reason wasn't able to do it so his sister took it over despite the fact that people didn't think a girl could do it. I think I remember her having trouble collecting money from the people she delivered the papers to, and there was a dog, a chow, that bothered her and drooled a lot.

 I originally [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2191s4/amateur_shelf_reading/) about my amateur shelf reading in /r/books because that's where I learned the term, but apparently nobody there was interested, so I decided to give you guys a shot.

Last week I did some shelf reading at my library and found a bunch of misshelved books (see previous thread). I decided to do it again this week, but I only managed to get through three shelves on one bookcase because a library worker started hovering around and I felt self-conscious. 

So now I'm wondering if somebody noticed the post or they noticed the books I'd left to be properly shelved and had the brainstorm that maybe people who actually work there (whether as employees or volunteers) should actually be doing it? If so, it's really awesome that I made an impact.

This week I looked at Par- to Patterson. Most of the misshelvings were relatively minor, though I did find a Sarah Pekkanen in there.  









 If so, what book(s)? Or author(s)? 




 Plot summary from Wikipedia:

Five of St Aubyn's novels, Never Mind, Bad News, Some Hope, Mother's Milk, and At Last, form The Patrick Melrose Novels, republished in a single volume in 2012. They are based on the author's own life, growing up in a highly dysfunctional upper-class English family, dealing with the deaths of both parents, alcoholism, heroin addiction and recovery, and marriage and parenthood.

They're sort of depressing and nihilistic at times, but the prose is clever, funny, easy-to-read, and thought-provoking. The best books are the first and fourth, which are written from a child's perspective. 

The other books are weak (especially the second, which comes off like a re-written Bright Lights, Big City, and the third which barely seems to have Patrick Melrose in it at all) but despite how much you pity but also despise Melrose, you feel compelled to follow him on his journey. 

The last book is a bit old hat, like the author ran out of new things to say, but it ends on a high note that doesn't lie and say that everything *is* okay, but that it very well might be okay, after all this time, finally. So you feel glad that it really is possible to transcend even the worst kind of childhood and upbringing.

Highly recommended for people who are interested in the subject matter, particularly the British upper class.  









 How do you go about renting an apartment without a real estate agent? Aren't all the listings in the newspaper or Craigslist fake or get snapped up the day they're listed? 




 After the discussion last week about shelf reading and my admission that it was unlikely that I would ever formally volunteer at the library, I decided to do some shelf reading on an amateur basis. It was pretty gratifying and I intend to do it again.

I did this during my lunch hour so I only had time to look over two bookcases. The books ran Sta- to Stevenson. In the two cases I found minor misshelvings such as SteiNberg ahead of SteiMberg; SteelE ahead of Steel; a book of essays that nobody seemed to realize was non-fiction and will probably be misshelved for the rest of its poor little life (because good luck trying to convince a library worker that it needs to be reclassified); some slightly worse misshelvings such as Strohmeyer; also Inferno by Dan Brown. 

Yup, Dan Brown. In the S's. 

Can't wait to see what'll turn up next. 

ETA: There were other errors but I don't remember them all. Some misshelved books I put in the right place, others I left out depending on how easy it was to find where they really belonged. 




 I hope this is okay to post here; I figured you guys would be more familiar with plays than other subreddits.

(Background) I was writing a story that suddenly occurred to me would work better as a play, which is bizarre because while I've written a number of (unpublished) novels and took a couple of stabs at writing a screenplay, I've never been particularly interested in plays before. Plus, I've read plays, but I haven't seen too many performed.

(Question) So, what is your take on telling a story in a novel versus a play versus a movie format? Is there a particular type of story that lends itself to one format over another (aside from the obvious like action movies couldn't be plays)? What is the selling point of a play?

(Also) Would anybody be able to recommend to me plays with approximately five characters?

 Maybe the question doesn't really make sense, but I couldn't figure out how to phrase it better. Lately I feel like I've been reading two books around the same time that have nothing to do with each other but funnily have similar aspects or elements.

For example, Friday I read Where'd You Go, Bernadette by Maria Semple, which is a modern-day domestic dramady set in Seattle, and Saturday I finished The Abominable by Dan Simmons, which is a historical drama/thriller largely set in England and Mount Everest. But both books have a connection to Antarctica. 

I didn't read these two books together on purpose, in fact I didn't know that Antarctica figured into Where'd You Go, Bernadette -- I took it out from the library without even reading the book jacket. 

Has this happened to you? 




 Has been writing for a long time and/or has written a lot of books, and the opposite. 




 Seems they're trying to prevent people from crossing from the middle of the street, except I didn't see it stopping anybody but me because I was afraid the traffic agents would give me a ticket -- except they weren't paying any attention to what people were doing. (Do traffic agents even have the authority to give people tickets?)

Theoretically this is a good idea because far too many people cross when the turn signals are green and I'm amazed that nobody's gotten run over in front of me yet, but at the same time, the way this intersection is set up, if you wait to cross legally to get to the train station, you'll be waiting for much longer than if you cross in the middle. There should be a legal diagonal crosswalk light. 

I'm pretty annoyed right now.

ETA: And now they've added a big flashing sign saying not to cross, to use the crosswalks. Like, duh, as if people don't know that. But the traffic agents are gone.

 I'm reading Blue Has No South by Alex Epstein. It's a book of really short stories, flash fiction, I guess. I'm finding them incredibly hard to understand. Here's one story. What do you make of it?

The Man Who Lived in an Elevator

In his last years in the elevator old age had disposed of his hair (in the mirror he saw the reflection of a caveman whose hair was turning white). His children, who were ashamed of him, used to stop him on the lower floors and give him pictures drawn by his grandchildren.

 There was a recent thread that had a list of classic heroines and one of them was Katniss. The Hunger Games was published in 2008; it cannot possibly be considered a classic yet.

I was thinking that a book can't be considered a classic until it's been in print at least 20-30 years. In other words, it needs to be read a generation after it was published. (50 or 60 years would be even better -- two generations after it was published.)

And if you want to talk about a series, it's 20-60 years after the *last* book was published, not the first.

Your thoughts? 




 I remember a softcover science fiction novel that was probably published in the late 1980s or early 1990s. It had something to do with cat people and for reason, I'm thinking tea. I think the author's last name was toward the beginning of the alphabet.  









 I find that I prefer Russian, Japanese, and Spanish over French and German. Maybe it's the subject matter, maybe it's the translations or maybe it's the quality of the original languages themselves, I don't know.

 And by women's novels I mean stuff by people like Maeve Binchy, Elin Hilderbrand, Jodi Picoult, Fannie Flagg, etc. -- relatively serious books about women's lives.

I do not mean chick lit like Bridget Jones or the Shopaholic series. I also don't mean romance of any sort, whether hardcover or paperback.

 This past week I read Life After Like by Atkinson and First Sight by Steel and I rated them very similarly (3/5 stars and 3.5/5 stars respectively). 

Atkinson's book is ambitious, creative, and fairly-well written, but overall it's just not that good. The characters and relationships aren't engaging, the basic story has been done to death, and the most creative aspect of it didn't pan out in the end.

Steel's book is pretty bad, actually. It's a dumb romance, dumb characters, fairly bad writing. Though there were a couple of plot twists that I genuinely did not see coming and that's what kept me from rating it lower.

So in the end, I slightly preferred First Sight because I wasn't disappointed by it. I knew what to expect and pretty much got it. To me it feels worse to have my hopes dashed by a book that turns out to be overhyped. 

How do you feel about books that don't live up to the hype versus mediocre bestsellers that do what they're supposed to do? 









 I'm looking for creative ways of including movement/exercise in my day. I have a 9-5 desk job and overall I'm pretty sedentary. Currently I walk at least a quarter of a mile every day and stand at least an hour a day, on average.

Is it fair because not wanting to keep reading a book is a pretty good indication that there's something not good about it?

Or 

Does it depend based on what they didn't like about it?

 Agree, though MIT is a specialized science school, so I suppose it's a bit more prestigious in its field than Oxford or Cambridge, which I don't even know if they offer science degrees.  




 Interesting etymology of the -crat ending.

-cracy 

word-forming element forming nouns meaning "rule or government by," from French -cratie or directly from Medieval Latin -cratia, from Greek -kratia "power, might; rule, sway; power over; a power, authority," from kratos "strength," from PIE *kre-tes- "power, strength," suffixed form of root *kar-/*ker- "hard" (see hard). The connective -o- has come to be viewed as part of it. Productive in English from c.1800.

 Some of you might remember from a little while back that I was doing some amateur shelf reading. Someone recommended that I avoid doing non-fiction and I wholeheartedly agreed until today. I was looking for a play and discovered the non-fiction was in just as bad shape -- if not worse -- than the fiction.

The play I was looking for was listed in the catalogue as available but was nowhere to be seen. Which was not surprising considering what I found. It might have been anywhere. 

There was one thing I didn't understand. A dual-language book of poetry had the Dewey Decimal Number of something like Gle 891.621 N Dhomhnail. (I don't think this is the exact book, but it was a similar number.) I couldn't figure out what the Gle was supposed to mean so I just left the book on a shelf and hoped somebody who worked there would find its correct home, which, now that I'm looking in the catalogue, appears to be on a different floor entirely. 

I have the feeling that this poor little book will never find its home. And nobody will ever take it out because it's not where it's supposed to be and then it'll get weeded because nobody's taken it out in X number of years.

Oh the humanity!

 Absolutely. When I was younger I pretty much only got books by browsing the library shelves, but as I've gotten older, that hasn't worked out for me as well. So now I keep extensive to-read lists. 

Though I still love browsing. Looking at the different covers and reading through summaries are great, even if I don't even up taking the books. 




 It's actually recommended that you don't read right before bed because reading is stimulating -- it makes you think, and thinking can keep you from falling asleep. I have personally found that even a boring book can be stimulating. Once I stopped reading right before bed, I started falling asleep a lot faster.

In his autobiography, Tony Bennett claims to have created "...the first music video" when he was filmed walking along the Serpentine in Hyde Park, London in 1956, with the resulting clip being set to his recording of the song "Stranger in Paradise".[8] The clip was sent to UK and US television stations and aired on shows including Dick Clark's American Bandstand.[9]

 Here's a site selling them. They don't remotely scream "Jewish" to me: http://www.leelach.com/tichel/sinar-tichel.html 




 I watched the movie a couple of weeks ago and am currently in middle of the book. It's a very faithful adaptation so it really doesn't matter which you experienced first, and anyway, it's almost always better to watch the movie first. 




 I'm going in early spring. I'm interested in the arts, hopefully with a local flavor. 




  I love her for who she is, not because I have to as her mom.

I don't see the problem here. That's exactly how a parent should love their kid -- for who they are. In my opinion people who only love their kid because it's their kid are usually pretty messed up. Having both is ideal, but if you only can have one, I'll choose your way over the other way any time. 




 At my work, back in the day when they issued paper checks, employees were given an extra 15-minute break on payday in order to go to the bank. 

I'm not sure why "most people" in OP's question can't go to the bank during their lunch hour if this extra break isn't a perk they get. 




 It's been a while since I've read them, but IIRC in Very Bad Deaths and Very Hard Choices by Spider Robinson a character had uncontrollable telepathy and couldn't stand to be around anyone except this one guy. (Not romances.) I didn't like them as much as I wanted to, but I'd generally recommend Spider Robinson so long as you're willing to put up with blatant political preaching. 




 Thanks! 




 A bunch of university libraries and the NYPL have it. See if you can get to one of those libraries or if your local library can request it via interlibrary-loan. Unless you want to buy it for upwards of $100. 




 I've read books with that premise. Maybe not with vampires, but the person who can read everybody's mind except for that one special someone. 




 Thanks, but I guess I should have specified how is it that they play the game so well? I've played various levels of, say, Angry Birds, like 50 times and I'm lucky to get 1 star and they're getting 3 stars. 




 ETA: I meant how is it that they play the games so well? I've played a level of say, Angry Birds like 50 times and I'm lucky to get past it with 1 star, forget 3 stars. Sometimes I can't manage 3 stars even when I'm copying the walkthrough.  




 It's a relatively common phrase/sentiment that's been around way before the Office (started in 2005) and Reddit (started in 2005). 




 MI5 comes to mind. It's not "the MI5." 

Honestly, I don't believe there's any real answer to this aside from "that's just the way we talk," but certainly the answer is not "there needs to be a the." There doesn't *need* to be a "the." 




 That's not an answer. In America we don't say "the ABC" (American Broadcasting Company). 




 Yes, 35. And that's one of my problems with the books -- I don't get the feeling that Rowling has any idea what 35-year-old men are actually like. 




 Too old. Despite the fact that Strike comes across as old and grumpy and decrepit in the books, he's only 35. Dominic West is 45 and looks it. 




 Weird fonts. Right now I'm reading a book that looks like it came out of a mid-1990s inkjet printer. It's so distracting. 




 I'd say I read 90% genre fiction. Literary fiction almost always disappoints and I like to take my time with classics, so I tend not to read very many of those types of books. 




 See if your library has an interlibrary-loan service. 




 Ha-ha. 

"a recessed landscape design element that creates a vertical barrier while preserving views" 




 People who have trouble backing out of parking spaces usually taking 2-3 times the amount of time than usual.

Can't say I've ever seen this particularly. Though maybe they're being careful. That's a sign of a good driver, not a bad one.

People who insist on yielding to you when it's clear they have the right of way.

Have experienced this all over NYC, nothing to do with wealth or competence. People think they're being polite by yielding.

People who drive well below the speed limit in broad daylight and perfect weather.

Do you live in a city with a lot of old people?

People react much slower whenever the light turns green at intersections.

Yup, you live in a city with a lot of old people. 




 I hear it everywhere that it had a big influence on today's world.

Where have you heard that? In relation to what? 




 Da Vinci worked on commission. 

Galileo worked in academia.

Wikipedia is your friend. 




 Yup. I don't think the art linked in the pictures is particularly good. In fact, it barely qualifies as fine art. As far as I can tell it's the artistic equivalent of Muzak -- bland and uninteresting. 









 What are some things to do in the cities in the evening besides for bars and clubs? 




 NYC housing market -- Mitchell Lama is mentioned but not public housing? 




 Me too. It recommended the Monster at the End of This Book. While that's a super book, I'm not sure it follows as a recommendation based on my ratings.

Also, a lot of books I searched for didn't come up. Maybe they would have if I had the ISBN's, but I don't have time for that.  




 That's right. It's old school sexism. Huge difference between sexism and misogyny.  




 I had to look at the picture three times before I saw the swastikas.  




 "Lincoln, sometimes I think I've walked into a Quentin Tarantino move when I'm talking to you."

The Skin Collector by Jeffery Deaver. Not one of this best. 




 The Book of Raziel the Angel. I found it somewhere and thought it was cool, so I stuck it in my bag and never took it out. It's about two inches square and the print is so small you can barely read it without a magnifying glass. 




 but don't know enough of the back story to understand how it came about

So that's the thing. The person wasn't necessarily "involuntarily" put there like they were committed to a mental hospital, but more likely were pressured into going most likely because the family didn't want to and/or couldn't afford to take care of them at home. 




 It's not an old wives' tale, the toothbrush makers do suggest this, but it's really just their way of trying to force you to buy a new toothbrush. 




 French, German, Dutch.

Laotian, Tagalog, Malay.

So, the answer is that neither of these is a typical ending for either language group, they're just ones you can think off the top of your head. 




 Sure they do. I once interviewed with an editor of a mystery magazine. I don't remember how it came up but she said they didn't take stories from bestselling authors because they refused to be edited.  




 Nobody's perfect. I recently watched a news interview from the studio that the station also streamed online. When they went to commercial, the screen was supposed to go blank and the mikes were supposed to cut out, but the first time they went to commercial, the mikes stayed on. They kept talking. I don't think anybody embarrassed themselves, but what they said wasn't really meant for public consumption either.

Point is, the camera and the mikes are controlled separately. You assume that when the camera is off so are the mikes, but obviously it's not always the case and there's no little red dot to show you that the mikes are off. 




 In many cases, curing a disease would have to entail gene therapy and we're very very far away from that being a typical treatment. 




 Like anything else that people try to do, learning a language requires a bit of talent. Not everybody has it. So when they hear a foreign sound, they simply aren't able to recreate it. Or they can't hear that they haven't pronounced it correctly -- like being tone deaf and trying to sing. 

Also, not everybody learns a foreign language from a native speaker. My French teacher in high school was American and her French accent wasn't that great. So it's not like I had anywhere to learn a French accent from in the first place. 




 I can't understand that thinking. People I know either enjoy reading or they just don't read. I never knew anybody who felt the need to force themselves to read if they didn't enjoy doing it. 




 Psalms are always good for when you're feeling bad. 

I wouldn't recommend talking to a rabbi regarding serious psychological issues. It has nothing to do with respect for them, that's silly, they're pastoral leaders, it's part of their job to help congregants, but at the same time, if you're have serious issues, unless they're also trained in psychology, I don't think they'd have much to offer to you any more than a close friend would. 

Unless you're specifically interested in learning about Judaism and Jewish rituals. Then by all means, go for it. 




 Not everybody affiliates themselves with a denomination. They just recognize that they were born to Jewish mothers and then don't incorporate a Jewish identity into their lives in any way. Considering that Lisa Bonet and her mother both married non-Jewish men, I'm going to have to go with no denomination. 




 Why do people who read have to have goals? I mean, what are your TV goals for 2015? What are you music goals for 2015? 




 It's because if a series is successful, the editors stop editing. They just publish all what the author wrote and particularly when it comes to fantasy series, these authors have a tendency to be wordy.  




 There's really no way of knowing why it hasn't come out yet. Things were happening behind the scenes that prevented it from being published, that's all that's possible to say. At the moment it's scheduled to be released in July 2015. 




 HP wasn't good, it was a phenomenon. The next phenomenon will come around sooner or later but you won't be the right age group to appreciate it. 

The Percy Jackson series is almost entirely for preteens.

You say that like it's a problem. Not all books are written for teens, you know. 




 A while back I had this type of dream. I interpreted it to mean that I was going on the Internet too much and was yearning for it like an addict. 




 Good on you. 




 It's inappropriate, that's for sure. Considering your friend is 16, family counseling might be better idea than going into foster care. 




 I could use $1,000 right now, so yes. 




 I liked Infernal Affairs much better though I kind of got the impression that if I hadn't seen The Departed first, I might not have known what was going on. 




 Beats me, I thought Viggo was severely miscast.  




 Not that I particularly disagree with what's already been said, but my grandparents had opaque glass, so clear glass is at least partially just a trend. If you Google "frosted shower glass" you'll see that it's around. It's just not as popular as clear. 




 The difference is that Santa Claus has its origins in Saint Nicholas, who was a real person. There's nothing to believe there in the first place. It's just a story and everybody who isn't 6 knows that. 




 No.

This sort of thinking made me want to throw Divergent across the room. 




 I bought one, but I guess it wasn't good quality because all it did was give me a headache. And honestly I don't feel like spending hundreds of dollars on a lamp. 




 114 so far. Huh. That's on the low side for me. Though I will definitely finish at least 6 more by year's end. I already posted the best books, so here are my worst:

2.5/5 stars:

- The Monkey's Raincoat by Robert Crais

- Murder on Bamboo Lane by Naomi Hirahara

2/5 stars:

- The Contortionist's Handbook by Craig Clevenger

- The Death Trade by Jack Higgins 




 Entirely true, but might be more appropriate to post in /r/writing. 




 Definitely keep it. It can never hurt to work on yourself to be a stronger, happier, healthier person. 




 25% or less. 




 I only wear concealer to cover up the dark circles under my eyes and the occasional spot. Takes a few seconds. 




 Entirely depends when and where the person died. On someone's doorstep, probably pretty quickly. Under a bridge, not so quickly, especially in the winter. 




 Einstein's Dreams! Definitely go with that. In terms of readability, it's short and very easy reading, very easy to understand, but it gives you a lot to think about.  




 I don't use Goodreads, but I just checked a few of the books I've read recently against Amazon's ratings and Goodreads seems slightly more accurate. Not by a lot, but on Amazon, almost every distribution of ratings is the same: A huge amount of 5 star reviews and then fewer and fewer of the rest. While on Goodreads the distributions don't have any kind of pattern. 

But I don't really find overall ratings all that helpful anyway. Usually it's the 3-star reviews that have the most objective reviews and you can get 3-star reviews on both sites. 




 Agreed. He's projecting his own stress, unhappiness and resentment. While I'm unhappy with my work I'm not especially stressed (not a secretary, but still an underling). My bosses on the other hand, are super-stressed. They have high-power, high-pressure jobs and bosses that come down on them harder than anyone ever comes down on me if I mess up. They have a lot more responsibility than I do, and that creates stress.

When I moved into a windowless cubicle it definitely disrupted my sleeping pattern to the extent that it was night for me twice a day. Ever since I started taking Vitamin D about a month ago I've been sleeping better and losing weight without altering anything else in my life.  




 It is frowned upon.  




 How is obesity escapism?

Eating in order to drown your feelings is definitely viewed negatively. So is laziness, if it's excessive. 
























 Forget fallible, a person can remember exactly what he said but lie and say he didn't say it. If it's in writing, someone's going to make a much bigger effort in order to prove that they didn't write it or agree to it. 




 emergence 

I assume you mean emergen-c, which is just Vitamin C, which has absolutely no effect on cold or flu. Nor does it keep you healthy, assuming you get adequate Vitamin C from your food. 

Tell your wife you should stop wasting your money on it.

endemic 

Epidemic. 




 This seems more appropriate to ask in /r/askhistorians.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Proin auctor, ipsum sodales commodo interdum, ligula odio ultricies felis, id vehicula nulla dolor vitae nibh. Mauris a ligula nisi. Morbi nisi elit, posuere sed neque vel, congue commodo tortor. 

So this doesn't get deleted for being too short. 




 Because she's the one who sings Let It Go. 




 Wikipedia:

Evidence of dedications is provided back into the Classical antiquity. Besides the wish to express their gratitude towards a certain person, the authors often had also other reasons to dedicate their work to a particular person. Well into the 18th century, it was not usual for publishers to remunerate the authors; authors tended to be paid or remunerated as one element of a patron-client relationship, in which the author-client paid tribute, in the dedication, to his or her patron. A typical writer dedicated their book to a high standing personality -- to Frsts or bishops -- or to a city and tried to gain some money through this practice.[2]

In many cases the petitioner was lucky and received a gift from the patron. In some cases, the writer groveled before the patron and a formal dedication "contained often a very elaborate and submissive affection".[2] In some cases not only the authors tried to get some money, but also the printers tried through dedications to cover a part of their costs.

The dedication is not to be confounded with the handwritten dedication of a single copy: the presentation copy.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedication_%28publishing%29#History

I don't think it's essential at all. There are plenty of books that don't have dedications these days. If anything, I'd say author thank-you's have become longer and more popular, where it seems like the author thanks pretty much every person they've ever met.  




 Definitely. After reading Mr. Mercedes I came away with the impression that King has never actually encountered a black person outside of his imagination. 




  This just can't be confirmation bias

Of course it can. A sample size of three people that you know proves nothing.

My mother has so far lost probably 100 pounds and she's pretty much exactly the same as she ever was. 




 Also because Robin Williams committed suicide. If he hadn't, there definitely would have been less hysteria.

(TIL that Robin Williams's middle name was McLaurin.) 




 I read reviews and I definitely let negative ones put me off books. If I didn't, my to-read list would be 1,000 books long. As it is, there are still books on my list from as far back as 2009 that I still haven't read. You have to find some way to winnow things down. 




 I don't see any problem here; I do this all the time. The first book is usually the best one, so why bother reading any further?  




 Where did you hear about this? Googling it turns up nothing. 




 And this is why I don't consider listening to an audio book as "reading." You're not reading, you're listening to a performance. 




 I thought it was terrific but you have to have a certain frame of mind to enjoy it. If you're subscribed to /r/atheism, it's probably not for you. 




 Even though I've read a bunch of her books, I haven't actually liked any of them. They're basically all the same so if you didn't like one, you won't like the others. I never got the impression she was anything like Murakami or that she was trying to be like him. 




 This is what the Save button is for.  




 Assuming you're a man: When was the last time you shaved or waxed your chest hair?  




 Ask her who she's coloring her hair for: herself or for you. If she's coloring it for you, tell her you don't need her to do that and bam, $120 in savings. If she's coloring it for you and you do want her to keep doing it, maybe you are on the hook for paying for it. If she's coloring it for herself, then she definitely needs to pay for it herself.

As for the system, it sounds flawed because your girlfriend doesn't sound like she really wants it to be this way. Sooner or later she's going to try to rope you into to paying for something of "hers" again and you're going to resent it and she's going to resent it when you say no. You need to nail this down. And if she's not totally on board with it, you need to chuck it and come up with another system you can both live with. 




  My favourite is when the pull the "Well, you're not a parent..." card whenever any conversation about children and behaviour comes up...

If they say, "You're not a parent, so you don't know how hard it is," you can say, "I do know how hard it is. That's why I'm not a parent -- so I don't end up like you. I can't help it if you didn't know how hard it was before you made the decision to have kids." 




 I'm really surprised there are that many Jews in Seattle that they bother giving off. 




 I feel even worse since that's two mistakes in one. A misspelling and a hypercorrection 




 Can I expect it to be as gripping as Mr. Martins series?

No you can't. Turn back now. 




 At first I thought it sounded really interesting but then I read some reviews that said it was very poorly written, so I decided not to bother. 




 I'm not a student and I read about the same amount. It's about making time for reading. It's also about prioritizing reading. Instead of going on the Internet or watching a movie, read a book. Read during your commute and during your lunch hour.  




 You actually did something interesting, unlike OP who did next to no analysis. Most of these graphs are largely uninteresting and unhelpful.

I once did a study of the books that I read and found that they fell into three categories: Books of authors I'd read before, books that I added to my to-read list based on information I'd read in magazines or the Internet, and books that I took from the shelf of the library without knowing anything about them in advance. 

I found that I tended to like them in just that order, which lead me to taking books off the shelf much less often since it's much less likely that I'll actually end up liking them. Admittedly it means I might miss something great, but I'm willing to risk it considering my to-read list is around 300 books long. 




 As others have said, you just had a baby, give yourself a break especially since we're talking about a short amount of time.

But unlike what others have said, too much TV in and of itself is definitely a bad thing. There are a lot more insidiously negative messages than you might realize, it tends to lead kids to prefer passive entertainment, and if they're watching regular TV, they're being exposed to countless commercials telling them to consume, consume, consume. 




 I've seen 8 of these and only liked 2. Anime tends to be have slow pacing and in a longer format of a movie, they often bore me. That's why I generally prefer anime shows. And even then I've given up on some because they were just too dull.

I liked Read or Die. It wasn't the best ever, but it had an interesting premise that you don't see very often. If you haven't seen it, OP, check it out.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read_or_Die_%28OVA%29 




 There is nothing great about "anime" any more than there's anything great about "movies" or "television" or "books" or "music." They're animated movies and TV shows and they have just as much variety as any other art form. 

What can be cool, though, is that for Americans, Japanese culture, mythology, and sensibilities are foreign and often seem odd, so that can be particularly interesting. 




 Kite was soul-destroying. Not recommended. 




 It's a religion and an ethnicity, but not a race since Jews can be of any race. 




 The current list has been extended to 2016 so they won't give the test again until after that. 




 I think you need to say exactly what you're thinking and not mince words in an effort to spare his feelings.

"Honey, I love you, but these days you're feeling more like a roommate than a boyfriend. I have sexual needs and it's upsetting that you don't reciprocate. But please, be completely honest with me and tell me your feelings on this subject and let's see how we can work this out together."

If he squirms and won't give up an answer, you need to press him. If he still won't answer, then if you're still interested in the relationship, make an appointment for couples counseling. If he won't go, then you either have to accept him for the way he is or break up with him.  




 I could see a great animated movie made based on this premise.  




 This really makes no sense. What sort of "lifestyle change" involves something that makes you a "quitter" if you stop doing it aside from smoking (which isn't a bad thing)?

And it's just generally terrible advice. The longer you live a lie, the harder it is to correct it without making yourself look bad.

 This is not an ELI5 question. 




 Except that Tacitus was born 20 years after Jesus died, so regardless of his motivation, he had no first-hand knowledge of Jesus' existence. While Democritus is referenced by people who were alive at the same time, who actually knew him and his extensive body of work. Jesus didn't leave behind any writings. 




 I don't think it does, it's just our perception. In other words, you face only changes minimally from year to year but the increments eventually build up to where they're finally noticeable.  




 It's basically a lazy technique to make a movie longer when they don't have enough plot or a good enough idea for a related subplot. But if it's done well, it can be helpful for developing a character by showing other aspects of their personality that aren't revealed in the main plot. 




 Imagine an avalanche. Can you tell the snow that it's stepping on you? If you yell for help, will the snow help you? Of course not. And a stampede is the exact same way. This mass of people is now behaving more like a mass of inanimate objects than they're acting like a group of individual human beings.  




 You don't. You usually feel worst at night because that's when your fever rises.  









 This is so true. On a recent ELI5 a completely wrong answer got like 10 upvotes because nobody around here has heard the real truth about it.

And the Reddit circle jerk loves certain "facts" that have been debunked or at least severely criticized, such as polyphasic sleep. They keep repeating information about it like it's a solid fact and it ain't.

ETA: Downvotes! Thank you all for proving my point. 




 Actually, they just planted a bunch in my parents' neighborhood in Brooklyn. 




 In case you're interested, I got a response: If you have your browser set too big or too small, it automatically switches over to the mobile site, so try playing around with the settings to get back to the old version. 




 Never knew he was so hot.  




 It's generally supposed to go by your father's side but there are all kinds of exceptions to the rule, particularly if you were brought up with your mother's customs.  




 WTF. How on earth does something like this happen? 




 Heh. And ouch.  




 The best mother that I know went back to work six weeks after giving birth. She's great, her kids are turning out great. 

I don't know any good mothers who stayed home.  




 you might end up skipping one that you could have really liked and never know. Pretty much just chance and risks.

There are so many books in the world -- you have to make choices somehow.  




 I bolded my main point. In the end, it's not really about WoT but the fact that I'm tired of reading (or watching) a series and then not have it pay off in the end. 




 Just regarding the writing, Brandon Sanderson didn't have a good handle on the language of WoT. I felt like he used a lot of anachronisms.

As for the story: There were major character deaths that barely merited more than one sentence. 

There was a 900-page battle with this group of people that barely had a single mention in the past 13 books and really had nothing to do with anything. Why was book a 900-page battle? How about a story? With a plot?

And worst of all, Rand's final win against the Dark One had really no impact whatsoever. I read it like three times and I was like, that's it? The same with the breaking of the seals. It was the opposite of epic.  




 What other methods are there? Storyboarding? It would just take too long and be too difficult to storyboard all movies and TV shows. It also wouldn't allow for flexibility; you hear about so many movies being re-written as they're being shot so that would be a problem. 




 1. So that nothing falls in by accident.

2. So that when you flush, the misted water doesn't spray all over your bathroom. 




 Even though studies seem to show that sugar does not make kids hyperactive, most parents will swear that it does. It's not specifically soda, but anything with a lot of sugar in it. 




 That was a really bad last book. Not as bad as the finale of Lost or the last book of Harry Potter or the last few books of the Dark Tower, but definitely one of the worst endings that I've encountered. Lots of other series that I've heard ended badly I've avoided, and this is why even though I read and liked a Game of Thrones, I'm not reading any more books until I find out that the series ends well. **I will not be suckered by a fantasy series ever again.**

The one thing that WoT has left me with is mild PTSD. Every time I see the word "shifted" in any context, I flinch a little.

ETA: Maybe some spoilers below, but trying to avoid it because I don't know how to use the spoiler tag properly. 




 Huh and now it's back? It seems to depend on what computer I'm using?

I just e-mailed them to complain. 




  doing it that way makes the tweet your own (with your avatar), rather than the person you're retweeting.

Exactly. It's the Twitter version of karma whoring.  




 Yes, sleeping for very long periods of time is definitely correlated with poorer health including increased heart disease and diabetes.

 How exactly do they find the statistic of false rape reports?

Here's a Wiki article that talks about various methods: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accusation_of_rape

The problem here is that you insist on calling someone who was either proven innocent, or where the case was dropped due to insufficient evidence, a rapist.

Well, as I said before, rape is a difficult crime to prosecute in many cases and it is very rare for a person is shown to be factually innocent, so it is safe to say that the vast majority of cases where a man or woman claims to have been raped, it is most likely to be factually true.

As more and more people are educated about the availability of rape kits and dna tests

Except the problem is that more and more rapists are using condoms in order to avoid DNA tests.

Honestly, I don't know what can be done about all this. I don't like anything people are saying these days about rape prevention. None of it seems remotely helpful. But I'll be damned if I can think of anything better. 




 You can give them your last name as their middle name. All of them. So if your name is Jane Doe you can name your kids Eleanor D. Smith and Robert D. Smith, the D standing for Doe. It is absolutely traditional to do this. Just look at JFK and RFK. Their mother's maiden name was Rose Fitzgerald; their middle name was Fitzgerald. 




 You can use his last name in social situations without formally changing your last name, if you'd both agree with that as a compromise. This way you can get Mr.   Mrs. Smith invitations but still have Jane Doe on your credit card or passport or work ID or whatever and nobody in your social circle has to know. 




 I think you're being overly sensitive or even paranoid. Your own description of your relationship sounds very nice, so the next time someone compliments it, say, "Thank you, you're right, I'm a lucky woman," and that should be the end of that. There's not much for someone to say after you've agreed with them. 




 It's horrible. Half the features aren't there anymore. Is this just the mobile site? Is there any way of getting back to the old version? 




 I was looking at the bag and wondering how you knew she was carrying baby heads in there.  




 They're stupid? They're masochists?

I don't know, when I smell something bad, I do everything I can to try to not smell it anymore. 




 I don't know why you think this. Zero population growth is usually a disaster for the economy because an economy needs to grow in order to be strong. A stable population means the economy wouldn't be growing, it would be stagnating or even shrinking. 




 It's because society teaches men to have large but fragile egos, and their self-worth largely rests on their ability to get a good job and provide for their families. So when their spouse is richer/smarter/more successful than them it's a blow to their ego and their self-worth. 




 Maybe bin Laden wasn't the best example, but he's what popped into my head. My point was that if we really had ninjas like Jason Bourne you'd think there would be a lot more dead bad guys.  




 Is it weird that this made me think of the Thundercats logo? 




 The check-out woman at the grocery store... No thanks. 




 Complete fiction. If it weren't, Osama bin Laden wouldn't have been so hard to find and take down.  




 So, you're telling me that of the 46 that are reported and only 12 are arrested, that the other 34 as well as the 54 that were not reported are definitely rapists?

As I just posted in another thread, the incidence of false rape reports is considered to be from 2-10%. So if you want to say of the 46 reported rapes, 4.6 are false reports, that still leaves 41 reported rapists. And when you include the 56 rapes that aren't reported, which even if you want to reduce that by 10% as well, that's still 3 out of 91 rapists who do jail time. 

Rape is a crime that is very hard to prove and it's not helped by the way rape victims are treated by system. 




 A few things that haven't been mentioned: Kids take their cues from their parents. So in a lot of families, the parents aren't eating healthy, but they try to force their kids to eat healthy. A big thing is to model for your children healthy eating.

Another thing is not to give them unhealthy snacks or meals more than once a week and to reinforce to them that unhealthy foods are a treat that you get on special occasions. I know families that give their kids unhealthy snacks every day or let them have soda with every dinner and then wonder whey their kids don't want to eat their vegetables.

And finally, a lot of parents don't start feeding them normal food when they're very young. But that's when you have to start -- as soon as they are old enough to eat real food. Unfortunately too many parents wait until the kid gets older and by then it's too late -- they're already used to the taste of bland pap.

So to sum: Eat healthy yourself, start the kid young, don't regularly indulge their desire to eat junk.

But if it's already too late and they're already a bad eater, you're basically stuck. There's very little way to undo it short of extravagant bribes, and even that I have found does not work on very picky eaters. 




 "Seem" is the operative word here. False accusations of rape get a lot of attention, especially on Reddit, but in reality, they are rare, with estimates ranging from 2-10% of all accusations. 




 Not a thing here contradicts what I said that 97 of 100 rapists don't go to jail. You seem not to understand that just because someone hasn't been convicted of rape doesn't mean he's not a rapist. 




 the infographic shows that 97% of those convicted never spend a day in jail

No it doesn't. It says that 3 of 5 convicted rapists do jail. What I posted is that 97% of all rapists don't do jail time. That number includes rapists who were not convicted.

The infographic says: of 100 rapes, 54 are not reported. Those rapists don't do jail. Of the 46 that are reported, only 12 rapists are arrested, 9 are prosecuted, 5 are convicted, and 3 do jail. Three of 100 rapists do jail time. 

Your link and edit don't contradict that in any way. 




 You have to be more specific. I'm not looking through four links to try to find what you're referring to. 




 You've never laughed so hard that you've cried? You're missing out.

 Microserfs and Jpod, both by Douglas Coupland. They might be a little dated, technology-wise, but they're both excellent. 




 I read 37 of these, though I know that I tried to read some of them and didn't like them, so didn't finish them, so let's round it off to 45. But come on, Stephen King is 30 years older than me. In 30 years I'll have read more books too. 




 Only three out of every 100 rapists will ever spend even a single day in prison, according to a new analysis by RAINN of Justice Department data. The other 97 will walk free, facing no consequences for the violent felony they have committed. 

While the percentage of rapes reported to police has risen in recent years, a majority  54%  still are not reported, according to the Justice Department. But increasing reporting alone won't solve the problem: only about one out of four reported rapes leads to an arrest, and only about one out of four arrests leads to a felony conviction and incarceration.

 No, it never stops until you get really old. You're married, not dead or blind. 

It's funny, my married friend has had more crushes since she got married than she ever did before she got married. At least for her, I think it's a stress thing -- a way of diverting her attention away from problems that can't be helped, like, say, a new bad boss at work.  




 Chewing helps too. Try to swallow something large without chewing it first, you're going to either gag or choke.

 According to what I linked, Tokyo's density is 11,300, while Osaka is 13,700. I never heard of Warabi and it's not on the table. 

According to Wikipedia, it is very dense at 14,000, but it has a low population. All the cities on the table are megacities. 

Japan is larger than Italy and nobody thinks of Italy as being a particularly small country. Rome's density is 5,800. 




 Japan and China are large countries and they still have incredibly dense cities. Europe is not dense at all. Though, Mexico City is twice as dense as Tokyo.

 Anna Karenina. 




 I recently read the Emily Starr books and I could not believe how insane they were. Subversive, even. I would never give them to a kid to read. 

But I agree, Emily starts to get really boring in the last book. Her decision not to go to big city with that woman editor was truly idiotic, and then deciding to marry a man she doesn't love, even worse. 

Ilsa was fun. Maybe there's fanfic about her? 




 At best it's a book packager. At worst it's a self-pub company that's willing to gamble that a few hours worth of superficial editing will net them enough sales to make it worth it. 




 According to Amazon, it's not being published by a real publisher. I don't know why he thinks it is, so he's not going to be any help. 




 Generals used to become president all the time. The last president who was a general was Eisenhower and it makes perfect sense. He was a general during the last "good" war. Who'd elect a president who a general during the Vietnam War? Or the recent Middle Eastern conflicts? Not a sterling record to run on. 




 They aren't. They have their own set of problems. The healthiest thing is to avoid all of them as much as possible.

 The Russian Sleep Experiment

That's not a real thing. Nothing about it is true.

http://www.snopes.com/horrors/ghosts/russiansleep.asp 




 Sleep deprivation almost always leads to weight gain for a few reasons. First, it messes with your body's ability to create ghrelin, which helps regulate hunger, second, you have less energy/willpower to resist foods that you know you shouldn't be eating, and third, depending on what sort of sleep deprivation that you have, for example, if you have late-night insomnia, you may find yourself eating more than you normally do because you're awake more. 




 Unlike other comments, I don't think it's meant to sound old, I think it's meant to sound foreign. But instead of hiring actual Greeks with actual Greek accents, they just go for Brits who also have the benefit of having more well-known actors and being native English speakers.

And honestly, I'm starting to see the wisdom in this. I watched the first episode of Marco Polo yesterday and the accents were all over the map because the cast was from all over (America, Australia, Italy, England, etc.). It was a little distracting.  




 It depends what movies you're referring. Seth Rogen movies are funny but they're intentionally not that good. They're just meant to be a silly good time. Or B movies that are meant to be over the top and ridiculous and exploitive. 




 Are the parents still married? In which case, do they want to get a divorce? Because this is how you get a divorce. A married person doesn't sue his spouse if he doesn't get his way. 

It's impossible to say how it would go down. It really depends on a lot of circumstances: there will probably be a psychological evaluation which will have an impact on the ruling, and various state laws will have an influence as well. 




 I watched the first episode on Amazon and I liked it, so I thought I might read the book it's based on, but the reviews really flummoxed me. On Amazon reviewers are split between loving it and hating it and and on Goodreads most reviews are in the "meh" range. I can't remember the last time I couldn't figure out what to expect from a book based on the reviews.

So, has anybody read it? Any thoughts on what made this book so apparently controversial and divisive? 




 I'm about a third of the way through. It's boring. And I loved Treasure Island too, as a kid. 




 They are all flawed. Cuckoo's Calling is the worst of the three. Gone Girl starts strong and ends poorly, while Mr. Mercedes has some weaknesses all the way through but ends pretty well. Pick your poison.  




 Did you see what I quoted? 

But if you don't like that, here are a couple of other sources:

It would appear from Numbers 31:2627 and Deuteronomy 20:1011 that prisoners of war could be, and were, taken into bondage, but it has been contended that no prisoners of war were ever taken into private slavery (Kaufmann, Y., Toledot 1 (1937), 651).

http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/slavery.html

In Kadmoniot Ha-Halakha, Shmuel Rubinstein (Kovno, 5686) writes (chapter 22): The gemara (Kiddushin 25a) teaches: 'There are twenty-four protruding limbs of a person, for all of which a slave is set free, and these are: the tips of the fingers, toes, ears, nose, penis and breasts... Rabbi says: Also testicles. Ben Azzai says: Also the tongue.
The situation of a slave in ancient times was truly awful. He was like an object owned by his master, who was free to do whatever he wanted in order to force the slave to perform hard labor day and night, and to use him for all kinds of perverted purposes. The master could beat his slave mercilessly for any major or minor wrongdoing; he could permanently maim his limbs without fear of any punishment. For any purpose desired by the master, the slave could be blinded. Herodotus writes (4:2) that the Scythians used to blind their captive slaves so that they would work in producing butter. And there were several other such purposes for which slaves would be struck with blindness, TO THE POINT WHERE PUTTING OUT EYES BECAME A SYMBOL OF SLAVERY. Likewise, prisoners taken in war were blinded as a sign of slavery, and this was done particularly to kings and officers of the defeated army, as a sign of revenge and enslavement. For the same reason, Shimshon was blinded by the Philistines (Shoftim 16:21), and this is apparently also the meaning of the words of Nachash the Ammonite to the men of Yavesh Gil'ad: By this condition I will make a covenant with you: if you all put out your right eye (Shmuel I 11:2), as if to say, In order that you will be slaves and prisoners of war to me. For the same reason, King Tzidkiyahu was blinded by Nevukhadnetzar (Melakhim II 28:7), and this is also the meaning of the words of Datan and Aviram to Moshe, Will you put out the eyes of those men? As if to say, Are we considered in your eyes as slaves, prisoners of war, that you will exert your power over us and to do us whatever you wish, to drag us wherever you decide? This arrogance on the part of the enslavers seems to have lasted until much later times, explaining even Herod's blinding of Bava ben Buta (Bava Batra 4a).

  In fact, the entire concept of a POW is largely a modern development

It's not. 

Here's an interesting essay: http://www.academia.edu/3291535/_Rise_Up_and_Kill_Him_First_On_Modern_Attempts_to_Create_a_Jewish_Ethics_of_War_Nova_et_Vetera_10_2012_pp._1183-1213

Goren finds the Talmudic and Mishnaic sources more relevant to moderntimes in their debates regarding issues such as the treatment of prisonersof war and of enemy fatalities:

The ethics of war of any military in the world is demonstrated prima-rily by two categories: (a) the treatment of war prisoners; (b) the treat-ment of enemy fatalities. The contrast between the behaviour of thePeople of Israels army and the other armies at the time, regarding boththese issues, are outlined in the Bible and the Talmud . . . there is clear evidence in the scriptures that the People of Israel treated prisoners of war, including those of foreign armies, mercifully . . . This behaviour was well known among the nations of the world which were neigh-bours of the People of Israel . . . 




 I think it's very easy to make a case for either side and have it be in line with halacha. Have it be in line with what's considered modern values is a different issue.

 As for torture of an enemy soldier for information, while it is obviously unpleasant, I can't see any reason why it would be different from all the other things we do in warfare when necessary. (If you can kill someone, you can certainly torture him.)

I don't believe that halacha addresses this directly and as such, is open to a wide variety of legitimate conclusions on both sides of the issue.

 Because the word "like" means "similar to

That's exactly the meaning, as I said already -- they're conveying the tone and meaning that's *similar* to what the person said, but not their precise words. 




 I can see two possibilities for why she might be doing this: Either she's not hungry or she's playing a game that she thinks is funny. 

If it's possible that she's not hungry, you might try delaying her feeding time by half an hour or so and see if that makes a difference. 

If she's playing a game, you have to put your foot down and tell her that if she spits out a bite, you can't give her another one. And if she spits it out again, you take her out of her chair, tell her that dinner is over, and you walk away. This should get the message across more than just telling her over and over again that spitting out your food isn't a good game. 




 How so?

 I think you misunderstood what I was saying. My point was that OP was misunderstanding the nature of small businesses -- they're not all McDonald's franchises with 30 workers that you can take advantage of by paying them low wages. Many of them employ only the owner or the owner and his family -- and those aren't people whose wages you're going to want to skimp on.

 Unless the murderer was a contract killer for hire, they killed someone for their own personal reasons and don't have any interest in killing people as a day job. If they were a serial killer psychopath, doing executions just isn't going to be satisfying in any way.

And if the person was a contract killer for hire, he wants to be paid an awful lot of money for his services. A lot more than the state would be willing to pay. 




 Like you said, tradition. The languages and instruments available way back  when set constraints on what their music was going to sound like, so that became the traditional music of that culture. In today's day and age, everybody makes the same bland pop music and traditional music is considered quaint or boring or folky.

 You're talking about a person who is currently gaining weight. I'm talking about a person who is maintaining their weight. When you maintain your weight, whether you're eating 1,000 or 4,000 calories, it's 4,000 calories in, 4,000 calories out. If you start walking and have 4,000 calories in and 4,100 calories out, you will lose weight. 




 Trying to explain that weight loss is really nothing more than calories in vs out to some people is like talking to a brick wall. My mother seems to think she needs to start doing crunches. No. You need to eat differently and exercise.

Well, not necessarily. It is calories in, calories out, but if you can effectively change the calories out, you don't necessarily have to change the calories in. So while crunches certainly aren't going to do anything, but if a sedentary person starts walking half an hour a day without altering how much they eat, they will lose weight. 




 Um, what? You don't need proper nutrition to maintain your weight, you only need calories.  




 I disagree. LOTR is tough reading; ASOIF is easy reading. LOTR is high fantasy, ASOIF is low fantasy as it de-emphasizes the traditional fantasy aspects.

 Not that I doubt that this is true, but how do they compare with religious people of similar ethnic, economic, and regional backgrounds? Not to mention the fact that in some parts of America, it takes a bit of guts to be secular, so it wouldn't at all be surprising that people who don't care about following the crowd aren't sheeple and don't just fall in line with what other people are thinking and doing. That's not about religiousness or secular-ness, but personality.

TLDR: Did they take into account confounding factors?

 Sometimes knowing what you want to do is instinctive, but sometimes it's about sitting down and asking yourself what your interests are, how you envision your future life, and what you're willing to do to make that happen.

A lot of people don't really know themselves, didn't pay that much attention in school, haven't gotten much guidance from counselors or teachers or parents, and are frankly unable to imagine that someday they're going to have to pay for their own Internet connection. So when you feel like a perpetual adolescent, there's no real pressure to figure out what you're going to do, especially since sometimes what you're *going* to do isn't necessarily what you *want* to do, but it'll pay the bills better than what you *want* to do.

 The article is about a woman who lost a baby and six months later she was still grieving and depressed and she thought there was something wrong with her because she hadn't gotten over it yet.

I'm stunned that anybody would think this. From the article:

[Kubler-Ross's] model is still deeply and rigidly embedded in our cultural consciousness and psychological language. It inspires much self-diagnosis and self-criticism among the aggrieved. This is compounded by the often subtle and well-meaning judgment of the surrounding community. A person is to grieve for only so long and with so much intensity.

Really? Do you think this is broadly true? I think that most people know that losing a baby is about one of the most traumatic things a person can experience.  









 I have 300 books on my to-read list and I always have twice as many books at home as I could possibly read in a week so this pretty much cannot happen to me. 

One thing you can do is make a list of authors that you like and read their entire back catalogue.  




 Hopefully you're getting help for that.

But even if you can't choose (or change) how you feel, you can choose what you say. So if next time you want to turn down a piece of chocolate cake, you can say, I'm trying to eat healthier, instead of saying, I'm on a diet because I'm so fat.

 Twilight and Dragon Tattoo were both supposed to be examples of popular bestsellers, and if you think that about Dragon Tattoo, I imagine you don't tend to like any popular bestsellers. If that's not the case, what would you name as a good popular bestseller?

I think either is a good example of a typical bestseller. Twilight is YA and Dragon Tattoo is a translation and honestly, I question whether it would have been published or at least have been as big a seller if the author hadn't died. Good examples? John Sandford, John Grisham, Mary Higgins Clark, Maeve Binchy.

I thought Lisbeth was a believable character, and of a kind that we don't get to see very often: a woman who is ferocious, who fights back for herself even though she has been shat on basically her whole life, who is probably on the autistic spectrum.

I didn't find her believable at all. To me she came across as roboticly strong except when the author needed her to be pathetically weak. And she could not have been on the autism spectrum or she could never have done that undercover thing.

It was wish fulfillment in the sense that Larsson did wish his magazine would get as big as Millenium, but that's a much more interesting wish than "oh I want this 'perfect' creepy stalker vampire boy to like me".

 I don't like the high/middle/lowbrow framing because it implies that there is some objective scale of taste determined by how smart a book is.

I'm not sure what you mean by smart. The "brows" are pretty well-defined. Low-brow is romance and James Patterson, middle-brow is your typical bestseller, and high-brow is literary. It has little to do with quality or goodness, though 99% of low-brow books are pretty bad, but probably an equal number of middle- and high-brow books are also bad. Just because something is literary, doesn't mean it's any good.

 To me, good taste is more like being able to identify the best in a given genre in as many genres as possible.

That's even more subjective.

good taste is knowing the difference between The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and Twilight

While obviously Dragon Tattoo is better than Twilight, pretty much everything that's ever been published is better than Twilight, so that's not saying much. Good taste is knowing that Dragon Tattoo is overhyped, overlong, sexist, and a Gary Stu wish fulfillment fantasy just as much as Twilight is a wish fulfillment fantasy.  




 At least we're talking about the same thing. I'm going to have to say the opposite as you -- since you're not used to hearing it, you don't hear the fine distinction.  




 Read half of them. Dragon Tattoo and WWZ are wordy trash. Mr. Penumbra is like a children's book. 

Murakami's Norwegian Wood is literary but still easy reading and Margaret Atwood's Oryx and Crake is literary and SF to draw in people who generally prefer genre writing. Though maybe Children of Men by P. D. James might be a better suggestion along the same lines.

 Someone you confide in and who confides in you is your friend, so you have friends. You just aren't a social butterfly. Nothing wrong with that. You might feel more normal if you developed friendships with other introverts, though. Are you in school? Then pick the person in your class who seems the least interested in talking to anybody -- they're probably a fellow introvert.  




 Two books that I can remember not finishing (off the top of my head):

- The Complete Cosmicomics by Italo Calvino. It started out clever but then it kind of got repetitive and annoying. 

- The Long War by Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter. Just plain boring. I blame Baxter. 

As for books I did finish, the worst book I read was The Contortionist's Handbook by Craig Clevenger. Thanks for nothing, Redditors who recommended it. Even though it was a short book (like 200 pages), it was still 180 pages too long. It would have been a good short story. 




 I don't like the word "good" in this context. I prefer highbrow, lowbrow and middlebrow because I know people who who likes classics and that's considered good taste, but I don't think they have good taste in books at all -- they just happen to like overly wordy and descriptive writing. In other words, it's just a personal preference, not a recognition of the value of classic literature.

I think I have critical middlebrow taste. I read a lot of popular bestsellers and the like, but I rate most of them as being average and not particularly good either because the story is bland or hackneyed or otherwise uninspired and/or the writing is.  




 It's not about fiction versus non-fiction, it's about books that have meat to them versus books that are just fluffy entertainment. If you're reading books that you felt were a "great time," then of course you won't feel the same way the second time around. Books that stand up to re-reading are ones that you felt had deep personal meaning or significance. 




 I don't think anybody's hating on him, I think it's just surprising because it's so random.  




 I don't really think this is an appropriate question. You might try to encourage him to be more complimentary when you look especially nice or when you've done a particularly good job of something, or to be more thankful when you do things for him, or just to say "I love you" more, but for him to enumerate precisely what he likes about you... that smacks of "does this dress make me look fat." 




 You might want to check out this similar thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2rt1ha/me_27f_with_my_husband30m_of_3_years_ive_married/

In your husband's case, he may have trouble with motivation because he's been institutionalized by being in the military. They tell you when to go to bed and when to get up and when to eat and when to work and it's hard to have to do these things on your own. But he's had two years now, it's time to have a serious talk about his life and your relationship.

It's not that American women don't find Asian men attractive, they just don't fetishize them the way American men fetishize Asian women, so it doesn't stand out as much. American women definitely find Asian men attractive.  




 Huh? On BBC Sherlock, Mycroft is played by Mark Gatiss, who is gay. Not nude that I've seen.

 And I've been working for 15 years and have known people who've lied on their resume and have not only gotten the job, but advanced further than I have in the same amount of time and nobody ever found them out.

It's not that I really think people should do this, I'm just angry and bitter over what I see as a completely unfair hiring process, and HR professionals even admit that it's absolutely useless for finding the "best person" for the job, but nobody's willing to replace it with something better. 




 All of these comments from HR people about not lying on resumes is the biggest bunch of crap ever. Lie your head off. Nobody checks. As long as you can successfully BS the interview, you're golden. Until you wind up as CEO and then they look into your resume and find out you didn't graduate from college the way you claimed to. Then you'll be fired. But otherwise, a good BS resume will get you a lot further than an honest resume unless you're amazing. And if you're amazing, you're not reading this thread for resume tips anyway. 









 There is. Just Google Rod Ferrell book. 









 I'm surprised Gravesend is the most expensive of the southern Brooklyn neighborhoods.

One of the most surprising bits of data was the Syrian orthodox enclave within Gravesend. While Gravesend averages $470/sq.ft., the section between Avenues S and U, averages $2,000 per square foot. Houses sell for $1012M, putting it among the most expensive neighborhoods of the city by median price. (And if one simply averaged the entire neighborhood, this interesting enclave wouldnt be visible. At a time when developers and brokers are creating unnecessary new neighborhood names to promote emerging areas (the cringeworthy ProCro and Bedwick come to mind), this area constitutes such a different market that it actually merits a different name.

Oh. So they cheated, in other words.

I'd like to see all the neighborhoods in a chart. The maps aren't really that helpful. 




 I don't really subscribe to "fit at any weight" because I think too many people use it as an excuse not to lose weight, but I don't think it's impossible to be true, either. Just like there are people who smoke all their lives and live to be 100.

In other words, not all healthy people are thin. Healthy people come in all shapes and sizes. 




 You actually have to work very hard to be famous. It's not just something that happens by accident. There's a difference between being successful and being famous.

For example, when Benedict Cumberbatch was just doing Sherlock, he was successful and had a certain amount of fame on the Internet, but the general public had not idea who he was. Then he went and got a part in half the movies that came out this year and his face is everywhere. Now he's famous. 




 Sure I have. In fact, in one of them I couldn't see a thing. And the reason why it didn't matter was because it was free. If I'd've had to pay, I would have been pissed. 




 It's certainly part of it.  




 If you just wanted to hear her voice, you could just listen to her songs -- why bother going to a concert? 




 For example, Sia performed with a bag over her head. She says she's about the music and doesn't want to be famous. But she is world-famous and a huge seller. So when people go to a concert of hers, they want to see her performing. Not the back of her head or a paper bag.

So, while I can understand her desire to be authentic and not a sell-out, is it really "fair" to keep acting like she's still a small indie musician once she's attained this level of success? 




 Good point. We shouldn't be testing young models, we should be testing those 40 and up.  




 Yeah, waist size is not the gold standard for deciding whether someone is healthy or not. Let's see some blood tests, blood pressure, cholesterol, that sort of thing. But even if those come back normal, that's not saying much. Models are mostly young and young people can abuse their bodies and not have the effects show for years before it catches up to them. 




 It's by Ian Fleming, in case people don't know. And, the script of the movie was by Roald Dahl (and Ken Hughes). 




 I don't know, maybe I misunderstood what you were asking since I've never heard anybody do this.  




 That's correct usage.

You just have to take out the other person's name to see if the sentence still works. "I went to the whorehouse for a good time" versus "Me went to the whorehouse for a good time." 

So take "The restaurant gave John and I a discount" -- "The restaurant gave I a discount." Clearly doesn't work, so it's "The restaurant gave John and me a discount."

 I agree with this, but my concern with a close relationship is: What happens if OP and mom break up? Will OP still take the time to be a "Big Brother" to her? 




 I don't understand the double standard.

 It's because the taxes are different on wholesalers than on retailers. So it's not that they're banning resale of their goods, they're saying: If people are buying our stuff in bulk and reselling it, the taxes are their problem, not ours. 




 What retailers ban resale of their goods? In the US there is only the right of first sale. Once it's sold, it's not theirs anymore and they have no right to dictate what you do with it.

 This is true, but eventually they will get old and not be so pretty and not get this kind of attention, and from what I've read, it can be devastating to their self esteem. There's a reason why some of these women go to extreme lengths with cosmetic surgery and Botox. 




 There is definitely a difference between a regular thermometer and a rectal one:

 Everything that's been said already is correct, but colonel is an exceptionally strange case.

1540s, coronell, from Middle French coronel (16c.), modified by dissimilation from Italian colonnella "commander of a column of soldiers at the head of a regiment," from compagna colonella "little column company," from Latin columna "pillar" (see column). English spelling modified 1580s in learned writing to conform with the Italian form (via translations of Italian military manuals), and pronunciations with "r" and "l" coexisted 17c.-18c., but the earlier pronunciation prevailed. Spanish coronel, from Italian, shows a similar evolution by dissimilation.

 I can't think of a single series I've been glad to have finished. Wheel of Time, Dark Tower, Harry Potter, regretted them one and all. Even Hitchhikers got progressively worse and I certainly regret bothering with the books that Douglas Adams didn't write.

 I don't know where you live but I literally went card shopping three hours ago and hardly any of them have ribbons or bows.

 You're asking two different questions. Your body knows when you've had enough water because the cells that need the water are filled, and your thirst goes away.

But what inhibits you from drinking more? Nothing. You can drink water until you die and nothing in your body will physically stop you from doing it.  




 Nobody owns the rights to Bible stories so they can make Moses whatever race they want. The same goes for historical events. Nobody owns history.

 If you have a market-rate apartment (not rent stabilized or rent controlled), they can increase the rent however much they want. There are no legal restrictions. 

But it's not arbitrary. They need to balance making a profit against the likelihood that someone will pay the increased rent. If they raise it too high above other comparable apartments in the area, you might move and nobody else will rent it. If they raise it too little, they won't feel they're making enough money. 

Most likely they will raise it $100 a month or thereabouts. 




 A Noahide is allowed, but not required or obligated, to mark the significance of the  Seventh Day in some ways.

http://asknoah.org/essay/the-seventh-day

So if they don't observe it they're not really missing anything they're obligated to do.  









  For the religious Jews, their calendar is the right one, and everyone else is observing the wrong holy day.

Not true. Non-Jews have no obligation to observe Saturday or any other day as the Sabbath. If they follow a religion with a different Sabbath day, there's nothing wrong with that. 

Here's how Christianity's Sunday Sabbath developed:

 Within the 12% of North Americans who claim left-handedness, there are some interesting demographic variations. As regards gender, men are slightly more likely than women to be left-handed, with most studies indicating that about 13% of men and just under 11% of women are left-handed (men are NOT twice as likely to be left-handed as is sometimes claimed). It has been suggested this occurs because girls are more receptive to social mores and more likely to conform than boys (although there may also be a genetic component).

 Fifty Shades of Grey is the only "spin-off" of Twilight that I can think of  that has been especially successful. And it didn't do it by mimicking Twilight the way Charlie Bone mimicked Harry Potter. So no, I didn't respond to the wrong comment. I disagreed that the reason why Charlie Bone wasn't successful and Harry Potter was had anything to do with the series growing as its audience did. 




 It helps, but I didn't think it's the worst thing in the world if you don't. Even though they do sometimes reference things that happened in previous books, they're not strictly a continuing story so it's not hard to follow along. 




 Charlie Bone was too similar to Harry Potter, that's why it didn't take off. 50 Shades of Grey is extremely different from Twilight.

 There is no doubt that cops are better than they were, say, 50 years ago, it's just getting more attention now. The Rodney King incident happened 24 years ago; the Watts riots were incited by a police brutality incident 50 years ago.

But even if anxiety has only gone up since 1993, it's part of a continuing trend, not something that is distinctly new about the 21st century.

 Pandora's explanation:

Free Pandora accounts permit 6 skips per hour per station, for up to 24 total skips per day across all stations. The daily skip limit helps us prevent having to pay royalties on songs that are not being heard.

Upgrading to Pandora One increases your 24-hour skip limit, but does not remove the skip limit entirely. You can learn more about Pandora One here.

A skip is considered to be a skipped song, a Thumbs-down rating, or choosing "I'm tired of this track" in the menu of the music player.

Licensing is one of the most expensive aspects of providing the service, and we must pay the full royalties for a song, even if it only plays for a few seconds.

  One for example I found by looking at the "What's New" feed at Internet Archive - they add a few thousand new books a day, all very old and very obscure. One day I just decided to read one. No had ever reviewed it on Amazon, Goodreads or anywhere else on Google search. I was the first person in the age of the Internet to post anything about it. The last review of the book was from 1912 when it was published. 

What book was it? 




 Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco. So many old/Christian terms I'd never heard of.  




 Boring or execrable writing. And forget halfway through, I'll put a book down on page one if I dislike it that much.

  I never knew that there were romance novels from the male perspective. 

Me either. The only thing I can think of that comes close is lad lit, the male version of chick lit.

Though last week I read Graveyard of Memories by Barry Eisler (a thriller) and there was a romance in it from a male point of view. It was just as unrealistic as any romance from a woman's point of view.  




 Never up until now. I'm planning on reading the Hobbit and there are so many editions. The problem is that Tolkien actually revised the book after it was published and I want to read the last revision, but the book descriptions don't always make it clear which version the printing is of.  




 They are just sluts. No need for any qualifications. That's why I have no problem with this word. It's a behavior men and women engage in and both can be described that way and both are disgusting. 

I finished the Unbearable Lightness of Being this week and the main character admitted to sleeping with over 200 women. He is a slut, period. That's not a D I'd want to go anywhere near. 




 Would you rather have an ice cream scooped out with a clean ice cream scooper or one that was used on every other flavor and never washed?  




 Caleb Carr has written a number of books.

I just finished the River of Souls by Robert McCammon today. I basically had to force myself to read it and I really wish I hadn't bothered -- it didn't pay off in any way in the end. It felt like a bridge book to the next one and the writing was so dull.  




 So you mean "what book you discovered by accident." And yet, even when I'm looking for new books to read, anything I come across can arguably be called "by accident" since I wasn't specifically searching for *that* book. You can't search for a book that you don't know exists. 




 I thought it was a great book, best one they "forced" me to read in high school.

 Nobody's perfect. But I'm not seeing how saying al hamichya is in any way analogous to having sex.  




 You're one person. I was once on a program on a kibbutz for a few weeks. The shul was literally right there, the weather was beautiful (in other words, no good excuses for not going). By the end of the program, out of 20 people, only two were still going to shacharit. So you're one of the two. But the other 18 are the normal ones. 




 Only if you're in kollel. Otherwise, just having to get early to get to minyan before work is a heroic feat. 




 Nobody's perfect, but remembering to say al hamichya is hardly impressive. A better example might be going to minyan three times a day every day. If you do that, that's impressive. 




  Are all singles "equal" (for lack of a better word)?

For this particular conversation: Yes.

 Yes, that's the halachic ideal, so is saying al hamicha after eating some oreos. And how many times have you done that?

Every time? I don't understand this point.  




 Again, my point was that some wigs make the wearer look overly attractive

You are absolutely correct and even some rabbis that allow wigs frown on or speak out against these overly sexy creations. Looking good is perfectly tznius; looking sexy isn't. Looking sexy is absolutely forbidden.  




 The Outsiders (S. E. Hinton). I watched the movie once when I was a teen and once when I was older, thinking a little distance from the book would make me not hate it, but nope, still thought it was terrible.

 Or Wizard's Hall by Jane Yolen. Interesting that the Books of Magic and Wizard's Hall came out within a year of each other. Clearly this was an idea that was percolating and Rowling caught the bug too, only it took her seven more years to put her book out.

In 1991, the author Jane Yolen released a book called Wizard's Hall, to which the Harry Potter series bears a resemblance. The main protagonist, Henry (also called Thornmallow), is a young boy who joins a magical school for young wizards.[74] At the school "he must fulfill an ancient prophecy and help overthrow a powerful, evil wizard."[75] However, Yolen has stated that "I'm pretty sure she never read my book," attributing similarities to commonly-used fantasy tropes.[76] In an interview with the magazine Newsweek, Yolen said, "I always tell people that if Ms. Rowling would like to cut me a very large check, I would cash it."[77] Yolen stopped reading Harry Potter after the third book, and has expressed dislike for the writing style of Harry Potter, calling it "fantasy fast food".[77][78]

 Something you might keep in mind that lately there's been a huge backlash against creative writing courses, particularly MFA degrees. I don't remember their exact argument, but it's easy enough to Google. 




 I certainly didn't understand the difference at that age.

Were you were even taught the difference? Nowadays they have "bad touch" lectures in schools. When I was a kid we didn't. We got the rape lectures in high school but child abuse was a taboo topic. 




 I think children of capable of understanding the concept of "bad touch" versus "I find this really annoying but I'm willing to put up with it because old person." 

I saw your comment below in the thread and at least where I'm from, boys are much more likely to get their cheeks pinched than girls. It's a different dynamic than you (and possibly) OP is describing. So if the touching comes off as creepy it would be better to tell to stop, but pinching, while not fun, is clearly harmless.  




 Would you be interested in a critique of the entire novel? 




 I once took a creative writing course (adult ed, not college) and I found it completely unhelpful. Each week we focused on a different aspect of writing (e.g., character, plot, description) and we had to read a short story that illustrated this technique, write a little in class and do a homework assignment. Maybe because one week per technique wasn't enough or maybe because I'm not the kind of person who can produce a story on demand, but I felt this was completely unhelpful.

Though I did eventually develop a story idea that has a ton of potential and I've been writing about it ever since, so at least I had that going for me.  




 That I lived with my parents. Too embarrassing. (Thankfully it's not the case anymore.) 









 It doesn't just taste bad, it smells bad too. 




 It depends what sort of community you live in. Where I live, this is very typical old-person behavior. And actually, it's worse than touching or patting, it's usually cheek-pinching, and kids hate it. But at the same time, I do feel like it's the sort of thing you just have to put up with.  




 Thanks, putting it on my list! 




 This is completely untrue. Popcorn is actually quite healthy and has tons of nutritional value. It is an excellent snack.

And the facts speak for themselves: a single portion of popcorn contains more antioxidants than all the fruit and veg most people eat in a day, as noted in a study by Scranton University. Antioxidants keep molecules harmful to cells in check, and are present in many fresh fruits and vegetables. Popcorn also has a large amount of vitamins; folate, niacin, riboflavin, thiamine, vitamins B, A, E, and K, as well as being a source of iron, potassium, zinc, and polyphenols which contain the antioxidants to fight off cancers and cardiovascular health problems.

 This article is a mess. 

The reason why relationships can't be based on explicit exchange is because hardly anybody can handle the truth about themselves or anybody else. Not too many people are going to be honest about their failings as a friend or partner, and in any event, most people are willing to put up with their loved one's failings even to the extent that they put up with abusers.

But it's also because in every relationship, there's always somebody who loves/gives/does more and somebody who loves/gives/does less because there are no two people who are exactly alike and are in exactly the same circumstances. 




 Books similar to Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series? 




  4 wisdom tooth. 4. Can't be taken out because they are mostly horizontal.

Why does their being horizontal mean that they can't be taken out? 




 Different reasons. 

Fat doesn't conduct heat well, so while it does insulate your body, it feels colder to the touch. So wherever you have larger fat stores, those parts will feel colder. 

Another thing is that your hands and feet are more likely to have poorer blood circulation than the rest of your body so they're more likely to feel cold.  




 How would you know these sounds are happening in real life unless they're waking you up? That means that at the time they're happening, you're actually minimally awake and shaking off the dream you just had and it feels like the sounds are part of the dream, but really you're just hearing them IRL. 




 There were tons of crappy books being published one hundred years ago. You're confusing 1908 with 1708.

 I know a couple just like this and my sense is that the wife doesn't really care about their finances because she doesn't think they'll ever really need that much money, like a downpayment for a house, and she's really too young to begin to understand the concept of retirement, so she figures, so what if we live paycheck to paycheck and enjoy ourselves, life is going to be like this forever.

It might be helpful to sit down and work out what your long-term goals are, including buying a house, paying for your kids' college education, and having a decent income in retirement. Then maybe she'll understand why saving is a lot more important than she realizes. 




 Seriously? I feel like there's been a massive change from 2000 to now. The rise of the SJW, the fact that everybody on the Internet is stealing from everybody else, the massive amounts of pessimism about the future, etc.

No, there are Muslim Arabs and Druze elected to Israel's parliament. 




 Minimum of 40 hours. In other words, sure, I'd love to work four 8-hour days, but 32 hours often isn't considered full time.

  Maybe I'll work Monday through Thursday.

That would be the best thing except that I can't handle 10-hour days. I've  done it and it's left me a complete wreck. And if working full-time means working 40 hours, I'd rather stick with Monday to Friday. 




 Because even if recycling creates a certain amount of pollution, making new paper and putting old paper in landfills creates even more. 




 That is weird.

 You really think that anybody who named their kid Isidore had any idea what it meant? Though it is an interesting question how such an ugly name like Isidore became popular. Similarly Morris, Ira, and Irving. 




  if you have rule out any name associated with a saint, that's a lot of names. 

Yes, that's right. Traditionally Jews gave their children Hebrew names and then at some point they added Yiddish names, which tended to be translations of the Hebrew name. Like Tzipporah-Feigie, which both mean bird. And then when English names came around, they tended to give English translations of the Hebrew names like Rivka-Rebecca. 

I've known Jewish people with Gaelic names and all kinds of European names, so it's odd that Nicholas specifically would be off the table.

Nicholas isn't off the table. Like I said, if you eat ham and cheese, it really doesn't matter that much what you name your kids.  




 I have a couple of friends who have Fridays off for different reasons and the way it works is that Thursday night is for shopping and Friday is for preparing for the Sabbath. They never use those times for leisure activities. (One is single and the other is married with children, so you can't even say that it's the fault of their situations. Their situations could not be more different.) 

If I were offered the option of having off on Friday but not Sunday, I would not take the offer.

And for secular people, they'd adjust to having Sunday off instead of Friday pretty easily. Considering that hundreds of millions of people around the world have off on Sunday, it's not like this is some kind of impossible thing to deal with.  




 Since you posted this 18 hours ago, I'm going to assume you're not a Sabbath-observer. As a Sabbath-observer, having Friday off does not make more sense. While it's nice to be able to have the whole day to prepare for the Sabbath, that's exactly the problem. The only thing you can do (especially in the winter) is have time to prepare for the Sabbath. So if you want to go to the beach in the summer or hang out with some friends or go to a concert on Saturday night, you're not going to be able to do that.

Having Sunday off works better regardless of whether you're a Sabbath observer or not. 




 You should be thinking about the meaning of the prayers that you're saying. And if you can't do that, just concentrate on the words themselves and blank out your mind to all other thoughts. 




 Google "university press" and look at their websites. As a clinical psychologist, you must subscribe to journals...? Look into those...? 




 It's a name that's strongly associated with Christianity. So any Jew who really cares about being Jewish and transmitting the tradition to the next generation would not give their child that name. Anybody who's a ham-and-cheese Jew will do whatever they want.

From the Greek name  (Nikolaos) which meant "victory of the people" from Greek  (nike) "victory" and  (laos) "people". Saint Nicholas was a 4th-century bishop from Anatolia who, according to legend, saved the daughters of a poor man from lives of prostitution. He is the patron saint of children, sailors and merchants, as well as Greece and Russia. He formed the basis for the figure known as Santa Claus (created in the 19th century from Dutch Sinterklaas), the bringer of Christmas presents.

Due to the renown of the saint, this name has been widely used in the Christian world. It has been common in England since the 12th century, though it became a bit less popular after the Protestant Reformation. The name has been borne by five popes and two czars of Russia.

 Sounds like your best bet would to try to work for an academic or general non-fiction publisher that puts out either scholarly or popular non-fiction psychology titles. With your background, it will be extremely hard to get hired as a general editor or book reviewer.

Though you do realize that these are not comparable to what people are typically complain about? The slow walker. The person who suddenly stops at the top of the train steps.

 "Seem" is the operative word. I've definitely had pimples come out during the day. You just tend not to notice the difference in your face from one hour to the next, but a break of eight hours makes it pretty obvious when you've got a new spot.

 This is best of? Seriously?

Most people are craven sheeple and it's not remotely surprising that when somebody in power tells them to jump, they ask how high. It's a lot harder to figure out why some people act truly selflessly, putting themselves at risk in order to help or save others. 

When somebody explains that, that'll be worth a best of. 




 I thought that was his mother. 




  A Discovery of Witches

I was considering reading that series. Skip it, then? 




 Which books? Titles? 




 Because they want to live on the Upper West Side the same way that you apparently do. And the UWS is not even one of the most expensive neighborhoods in Manhattan either, especially once you get out of the Lincoln Center area. 




 Don't take cabs.  




 Yeah. I don't remember doing homework ever, though there must have been. 

I also didn't get particularly good grades, especially in high school. Seems to me that doing homework helps build a work ethic and keeps kids from coasting on their intelligence.  




 Recently finished Whatever by Michel Houellebecq. It had an unnamed narrator, but it was a really short book so it didn't matter. Too bad it wasn't as good as it could have been.

The beginning was an absolutely vicious skewering of office life and office workers. The middle had a touch of American Psycho to it. But then the end just petered out into nothingness. Perhaps that was part of the point, but it had more of the feeling that Houellebecq just didn't know how to sustain the story.  




 Have you read his other early books The Chocolate War, I Am the Cheese, After the First Death, and The Bumblebee Flies Anyway? They are so good and so disturbing. His later books were weaker.

Some other YA authors who don't get any love here: Ron Koertge, Pete Hautman, Kathe Koja, and Paul Zindel.

 Then how do you use it? 




 Yup, Kingkiller Chronicle.

Not fantasy/SF, but the romance in the latest John Rain book Graveyard of Memories by Barry Eisler had a whiff of "have you ever even talked to a girl?" about it, except that Eisler is married, so clearly the inability to write a decent romance is not necessarily about a lack of personal experience.

 Some of them are counterfeit, some of them are refurbished but don't tell you that, some of them are older/discontinued models, some of them were originally purchased with stolen credits cards so it didn't cost the seller anything to buy... so many possible reasons. 




 No. Just go to Europe where men regularly sit with their legs together and crossed at the knee, not at the ankle. This is entirely cultural, not physical.

 Nobody knows. If they did, breast cancer testing wouldn't be as controversial as it is. When they pushed early detection they found more and more cancers but it didn't seem to save a commensurate amount of lives. Why? Because it turns out that a significant number of these cancers would have resolved themselves on their own and had they not been found through testing, nobody would have been the wiser. So instead we save a few more lives, but put a lot of women through hell for nothing.

Problem is, nobody knows once a tumor is found whether it will resolve itself or not so the thinking see-saws between earlier testing and later testing. 




 This is seriously untrue. In some countries women are killed for saying they were raped. In some they're not allowed to drive. Or go outside without being escorted. Or go outside without being covered from head to toe. Forced into marriage in their teens. Have no right of divorce.

 Wikipedia's source actually says there were up to 6,500 Danish Jews and 1,300 of their non-Jewish children through mixed marriage. Of these 7,800 people, 580 didn't escape and 464 of them were sent to Theresienstadt.

Though other sources do give other similar, but not exactly the same numbers.
 




 OP's article says there were 7,800 Danish Jews, so clearly the number hasn't been pinned down exactly, but it's certainly below 10,000.

ETA: See below. 




 It's really disgusting that OP's grandma wrote a sweet and lovely card and grampa gets props for basically signing his name.  




 I think I misunderstood your comment earlier, and possibly other people did too. Upvoted now, for what it's worth. 




 First, there were very few Jews in Denmark, about 6,000, compared to about 140,000 in Holland, and more than 3 million in Poland. Most of them were so assimilated as to be indistinguishable from other Danes. 

http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/13/countrymen-untold-story-denmark-jews-escaped-nazis-bo-lidegaard-review 




 There is an old Kabbalistic belief that at any given time, 14,400 Righteous Among the Nations (Gentiles who are willing to help Jews).

I don't know where you got this number or definition from. There's a concept that there are 36 righteous people among the nations in every generation and they "sustain the world." It has nothing to do with helping Jews.

There's another concept that any non-Jew living in (ancient) Israel and was pious was called "righteous among the nations."

And finally, the phrase "Righteous Among the Nations" is what Yad Vashem calls non-Jews who helped Jews during the Holocaust. It's not kabbalistic, it's just a slogan that they appropriated because it sounds good. 




 What it really means is that Danish Jews were so assimilated that they were barely identifiable as Jews anymore. So while what the Danes did was a good thing, if the Jews had been less assimilated, they might not have done it.  




 If you live at home, you have to move out immediately, if not sooner. If not, then you simply have to stop talking to your mom about men and realize that she cannot prohibit you from doing anything because you are an adult.

 Normally I downvote all "should I read the book or watch the movie first" questions because the answer is almost always "watch the movie first so that you're not disappointed if it doesn't live up to the book" but I'm upvoting this because funnily, I have that movie out from the library right now myself and I totally forgot that it was based on a book. So, upvote for reminding me.

 You're right, but at the same time I don't disagree that my writing lacks heart. I think it's a valid criticism.  




 Maybe I'm not writing with a burning passion but I don't think most professional writers are. They always say that you're not supposed to wait for inspiration, you're supposed to set a schedule and stick to it.

I can't do both. I can write in an inspired way but inspiration isn't going to sustain a novel-length work. Or I can write a novel methodically and apparently not have any heart. 




 I don't think the Martian had any heart at all and I couldn't have cared less about about any of it but it wasn't boring, so I kept reading. But most people seemed to have loved it. 




 I read On Writing a long time ago. Seems like it's time to read it again. 




 I'm looking at m-w.com now and I don't see that definition. Could you link it? 




 Even 95% heart and 5% head can work.

Sure, but now it's the opposite way around.

Of course it's a metaphor but the idea is that I'm intellectualizing too much. And the person who said this wasn't wrong at all in her assessment.

You know who writes like this a lot? Orson Scott Card. Occasionally Brandon Sanderson does too. 




 That's advice someone gave me recently. Has anybody else ever gotten this advice? How did you deal with it?

I'm not sure this is something I'm capable of doing. Maybe I should consider changing genres to something like SF where writing from your head is prized (I'm thinking of books like The Martian). The problem is that I don't read SF too much anymore and have no story ideas for it.

 If the house is up to code, then I'm 100% right.

Why do you have any reason to believe the house is up to code? Again, you have never seen this house, have no idea what condition it's in. To tell somebody that something is okay without having examined it yourself is the height of irresponsibility. 




 Most 

Most is not all. 

That electrician saw this house and you didn't. You're the moron. 




 That's not safe. You're not supposed to use space heaters with extension cords.

http://www.safeelectricity.org/information-center/library-of-articles/51-heating-safety/101-space-heaters

As I said below, I know somebody whose house burned down from an electrical fire so I don't think this is something to take lightly. 




 I really don't understand why you're arguing. I'm sorry this is not something you're familiar with, but this is a matter of safety for yourself, your family and anybody who might be living with you or in your building. It's not something to be defensive about because you've never heard of it.

Do not overload circuits. Never use extension cords or multiple plugs with a space heater, and make sure the unit is not plugged into the same circuit as other electric appliances.

If your space heater is plugged into a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) and the GFCI trips, dont assume there is something wrong with the GFCI. Immediately stop using the 
heater until it can be checked by a professional if not, a serious shock could occur.

http://www.safeelectricity.org/information-center/library-of-articles/51-heating-safety/101-space-heaters

During use, check frequently to determine if the heater plug or cord, wall outlet, or faceplate is HOT! If the plug,
outlet, or faceplate is hot, discontinue use of the heater, and have a qualified electrician check and/or replace the plug or faulty wall outlet(s). If the cord is hot, disconnect the heater, and have it inspected/repaired by an authorized repair person.

 You cannot Google what's inside your house. I have a friend whose house burned down from an electrical fire. The "story" is not implausible at all. Space heaters are notorious. But you want to Google? I Googled. First result: Space heaters involved in 79 percent of fatal home heating fires.

http://www.nfpa.org/press-room/news-releases/2010/space-heaters-involved-in-79-percent-of-fatal-home-heating-fires 




 It's worth getting a professional opinion instead of risking burning down your house. 




 How could doctors be utilized? The government can regulate doctors but they can't give them money and tell them to give the money to patients who've lost weight.

 




 The government can control what businesses do. They cannot simply offer people money for weight loss -- there's no mechanism for it. 




  You can get out of the rut, if you just... do it.

 This is not a shoe advertisement. The trick, I'm now convinced, is to just go ahead and do it, whether you feel like it or not. Because you know what? YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO FEEL LIKE IT.

 Pick something you've always wished you could do. 

That's great, but I have a friend who's depressed. There is nothing she's always wished she could do. She literally has no interests aside from reading and watching TV. 




 That's a good idea, but they have to be careful: My friend was told by an electrician that the outlet in her bathroom was not strong enough for a space heater.

 I think in Europe they must use the word tower in a different way than we do in a America. That's not a tower, it's a building. The English definition of a tower is a tall structure that's taller than it is wide, usually by a lot. That flak tower is fairly short and squat. 




 A little late to this party but from searching, over in /r/books about four months ago a lot of people expressed this opinion, but more recently if you say you didn't like it you get crucified. 

I agree with everything you said except for the bit about Hugo Lamb. I didn't find any of it compelling. I basically had to force myself to read it, not because the writing was bad or boring per se but because there was literally no character that was of any interest or any storyline that I cared to find out how it was resolved.

The sum of my feelings is that it was a poorly-stitched Franken-novel.

People sometimes think they will react in a certain way, and when the time comes, it somehow isn't how it goes.

This isn't a case of being cornered in a dark alley and feeling panicked.

After years of snapping up credit cards with ease, the Credit CARD Act of 2009 will make it much more difficult for anyone under the age of 21 to qualify for a credit card.

Under the new law, which takes effect in February 2010, no one under the age of 21 will be approved for a credit card offer unless a parent or guardian or spouse is willing to co-sign, or the young adult shows proof of sufficient income to cover the credit obligation.

If it's to show dominance, what's wrong with just beating the crap out of the guy?

Because men are much more terrified of being raped than being beaten.

 At least in academia it is absolutely possible to plagiarize yourself. I haven't seen it mentioned regarding fiction but that's probably because you're not going to sue yourself for plagiarism and neither will your audience.

But either way, like you said, reusing the same themes, characters, etc., is very common. Though if the author reuses them to extent that they run out of anything new to say about them, I consider that literary cannibalism.

 If his depression is specific to his job, you need to sit him down, figure out what the problem with his job is and how he can fix it, even if it means going to his boss or HR and asking for some kind of special accommodations.

 I'm a fan of the Five Love Languages theory. One of the ways of showing love is gift giving. But either you feel uncomfortable about receiving gifts for some reason or it's simply not something that makes you feel loved. 

To a certain extent, this is an intractable problem. If the two of you stay together, one of you has to change. If he does other things that make you feel loved, then I recommend it be you. Otherwise, it should be him because there's no sense in having a boyfriend who you don't feel loves you. 




 Valentine's Day has a historical foundation too. It wasn't "just sort of created" any more than Christmas was. You get Christians saying that Christmas has been become too commodified, so they can try to "take back" Valentine's Day if they want, too.

 Until I got to Reddit I had no idea that people saw images in their head when they read since I never have. Hasn't stopped me from getting wrapped up in books and being able to suspend disbelief when necessary. At the same time, yes, I dislike epic/high fantasy because there's so much description that does nothing for me -- it just drags down the pace of the story. I do like urban and comic fantasy because they tend to dispense with all that wordiness. I also read a variety of other genres.

 This is not correct. The Bible gave signs for which mammals were allowed to be eaten and which weren't. They are: split hooves and chewing their cud. Pigs are singled out for special mention because they have split hooves but don't chew their cud.

That's a name?

 Because they tried Prohibition already and it was a disaster. It could be in the future once marijuana is fully legalized around the world they will start in on demonizing alcohol. 




 They are chemical reactions in our bodies which we interpret as emotions of one sort or another. For example, when you hug somebody and get a release of oxytocin, you interpret it as love. 




 When you fill your mouth with water there is no lack of oxygen. Swishing water around your mouth can help prevent tooth decay by washing away sugars or particles stuck between your teeth, but it can't kill germs. Only mouthwash can do that. 




 Still the same answer, honestly. Obviously it depends on your relationship, but I've had some funny (read: awkward) encounters with non-Orthodox coworkers on the subject of religion and it's left me gun shy.  




 "Happy holiday." 

It's a nice thought for you to be more specific, but I personally find it uncomfortable. Plus, if the person saying "happy holiday" has their own holiday around the same time, I can easily say back "Thanks, you too." 




 I look at tall beautiful blonde people and I think "I'm supposed to look like that." What's the difference between you and me? Otherkin look at animals and think "I'm supposed to look like that." What's the difference between you and them? 




 Funny, I was about to mention the third book in Follett's Century trilogy: Edge of Eternity. I will probably finish it this weekend, but it's such a slog. It's more like a trip through history than an actual story about real characters, like a more boring version of Forrest Gump.  




 Let him read Ivanhoe, then. Outlander is basically the 20th century version of Twilight. 




 "It was as black in the closet as old blood"

The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie by Alan Bradley.

Disappointing book, actually. I expected it to be delightful and it's not. 




 It's meant to be a throwback to the olden days before they were able to produce paper evenly. As sort of mentioned above, it's a stylistic choice, often used for literary fiction to imply that the book is somehow more "authentic." (Though if you Google it, plenty of crap gets deckle edging too. Sometimes it's just a publisher's *thing*.) 




 That's called deckle edge and it's totally normal. When I Googled what you said the title was, that's exactly how they described it. You got the book you ordered.

On the Road Paperback  Deckle Edge, June 1, 1999 




 On the top right-hand side of your phone. 




 He shouldn't be trying any of those things. He doesn't have a sleep disorder.

If this is the first time he's lived with someone, then he just needs time to adjust. It may take a while -- months even -- but a hotel room doesn't compare. Not only because it was probably for a relatively short amount of time, but also because it was not his own room and it was a disruption in his normal life routine, all of which can cause sleeping problems. 




 No need to make life difficult for yourself. Just because a book is considered to have literary merit doesn't mean it can't be short and/or easy to read. I'd go with ~~the Crucible,~~ A Separate Peace, and 1984.

Wait, you said it had to be a novel. Hamlet and Dante's Inferno aren't novels. 




  As for the bed thing, that's pretty easy....two twin beds pushed together lets you "share" a bed but pick the mattress that works best for both of you.

Or the sleep number bed where the two sides can be adjusted separately if the room is too small for two twin beds. 




 Apparently if you don't own a lot of books, they age you down, potentially by 20+ years, and vice versa: if you own a lot of books, they age you up. That question should be deleted, or at least weighted differently since no doubt a good many people, such as myself, get books from the library. Not to mention that owning a lot of books has nothing to do with your "taste" in books. 









 Not only do I do this, I try whatever it is the person is interested in, so I'll have more of a personal experience of what they're talking about. Even if I end up not liking it, at least I gave it a shot. And sometimes I do end up liking it so now we have a shared interest.

I have yet to meet anybody who would do this for me. And that's why I'm still single. 

Well, part of the reason. 




 The idea is that a drunk might be aware that they are drunk and take as much care as they can, be cautious.

Except this doesn't happen. The old saying is that if a person is weaving all over the road, they're drunk; if they're driving extra cautiously, they're stoned.

Distracted driving is not worse than drunk driving, in fact, it's better -- in the sense that you can choose to put down your phone but you cannot stop being drunk by choosing not to be drunk anymore. 




 In my experience, often enough to be noticeable.

For example, at work, I can't tell you how many times I've been sitting at my desk, the phone rings once and then hangs up, and whoever it was never makes any attempt to call or contact me again. So if I'm not at my desk when a call comes in and when I get back there's a "missed call" indication but they haven't left a message or sent me an e-mail, I'm going to assume they dialed my number by accident. 




 Just because someone dialed my number it doesn't necessarily mean they want to talk to me, or it doesn't necessarily mean they want to talk to me later. It could easily be a wrong number* or that they wanted to talk to me right then and there and if I'm not around, never mind, I don't need to call them back later. 

*Yes, even if it's someone you know. For example, I've dialed one friend when I meant to call another.  




 It feels really awkward to call someone for no reason, mostly because I can't stop thinking that the other person has better things to do and wants to get off the phone.

You need to trust that your friends want to talk to you. If they don't, then you might want to reconsider whether they're actually your friends or not.

I have friends that I talk to for two hours every week, I have friends I talk to for an hour a month. I chit-chat with my mother for about five minutes at a time multiple times a week sometimes. It entirely depends on what your schedule is, their schedule is, and what you have to say to each other. 

Lately I've found some of my conversations start awkwardly, like we're both being polite about letting the other person go first. I need to start being more assertive because one of my friends tends to monopolize the conversation if I let her go first.

The conversations end when it's time to go to bed or it's time to go do something such as putting the kids to bed or taking the cake out of the oven or switching over the laundry from the washing machine to the dryer. 




  I feel like I'm unable to multitask while holding a phone to my ear.

1. Don't multitask. If you're sitting in a restaurant with your friend you might both be eating, but you're not doing the laundry or walking the dog or sending out resumes. There's no reason why you should be multitasking just because you're sitting at home.

2. If you simply must multitask, get some kind of hands-free device or put the call on speakerphone. 




 Plus, only wear cotton underwear. 




 Not really correct. There were some well-known rich Jewish families and there were certainly some well-off Jewish communities, but overall, the majority of Jews throughout history were poor. 

This kind of conspiracy theory that OP is talking about really only goes back to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, which was first published in 1903. Previous to that, the sort of conspiracy theories about Jews was that they were poisoning wells and using the blood of Christian children in their matzah, not that they were taking over the world.  




 The US-Mexico border isn't linear. A good chunk of it is the Rio Grande. Most US state borders aren't linear either. I only count ten states whose borders are precisely straight or nearly so. Even the US-Canada border is only straight for part of the way. 




 I'm not sure you could draw any better conclusions than we already do from studies and death certifications/autopsies. Without extensive information about a person's background and lifestyle, you couldn't control for confounding factors.  




 Baccano was better.  




 Where do you live, OP? Are owls common around there? 




 I haven't seen the movie yet but as I watched the trailer for Far From Men (with Viggo Mortensen), it felt like they literally gave away the entire movie.  









 "Take a Walk" by Passion Pit is sort of about that.  




 Theoretically I have no problem with people carrying guns but in reality I find that many people who want to carry them are more paranoid about their safety than reality warrants and they're looking to be heroes, which too often leads to unsafe practices such as not keeping their guns properly secured when children are around or by shooting first and asking questions later. 




 Most likely the state's health department, possibly also the CDC. 

But while it's an interesting idea, I'm not entirely sure that looking at people's medical records would really tell us much since they're not controlled studies. 




 Most likely they're very dry. Blinking a few times and creating tears should clear it up, if not, then artificial tears/saline should do the trick. 




 Stories aren't just intellectually engaging, they're also emotionally engaging. You care about a story you're reading. By and large you couldn't care less about the history you're studying.  




  Symptoms of food poisoning generally don't happen overnight

Generally they do. Some don't, but the most commons ones do. In fact, many of them show symptoms after only a few hours. 




 Never do this. Someone who isn't identifiable as Jewish is the same as a non-Jew, in terms of practical matters. 

For example, if I were in a theme park and I needed directions to the bathroom, it doesn't matter the religion of the person I ask; if I needed directions to the kosher food stand, then someone who isn't identifiably Jewish probably won't know. 




 This is only true for male versus female life expectancy and nothing really to do with any particular person. 

As has been said, men are more likely to have risky jobs. They are also more likely to engage in risky behavior and less likely to take care of their health, such as by going to the doctor when they have symptoms of a serious illness.  




 They most certainly will not tell you that. This only happens in the movies. The only time that staying conscious matters is if the person potentially has a concussion. 




 Cannot confirm. I live in NYC, work with plumbers, have gotten more gas calls in the past three days than in past three months. 




 And I feel like I've been an adult ever since I can remember and only now that I'm bordering middle age do I finally feel like I'm the right age.

At the same time, I like to pick up pennies, sing silly songs, watch cartoons, and go on Reddit. 

So, get off my lawn, OP! 




 Fear. Even if you that person isn't "the one," at least you have someone. If you leave them, you're afraid that you might not meet anyone ever again.  




 Murder is an infinite crime.  




 It's not legit in the sense that the DEAC is not considered an accrediting body for the purposes of claiming that a school is "accredited." 

If you're outside the US the UoP might be worth more because they say you can transfer the credits to NYU Abu Dhabi.  




 I never heard of it so I Googled. It's not accredited, so it's not entirely legit.  




 I speak French. It says: Do you want fries with that?

Strange sign to put on wires, but hey, that's the French for you, always promoting their own cuisine. 




 You're hanging out in the wrong threads? I see it all the time.

Though occasionally I do get the feeling that some Redditors are not used to defending their opinions and they back off awfully quickly when challenged, which can be boring.  




 Not quite.

Whether a particular type of bird flies south for the winter depends mainly on one thing: what type of food it eats.

In areas that have cold winters, some common bird foods, such as nectar and insects, may not be available year-round. Birds that eat those foods must fly south to find food to survive. Other birds that eat seeds or bugs that live under tree bark often hang around, since they can continue to find food all winter long.

 If they weren't Orthodox Jews/followers of the Shabbos, this tragedy would not have occurred.

This is false. 

Hot plates are commonly used items. 

They are safe to use.

They are not safe to misuse.

It is not a religious requirement to misuse a hot plate.

The tragedy occurred because of their misuse of the hot plate.

Of course I know what you're trying to say, and you're mistaken. The only way you'd be correct is if hot plates were inherently unsafe and Orthodox Jews insisted on using them anyway. This is clearly not the case. 




 No, we don't agree at all. If using a hot plate were unsafe then they wouldn't sell them.  




 I reread your post and I just want to make sure we are on the same page: you understand they left the hot plate on on purpose right? In order to avoid using electricity/flicking a switch on their religious holiday.

Which was completely unnecessary. In other words: not a religious requirement. Most people use timers to turn them on and off automatically. There's a guy in this thread who copped to leaving his hot plate on all Sabbath. You can ask him why he thinks it's safe despite the fact that we have proof that it isn't. And if he says "because their hot plate was malfunctioning and mine isn't," then he's clearly just as thoughtless as these people. Nobody knowingly uses a malfunctioning hot plate. In fact, I'm not sure there's anything he could say that wouldn't prove that he's being thoughtless.

Sorry for the idiot comment, it was out of line. it's just such a frustrating situation my emotions got the best of me.

Thanks. 




 As I said earlier in the thread, anybody who does that is doing so out of carelessness, not religion. There is absolutely no religious reason why they shouldn't use a timer so that it's only on when people are home and awake. 




 It doesn't have to be complex, it has to be compelling.  




 What religion do you blame when someone burns down their house when they used a flamethrower to try to kill a spider? When they fell asleep with a lit cigarette? When they used a stove to heat a cold apartment? You're the idiot if you think that religion is a more important factor here than carelessness. Orthodox Jews are not the only people in the world who use hot plates and are not the only ones who have fires caused by them. 




 This has nothing to do with "hardline Jewish Orthodoxy" and everything to do with thoughtlessness. Every time a person uses electricity or flames they should take utmost care -- and too many people don't. But most people get away with it.  




 Sadly, not everybody I know lives in NYC.  




 We will always enter and search to be sure that nobody was home, putting us at risk with their stupid decisions.

And I didn't know that. Will mention it next time the subject comes up.

Meanwhile it's not uncommon for bad fires to spread to neighboring houses

Not everybody lives in such close proximity to others so this isn't always applicable. 




 BDE.

Please do not leave your hot plate on all Shabbos, and do not leave it alone unattended, especially if you live in a house/building with multiple apartments or a single-family house that is in close proximity to other buildings/houses. 




 Nobody I know leaves a hot plate on the entire Sabbath. They use timers to turn them on and off. That said, I have told friends not to leave the house unattended if a hot plate is on. They ignored me, believing that these things only happen to other people. But I suppose the upside is that if the house burns down, at least there isn't anybody in it.  




 Friendship is the basis for a great many women's novels but obviously that's not what the author of this article cares about. And if he's looking for something more literary, there was last year's Friendship by Emily Gould. 




 The "things that don't need to be kosher for Pesach in the first place" is my favorite part. (Page 102) 




 Half a dozen, if not twice that. I couldn't put an exact number on it.  




 I hate that nobody seems to know what's going on. There doesn't seem to be any training regarding the library's features. Interlibrary loan? Only one person knows about it and she's not here right now. The fact that it says my digital loan hold is going to expire tomorrow despite the fact that I only placed it today? Can't explain it.

I also hate that shelf reading isn't done regularly and books that the catalogue says are there aren't really there. 




 I was considering visiting Denver this year (it didn't work out) but the first thing I did to plan for the trip was Google kosher food. Maybe I'll get there next year. 




 but they fucked up on checking in my books three times in a row.

How? My library has a book slot but after they managed to lose one of the books I tossed in there, I stopped using it. And after they once didn't acknowledge the fact that I paid a fine on a late item, I always made sure to get a receipt for proof. So one time something going wrong I can see, but three times? 




 What about this place?

 Library all the way. You have absolutely no need to feel guilty about getting books for free (by which I mean, paid for by your tax dollars).

 Not whispering, but they recently did a study where they paired cigarettes with a bad smell while people were sleeping and it did help them cut back on smoking, while pairing a bad smell with smoking while people were awake had no impact.

 Yes, you're right I ignored some parts of your post and I don't find your saying so abrasive, it's just that I'm caught up with this same thing with someone who's in the place of your coworker and it's so hard to have to basically just stand around and watch them suffer because of a bad decision they made 20 years ago and have been compounding ever since. 




 I don't know what your circumstances are or what your goals are, but your coworker is 100% correct that it's easier to go back to school when you're younger than when you're older, and if you wait to until you "know what you want to do," you might be waiting until you're dead because not everybody figures out what they want. Besides, going to college can help you figure out what you want because there's a variety of classes you wouldn't have an opportunity to take otherwise and professors and advisers that you wouldn't be able to interact with otherwise. 









 Unless you are talking about a specific person, how can you possibly give a more specific answer?  




 Not all US states have Powerball, so I'm genuinely surprised that Puerto Rico does (and apparently so do the US Virgin Islands!). That said, those idiots on Twitter are just that: Ignorant idiots. 

In the olden days idiots didn't have a worldwide platform to air their nonsense so the only people who knew they existed were their friends and relatives. Now that they can tweet to everyone, and reporters seem to think that looking on Twitter constitutes "news gathering," you're hearing these idiots' voices more and more. 




 Where have you ever seen predictions a month in advance? Most sites give 10 days out. The monthly "forecasts" are just averages for those dates. 




 Either they're lazy, they're jerks, they didn't grow up with these habits so they're not accustomed to them, or they're genuinely forgetful. 




 The grey and white one in the middle third from the front. 




 But they have to make a point not to keep it fully.  









 It's forbidden for non-Jews to keep Shabbos. It doesn't matter how sincere they are about it, it's not allowed and presumably they would be punished for it.  




 Let's see. She has no sense of humor. She's some kind of sexist/homophobe. She doesn't know how to have an adult conversation. She tries to make you think that you're doing something wrong by being yourself.

 I guess you missed the two sentences before the one you quoted.

They found the widest gap in entitlement, suggesting that men are more likely than women to exploit others and feel entitled to certain privileges.

 While what was already said is probably correct, a lot of people who appear to bruise more easily are actually just more clumsy -- they're bumping into things more and don't even realize it.  




 So either he's a Gary Stu or he's an exaggerating bragger with no sense of perspective. Not seeing that one is better than the other.
