 I've been on the medication about a month.  I mean, I wasn't expecting happy daisies and roses and unicorns out my butt soon after taking it, but I can't tell if the way I feel is because the medicine isn't the right medicine, or if it really is everything else. :/  Definitely a really awkward place to be.  Especially because if I break up with my boyfriend, he'd have to move back in with his parents across the country (U.S.) and that would be it for us.  No real chance of reconciliation.  




 Hi everybody.  I've been a lurker on reddit for a little while, but I need somebody, anybody to talk to.  
I was diagnosed with depression about a month ago, and was put on Wellbutrin.  That's all fine, but I feel like nothing will change unless I change what is going on in my life, but I feel like I can't.
I'm currently in my 2nd year of a 2 year Master's program, and honestly?  I don't want the degree. I have realized that science research is not my thing, at all.  I don't even slightly enjoy it.  The only thing I enjoy about it is that i can be a TA. However, I am in debt a little bit from it.  Everyone tells me "the hard part is over!  You only have a few more months!"  but those months include smashing out a long thesis over a subject I absolutely do not enjoy.  I don't enjoy any of the program at all.  It is not what I want to do.  I'm not sure what career path is for me, but this is not it. 
Also, I live with my boyfriend of 2.5 years.  And... I've been considering breaking up with him.  A lot.  I just don't feel the same way about him, plus I don't want to be tied down to the same person since I was 21 (I'm 24).  It's hard to describe, but it hurts.  I've voiced it to him, but we live 3000 miles from any family, so we're stuck in this position. 
So, I'm not sure what to do.  Or if anybody has ever had anything like this feeling before.  That you are stuck in the life you are in, and there's nothing you can do to change it.  To top it off, I'm not sure if the depression is causing all these feelings about school/boyfriend, or if the school/boyfriend is causing the depression.  I just don't know. 
If anybody has any advice, I would really appreciate it.  I am new to depression, and very scared. 

TL;DR--have depression, hate current life and feel stuck, I feel like I can't escape without causing big problems. 
























 Oops, didn't reply to the second part of your question.  The course thing--been feeling this way since about...April-ish?  And the boyfriend thing--about late June-ish, about 2 months after we moved in together. 




 Thank you :)  It is nice to talk to positive people.  I'm usually a fairly outgoing positive person, but the last few months have definitely taken a toll on me.  
























 :)  Thanks.  A current mini marathon of How I Met Your Mother is also helping me out.  I just wish I had a time machine to halt everything and think things through!  That, or enough money to drop everything and travel down under, where I've always wanted to 




 I get that.  This time last year when I was drowning in coursework, etc, I never really hated it or felt like leaving it forever.  
It's hard that most of my friends in the program are not only going to medical school (many have already been accepted, ridiculous) but are *supposedly* just loving their projects and feel like they are in the right place.  I am definitely the outcast of the group.
But thank you :)  Any advice from anyone is truly appreciated. 
























 I'm glad a total internet stranger seems so confident in my abilities! :)  I will say, depression has a way of making you feel like you are the worst person on earth (by "you" i mean like a general "you"...not you yourself... ha). Topped with the insecurities I already had... it is not a pretty sigh over here.  




 Makes me feel better to hear that from someone.  The doctor was like "You should feel great in a week!"...Uhhh...I do not. Not even close! 
























 Hmmm, link?  I tried a small Google search and the top like 3 pages were about "de boss rooster"... 




 Haha, I have no idea if the "man" in that was thinking I am male, but I am not.  But I say "dude" all the time anyways, no matter who it is!  But never "bro"... never, ever "bro"...
I think the thing that kills me the most is that I did this all to myself.  And I'm sitting here crying about my life when people affected by Sandy have no homes, etc.   
























 Good point!  I guess I did feel a little better admitting to someone that something was wrong.  As hard as that was, I am extremely stubborn, but I still hit my breaking point.  




 Hahahahahahaha... and not the "haha" that people type without laughing, no I literally laughed out loud at that.  I'm not sure why, maybe because I took French for many years, and don't remember a thing. 
























 I took six years of French... but 6 years ago.  My mom is even fluent, but I don't remember a lick of it. 




 That was a very nice poem.  I'm saving it for future reference for myself to look at later :)
