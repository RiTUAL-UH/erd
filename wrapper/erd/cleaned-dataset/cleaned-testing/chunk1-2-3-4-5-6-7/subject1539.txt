 Got a ship from Stephen last year, clapped out near Uranus and I'd to hitch a comet the whole way home. Frozen, I was. 




 I'm against it as the consequences of failure could lead to the irradiation of an entire province. Plus our electricity demands don't require a nuclear power station.

To look at Germany, Spain   Portugal achieve 40% upwards of their needs via renewables last year - it would seem irrational of us to go with nuclear.

Then the cost of the radioactive waste disposal is a bill our childrens' Ireland have to pick up, and most countries with the capacity will not accept another country's waste. IIRC there are ships with nuclear waste which simply circle the globe while governments fight over who is going to take it.

I think nuclear is a solution to a problem we don't have, and there are better solutions available. Finally, when a country with the engineering expertise and reputation such as Germany reckons they can do without - why would we join the nuclear party when everyone else is leaving for very good reasons. 




 Cheers for the tip Eamon!

I've no interest in this government or any other one privatising domestic water provision by stealth. And it's unlikely this can be anything else, plus I really don't appreciate having to pay for the metering such companies will have to rely on. In fairness, Phil Hogan is in charge of it - and we all saw the suspicious fiasco he caused with Greyhound.

On a more general note, I'll do my upmost to make sure that any issues that effect the whole country will be "trawled in the media" at every opportunity I get.

Of course, in case anyone has forgotten here's a [little link](http://www.broadsheet.ie/2011/06/01/say-it-aint-so-eamo/) to just how two-faced that travesty of a TD truly is. 









 The closest I know of would be this image:

http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=62 t=2713

and there's a few more community images here:

http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=77 t=3410 

The U2 / U3 images are interchangable 99% of the time, so don't let that put you off.

The user who creates the majority of these images 'robroy' is fantastic, so asking in the forums would be the best thing.

The first image should fit the bill. I'd certainly start with the images from the forums, rather than creating your own isos, as they work 'out of the box' and take away most of the fiddling around for drivers etc.  




 I absolutely love them. Versatile and small, I'm setting one up for a friend who wants a pc on their TV and I'll be able to velcro the odroid to the back of the tv for extra tidiness.

Here's a quick comparison [photo](http://i.imgur.com/hQ7KFAx.jpg), U2 on the left and the U3 on top of the Pi. I'm not sure they sell the U2 anymore.

If you do go for one, I'd also get an 8gb eMMC card rather than boot from an SD card - the eMMC are really fast. 

Though it's very handy for testing to use SDs and a lot of people have SDs sitting around unused. 




 I use an Odroid U2 as a home server, NAS, book server, torrenting machine, motion server and all of that barely stresses it.

They've upgraded it now to the [U3](http://hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php) (an extra USB port, slimmer profile). It's $59 before shipping and is even slightly smaller than the Pi :)

There's loads of tips and projects on the [forums](http://forum.odroid.com/) too. I use one as my main desktop too as they're fanless and silent.

Just to add, I still use my Pi for XBMC as its gpu is better at 1080p than the Odroid's, though not by much.

 It's something I've had experience with recently, horizontal lines on the nail mean a trip to a doctor would be worthwhile and possibly overdue.

If they're not on the other nail then I reckon it's the bullet and not such a big deal.

Seeing the youthfulness of the skin I wouldn't expect to see either horizontal or vertical lines on the nails, verticals will happen to most (eventually) - horizontals are worth a check-up. 









 Wow, that looks painful, ghastly   eventually relieving! Your pain threshold must be impressive at this stage.

Hope you don't mind the question but the horizontal striations on your big-toenail, are they on the other big toe too?

 




 It's the Last of Us for me.

I enjoyed Bioshock: Infinite, its weaker parts are better than many other games' good parts - but I think the game doesn't work as a complete experience in the way TLoU does.

B:I has nowhere near as much tension, and so doesn't pull you in or make you care to succeed / survive to the extent TLoU does.

Often during B:I I felt like I was wondering around a deserted museum. A museum filled with glimpses of the game that could have been, and I suspect a game that was diminished so it could be coded for current-gen consoles (e.g. the difference between the final game and the initial [years old trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajCiS0_ssLE) which still to me has more tension than the acutal game).

I felt I played all the game that Naughty Dog wanted to make and I would have played hours more of it.

I was glad to reach the end of B:I and kinda finished it just to see the end for myself - I was ready to finish the game hours earlier.


 









 I let Steve Ballmer weigh in on that one:

["We released fantastic games, and, **most importantly**, we expanded Xbox to go beyond great gaming to deliver all the entertainment people want  sports, music, movies, live television and much more."](http://kotaku.com/the-new-xbox-boss-is-steve-ballmer-638364468?utm_campaign=Socialflow_Kotaku_Twitter utm_source=Kotaku_Twitter utm_medium=Socialflow) 




 We released fantastic games, and, most importantly, we expanded Xbox to go beyond great gaming to deliver all the entertainment people want  sports, music, movies, live television and much more.

So, maybe the multimedia focus wasn't all Don Mattrick's idea? I guess it had to be signed-off further up the hierarchy. 









 Do you think the XB1 has more compute units in the GPU? Wouldn't MS have mentioned that by now? I guess they can't seeing that it was an MS engineer that let slip the info that the XB1 has less.

As for the 'current leaks', that refers to the GPU clock speed. I'm sure if it was a differentiator between the consoles, the console with the higher speed would have announced it already.

If there was an XB1 tech-spec sheet with the same level of detail as the PS4 then we could all settle the differences between the two, when are MS going to reveal more details I wonder. What's the delay?
 
 




 See for yourself: 

http://www.anandtech.com/show/6972/xbox-one-hardware-compared-to-playstation-4/2

On the graphics side its once again obvious that Microsoft and Sony are shopping at the same store as the Xbox Ones SoC integrates an AMD GCN based GPU. Heres where things start to get a bit controversial. Sony opted for an 18 Compute Unit GCN configuration, totaling 1152 shader processors/cores/ALUs. Microsoft went for a far smaller configuration: 768 (12 CUs).

Microsoft cant make up the difference in clock speed alone (AMDs GCN seems to top out around 1GHz on 28nm), and based on current leaks it looks like both MS and Sony are running their GPUs at the same 800MHz clock. The result is a 33% reduction in compute power, from 1.84 TFLOPs in the PS4 to 1.23 TFLOPs in the Xbox One.  




 So why not provide some links that contradict what is a well referenced post? 




 Oh I reckon they'll keep the eSRAM for games whenever possible - TV / Skyping etc. wouldn't require the time-critical benefits of it. If MS are aiming for 1080p games running at 30 or 60 fps - they'll want all the juice they can give it.

I'm sure it could be put to use when games aren't running. Though with the consoles expected to be on shelves in 5 months, these drip-feeds of info better not be what developers are also getting. 




 I reckon it's a blisteringly fast pipeline of sorts, as it's on the same chip and all.

To be honest, I think the article creates as many questions as it answers.

A detailed one-sheet spec from MS themselves would be handy at this stage, the speculation won't go away until there are some solid numbers.

I won't be getting either console until they've been 'out in the wild' for a while anyway. Though if details don't come soon - I'm betting that MS could end up with a warehouse full of lemons by January. Word spreads a lot faster than it did 7 years ago. 




 What's been said now suggests that the eSRAM is even better than MS thought but the details about speed   bandwidth (skimpy as they are) don't form a solid picture.

Either one hardware part has been slowed-down on purpose to achieve read   writes at the same time or one of the numbers is plain wrong. 

The story is incomplete - be that on the journalist's side or from the story's source. 




 The PS4 hardware has clear advantages.

The XB1's response to these apparent advantages is its eSRAM - if this works as planned it should balance out, some to most of, the hardware differences.

There is only 32MB of the eSRAM available. So it has to used for something important, and also something that isn't (in data terms) very big. Probably data that needs to be quickly delivered and then replaced with an updated version and delivered again. Software will have to be written with that in mind.

If the eSRAM can't be used like this or if it's too tricky to make it useful that way - then devs might avoid it and the processing of the game will suffer. PS4 games would look better and cost less to get looking that way. 




 Yeah, they dropped the number of shares from [5 to 3](http://uk.gamespot.com/news/sony-getting-stricter-on-ps3-and-psp-game-sharing-6344077) but it's still going.

 It's not that the TV part won't allow me, but that the licensing agreements across Europe are so problematic that there isn't even a standard Netflix catalog.

As for sports, I don't think there's any hope Microsoft can provide on that while even fully licensed national stations can't agree with each other pan-europa.

Plus each nation has its list of national free-to-air sports events that must be shown free-of-charge. Disallowing Microsoft from showing them to Xbox Live only subscribers - not a business incentive for them. 




 Oh, I know there's no solid info - yet when Kinect came out initially there were similar claims to have 'not-abandoned-the-core-gamers'. That didn't pan out and neither did a ground-swell of Kinect fans.

Microsoft will be in a great position if/when they've 8 new games to tout at E3 for the X1 but they don't have a previous delivery on promises to back it up.

Sony have presented many PS4 exclusives already, and they haven't shown the machine yet.

It's all very crazy, but either PR companies are toying with them both for shits/giggles/profits, or one of them will have some pointless advertising bills to pay.

I'm in Europe so the TV part of the X1 won't sell it to me - there needs to be very compelling games; the spy-in-the-cab isn't helping either. 




 So certainty   comfort all round, that's nice.

I guess hedge-funds won't be using Microsoft this Christmas. 




 True, but I don't think Microsoft used this as a springboard to E3 - now they really have to bring the fireworks.

Yesterday's announcement should have encouraged many more enthused people for their E3. I think it's creating the opposite. 




 If they had gameplay to show, they'd have presented it - an arbitrary wait wouldn't be mandatory (unlike the mandatory infrared Kinect camera   microphones)

 That'd be shocking really though, there's no work in the construction sector generally but there's loads to be done in this country. Money is becoming less of an object (at the government level, our bonds are doing well).

 Yeah, doesn't inspire confidence that the diary is filled out after the fact. I'm sure other ministers can confirm whether that's a regular occurrence.

Plus, we don't need this speculation at all. We can just ask 'Alan Shatter   Officials' when the meeting was held and check their diaries.

I'm sure the Taoiseach doesn't drive around on his own either, so wouldn't the driver service have a record of where he was that day and when they drove him there?

 




 Yeap same day as Sinn Fin are asking about.

I'd be inclined to go with the harmless interpretation that "I wasn't in Dublin until around 4", grand, the meeting in the Shelbourne was at 4.30; plus "Sunday morning meetings are rare, but I wasn't in Dublin at all." [at that time, but I was in Dublin later].

However, considering the early morning Shatter meeting was in the diary for the 23rd and is about the Garda business - it's all seeming a little suspect. Alan Shatter had no intention of resigning back in March. Plus the idea that the diary is filled out retrospectively is bad practice or just smoke-screen.

I'm for water charges in principle   practice, but as a conservation and infrastructure maintenance measure. Not this cludge from a government that still hasn't told us the cost per litre. Do they not know or are they not saying? Well, it's election time so I'm guessing it's both.

Putting in meters rather than fixing the leaks first, tells me this is more the prelude to privatisation than an environment resource measure. No commodity suits the needs of hedge funds better than water - people will always need it. And the push for privatisation has been going on for some time.

 Smithers, Release the Cows! 




 It absolutely would. But what are the chances that the other 2 taxes we pay for water will remain in place?

This is a cash-grab, not a conservation measure.

Irish Water are spending our money on meters now, not fixing leaks which would be the ultimate conservation measure. 




 We are already pay for water via taxes (twice). The new water charge is not going to be spent on water infrastructure for some time. It's to pay off county council debts. That's the reality there.

There are many other deserving sources of revenue generation that could be tapped, rather than another charge on our tapped-out citizenry.

Anyway, it's such a non-story there are four links about it above. Plus no-one's being charged for water yet, many things could change, though we'd have to be non-defeatist about it.

 Don't let [Superintendent Foxtrot](https://imgur.com/Sc8af2c) have anything to do with your life (page 306).

And from [RT](http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/0509/616164-guerin-report/):

The report concluded that Mr Shatter did not heed the voice of Sgt McCabe despite the high esteem in which he was held.

Mr Guerin said that was despite the minister having specific statutory powers in the area of complaints from members.

Mr Guerin said there was a "near total absence" in the papers he had examined of written records of submissions made, or advice given, to the minister by his officials.

He said he had seen no written internal records of decisions made by the minister.

Guerin said the approach adopted "had the result that there was no independent investigation" of Sgt McCabe's complaints.

He concluded that the absence of written records was a "matter of some concern", saying it appeared that the minister had acted "on foot of advice received by the commissioner", without that advice being questioned or analysed.

That is atrocious, Shatter looks like he completely sided with whatever Callinan wanted.

 I'd be happy to overtake the UK, Japan's education system though creates a fair few zombies (I taught an 11 year old over there with grey hair) so let's not aim too high. 




 Here's another one, though I've no idea about the paper mentioned - maybe someone here knows it:

http://ronancasey.ie/2014/05/woman-tears-up-election-leaflet-fined-e150/  




 You can use [ES file manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop) to connect to the Pi and thus it's harddrive and download them to the tablet that way.

Though if it's simply to watch movies on the tablet while within range of your home network you are much better off streaming the movies to your tablet. Use either the tablet's built-in video player, many come with network streaming now, or use something like [YAACC](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=yaacc fdid=de.yaacc) to provide the bridging-link between the Pi, your tablet and its video app. 









 I see he's going to give Defence to a [current minister](http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/fitzgerald-confirmed-as-new-justice-minister-629934.html), wonder who that'll be. 




 Which I can totally see, what I can't see is how the volume of water used by 13 million people is ultimately cheaper than the volume of water used by 4.5.

Together with the Tube, the awkwardness of city infrastructure in general - I imagine digging up for repairs is more costly in London also. 




 I know one person in that situation, it's an old row of houses in a small town - so I reckon it could be very common.

And then there's my brother's house where nobody knows where to put his meter. He even called the original builder (in his 70s now) and he'd no clue where it met up with the town supply either.

Three different people called my brother about it from the contracting company without knowing about the other calls, so you can imagine phonecall #3 was shorter and louder than 2 previous. 




 The situation I mean is where the branching points from the main pipe to all the other houses (after house A) are under house A or otherwise inaccessible. 

Making house A the only one that can be metered, or the piping has to be redone from scratch for all the houses. 




 According to the Irish Times we'll be [paying 0.2 cents per litre](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/bath-set-to-cost-16-cent-while-a-shower-will-set-you-back-25-cent-1.1787308).

So 0.2 cents per litre = 200 cents per 1000 litres or

2 per 1000 litres.

So we'll be more expensive than London, a city with a greater population than our whole country.

Wouldn't it be great if Phil Hogan or Irish Water actually told us the charge? 









 One thing I haven't seen resolved are the cases where a row of houses share the one pipe - making it impossible to individually meter each house's usage.

What happens if the house that can be metered (or simply one of the houses) refuses to pay the bill - do all the houses have their pressure reduced to a trickle? 









 I can really see a motive for Microsoft in this,  they are facing a future where windows becomes a legacy OS. With only a few copies of windows required inside a VM even within an enterprise context.

 Much apologies, I may have my wires crossed on this one!

Looking at both, I'm having a hard time deciding which species I [have](https://imgur.com/U0ca2sU).

Either way, I only know one other person who's training them as bonsai. Cheers for the other plant name!
 









 Ah, not where I'm from (Ireland), every mention of a Money Tree is a crassula. 




 Seconding the money tree [(Jade Tree)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_plant), will tolerate a fair amount of neglect and can look very bonsai after a year or two.

I recommend they should be grown in a regular sized house-plant pot for a year (or two) until the roots have developed. Then placed into a shallower bonsai pot.

Ficus drove me bananas, I swear they have a passive aggressive nitrogen deficiency thing going on. 




 I reckon that's a completely accurate way of looking at this blast from the past.

Here's another, Eamonn Gilmore will say anything while not in power to get votes - he's just a politician after all and not exceptional in this regard or example.

Yet this can tell us 2 things:

* Eamonn hitched his ride to the Workers Party on principles of a fair society / water provision that he no longer adheres to.

* He has yet again (his Lisbon treaty flip-flop) kowtowed to an EU directive over and above the directive's intent (reasonable decision making reforms / water conservation) and decided it's more about cash for institutional fuck-ups. Or at least, let his 'betters' instruct him so.

In any election there are 'turkeys voting for christmas' - e.g. the ~17% who voted FF in the last election - but Eamonn's turkeys and christmas are movable feasts. He doesn't have to worry though, his policy choices do not have to read as any egregious compromise for the country. He'll simply blame the majority partner with a 'what would it have been like without us' reasoning. He may be expecting the limited communication abilities of 80s here, as his stance won't wash in our internet era. 

I've heard plenty of secondary school students get riled up about this blithe indifference to the net, netizens and it's technorati. As if the net's only an exaggeration-engine and not also the 'printing-press' with a power Irish newspapers envy.

His eyes are on his life after politics. I think his leadership will retire what 'Labour' is left of the Labour party, and his party seems fairly fine about it.

That Ireland's electorate vote via reflex, in pluralities, is a daily awful reminder that the Dil is us. We have done this to ourselves to a very large part.

That is no excuse for the failure of its cheerleaders, such as Gilmore though. 




 I don't reckon he's a puppet-master either.

A combination of minence grise and experienced solicitor should be enough to cow a taoiseach who is unable to debate his own policies in public.

I'd certainly claim Enda is a puppet.

 Jaysus, Billy Hawkes finally grew a pair!?

It'll probably be like the time he found one of Facebook's privacy invasive practices "completely unacceptable" and then let them carry on with it for 6 months (enough time to rehouse the activity outside the EU).

This will be overturned on appeal, then Alan can brush the shit off his shirt to let it drop on Billy. It's not like 2 people have lost their jobs after tangling with him, or anything.

 In fairness, all of those points are **their job** - for which they are paid more than adequately.

Have we reached a point where we expect so little from the Dil that TDs turning up and doing what they're elected to do is laudable?

Here are some other achievements:

* Held a referendum on a stability fund that we can't access a year and a half before we would have needed it anyway. Losing a negotiating position in the process.
* Asserted the need for a pay-cap in public positions, which is then flouted by the Taniste.
* Let the Minister for Justice mislead the Dil after he revealed a TD's penalty point situation live on national TV. None of which jeopardises his job.
* Failed to address the shortcomings of the Data Protection Commissioner which has now lead to the drafting of new EU laws, one of which is specifically designed to avoid the need for EU citizens to go through that Irish office to make complaints.
* Allowing a debt defaulter to be in charge of the country's biggest budget which, surprise surprise, he can't balance.
* Failed to address the egregious loopholes exploited by foreign multinationals which sees a certain company pay 0.14% in tax, instead of 12.5%. Meanwhile Irish companies the absolutely vast employers of people in Ireland see new levies, taxes   rates while remaining on 12.5%. Corporate welfare at its finest.
* Introduced a Property tax   soon a Water charge which makes a mockery of maintaining basic social welfare rates and rates of income tax.
* Increased school classroom numbers which are now the highest in Europe.
* Fails to acknowledge that much of recovery in this country would not have been possible without the ~400,000 people who have left Ireland over the past 5 years for work.

 As a result there are mounting calls for junior ministers [...] Sean Sherlock to be promoted to Cabinet

 Another snippet from the Navan count:

Labour is not singing in a chorus on the leadership elephant in the room. 
A Labour councillor who has lost his seat on Kells town council in Meath has said that Eamon Gilmore should go as the leader of the party if he has any respect for the membership and the people on the ground. Having served on the town council for ten years, Brian Collins was eliminated this morning at the Navan count centre having polled just 395 first preference votes. He said: Im gutted for myself but its been humiliating nationally."

 From RT 11.32

Pat Rabbite has said he thinks Eamon Gilmore should continue as leader of the Labour party. He said he did not know if there will be a leadership challenge and said he was not aware of any moves against him.

They'll be in even more trouble as a party if they don't let him go surely.

 [Jared Diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse:_How_Societies_Choose_to_Fail_or_Succeed) was fairly worried about Australia's prospects nearly 10 years ago but I doubt he expected Tony Abbott:

The perilous state of the Australian environment gives Diamond reason to suspect that Australia may be the first developed state to collapse under environmental pressures. This may initially seem absurd to many Australian readers, but Diamond demonstrates convincingly that societies typically collapse when at the height of their dynamism and affluence, because that is precisely when resource demand is greatest."](http://www.theage.com.au/news/Reviews/Collapse/2005/02/23/1109046981193.html)

 I'm not well versed in what really went on up in Northern Ireland, apart from what the media reports. It wouldn't surprise me if there was blood to spare for all the hands involved.

But I thought the whole point of the peace process was: to stop any more violence, and any more recrimination.

I think that first part has more or less happened - so I'm going to accept the second to ensure the first; as wrong as that may be - it's better than more bloodshed.

I'm not looking past the past, I'm trying to look at a calmer future. 




 If you really can't vote for anyone, still go, but spoil your vote - you can even write a little reason why on the ballot and it will get read.

 Well, they did insist on voting No to the Lisbon treaty the first time round till we got a better deal out of it - that happened.

And when Brian Cowen's FF refused to hold a by-election for 17 months (instead of within the normal 6) - it was Sinn Fin that went to the courts to get it sorted.

I remember that, it informs my vote - as well as my opinion of the parties that didn't contribute to a resolution. 




 I suppose one way of doing it is seeing who you don't want to vote for.
Work out why you won't vote for them - then see is there's a candidate closer to your ideas.

 For security cameras I went with an [Odroid U3](http://hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php) - affordable and more than enough capacity as a home server, security cam, ftp and all the usual goodies. I have 3 cameras feeding into the Odroid and use 'motion' to sense   ftp the images. This barely stresses the Odroid.

They're fanless, quad-core 2gb-ram little beasties with no more of a learning curve than a Pi. Also, they're a tiny bit smaller than a Pi.

I keep the Pi for XBMC   hobby projects. The GPU hardware drivers on the Pi makes them slightly better at XBMC than an Odroid.

But for server, desktop-computer   game-emulator purposes the Odroid is very hard to beat at the price. Plus, the [forums](http://forum.odroid.com/viewforum.php?f=75 sid=10ba83ada948d9cf878eaeaa83530e9d) are great. Do go for an eMMC card if you buy one, much faster than the SD card option. 




 I guess they reckon everyone who had it will double-dip if it comes to PS4.

 My guess is Monday will lead to a few more. Though the voting for who is on it will just start again, and then there will be a new government majority. 

If it was just going to be a chance to tarnish FF with the details, you'd imagine Enda wouldn't be too bothered about the panel's make-up. So I'm guessing there are a few shameful deeds from the current government that need to brushed under the carpet.

He's like a school-teacher who has been given the troublesome students, and now doesn't want anyone to know they've gotten worse under his watch. 




 Good read

Mr Donnelly warned that Taoiseach Enda Kenny can now set the inquiry's terms of reference, decide who is questioned, exclude certain events from consideration and **even veto the final report.**

I wish someone would find definitive evidence that Enda was in league with Alan Shatter over Garda cover-ups, then we could have a GE sooner rather than later.

Do we have to wait for a full omni-shambles, like Cowen's government, before we get there?  




 Well shit Tony, you probably shouldn't have hitched your political legacy to [establishing new 'faith' schools](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/02/education.labour).

 It's a pity, but then this inquiry has been turned into a shambles.

Anyway, is there not an equivalency between McGuinness 'politicising' the PAC, and Enda unilaterally creating a majority on the Banking Inquiry terms-of-reference panel?

Surely if McGuinness is at fault, then Enda is too?

Am I getting this wrong or has Enda reached new bionic-asshole levels of hypocrisy? 





























 I reckon the raw data would be needed to be certain, plus won't the next Dil have less TDs? I wonder if that has been factored in. 




 Up at the top and in the middle column:

"Past vote weighted and adjusted for spiral of silence" which I'm assuming is what point #5 in the first slide means.

"weighting back 50% undecided to how they voted in past elections" - They looked at previous polls and examined how the "Don't knows" ultimately voted in previous general elections and then added that trend into the results. So the difference between the number of first preferences in the new poll and the final seat tally is a combination of the new poll's data weighted for the likely decisions of the "Don't knows" on election day. 




 I think it's mentioned on the first slide at the link, [bullet #4 about weighting](http://i1.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article3680082.ece/alternates/s2197/Screen-Shot-2014-06-12-at-125037.png) the results based on previous poll data.

Also, the fourth slide shows how they extrapolated this new poll data to likely general election seats. 









 But without looking at 'effective' tax rates how would we know the reductive impact of loop-holes on multi-nationals' tax rates? 




 Well that's one way to look at it, here's another:

[Ireland could be in for a windfall, if multinationals here are found to be paying less than their fair share of corporation tax, but the country could also face losing its attraction for such global giants.](http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/multinational-tax-regime-under-threat-from-eu-271338.html)

And at 12.5%, we would still be more attractive than many other EU countries. We would also create some breathing room for Irish companies that want to compete with multi-nationals. 




 Yeap, over [7 years](http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/google-pays-just-014-tax-in-seven-years-28945199.html) that's all they paid. 




 Enda said 

our legislation is very strong and **ethically implemented** and we will defend that robustly.

How are effective tax rates ethical when Irish companies pay 12.5% while it's 0.14% for Google and 3.7% for Apple? How is it ethical for an Irish government to treat Irish companies with this disadvantage?

We can't compete in these areas because of the huge advantage given to these companies. If an Irish government wants a vibrant, successful home-grown IT sector - then don't stack the deck against them.

Irish companies employ the vast majority of people in Ireland 70%. That's the sector we should be helping.

edit: The official press release for the investigation - http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-663_en.htm 
 









 Mr Justice Cooke found as not convincing the accounts that an **wireless AV remote control device for audio and video equipment in GSOC** was connecting and transferring data to an external Bitbuzz hotspot in a nearby caf.

So that was the type of wireless device everyone was wondering about - a remote. And GSOC were certain they'd no Wifi devices in their office. Did they not know the equipment came with a wifi remote? Why were Verrimus worried about it then? It's good to have the report done,  better have a look at [all of it](http://cdn.thejournal.ie/media/2014/06/gsoc-report-final-redacted.pdf) though.

edit - Plenty to read in there:

9.81. The Commissioners expressed the view that the suggestions made in the Rits Report
seeking to undermine the Verrimus Reports are not credible. Furthermore, **the series
of third party efforts made to influence the evidence to be given to the Inquiry by
Verrimus are unexplained and of concern.** They expressed the view that There is no
credible expert opinion that disputes the existence of the threats identified by
Verrimus.

Well, it looks like getting Rits involved was the BS move many thought it was.
 









 Oh, I'd forgotten about that. Cheers! 









 Update: Will be discussed at cabinet tomorrow.

 They'd have to teach Enda how to use encryption first, and I'm guessing they gave up on that.

 There are quite a few decisions that the Irish Data Protection Commissioner should be ashamed of, then again his government isn't investing in his position or powers.

As we can see from [the opulent office](http://www.thedata.co/sites/thedata.co/files/u1/Irish_Data_Protection_Comissioner.png) they gave him outside Dublin, in Portarlington.

This is where the data protection law compliance of Google, Facebook et al are supervised.

It's no wonder the law is changing. 




 No, the Irish Government prevented Vodafone from releasing the data. 




 It's like there was a wilful misinterpretation of Jesus' "suffer the little children" - he did not mean to make children suffer.

What kind of fucking 'christians' were these people?  









 Yeah, the amount of suspicious certs Convergence warns about is scary. 




 BT and Vodafone/C W also operate extensive long distance optical fibre communications networks throughout the UK, installed and paid for by GCHQ, NSA, or by a third and little known UK intelligence support organization called the National Technical Assistance Centre (NTAC).

I imagine you mean activities like the above. I'm not claiming they're beyond reproach - but we don't see O2, Eircom etc. rushing to tell us how many requests they receive. Vodafone wanted to give us more info, it's the Irish government that stopped them. 




 Here's another link:

again, please forgive source 




 Considering Vodafone have volunteered this info, I think they're trying to warn people that there's more going on than we know. 




 But will the government let you know every last detail about what they're up to? No.

So why give them an advantage when they won't return the favour?

Look at our Garda, do you think they'll only check phonecalls because they genuinely have a reason for the search or also because there's a cover-up made easier that way?

You seem quite happy to let the government have a good snoop at people's lives if they think they should. What makes you think you can trust them? 




 .. or If you've nothing to hide then why are they already looking at you?

or If they've nothing to hide then why aren't we looking at them?

Privacy isn't becoming a big issue, it always was a big issue, as well as a human right. People don't need privacy just to hide criminal acts. They need it for dignity, to avoid blackmail, to keep trade secrets and to protect their friends   family.

Run your life with as little of it as possible if it means that little to you. You can start with your real name   address right here :)

 He's texting on his nokia, isn't he?! 




 Certainly, and we can't all become experts in every field - so we rely on news outlets to at least do some hours of research before coming to conclusions.

It's probably not an example of sinister politics but these 'lazy journos' will become unwitting stooges if they (or we) don't cop on.

e.g.

RT: "Analysis of the cases shows people treated for this infection **are four times more likely to have consumed untreated water from a private well.**"

thejournal.ie: "People treated for VTEC **are four times more likely to have consumed untreated water from a private well.**"

The original [HSE report](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/Campaigns/wellsepa.html): "**Analysis of cases shows that people treated for VTEC are four times more likely to have consumed untreated water from a private well.**"

There's nothing wrong with quoting a report, but they both seem to avoid it.

Interestingly enough, the HSE report cites its own sources which in [2009](http://www.hpsc.ie/A-Z/Gastroenteric/VTEC/Factsheet/) makes no specific mention of private water-wells as a vector (though this coincides with the EPA's reporting period of its 30% claim) while another HSE source from [Oct 2013](http://www.hpsc.ie/A-Z/Gastroenteric/VTEC/VTECandwater/) - leads to a claim that "Untreated private water supplies are an important method of spread: VTEC patients are **3 or 4 times more likely** to consume untreated well or other private water than people who do not develop VTEC".

Nevermind the statistical weirdness of comparing VTEC via one vector versus those with no infection, rather than those with VTEC infections via other means.

Anyway, it looks like vague reporting based on skimmed reports compounded by out-of-date and conflicting reporting periods. May as well throw in political interference, it's a mess anyway. 




 Aye, Air Quality measurement and reporting was my job for a while.

There's no chance I would have kept the job by asserting dangers with data that old.

At best I think these reports are overstating a known issue, at worst I think they're serving a viewpoint that does not have any current evidential support.

What I do believe is certain is that RT   the.journal et al have copy and pasted rather than spend an hour or two looking at the source data / reports.

I think the OP is on point with regard to a 'lazy journalism' approach from RT etc.

Is it on point with regard to a politically vested interest, who knows? In RT's case it wouldn't be the first time.

I don't think these concerns should be dismissed automatically.  




 Pity it's not a water quality report. 




 Room-temp fusion, or GTFO 




 Ya won't have the advantage of interpretive dance though ;) 




 In fairness, it's not like they'll pay for the parking themselves. 




 Would seem like a stretch, wouldn't it? As for the EPA, I've no clue - but RT toeing the government line is not a new feature. They'll just do what they're told.

Hard to credit 5 year old data being so worthy of attention though, especially considering that private wells are not the main source of VTEC infections.

I'm sure there will be barbeque / food-safety PSAs soon which will address the major source. 




 T is best news agency, was once only agency - those were days my friend.

Children were cattle, cattle were profit, bullshit was money and the church was wealthy. 




 Very possibly, though we don't know how much the water will cost per litre yet ;)

Though for [the numbers](http://www.independent.ie/business/personal-finance/want-to-dodge-water-bills-with-a-well-heres-the-drill-30053308.html), it's around 4,500 to 5,000 - you can get a grant which will cover no more than 2,031.58. So around 3,000 all in.

If water charges are at the estimated 420 per year, then ~7 years using as much water as you like! Of course if the water charges go up, then it would take less time to recoup the investment. Plus it won't have that taste of treatment. 




 Based on data from 2007 to 2009, strange that it's news now. 




 Cheers, though the E.Coli. data has no context for the likely contamination vector. Plus the EPA's data covers 2007-2009, strange that it's in the news now.

I'm calling bullshit on this one. Well-water is undoubtedly a contributory source but by no means **the** only source of concern. It's not even the main source of infection, that would be food. 




 There was a u-turn on that one after the uproar:

http://www.freedominfo.org/2013/11/irish-minister-changes-course-on-fees-for-foi-requests/

I'm sure they'll try again when they think no-one's looking.
 




 I've been looking around for the report that's mentioned but can't find it at:

http://www.epa.ie/water/dw/hhinfo/ 

Does anyone know where it is? 




 They've been in a sputtering phase for a while:

Though preventing Europe from acting as a bloc will always be on the US wish-list, regardless of the think-tank. 




 Yeah, I think it's a sponsored piece by Vodaphone. Which I notice the Irish Times has in its 'Sponsored Section' while the gang in the Irish Examiner have in its main news section, cheeky. 




 The moves are said to have caused outrage among newsroom staff who argue that the unpredictable nature of news gathering often means last-minute taxis have to be booked.

Or buy some second-hand cars with the savings from not getting taxis and flying first   business class. You know, rocket science. 














 Just as well (hurr) I get mine checked every year.

Calm down Volvic, it's purer than yours. 




 Among the cables specifically identified in one document as currently being intercepted or on cover are an Irish connection, **Hibernia Atlantic**, landing in Southport, and three European connections landing at Yarmouth, Dover, and Brighton.

Which I imagine is this [Hibernia Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernia_Atlantic), who provide "financial customers and the trading community low-latency routes to financial exchanges and data centers" and it's all starting to make sense now why they're tapped.

 If it's the 'local lunatics' you mean - then my town has a few plastic-bag men. They just walk around most days, frequently with a plastic-bag that has little or nothing in it. Though perhaps it's for company or purpose on the huge amount of walking they all do.

There's probably a business opportunity there for people who need their dogs walked, and for these poor souls to have better company on their walks, plus a bit of canine therapy.

I think the Fall had a song about them, 'Carrier-Bag Man', decades later they're still going around.

 Here's a recipe:

http://www.cashelblue.com/official-recipe/cashel-blue-steak-and-chips/  




 Which is one part of voting for the EPP I don't understand, from the above link:

* Strengthening of the common immigration and asylum policy and integrating immigrants

Voting for an EPP candidate means increasing the chances that someday immigration is dealt with by a central, federal authority - not nationally.

A possibility I imagine a lot of FG voters wouldn't like.

We can see it in France where the huge vote for the Front National stemmed from this very issue. Marine Le Pen has made stopping further EU integration her #1 priority because she believes the EU will take that national immigration decision away.

Front National scare me much more than the EPP, though I reckon a lot of people in Ireland would want to keep immigration decisions at the national level just like FN do - yet have voted EPP anyway. 




 Let's cut to the [real reason Enda](https://i.imgur.com/5HcjHTD.jpg) 




 Bring O'Reilly a few coffees will ya? 




 Yeah, that seems to be the issue.

And there's raw data on the site, so back later ...

edit:

So a quick little copy   paste of the raw data excluding city councils, http://pastebin.com/cfDCq00d, and Meath's spend per capita is the lowest in the country!! It must be the lack of people, historical attractions or vast distance from Dublin.

If there's a better place to post excel sheets, please let me know. 




 Ah, my mistake.

However Monday or no, the country expects appropriate apostrophes. 




 Jaysus, Meath underspend on **every** category compared to the national average. Housing, environment   recreation all seem to have the most underspend - which makes sense when you go around the place.

That said my local town is much improved during this period of austerity. It's hard to believe the state it was in while the boom era money flowed. Goes to show how much mismanagement was going on and more to be done apparently. 




 Oh very true, but as long as the survey was carried out properly - it is better than guessing. 




 Enda, back to 'work' 




 I wonder if that question was rephrased to 'do you support further transfer of competencies to Europe' what the answers would have been like?

There's so many good findings in that report, I wouldn't have expected a greater portion of FF voters against same-sex marriage than FG for instance - though the country overall is in favour. 




 Remind yourself to always read the question two or three times before starting your answer.

Also, the initial surge in adrenalin / panic at the start of an exam subsides after ~15 mins. So if you spend the first 15 mins, checking the questions you're going to answer and preparing them. You should feel much calmer for the rest of it.

 I hope you lose ya gobshite, and maybe just maybe you will:

TV3, represented by Marcus Dowling BL, opposed the application. It was argued the  Minister, in seeking to amend his claim, was seeking to "gloss over" serious factual  inaccuracies in his original statement of claim. These inaccuracies had not been properly explained by the Minister, counsel added.

Mr Justice Paul Gilligan ruled the Minister was entitled to amend his statement of claim. The case will be listed for hearing before a Judge and jury at a future date. 









 He does give off an aura of being at 'arms length' from the seedy side.

 If Alan Shatter's shenanigans get linked to Enda, that could be sooner rather than later.

Meanwhile Sherlock, a TD for Cork East, has re-entered the race having **earlier this week ruled himself out** of both the leader and deputy leadership contests.

I want to [be] part of the process of renewal of this party, he said in a statement.

To do that I feel that the position of deputy leader will allow me to assist to rebuild the organisation. 

I believe I have the energy and the capability to try this agenda with a new party leader and I look forward to the election taking place.

http://www.thejournal.ie/alan-kelly-labour-leader-bid-1491106-May2014/

He sounds like a boiler-plate covering letter for a job application, and the infinitives - ahhhh. 









 So we know Callinan covered-up the problems in the Garda, we know Alan Shatter failed in his duty to investigate those problems (negligence or cover-up) plus that they were close professionally and now all that's left is what Enda knew and did?

That's the whole deal here, isn't it?

If Enda can be linked to the cover-ups / negligence of Callinan  /or Shatter his position as Taoiseach would be very shaky.

 It very much is, and the original Wolfenstein levels are playable within the game as an easter egg :) 


































 Again there's no winning, there are dead children on both sides.

It is unforgivable regardless of who does it or why it is done.

The idea that one side is more at fault than the other after all these years only prolongs the conflict and increases the number of dead.

Grief isn't ameliorated because a tally of corpses can be tilted to one side or another - it is just unbearable, radicalising grief. 




 I'm sure of that.

Human nature, on the other hand, is fairly similar globally.

Killing kids creates angry, violent parents anywhere. 




 I'll be sounding like Mutley for the next few minutes then :( 




 Which is great, but it's also politically dependent.

Remove the political support from the US and how much investment would happen organically / naturally?

To have sustainable investment there needs to be sustainable peace. 




 That's just exactly what the UK government thought about the IRA - it was horrific in its consequences, e.g. the Manchester bombing.

There's no 'winning' just blood, guts, misery   grief.

Guerilla warfare doesn't care about military strength, it circumvents it.

 




 A better negotiation position is never going to be a bad idea. Hamas' election wasn't going to be a welcome development but it was entirely predictable.

Hamas being elected is a revenge vote, not entirely unheard of in Israeli politics either - or anywhere else for that matter.

Furthering settlements will further the appeal of Hamas and their ilk.

Guerilla warfare is insidious and does not need a 'nation state' to support it.

If Hamas is to be stopped, then their supporters need to be given a better solution. Nobody voted for the IRA in NI, they voted for Sinn Fin - the political wing associated with the IRA but not the IRA. A debate still continues about how much hair-splitting that actually was but it was enough to keep the ball rolling to peace.

It's not a fast process, the 'Troubles' in NI were decades long.

Margaret Thatcher signing the Anglo-Irish agreement wasn't something her manifesto suggested when she came to power but it happened.

Yet afterwards was no picnic at all - there were still bombs and horrific violence. Nonetheless without it, there wouldn't have been grounds to find a more lasting solution.

It's a bunch of people who know the final jigsaw picture, but not sure of where the pieces they hold go. Yet they don't give up, because they want their grandchildren to have better lives. 




 And the Palestinian factions are going to think exactly the same, it will never end if that's the basis. 




 Children are precisely what fundamentalists are indoctrinating.

If they didn't care about children this problem would fade out over 3 generations. 




 Perhaps, but the NI take on Catholicism vs. Protestantism created divisions much fiercer than their common origins would suggest.

It may not be the best comparison, but it's not so wide of the mark either. Plus, religion was used as a proxy for territorial disputes which I reckon brings the comparison closer. 




  they were almost dead from lack of watering

Ah now Ted, Flowers   Fruits are thirsty business.

 




 Nope 




 All of what you said is completely valid, and it's all happened before. If it was going to work it would have worked by now.

It's time to try something new, overdue really - nobody is feeling safer.

Hamas are lunatics, shooting stone-throwing kids at a border is also lunacy. There's no gain in any of these tactics on either side.

If the idea is that one side should 'win', both sides will lose something.

What international investors will decide on the region if they think their business will blow up or that they must pick one over the other while risking retaliation from the side they didn't pick.

It's not going to be remotely easy, but both sides vote for people to fix this not prolong it. The begrudgery won't end for years, but as the NI process has shown peace needs to come first - the pointing fingers can come later.

An Israel and a Palestine that can live together will be a much stronger force in the region than one that wants to destroy each other. 




 I think the only answer is negotiation.

It seemed intractable and pointless in NI, but endless grieving is much worse than making elected reps sit at the table for years if necessary.

Plus, the current solution in NI didn't involve border changes - but a real assessment of the damage caused to both sides by both sides.

The 'who is at fault' argument has lost its usefulness. Let the next generation be a bit less used, and a bit more educated.

Bit by bit progress, not blow by blow status quo.

 




 For real and for once, won't somebody think of the children.

There is no future in the current path, only the past.

The stable peace in Northern Ireland isn't because everyone decided to like each other. They decided to stop letting their children pay for their parents (mostly) 




 So will reading this comment or its link get NSA-flagged?

Should I delete this because I want to see my friends in the US or should I just invite them over to me?

Not exactly a tough choice, is there an on-going discussion or data on what all this is doing to US tourism?

If I do have to go the US soon, I reckon I'll be going tech-nude. 




 Though judging from the photos I don't think I'll be bringing any of my 'trainees' with me.

 This man is a menace to Irish society.

First he picks Greyhound for refuse collection against the advice of **all** Dublin City Councils.
Greyhound have their registration in the Isle of Man with its more generous tax options, as well as a laundry list of court cases against them.

The Isle of Man is, coincidentally, also home to a number of pension and investment funds that specialise in Refuse   Recycling. Pension   Investment funds being more focused on end results (profits) than working conditions, living wages etc. for any company in their portfolios.

Surprise, surprise - here we are a little later with 30% payroll cuts being mooted for Greyhound employees who have now gone on strike as a result. Is Greyhound part of an investment portfolio? I don't know - but it sure looks like it.

Then Irish Water and its mystery charges which were meant to be detailed this week, after several other 'deadlines' have been missed. He infamously stated that he didn't know all the costs involved or why Irish water was spending so much money on consultants. Though simultaneously insisted that his department knew all the costs involved.

The free allowance for Children is also to be cut apparently, but we don't know those details either.

Let's not forget his commitment to reducing quangos and increasing transparency in county council spending - only to then shelve the report on it and, naturally, create a new quango instead.

The man is not remotely true to his word, his actions have had consequences that range from the frankly suspicious to the stunningly callous.

It also worth noting that in his declaration of interests to the Dil he has **no** assets, apart from a gifted membership of the K Club. No house in his name, no investments of any kind. Or in other words, someone who could be very easily persuaded by a tempting bribe (assuming the declaration to be honest).

 According to the BBC, [Murray's nationality](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BrjWHJ-CQAAZnvp.png:large) is result dependent. 




 Strawberry plants usually have a useful life of 2 to 3 years, planting the runners of the first and subsequent plants to keep your stock vital.

Though that doesn't appear to be the problem here, so I'm guessing it's either the soil or the amount of sun.

 Well, project Morpheus will be great for games just like the Oculus Rift will but of course that's not the only thing VR can be good for.

Something like 'Second Life' with a VR interface seems like a logical next step and potentially a VR killer-app, but Sony are unlikely to get or ask for detailed Second Life data. The solution, they made their own.

Ok, Home was a bit more basic but it still had plenty of valid data points they could analyse: PSN ID data, movement through Home-space itself, spending habits if any, network congestions in a shared 3D world and even simple collision data (very handy to know for VR to avoid nausea).

Home got such derision and sneering it was hard to see why Sony kept at it, unless it provided useful data for some other purpose. My guess is that that purpose is shared with Project Morpheus.

Someone or some company is eventually going to make the first commercial   global 'baby Matrix' and I think Sony want to be in with the best chance they can.

I don't think Facebook bought Oculus just because they could - they want FB users to 'walk' via Facebook   Oculus through a global VR world.

I think Sony have been giving a 'baby Matrix' more thought and work than Facebook: e.g. PS Move, 3D in general and Morpheus itself.

That task would be much better with actual 3D world usage data. It just looked like Home so none of us really noticed. 
 









 Thankfully it did no damage to [Children's Shoes](http://www.rte.ie/archives/exhibitions/1333-memorable-budgets/1338-budget-1982/).

 




 I reckon Sony got some data useful to Project Morpheus from it. It's point otherwise ...

It reminds me of debate over the Hydrogen fuel-cell car or the Electric Battery car - both have their plus points. But one already has infrastructure in every house in the country, so I'm guessing we'll end up with the other, Hydrogen, because lobbying.

I reckon fuel companies don't want people charging batteries with solar panels and the like because there's no money in that for them. 




 My guess was as a business measure in favour of ISPs. If we'd gone the ESB line route - everyone could have had standard speed internet practically overnight.

Every plug socket potentially becoming a network port - brilliant. 




 Great! I'm going to be walking around the garden looking for more now. And not that I'd need an excuse to go to France but that will do.

Cheers! 




 Thanks! Now I know how to tell the difference between Dragonflies   Damselflies.

 Make sure to pilot it on all your staff worldwide for a year then, including yourself Larry. 




 I think this says more about E3 than No Man's Sky. 

Many AAA ~~games~~ publishers seem to follow Hollywood (teasers, trailers, reveals ...
) rather than capitalising on games' unique opportunities with a Hollywood flair.
 
The AAA scene is hamster-wheeling on pre/se-quels. 

So I'm waiting till games reach the bargain-bin as there's no rush to play re-skinned games anyway. Though these days that means little against pre-order sales.

I hope No Man's Sky is great and maybe it becomes the 'Forbidden Planet' of sci-fi gaming.

Yet for every 'reveal' of any game I see - I think of one of the first reddit comments I read:

Actual Gameplay Video or GTFO 




 The Tuna is always mine.

The Hound and Baby Dinosaurs Die Tonight. 




 It's been shite even before the WC.

Just more noticeable now, I think they gave up on it a year ago.

It needs a back to the drawing-board revision, even the colour scheme manages to look ancient now. 




 Using my amateur insect sleuthing, I reckon they are 'springtails' which like damp:

http://www.rentokil.ie/pest-guides/insects-and-spiders/insects-in-damp-conditions/springtail/index.html 

Get rid of the damp and they'll go elsewhere as they need moisture to survive, and hoovering them up seems to be the best starting point. They don't like thyme oil or clove oil either apparently.

 Does the report on a minister's failure of duty not make this one a little special? 




 Wouldn't be the first wonder:

 I think many will stay too, and there has to be pan-EU agreement.

It would be great to see the educational advantage of a base in Ireland re-asserted above the clearly targeted loopholes. 




 It's no wonder the Quinns are challenging everything when the bar is this low. 




 True, but there's no need to make the front door-bell that easy to push. 









 Still covered, the Department of Finance can disappear any type of document you need.  




 Again, not a deal breaker (for example, TDs aren't constrained by the new Leinster House web-surfing rules) 




 the move will have to be signed off at the next Council session and countries will have until the end of next year to enshrine it in national law.

So if the prevailing view that we need to allow these loopholes for jobs is correct, then by the end of 2015 a lot of multinationals will start leaving and less will arrive. 









 There's buckets of precedent for that in Dil ireann - don't let it put you off.

 I just heard it, I think it's great - though 'cynical noodle bunny' sounds better. 




 The narrative that Ireland presents internationally is that of the cute survivor of British colonisation. The reality is that the abused turned abuser a long time ago. Dissent is not welcome.

 The teller reckoned rubbing the scanner on the barcode was the way to do it. It was too late after the first rub. 




 I got out of a fine because of this type of messing.

Got 80 fine, went to local Garda station told "you can't pay that here, go to the Post Office".

I went to the Post Office, and it wouldn't scan in - the barcode fading more each time a scan was attempted. Then the number was typed in manually, but the system glitched as it had partially processed one of the supposedly failed scans.

Nothing more to do in the Post Office, I went back to the Garda and explained and they said a new fixed fine notice would be sent out.

Then a new notice to say the fine had gone up because I hadn't paid the first one. I called to explain what had happened and yes a new notice would be sent.

Never happened.

The Garda I talked to didn't give a shit. 




 Just for visitors though, TDs are still on a behave-yourself basis.

That's worked so well before etc. etc. 









 Is it true that if the EU investigation into Apple's tax deals goes against Apple that the 'missing' tax has to given back to the Exchequer?

Sounds like there would be more than 2bn there.

Is that the background to all this? That there will be no help from the EU until corporate tax avoidance is changed? 




 The court case will be an eye-opener that's for sure, I can't imagine they have a hope. They went from a 5% share in Anglo to a 28% share over 3 years.

Plus the 'regulator' hated them enough to actually do his job and give the Quinn group a record 3.25 million fine for insurance shenanigans.

Then there's everyone's car insurance having gone up as a result. 




 So they were forced to take out a 2.34 billion loan?

How did Anglo manage to do that to them?

 Then there was that whole [hospital donation fiasco](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/garth-brooks-awarded-1-million-in-hospital-lawsuit/), which legally went his way - though you've got to wonder how he was commemorating his mother's memory with it. 




 Haven't read the book but apparently it doesn't really explain the disappearances either.

Nonetheless, I'm leaving the Leftovers until there's an opinion on the whole season.

Also never going to a movie that Lindelof has had anything to do with: Cowboys   Aliens, Prometheus, Into Darkness, World War Z. I'm surprised he gets writing offers. 




 I don't remember Malaria being a threat in Japan either.

 As I understand it, this would have involved the BND clearly breaking the German constitution. 

I guess that reveals the NSA's approach to such legal frameworks more than the German government's response to the offer.

edit: In fairness, /u/trot-trot your recent comment history looks like someone on auto-pilot or beyond frustration or replaced by a bot. Your points are going to be lost with such walls of text   links.  




 Sorry about the THE 









 If the NSA were as successful and useful as they claim they are, the Boston Marathon bombings would never have happened. The culprits would have been caught in flagrante as a show-of-strength and a public reminder of the NSA's value to the US. They were even given specific warnings about the brothers from Russian agencies.
 




 When I remember the internet is ~20 years old, I reckon the NSA have all the info they need to blackmail any USA politician for life.

They must be able to de-rail the political campaigns of anyone they choose with simple innuendo, shame   embarrassment. They'd keep evidence of wrong-doing, if any, as a trump card.

So if someone wants to get into politics in the US without their say-so, they would have to avoid all interent   voice coms from the day they were able to use them until the end of a successful campaign - i.e. next to impossible.

Can we rename them the **N**osy **S**tealth **A**dministration now? 




 'driven by jedward' 




 Just tried his name via DuckDuckGo and there are plenty of links about it, couldn't see the Herald one admittedly.

This one is a toughie I reckon, I can see why maybe after 5 or 10 years - someone should be allowed to 'live things down' especially when there's no obvious 'public interest', the event isn't a continuing one or the people involved aren't politicians etc.

But it's just going to be so near-impossible, then the Streisand effect ... 




 It's hit   miss, but such a good place for a rest during Christmas shopping. 




 Tis only a mild detour though, then a quick rest in Grogan's on the way and they'll be nearly there :) 




 I want to hold them responsible for poisoning national conversations with bullshit   lies.

Then of course there's all the hacking they're currently in and out of court for. 




 This one, definitely this one - you can add the Stag's Head in too on Dame Court. It'll be on your way from Hogan's to McDaid's anyway. 




 True, I'm hoping the need for water might make this one special though. 




 Jesus Tapdancing Christ, can the government set up a commissioner to slap Phil Hogan every time he wants a glass of water!

And:

It was confirmed yesterday by Taoiseach Enda Kenny that Irish Water is to be taken out of the control of the Department of Environment, which is now run by Labour's Alan Kelly, and brought under the auspices of Michael Noonan's Department of Finance.

If Fine Gael think they'll survive privatising water, I'd like to see them try. 









 And he couldn't even cost the water charges for everyone before he left, after 3 years.

Am I right in thinking that he still has to be approved in the EU before he can take the post?

Oh, there will be a by-election too I suppose, or does he keep both? 




 "Any differences that we have are most effectively resolved through established **private channels**, not through the media"

Are there any left?

 Such a happy looking lad that Patrick Coveney ;) 




 I'd like to know the reasoning / market-forces behind the Price of New Games in the EU region (Sterling prices too), my views:

* All main platforms are x86 based these days - I thought this would have helped reduce dev costs and so prices.

* Game assets are built high-res to ensure PC porting (if not already done on PC beforehand anyway)

* It's making me avoid release-day purchases as I can spend that 25 difference on many other games, and frankly other things in life, especially when I can't see a 25 improvement in next-gen games overall.

* It's not just a Sony thing, so apologies if this sounds targeted, but at the current prices I won't be getting release-day games anyway.

* The Second-Hand market is having a field-day with this, so I can't see how the current pricing is benefiting devs.

* Counter-point, games like Watch_Dogs are selling anyway - but I can't be in a small minority, so I reckon a 'market-starvation' effect will be short-lived and ultimately will back-fire.

 




 And now they're calling for an inquiry into policing? What are they going to find?

 If anyone is wondering, Ming needs a reality check on climate change and he'll need to make it clear:

[Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan asked the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Information  Brendan Howlin in regard to his recent statement that climate change deniers need to be swept aside, if he is aware that everyone accepts that the climate has been, is and always will be changing, though there are many, including eminent climatologists and scientists, who question whether that change is anthropological, or man-made; the way in which he will sweep these people aside; and if he will make a statement on the matter."](http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/DebatesWebPack.nsf/takes/dail2014043000062#N6) 




 Which seems to be a pity. I think it was on an old Vincent Brown that Elaine Byrne talked about tribunal costs - an alarming 500 million yet also recouped 1 billion.

I've tried to find a link, but can't.

Though I suppose the chances in this case of recouping money via a tribunal would be, at least politically, zero. 




 Ah, thanks for the clarification.

I guess we won't be getting a tribunal any time soon then. 




 Does this mean that the banking inquiry can go to the High Court to unseal those cabinet meetings?

Has there been a discussion about this already that I've missed? 














 If he wants to pontificate about getting 67 billion back, he has my blessings. 




 I'm not sure people are forgetting it, I think they're just ignoring it. 




 hehehe 




 Bloody hell, that link.

If only TDs were in such a rush for legislation that actually helped the whole country. 




 I'm not sure how accurate that is but it's nice to hear something about it mentioned in the EU. 

I think the EU is going to suit Ming more than the Dil did. 









 I thought this was a joke piece when I saw the headlines.

Are TDs really going to spend political capital assuaging Garth Brooks   Aiken's greed?

There were both happy to go with 3 concerts at the outset and they still can.

If they don't want **their** original plan anymore, well too fucking bad for them.

And TDs saying this is damaging Ireland's reputation need to shut it, their abject fawning over a few concerts certainly is making us look like eejits. 




 I think tweeting the PS3 master key that geohot unearthed spelled the end of that relationship. 




 In conjunction with games being storable on an external hard-drive, could there be an additional hacking risk / vector in allowing this feature?

It's the first reason for cancelling it that popped into my head. 




 Into a 3v voucher is about the only thing I can think of, not exactly using the account online but nearish. 




 For added confusion here are two other articles on it that appear to contradict each other:

http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/govt-defeated-in-seanad-vote-on-free-gp-care-for-under-6s-635858.html

http://www.thejournal.ie/government-loses-another-seanad-vote-1562521-Jul2014/ 









 And if Garth truly

"cannot begin to tell you how badly my heart is breaking right now 

he'd be happy to play 3 rather than none. 




 Cheers! 









 Another thing that needs to change is the price tag in the EU, 75 (~$100) is too much for a new AAA.

I've gone from being a regular release-day buyer on the PS3 (where new games are 50 to 55) to a definite second-hand buyer on the PS4.

The games haven't suddenly become 25 better or more interesting, the reverse if anything.

So the lull in gaming for me will probably last till December, when I'll be able to buy games for a reasonable price.

So glad I went for Wolfenstein at 50 on release, rather than Watch Dogs at 75. 









 Surprising as that is, and rumour-mill notwithstanding, this:

 I've my keys handy already ;) 




 Aye, it's in less of a mood now.

And it's way too sunny to be looking at settings anyway. 




 Good, better than yesterday morning which was a false no-hangover followed by the real hangover in the afternoon.

Nonetheless managed to go to a debate on the 'right-to-be-forgotten' at the Hay festival which while more introductory than anything else was still interesting.

Susan O'Keefe recounted the story of a teacher who told her students to bring an embarrassing photo into school the following day and they'd put it on the school gates.

The students were understandably horrified. To which the teacher replied 'well you put them up online everyday' and the students seemed to get the point.

The representatives from Google   Transparency International were good too - the debate could have gone on for hours I reckon. Probably just as well that it didn't though, the hangover came back with a vengence. Naps were had.

So today I'm all sparkly, up at 7 trying to work out why my home-server is in a mood (or at least the powerline plugs are) and looking forward to the food tent's Beer   Tapas thing at 6 today.

Kinda wish it was earlier. 




 I thought this was resolved, there can be 3 concerts which is already 3 more than the agreement with the residents allows. 




 Today in fail upwards ... 









 I think you're confusing questions with word-salad.

Edit: So didn't get the chance to ask the question, they were limited to questions on WWI in line with his new book. He was excellent, and comes across as not so glowering unless he encounters bullshit which was only one of the questions asked. Great talk, 10/10. 




 it's not meant to be serious, look at the guinness one 




 Just as a side note:

[The Communist Party of Ireland has still not submitted the required statutory documentation [on campaign donations] and the commission referred a file on the matter to the Garda on May 19th.](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/files-on-fg-ff-political-donations-referred-to-garda%C3%AD-1.1854072) 




 I'd love to see it too. 

The geographical, geopolitical and theological-cultural* advantages they would have would be astonishing.

My grandparents could never have imagined the Queen of England would have an official visit to Ireland but it happened, it was great and there were no problems.

*I'm sure there's a better word for that, but I'm off to sleep now. 




 All terrible awful things and seemingly intractable in terms of negotiation. But did Hamas spring from nothing? No it sprang from how they feel they are treated.

It doesn't forgive their views or aims, but it does indicate how to weaken them as a driving force in this lengthy conflict. If Hamas are the obstacle then the solution is stop letting them have causes and events they can point to for support.

NI isn't like Israel, but once UK forces killed civilians in Bloody Sunday the conflict radically altered. Similarly, Israel's sometimes disproportionate responses to provocations and Palestinian violence gives Hamas all the cause they need to garner more support.

Cooler heads have to prevail, or the conflict really will be endless. 




 All very important distinctions in history, but the point I wanted to make was about the possibility of similar solutions, or at least the real possibility of a solution. Something NI didn't have for a good while.

Nothing improved in NI until everyone decided the negotiation table was better than attending funerals, and preventing further radicalising events.

As for calls to genocide by Hamas, they are crazy and also not every Palestinian.

Calls to wipe out Catholics / Protestants / Republicans / Unionists haven't vanished in NI either but the anger   grief necessary to create those views has reduced.

tl;dr - Negotiations are the only way out, anything else will be genocide for one side or the other. And if that happens, 50 years from now threads like these will still be posted.

 




 True, but then again the Middle-east has had 1,500 years.

 Do you still think the UK and Ireland are the same thing? 




 here are some Irish sites

First up, blogs.telegraph.co.**uk**

tell me more about 'how i know nothing about Ireland'

I just have, but here are some more, children in Ireland are not taught anti-semetic or anti-Israel anything in any official sense.

That some schools take their own view, bear in mind your examples are based in very religious areas of Ireland, isn't right but then we don't check out schools every day with every teacher and I doubt any country does.

Though in my schooling, the very same system, we were given a very positive view of Israel and Israelis.

I still have a fantastic series of jewish artwork on my walls reprinted from a very old jewish calendar. My brother spent considerable time in kibbutz and is still in contact with people he met there.

I still can't believe you think a .uk is an Irish site, are you trolling yourself?

With regard to your sources, there are practically all blogs and opinion pieces. 




 Didn't think this was still a thing, except on inviable routes.

All the coaches I see around are private hires.

 I'm really happy with it.

I didn't have to do anything 'exotic' with XBMC, yet have all the advantages of a central store and I created a home-server at the same time.

If this is your first Pi, be advised I've about 4 of them in active service, and am thinking of reasons to buy more :)

Though for the home-server itself I went with an Odroid U3. 




 Could you set up an NFS share on the main PC and then XBMC on all the RPIs can connect to that?

They would all be working off of the same store of PC data so can all be updated with one click or on auto whenever the PC data is changed.

It's how I do mine. 




 This [touch screen](http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G140383714860) has me tempted at $120. 




 I'm using [Rune Audio](http://www.runeaudio.com/) with a [Wolfson DAC](http://www.element14.com/community/community/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-accessories/wolfson_pi) that plugs into the Pi's board.

The sound is fantastic, and anything with a web browser can control it.

I'll be making a lot of them for friends and family. 




 "Previously unacknowledged Extraterrestrials quit Ireland for the OP8 system as long-standing ya-will/ah-no-shure custom fades"

Solar System Weekly, 2022. 




 You're a lovely poster :) 




 Yeap, it just went into my 'buy when in the bargain bin after the exclusive period ends' column.

I'm assuming it's a timed-exclusive, or SE have really lost their marbles.

Christmas 2015, there'll be a ton of other games to spend my money on.

 




 Has some violent moments in it, but I think it's extraordinary.

HBO are making a version of it soon apparently. 




 Utopia is the only tv show I can think of with this as a central concept. 





























 Oh if they can turn it into a baby-Matrix they'll be on to a winner, and I think they know it too. Plus they have the advantage of all that PS Home data.

Oculus, on the other hand, have Facebook data.

I guess time will tell which one brings in the heads. 




 I really enjoyed salt shooter and few others, but the 'queues' to play many of the games were ridiculous.

 Ah, reform - there's no money in that apparently, hence Kerins et al.

Though, more seriously, your point about the courts is well taken.

If the pay, pensions etc. to people such as Kerins and Flanney were simply stopped - they would have to go to the courts to get satisfaction.

So in turn providing an opportunity to explain in front of a judge and the country why the government feels uncomfortable giving them any more money in light of their actions.

It is the public airing of these issues that makes K   F squirm - the government doesn't seem to scare them at all. 




 Because medical care is more important than the remuneration of two people who created a financial vehicle to enhance their salaries instead of the efficacy of the institution that employed them at a significant expense to the taxpayer? 




 Which is galling when Sony co-created DLNA

 Give [Lubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu) a try, it still has a GUI but is nice and light so shouldn't tax your old laptop much.

It should soften any learning curves before you go completely headless. 




 Yeah, kinda like the problem illustrated ... 




 Also, men don't understand: the toilet roll requirements, the psychological benefits of daily hygiene, 'bills are boomerangs' and clothes aren't really furniture.

On the flipside: noises are noises, hairpins are bathroom items, your hair is yours to clean-up, and preparation is no guarantee of success nor a panacea for calm.

 We're talking about a country that's thrived after two nuclear bombs - survived one of the biggest recorded earthquakes, then a tsunami and a nuclear plant meltdown in short order.

A Mount Fuji eruption could be devastating, and there's still no firm idea when that will happen.

Yet if there's any country that can manage such a disaster, it will be Japan.

 Well they are that, and fairly fetching with the right legs.

There has been one murrrder by now, I take it. Not Mr. Lederhosen? 




 I'm watching Under the Dome and I want to climb into the tele and give at least half of them some brain-boosting vitamins. 




 Absolutely, but who likes commands without switches ;)

 You're only up to Brookside!? You've another decade and a bit to go so. 




 Repeats the last command you typed with 'sudo' at the start of it. 




 Ah, then my local xtravision (maybe chain-wide) is being a little cheeky / just emerging from financial-ruin.

Second-hand newish games are ~60, games like Killzone and Knack are ~30. 




 multi channel Pale

giggles (and so true, well 3 more channels including the red-triangle waving Channel 4)

Though as someone who spent time growing up in multi-cP and uni-cElsewhere, I reckon Breda fell between the stools of her mind. 




 Yeap, the very place (and my only local option). 




 Glad it's not a widespread thing, but I've no chance in my local.

I've asked, but the staff get that middle-distance look on their face and give a mumbled no. They look a bit too harried for me to pester them any further.

I'll just wait till the second-hands come down in price so. I'd like to try Watch_Dogs but at 75 new or 60 second-hand plus the current sentiment on the game it doesn't seem worth it.

 All it was missing for me was the electricity power, I missed zooming along train-tracks and power-lines. 




 To be exact, the internet does nothing of the kind.

It's people who populate the echo chambers, exhibiting a behaviour that no internet law will really curtail and is prevalent everywhere.

After ~20 years of the web, we're still getting used to the audience our conversations and posts can have but we were always having these conversations.

Plus, unsavoury ideas are much better out in the open, where they can be seen and argued against. 




 Well there's an exception to every rule, and /b/ is the exception to quite a few of them.

As well as a worthy addition to a hosts.deny file of any concerned parent.

Nonetheless, if a kid is bullied on facebook and the like - they will get traced. IRL bullying is not so easy to verify or respond to. 




 It is indeed bigger, but that's not a problem either.

It's a great time for parents   kids to remind themselves that on-line fora / chat-boards are not reality and need to be taken with a pinch-of-salt.

Bullying is another matter, but one that is actually easier to solve in its on-line forms than its IRL forms. 




 The thing about group-think is that it can happen everywhere you have a group of people, on-line social networks are nothing new in that regard. 









 This part is also comical:

The internet may be socialising young people into near-absolute conformity when they have not yet developed sufficient maturity to realise what is happening

And Rock Music will lead to Satanism, yadda yadda yadda ...

Nevermind taking it as an argument to remove religion from students' school education as **it may** create a near-absolute conformity when they have not yet developed sufficient maturity to realise what is happening.

It's another missed opportunity from Breda to have a sensible debate or write a coherent piece on the variety of influences that are literally at everyone's fingertips, not only the school-aged.

All those column inches, to end with the stunning insight that parents should really parent. 









 That's great, thanks! 




 [Utopia](http://www.channel4.com/programmes/utopia/episode-guide) and only 8 episodes so far, couldn't stop watching it. And have already re-binged it.  




 I wish my local library did this, I feel Amazon has managed to privatise the library system without anyone really noticing.

How does your local library make ebooks 'expire' when the lending period is up?

I thought the Seanad might up its game having come so close to non-existence, but it still looks like a carousel of curmudgeons. 









 A collapsed [pingo](http://basementgeographer.com/pingos-natures-earth-covered-ice-domes/) apparently.

 Sean Sherlock (L)  Moving to become MoS at the Department of Foreign Affairs with Special Responsibility for ODA, Trade Promotion and North South cooperation

Well at least he can't screw up Internet law any more.

It'll be interesting to see how his style of waffle is going to play out in this new role. 









 Which lends credence to the idea that it was never going to be just 2 or 3 concerts from the beginning, cheeky sod.

Well, he took a gamble and it failed or simply his bluff was called. 




 Useless.

I was in a minor fender-bender the other week, 3 distinctly different cars.

After 15 minutes getting everyone's tax details etc., the Senior Garda still didn't know which car belonged to who and accused one of the drivers of giving him incorrect info. Until it was pointed out to him that he was looking at the wrong car.

Never mind the Ban Garda sent out around the town on her own, got a coat thrown over her and beaten up. She was sent out on her own again a few weeks later.

A local thug who assaulted a Garda in the station yet is still free as a bird. Though there's also a laundry list of property damage and assault cases against him.

Utterly bloody useless.



 




 If they were hoping to damage US tech companies a bit more, I reckon they've succeeded. 




 Man, I'm not cynical enough. If he strung this out as a PR exercise he really is some piece of work.

I wonder what his cancellation insurance cover is going to be like, strikes me as the type that will put in a claim. 




 I'm only taking the blame for rainbows near vibrating columns of air.

They'll have to find other gay people for the rest. Though since heatwaves tend to lead to clothing removal, that one shouldn't be too hard.

 But now he has disappointed more, and commercially has nothing to show for that.

 Gawd? 




 Nice guy, instead of disappointing 2/5 of his fans - he disappointed all of them. 




 Thanks! 




 Is there a technical reason for USB v3 not appearing in this revision?

Would it fry the board or something like that? 




 Now there's a pre-order I won't feel conflicted about.

I wonder will it have a keyboard   mouse option?

 The pope has the power to remove any clergy from his church, anywhere.

A priest kicked out would have no home, no CV per se and quite likely little savings.

That's a threat that can summon many things. It's a threat that can keep things in the dark too.

So magical no, real very much so.
 




 My understanding on the ruling was that while the stats clearly show a gender difference, there is no certainty that 'all women' are better drivers than 'all men' - so applying a general trend to an individual case was unfair.

And like you've said - it's swings-and-roundabouts across the risks anyway.  




 I'd forgotten about the non-refusal  high-premium aspect to it all.

When I read 'tied-agent' all my investment product memories came flooding back, ahh I hated seeing some of the numbers there.

Churning investors and pensioners for so little to their own advantage, while looking at the numbers which circumscribed my salary and a salesperson's undeserving commission.

Don't miss that business an iota. 




 Aye, I'm thinking more of SteamOS where I can sandbox the snooping a fair bit more.

And it's not like SteamOS is a complete thing yet, but I'm guessing I'll have a greater control of it than Origin will let me.
