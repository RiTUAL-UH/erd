 ...would they be injecting the water if they weren't fracking? 

And could they frack as cheaply without injecting the water somewhere? If so, why don't they? 

It just seems arbitrary for the public to make the distinction between the fracking process and the fracking wastewater disposal process causing the quakes. It's not like the latter happens without the former... 




 That's probably the stupidest argument I've ever heard. 

And I've spent a lot of time on reddit, so that's really saying something. 

It's like saying "If smoking causes cancer, why don't terrorists just start giving out cigarettes!? Since they're not, obviously smoking doesn't cause cancer!"  




 From a [comment 10 minutes ago, in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/35l2mw/whats_causing_texas_earthquakes_fracking_most/cr5ro87?context=3): 

When they stop fracking the quakes stop, when they start fracking the quakes start again. It can't be a coincidence. The other day we had a 4.0 the other day and we have had some gas mains explode because of this and people lost their lives and their homes. Our gas mains are old and need replaced before they can handle all the movement.

 Yeah well "Foxes actually make great cock house guards" just didn't have quite the same ring...  




 Oh and [about the 2/3rds number](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-06-26/climate-change-and-the-two-thirds-imperative): 

The two-thirds imperative was enunciated in the 2012 edition of the IEAs annual World Energy Outlook: No more than one-third of proven reserves of fossil fuels can be consumed prior to 2050 if the world is to achieve the 2 degrees C goal 




 According to the[ Congressional Research Service](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/just-how-dirty-are-canadas-oil-sands-anyway/2012/05/23/gJQAGdlkkU_blog.html): 

oil from tar sands produces 14 to 20 percent more carbon emissions than other oil the U.S. imports.

So no, this is not a clean fuel alternative. But please, don't let facts keep you from rationalizing and grasping for straws... 




 Yeah I honestly expected some right-wing outrage about a foreign company using big government to steal private property of ordinary Americans, but by and large it's only the locals who seem to care (on the conservative side anyway.)  




 The point is that the science is telling us we need to leave 2/3rds of known fossil fuel reserves in the ground. 

How, then, does it make sense to build NEW fossil fuel infrastructure? 

It's like your doctor telling you to go on a diet, and instead you sign up for a rewards card at Cinnabon. 

And I don't think anyone (well informed) thinks stopping KXL will have a major effect on the industry. But it's like the divestment campaign, it's meant to revoke their social license to operate. 




 The Jargon-Believability relationship is a strong one. With your formal training, there is great shitty potential. 

I don't know the fancy names for things (and am too lazy to look up), so I just resort to using nature documentary syntax to make them believable. 




 If the pipeline doesn't make it cheaper to transport the oil, why would they build it? 

Do you really think the industry that knows it's destroying the climate but continues anyway is pushing a pipeline on environmental grounds, and not for its profit?

 /r/science has rules against the sort of psuedoscience that breitbart publishes consistently, so it's not just my bias but that pesky liberal bias many claim reality has... 




  Doing that might make fracking non-cost effective

Then no, it's not a different discussion. Fracking is used because it's the cost is just slightly lower than the price they can sell it for. If they can't pump the water underground without treatment, they can't frack. They can't frack, no earthquakes... 




 Yes, why aren't terrorists engaging in incredibly expense oil drilling technology that produces small earthquakes sometimes in some locations? 

Such a good question. You're so very very smart. I'm surprised the CIA hasn't picked you up to be a super-spy-genius-counter-terrorist yet.

 Because it gives the reader the context as to why this is an important study? 

If there weren't a concerted effort to push a false narrative that warming stopped, then a study showing otherwise wouldn't have any relevance.  




 A scientist should hope that people stop saying something that's incorrect. 

Right? Or do you think they should be happy about misinformation and the repetition of debunked myths? 




 ...did you really just use the "it's cold where I am right now, therefore global warming isn't real" argument? 
 




 Yeah maybe just don't be a pedant. 

I work with climate scientists on a daily basis. They use the terms interchangeably unless referring to specific issues. 

And regardless, editors, not scientists, write headlines. 
 




 But then it appears as if someone's been quoted, not that it's just part of the article. Personal opinion isn't ever allowed, so I don't see why people would think it's that and not a quote from the story, which is standard practice... 




 Scientists shouldn't hope that false things aren't repeated?

 I don't know if it's true or not, but it might be. Better be careful or one of the Nazi mods might b  you! 




 I would respond with some stupid shitty response mocking the outrage about FPH's ban, but there's no way I could be ridiculous enough to out-shitty those people... 




 [Here's a pretty scathing rebuttal of Soon's most recent co-authored study.](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/jun/03/research-downplaying-impending-global-warming-is-overturned)  




 Lol I wish it were that easy! 




 I can't think of a single agency that doesn't use the term

That's the point! Southern Company isn't a common, public, or unbiased funding source. They're a company. Their motive isn't uncovering scientific truths, it's making money. (Yes, companies fund lots of perfectly good science. Clearly that is not the case here.) 

And it's not a "we're too stupid" defense, it's a "you're too smart" one. 




 Not to get into a whole thing here, but...uh...[remember Sandy](https://www.google.com/search?site= tbm=isch source=hp biw=1038 bih=893 q=Sandy+NYC+underwater oq=Sandy+NYC+underwater gs_l=img.3...5657.8552.0.8746.20.10.0.9.0.0.303.919.6j2j0j1.9.0....0...1ac.1.64.img..12.8.614.4MvcdDFQvN4)?

Because I do. In fact, I remember seeing the road in front of my apartment so flooded that when the waters finally receded, there was a ~10 lb Atlantic Cod flapping around on a sewer drain.   




 I get what you're saying, I'm not disagreeing. I'm telling you that you're expecting the media to operate as though they're publishing PhD's, and expecting the public to understand things like publishing PhD's. It's just unrealistic. 

The focus on the term is just a heuristic. No, it's not technically 100% accurate. No, it's not the key issue. *It's just a symbol that people can understand.* 

Having the slightest idea what you're reporting on

I hate to tell you, only the most experienced and educated reporters have any clue what they report on. If you'd like to change that, convince more PhDs to stop writing peer-reviewed studies and start writing for the public.

Something that most PhDs don't know and always have a hard time dealing with: mainstream media is written for an 8th grade reading level. 

Let that sink in. 8th grade. 

That's the standard you can to hold them to.  




 the use of the term 'deliverable' in no way implies such a relationship. 

I mean...it kind of does though, if the other option is that there's no relationship at all. It isn't inherently bad, but it does mean that the study was done on the company's behalf. Which means he's not independent, and he should declare the funding. 

What is the purpose of paying attention to their coverage, when they admittedly have absolutely no idea what they are doing?

Then don't. If you demand perfection you'll always be disappointed, and you can go ahead and stop doing anything outside the ivory tower.  




 [Make it happen people!](https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=sloths+are+slowbears)  




 A billion Catholics would beg to differ... 




 Yes. Wouldn't have helped the fact that they've been debunked, but it would at least make him honest.  




 I guess I should have added that he claims to be independent, but if it's a study for a company in exchange for funding, then it's not really independent. Right? 

I just think you're holding the public media to a higher standard than they're ever going to meet. You can't expect the public/media to understand the details of publishing. Of course it'd be nice if they followed science as closely as pop culture, but that's just unrealistic, you know?   




 For the most part whatever public institutions or private universities they work in...  




 Except Gore's not publishing studies without disclosing that funding. 

So you've inadvertently made the opposite point you tried to. This shows that Soon's not a scientist, he's an advocate.  




 I hear you, but that's kind of the point. The fact that he considers them deliverables but *failed to disclose that to the journals* is the problem. 

Though you're right, journalists/editors are going to use that term as a shorthand for the public.  




 Is there any indication his work is biased or fraudulent?

Yes. He's been debunked repeatedly by scientists who aren't being paid by fossil fuel companies.

 Oh not to worry, you got it!  




 /r/fatfishhate 




 "business as usual scenario" would not, it assumes a continuing reliance on fossil fuels. 

But some of them would, yes. They tend to do a range of emission scenarios, from no clean energy to mostly clean energy, to mostly clean energy and some carbon capture and sequestration, to all clean energy and carbon capture and sequestration.  




 lol, Daily Mail. I wouldn't be surprised if they started sourcing us for the "facts" in their "news"! 

(Also, keep submitting, these two were great!) 




 Umm...just to verify, you know the "shitty" in the sub name is because all of these facts are made up nonsense, right? Not a judgement of whether or not it's an amazing "fact"?

 [Present!](http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/01/the-20-best-martial-arts-movies-on-netflix-streami.html)

I DVR'd Bloodsport this weekend, gonna watch that tomorrow methinks... 




 You've seen Kung Fu Hustle, right?! If not, drop what you're doing, build a time machine, travel back far enough to find a Blockbuster, and rent Kung Fu Hustle.  




 Young Jackie Chan is the only person who's more entertaining a fighter. His Drunken Master is [great just by itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8Hf8l_TUaU), but a whole lot of fun to watch [in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74OBuMA2qEk).  




 Me too! Just the right amount of style to his fighting. 

Check your TV and see if you have the El Rey channel. It's a weird channel that's mostly kung fu movies and stuff from the 80s, but branded around Mexican wrestling because that's the only original programming it does. 




 Yus. This is my favorite one yet. Perfect! 

(Helps that I've seen the movie recently.) 




 Tell me about it! I went to Coney Island last Sunday and got a little burned after laying out for just a little bit. Then the next day I went to work without a sweater and about froze!  




 Yes, people who mine and burn the dirtiest fuels will need to find new jobs. Which, as the quote in the title points out, will be outnumbered at least 2 to 1 by the new jobs created. 
 




 More technically, it looks like a shortnose batfish, or Ogcocephalus nasutus.

No idea why that big nose is considered short, but I hope that helps! 




 I would if I could, but this is an old image I had in my imgur, that I probably pulled from Pinterest. 

TBH I only knew it was a batfish because I posted the image here 9 months ago with a different title... 




 Hey, if /u/foieymcfoie can get google to autofill a group of chameleons is a starship, I think I should be able to make slowbears a thing! 




 Really? Because last time I heard it, yomamma was so ugly I had to repress the memory! 




 It's not just for the sake of jobs, it's rebutting the industry talking point that regulations destroy jobs. 

Because yes, what you're referencing is the Broken Window fallacy, and it's not exactly good policy.  




 Oh yes, think of the gas companies! We would hate to put a dent in the profits of the richest companies in the world! Heaven forbid they earn anything less than a bazillion dollars for their product that's polluting the atmosphere!

Privatize profits and socialize losses, that's what I always say! Yay corporate socialism!  




 Right, because businesses just up and quit when the EPA regulated lead in gas. 

Businesses just up and quit when the Montreal Protocol phased out aerosols and coolants. 

Business just up and quit when we ended child labor. 

Oh wait, they didn't? And that's just the fearmongering every industry does every time there's a threat of regulation? Oh, hmm.  




 If Slowbears could get popular enough to catch on in google, 

I would be soooooo happy.  




 Batfish, which is actually pretty rare.  




 What's funny about the most recent point on a long-term trend line showing a clear forcing being relevant, while pointing to a short term fluctuation isn't? 

One's evidence of the continuation of a longer trend, the other isn't.

 Yes but was it propeller-powered? :P  




 Yeah that part confused me too. I'm guessing it's something to do with their personalities and the larger narrative of them "just" being farmers.  




 I hate ol' anal froth as much as the next guy, but this just makes me pity him. That's just sad.   




 It's got 3 hours of battery life, so unless it's a big-ass lake you should be alright! 






































































































































 Almost missed that crazy LSP! 




 I don't post climate/env stuff on the weekends because the newsletters don't go out on the weekends. Back when they went out, I posted on the weekends. (I think you can see that in my old posts in /r/CHART_BOT but it might've been before that so no guarantees.) 

And if the trackers included my activity in private (karmawhore-only) subreddits where you trolly fanboys can't follow me, things would look a bit different...

Anyway, I'm off to the mermaid parade now, since it's practically in my back yard. Have fun chasing archie around in circles!

 Please refrain from using colloquial names, as it can cause confusion. If you'd like, resubmit with either Dihydrogen Monoxide or 'hydroxyl acid' in the title instead.  




 lol, daily mail 




 Whereas when you look at any group disputing climate change, 100% of the funding is from fossil fuel groups or dark money, aka nonprofit money laundering for the Kochs. And good luck finding their funding info, because they sure don't make it as easy to find as AAAS. 

(And a note, that funding was only for the "What We Know" project, not the AAAS as a whole.)  




 Well if you want to take that path, then it should be pretty obvious-who is more likely to be right, and who is more likely to be bought off, the group that consists of 97% of the scientists in the field, who get public grants for research (meaning they don't get to pocket the money) and who are delivering a message no one wants to hear in peer-reviewed journals for the past 100 years, or the group of just 3%, who get private funding from fossil fuel companies (meaning they do get to pocket money) and are delivering a message that fossil fuel companies want to put out, and whose work rarely appears in peer-reviewed journals and when they do are quickly and thoroughly debunked. 

So you can either believe that nearly every single one the world's climate scientists at every legitimate institution and every university have been bought, or that a small handful of scientists with otherwise dead-end careers have been bought.

That said, I'd recommend you take a look at the science. There are a number of fairly straightforward explainers from what should be credible sources- The A[merican Association for the Advancement of Science](http://whatweknow.aaas.org/), the group that puts out the #1 peer-reviewed journal, Science and is one of the oldest and most prestigious academic institutions ever is a good place to start. Then there's the [National Climate Assessment](http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/), which uses information and scientists from the various government scientific agencies, and was started by Bush to explain the state of climate science.  Then [there's the IPCC](http://ipcc.ch/), which is the international look at the state of the science, and has been approved by delegates from every country (including petrostates like Saudi Arabia. So even Saudis agree that what's there is the truth.)

 lol, so you're blaming the fact that deniers circlejerk misleading Antarctic sea ice figures on the study authors. 

I bet deniers would also get questions about the rate of warming wrong. I also bet they'd get questions about how much warming is caused by man wrong too! 

But thanks for confirming that TP'ers/deniers come from a position of factual inaccuracy.

 Past studies (like both of your Kahan studies) look at general science literacy, this deals explicitly with climate science. Given that climate is the issue at hand, this one is clearly more relevant than Kahan.  




 Me either, that's why I posted coverage of a peer-reviewed paper.  




 Past studies like that one deal with general science literacy. This is specific to climate science, therefore much more relevant.

What's that you say? Just all the states that are going to want a sensible and proven way to to comply with the EPA's Clean Power Plan?!
