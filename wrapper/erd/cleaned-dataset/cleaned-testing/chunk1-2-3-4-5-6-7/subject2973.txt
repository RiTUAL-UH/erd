 I'm sure people who kill can not control their rage during the moment of the kill, unless you speak of sociopaths or psychopaths who enjoy that moment. During this moment of the kill murderer's do not care about what troubles they will run into in the future. 'Normal' murderers realize the ramifications only after their acts; this is why 'normal' murderers run away from the scene of the crime or attempt to dispose of the body and the evidence,  obviously not very well  since they are caught fairly 'fast' unlike serial killers whom are caught only after a spree. 

Allowing the victims family to deal with the murderer is a primitive idea, because who is to say that the murderer's family will not go and kill someone in the victim's family?  These codes /rules/ laws exist in real life. For example if you look at Albania they have this code called the kanun, which dictates punishment like this.  When someone is killed by someone else then someone from the victim's family must seek revenge to honor the dead. This goes on until the males of the family is wiped out. However people stopped following the Kanun and do things their own way! 

 Following rules like you propose in your comment is destructive towards society because their will be retaliatory killings amongst the victim's family and the murderer's family. The victim's family becomes the murderer to the eyes of of the original murderer's family and then this family becomes the victim.  Not only is the community affected emotionally but the economic ramifications far out weigh the benefits because their will be a lack of people to work and stimulate the economy as a whole. 

Even with strict rules to your proposition, the rules will not be an exegesis hence people will do as pleased. People will bend the rules and find loop holes.

 Joke 
























 People have said religion, but the problem goes far beyond the scope of religion. Its oppression, created by their leaders and social structure not Islam and economic disadvantage and the lack of education due to the lack of a good economy to support a knowledge base. 

People are drawn to ISIS because they believe that by joining ISIS they'll escape oppression in turn leading to a more comfortable live. THEY ARE SO WRONG. ISIS does everything that's against Islam. In Islam you'll go to hell for persecuting other religions, especially Christianity and Judaism, to which Islam shares so much with. One of the main Islamic celebrations is from God asking Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac which is in Christianity.  Also Muslims believe is Jesus.  So it makes no sense to persecute these "unbelievers". ISIS will survive by oppression. These ISIS members think they'll be free from their current tyrannical despots but they are just feeding another tyrannical despot. 

In Islam men and women are equal in any social structure. However, people will not know this unless they're educated, in the sense of religion and the regular schooling, SIS is not going to be willing to provide education that is free of censorship. These ISIS subjects will never know what real Islam is. The Islam they'll know is the version that best fits the needs of ISIS. 

Like the Al Qa'ida, they'll garner a bad reputation for the Muslims living abroad in the West (read reddit comments below for proof). They'll do this so the Westerners are racist and stereotypical towards the Muslims in turn the oppressed joins/ understands ISIS's cause. 

The best course of action for the Western countries is not only to bomb these fuckers, but to spread what the real Islam says via radio and TV broadcasts. I assure you that most of ISIS's members are uneducated and thus they are easily deceived by ISIS's Imams because they have always been told to trust like you would trust a man in an uniform than the guy with chinos and a t shirt on.

 Money isn't really the issue. The real issue is that we have lost the principles that America was founded upon. We have lost our right to privacy. We have laws like the patriot act where existing laws can be sidelined in the name of national security. Money can always be earned but our rights as citizens are gone-- possibly forever. All we can do now is make sure that those laws that violate the Principles which America was founded on gets repealed and that is the only way we can avenge the deaths of our soldiers who died to protect our freedom.
