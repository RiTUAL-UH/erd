 There will be no collapse.  AT least not in the way you imagine it.  It's not going to be like "Dawn of the Dead" where suddenly chaos erupts everywhere, and the preppers grab their bugout bags and go in the woods.  The ongoing zeitgeist that one day lightning will strike and the proles will rise up is another method of control.  It's far more insidious than that.  Read "The Hollow Men" by TS Eliot and you'll understand.

You'll just notice that every day things will become a little more expensive.  Prices will go up and down, but this constant will always remain: you will need to work longer for less and less.  Young people finishing college will be told at their graduation that "The only way to the top is to start at the bottom," only to see the bottom get lower and lower every year.  Job security will cease to exist as a concept.  YOu'll notice the size of houses and apartments will begin to shrink whilst the price of housing rises.  More and more it will become challenging to find food that doesn't taste rather bland.  You'll see your friends and family less, and one day find that doesn't bother you much.  Marriage will become rare, as will children.  People will begin to indulge themselves in digital fantasies, never actually experiencing the real world.  The modern human will have no religion.  No dreams.  No desires or wants beyond the immediate sating of his bodily desires.  No beliefs beyond the arithmetic (and even that will become a grey area).  One day, still many generations from now, your descendant will walk into a voting booth, and there will be a single choice for him to checK: "Yes."  And every day he will be told from the moment he wakes up to the moment he sleeps, "You are stupid, you are ugly, you are weak.  But together we are free, prosperous, and strong."

That is the true nature of the collapse: the reduction of the modern American man to a feudal serf, incapable of feeling love or hate, and unable to recognize his own self-worth.

 Has this been in planning since Obama was elected?  Just recently there has been a huge political push to overthrow the United States government by its own members, and high ranking members of other nations. Obama has "failed" the military industrial complex by recalling troops from the Middle East and by not sending in troops during the "Syria chemical weapons" debacle, and Obama has "failed" Israel by not being more firm with Iran. Saudi Arabia is at risk of being exposed as a direct financial supporter of the 9/11 attacks, and Rand Paul had a speech about how Saudi Arabia is no longer an ally of the United States.

Netanyahu has been working directly with members of the US congress in an effort to overthrow Obama. 
http://nypost.com/2015/02/18/bibi-why-im-speaking-to-congress/

"Why am I going to Washington? Because, as prime minister of Israel, its my obligation to do everything in my power to prevent the conclusion of a bad deal that could threaten the survival of the State of Israel. "

This means that Netanyahu doesn't believe Obama is working in the best interest of Israel, so he's working directly with members of congress to ensure that something happens to change that fact.

Rudy Giuliani, who was in on the 9/11 attacks, has directly attacked Obama

Rudy Giuliani: Obama doesn't love America

Giuliani, a lapdog, has been making a big scene about Obama. Conservatives love Giuliani and believe everything he says. 

Giuliani states that Obama was influenced by Communists
http://nypost.com/2015/02/21/giuliani-obama-influenced-by-communists-since-youth/

Rudy Giuliani doubled down on his claims that President Obama doesnt love America in an interview with The Post Friday  claiming the commander-in-chief has been influenced by communists since his youth.

DHS intelligence report warns of domestic right-wing terror threat 
http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/19/politics/terror-threat-homeland-security/

They're carrying out sporadic terror attacks on police, have threatened attacks on government buildings and reject government authority.

The DHS was given unlimited power after the events of 9/11. Saudi Arabia has been linked with al-Qaida and the American public wants the "missing" 28 pages of the 9/11 commission reports to be declassified. Netanyahu has stated that 9/11 was very beneficial to Israel. These entities are trying to overthrow Obama and take control of America. Expect a false flag attack in the coming weeks, if not sooner. Afterwards the DHS will launch their plan to incarcerate any that oppose the coup.

 Maybe.  We still don't have her story.  




 What evidence do you have that the son will live a better life in China? 




 They will, eventually.  She won't be able to stay long. 




 She's not a Chinese citizen.  She was born there, but is now a US citizen.  She can't legally stay in China much longer. 




 Massachusetts will give you $2,500 cash back if you buy an electric 




 My son does a lot of small business with companies in Dalian.  He says many people speak English there and it wouldn't be too hard to find this woman

AMHERST  The University of Massachusetts Amherst is in discussions with the Dalai Lama to have him speak at the university this fall.

Nancy Buffone, the universitys executive director of external relations and university events, said the university was in planning mode.

Were expecting a visit in the fall, thats all I can say right now, Buffone said Thursday. Were in very intense planning.

The details of his appearance at UMass are still being worked out.

The Dalai Lama, Tibetans exiled spiritual leader, last came to the region on May 9, 2007, to speak at Smith College and receive an honorary doctorate from that institution.

He was welcomed that day by both Hampshire and Smith colleges. The Five Colleges run an exchange program with the Tibetan universities in exile in India. The Dalai Lama also spoke privately with members of the Tibetan Association of Western Massachusetts.

With a good education, facilities and warm-heartedness, a person becomes fuller and, I think, better equipped to face problems, he said to a group of thousands at Smith. Education gives us guidance, and warm-heartedness gives us the proper use of all our knowledge.

Constance Kassor, a lecturer in the religion department at Smith and the current director of the Five College Tibetan Studies in India exchange program, said she is pleased the Dalai Lama will likely return to the Valley.

Its a really exciting opportunity, especially for our students, Kassor said Thursday.

Some students who have participated in the exchange program have gotten to meet the Dalai Lama and have a private audience with him, Kassor said.

Anna Lee White, a senior at Mount Holyoke College, participated in the program in January 2013. During her stay in northern India, the Dalai Lama visited the university for a week to give public teachings, she said.

It was incredible to attend these teachings along with thousands of Tibetans, White wrote in an email to the Gazette.

During her groups private meeting with the Dalai Lama, White remembers how many groups were waiting to see him, but how calm, friendly and curious he was with everyone he spoke with.

The group before them were all blind Indian children, and he gave each of them a hug before saying goodbye, White wrote.

I remember him telling all of us that he hopes that someday we would have the chance to travel to Tibet and continue learning about Buddhism and see what it is like there ourselves, she wrote.

The experience led her to return to India the following year for a semester and she will be studying Hindi in India next year after graduating in May.

She will miss the Dalai Lamas visit, but hopes to hear about it from her sister, who attends Amherst College, she said.

Elena Read, a senior at Smith, also participated in the exchange program in 2013.

She said the Dalai Lamas teaching sessions stuck with her more than the private visit with him.

Much of the teaching focused on death, and living with the awareness that one day each person will die, she said.

The only certainty in life is that it comes to an end, Read said. And so to kind of not waste time, I think that stuck with me pretty strongly.

Tibetans believe that the Dalai Lama is the reincarnated being of the Buddhist patron saint of Tibet, known as the Bodhisattva of Compassion, according to the Dalai Lamas website. Bodhisattvas are beings who have chosen to become reincarnated rather than achieve nirvana so that they can serve humanity, according to the website.

Born on July 6, 1935, in northeastern Tibet, the Dalai Lama began education as a Buddhist monk at age 6.

In 1950, the Dalai Lama was called upon to lead Tibet in the face of a Chinese invasion. He went to Beijing for peace talks with Mao Zedong and other Chinese leaders 1954, but was forced into exile in 1959 and has lived in Dharamsala in northern India ever since.

The Dalai Lama has spoken to the United Nations and governments of the United States and Europe, seeking for Tibet the status of an independent nation and a place of peace. He has advocated for non-violence.

He has traveled to nearly 70 countries on six continents and received more than 150 awards including, in 1989, the Nobel Peace Prize. He has also written or co-written more than 100 books.

While the Dalai Lama continues to be the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people, he is no longer the political leader, having transferred that authority to a democratically elected leader in 2011.

 That guy was pretty lame.  Remember each speaker is invited by the voters of that graduating class, speaks to the quality of the class vote 














 of course this is how it starts.  Look up James Corbett's "How to fake an Alien Invasion" 









 It pisses me off when my grandson's teacher talks about her church in class, but there's really nothing I can do about it.  As long as she's not preaching or praying, that is. 




 For about 15 years, my wife and I donated $500 to the western Mass food bank, so whenever I would see homeless people on the street, I'd convince myself that I'd already done my part.  While I still think donating to the food bank is a good thing, I've changed my thoughts on what to do when I encounter someone on the street.  I now give them whatever cash and loose change I have in my pockets.  Sometimes it's only a couple bucks, sometimes it's a few hundred.  I'm always going to be better off than them, so why not share what I have?  Honestly I don't care where the money goes, and I'm done with judging people on the choices they've made in their lives. 




 I work in an ER.  We see a few of these "cases" a couple times a year.  All of the patients have a history of heroin use. 









 Unfortunately, it's not.  I can't post there 




 OP how do you have so much time to devote to posts like this?  I mean, who the FUCK CARES? 




 Fuckers should donate that money to their own people north of the border.  Fucking koreans 




 Yeah Weebly is great.  Wicked easy to use also has great mobile 









 Dahboo is a moron.  Fuck daboo 




 There's always Fark.com 




 obviously the one with the demon face 




 The mods of course. 

But that's ok because we have /r/Bad_cop_no_donut  









 Didn't Paul play football in college?  That may explain the obvious brain trauma and memory loss  














 I like it "unspecified New England town"  




 Staples on Rte 9 in Amherst will do it for you.  Email them to the copy center through their website, or call and get the email from their copy center.  Then you can pick up at your leisure. 














 Oh sure, I get that, totally!  And that's a great thing.  Scientology is clearly a scam and the movie clearly delineates that in great detail, and does it well.  It's just a shame they didn't dig deeper, into the murders and other conspiracies 









 Thanks for posting that.  I watched the first 30 minutes of it before turning it off.  As I said earlier, none of this is new.   




 I've heard it's not very good, that the book is better and that there's nothing new revealed about the church that isn't already online 




 No thanks, NSA 




 Let us know how it goes.  I'm not really interested 




 There are a lot of cool places where poetry is often part of the "scene" for example the Thirsty Mind coffee house in South Hadley 









 Well an RSS reader like Google Reader is what I'm looking for.  Something that I can share to and can be shared/discussed 




 it's an aggragator, no more no less.  You have to be able to read between the lines.  There are very few journalists/researchers I trust.  James Corbett is one of them.  His agenda seems to be fairly open, although I did wonder at the fact that he took a very long time to open up about his personal history/timeline.   









 You posted this in Northampton too right?  As I said over there, there's not much to do in Amherst except you do have the Fretted Instrument Workshop here which is pretty great.

If you're a hiker you'll want to check out the Metacomet Monadnock trail which is nearby, also the Robert Frost Trails.

Speaking of Frost, there's a museum for him at Amherst College

And if you're really into writers, how about the Emily Dickinson museum on Main St? 




 Has nothing to do with belief.   




 I've been watching episodes of "the Wire"...sheeit 




 I think the bulb show is still going on at Smith College greenhouse.  Worth checking out.

Thornes Market is fun.  We take our grandkids there.

Just walk up one side of Main St and down the other.  There're lots of cool shops to check out.  

Head over to Downtown Sounds on Pleasant St and check out the instruments for sale there.

If you're into music, Turn It Up has used CD, also on Pleasant St.  

A2Z is a hobby/toy store on King St if you have kids that's a fun place to visit. 

A couple nice galleries in Noho.

Amherst doesn't have much to see for tourists.  There are a couple book stores, but the selection isn't great.  I guess the thing I like about Amherst most is the Fretted Instrument Workshop, a great music store with guitars and mandolins and banjos.

 




 Why?  A boat on the water?  An over exposed/filtered picture of trees and water?  I'm confused. 




 Nor can you, Mr Panetta 




 The Birds, The Birds!  Like something out of a Hitchcock movie 




 she's ugly.  WTF.  Guys, you can install big tits on a tin can if you want.  It's the face that matters 




 You're talking about Meta Data, which they've been pulling for years.  Ever watch "The Wire"?

But downloading anything from Wikileaks will get you automatically flagged at the NSA and Department of Homeland Security. 




 I'm not here for numbers.  I'm here to learn something and share a little of what I've learned.  I'm here for a laugh and here for a little fun.  If I can't vote, I'm not going to waste my time on a site.  It's why I stopped going to GLP (I originally went for a laugh, that site is a joke), they started banning any IP that didn't log in.  It became a chore to go there so I stopped.  

As I said, I don't give a shit about Karma.  I just like to learn and share. 




 The VNW was publicized.  Americans saw gruesome battles on tv every evening while they ate their dinner!  The KW was a hidden "police action", largely overlooked by the MSM at the time 














 Clickbait.  If you click on it you will be tracked by the NSA and DHS. 




  Can't download it as it's bigger than a gb.  Post it somewhere so we can watch it online 




 Easy for me, but I'm older than you guys by probably about 40 years LOL 




 "Famous Dutch Band" Isn't that an oxymoron?   




 I guess I use Reddit like an RSS reader.  The only way you can hide something is by voting on it.  But I like the variety of articles on the front page.  It's still my go to site for "pNews" because it's way faster than inoreader or any other rss reader 




 Generally I say what's on my mind and don't give a fuck about comment karma (which is why you see so many -'s next to my comments here on spReddit.  I just don't give a fuck.  I used to care about that shit like 5 or 6 years ago when it really did matter.  But now?  It doesn't matter one iota 




 Democracy now has it listed on their website.  You can read it without alerting NSA there 




 Wow might as well share some fat samoans then.  They are technically asians.  How about Mexicans and Pygmies?  Same genetic code as Chinese.

Indians are not asian 




 wrong kind of asian bub 




 Warning...it's a PDF and will download automatically, notifying the NSA automatically that you're a terrorist 




 Do you remember Richard "Dick" Walton from the B school? 









 THis person is not attractive.  Stop posting 




 clipons/boltons are really ugly.  they serve literally no purpose.  I work in an ER.  Have you ever seen one of these that's been in an auto accident?  Yuk 




 I don't see it.  Honestly I don't, I'm not trying to be a troll.  Business is booming in Massachusetts 









 wow three whole people! 




 It happens all the time.  Training that is 




 What about Iraq? 














 I'm from western Massachusetts and I see airplanes go over head every day 




 OP do you know how government agencies get money for their budgets?  By spending every penny they have!  I worked for the city of Boston in the 1970s.  You could tell a government worker because they would push all of the paper, delay as long as it was legally possible and "hide" whenever they could.  Government workers take the maximum # of breaks that exist, take all of their vacation, and sick time, and know every loophole that exists to keep from helping you or doing their job!

So I'm not surprised to read your story, and I'm positive there's no conspiracy here 




 It won't affect me much as I rarely read MSM anyway 




 The biggest problem with Voat is you can't vote! (until you have 100 comment karma) 




 Fuck the popups on that site.  What the fuck.   




 OP you should know better than try to post a conspiracy thread in worldnews or news 




 Is it true that atheists must be executed in Syria?

Is there a law against atheism in Iraq? 









 I'm moving to Canada.  No I'm too old.  Shit 




 boobs and tats are a dime a dozen.  Let's see her face! 









 Manami Hashimoto 









 Doesn't her face look disproportionately small compared to the rest of her body? 




 If you're an American, you're used to seeing big boobs.  But look at those eyes!  That's what I love most about Asian models...eyes, cheekbones, etc. 




 don't be that guy! 




 Fake tits and eye surgery = White American.  Not interested 









 I don't think there's a conspiracy here...Sure it makes sense to put your rant in /r/conspiracy because there are fewer rules here than the rest of Reddit and the mods are generally great guys.  There's a shitload more "democracy" in this subreddit than the rest of the site!

But what I'm saying is, this is just one of the swings of the site...it's going way to the right now and will probably go this way for a couple more years before it swings back the other way.  I should know, I was here when it first started...I learned about it from a FARK link for chrissakes, back when Mike Arrington had just started Techcrunch as a blog...do you guys remember when there was a forum on that site?  With conversations about startups and great new social media sites.  Those were the days!

Reddit used to be this tiny FARK imitation site where you could vote, share and discuss any fucking thing you wanted without moderation, kinda like 4chan, but with a better setup.

I guess some of us are waiting for the next thing, but for right now, we got /r/conspiracy and that's good enough for most of us :) 




 Are you saying Aaron Schwartz was killed by reddit? 









 hitomi furuya 




 It's an obvious and poorly done photoshop.  If you enlarge the image and look at the arm on the left, it's distorted.

 




 Won't be the first time 




 Camera bag?  Some kind of padded equipment bag 









 As someone who actually went to Vietnam (as a medic), that's an obvious photoshop 









 I'm an atheist and an MD.  I took a minor in religion during College because I was curious.

 The Slaves That Time Forgot

John Martin
Global Research
May 29, 2012

They came as slaves; vast human cargo transported on tall British ships bound for the Americas. They were shipped by the hundreds of thousands and included men, women, and even the youngest of children.

Whenever they rebelled or even disobeyed an order, they were punished in the harshest ways. Slave owners would hang their human property by their hands and set their hands or feet on fire as one form of punishment. They were burned alive and had their heads placed on pikes in the marketplace as a warning to other captives.

We dont really need to go through all of the gory details, do we? After all, we know all too well the atrocities of the African slave trade. But, are we talking about African slavery? King James II and Charles I led a continued effort to enslave the Irish. Britains famed Oliver Cromwell furthered this practice of dehumanizing ones next door neighbor.

The Irish slave trade began when James II sold 30,000 Irish prisoners as slaves to the New World. His Proclamation of 1625 required Irish political prisoners be sent overseas and sold to English settlers in the West Indies. By the mid 1600s, the Irish were the main slaves sold to Antigua and Montserrat. At that time, 70% of the total population of Montserrat were Irish slaves.

Ireland quickly became the biggest source of human livestock for English merchants. The majority of the early slaves to the New World were actually white.

From 1641 to 1652, over 500,000 Irish were killed by the English and another 300,000 were sold as slaves. Irelands population fell from about 1,500,000 to 600,000 in one single decade. Families were ripped apart as the British did not allow Irish dads to take their wives and children with them across the Atlantic. This led to a helpless population of homeless women and children. Britains solution was to auction them off as well.

During the 1650s, over 100,000 Irish children between the ages of 10 and 14 were taken from their parents and sold as slaves in the West Indies, Virginia and New England. In this decade, 52,000 Irish (mostly women and children) were sold to Barbados and Virginia. Another 30,000 Irish men and women were also transported and sold to the highest bidder. In 1656, Cromwell ordered that 2000 Irish children be taken to Jamaica and sold as slaves to English settlers.

Many people today will avoid calling the Irish slaves what they truly were: Slaves. Theyll come up with terms like Indentured Servants to describe what occurred to the Irish. However, in most cases from the 17th and 18th centuries, Irish slaves were nothing more than human cattle.

As an example, the African slave trade was just beginning during this same period. It is well recorded that African slaves, not tainted with the stain of the hated Catholic theology and more expensive to purchase, were often treated far better than their Irish counterparts.

African slaves were very expensive during the late 1600s (50 Sterling). Irish slaves came cheap (no more than 5 Sterling). If a planter whipped or branded or beat an Irish slave to death, it was never a crime. A death was a monetary setback, but far cheaper than killing a more expensive African. The English masters quickly began breeding the Irish women for both their own personal pleasure and for greater profit. Children of slaves were themselves slaves, which increased the size of the masters free workforce. Even if an Irish woman somehow obtained her freedom, her kids would remain slaves of her master. Thus, Irish moms, even with this new found emancipation, would seldom abandon their kids and would remain in servitude.

In time, the English thought of a better way to use these women (in many cases, girls as young as 12) to increase their market share: The settlers began to breed Irish women and girls with African men to produce slaves with a distinct complexion. These new mulatto slaves brought a higher price than Irish livestock and, likewise, enabled the settlers to save money rather than purchase new African slaves. This practice of interbreeding Irish females with African men went on for several decades and was so widespread that, in 1681, legislation was passed forbidding the practice of mating Irish slave women to African slave men for the purpose of producing slaves for sale. In short, it was stopped only because it interfered with the profits of a large slave transport company.

England continued to ship tens of thousands of Irish slaves for more than a century. Records state that, after the 1798 Irish Rebellion, thousands of Irish slaves were sold to both America and Australia. There were horrible abuses of both African and Irish captives. One British ship even dumped 1,302 slaves into the Atlantic Ocean so that the crew would have plenty of food to eat.

There is little question that the Irish experienced the horrors of slavery as much (if not more in the 17th Century) as the Africans did. There is, also, very little question that those brown, tanned faces you witness in your travels to the West Indies are very likely a combination of African and Irish ancestry. In 1839, Britain finally decided on its own to end its participation in Satans highway to hell and stopped transporting slaves. While their decision did not stop pirates from doing what they desired, the new law slowly concluded THIS chapter of nightmarish Irish misery.

But, if anyone, black or white, believes that slavery was only an African experience, then theyve got it completely wrong.

Irish slavery is a subject worth remembering, not erasing from our memories.

But, where are our public (and PRIVATE) schools???? Where are the history books? Why is it so seldom discussed?

Do the memories of hundreds of thousands of Irish victims merit more than a mention from an unknown writer?

Or is their story to be one that their English pirates intended: To (unlike the African book) have the Irish story utterly and completely disappear as if it never happened.

The man facing down Putin's aggression as secretary of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council is Andriy Parubiy. He oversees national security for the nation having previously served as security commandant during the anti-government protests in Kiev.

Parubiy was the founder of the Social National Party of Ukraine, a fascist party styled on Hitler's Nazis, with membership restricted to ethnic Ukrainians.

Its kind of strange, because in the last five days of the bombing and shelling, we havent seen a single militia compound that has actually been hit. Every building that weve seen been hit by the Ukrainian mortars have been civilian buildings. We personally seen at least over 40 different civilian buildings bombed, that includes a school, an orphanage  we were in an orphanage the day before yesterday that was hit  and the very many large apartment buildings, like the very big apartment buildings have been hit . Some of the apartment buildings  its not like the Ukrainian army miss-aimed or something like this  the same buildings when they are bombed, they hit them very hard. We spoke to one woman who said that in the night a few days ago her apartment building was hit with ten different mortars.

 OP what nationality is she?  Curious because of the shape of her nose.  




 the problem with gfycat.com is it's not mobile-friendly, in other words, if you access reddit from your mobile, you can't load these images

 It depends on where you live.  You can often get all of that included if you live in Sunderland or Belchertown.  Apartments in Amherst and Northampton are much much more expensive and utilities are often NOT included

 yeah can't find much in the video database for her yet... 




 ooooo InfoLiars.com!  so it must be true! 














 My wife and I own a house and some land in Amherst, MA.  We've lived here since the 1960s.  We love it.  It's racially diverse (I'm white an my wife is Korean), a great place to have a family and grow up (my kids stayed in Amherst and they have their own kids now).

I'm 63, I'll retire in a couple years.  My wife and I have talked about moving to someplace warmer because it's so frikking cold here in the winter.  This last winter was especially bad.  But all of our family are here and it would be a burden to them for us to move away, so I think we'll stay.  Besides, we have a huge house and lots of land.  My wife is an avid organic gardener and we have fruit trees, berry bushes and several gardens.  I'd hate to give that up.

I can't speak about small business ownership.  I work at a couple of the local hospitals which have their issues in management, but overall are excellent.

Like I said, I've owned property in Amherst since it was cheap.  It's very expensive now, but you can find more affordable real estate in Belchertown, which is not too far from here, or South Hadley which is a bit farther, but also a very nice place to live (my youngest daughter lives there with her girlfriend - yes it's gay friendly).

Hope it helps

 Keep your hand off the instrument.  Relax your wrist.  Angle the pick to the side (not the point).  Start slowly and work up to a fast tempo over time using a metronome - quarter notes, 8th notes, 16th notes, 32nd notes, etc. 




 But if you've ever worked in food service, you know there is sexual harassment.  Wherever there are immigrants that don't speak English, you'll find it.

 I took HTML and Microsoft Office there in the 1980s.  It was pretty good then.  I know a lot of the people that work there now.  It's quite respectable.  A few UMass Amherst professors also teach there.

 That was a little harsh. Why do I sense anger?

 Something like guitar hero, but with a full band instead of one instrument, and not a contest, but a jam session.  It would be an online game where you could play music with people from all over the world.

 1.  Get a good mandolin teacher

2.  Make sure he/she is a mandolin player, not a guitarist that can "pick a few tunes" - you want someone that plays and teaches mandolin

3.  Learn to read music.  Sure you can learn tab too, but if you're going to play with others, music is the best form to use

4.  Find a teacher that also leads a good mandolin group so you can learn to play the instrument, and play in a group setting

 I never really got into the comments or discussion except here on /r/conspiracy and /r/korea my two favorite subreddits.  The reason for that is it's so anonymous.

 I too came to the mandolin from the violin after 18 years of classical training.  The pick did take me many years to learn.  My advice is to practice a variety of picking patterns with scales.  Also the Kreutzer violin etudes are very helpful for learning how to pick. 




 Rogue hands down.  Amazon.com often has it at $45 and free shipping with a prime membership 




 Yeah, unlike a violin which has a bass bar under the G string, most cheap mandolins are made without any additional tone bars, so converting it for left handed use should be no problem. 




 It's worth taking it to a mandolin shop/luthier.  If it is a Vega (Boston) or Gibson, you may have a collector's item worth something

You can't have heroin without poppies.  Sure you make make similar drugs in the laboratory, but they are very expensive and require government subsidies to support production and distribution.

Would it make sense to go to the places where poppies are grown and destroy the farms that grow them?  That or regulate their production and sale?

 Oh lookie!  Gloat is at it again! 









 It's pathetic.  You'd think they would come up with something more interesting to say 














 asshole 




 I hope they ban you.  Not only are you a moron, but you're an english one too 




 The anti-vaxxers are everywhere 














 fuck you and the horse you rode in on 




 um, I was?  leaving this shitty subreddit anyway 




 because it's a challenge for wow veterans 









 There's nothing new in wow actually. 




 Hmm...I'd say there's a lot of skill involved as you can't take advantage of gear.  You have to rely on your wits and your skill. 




 mocking you for being a moron.  you probably believe in the rapture also 




 Not in my state. 




 I'm not a paid poster 




 I'm not interested in mounts, gear or "treasure".  I'm motivated by leveling perks and gold.

Once you hit 100, there's nothing more to do except farm/auction which is really boring

I can't tell you how many times I've hit 100, deleted my toon and started over. 




 I honestly don't care about flying vs no-flying.  WOD is no more exciting than any other part of WOW.  And there is plenty of flying elsewhere.  Sure it would make it easier to do everything, but then that's cheating really.

Here's a challenge for you: try to level a toon without special armor or magic items to 100!

Do it now 




 My supervisor?  Not sure what you're referring to.  Anyway, I live and work in Massachusetts.  Vaccinations are required by law for public space use and schools.

I'm sorry you don't have kids.  They change everything, especially perspective! 




 Because she's hot? 




 As a doctor and a medic, if you don't vaccinate your children you are doing more harm than good. 




 So you're saying that what Israel did before is not the past now?  Doesn't make sense.

Anyway what do you care what Israel is doing? 




 Why would you post something like this on TIL?  It's obviously not confirmed by anyone or anything, so it goes against the rules of that subreddit 




 Dunno...something like this I suppose http://www.schs.ws/schs2/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/map_native_american.gif 




 Whale watching or go to the beach and walk the length of it (can take several hours - bring a knapsack for things you collect and some water).

Mass Audubon also has a reservation in Wellfleet that's pretty awesome...nice trails for hiking, a boardwalk, also a beach area.

Not a lot of "shopping" to do per se, unless you're into cheap knicknacks you can buy just about anywhere

 I played with my youngest daughter for the last 7 years.  She's married and has a 2 year old now.  I suppose I'm paying the monthly fee in case she wants to come back.

I also roll new toons once a month or so, run them up to 100 and delete them...it relaxes me 




 This morning I rolled a priest.  I'm at level 35 today.  I'm playing him naked, greeding on everything and selling.  So far, I've made 321 gold 




 Only race bait if I were baiting my own race which is kind of silly 




 My eldest son works for the commonwealth of Mass. as a civil engineer.  He said that most people are corrupt, inept and dishonest.  He said people just want to pull a pay check and go home to their video games and beer.

There's no conspiracy.  It's just that most people are lazy and self centered.  Most of the "evil" in the world is either someone being lazy (or a bunch of people institutionally lazy), or corrupt/self-centered. 




 They are fixing this in the patch.  No flying for you! 




 Psyop.  None of this is true.  it doesn't even depend on where you live any more.  The reason we're hearing more stories about bad things happening around the world is because the internet is becoming more available than ever before...that's a good thing. 




 I am half black and half mexican, so I think I can post whatever I want.  

Also, I see these people in the ER every day.  They have free insurance, are uneducated and keep coming back time after time for silly things like cuts, bruises, headaches, sniffles... 




 GLOAT, BLOAT, MOAT, STOAT,  














 What information did I post that was false?  You have to have 100 comment karma before you can vote.  That is true. 




 And the follow up: http://www.amren.com/ar/pdfs/2009/200907ar.pdf 














 There are other discussion forums online where you don't have to have karma to participate.  I just don't see the point of Voat if it's only there to compete with Reddit 




 I figured that much.  I enjoy reading your posts, though.  Please let me know when your book comes out.  You do sound a lot like Robert Steele.  I know you're not him.  I suspect you're a lot younger, possibly 1/3 of his age even.   









 Give the folks at Arcadia a call...I'm sure they will know better than anyone 




 I think these changes have been made to attract the new kind of player we're getting lately, which seems to care more about "items/gear" than game play.  I think Blizz is not catering to you and the way you play any more.  They see that this new generation of players is willing to shell out $30-$60 for items in addition to paying a monthly fee.  It's the new cash cow for Blizz.  They'll be including items in Diablo next if they haven't already.

 I've read all of your comments and submissions and you don't support any of your (wild) claims with evidence or references.  Care to explain why? 




 because it made me shudder looking at it?  I get that feeling you get when you rub an eraser on something smooth like glass...druuh druuh druuh 




 Do you have evidence or proof of any of this, or are you just making shit up? 




 Reddit is not run by an evil corporation.  It's run by [Conde Nast](https://www.condenast.com/).  They own Wired among other publications.  Hardly evil. 




 Hardly.  It's just becoming more and more corporate.  Not dying at all 




 You're talking shit.  You can say anything you want on reddit.   




 You can say anything you want on reddit.  Just create your own subreddit and say away!

 Voat is useless.  "You can't vote on Voat".  I call it "Gloat" because once anybody has something evil to say about Reddit, then everybody talks about "voat" like it's some special place.  It's not.  You have to have 100 "comment karma" before you can vote.  And that's only one of the reasons why I won't use it. 




 When is all this doom supposed to happen?  And I thought you were leaving the country? 














 The nutrage lady embarrassed her family and the company, a lot of Koreans felt embarrassed also.  My wife of 29 years did not feel this woman represents Koreans in any way.  She said this kind of attitude is not how Korean women behave and should not be taken that way.

Sending her to prison for a temper tantrum was pretty silly.  









 honestly if you care so much about the way reddit used to be, why don't you create your own site and invite people to join it?  I'll join.  Just don't create some arbitrary rules limiting use of the site like GLOAT did 



















 Obviously we're in the minority.  I feel this man is full of shit and as bad as any of the others

 That that wow is so fucking boring, I've becoming a troll tank.  It's a lot more fun than I thought.  I que as a paladin tank, then create huge pulls whilst shielded.  Then when everybody wipes, I release and stand at the entrance until they kick me. 




 I remember hours of fun porting people in using my warlock.  Now that spell is useless 









 Nothing new here.  If you're into this stuff, check out Bishop Accountability http://bishopaccountability.org 




 Happy to see my senators stayed away from this (MA) 




 I don't like raids (too many people running around, no leaders, no fun) and don't see the point of achievements 




 It used to be fun to quest and do dungeon runs.  Now it's super easy to quest, the loot is mediocre and the more advanced levels only have a few dungeons.

Also, part of the fun was getting to the dungeon.  Now you can just port in, do the dungeon, and get out.  Random dungeons don't have any teamwork any more.  In fact, the tank is usually ignored by dps and often not healed any more. 

Well, I guess it's a new game.  2006 was what, 9 years ago?  There's a new generation of players now and they're not the same...don't have the same gaming ethic. 




 I listen to it because it's the only talk radio station in my area that comes through clearly on my car radio.  I think it's entertaining, sort of.  The ads crack me up.  One time they had a psychic on and were asking her questions like "can you find my wallet" and shit like that 




 I listen to him.  I think he's a joke, thus entertaining. 




 Welp, I've been playing since 2006.  I used to play with my daughter, who has moved on to Elder Scrolls.  We used to quest together and it was fun.  I never got into raiding or heirlooms or anything like that.   




 Because it really sucks right now 









 um, who the fuck cares?  reddit never was anything more than a news aggragator

 I think he's Robert Steele.  Their writing style is identical 




 Tried it...maybe my computer's too slow?  I found it very annoying 




 WOW has gotten cringeworthy - the lowby levels (below 70) are easy-peasey, so children are playing them.  And, yeah, they act like children.  The upper levels (70+ are yawn-inspiring.  5 dungeons per area, the quests are annoying and the loot is insipid).  Honestly don't know why I bother playing that game any more.

Guild Wars 2 is slightly better, but you can't explore the unlocked regions, there are no boats to explore the seas, and there are no mounts, so if you're into exploring, as I am, you're SOOL

 




 Where's Robert Steele when you need him? 




 Wha was the story he was working on? 




 So what?  Who the fuck cares? 









 You write like Robert Steele. Are you sure you're not him? 




 Robert Steele LOL 




 fake tits are fake 




 You sure it has nothing to do with their tiny dicks? 














 I'm too old.  I really don't care.  I've got 2 more years till retirement, then I don't plan on living much past my 80th birthday, which is in about 17 years or so...

Regardless of what has been said here, and elsewhere, I live in one of the richest parts of the country (Massachusetts) and I don't see any of this "element" discussed here near where I live.  We are quite prosperous, thank you.  And I have the grandchildren to prove it! 




 Robert, is that you?

 I ignored temptation to try drugs in high school and graduated top of my class.  Was drafted to fight in Vietnam War.  Went as a medic, went to medical school up on completion of tour.

 Everyone here is going to talk about the seasons/weather, so I will just say get ready for traffic.  You said Lowell, which is a former mill town north west of Boston.  There's a University there and a couple community colleges holding the city together IMHO.  Not much of a nightlife unless you call banging down bud lights with your bros until 2 in the morning a nightlife.  Sure there are concerts and whatnot like any city.  I guess you just have to move here and check out the scene.  But be prepared for poverty, drug use (especially heroin), a lot of crime.

 You should read "Lennon" the biography of John Lennon.  He couldn't read music either.  But he wrote some of the most important rock tunes of the history of music.  His first instrument was the 5 string banjo.  A lot of people don't know that.  His mom played one.  He always wanted a guitar, but both his mom and his Aunt forbade him from becoming a musician because of his loser dad (a professional cruise ship musician).

 It's slow, but it works.  Every time.  

You've probably heard about one of our great musical historians, Chief O'Neil of Chicago.  Right?  He was an incredible dude.  Seriously.  He couldn't read music, but he remembered melodies by "rehearsing" them over and over in his head like you or I "rehearse" addresses or telephone numbers.  He would follow people around on street cars in the city, listen to the tunes they were singing or humming and go back to his office where a colleague who could write music wrote them down.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_O'Neill 














 hum the song, find the note using your finger on the fretboard and work from there.  that's how I do it, that's how most people do it.  a lot of composers use that method on the piano also

 PAO comes from the chinese name Bao

Last name origins   meanings:

Chinese: there are three different surnames that are Romanized in pinyin as Bao. Other Romanizations include Bau, Pao, and Pau.
Chinese:  this character also means abalone, but the name comes from an old place name. The area of Bao was granted to a chief counselor of the state of Qi during the Spring and Autumn period (722481 bc). His son took the place name as his surname and was called Bao Shuya. Bao Shuya was famous for his lofty moral character and was skilled at delegating authority, eventually becoming the first Chief King of the Spring and Autumn period.

Chinese:  this Chinese character means to wrap or package. The name is derived from the name of Shen Baoxu. Shen Baoxu was a senior official who lived 2500 years ago in the state of Chu. When the state of Chu was attacked by the state of Wu, Shen Baoxu went to the State of Qin to beg for aid. There, he reportedly cried for seven days and nights until the duke of Qin was moved to help rescue the state of Chu.

Chinese:  this character means (violently) sudden. It comes from the name of Bao Xingong, a duke during the Yin dynasty (14011122 bc).

 That he lies, that he spreads disinformation which just clouds the waters.  He has an opportunity to tell the truth, to be something we can trust (which I need.  We need), but instead, he had decided to lie and that just made me disappointed for a couple of years, now I'm pissed off about it.  I even had a phone conversation with him once about his lies.   




 You won't get much more out of Fulford.   




 What is his real name?  IS it Gordon Duff or Robert Foote? 





























 It's happening on its own.  The Baby Boomers (my generation) are largely responsible for the old way of thinking.  Once we are gone (18,000 of us a year until 2020), these old paradigms will be relegated to traditional religious customs.  But Generation Z is largely non-religious (40% according to a recent Pew study), further rendering this influence negligible.  




 There's a city in China called Kunming, where all of the social/gender roles are reversed.   




 I believe it was inevitable that this happened.

First we needed online 24/7 with all the social anonymity it offers (nobody can see you're a girl or a boy when you comment or share)

Then we needed a couple generations to grow up with that permanent access

Young women of this generation (post 1995) have learned that what they say and do online is as good or as valid as anybody else.  It's probably the first generation that is completely empowered to be whatever they want to be without the judgement usually associated with sex/gender.

I think it's a good thing and I'm eager to watch and learn 









 And those aren't females...they are males.  LOL

 Assuming your Collings has F holes, you can't hear it as well because of how the sound is projected from the holes.

A round hole instrument will always sound louder because of the way the sound projects.

 




 I've been playing mandolin since 1970.  I think toneguards are like copper bracelets were in the 1980s...a nice story, but without merit.

If your instrument is not sounding well, consider a set up from a real luthier.  A new (solid) bridge, a neck adjustment, different strings, fret work, a new tailpiece...all of these will have more of a demonstrable result than a piece of metal that clips onto your instrument.

FWIW a good set up is a requirement whether you play a cheap chinese instrument or a handmade luthier built one

Recorded Future, a social media data mining firm backed by the CIAs venture capital arm, says in a report that login credentials for nearly every federal agency have been posted on open Internet sites for those who know where to look. 














 I suspect one of the SJW's saw the file while snooping through the director's desk.  If you've spent any time at UMass, you realize how lax their security is.  Anybody can waltz in off the street and nobody will say boo to them 




 You're ugly and stupid 




 Fuck you you piece of shit

 Where do you live?  It's like this where I live.  I think American children just don't go out and play in their yards like they did when we were growing up...now there's TV, Youtube...video games 









 My favorite part is that women are not shy about sex, sexual positions and what Americans would call "deviant" sex 




 Not much of a sleeper.  Never was.  Only need a couple hours a night...can sometimes go 2 days without sleep 




 I didn't downvote you.  I just read your comment now. 



















 2 more years, OP, and I'll be joining ya!  I'm 63 and worked all my life.  What's it like not working? 




 I played it off and on for a couple of years, but haven't been back in a while.  Without mounts, exploration/questing is a real yawner.  You can't also click a point in the distance and run to it...you have to keep holding down the W key 




 Springfield has the highest murder rate in Massachusetts, and out of a recent survey of the top towns, rated dead last.

Holyoke also has a high crime/murder rate and is one of the unsafest towns in western Mass 




 Mine all look like I want to look (knock-out gorgeous asian women with huge boobs) 




 a colleague's ex wife lived there after the divorce (for about a year).  She said it's infested with druggies, drunks and old people.  avoid it if you can

If you're looking for affordable, yet not too bad, check out:

1.  Belchertown - yeah it's more pricey now than it was 10 years ago, but just a step down from Amherst.

2.  South Hadley - you can find something foreclosed look on Zillow for the latest.  It's a typical new england town full of rednecks and nimby's, but a nice place to live.

3.  Turner's Falls/Montague - yeah there's drugs up there, also poverty, but it's turning around.  Has a nice artist community and is relatively safe.

4.  Shelburne/Buckland - pretty far from everything, but if you don't care about that it's a great place to live

5.  Leeds/Williamsburg/Goshen - see what you can find for housing.  Sometimes you luck out.  Pricier than Belchertown, but close to Northampton.

Places to stay away from:

1.  Ware/Three Rivers/Palmer/Ludlow 

2.  Springfield/West Springfield

3.  Agawam/Westfield

Good luck!

 I realize steam is just a launcher, but I hate it.  It's always causing problems for me.  Why do I have to change the password all the time?  I"m the only one in my house that uses it.

 I don't like trading/crafting.  That's one of the reasons why I found WOW ultimately useless.  If it's a serious part of a game, I won't buy it.

 Hardly a mam.  I'm a 63 year old MD from western Mass.  My wife (of 29 years) is Korean. 




 Yes you can stay for 90 days.  After that, you need to apply for a student or work visa.  You can also marry an American and apply for citizenship (usually about 7 years). 














 Wow.  What's the point of all that.  Why didn't they just send him home?  Is this about saving face? 




 Get a job, marry, have kids, grow old together, buy an RV and travel around the country, build a house out of wood from your own property, go to culinary institute, become a chef, open your own restaurant, raise four strong, confident, beautiful children, nurture them through early marriage and fall in love all over again with grandchildren...

 it's her boobs.  They are very nice.  But they are also fake 




 Agreed.  For the short term as the current generation of conditioned smokers seeks a solution.  But the next generation won't be conditioned, and therefore there won't be a problem

 She's really ugly.  I wonder how she got the job 




 Yep.  And Amherst as I recall

 I play a mandola.  The stretch is not much more than a mandolin.  I can stretch to the 7th fret without too much trouble.

I own two mandolas.  One is a Hora, made in Romania.  Not very nice, about the same price as the truly mediocre Trinity College.  The other is a Big Muddy/Mid Missouri which is a little better, but not much better.  Look around on Craigslist, sometimes you can find a Gibson mandola for around $1800 or so.  I've seen them as low as $900 with some slight damage.

Another idea for you is mandocello.  Of course it's significantly different than a mandolin in every possible way, but closer to a bass. 




 I did.  I talked with her mother.  There is no father anywhere.  The family is originally from Alaska.  The mother fled the father who was abusive to a church in Florida. 




 this belongs in /r/fatpeoplesuck 




 13 year old neighbor waits until her mother leaves for church, then texts her 21 year old boyfriend to come over and fuck her.  she wants to get pregnant so she can get free money, free stuff from the government like her mother did 




 This is an excellent one.  Also, where you're going. 




 Cool swimming platform?q 




 Yeah.  You know she died a few years ago?  Cancer or something.  She was a nice lady.  Used to give my grandson those little Korean yogurt drinks for free when I bought beer there. 




 ugh.  I really hate hangers 




 The most significant thing is where and how tobacco can now be advertised.

 I read elsewhere that he was working with the FBI as an informant. 




 The FBI is in on this. 




 I was one of the first few hundred users of reddit...came here from Fark actually, I can't remember when it was, probably 8 or 9 years ago.  Anyway, I've had 5 accounts banned so far.  I'm actually surprised this one hasn't been banned yet.  It certainly is on some kind of a list, however, because I can't post to certain subreddits, and have to wait 9 minutes to post or comment in others.

So what you do is set up multiple accounts based on what your interests are.  Install a VPN like Tunnelbear and use different browsers, clear your cookies each time.

Or leave.  

 




 Voat rhymes with Goat and smells like Stoat 




 OP didn't you post this last week? 




 What's your point?  Anybody that was watching the news that day saw this footage 




 Still waiting for that EMP, yo 









 it's a paywall.  Do you even internet? 
























 I've reported you for harassment.  Good bye 









 Nana Ogura 




 Voat rhymes with Stoat and smells like Goat 




 I'm not making anything up.  I don't like your tone of voice.  I think you should leave me alone.  This is harassment. 




 I don't trust this guy, Dahboo.  He posts on GLP and 4chan and most of his videos have no documentation to support the wild claims he makes.  Pretty sure Alex Jones and Gordon Duff at least provide some evidence for THEIR wild theories. 




 Right, and as I've stated, I'm a medical professional, hence my interest in the subject matter. 





























 I think they were part of a DHS grant back in 07 or 08.  Most small departments took the money to upgrade back then. 




 It was discovered in Saudi Arabia, not in the US. 




 We all were issued a release from the CDC when the outbreak was first announced.  I don't have a pdf of it as it was printed and handed out as part of a packet of UP documents at the hospital.

Also, in answer to your other question: I'm not in Korea, so no.  But it is on the news here in western Mass, which if you think about it, is pretty incredible.  I mean, we're a tiny fraction of the state...yet we get coverage about the MERS situation in Korea.

if the mods are watching this thread, can you find out why I keep getting an 8 minute block on my comments in /r/korea?  I've been a member for a long time.  It's frustrating. 




 I'm an ER doctor in western Massachusetts (USA).  This outbreak was caused by someone with an attitude like yours.  This man, an elderly doctor, didn't follow universal protocols when he returned from a trip overseas, ignored his own symptoms when they began to present themselves, and was part of a system that preferred to ignore/hide a potential threat rather than treat it seriously.

Is it warranted to say that the Korean culture is largely responsible for this outbreak?  Probably not, but it certainly is a contributing factor.

 I'm with you, buddy.  Obviously you don't live in the ghetto down on Canal street area...

 The app's permissions require that it knows your real id, can view your files and pics and access your camera, etc.

So it's not really anonymous...hq knows who you are 




 The only people infected so far were patients or visitors of the major hospitals where the vector went originally.  The problem is, it has a 10-15 day incubation period, which means most of those people could very well have already infected someone else.  I think they've quarantined most of the exposed people, but some have slipped through the cracks of course.

I suspect if you stay out of the hospitals, was your hands and don't touch anybody else you don't know, you'll be fine.

 I'm antisemitic, but for different reasons than you.  I just think believing a giant dude in the sky is telling you to suck off baby penises is pretty sick 




 Because that's where her work was, apparently  




 Really?  Why is that?  I like it 




 It was a serious question. 




 Everything points to an EMP today 




 where's that EMP though?  Wasn't that supposed to happen first? 




 Nothing around here (10:22am) 




 Google "how is babby formed" 




 Maybe 200 




 IMHO it will take another 100 years for Americans to get over their slave guilt.   




 Because we have this thing called "affirmative action" where if you are of an ethnic minority, you get preferential placement in most publicly held positions (police, fire, education, hospital, government, etc).  I don't mean to sound racist here, but that is why most of the people you see working in government offices are black women, two categories given priority over every other one.
