 Can we duplicate the reddit search field within a subreddit, but as an exclusionary search to act as a filter? Functionality would be equivalent of using regular search field with eg. "*subreddit:technology -comcast*", minus the subreddit specification because inside it and add a "-" in front of search to create a filter. This leaves it purely optional user choice, and allows for a tailoring of user experience within subreddits.

 Pretty sure I've seen videos as to how this played out.
 




 Note Sauron was without the Ring in LOTR, but was quite the formidable adversary nonetheless, and growing in power. Scuppering the Ring in the ocean would not change anything, he was going pretty gangbusters as it was. If he regained the Ring, well, game over, but the only way to ultimately defeat him was to destroy it in the fires in which it was forged.Also to address other points in thread, there are no other volcanoes mentioned to cast it into. and as Gandalf stated:
But there is no smith's forge in this Shire that could change it at all. Not even the anvils and furnaces of the Dwarves could do that. It has been said that dragon-fire could melt and consume the Rings of Power, but there is not now any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough; nor was there ever any dragon, not even Ancalagon the Black, who could have harmed the One Ring, the Ruling Ring, for that was made by Sauron himself. There is only one way: to find the Cracks of Doom in the depths of Orodruin, the Fire-mountain, and cast the Ring in there.

As to sending it away:
But Gandalf has revealed to us that we cannot destroy it by any craft that we here possess, said Elrond. And they who dwell beyond the Sea would not receive it: for good or ill it belongs to Middle-earth; it is for us who still dwell here to deal with it.

So you hide it, you lose; you try to send it West, they won't take it; Bombadil will forget and lose it; nobody is immune to its creeping influence. Much as it sux, and given Sauron's rise and the discovery of the Ring, the only solution - despite being ridiculously difficult, was to get that bitch to Mount Doom baby. 




 I like to think he found rest in the west, beyond the sundering sea.. 









 The veteran: 'There is no real going back. Though I may come to the Shire, it will not seem the same; for I shall not be the same. I am wounded with knife, sting, and tooth, and a long burden. Where shall I find rest?' 




 Which brings us to our next question, in what ways could the Lord of the Rings have played out, had Gandalf been called Gandalf the Greg?

 It's technology-relevant, it will stay in our feed. We don't discriminate either way. Lol you think kids these days should have their information about maybe bad things censored by us? And barbaric? Jebus, do some research mate. Perhaps abrupt, but generally measured in scope and application. What you seem to miss is that it's not a club, just any group anywhere who choose to not name themselves and run around under that name. Bless 'em, if they were nasty I'd ban 'em but frankly they please me and certainly fit our rules where you see them appear. things like [this](http://blogs.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/new-hacker-groups-take-up-the-anonymous-banner), and [this](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/05/201151917634659824.html), and [this](http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos/xjtazd/corporate-hacker-tries-to-take-down-wikileaks) (lol!) and seriously, they are nothing more than modern social activists in the digital sphere. It's like you want us to ban people of colour or women back in the day, no we will not, they're welcome if they fit under the rules voted for by 5  million readers. Welcome to 21C, I don't understand why this even bothers you enough to type so much. Or me to type so much responding for that matter. I must be drunk.. 




 You not understanding the passage of conversation (or wilful negation of) is a poor excuse for yer lack of argument. If it wasn't blindingly obvious (which it really, really was), I'm saying you really have no idea what yer talking about. The more you comment, the more I feel like hugging you as one of our special followers. Just maybe get upset about something else, because this is not something you need to trouble yer precious mind about. To answer yer original query, no. 




 Yea well my opinion is that you really don't know what you're talking about, based on everything you're saying. I appreciate you're working from an ill-informed standpoint (arguably your fault) and that Anonymous may be a pesky fly in your newsfeed, but that river runs deep, and what bugs you is likely [this](https://i.imgur.com/sCQrTOG.jpg), not [this](https://i.imgur.com/g4Q7g40.jpg).

 I love this..really sells the concept!

 Five months later, Lister stared out of the sleeping quarters' viewport window and saw nothing. Just a few, very distant stars, and an awful lot of black. It was pretty much the same view he'd had for the past twenty-one weeks At first he'd found it awe-inspiring Then, slowly, that had given way to just plain dull. Then very dull. Then deeply dull. And now it was something below deeply dull, and even below deeply, hideously dull; a word for which had yet to be devised. It was, he thought, even more mind-numbingly, deeply, hideously dull than an all-nighter at the Scala, watching a twelve-hour season of back-to-back Peter Greenaway movies. If you went to the British Library and changed every word in every single book
 to the word 'dull', and then read out all the books in a boring monotone, you would come pretty close to describing Lister's life on board Red Dwarf. 




 Uh..apologies..I think none of them were the words I was looking for.

 [Chrz but m8](https://i.imgur.com/Lv7iodp.jpg), bedtime.. 




 You reckon he can write a manifesto or put out anthing other than lulzy rants from where he'z currently? Project PM was digging into the shit that nobody took too seriously until the Snowden revelations smashed the doors wide open. He had his foibles, an aristocratic air of snobbery, a penchant for not disagreeing with that he was a mouthpiece for Anon (which doesn't make much sense) but end of day he was an investigative journo who did actually give no fucks in following the story. Was he sloppy? Yes, to his own detriment obviously. And produced nothing? Eh he was a voice sharing what was found. He admits poor skillz, but no point in exposing crime or malfeasance if you have no way to tell anyone about it. So hellz, a FBI shill instigates a raid in a private security company, delivers instructions as to how to pwn them, share linkies with journo in teh loop, he digs into delivered data, fucks up royally online after raids, getz v , faces 100yrz jail for bullshit, and you're gonna complain that he didn't deliver?! Fuckin' 'ell..
 




 We don't even have a Bill of Rights..but you do, and yer Amendments and Constitution an' all..y'all seem to think it's kinda okaaay these days for all that to be ignored. Tell y'what, previous generations didn't. Fuck, look at what Nixon got booted out for. A pittance compared to the shit that's exposed and allowed to slide these days, and y'all just roll over and go 'M'kaaay..' Not much shit happens in this country cuz we're small population at teh ends of the earth (worth taking if yer playing Risk but, then sally forth), but for better or for worse in this era the shit you guys do affects us all, as much as the Brits did at one stage, as much as the Romans did at one stage, as much as the Incas did at one stage (time and location dependent). Our laws are getting tightened as a reflection of your laws getting tightened. Not that yer laws are adhered to anyways (national security blanket), just make a workaround from some schmuck to say hey torture ain't torture and yer good. No accountability, and that sux. Weird thing is, I think our prime minister's an asshole, for so many reasons, not least being that he'z an asshole, but i quite like yer prez. But then I step back and realise that what happens there affects here and I only like him cuz he'z less of an asshole than the past few. What kinda compromise is that?! We're in the shit, YOU'RE in the shit, what was once considered American Values is completely compromised. Whistleblowing against abuse of power by elected officials was traditionally not only considered a protected right of the person, but a respected responsibility of the person. Now you get locked in solitary for the rest of yer bloody life. Nope, yer train is off the rails mate.. 




 Or because he's terribly bored and has no heroin..(or a habit any more so there's that.) Think you're viewing it thru blinkers. Not sure how u came to any of those conclusions, other than him not being the most personable person often before incarceration. What do u want? Is he supposed to spout diatribes from the inside pre-sentencing? Your logig iz all wiggida-wack and your ire misplaced, and your conclusions bullshit. He's actually rather a nice guy. Why u so mad at 'im?

 Yes, this. I find any issue I've ever had has been meticulously broken down before and is only a search away. [List of Excel MVPs](http://www.mvps.org/links.html#Excel) helps, but generally I'd search specifics, and have never failed to find. 




 Witch-king's steed had its head lopped off, so unlikely to be flying anywhere. Also:
The crown rolled away with a clang. Eowyn fell forward upon her fallen foe. But Lo! The mantle and hauberk were empty. Shapeless they lay now on the ground, torn and tumbled; and a cry went up into the shuddering air, and faded to a shrill wailing, passing with the wind, a voice bodiless and thin that died, and was swallowed up, and was never heard again in that age of this world.

So no, wasn't him.

 Copypasta cuz lazy (or efficient)..

While plastic is usually considered an "artificial" material, it is typically a polymer based on organic petrochemical compounds. Polymers can be described as large molecules made up of simple repeating units. The word polymer is derived from the Greek words poly meaning "many" and mer meaning "part". Many types of polymers can be created by varying the molecular composition of the repeating unit.
Being organically-based, polymers are therefore subject to degradation and breakdown through natural oxidisation. Degradation may be initiated or accelerated by numerous factors including ultraviolet light, visible light, ozone, pollutants, manufacturing impurities, oxygen, and heat. During degradation, oxidisation can result in the breaking and rearranging of chemical bonds along the polymer chain. This can begin even during the manufacturing process, due to the conditions of extreme heat or pressure that may be used to form the polymer.
To delay the onset of degradation as long as possible, both process stabilisers and long-term stabilisers are added to the polymer. The most important primary anti-oxidants used for long-term stabilisation are the sterically hindered phenols. Unfortunately, these exhibit an undesirable side effect when exposed to ultraviolet radiation. They develop deeply coloured molecular structures resulting in irreversible yellowing of the plastic. To minimise this effect, polymers are also provided with an ultra-violet stabilisation package. This package is often made up of ultraviolet absorbers (UVA) and hindered amine light stabilisers (HALS).
UVAs protect physically through molecular absorption of the high-energy fractions of sunlight. The absorption transforms the molecule into an excited state, and when it collapses back to its original state, the absorbed energy is released as a thermal emission (heat).
In contrast, HALS protect chemically by combining with oxygen when exposed to sunlight to form stable nitroxide radicals. These trap the oxidising free radicals released when the polymer is exposed to ultraviolet radiation.
Eventually, the stabilisers are either consumed or migrate to the surface of the polymer where they are abraded away. The polymer has then lost its protection and deterioration proceeds rapidly when exposed to the factors mentioned above.
In theory, after-market protectorant products provide a coating to replace or supplement the original UVAs or HALS in the polymer. They cannot, however, reverse any yellowing which is the result of degradation of the sterically hindered phenols within the polymer itself.

 No, I appreciate the dialogue. Not sure where your 7million+ figure comes from. We don't do meta posts for the same reason we don't do  brony posts - it's not technology-related and we are a technology sub. There are plenty of forums for it, but like it or loathe it, we do need to make calls on submissions. We aim to do so openly and transparently, as reddit expects. You're free to complain, or to call us out if you think we're getting it wrong, can chat with us anytime. If you have suggestions, we'll happily hear them, and consider. This is how we came up with our rules, through subscriber consensus. Laws of the sub for the sub by the sub. Anything we change will also require consultation and approval by the sub. Was an exhaustive process to rehabilitate after the dramas (which are actually far more fascinating than people realise,,that shit is almost movie material with MK Shyamalan-Bambalam), but as a tech purist with no agenda nor desire for anything more than a quality tech sub for the tech community. And I (we) approve of all our mods, and don't hesitate to call each other out if we appear to stray from our mission to serve and deliver. Peace out. 




 Yeah, we have the same arguments. What do you do when it's about a tech company but really more business-related, but has ended up popular? Damned if we do, damned if we don't delete. We are looking at the rules to see if we can hone them (subject to sub approval obviously). I'm not 'murikano, so I really don't give a fuck about Comcast, but upvotes say pplz do. Now, is it tech relevant? Y'see, mod dilemma..what do current technology subscribers enjoy vs what should technology sub be That is our problem, and if you have an easy solution, share it. we're damned either way, on the left we drown in fluff and Comcast. on the right do we go hardcore tech on the left. As a general sub, we have to remain a broad techology spectrum. We do have filters, we do have flairs you can filter by. We will never please all the people all the time, it's impossible. Feel free to complain, but undersand we're everything tech-related and delivering as streamlined a service as we can for free. if you have any constructive suggestions as to how we could make it better, we'd welcome that and discuss it. All mods (aside from 2 originals who don't do much) are post shitstorm..was drafted in to fix things. We are not evil, don't paint us with a broad outdated brush. Can say, current mod team is decent. And /u/creq will be creq, you want a creq in your life, keeps shit real..  




 New mods, valid reversals. Our rules were selected by the pplz, voted on and adopted. Some are somewhat vague, which is helpful because it's hard to nail down in one law what can apply to every situation. Should broadly make sense when people read it. But we don't want to preclude valid posts in the technology sphere. Thankfully our readers are extremely helpful in flagging the bad, and frankly I'm proud of the effort of our mod team, coming here each day, cleaning up judiciously, approving, flairing (so you can filter), for nothing more than we like tech. You can yell at us, but I'd prefer you don't. If you have a specific issue, please do. 




 Maybe you missed the extensive consultation process. And no it wasn't. The reason behind no meta is that this is a technology sub, and there are plenty of subs that grievances, real or imagined, can be aired in. It's not something that belongs in a sub about technology. Not in any way hiding from it, you could also ask us directly, we need feedback, and if valid, after discussion, we may change. We are your friends, not some elite with agendas. We are students, professionals, loners, scriptkiddies, unemployed,wise, annoying..and in my case devilishly attractive on top of all of that. Cut us some slack, or just talk to us. 




 Well I haven't seen the specific history, so can't comment on that. I will vouch for creq as a decent human being. And appreciate that he was the canary in the coalmine that exposed the [mod corruption](http://www.dailydot.com/news/reddit-censorship-technology-drama-default/) that nearly killed /r/technology, and I guarantee he's fair and balanced (noit in a Fox way, but like what the words mean), but feel free to message me directly anytime with issues if that would be preferable. We do welcome feedback, ultimately we are trying to just deliver a quality tech stream. For little thanks, but I take the masses that aren't complaining as a good sign. Again, feel free to yell at me/us whenever you see us mess up, helps us improve. 




 So have I..and he really hasn't in excess, and always to keep to rules. We have new mods learning the ropes, mot something you need to get mad about.We're just tech fans trying to deliver tech stuff to you. Getting mad at us..is unwarranted. Talk to us anytime. We understand as well that no matter what we do, someone is going to be pissed off. But generally am happy with us today. Constructive criticism always welcome obv. 




 Oh..may have misinterpreted..just message the mods, button on the leftbar..we will respond, toute de suite depending on timezone, but modcrew are pretty global now. 
 




 That's because subclause of Rule 1 (as chosen, voted upon by all y'all) is no meta posts.  




 Lol! We have quite the congenial and collaborative mod team these days. Tekkies by profession, infoaddicts by nature..the mod hiring process is exhaustive. New crew just drafted in! You can check all that out too if you like. It's a rather time-consuming and thankless role, but ehh, we care.. 




 Jebus cripes..was unintentional mishap in tweaking, we will always remain open. Feel free to yell at us anytime if we deserve it, fair call. Or, y'know, tell us if something ain't right, we'll look at it, sort it, and appreciate the feedback. [Sorry 2 offend.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43V6wA4Y75Q)

 I wouldn't do this. It assumes the two files are always going to be in the same location, or you'll get broken links errors whenever you open the second workbook, as would anyone you send it to. Also each time you change it, you lose the previous data, so no historic records. Why not have a second tab with all your Cell b4 '='Original Sheet'!B4' etc, then when you update it, right-click second tab, move a copy to new book, copy and paste special values to remove links, save it as whatever, then you have a permanent record. You could macro it, but it's 12 mouseclicks.

 From [his website:](http://banksy.co.uk/faq.asp)

*What do you think about people selling the art you put on the street?*

"As a kid I always dreamt of growing up to be a character in Robin Hood.

I just never realised I'd end up playing one of the gold coins."

He could be ridiculously rich if he chose to be. He doesn't appear to care. And he's never spoken out against his art being shared or monetized, merely ridiculed it. He's like the street art Tom Bombadil.

EDIT: [Lolzquote!](http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/apr/24/banksy-works-auction-london-hotel)

"Banksy would like to make it clear  this show has nothing to do with me and I think it's disgusting people are allowed to go displaying art on walls without getting permission."

 Sizewise yes, newswise no. It used to be a broad distinction between broadsheet and tabloid sizings as to content, but today less so as with falling readership many broadsheets have reduced to tabloid size. So tabloid size, broadsheet content to use semi-anachronisms.

 He did say in the Foreword:

The country in which I lived in childhood was being shabbily destroyed before I was ten, in days when motor-cars were rare objects (I had never seen one) and men were still building suburban railways.  Recently I saw in a paper a picture of the last decrepitude of the once thriving corn-mill beside its pool that long ago seemed to me so important.  I never liked the looks of the Young miller, but his father, the Old miller, had a black beard, and he was not named Sandyman.

 Well I guess it comes down to where we define boundaries in a world of spectrums. Which seems somewhat arbitrary. Lions and tigers can produce viable offspring, and you know the others. There seems to be similar issues between the categorisation and cllassification of anmals and planets. We grow up with a black and white understanding, but it's all really rather grey. Maybe it's a a peculiarity of human nature to prefer things to sit in separate buckets when generally the lines are much more blurred than we're comfortable with. I want Brontosauruses and Pluto! Maybe I'm human..

 Well there's this:

But in a win for iiNet and the other Australian ISPs, Justice Perram ordered that any letters sent to alleged illicit pirates must first be seen by him. He said this would "prevent speculative invoicing", which under Australian may not be lawful. ([source](http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/dallas-buyers-club-slays-iinet-in-landmark-piracy-case-20150407-1mey38.html))


Here's what one law firm has to say about it ([link here](http://www.iplawwatch.com/2014/11/downloaded-dallas-buyers-club-the-bill-is-in-the-mail/)):

"While speculative invoicing or pay-now-or-else letters are common in the United States, it has rarely been seen in Australia.

Such letters are often pro forma documents that rely on foreign copyright principles and possibly mischaracterise rights and remedies available under Australian law. For example, some speculative invoicing letters we have encountered commonly demand payment of an unauthorised use licence fee far in excess of the licence fee that would have been payable had the content been reproduced lawfully. Under Australian copyright law, damages for infringement are compensatory and not punitive in nature. In the context of unauthorised reproduction of a film, damages are likely to be calculated by reference to lost royalty the copyright owner would have received for the infringing copy had it been licensed. While exemplary or additional damages are available, these are discretionary and would be unlikely to be awarded where the alleged infringement was made for the sole purpose of private or domestic viewing only."

 Put 'How do you possibly expect me to remember?!' 




 In a letter in which Tolkien first named Alatar and Pallando, also called Morinehtar and Rmestmo, he wrote concerning them:

I think they went as emissaries to distant regions, East and South, far out of Numenorean range: missionaries to enemy-occupied lands, as it were. What success they had I do not know; but I fear that they failed, as Saruman did, though doubtless in different ways; and I suspect they were founders or beginners of secret cults and 'magic' traditions that outlasted the fall of Sauron.

However, in The Peoples of Middle Earth, written by Tolkien in the last years of his life, he said that the Blue Wizards had succeeded in turning the tides of conflict in the East during the Second and Third Ages. Whether this is a revision of what he previously wrote, or whether they were initially successful and then fell, is not known.

The quote from The Peoples of Middle Earth is as follows:

The other two are only known to (have) exist(ed) [sic] by Saruman, Gandalf, and Radagast, and Saruman in his wrath mentioning five was letting out a piece of private information.

The 'other two' came much earlier, at the same time probably as Glorfindel, when matters became very dangerous in the Second Age. Glorfindel was sent to aid Elrond and was (though not yet said) pre-eminent in the war in Eriador. But the other two Istari were sent for a different purpose. Morinehtar and Rmestmo. Darkness-slayer and East-helper. Their task was to circumvent Sauron: to bring help to the few tribes of Men that had rebelled from Melkor-worship, to stir up rebellion ... and after his first fall to search out his hiding (in which they failed) and to cause [? dissension and disarray] among the dark East ... They must have had very great influence on the history of the Second Age and Third Age in weakening and disarraying the forces of East ... who would both in the Second Age and Third Age otherwise have ... outnumbered the West 




 Hi guys, I've just trawled your website and I'm impressed by what I see. Do you have any plans to spread internationally, because my country could really do with what you say you offer. 




 Legit.
 




 Means nothing if he can't get fast track (which looks doubtful), and enough popular anger becomes apparent. Don't give up, the only way it is sure to pass is if everyone believes it cannot be stopped (or more likely doesn't know about it and how it's likely to affect so much of everything). That said, I'll be going down in flames trying in my country to ensure it isn't ratified if it gets the initial nod. Educate the voting public. This is by far the worst we've seen in recent yearsm which is impressive because we've seen a shit ton. This basically enshrines the rights of corporations in international law superceding national law. Yes it may bolster the US economy in a changing world, but to the detriment of us all. I never in my wildest nightmares envisioned President Obama envisioning this as crown jewels in his legacy. There is scope certainly for sections of it, but everything we see when it gets leaked is so flawed. The participants in drafting it are not representative of the populations it affects, they are by and large corporate interests. This is not a platform we want to enshrine in international law. So get mad now, or regret later. 




 Mass contacting via tools such as those listed above is precisely how CISPA, SOPA/PIPA, ACTA, TAFTA to name a few were stymied. It truly is the most effective way to make a difference, contact your representative and make your opinion clear. Most of them don't even read the damn legislation, too busy fundraising for reelection. Fair enough, they like their jobs. But whilst they rely on donors to fund their prospects, their fate is in the hands of you the people. According to staffers and interns who have commented on this in these threads, they do pay a lot of attention to numbers of constituents who actually chime in on particular issues, because they do not usually get that much traffic, so when they receive an avalanche of angry calls they extrapolate from that to the voting population and pay attention. And whether it passes does not depend on Obama, but on the votes in Congress. Yes, we can kick it's ass, with online participation. There is strength immeasurable in collective action. Apathy and the false impression of powerlessness kills it. There is already considerable disgruntlement with it amongst progressives and libertarians. We need only push en masse to sway the tide of fencesitters.

 Actually, pure gold is not soft enough to deform by biting. People would cut it with lead, suitably heavy and would mix without discoloring. Also made it softer, so if your bite left an imprint, it was *not* pure gold. Not that Olympic gold medals are pure gold anyway. The last series of Olympic medals to be made of solid gold were awarded at the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm, Sweden. Modern Olympic gold medals are required to be made from at least 92.5% silver, and must contain a minimum of 6 grams of gold. So there y'go..

 Israel doesn't. There is the opinion that it has become more right wing with the influx of the diaspora from Russia and eastern Europe. We only really get to hear from Americans who are there because easier soundbite, and the more brave the better. It's unsustainable, history moves slow, but maybe we'll get the compromise we need next election. Netanyahu is a cancer on progress, and a self-serving asshole at that, he does not demonstrate a love of country, he demonstrates a love of Bibi, do anything say anything, stir up the red meat of right-wing hatred to the detriment of all in order to stay in power. he is a blight on Israel and a danger to the world. God help us what this term will bring. There is great risk in this play, the guy is incongruous with peace and a pivotal destabiliser. I hope for the best, but I cannot see this turning out pretty for Israelis or Palestinians, or anyone. The guy is a fucking socio-wartard..

 What the hell's wrong with the .net domain name?!

The domain name net is a generic top-level domain (gTLD) used in the Domain Name System of the Internet. The name is derived from network, indicating it was originally intended for organizations involved in networking technologies, such as Internet service providers and other infrastructure companies.

Do you prefer commercial (.com) to networks (.net)?
