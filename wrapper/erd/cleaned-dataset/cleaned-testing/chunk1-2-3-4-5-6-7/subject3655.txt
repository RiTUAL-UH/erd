 Yeah I was about to say, there's no way you've gotten to college yet. 




 Ah, I was indeed loosely misinterpreting the thread. 




 Um, what were you thinking? Every username I typed in was already taken so my friend said "Just stop, man" So...what exactly were you thinking? 




 Really? Can't that fuck up your teeth? 




 Where is 'snog' used as a word for that? Unless it means something else and I'm wildly misinterpreting this whole thread. 




 Wait...

 My wife knows none of this.

 Not only is this a repost, but its already been reposed in this post's comments twice. Repostception. 




 How much? 




 Blind people of Reddit, how the fuck are you on Reddit? 




 THAT WAS YOU??? 




 Dear lord, should have made a throwaway... 




 No...but...haven't you seen South Park? 




 Good god man, get a hold of yourself! 




 What exactly do you use this account for?

Hence the 'Dallas Diddler'? 




 That seems...excessive. 









 Lets make a thread. I'll start with '1' and the next person choses 2 and 3 and so on. We're coming for you, daddydean...

 Any reason for the chair in the locker? Nice jersey too, but in my mind the chair mystery is really stealing the show right now. 




 Either [Save Tonight] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nntd2fgMUYw) or [Away and Anywhere] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXBjn2s8ofQ). Its weird, they both calm me down and get me pumped up at the same time. No idea how to explain it.

 No, probably not. 




 There was a joke in 'The Interview' that says somthing along the lines of "Don't shake his hands, hes a Jew" I saw the joke coming and realized that the three other people me and my friend were watching it with were very Jewish. Not just a little Jewish. Anyways the joke comes along and my friend lets lose the loudest laugh of the entire movie. He claims it wouldn't have been awkward if anyone else laughed, but no one did. It was awkward as fuck. 




 I just saw you answered today, but reading this shit really isn't worth my time. To be honest I can't believe your still going down swinging about all this, you were wrong a long time ago. Are you incredibly stubborn, or do you really have nothing better to do than keep arguing online in this sad lonely life of yours? Probably both I suppose. Anyhow, its getting too tiring correcting you countless mistakes and inaccuracies, so log off and go away. You gave it a good shot, but you lost. By a lot. By the way, the log off button is on the upper right side of the screen. I know how fragile your mind is and wouldn't want you to have a brain aneurysm trying to find it.

 Not an 'official' word? Sorry Dr. Seuss, but there's no such thing as an 'official' word, there are words and there are letters put together in groups. You yourself provided an excellent example of this, 'commenter' I believe you called it. I suppose though, if you really want to use your 'unofficial' language, I can direct you to what I like to call ['The Dictionary of High School Dropouts'] (http://www.waywordradio.org/Official_Dictionary_of_Unofficial_English-Grant-Barrett-0071458042.pdf), even in there though I don't think you'll find 'commenter'.

Also, it's a good barometer to see when someone is losing an argument when they stoop to nitpicking word usage.

A barometer is a meteorology device, not an standard by which to measure debates. See what I did there? Probably not. Anyhow do you know what nitpick means? It means to be excessively concerned with or critical of inconsequential details. So are you saying that your looking up the definition of your fake word wasn't nitpicking? Are you saying the defining an already meaningless word and proving its nonexistence wasn't nitpicking? Because either you just used the word nitpicking wildly incorrectly, or you yourself nitpicked, which-by your own admission-is the sign of someone (in this case you) losing an argument. So which is it? Are you wrong *again* or are you losing the argument? Now that I think about it, I suppose it could easily be both.

As for irony, I said it because you have repeatedly said I lack intelligence, when it is clear to even the untrained eye that it is in fact you who is the real unintelligent fool.

The only thing I can say about this sentence is that it is the most grammatically fucked up thing I've seen in a long while.

It was getting embarrassing, I'm glad you saw that. I still can't believe you thought a defensive player was one of the Patriots top recivers! Truly pathetic. The good news is, you've admitted you embarrassing blunder and can move forward with a new lesson learned.

If you really want to pick back up your retarded football talk I'm more than willing, you just seemed to be falling behind. A debate is no fun when I need to keep going back to explain things to you. In fact, I didn't even read your last comment on football. I can only assume it was filled with factual and grammatical errors and inaccuracies. Not that I expected any more from you. Tell me, do people always have to dumb it down for you, or only when your talking about football and other subjects you've barely even heard of? Grammar for example. 




 So my comment is gone, not sure why, maybe it was deleted. I needed to used some truly harsh language to capture your personality and intelligence quotient, I can't help but think the mods didn't appreciate that. Or maybe they could see you were losing you battle by a landslide and decided to put you out of your misery. Either way, here's no way in hell your worth typing that out a second time (or even a first time for that matter, I guess I was just feeling nice :), your welcome). So I guess your just not getting an answer unless the mods give it back. Sorry to disappoint, I know how much you love getting proven wrong. Why else would you say such stupid things?? A tout a l'heure.

EDIT: Nah, I need to put you out of your misery myself. Its the least I can do for such an unfortunate child such as yourself-tell me, how was it to grow up without an education? I'll respond later, but I'm sure you won't like it. If you're asking for it though, fine by me. 









 Your the best! 




 Amendola was brought in to replace Welker, who had 1000 yard seasons with over 100 catches. Amendola wasn't even close to those numbers.

If you think that Bill Belichick tried to replace Wes Welker with Danny Amendola your a bigger idiot than I thought. He brought in a new receiver, period. Why wouldn't you call Donald Jones Wes Welker's replacement? Or Aaron Dobson? Or Josh Boyce? Or Michael Jenkins? Or Jake Ballard? Because they all came in when Welker left, so why is the burden supposed to lie on Danny Amendola? That's some retarded logic your're trying to argue with. Just because they came in at the same time, they must be trading off rolls? If anything, Juilian Edleman is Wes Welkers 'replacement'. Not sure why you thought Amendola was.

He has 3 good games in 2 years. I think your definition of great is a little off.

If you think he's only had three good games in two years, well your already a bigger idiot than I thought. Your a bigger idiot than the bigger idiot I thought you were before? Eh, its redundant, I'm sure you and your general lack of intelligence will prove me wrong again. As for Amendola, he hasen't played much more than three games. Obviously not three whole games, that's not the way Bill Belichick plays his players. He takes them for a reason, for example Blount's power running on third downs or Gonkowski's inside routs in the red zone. He plays them for specific plays, not all of them. The way you keep talking seems like you think every player plays every snap. If you ran an NFL team, dear god they'd be in trouble. This isn't something I should have to explain to you, literally team does this, it's a very easily comprehended part of football. Try to keep up.

That is one of the worst comparisons I have ever seen. I appreciate the try, but goddamn dude, you need to learn how to make an argument.

See, this is why your worse at making an argument than I am. You don't respond to what I said, you respond to the way I said it. Who gives a shit how I said it? My underlying thesis doesn't change, but unfortunately you missed that because you didn't like 'my comparison'. Was my point weather or not a comparison was good? No. Then why do you feel the need to waste time going off on a pointless tangent? Maybe it's because you don't have an answer, so you're changing the subject. Hope not, that would just be depressing. I hope your keeping notes, it might be good for you to know how to carry on a debate some day.

Nope, not even close. It was a counterpoint to you? saying that Brady makes all his receivers great. Rookies or not, they under performed.

Since when is 466 yards and 4 touchdowns in your first season in the NFL 'under-preforming'? And Dobson did even better, 519 yards and 4 touchdowns. Obviously its not something you'd want to see out of a third or fourth year player, but first?? That's not under-preforming, hell he could have been sitting on the bench as a back up and he wouldn't have been under-preforming as a rookie. Get your head out of your ass, these are some very solid rookie years. Go ahead, disagree with that. I didn't think your stupidity was expanding but you've surprised me before.

Are you seriously basing your entire argument that Tom Brady can make anyone look like a star, on one comment from Christain Fauria?

Ha! You made me actually laugh out loud, that's rich! Every time you say something it seems I think 'Wow, I didn't think he could prove himself any more of an idiot, but I'll be damned, I was wrong'. Of course I'm not basing an argument off of Christain fucking Fauria-do you even know who that is?? I did however use his quote as a source to support my argument. Debate 101, maybe you should take it. Jesus Christ this is exhausting trying to get through to people like you. Going back and explaining every sentence is like talking to a six year-old. Literally.


By the way, mentioning Matthew Slater was a test to see if you have any idea what your talking about. Clearly you don't. Slater plays DEFENCE. Didn't catch that.

Did I need to?

YES, YOU SHOULD FUCKING KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OFFENCE AND DEFENSE. How can you even try to carry on a debate about football when you don't know the two?? Its not a mind game at all, but rather a very simple and transparent test to see of you have any idea what your taking about or not. Turns out, your full of shit. I still can't believe that you argued against me by saying a defensive player has bad reviving yards. That's more than pathetic.

You think you are some witty commenter with all the right comments, but you haven't even come close to anything right this entire time.

Nice. No seriously good one, give yourself a pat on the back for that zinger. And it would even make sense too if 'commenter' was a word and if it was the least bit true. *You're* the one I have to keep correcting, and you don't even seem to understand half the shit your saying. It's come to the point where I've considered leaving you to your blissful yet idiotic ignorance, but I'm a charitable person, I keep returning to educate you. Push you luck though and your going to end up one very moronic 'football expert'. Even saying that sarcastically insults the real moronic football experts of the world, your much worse than that. You were right about one thing though, Matthew Slater is not a very good receiver. 




 Okay so I guess you officially give up on what this entire debate was about in the first place, I'll put one in the win column and move on to what ever asinine point you want to debate next.

Your whole argument is flawed, because its based on the point that I'm somehow defending the Patriots in this whole ball-deflation thing. I'm not. At all.

What I am defending however this the just system of due process. So until there is an official statement from the NFL announcing 'the Patriots cheated' no, I do not call that cheating. Why you ask? First of all the sources that supply this information are rarely sound. The guy that announced this whole deflation issue in the first place said that the Patriots used illegal balls and equipment. Clearly this was a very distorted image of the truth, and if is these people were relying upon, we can't take anything they say for anywhere close to certian.

Second, well...do you even know how game process works with regards to the game balls? They are delivered to the stadium where they are opened by a sealed container *by the referees* where they are marked *by the referees* to prevent someone from replacing them. Then they are filled with air *by the referees* and measured *by the referees* who's responsibility it is to take care of them until game time. The only time the footballs are under the control of one of the teams is on the field during the game. You might say 'Well ha! Got you! The Patriots probably deflated the balls just before or during the game!' but you'd be wrong. Inflating and deflating the game balls requires equipment that is simply not available on the field. Anyone seen taking 12 footballs to a machine pushed off to the side would clearly be seen, if not in person than on video. The only other way to deflate them would be to take a knife to the footballs. Probably not what happened. My point is that there is almost no chance for the teams to get a hold of the balls to somehow alter them before the game. There is a very good chance that there was an error made by someone employed by the NFL (probably a referee) that brought the footballs down two pressurized pounds.

My point was never that messing with the game balls wasn't cheating, my point was that there is a lot left unsaid and that even if the Patriots were found to be 100% guilty, it would still be a non-issue. 




 LaFell was already a good receiver? Does that make Danny Amendola a good receiver? Because last year when LaFell was 'already good' he got 627 yards. Danny Amendola, who 'isn't even doing decent' got 633 yards last year. So which is it? Was he 'already good' or was Amendola not only on par with him but arguably better? Get your facts straight and stop contradicting yourself, it's exhausting cleaning up someone your messes.

And Danny Amendola hasn't under preformed at all, in fact when he's on the field he's been doing great. Unfortunately for him though, he's gone almost completely unused. How can you say he's under-preforming when he doesn't play? That's like saying jimmy Garoppolo (Brady's backup) sucks because he only got 100 yards. The person expecting him to get more yards is the idiot in this scenario, not the other way around.

As far as the rookies go, care to name them just to be sure were all on the same page? I think we are for the most part but I wouldn't want us to be addressing completely separate people. Who says their best isn't minimal numbers though? Is your point that rookies can't suck? Just because they're drafted doesn't mean they're good by any means. Unless they're a first or early second round pick, it only means that they could potentially have potential, there is no where close to a guarantee that they are good.

But hey! Guess what! You got something right! Michael Hoomanawanui (for future reference, that's how you spell it) doesn't have good numbers. You know why I chose him? I chose him very deliberately. I chose him because my point was that Brady can turn anyone into a star. Christian Fauria said, and I quote, "These people don't know his name yet, but Tom Brady's making him look like a star out there tonight". My point was never that Hoomanawanui had thousand yard seasons, to be honest I don't even know where you got that from. Keep your eye on the ball 'corby'.

By the way, mentioning Matthew Slater was a test to see if you have any idea what your talking about. Clearly you don't. Slater plays *DEFENCE*. Didn't catch that? He has one recorded reception *EVER*. And you think I'm the one that failed, ha! You have the entire internet at your disposal, but even that wasn't enough to get your head out of your ass. But hey, nice job 'shutting me down'. Don't worry corby, you'll get em' next time.



EDIT: Sorry, I couldn't bear giving you that false hope at the end. Sorry corby, but you actually probably won't get em' next time. Maybe if you lose the suborn ignorance and your debate is against an idiotic five year-old you'll win one, but even then I'm not 100% sure. 




 I'll take your slight redirction as a full surrender. As I was saying, non-issue. But if you don't have any response to what I said before, I understand. Now you can either admit defeat, come up with a reasonable counterpoint (good luck) or try to desperately change the subject. *Again*. 




 Can you make this but with Revis in black and white? That would look dramatic as fuck, please! 




 You can creep on me if you want. Curious of what my internet preception is. 




 You meaning me? No, I didn't break any rules. Not sure why your addressing me personally.

If you mean 'the Patriots didn't break the rules' no, that's not what I'm saying at all-did you even read what I said? What I'm saying is that the entire ball deflation thing is a non-issue. Clearly regardless of what happened didn't change the outcome of the game, hell they could have been playing with Nerf footballs and it wouldn't have changed the outcome of the game, but there are many more 'issues' in the NFL that are getting ten times less attention just because the teams involved aren't headline attention grabbers.

In summary, there are many issues and non-issues in the NFL, this falls under the non-issue category. 




 Really? Again? Matthew Slater, Brandon LaFell and Michael Hoomanawanui to name a few.

To be honest I can't tell if your making my point about Danny Amendola or not. My point is Ameldola has been doing decent considering how much time hes spent actually on the field, but all in all he's not a very good receiver (which anyone who knows anything about Danny Amendola is aware of), and that Tom Brady doesn't have much to work with with regards to a receiving core...which you confirmed for me as if you were some how proving me wrong by supporting my point... Whatever.

And my point about the rookies is we can't tell if they're better under Tom Brady or not because we haven't seen them under any other circumstances. How the hell would we know if Tom Brady brings out their best if we haven't seen them with any other quarterbacks? For all we know, that *is* their best.

Do *you* know what your talking about? Because it certainly doesn't seem like it when I have to spell everything out for you. 




 Okay, you want to talk about really cheating? 'Flat out cheating'? Blow-deflated-footballs-out-of-the-water cheating?

http://phins.com/chris/column_050908.html

Is that not enough? I'll dig out more if you have another 'counter point' but the fact is that people simply don't care if the teams involved aren't winning. Period. If not, explain to me why the Patriots were the only team that got any attention for taping other teams when others were caught doing the same exact things and then some? And why are people still talking about it despite more recent scandals with even more definitive proof involving other teams? Because they aren't winning, so it must not be news. 




 Amendola is doing decent, and the two rookies are rookies. My point is he brings out the absolute best potential in his players and has the ability to make even a bad receiver look like a star. I'm not saying they're all bad receivers by any means, but he makes them look a hell of a lot better. 




 Wow, last year but same people! I would love to have that job every season... 




 The Jets got caught recording opponent's signals a year before SpyGate, did anyone care? No. The Raiders were known for over inflating footballs beyond their legal limit (as are the Packers apparently), does anyone care now? Nope. The Lions ran multiple deceptive plays where they threw to a lineman as an eligible receiver *this year*, did anyone bat an eye?? No one.

Apparently there are many "non-issues" going on, just involving poor franchises. They've all been caught but did you hear about it? Nope. Did you hear about it before there was even an ounce of proof that the Patriots did it? Absolutely.

If the NFL is willing to catch and release like that its clearly a non-issue. Just because a big team supposedly does what the little teams are doing shouldn't make it any more or less of an issue. They've all been caught, but no one cares until a winning team might be involved. If it's an issue, than the little teams should be addressed just as harshly by the NFL and the media as the big teams. If not, then it's simply a not an issue. 




 I don't know, I really like [NFL on CBS] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idNhIdw2Bpo).

EDIT #2: How did I forget [March Madness] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhC5-uIJJWQ)?!! 




 Even though Tom Brady didn't have the records the past few years, I still think hes the best. I mean most great quarterbacks have an arsenal of receivers to chose from to make their stat sheet look good, not Brady. Who does he have this year? The list starts and ends with Rob Gronkowski. Everyone else is decent to average. Despite this, Tom Brady makes them look good. Brandon LaFell? Matthew Slater? Even Julian Edelman? These guys aren't stars by any means, but under Tom Brady everyone is turned into a dangerous weapon. Even when he doesn't have a team, Tom Brady takes them to the playoffs every year. Literally, every. Singe. Year. That's why hes the best. Well, one of the reasons. 




 Thats a big *IF*. Where do these allegations come from anyways? Did a Colts fan decide Sunday night "45-7? Must be trickery! Get Roger on the phone!" The media's reception of sports scandals always reminds me of the Salem witch trials. Someone is accused of something and then with out a trial or so much as proof suddenly they're guilty. Maybe I should accuse Russel Wilson of greasing Barndon Bostick's gloves (hes the guy who dropped that onside kick), just to even the playing field. 




 You still want New England?? 47-7... If I were you I would want a win, not a risk.

 Even with the tags, I don't think you should post stuff like this unless you specify how gigantic a spoiler it is in the title or until it at least happens in the show.

 For some reason the contractor that designed my house put the door bell in the bathroom. I've had many an electrician try to fix it, but apparently the single wire going from my front door to the bathroom is absolutely vital to the structural integrity of the entire house. I wouldn't mind the door bell, its usually not that bad when your not in the bathroom. When you are though...you know how you jump out of your seat when theres a BANG! in a scary movie? Similar concept, very different end result. Its come to the point where Im scared to shit in my own home. This house has taken the most basic of human rights from me...

Ive been collecting it for a few years now, very proud of what I have so far. I have a few more Im working on finishing that are missing a few autographs. Anyone know Kirk Hammett? Ive been trying to track him down since 2008...

 Singers make songs all the time that claim they've done drugs, stolen, assaulted, etc. yet no one ever gets arrested for that. And in Anthony Keidis' (Red Hot Chili Peppers singer) autobiography he talks about a life full of illagal drug and substance abuse, yet he's probably never even been questioned by the police (well...). Hell theres videos on Youtube of Wiz Khalifa smoking weed! I'm pretty sure though that if I was caught with a recording or self-written note admiting to any type of crime that I would be arrested on the spot, so why aren't they?

EDIT: I don't necessarily want to see any of these people prosecuted, I'm just curious why they arn't.

 It almost sounds like you're talking about the [Immigrant Song] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66ChMPV0LTg)... 









 I read that line over *way* too many times. I figured this was published on a fairly respected tech blog, so it must be me who's doing something wrong. 




 This is going to get burried, but to me its by *far* [Quixoticelixer] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bCQeE2L3ISI) by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The best b-side EVER. Seriously, good can an album be to shave off a song like this? 




 I wrote both of them well after. 




  nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I hadn't planned on writing a follow up to [this] (http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2w8arl/the_window_washer/), but a few people asked what happened to me next. So here it is.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I read the message again. And again. And again I didnt want to believe what it said. Maybe I had misread it? Or misunderstood it? No, no it was much too simple to be misconstrued. He was coming after me.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I forced myself to snap out of it and ran over to the lifts console. I quickly pushed the lever up and waited as the lift lazily crawled upwards. I would have gone down if I could, but these kinds of machines only go down to the 14th floor. Going up was the only option.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I couldnt help but to cringe at the leisurely speed of the lift. One Chase Plaza is only 60 stories tall, but I still had a dozen to go. I found myself nervously glancing at the railing on the roof to see if he had made it. So far so good. 49th floor...50th floor Ten left.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I tried to get the attention of anyone working in the building, but most had already left by now. I got the attention of a janitor, but he just smiled and waved to me, oblivious to my peril. I didnt give up. Every floor I passed I pounded on the glass and yelled at the top of my lungs.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;51...52...

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I glanced back up and froze. There he was. Looking over the railing smiling down at me. I reached towards the console to stop the lift but he laughed and shook his knife like a finger saying no. Then he ran over to the turbine collecting the wire that was hauling up the lift. To my horror, he started hacking and stabbing at, breaking the wires one thread at a time. He started panting between his hysterical laughs. *This man is a monster!*

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; I had never been more scared of anyone in my entire life. Every few hacks would send a jolt through the entire lift, it started to tilt like a ship taking on water. I moved to the raised end completely helpless. I needed to get to the roof to get off of the failing lift, but doing that forced me closer toto him. I looked down in terror at the streets below. Should I jump? Should I end things on my own terms? I shuddered, and reached for the console.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;He must have seen me because he let out a scream like no noise I had ever heard before. Nooooooo! he hissed.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I looked up just in time to see him lose patience with the wires. He reached for the railing and launched himself over, hurling knife first at me. I yelled and dove towards the lowest part of the lift. He missed, but just barely. The entire structure shuddered under the impact. Before I knew it he was back on his feet and charging at me. I backed up until I could feel the cold metal railing behind me, I had no where to go. Like the woman had been in her office, I was trapped.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;In a final act of desperation I jumped into the air and slammed myself down as hard as I could onto the failing lift. The cables buckled under the pressure and nearly snapped. It sent a shockwave through the lift and sent us both off our feet. I expected it though and grabbed on. He didnt. His feet went out from under him and sent him down onto his face. The knife flew out of his hands and skidded towards me.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;There was no time to think. I grabbed the knife and ran over the man. 59...60. Yes! I jumped over the roofs railing and turned to face the man, knife in hand. For the first time he wasnt smiling at me, the expression on his face was one of shock. Then it turned to anger. He began to scramble to his feet screaming. I ran to the wire coil and looked back at him. ILL KILL YOU! he screamed. That was all the motivation I needed. I swung the knife as hard as I could at the weakened wire.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;For a second I thought I hadn't cut through it, but then I heard a series of loud popping noises and a section of the lift lurched downwards. The cable snapped and the other chords began to pop one by one. Every time the lift dropped a few more feet he laughed harder and harder until the weight was too much to bear. The remaining cables snapped and the lift fell into the open air. He laughed hysterically the whole way down...

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I was stunned. I almost couldnt move, the knife fell from my hands and followed the man to the ground. I didn't wait around for it to hit the sidewalk though, I couldnt bear to watch. I got myself together and walked back to the elevator. I got some looks for my torn up and battered uniform, but I didnt care. On my way out I asked a concierge to call the police, which she did without hesitation after she got a look at me.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I stepped out the front door and saw the lift immediately to my left. It had landed partially on top of a parked town car, but no one seemed hurt. I looked back up at where the lift had fallen from, broken cables were swaying in the breeze. A crowd was slowly gathering around the lift, and I was pushed inwards closer to it. Thats when I realized something truly alarming, I hadn't seen the man's body yet. A chill rushed through me as my eyes darted across the lift looking for something, anything. I forced myself to walk onto it. I needed to know it was over for good, I needed to know he was dead. I didn't find him though, I found the last thing I ever wanted to see: another note.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I picked it up, it was almost identical to the one he left on the window. It was beaten up and covered in drops of blood. I read it. *No* I read it again. *He couldnt have*

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Between tears and blood stains in the paper the message read:

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;You should have kept the knife

 No I got the point with the "they can't understand complex sentence structure" but it just goes way too far. 




 Um, well I would say you should probably finish reading before you comment next time. Besides though, aren't comments like these not allowed? 




 Thanks dude, that means a lot. 




 Haha I thouht that a few seconds after I wrote it but by then it seemed vital to the storyline. Not really, but that was the excuse I used to keep it in. 




 Please repot back after you ask, I think we would all like to know. 




 Oh no, an incomplete jump. It seems as if he didn't even try until he was almsot the quarters of the way there. 




 I smell a Giants fan...care to weigh in, OP? 




 Its so inorganic it makes it a little painful to read. The best way to sound smart in writing is to only use words you actually use when you speak. If you want to write using fancy words, expand your vocabulary.

vendor of fuel and complex carbohydrates.

Its called a gas station, a petrol station if your British. This is the other thing that bugged me, don't go out of your way to sound smart. It's completely condescending and it makes you look desperate. 




  nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I am the man who washes your windows. Well, I am at least if you work at One Chase Manhattan Plaza. Every day, five to five, Im outside on my lift washing windows. Window by window, floor by floor, Monday through Saturday. I know what you're probably thinking, but its not all that bad. I like to work outside, and the pay is very reasonable. And when the weather gets bad or dangerous were required to stay inside but still get paid! Score!

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I began today as I do most every other day. I walk in the front door, take the industrial elevator all the way to the roof, and prepare my lift for a days work. After I make sure everything is safe and sound I start maneuvering the metal-death-basket over the side of the building. No matter how many times I do this, it will never cease to scare the living shit out of me. There is something about stepping off the edge and putting all of your life in the hands of a machine that you can never quite get used to. And on top of that, the only tiny holding you up is four tiny chords. If even one snaps, the whole thing is going down. But I try not to think about that. Once I'm actually out there I'm usually fine.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;When the hard part is over, I drop down to the 20th floor or so and then work my way back up. The lift is slow, and a peaceful long ride is a nice way to wake up.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Under normal circumstances I would have a partner up here with me, but weve been a little understaffed lately. By lately, I mean the past four months. New workers were supposed to be hired to fill the open spots, but the building manager has yet to find anyone suitable for the job. In other words, he doesn't want to pay for any more staff members and is putting it off for as long as possible. Technically that breaks a quite a few safety violations, but I dont mind. Its kinda nice to be alone out here.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;This kind of job can be pretty interesting too. Being a window washer gives you an unavoidable glance into the lives of 100 or so corporate employees on a daily basis. Whether they want me to or not, I get a front row seat to everything happening in their offices. On multiple occasions Ive seen employees sleeping, doing drugs, fist fighting, even fucking (sometimes a few at the same time). Ive even seen more than one example of corporate fraud. Employees always think if their desks face away from the door their privacy is being protected from wandering eyes, but in reality its the window they should be worried about.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Today actually turned out to be pretty boring though. For the most part, people either werent in their offices, or were doing actual work. How mundane. As I pulled up to the 47th floor the sun was already setting and people were going home. When I least expected it though, I stumbled upon something interesting. On the 47th floor there was an older woman shouting at some poor guy who had clearly royally fucked up. Her expensive looking suit implied she was some sort of executive, while his loose fitting dress shirt and pants made him look like a green intern. It was getting pretty intense in there, I could hear the muffled curses and threats through the glass. The man just stood there though and took what was coming to him. No matter how much she yelled and shouted, he would just stare back blankly. It was almost freaky how emotionlessly he was handling the situation.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;The man eventually left the office and the woman sighed and returned to her desk. She noticed me for the first time then, and sent me a wry smile. I thought she would be happy to take some pent up anger out on an intern, but she didnt seem to enjoy the shouting any more than he liked being shouted at. What a terrible situation, truly a lose lose for everyone. I did my best to ignore her and keep washing the windows.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Suddenly there was another commotion in her office. The intern had returned, but this time he was the one yelling at his boss. She was clearly caught off guard, as evident by the shocked look on her face. *You idiot* I thought, *you were in the clear, shes going to fucking fire you now!* Suddenly he stopped talking and turned around to shut the door. He kept his back turned for a while, I could see the woman tilting her head to try to see what he was doing. He twisted his head towards her and smiled. Then he turned to reveal what it was he had been concealing. A huge metal knife.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I suddenly found myself paralyzed with fear. I had seen a lot through these windows, but nothing like this. Even though I was outside there was only two inches of glass between me and this psychopath. The sudden turn of events caught me completely off guard and left me almost too shocked to react. I cant even imagine how the poor woman inside must have felt. She screamed and jumped out of her chair in a helpless attempt to defend herself. It didnt do much. He rushed her, wildly screaming and swinging as he charged forward. He never stopped smiling.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;She had nowhere to run, he quickly caught her. A fine spray of red immediately stained almost an entire wall of her office. Then another. And another She laid sprawled out on the floor in a slowly growing pool of dark red. I was stunned and appalled. *This isnt happening, this isnt happening* I thought to myself, knowing full well that no matter how many times I said it it would never change what I was seeing just before my eyes.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;He left the woman dying on the floor. She was no longer screaming, I dont think she had the energy left. Before she stopped moving for good though she looked back towards me. Our eyes locked. I felt a sudden rush of sadness and grief pass over me, this woman was barely clinging to life and there was nothing I could do to help her. She kept watching me as she took her last breath.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;The man walked over her body to see what she was doing. He slowly bent down and traced her eye lineto me. Our eyes met. He saw me. He knows I had saw him. I panicked. I ran across the lift to my utility bag. Hands shaking, I fumbled through it. *Where is it?!* Yes! I grabbed my phone and tried to flip it open. I was rushing too quickly though, and the little phone went flying from my shaking hands and off the side of the building. FUCK! I looked back up at the office. What I saw before me made me jump backwards so hard I hit the back of the lift. He was standing in front of me, nose pressed up against the glass, grinning ear to ear. His loose clothes were torn and bloodied and his knife was still dripping wet. I was terrified, this man was a monster.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;He backed away from the glass for a moment to get something on the woman's desk. I couldnt see what he was doing, his back was to me. Like the woman had done, I tried to look around him and see what it was he was working on. He was hunched over whatever it was though, I couldnt see anything. Suddenly he spun around and slammed a piece of paper onto the inside of the window. A piece of tape kept it from falling and stuck it to the glass. Before I had a chance to examine it he shot me one last smirk and ran out of the office. I didnt hesitate, I went straight over to the paper. It was a note. I couldnt read the sloppy writing at first, but soon it came together.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Between tears and blood stains in the paper the message read:

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Youd better hope you make it to the roof before I do

 Yeah...theres a plan. 




  nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Mary loves to take selfies. Whenever I see her she insists that we take at least one. It happens so much that we have a routine. She puts her purse on her right arm, and her left arm around me. I put my right arm around her, and point at her phone with my left hand.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Shes become very particular about how we take these selflies. Everything must be perfect. Our hair must be neatly combed, we must stand up straight, her phone must be positioned at a perfect angle. If something doesn't go perfectly as according to plan, Mary gets angry. Very angry.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Mary stopped taking selfies in public. There are too many distractions in public. 'Too many things that can go wrong' she says. I don't mind though; its nice to have a break from it.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Mary is at my house right now. We were just sitting on the couch looking through our selfie hall of fame. Silly selfies, serious selfies, sad selfies, the list goes on and on. She has more selfies on her phone than I can even remember taking.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;"I'm thirsty" she says, "I'm going to get something to drink"

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I keep looking through our selfies. Swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe. Wait. What was that? Go back. What is that? You can see it in the windows reflection. Shes holding something behind me. That's odd. That isn't in our routine. I shrug and keep swiping.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, wait

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;There it is again. You can see it in the TV's reflection now. What is she holding? Does she always do this? It's a little closer to me than it was last time. I've never noticed it before. She has never mentioned it before. I should ask her about it when she comes back.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;You can see it in the mirror now. The mirror isn't like the window or the TV. It's much, much more clear. I see what it is now. I see what shes holding behind me. Its a knife. A big, sharp, metal knife. And its getting closer.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I don't think, I act. I grab her purse and rifle through it. Makeup, phone charger, book, ...my heart stops. There it is. Buried at the bottom of her purse. Chills shoot down my spine. I pick it up. The metal is ice cold. The blade is razor sharp. I can't take my eyes off it. I am petrified. I am terrified.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Shes coming back. Quick, bury the knife back in the bag. Put her purse where she left it. Don't let her see, she can never know.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Every step is louder than the last. Faster! Quietly! She can never know.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Shes almost here. 

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Pick up the phone. Stop breathing so quickly. Sit still. Dont look up. She just outside the doorway now. I can see her shadow moving closer.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Shes back.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;"Ready to take a selfie?"

 You're going to need to speak up, this nice *SHINY* trophy is making a lot of noise. 




 Whats that? Sorry I can't hear you over this nice shiny Lombardi trophy. 




 ...perfect spiral! 




 Because the Patriots have in fact struggled with defense many years. Either way, no team will win without a balanced team. Of course you need more than just a good quarterback to win games, but that doesn't make the quarterback any less awesome. 




 No, not really. LeBron is thought of as one of the greatest to ever play the game of basketball, regardless of things outside his control. Sherman isn't even necessarily the best in his position today. On top of that he's very arrogant. That being said, hes still very, very good and one of the best cornerbacks out there right now. 




 Richard Sherman (Seattle) and Darrele Revis (New England) are arguably the two best cornerbacks in the NFL. Them going head to head in the Super Bowl has been the cause of a lot of media attention. Tom Brady (New England) and Sherman also met once in the regular season. At the end of the game, after the Seahawks won, Richard Sherman approached Brady and said "You mad bro?". Hes known for being very arrogant and pretty full of himself.

Fast forward to the Super Bowl today. Sherman again openly taunted Revis after a blown play when he mocked his number '24' at the camera. Then the Patriots came back from a ten point deficit in the final quarter (something that has never been done in NFL history). They end up 4 points a head. Seattle look like they're about to score one final time with less than a minute left, which would have given them the lead and almost certainly the victory. Instead of safely running the ball though, Seattle elected to throw it and the Patriots came up with a miraculous interception that gave them possession of the ball for the last minute of the game. Theres a gif of Richard Sharman watching this play, he goes from all smiles as a Super Bowl champion, to completely devastated in about two seconds (it's pretty damn funny). This is him basically apologizing for being an ass, and Tom Brady respecting that. What I'm more surprised about though is whats happening outside of the picture. This was taken whils both teams got into a fairly large fight, they we're literally the only two players not fighting. I do not respect Richard Sherman as a competitor, but I very much respect him being the only person on his team not to fight and to try to make amends for being a general ass. That being said, I'm sure he would have gone right back to arrogant jerk mode if his team had won.

EDIT: By the way, LeBron James played basketball.

ANOTHER EDIT: Actually this wasn't the play with the big fight, nevermind, I'm sure he was very much involved in that. 




 Me too. I honestly thought "Fuck. Okay, they can't be stopped, just give them the touchdown with as much time as possible still on the clock"

 So many questions 




 This is very outdated, for one thing New York is 1st in the United States, San Fransisco is 2nd.

 My character is allergic to bees. Now which developer thought that was a good idea? 




 Oh my god yes, instead of grown ups handing out candy and  treats, kids could hand out beer and shots of vodka. Kids, alcohol, drunk adults, I can't think or a reason not to do this! 




 A 2003 Special Edition [Fender Splattercaster] (http://m.imgur.com/OO7zCTv), its beautiful! I got it for about $350 a few years back, and I think that was an awesome deal. The last big special editions Fender did before that was the [Bowling Ball series] (http://m.imgur.com/eYCoxzH) which go from anywhere between $3000-$7000 these days. Hopefully ten years from now mine will be worth the same! Not that I would ever consider parting with it. Ever.

I also have an 11.something carat piece of uncut Tanzanite. I'm not married or anything, I got it from an Aftican warlord I met while in Tanzania. We weren't close, he either had no idea how much it was worth, or he was *really* trying to impress me (which didn't work, I didn't know it was worth anything until I was back home for a few years). Fast forward 15 years and the Tanzanite mines are going dry and the price is skyrocketing. I plan on selling it 7-10 years down the road when the market is completely under supplied . Right now Tanzanite is worth about $700 a carat, but an appraiser told me that it's price could triple in a decade. Maybe I'll be able to but another Splattercaster! 




 Damnnnnnn 




 Yeah I would. 




 But why??? 




 Holy fuck. 




 No, but seriously. 




 What?

 




 Um, no results. 




 That...was very risky. 




 What? 




 Whoa... 




 I'll save time from Googleing this one and just assume that's what I think it is. 




 Well that Google was well worth it.  




 I once saw my friends sister laugh really hard and have 'milk' come out her nose after leaving the bathroom at Six Flags. We weren't drinking milk. Or anything. I wonder...

 Um, okay. Go on? 




 What it lacks in NSFWness it more than makes up for in weirdness... 




 ...what? 




 Whoa, I might consider a throwaway on that one. 




 Holy shit I just got a great idea... 




 So...you're not okay with it at all?... 




 Well, as it tuns out, there is a very NSFW comic book based around a 'superhero' called test_subject3655. From what I can gather, he has the power to stop time which he utilizes to fuck this same person over and over again. It might be rape, can you give consent if time is stopped? Can you fuck when time is stopped?... Its a little hard to tell because there are a few Asian words thrown in here and there-now that I think about it this sounds like something Japan would create. It is anime after all. 




 Um, the whole point of this is for 'secrets' that aren't really a big deal. If it's a big deal don't post it here...obviously. 




 Phew, glad that's cleared up. The way you worded that kinda made me think you were shitting your pants on the regular and that your 'wife' was a guy.

EDIT: 'Phew' 




 Thanks for clearing that up. 




 I had no idea this was a job.

 Ah, the great plight of the grey...

To press, or not to press-that is thy question:

Wether tis' nobler to supress

Thy temptation of the button,

To bear witness to other's vibrant blues and greens

Heedful I'll never be blessed with one of my own,

Or take arms against a sea of buttons,

And by opposing end them? To hold: to press;

No more; and by a press to say we end

The heartache the thousand natural shocks

That flesh is heir to,

'Tis a consummation

Devoutly to be wished.

Alas...

Once more into the fray,

Into the last good fight I'll ever know.

Press and repress on this day.

 No wonder we let that colony go

Oh boy, so many corrections needed in just one statement. First of all it was not just *one* colony, but rather thirteen. Second, -well, tell me, when Birtish peope 'give' things away, do they always lose thousands of lives in the process? Because if not, the British didnt so much *give* those thirteen colonies away, as had they them taken away. By force. By most accounts an international embarrassment. Not only that, but they failed to retake those measly thirteen colonies (now states) just a few years later. But you're English, so I'll *give* you the benefit of the doubt (see what I did there? No? Read it again, a little slower this time).

 No. Sneak peak is where you get really high up on a mountain or a peak or something so you can spot the spoilers ahead. I believe it gets its name from Tikaboo Peak (sounds a lot like *peak*aboo, right?), in Nevada, where thrill seekers and conspiracy theorists alike will occasionally scale the barren wasteland to *sneak*  a *peek* at the near by Area 51. Get it? They're *sneaking* a *peek* on a *peak*... With a name like 'stealth mountain' I would have expected you to know this. Since then, the term 'sneak peak' has evolved into a few different meanings. The most popular among them meaning 'to get an early look at something that has not yet been released to the public'.

In this instance, I scaled my very thick pile of A Song of Ice and Fire books to catch a glimpse of future spoilers. The expedition was worth it, countless wonders lie at the summit. Unfortunately, all of that hard work is going to become obsolete in about ten weeks. I feel like a librarian. I just spent the last few years of my life sorting metaphorical books (and a few literal books actually), but as soon as I'm done with my life's work the Kindle comes around and suddenly all of my hard work is purposeless ancient history. Oh look, I'm ranting.

Anyhow, that's what 'sneak peak' means.

 [My favorite part] (http://i.imgur.com/rEbTrQP.png) 




 This literally happened to me once. Me and my friend were hot boxing his car, both at at least a [7] when he checked his phone and said, "Dude! Awesome news!". Oh, how wrong he was. Apparently he had just gotten a text from a girl he was trying to hook up with. She was at an 'ice cream social' and she wanted us to come join. Now at the time this did sound like awesome news. *An ice cream social!* I thought, *I've died and went to stoner heaven!* We drove off in pursuit of the delicious ice cream that awaited us.

On the way there my friend pulled into a church parking lot. Yes, a church. I didn't say anything out loud, but in my head I questioned this. *Had he made a wrong turn? Were we turning around?* Alas, we were not. Apparently, this was where the ice cream social was being held. It was at this point that I began to get worried. I almost didn't go in, but he had already told the girl we were coming, and as a bro I couldn't send him in alone. I retrospect, I totally could have and definitely should have.

Immediately upon entering I recognized many of the people there from my school. I realized I had no idea what type of group this was, so I decided to ask the girl we came to see. "Wait, he didn't tell you?" she says, "This is my churches youth group" Fuck. Fucking fuckity fuck fuck fuck fuck. Before I had time to burst out of the front doors an old woman summoned all of us to the center of the church in some sort of religious pow wow. No no no. Must. Leave. Now. Must. Find. Friend. Too late. He's already sitting down. FUCK. I run over and grab the seat next to him, all the while begging him to rush the exit with me. Again, too late. The room was silent, the old lady was taking roll call.

"Brian"

"Here"

"Sarah"

"Here"

"Kevin"

"Here"

Shes reading from a list. Thank god. Maybe she won't even notice us. Nope. That would be too easy, wouldn't it? Instead she says, "Oh! And I see we have some first timers here! Care to introduce yourself?" *FUCK NO, EVIL RELIGION LADY!!* I was high, don't judge me.

There was a silence. A silence that lasted much, much, much too long. I looked at my friend, and he looked back at me, both preying the other would answer. And then he did something that I will not forgive him for to this day. He reached in his pocket, and pulled out his phone. Instead of answering, he flipped open his phone and started texting away. I looked up. Old Lady McGee was staring directly into my eyes. I had to speak.

"Uh, hi. My name is test_subject3655"

Someone laughs. *Fuck youuuuuuuuuuuuu.* She smiles. "And why are you here today, test_subject3655?" she asks.

What?! This is a fucking interview?? I glanced back at my friend, still texting away. Shit, I was alone on this one. *Fucking hell!!! Wait, you're in a church, don't think stuff like that.* Again, I was pretty fucking high. "Um, yeah I think I just came for the ice cream." Silence. Complete, dead, silence. Not even a comforting cricket chirping away, utter silence.

"...alright." she says, before mercifully moving on to some other topic. We sat through another half hour of this before making a break for the door. Everyone knew. EVERYONE. Even Old Lady McGee probably knew. Never, ever ever again. Ever, ever, ever.

**TL;DR: Went to an ice cream social high as fuck, turned out to be a church youth group, got interviewed by an old religious lady in front of everyone.**

 I don't understand why 'liquid cheese' is such a big thing to foreigners, its not the least bit popular here. I've seen it maybe two or three times in my entire life, I don't even know where to find it to be honest. Its not something they just sell in the grocery store. I think you would have to special order it on the internet or something. Maybe 7 11.

 /r/humblebrag 




 I actually hate Five Finger Death Punch, this is an unbiased opinion. The fact that they're a heavy metal band is almost irrelevant, they play the song as rock. And there is absolutely no screaming, the closest they get would be the harmony during the chorus I guess. But like I said before, a piano isn't an instrument that can capture the message behind this song. There are many other songs where it can, but not this one. The Doors or Styx are good examples of song writing and composition that is perfect for a piano componet. Bad Company (the song, not the band) isn't. Its simply too mild where the song is too rugged. Kind of like playing Back in Black with a ukulele. Sure you can do it, and it will probably sound pretty cool too, but it will never compare to the raw power and passion behind the orginal song.

None of this means Bad Company is a bad original song, just that it could be better.

EDIT: Not sure why you're down voting me over a petty debate... When it comes down to it its an opinion, you shouldn't despise someone just because you disagree with them. 




 25/8/361

FTFY 




 I disagree, while it might ruin the mood of the orginal tempo, it captures the essence of the song much, much better. Its a song about breaking away from societal norms and rejecting modern customs (with regard to aggression mostly). The original version dosnt capture that at all. Five Finger Death Punch's does a much better job conveying that message and in a much more powerful way. Bad Company isn't a simple easy going song, its powerful and gritty and rugged. Where Bad Company missed the mark, Five Finger Death Punch nailed it. 




 [Bad Company] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=u_VsvZmIWxY) by Five Finger Death Punch. Oddly enough, Bad Company by Bad Company is a little bit of a let down after this version.

Also the Jimi Hendrix version of [All Along the Watchtower] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TLV4_xaYynY). Devlin and Ed Sheeran did [a cool cover of that too] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iDRJwCSEcoA). A cover of a cover. Coverception.

[Fall Out Boy] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sk8Pb17pcQI) and [Alien Ant Farm] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CDl9ZMfj6aE) both did surprisingly awesome Michael Jackson covers.

 Oh boy, you caught me at a good time. So my dad has this thing that builds up a about a metric shit ton of air pressure. Its made for powering nail guns, but can be used for all sorts of things. They didn't really put a responsible limit on the machine because they didn't really put a respinsible limit on the wild number of attachments you could hook it up to. Theres one for blowing around pressurized air, one for power washing, you name it.

Anyhow, I was supposed to clean the front walk way today. My walkway is made up of a bunch of stones with no cement in between. Shit gets stuck in there and its almost impossible to get out. I was generously given the air cannon to cleanse those hard to reach cracks. It started out just fine. I pumped it up to a shit ton per square inch, and we were off. Everything was effortlessly coming out, no ammount of dirt and leaves could stand in my way! And then I got bored. I decided to crank the pressure up another half shit ton. I distinctly remember saying, "Let's see what this baby can do!" Oh, how I would regret those words.

I started aiming the little pressure gun thingy around my yard to see how far it reached. About 25 feet for those of you wondering. It was shaped kinda like a realish gun, so it was pretty fun. Suddenly someone shouted, "Hey!" *Shit!* I thought, *did someone just catch me really embarrassingly playing with fucking air?!* Accept I didn't even get those rational thoughts together. I just turned to face my accuser. Fun fact, sometimes when you're surprised your muscles tighten and tense up. This can be especially bad if you're holding anything dangerous, like, say an air cannon. Before I knew it, a shit ton and a half square inches of pressure hit my brother directly in the balls at point blank range. It very literally blew him away. I mean he had some decent hang time considering how many steps he had to go down. Unfortunately for him, he didn't even have the weeds in the cracks of the bricks to comfort his fall.

He just got back from the hospital and apparently were telling everyone he got hit by a base ball from a rouge pitching machine. Only me, him, my parents, my neighbors gardeners, the lovely doctors at Widmore Medical and my friends will know the truth. Oh, and now the internet I suppose. Shhh.

**TL;DR I hit my brother in the balls with an air gun pumped up to exactly one and a half shit tons per square inch of pressure. Recently released from hospital, no permanent injuries. If you don't count pride.**

 I actually spend a lot of time in Wisconsin, I was just in Milwaukee two weeks ago (complete coincidence, I still don't live there). One time I actually met Hulk Hogan in the Milwaukee airport, bandana and all. It was weird, we had a very normal conversation. At no point during our 13ish minute chat did he nor I acknowledge that he was a fairly famous celebrity. He just sat down next to me, asked me to pass the news paper, and we talked about the headlines for a while. So to answer your question, its pretty nice this time of year. 




 Yes, they absolutely did, but Halloween itself is a Christian holiday. Of course there were other influences. I guess I don't really see what your arguing here, Halloween is a Christian holiday just like Samhin was pagan. Historians today aren't really sure where Halloween itself originated, although there are many possibilities, Samhin among them.

Of course many Christian traditions come from other influence, whats your point though? Halloween is simply not celebrated in paganism, period. Nor any other religion. Hence 'completely Christian'.

EDIT: For the record, the term 'a completely Christian holiday' does not at all mean that there isn't other influence in it, nor does it imply it. 




 Yeah but...its fact. What is there to disagree with? And ambiguity of history? 




 Awww. Gracias, I'll fix it. 




 I canged it three times. Started with intents and purposes, changed it when someone said that was wrong, changed it back when I realized he was wrong. The first change was about two minutes in though, so no edit asterisk was added, the second edit was when I put in the EDIT. To be honest, I didn't see your comment until well after.  




 It doesn't change in quoted text...

Gotcha.

Try it.

I think the edit was the part with EDIT next to it. 




 Usually I skip straight to step two. I like to stay ahead of the game. 




 Reunion potentially revived? 




 Nope, [this one] (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/33yg8j/what_are_some_unusual_things_your_parents/cqpm5jw) takes the cake. 




 Well no, not necessarily. That's definitely a possibility, but the origin of Halloween is still debated. Some think it was from Samhain, some think Pomona, or even Parentalia. No one really knows where it came from, but Halloween itself is a completely Christan holiday, regulardless of what holiday preceded and maybe even inspired it.

EDIT: Downvotes? I don't really mind, but why? 




 Although more of a commercial thing now, Halloween is 100% a Christian holiday. Its an evening of feasting to remember the dead (hence it's being called the day of the dead in places like Mexico), particularly dead saints (hallows). Costumes and fun was a way to approach the sad topic of death more lightly. And the 'scary' aspect of Halloween come from farmers and people dressing up to scare evil spirits away from their harvest. The entire holiday is essentially Christian though... If I were you I would tell them about it, just to see what they thought. 




 Thats so sad, some of my favorite memories are playing outside with neighborhood kids :( 




 Were you an only child? I feel like this couldn't even be enforced any other way. 




 Fucking fuck you... I don't even know what that is, I noped out after the word 'urethral'. The picture didn't help either.

 I know a few people who didn't touch alcohol until they were 21.

Before you go out for a big bash on your 21st birthday, maybe test the waters in the shallow end.

EDIT: I realize how few people this applies to, I mean thats an ungodly amount of self control, but this is for the good kids don't deserve embarrassment like that. 




 Not really, they just didn't get along together at all. They were both really nice to everyone else.

[I found out the hard way] (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2tra31/whats_the_biggest_secret_you_would_share_without/co1s2h8?context=3). Anyhow, I guess thats what I'd be into. 




 In middle school, the quiet kid, Steven, had an arch rival. Robbie. In class Robbie always seemed to come out on top of their little scuffles, mostly because Steven couldn't really formulate or execute a 'burn' or 'comeback'. He just rolled over and let Robbie get his insults in until the teacher stepped in. One day I was walking behind Robbie after that class and Steven quietly crept up behind him. Before Robbie could even turn around, he got as close as possible and said, "If I was to come into your house and kill you while you were sleeping, I doubt anyone would even notice..." then he disappeared into the darkness of the science hallway. I don't remember the exact words, but the was pretty damn close. I was about 55% shocked, 30% laughing hysterically on the inside, and 15% terrified. Robbie never made fun of ol' Stevie again.

EDIT: Yippie, new top comment! Thanks, Reddit :) 




 I once won one (once won one...woah) of a those huge arcade prizes at the amusement park. Never have I been able to return to the same level of stardom. 




 "My anaconda *does* want some" 




 Everything about that fucking sucks. 




 Kinda thought [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TQQGqQtnBk) was the kind of thing I was looking at. 




 Uh oh 




 Um, incredible? ...Its a tunnel. I mean it looks very cool, and I totally want to drive a boat over that little boat-bridge, but its just a tunnel. 




 Holy mother of god, no one is safe! 




 Every season the first four games are just horrible, then they get it together later by around week 5. I need to explain this concept to all of my non-Patriot fan friands literally every year. And I get to explain it again every December :D 




 Is it somewhere behind that pipe?

 What? I wrote that example that way intentionally, changing it doesn't make any sense. And regardless, thats an example, the point still stands. His way was kind of wrong. 




 That had some of the best reactions I've ever seen. Yellow-blue jacket guy, beige jacket man and cool-blue-sunglasses-dude are among my favorites.

 One of the best smelling strains ive seen

Thats kinda like saying, "one of the best tasting dinners I've heard" 




 I'm a decent writer, or at least I like to think I am. I've been published a few times (mostly magazine articles, nothing too major) and very often wrire short stories just for fun. I can't promise I would be that big of an asset, but if you want me take a look at what you wrote and give you my two cents, I'd be happy to help! 




 Do NOT try to read this at a [9]... You know when you're mind starts to wander while you're reading but you're eyes keep moving down the words like you're actually reading them? Well I was reading this when I decided in my head I should imagine Obama saying this like he would have on the TV show, and that made me think of my friend who can do an awesome Obama impression, and then I thought of this guy on Americas Got Talent who does really cool impressions, which lead to thinking about Howie Mandels goatee for a while, and then I thought maybe I should grow a goatee, and then I was like, "Hey, King Tut has a pretty kick ass goatee", (for some reason I said that part out loud) and that went on for a while and I came to the conclusion that King Tut and Howie Mandel would probably be really good friends, a thought which developed into a TV show staring the two ('Howie and the Tut'), a sitcom about two dysfunctional, fun loving room mates living in suburban Giza. And then I guess I read the name 'Obama' and it must have registered in my brain because suddenly Obama was in the show, and he was like the guy in the gang that no one really likes but hes still always kinda around (not necessarily unlike normal Obama) and they all went on all kinds of adventures together, like white water rafting down the Nile, and pulling pranks on ol' Vlad Putin (as I imagine Obama does in real life). And then realized that I been reading the same line over and over again for literally eleven minutes.

It was a wild ride. 




 Thanks, man.

 Me: "...wait why isn't he starting till 4:20? Thats late, the sun will almost even be going down." 




 I know less now than I did before. 




 Welp, thanks for ruining the memory of Robin Williams.

 Thats only $10 more dude. 




 What time zone do you live in in Europe? We can just do some simple math here. 




 Never not upvote this

I got a second opinion as this is not my first language. I might have maybe forgot there was such a thing as a double negative, but lets not dwell on that. Small words used in quick succession occasionally confuse me sometimes... 




 It was the right choice against the wrong team. Think about it, the Seahawks had three downs, one timeout and lass than a minute to go one yard. The best game plan here is to throw it on second
 down, then if it's incomplete run it on third, if that fails use your last time out and run again on fourth. It might have been a better idea to throw it on third instead of second, but regardless the throwing was not the problem. As a coordinator or a coach you do not account for things like interceptions or fumbles. Sure you expect them once or twice over the course of a game (three or four times if your Rex Ryan) but you don't avoid choosing a play because you think the other team is going to come up with a miraculous play. Not only that, but as good as Marshawn Lynch is, he is NOT good at running from the one yard line. In fact, he's pretty bad at it. I'll direct you [here] (http://mobile.sportingnews.com/article/4634710-nfl-super-bowl-seahawks-marshawn-lynch-one-yard-line-analysis-context-pete-carroll-call-patriots-2014). His swooping left and right with bursts of speed doesn't work from the one yard line when an entire team is running at you down the entire line. Pete Carol and his offense made the right decision, the Patriots were just in the right place at the right time.

Theres no guarantee the game would have been over after that either. Who in the right mind doesn't think Tom Brady can't get a field goal (which is all they would have needed to tie) with a minute left? Especially considering how well Tom Brady was playing that night. 




 I don't think you understand, that was a glorious moment in Patriots history. Richard Sherman, the very man who disrespected Tom Brady with his "You mad, bro?", finally got what was coming to him: agonizing defeat in the form of Malcom Butler. I have nothing against the Seahawks, Russell Wilson seems like a great guy, Marshawn Lynch is hilariously unconventional, and I'm a huge USC fan so Pete Carol is and will always be a hero in my eyes. That being said, seeing the cocky sparkle in the eyes of Richard Sherman die a little bit at that exact moment was literally the most satisfying thing I have ever seen. 




 "Yeah, sure, but fuck that guy"

No, but seriously if you think they might be dating someone, approach the topic very casually, so that just in case they do its no big deal. It also might be a good idea to go into it fully expecting that they do in fact already have an SO. Then you get to play the other role, acting surprised if they don't or cool and collected if they do. Kind of just something like, "Really? Awesome!" if they don't or, "Yeah, I kinda thought someone like you probably would" if they do. Its tough to give exact examples or recommendations though because you really have to read the situation, but I think you get the point. Good luck! 




 He pulled this one out of the bag a few times this year. Where he drops back and when the pocket starts collapsing runs through it up to the line of scrimmage and guns it on the fly. I've never seen it from him in any other season, but its fucking awesome! 




 The consumers of the North Korean economy will surely rejoice! Well, they would if I hadn't just made them up. 




 Ohhhhhhhh, I get it! Took me a while, but I'm here now!

 Good for you, I'm 27. Too bad you clicked at 52 though, huh?

 He was also in 'The Wedding Ringer' where he dropped another reference. At the end they all get on a plane and he suddenly looks all dramatic amd serious and says, "I've got a bad feeling about this flight..." Last line of the movie. 




 Yeah, I guess it could also be argued that he killed Tricia Tanaka... 




 Hurley! Wait, he hit someone with a car. Did they die? Nah, he's Hurley. 




 Ah, the fabled Cockamouse. Half cockroach, half mouse. It's about the size of a potatoe, it has antennae, a hard exoskeleton, fur whiskers and the ability to fly. It primarily inhabits apartments and hotels on the lower east side of Manhattan, but has been sighted as far away as the subarbs of New York City. As of right now, there are an unknown number of wild Cockamice, although one was known to have recently given birth. 




 Confirm or deny OP, confirm or deny. 




 Me and some friends once smoked in a big park near my town. We went down a trail and found a good spot. The park closes when its dark so after a while we got everything together and headed out. It got dark a lot faster than I had expected though, and pretty soon the trees made it completely dark (the not-quite-as-awesome kind of trees). To make matters worse, we couldn't find the way back. I had been there pleanty of times before, but for some reason I couldn't find the right trail. We went in the same circle three times. Yeah, I know, but it was terrifying. At one point ome of my friends got way ahead of us and wouldn't slow down. He was gone eventually. We finally made it out and got a call from the guy who went ahead saying he was waiting by the gate to make sure they didn't lock it while we were still in the park. We finally got out and parked close outside the park. I thought we were home clear but apparently not. A park ranger pulled us over when we were leaving and questioned the hell out of us. Almost worse than I would imagine a cop. He totally knew, and would have definitely called the cops if he could prove it. He followed us for a while too. We were in two separate cars, so we went different directions and lost him, but it was still scary as hell. 




 ...and?? 




 Pavers? Good to know! Theirs looks like [this] (http://www.resourcedir.directory/images-uploads/2014/02/08/arbel-paver-patio-landscape-pavers-design-and-installation.jpg), it really is just about as beautiful as a drive way can get. And no I'm not the least bit stoned...lol I guess I'm just really passionate about drive ways.

Also, /r/casualconversations is good for stuff like this! I think. I'm not really sure, I subscribed like two days ago, but give it a shot non the less! Good luck:D 




 Nice, but the octopus above your TV really stole the show for me. That thing is fantastic.

 "My, what strong edibles you have!"

"All the better to get baked with, my dear!"

All I could think of for some reason. Please don't judge me... 




 Good lord, please don't sneeze OP. 




 This would give me the same exact dilemma as my neighbors drive way. I know, let me explain. You see, they have no ordinary drive way, no sir. Its made up of individual stones meticulously fit together without cement like some sort of road mosaic. It looks incredible. Every time I see it I'm like, "Damn, I couldn't drive over a piece of art like that!". Same concept with the ashtray. Good job, OP! 




 As a supporter of legalization, I hope not. As a recent watcher of 'Thank You for Smoking', I would love to see a sequel. 




 At first glance I thought that said "on the outskirts of Saint Louis, Colorado". I first questioned my historical prowess, then my knowledge of geography, then I read it again. 




 The pond is behind you, genius. 




 For those of you wondering, yes this is exactly what you think it is, no you should not open it if in public. Someone should probably throw a NSFW on there too. 




 I only say this because I'm sure that not everyone did, but you MUST watch the video. It's amazing. [Link] (https://youtu.be/qkpWwnNiGgE) for lazy people who use hyperzoom (like me). 




 Whats that? 




 That would be one hell of a box cutter. 
























 As someone who recently went through the whole college application process, that looks a lot more like a rejection letter than an acceptance. The acceptance letters are nice and shiny and professional, and they usually come in huge packets for lots of papers. The rejections are just single unflattering little envelopes.

EDIT: OP follow up, did he get in? 




 Yeah, but he'll probably charge you a ridiculous amount of money for something that should have been free and bore you the whole way through it. In the end, you'll be disappointed with the outcome and vow never to return to the field of dentistry again.

 The day the music died. Him, The Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens all in a matter of minutes. So sad. 




 As much as I love JFK, he really didn't do much of anything productive as a president. Anything he started either failed or fell to the wayside. And I mean literally almost everything. He also got too personally involved in the Cold War. He was a politician trying to fight a war with the wrong goals and prerogatives in mind. Someone in charge so far outside of his element made the entire conflict a rockier road than it had to be. He really should have just let the people who knew what they were doing make the big decisions. After he was assassinated, a few things he has begun were completed by his successors as he became a martyr, but for the most part, not much went through. A great man, personally one of my favorite historical figures, but a generally overrated president. 




 could have? 




 Jimi Hendrix. Died at 27 (basically founded the 27 club) of asphyxiation. Jimi Hendrix moved to Europe and formed the Jimi Hendrix Experience in 1964. They recorded with each other for about two years all the while traveling around the continent to play with the greats. In 1966 they hit the main stream. And then, almost overnight, Jimi Hendrix became a household name. In the next four years they would play some of the most legendary concerts ever preformed and write some of the greatest songs ever recorded. Even today Hendrix's influence is clearly recognizable in modern day music. He was one of the greatest instrumentalists to ever live. And yet, he was only a mainstream success for four years. Imagine how far he could have gone otherwise. Imagine the what he could have done if he had more time. Gah, makes me sad just to think about. 




 I'm not from the US. I would definitely argue it was an American victory. In the end, the British promised to stop their attempts at native American expansion in Canada and stopped the practice of impressment on American shipping routes. In contrast, the British got almost nothing out of the war.

 Surrender might not be the technical term, but it's generally accepted that the British lost the war. 




 It has worked on multiple occasions. 




 Not even close though... 




 The Battle of the Red Cliffs: Emperor Cao Cao's army was exhausted after a series of forces marches and unprepared for battle. Cao Cao did not reguard this and pushed on anyways. After reaching a river, a spy in his army advised Cao Cao to chain his ships together to avoid sea sickness. Upon seeing the ships, the opposing army sent fire boats at the fleet. The ships were trapped and quickly caught fire. This battle marked the end of the Han dynasty.

 nbsp;

Battle of New Orleans: In an attempt to revive the failing British army, General Packenham decided to attack the military stronghold of New Orleans and gain control of the Mississippi River. Andrew Jackson and the American army were well prepared however, and the British were easily repelled. The American army took only a fraction of the losses of the British. To make matters worse, the war was already over. Although word had not reached Louisiana by this time, the Bitish had surrendered long before the attack had even begun.

 nbsp;

Battle of Watling Street: As the Celtic leader Boudicca lead 210,000 tribal warriors south, burning and pillaging along the way, she decided to launch a surprise attack on a small Roman outpost on Watling Street. About 10,000 soldiers were stationed there. The Roman's could literally see the attack coming from miles away and easily out maneuvered the Celts. They began by using crossbows at long range and then setting up a phalanx when the army got closer. In the end, the entire Celtic army turned and ran. The Romans only lost 400 compared to the Celts 80,000. Boudicca committed suicide and the chance of Celtic victory was all but destroyed in a single battle. 




 Not really... I don't know enough about the English language to explain why that would be wrong, but I can identify it.

 Can I get a TL;DR on that? 




 0 Minute War!

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War 




 I tried to do this once. Believe it or not, a 100 pound 14 year old didn't have too much authority over a 250 pound 35 year old dad. I was honestly worried he was going to charge me. Then he took two tries to get out of his folding chair and my worry dissipated. 




 I used to ref soccer, hated dealing with this. I was at a game once where a keeper took a goal kick, only to have it immediately intercepted by the other team and shot into the open net. Goal, right? That's what I thought at least, and whistled the play dead before retrieving the ball and walking it back to the center of the field. When I was half way there the coach of the team that was scored on ran up to me and started shouting that "THE GOALIE WASN'T READY, SO THAT DOSNT COUNT! TAKE THEIR POINT AWAY!". I said that's definitely not a rule, and even if it was, if he wasn't ready he shouldn't have made the decision to start the play. These are middle school kids, they know the how the game works. He had no verbal response to that. Instead he grabbed the ball from me and punted it two or three fields away. "Go get the fucking ball, punk" he said. I calmly (and quietly, and very slowly just to piss him off) explained that the home team needed to supply the equipment for each game. Field, nets, etc. And if his team couldn't provide a vital piece of equipment, say a ball, I would have no choice but to have them forfeit the game and give the other team the win. Everyone quietly watching him walk across the entire park to get the soccer ball and bring it back was the most satisfying experience I have ever been a part of.

TL;DR: Made a very reasonable call the coach didn't like, he got mad and punted the soccer ball away and told me to go get it. I told him if he didn't get it and his team, the home team, can't provide the necessary equipment, they're team forfeits and the visitors win. He retrieved it. 




 No, you're actually very wrong.

*Insult: a disrespectful or scornfully abusive remark or action*. Again, and actually serious this time, is English your first language? That would explain a lot. Your definition was a little misguided. It okay though, let's just try steering that brain cell in the right direction, champ. Anyhow, I have not once insulted someone because I wanted to hear them reply, what the hell kind of concept is that? If I'm insulting them, I'm clearly not a huge fan of hearing them speak, so why would I even want them to respond? You for example, I literally could not care less if you respond or not. Literally. The best part is though how you act like you're not trying to come up with some sort of comeback or response. Who was the one who began this whole thing by responding in the first place? Oh, right that would be you. "What have you been doing the whole time?"

And sorry to disappoint pal, but if you think anything you have done, or even can do, by commenting on Reddit is going to make me the least bit angry, you are more than delusional my friend. 




 Awwwwwwwwwww 




 "Man sneezes into tombstone during concert? Woah. Intriguing. Let's watch. Wait what? Is this a church? Well that would explain the tombstone. Wait, come on test_subject3655, whens the last time you saw a grave on the *inside* of a church? Well hold on now test_subject3655, this could be some weird religion where interior burials are common. If Scientology and the Church of the Button can be a thing, well I'll be damned if graveyards with a roof can't be one too. Either way, some guys gonna sneeze in one, they better get to it. 7 seconds to go. Woah, woah, woah hold up. What in the fucking dick was that? Was that an elephant? In the church? Why in the hell wouldn't the title mention the fucking church going elephant?! What is the title anyways?-Holy Jesus Christ I'm in idiot."

EDIT: Watched the video again. Couldn't help but to feel a little disappointed. 




 R+R=L(S)? 




 Please please please post a video of all of this. And then train my dog to do it. But seriously, the first part. 




 How does one exactly laugh at something while not paying attention to it? Do you even think before you type? You got that one lonely brain cell left, use it.

While under normal circumstances it's easy to understand the difference between insults and jokes, yours seem to be the solitary acceptation. I'll tell you what, how about you actually make your jokes *funny* and your insults *offensive*. That way not only will I understand them, but maybe we could even consider what your saying 'coherent'. This might seem like a lot to take in for a person like you, but one step at a time, bud. 




 I literally said out lout, "Holy fucking fuck", even though this isn't even really a theory, it want this theory to be true the most out of all of them. 




 I think if you're already in the car, its too late for you anyways. 




 Is English *your* first language? Because it's  capitalized, genius (I think I should explain that 'blast' for your benefit. I'm calling you a genius sarcastically. That means that I don't really think you're a genius, on the contrary in fact. I'm calling a very stupid person.)

I keep responding no because I care about (but not limited to) your opinion as I think you should probably know by now, but rather to educate your dumb ass. In my own humble opinion, it seems we shouldn't waste the single brain cell you have left. But if you would rather waste it, hey it's your brain cell to 'blast' if you insist upon doing so.

And are you still defending your incredibly messed up sexual assault joke? I stopped reading your little 'retort', and I use the term very lightly, about half way through but was shocked to pick back up and see that you were still at it. It was hard to believe you made a joke like that in the first place, but to sit here and watch you defend these actions... Despicable. I don't care if you find that sort of thing hilarious, but I certainly don't, and I think I speak on behalf of the majority of the general public when I say that so please stop saying things that degree of fucked up. Gosh, it really brings your character into question.

And don't try to explain your joke; it's never funny when you need to explain the joke. Come to think of it, it was never funny in the first place. 




 It really is the trouble makers that get away with the most. 




 Are you really joking about molesting people? And comparing it to an almost harmless joke (I say 'almost' for your benefit. The teacher didn't care, the students thought it was ridiculous. Literally no harm or even unpleasantness that could have come remotely close to coming out of it lasted even the length of that day) someone made on a teacher in middle school?? That's and disrespectful and fucked up on so many levels. And to think your trying to preach righteousness. Unbelievable.

And I'm not trying to prove your weak insult about a 'shit' wrong. I literally could not care less about your opinion. In fact, I'm getting a kick out of watching you still struggling to 'blast' me. ('Blast'?? Seriously? Jesus, how fucking old are you?) 




 The class would just be dying about how far he could go

I did actually. And even if it didn't, you just assumed these things. As we all know, when you assume, you make an ass of 'U and ME'. Or, in this case, just you. So being 'blasted' on basic reading skills is on you. Its funny that you blame me for what you thought was clearing it up later, and then went back to the previous un-cleared up hypothetical scenario you made up in your head. If you didn't get it the first, or second time, I'll say it a third. I nor anyone in that class, have naver made or laughed at a 'borderline stalker joke'. Are you still assuming things?? Read it again, slower this time. Good lord, just get it together.

 Well I would be offended, but it just seems plain silly to take egotistical internet ass holes with a superiority complex seriously. For the record, no one thought what he was saying was funny, they thought it was funny that the teacher did nothing about it. Are you honestly saying that you were never a juvenile middle/elementary school student with a slightly distorted sense of humor that probably encompassed some sort of immaturity? If you say no you either missed your entire childhood, or you're a conceited dick. If you say yes, then you should understand why a class of children would find immature things like this funny, and apparently just troll people on the internet because you have nothing better to do with your sad pathetic life. I couldn't care less about your depressing little existence though, carry on making the world a worse place for the rest of us.

 Um, no. I get why it was seem like that, but I was there, trust me it didn't go down like that. The class would always be dying at how far he could go just walking all over her and when he was done she would laugh along with the class like it was a tiny little joke and no big deal. In reality, he regularly crossed the line and went after her personal life and family. It was hilarious, but so, so wrong.

 There was a kid who would just say some ridiculous shit to this one teacher because he knew he could get away with it and just wanted to see how far it would go. He said things like, "On Christmas Eve, I'm sneaking into you children's bedrooms (she had two infant girls) and painting myself green so I can and hold them as ornaments instead of your Christmas tree" and "In the middle of the night I'm going to climb into your husband, so that when he talks you'll hear *my voice*" (he put some great emphasis on that last part), and even "I went online to 'rentaslave.com' and ordered you a nice new pair. Oh, happy Martin Luther King Day, by the way". Just some weird fucked up shit. The most shocking part though, was her reaction. She never did anything about it. Just laughed politely and said things like, "Alright, now I think that's enough now, John" all the while still smiling courteously like he had just made some chuckle-worthy light hearted jab.

 Okay, so this one is serious. Probably going to get buried, but serious none the less. Can someone (preferably not too huge of a stoner, just to avoid bias) who lives in a state where marijuana has been legalized explain how it has changed things over there and if you're in favor of the changes? And if you partake, how the system works exactly and what it's like compared to going into say, a liquor store. It just seems like such an alien concept living in a state so anti-marijuana.

 The entire 'proof' system is not only confusing, but unnecessary. It differs from country to country. In the United States, 2 proof equals 1% alcohol. That means that vodka at say 80 proof is 40% alcohol. There is really no point at all to the system. Encouraging people to do basic math I guess?

To make matters worse, the system changes in each country. What 80 proof means in the US could easily mean something completely different in another country. But in the US, 200 proof is as high as it goes. Thats 100% alcohol.

What?? I've lived in many places throughout my life, New Jersy among them, and let me set the record straight, the standards of comedy in New Jersey are absolutely no different from the rest of the United States.

For god's sake, Newark?!?

 I get sad when people hate on people who drive nice cars (I don't think I have much of a bias, I drive a nine year old Nissan and I'm very content with it). Although there are those people out there, for the most part people don't buy cars based on what others think but rather based on wether or not they personally like them. One of my best friends owns a new Corvette, it's a beautiful car. He's not rich, he lives in an apartment smaller than mine and saved up for 4 years to get it. He's not a dick on the road, he's probably the best driver I know and would never drive the lest bit recklessly leste he put his precious Chevrolet in danger. And he didn't buy it because he's materialistic, he doesn't care what others think of it, he just loves cars and is willing to invest in a hobby he cares about. Yet people still assume they know enough to judge him based on his means of transportation. I mean wouldn't it be wrong for someone judged you based on your hobby or interests? 




 Don't use car stereotypes, a shitty driver can drive any vehicle. I've seen plenty of people that think they own the road in Hondas and Nissans. 




 I'm not the least bit rich, but I live in an EXTREMELY wealthy area. I personally don't want to live in a very big house, but they impress me none the less. As a lover of architecture and exotic cars, I often drive through some of the nicer neighborhoods just to see the houses. Many of them are truly beautiful. 




 Well that's ignorant. 




 Everything is obviously hard to master, but in my opinion martial arts isn't any harder to 'learn' than most anything else. I can think of lots of things that were more challenging for me. 




 In a totally serious way, Paul Blart... It gets so much shit but I really did like that movie. No one wants to see the second with me and it's been killing me. I might just break down and see it alone.

Also any movie that is the 4th in a series. On Stranger Tides, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, you name it. Sure they aren't nearly as good as the first few, but the nostalgia, the characters, the awesomeness, it's usually enough to make a pretty damn good movie, even if it doesn't compare to the others. Any movie with Jack Sparrow or Indiana Jones is awesome in my book, no matter how shitty the story line.

 Of all the great pictures of Snoop Dogg... 




 Plentiful downvotes for that misleading hoodwinker! 




 OP strongly implies it. 
























 You're original comment regarded the mass of the Earth being crushed into a black hole. That is what I was addressing. Are you debating a different point now?

Also this comment doesn't make sense out of context. What black hole is he talking about? Does it have an original size? Either way it doesn't really support your argument. He's saying that if a black hole was crushed it would have more gravitational pull. That would just extend it's event horizon, not change the force exerted on it.

Either way everything I said earlier is still relevant. The event horizon has the exact same force on every black hole. Being outside one of a small black hole will not put you under more gravitational strain than a large one. 




 If they hit pass by each other they will probably slingshot each other away. If not, there are black holes that actually orbit one another. If they come even closer though they will collide and from a single larger black hole. It would release an absolutely insane amount of energy. They would release huge gravitational waves into space. An event like his has never been observed before. 




 Oh, I understand what your saying, but the event horizon is a fixed point that has the exact same gravitational pull on every black hole. The event horizon on a big black hole is the same as one on a small one. That could only change if the singularity of a small black hole somehow had the mass of a large black hole, which is impossible. By definition they have already reached their smallest size.

Correct me if I'm wrong but here's what I understand you saying: an extremely small black hole would tear you apart before you reached it's event horizon because it's small size provides more distance between the furthest extent of its gravitational pull and the nearest. That's an interesting way to look at it, but it's not really the way it works.

An event horizon is the point where the gravity is strong enough to prevent light from escaping. The force of a large black hole at it's event horizon is exactly the same as one from a small black hole. And the gravitational pull extending outwards from the event horizon may extend further for a large one, but the ratio for distance away to gravitational pull is directly proportional, no matter how large or small the black hole. 




 That's a subject of considerable debate. Bear in mind that this is all theory, not law. We could never actually prove any of this.

Some say yes some say no. There are actually theories that if things could be sucked into a black hole and survive, they would remain there forever. So if I star could be sucked in, it could supernova itself and created another black hole within the first, and so on, and so on. An entire solar system could be created within a black hole, an entire galaxy, an entire universe. For all we know, our universe is inside of a black hole, which could be inside of another black hole and another. And many of the black holes around use could house their own universes and universes within them. This is one of the many multiverse theories. If it is true, it could even contain parallel universes. If there are an infinite number of universes, you could eventually find one that is exactly the same as the one we live in in every way. A parallel universe.

Black holes themselves are basically a product of dead stars. So if the universe didn't contain any stars before its conception, it couldn't have had any black holes. But who knows if there were stars when all of this happened?

Based on the Big Bang Theory though, nothing existed before, or at least not enough to create a star. Following that logic, black holes could not have been around. Our universe is not even old enough to see the first 'dead' black hole. The way black holes' radioactivity reduces as it's life goes on implies that they eventually fade into oblivion. We haven't even been around long enough to see one die though!

To answer your question, nobody knows, but there are plenty of theories. 




 Your nerves would eventually become disconnected, but I would think so up until that point. It would probably happen rather quickly though. 




 No it would actually be significantly more than that. How big would you consider a baseball? Ten inches around? That's about seven times more than the black hole you used in the event horizon calculator.

And you could absolutely not stand next to such an object without feeling considerable gravitational pull, but again you would most likely not be pulled  apart until you had passed the event horizon.

Think about it this way, you are feeling the mass of the entire Earth right now. Even if you were to tunnel down into the mantle of the Earth, it's gravitational force on you would not increase (in fact it would decrease but lets not go down that tangent). Your argument seems to be based off of Earth's consolidated mass creating a stronger pull, a pull that could effect you as you got closer to it. While it would eventually do that, it would not really happen until you were extremely close to it. 




 The two don't seem mutually exclusive. You could very well be spaghettified and then crushed! 




 It goes both ways... 




 [You're the best.] (http://24.media.tumblr.com/72dfc38636c9175f78dff498af34ea2f/tumblr_mqg385B0IR1qz581wo8_500.gif) 




 Oh yes, it would be like swimming against a much much stronger current. Once you go through the event horizon though, you fall off the waterfall at the end of the river. Even if you could overcome the current at this point, there is no getting back, not matter what. Unless you could go faster than the speed of light, but that the point where the laws of physics break down so lets not go there. 




 Think about it from the prospective that at any moment, all of your problems could be instantly destroyed and rendered meaningless! 




 An event horizon the size of a baseball would be absolutely tiny. So small in fact that while it could theoretically be created, it could not occur naturally. Anyhow, depending on it's exact specifications, it's gravitational pull probably wouldn't strongly extend all that far. You would probably break up someplace within the event horizon.

Gravitational pull doesn't increase as size decreases. 




 They probably don't all get their energy the same way, there are many ways it could happen though. When two things pass they each exert a gravitational force on one another. When an asteroid flys by Earth for example the Earth pulls it significantly closer but the asteroid also pulls the Earth very marginally off of it's orbit (we're talking immeasurably small distances here). If something went by a black hole it could get it moving extremely slowly the same way. And they usually don't have an orbit to stop them, once they're moving they don't stop. The bigger the object going by, the more it would move the black hole. If a moving black hole was to eventually pass by another object close to it's size (another black hole for example), they could slingshot each other flying into space at very high speeds. 




 No, the spaghettification doesn't happen until you pass through the event horizon regardless of the black holes size. I think that was what he was referring to by 'pulled apart'. 




 If **ANYTHING** even attached to you touches it, you're done. I saw an article or something that used a shoelace as an example. If so much as an aglet slipped through, there would be no escaping. 




 I don't think so, they don't each move at the same velocity. How could that happen if say two black holes were moving away from one another? Regardless, everything is moving. The galaxy the black hole is in for example be moving, so the black hole inside of it couldn't exactly just not move while staying in the same place within it.

Either way, the general theories of cosmology, which usually follows the big bang theory, prevent there from being a center to the universe. Even though it's all theoretical, I personally don't think there is one. 




 Sorry, where? This isn't easy on an iPhone.

EDIT: Fixed.
 




 I'm not exactly sure what you mean I guess. What is the difference between dying and ceasing to exist? I don't think it matters though, you certainly wouldn't live through it. A big black hole would pull you apart just as much as a small one. If anything it would even do it faster with its extra gravity. No one knows what would happen at the singularity, but you would probably be broken down into pieces so infinitely small that we couldn't even come up with a measurement for them.

I haven't read the article you're referring to though, I could be completely 100% wrong. 




 Absolutely, we're pretty safe though. The nearest black hole is about 6,000 light years away, not close enough to ever do any damage. Even the closest stars that could potentially go supernova are far enough away to be completely harmless. Personally, I'd love to see Betelgeuse explode, but that probably won't happen in my life. Or if its already happened, I probably won't be around to see it.

What's **really** scary though are rogue black holes. As the name would imply, rouge black holes don't have much of a fixed position. They wander around the galaxy aimlessly swallowing up anything in their path. Anything unfortunate to somehow resist a black hole's intense gravitaty and get close enough to touch it's event horizon would be immediately swallowed up never to be seen again. Well that's not exactly true I guess. Theoretically, you'll actually be able to see someone go into a black hole, or at least right up to the very edge of it. As gravity slows the speed of the image escaping though, it will appear the object getting sucked in will move towards the event horizon infinitely slowly until it almost stops moving completely. Eventually, the image will fade away long before it actually disappears into the black hole. Whats really happening that you can't see from the outside is called 'spaghettification'. I've just realized how much I wrote, anyone still reading please know this tangent has gone very far from 'black holes are terrifying'.

Anyhow, spaghettification is pretty much as bad as it sounds, and not nearly as delicious. As you are standing right now, or probably sitting, your feet are experiencing stronger gravity than your head because it is closer to the source of the gravity (the central Earth). The same thing happens in a black hole but to a much much larger scale. So much larger in fact that if you were to go into a black hole feet first, you would be stretched out with your feet stretching further than your head because they are under more gravitational strain. Spaghettification. Eventually you would be stretched out soooo far that what used to be your body would now be a single file line of atoms. In theory, they would keep spreading apart until they reached the singularity, the center of the black hole. Any theories regarding what happens at the singularity have very little to base off themselves off though, so its hard to know what happens next.

There are supposedly hundreds of rogue black holes bouncing around our galaxy. Although the methods of detection are getting better, they aren't perfect. A black hole could be flying at us right now and we wouldn't even know it. Personally, I'd rather have it that way. There is nothing we can do to stop or get out of the way of a black hole, so I'd rather not know it was coming than know inevitable spaghettification was looming around the corner.

TL;DR: Supermassive black holes=scary, rogue black holes=potential spegitification for the entire Earth (but probably not :) )

EDIT: Sorry about the rogue, rouge confusion, I'm on my phone, this isn't very easy to fix.

EDIT 2: It *is* rogue! I looked it up.

EDIT 3: Thanks for the gold kindly stranger!

 The very definition of clickbait 




 Bulls/White Sox because I used to live in Chicago, Patriots because I've always absolutely loved their style of play, Penguins because I'm also a big fan of the animal and PSG because Pauleta! I started following most of these teams as a kid and it just stuck with me. 




 I have a similar rule of thumb. If it can't  be said in 5 lines of text, a call is easier. Unless there is already a text conversation in progress. 




 They instinctively lie.

 In the other side of the spectrum, milk and pineapple somehow work together amazingly just as a snack. Like deceptively good. Locanda Verde has a desert made up almost exclusively of those two ingredients. I *highly* recommend literally anyone try it. 




 /r/humblebrag 




 I regularly watch the History Channel.

I'm like a genius. 




 Wait...you guys don't do that? 




 Wtf dude you left by far the biggest spoiler uncovered. 




 Inspired by [this] (http://youtu.be/). 




 Woah, cleavage. 




 Galifinaski. Plural. 




 The one and only. 




 Last comment I posted was "You know you're famous when your dick shows up on the front page in an hour and a half".

I'm so sorry Mr. Rogers... 




 Wow, you know you're famous when your dick to shows up on the front page of Reddit in an hour and a half. 




 ...you expected sarcasm. Sarcasm is what you expected. 




 If you're trying to come up with an example of one of their badly written songs, you've chosen a terrible one. What is this supposed to prove anyways? That your weak attempt at scat was somehow comparable?

If you actually take 20 seconds to understand the lyrics, its far from badly written. I'm not even sure why you'd need to take 20 seconds though, it's pretty easy to catch them as they go by. Around the World is definitely not my favorite, even a little overrated in my opinion, but still, not sure which point of yours this supposedly backs up.

Aside from all that, why judge a band solely off one characteristic? Even if you don't like the writing, the bass work is phenomenal, Flea is one of the best there's ever been and that's simply not debatable. The guitar has kind of been all over the place, but John Frusciante who played the majority of their albums was fantastic. The newer one is okay, but he's more of a filler now. Chad Smith is obviously awesome. Extremely talented, I honestly can't think of a bad thing about him. He brings a lot of order and direction to a band that's otherwise all over the place.

Apart from the performers, the production has always been done in precise minimalist taste by a number of talented producers. Rick Ruben, Danger Mouse, George Clinton, etc. All legends. Not many can say they've had a line up like that.

I could go on, but I won't. My point is, there are plenty of bands I don't like certain characteristics about. I don't let those few flaws ruin them for me though, instead I look past them to understand what really makes them great.
The Red Hot Chili Peppers have never been about the writing. In fact they've been known for *not* being about the writing. To say they suck because their songs are badly written is like saying Bob Dylan sucks because he has a boring voice. It's completely missing the point.

Again though, what point were you trying to make with the link? 




 Nothing says hair bands like The Beatles, Pink Floyd and Michael Jackson. 




 A: That is the most inaccurate mocking of anything in the history of ever.

B: I would totally buy that single. 




 It was one of your classic 'who would win in a three way Battle Royale, James Spader with a graphing calculator, Joe Biden with a can of Febreze (Fresh Linen) or Nicholas Cage with this years Yellow Pages?' situations. 




 "Nah man, I'll take Nick Cage and a phone book any day" 




 Oh fuck you, now I gotta click

EDIT: Phew, he only did an AMA. 




 I'd say that was fairly relevant considering the part where you mentioned it...

 Porcupine, do doubt about it. 




 Did Dany ever get to Westeros?! 




 I used to have a teacher named Mr. Dangler. Mr. *Harold* Dangler. Yup. Harry Dangler. Unluckily for me, he was a second grade teacher so none of us understood how hilarious it was to have a teacher with a name like that. Anyhow I was walking by his desk when I saw something with his first name on it. "Congratulations, Harry!" or something. I couldn't hold in my giggles, this was second grade, knowing a teachers first name was a BIG deal. The next time he called on me in class, I made sure to address him as 'Sir Harry of Dangler'. We were putting on some mid evil play in class, this was perfect. Apparently when I said it he thought I understood the hilarity of his name and sent me straight to the principals office. As a newer principle, she couldn't understand how a second grader had come up with in insult like 'hairy dangler'. It probably made it a little worse when I told her I had seen it on his desk.

TL;DR: Called a teacher by his first name, got in trouble, probably go him involved in some sort of school investigation. 




 I'd rather just give you some recommendations than my favorites. You would probably like them better.

OutKast is kind of R Bish rap. [Ms. Jackson] (http://youtu.be/MYxAiK6VnXw) or [The Way You Move] (http://youtu.be/xI5NQ-0Ubfs) are both geeat.

The Heavy are awesome. Some kind of magical blend of soul, indie rock and even a little rap put together in one significantly underrated band. [Same Ol'] (http://youtu.be/4OAkUelXoVY), [How You Like Me Now?] (http://youtu.be/sVzvRsl4rEM)

Ever listen to the Beastie Boys? They're style is a little underproduced by today's standards (yes, I know, Rick Ruben. Still too 'acoustic' for today's audiences), but some of the newer mashups with them are awesome. Try [this one] (http://youtu.be/XL0YWTPDMUI) on for size.

Rage Against the Machine is probably my favorite rock-rap band. You may or may not have heard the hits, but [Guerrilla Radio] (http://youtu.be/H0kJLW2EwMg) and [Now Sleep in the Fire] (http://youtu.be/w211KOQ5BMI) are awesome too. Audio Slave is basically the same band with a different (and in my humble opinion better) singer, Chris Cornell. [Like a Stone] (http://youtu.be/7QU1nvuxaMA) isn't my favorite, but it's up there.

Redlight King is okay, he takes some pretty cool creative risks. A [Neil Young rap cover] (http://youtu.be/lGt54Ozo8LQ) for example. Not exactly a cover I guess, but still pretty cool.

How about early Snoop Dogg? Like Doggystyle early? [Murder Was the Case] (http://youtu.be/Do4fA8tONY4), [Doggy Dogg World] (http://youtu.be/En3IgstEmcU), [Gin and Juice] (http://youtu.be/0Cxr1-b6Xkc), etc. The whole album is awesome, somehow both ahead of it's time and nostalgic simultaneously. Probably my favorite by him.

I think you might like Sublime too. They have a cool chill style. [What I Got] (http://youtu.be/0Uc3ZrmhDN4) is good, [Santeria] (http://youtu.be/AEYN5w4T_aM) is better.

Bad Religion is probably one of the best-of not, *the* best-punk rock bands of all time. [American Jesus  (http://youtu.be/12kcpP-8jfM), and of course, the sacred [Los Angeles Is Burning] (http://youtu.be/BxoD9zWY9Rg). They even released a Christmas album a few years back. I would recommend it to anyone that loves punk and Christmas.

Wolfmother anyone? Awesome band, they're one of the last bands that play a lot of older classic rock styles. [Joker and the Theif] (http://youtu.be/3afXXsJwYZo) is definitely my favorite song of theirs. Literally everyone I've ever shown it to has liked it. And then theres [Woman] (http://youtu.be/GN7syX6tz18) obviously. Their entire last album was good too, 'New Crown'.

 I can not believe that I'm the 70th comment and first to even mention New Jersey. Progress. 




 Yeah...totally. But please do. 




 Yeah but the answer is really really Florida. 




 Rarely Abort Political Exchange. What ever you do, don't stop talking about politics. 




 I would place some serious bets on American Pharo. I got a hunch. 




 Thats not in A Feast For Crows. I'd be a little disappointed if I didn't already hear about this particular spoiler. 




 That would be a HUGE spoiler for them to keep a secret for this long. Very few people are even expecting it at this point. 




 "Events transpire" 




 The hype train has offered left the station! 




 ...Was I the only one that liked that joke? 




 "Are you kidding me? It's not even close, Tormund looks way more awesome! Oh wait thats you" 




 Oh shit...this cliff hanger could carry over on two separate mediums...I don't think I could take that.

EDIT: After seeing some of the theories in these comments and reading the actor quotes again, I wouldn't be surprised to see a couple huge twists instead of just one. In fact there are two I'm like 75% sure could both totally happen in that episode 10. The hype train has officially left the station. 




 Phew, what a relief! For a second there I thought her children were going to have to grow up with out a parent in this cruel unforgiving world. Nice to know she'll be coming back. 




 Are...are you not a people? What's wrong with your gold? 




 [Very intriguing...] (http://youtu.be/Km3s6COeH1o) 




 Fuck... Fucking fuck. . . Yeah, I thought that said 'no spoilers'. 




 Mail 




 That would explain the attitude you're getting from your grandma. 




 Not at all, I even got ahold of a lot of their b sides and bonus tracks to try and get into their edgier less mainstream stuff. Some of that was okay but an overwhelming majority wasn't. 




 Not even...Riders? 




 Glad we could get an expert opinion on this one. 




 Drake/Jay Z. I don't understand how they got so far. Jay Z is okay, but he has absolutely no flow, it's like listening to someone read a book. And nothing else about him really stands out as above average. Drake is just...boring. He raps about cheesy shit that gets him radio time. "Started at the bottom now we here". Really? Such a lame line that somehow became so popular. I'm getting off topic. There's a few songs by both Drake and Jay Z that I like, but they're both insanely over rated. Countless rappers out there not getting any recognition could put them to shame. 




 I like to play with little things I'm holding. I can spin and twirl my keys like a true professional. I can flip and twist my phone in the air like it's an Olympic figure skater gently gliding over the ice. I just like to toss and catch the things I'm holding. I know where you think this going but trust me, it's worse. Anyhow, I had just got out of the shower and was brushing my teeth and combing my hair. Normal morning stuff. I picked up a little Axe spray bottle and did a few toss-flips. I then decided to do an extra high toss. It was ambitious, but I was feeling good about myself. I bent down and gently sent it upwards sailing towards the heavens. It spun just inches below the ceiling, a perfect throw. I readied myself for the decent, hand out, knees bend, eyes locked. This was it, this is why we play the game. The Axe was spinning too fast to attempt a right-side-up catch, I would just need to go for the hail mary. The unpredictable spinning reception. The bottle came back down to Earth with more force than ever. Two feet away. One foot. Six inches. Contact. The bottle hit my hand held directly in front of me. The force proved greater than I had anticipate. It was enough to press the specially designed Axe release valve down, and send a fine mist of deodorant directly into my open mouth. Try and picture how dumb that must have looked. Tossing a bottle up, catching it upside down, it sprays into my mouth at point blank range. [It wasn't great for my self esteem.] (http://i.imgur.com/bjZTGSX.jpg?fb) 




 I could be invisible, but my clothes couldn't. This becomes a daring game...

 Your name suggests that you would like /r/trees. 




 I was okay with Alan, but his wife was unbearable. "We're going to take your money" First of all, 'we'? Is she doing anything at all to contribute? Second, your going to take their money? I'm sorry, weren't you generously invited here to play a game and maybe even land a spot in their big contest? You don't have to act like they owe you anything. Ug, there aren't many of them, but some people just get to me. 




 Yeah... The moon was an example but they're ahead of the game pretty much across the board. 




 Space innovation and exploration. In terms of the moon alone, only three countries have reached the moon at all (hopefully a fourth in 2017). Three! And China's was only two years ago! But the U.S. not only got to the moon, but visited it in person and returned back to Earth. Twelve Americans walked across the moon, no one else has come even close. Which kinda sucks, because the space race is over, it's not a competition anymore. 




 49 time world champs! 




 [Um...] (http://youtu.be/eIOcWZOQL5M) 




 [Fuck You] (http://youtu.be/pc0mxOXbWIU) CeeLo Green

The best example in my opinion. Not because it's the best song, it's definitely not, but because the tone and the message are so far from each other.
