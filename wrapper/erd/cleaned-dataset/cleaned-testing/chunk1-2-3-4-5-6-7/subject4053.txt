 When I was a kid, My family (consisting of my mom, dad, twin sister and myself at the time) lived in the country and so we lived in a couple of old farm houses over the course of about 18 years. 

The last house we lived in sticks with me though. Not only was there a ghost dog in it (you could hear the sound of a dogs claws clicking on the hardwood floor and the sound of a dogs tail hitting the corner of the doorways as it wagged it's tail) But there were lots of rumors floating around about the woods we lived around. 

As you can imagine, being the only two kids, my twin sister and I were little Hellions.(the oldest of our two younger brothers wasn't born until we were 4. 

Anyway, so because we lived in the country, we were pretty much allowed to do whatever we wanted, so long as we took our whistles (this was back before cellphones were a thing) and so long as we were back before dark. 

Fast forward to being about 10 years old, My sister and I had some friends over for the weekend, my sisters friend Jade and her brother Andy and a girl called Silvette.  Being 10 (and it also being close to Halloween at the time) we all decided it would be a good idea to walk around the woods just as sunset was coming. Y'know, freak ourselves out every time we heard an owl or heard a fox bark. Silvette was a total city girl, so it was a lot of fun to freak her out (my dad and her dad worked together and her parents and my parents would get together to hang out)

Anyhoo, I remember us walking through the woods, we'd gone pretty far, when all of a sudden, Silvette says "Hey guys, let's go check out that spooky old house" 

I think all of the rest of us said "What house?". 

You see, we'd found ourselves on the treeline of this field that was behind our property. Silvette points ahead and goes, pretty persistantly "THAT house"

The rest of us look (I remember this beyond anything to this day) there was no house. 

Silvette gets mad, thinking we're picking on the city girl again and storms back into the woods towards out house. So to keep her from getting lost, we follow her back. 

Later on that week, my sister and I went back through the woods to the field we'd found, and there was indeed a house, but it had been burned to the ground at some point and was just a pile of ash and broken glass.  




 The old farmhouse I lived in as a child had a ghost dog in it, It was several years before we actually got a dog and occasionally, you could hear the sound of a dogs claws clicking on the hardwood floor in the hallway upstairs. Every once in a while, you could also hear a slight thumping sound (which as I found out after we had a living dog) sounded like a dogs tail thumping the corner of the doorway as it wags it's tail. I was pretty young, but I can still remember those moments.  




 They're just playing, that's how they learn, that's also why it's *never* a good idea to give kittens away at 5-6 weeks old. between the ages of 5-9 weeks, they learn bite inhibition, they learn how rough they can and can't be. 
























 Completely unrelated, but he reminded me of what my grandpa used to say. He was born and raised out West. 

"On windy nights, listen to the wind, if you hear the door rattle more than twice in a row, don't get up, don't speak and whatever you do, don't check outside, because thems the dead, tryin' to trick you and once you let them in, they never leave, and not all of em is nice" 




 Yeah, this isn't as gruesome as the title says. 

I was talking to my sister earlier and we were remembering some of the stuff from when my grandma was alive. 

My grandma was born in 1936(she died two years ago) 

There was a story I remember her telling my sister and I once that goes something like this. 

When my grandma was a little girl, about 7 or so years old. Her dad found a scrawny little black dog. My grandmas dad according to her, was a big, tough guy that had a soft-spot for dogs, so he brought it home. 

My grandma said that this little dog was really weird, it just walked around looking at everything or sat there staring into space, didn't bark, didn't play, and it barely ate, so it always stayed skinny. She also said it stunk constantly, no matter how many times they bathed it. 

About a year after they found the dog, it got kicked by one of their horses (mind you she said this was a little terrier sized dog) Well, the dog simply got up, shrugged it off and walked away, when they checked the dog over, it had no broken bones at all. 

A couple of years later, her mom accidentally ran the dog over with her car and the dog "died" so her dad took the dog out into the woods and buried it in a shallow grave and put a couple heavy branches over the grave so nothing could dig the dog up. 

Two days later, they came home from church to find the dog sitting on their porch, covered in dirt but otherwise perfectly fine but after that, continued to stink like rotten meat, she said. 

It got so bad that they had to keep the dog tied up outside. 

The dog got attacked by a coyote and had it's eye punctured and one of it's ears ripped off. It acted like it didn't even phase it. 

My grandma said that this little dog lived well into her young adult years (from the time she was about 7 to the time she was 20 or 21

During that time,  she said the dog had been shot twice, ran over again, kicked by two more horses and quilled by a porcupine. 

It survived each event as if nothing happened. 

She said the dog ran off when she moved out of her parents house and she never saw it again. 

Edited for a couple spelling oopsies*** 




 I'm actually not entirely sure about that. I know Slenderymans started out as a croopypooster. But I can, to this day, remember having a dream when I was younger, It was one of those realistic dreams, of walking past the steps which led downstairs of my old house, at the bottom of the stairs, there was a bathroom to the right. In the dream, I remember looking down and seeing a tall, white skinned figure with no face staring up at me. It scared me so much that I woke up bawling. 

A friend of mine told me several years later, that he had had the exact same dream while staying over at the house one weekend. I had never told him about my dream.

and this was many, many years before Slenderman even became a thing.  
























 Dude....

I get it....She said "I think I'm done now" because she was done killing o-o.

People like that fascinate me. I mean, what in the world possesses them to do something like that? What was so traumatic or heartbreaking in their lifetime that they felt the need to kill? 

I've been pretty broken before, I've been downright pissed at people who'd hurt me, but I never wished them dead, nor would I ever attempt to kill them.  




 She never said whether it ever actually died or not. 

But she did say that her mother claimed to see it several more times, standing in their yard years after it ran off,just standing there, staring into the window, only to go and get my grandmas dad and find that the dog was gone.  




 Can you imagine waking up and realizing you're not asleep anymore? =O

Happened to me this morning. and Yesterday and pretty much every day since the day I was born =( 
























 Nope. 


Nopenopenope. 

Dead people freak me out anyway and I am terrified of zombies, even if it wasn't a zombie, that would have been the first thought that popped into my head, I would have promptly emptied my bowls and bladder simultaneously and learned to fly real quick.

Because my feet would not have touched the floor once as I booked it the hell out of there o-o.  




 Yeah, do let us know what they say. I'm sure there's a few details of the story that I've forgotten but I told it to the best of my memory, which is usually pretty good and considering that this story put me off  little black dogs for years, it's one I remember the best lol.  




 Well, fortunately, unlike some people, I don't waste my time writing fictional stories ^_^.  
























 There are actually some people that can smell pregnancy hormones. 

They know someone is pregnant because they give off a slightly different natural smell. 

I was like that when my ex GF was preggers, I could just "tell" she was pregnant before she even found out. 

Unfortunately, what I was not able to tell was that the child wasn't mine. o3o

 Why not? =O

I thought it was pretty creepy o3o 
























 Seriously? How about being less of a dick than you are now.  




 This one sticks out to me.


So when I was younger, I had this friend whose house was down the road from me. So I could literally walk there in a few minutes.

His house was this big, old Victorian style house that had been painted mostly red with a red shingle roof, we always joked and called it the barn house. 

The two scariest locations in his house was his basement (this big, stone walled, dirt floor cellar) and his attic, which you couldn't actually get up into unless you accessed it through a hatch on the roof. 

So being good friends, I would stay at his house for days at a time, even on week days when we had school because we got on the same bus and him being an only child, I felt bad for him having no one to hang out with. 

His attic was super scary because every once in a while, you would hear what sounded like someone walking around in big, heavy work boots that would walk from one end of the attic to the other. 

But his basement was even scarier, it only had a single light which hung from the center of the room, it was one of those pull chain lightbulbs. So it barely lit the room up. 

Sometimes, at night, if you went into the kitchen, and if the door leading down to the basement was open, you'd be compelled to glance down into the darkness and sometimes (both of us as well as several of my friends cousins and some of our other friends had seen it as well) would see what looked like a tall figure wearing a cloak, standing at the bottom of the stairs. 


Maybe the most memorable thing, though was when he found an old tape deck in the basement, the kind you could record tapes on, it wasn't a small tape recorder, it was one of those big things. Anyway it had a couple tapes with it, so one weekend while I was staying the night, me and him were playing around with it and recording ourselves having "interviews" with each other, stupid kid things. 

Well, we then decided to erase the tapes and record ourselves sleeping, as he had decided to sleep in the living room with me. I think we wanted to see how many times we snored or something like that, I can't quite remember. 

So we settled down and set the recorder on the table and eventually fell asleep. 

The next morning, we listened through about two hours worth of recording, about 15 or so minutes of us talking back and forth before we finally fell asleep, and almost two hours in, very near the end of the tape, we heard this single, quiet, raspy voice that was so low you could barely hear it. It said something along the lines of "They're sleeping. Yes, they're sleeping. We shouldn't disturb them. Not tonight, we wait."

I remember the voice sounded something inhuman, it sounded almost like what Gollum sounds like in Lord of the rings, but much raspier and quieter. 

It's one of those things that still sends shivers down my spine, and I wish one of us still had the tape.  




 Well, given that hell is not a real place, nor is heaven, they are both just concepts of the mind. If you believe that you are going to the biblical version of hell when you die, then that is where the remains of your sub conscience takes you. Same with the biblical version of heaven.

However, I heard tell of a friend of my grandmothers, who was deathly afraid of clowns (if you can imagine a 90 year old lady terrified of clowns lol) several days before she died, she would scream "Don't let the clowns take me there!" So I can only imagine that her version of "hell" was full of clowns. 
  
























 She did, actually, which, thinking about it, makes it even more creepey.  She moved from Nevada to Ohio to live with her sister. She never talked about it again that I know of, we sort "lost touch" after she moved, AKA my father thought she was insane and didn't really want her around or talking to us, even though he saw what we all did and just passed it off as an aggressive stray dog. 

She's actually still alive, but she's in her 90's now. I've thought about calling her before and asking about what happened more, but I don't want to cause her to have a heart attack or something o-o.  




 That's creepy o3o. I love the Navajo culture but I never got too deep into the spiritual side of things their lore and their beliefs etc. 

I did, however, forget one bit. 

Apparently, up until my grandmother moved. She called my mother several times in hysterics, saying that "Yenaldlooshi is outside" or she'd leave messages saying "I'm not safe here, I have to leave. I will talk to you soon"

I don't remember that, I had to ask my mom about it. My mom doesn't even like to talk about it. 

I do remember that apparently, several of my grandmothers neighbors also saw the same, large black dog over the course of several weeks.  




 I don't have any kind of video chat or anything, nor do I have skype, but I do wanna share this story. 

My grandmother on my mothers side has always been very Superstitious, for lack of better word, she's not religious, but she does believe in a lot of paranormal stuff. 


Her mother was full blooded Navajo and her father was Irish. Either way, she'd never been anywhere East of Montana and she grew up in Nevada. 

One year, when I was in Gradeschool, we went to visit her, most of the visit was pretty uneventful, typical boring old people stuff, except she always kept her curtains drawn shut and would always peek out the window and when someone asked what she was doing, she would simply reply " Yenaldlooshi is watching me" 

This went on for nearly the entire visit until a few days before we were due to leave, My grandma and my (then) baby brother (he's 19 now lol) were in the front yard that evening, planting flowers when all of a sudden, my grandmother starts shouting "*Insert little brothers name here* get away from that creature! It's not safe!" of course, being in Nevada, we all assumed that my brother had found a scorpion or a rattle snake, so we all run outside, to see my Grandmother clutching my little brother and shaking in terror against the side of the house, standing out in the yard, was a large,black, great-dane sized dog, it was staring at my grandmother with an intensity I'd never seen before. It looked up at us, gave a little huff and bounded off, I don't remember if it moved unusually fast or not, but  do remember it had really deep yellow eyes. 

When my mother asked my grandmother what had happened, she kept repeating " The Yenaldlooshi has found me". She moved a couple weeks after that.
