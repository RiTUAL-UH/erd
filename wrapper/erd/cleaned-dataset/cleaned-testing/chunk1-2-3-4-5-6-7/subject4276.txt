 As a part of my get healthy plan, I'm quitting soda completely for a month (I'm only assuming that's how long it will take for me to not crave it, but really I want to quit until it's not something I want to drink every day) and then after that I'm limiting myself to one, per week MAX, whether it's at home, out and about, or at a restaurant. Otherwise my drink of choice is water.

Over the last few months I let myself go and I pretty much stopped taking care of myself and drank a LOT of soda. Before I was always good at drinking it only in moderation but now every time I drink it I just feel like a fat unhealthy piece of crap. So no more soda!

What are some other healthy drinks I can have? I have a hard time trusting anything from a grocery store...everything is loaded with sugars nowadays... 




 I play WordFeud with my wife because it's something that doesn't really require a huge time investment and we can be going about our daily lives and get notified when it's our turn. then I thought, how cool would it be to have a turn based game similar to Final Fantasy I can play but be able to take a turn and then go about my business. Does such a thing exist? 




 Today I went to the dentist for the first time in 2 years. I got married 2 years ago and up until a year ago I didnt know I could still be on my parents insurance. After that I just kept forgetting to make an appointment. I hardly ever brushed or flossed my teeth but today the dentist informed me I have no cavities. He seemed frustrated because of my lack of dental hygiene and yet my teeth were perfectly fine?

What about you Reddit? 









 And I ended up using every single cable 




 Or did they for some reason remove the option to turn that off from swifkey x? 

If so that's annoying because I always end up typing too fast and delete words while I type. 














 When you click on a link to imgur, if it isn't a link to an album, and it isn't a direct link to the image, I wish that the app would load the direct link instead. Landing on imgur's site on my phone gets annoying a lot. 









 For me it's the light and fan switch in my bathroom. They are swapped. The fan switch is closest to the door and the light switch is furthest from the door. Since I spend more time in my house than anywhere else, I am now trained to flick the furthest switch to turn on the light and now when I visit friends and family I turn the fan on by instinct because I forget that everywhere else is the opposite of my bathroom. 














 He said he'd mostly be using his new PC for gaming but he also said he'd be working with things like the CryEngine 3 devkit. I know that the logical cores for hyperthreading is really only useful for encoding, but I don't know much about the CryEngine devkit. Would someone really benefit from the logical cores in the 2600k for that purpose? 



















 And why did they make the chat pad incompatible with the older style headset controllers? 

I personally find the headsets to be annoying since the volume and on/off switch have to be dangling I stead of just being attached to the controller. With the newer headsets you have to take your hand off the controller to turn the mic on or off which is incredibly frustrating and distracts from the game. If someone walks into the room and wants to talk to me in the middle of the game I can't just easily turn the mic off. 

I'd like to buy the chat pad for messaging but what's the point if I have to use one or the other? WHY MUST MICROSOFT FORSAKE ME SO? 




 I've tried setting up security on my Buffalo router but it seems like every device I own will drop and reconnect every 10 minutes or so which is really aggravating. I've never had this problem with my wifi being open though. I know I can filter approved MAC addresses but I don't want to alienate anyone who comes over with their phone or laptop and want to use my wifi. I don't want to have to find out every MAC address from people who come over, and not all of them are even tech savvy so that's not the best solution.

So now I've come to want to troll the people who are using my wifi. I don't know who's doing it because I don't interact with my neighbors too often. I thought about setting up something where they can pay $10/mo per computer they connect with that goes to my paypal, but the paranoid in me thinks they will complain to the ISP that I'm reselling their service and have them shut me down.


Another thing I thought of is to change my SSID to "I can see what you're downloading"


I messed around with some of the settings and so far, I've filtered the offending neighbor's MAC addresses so that they get a max of 1500kbps down and 100kbps up. I'm also in the process of setting up access policies for the same MAC addresses to block all p2p traffic and block websites based off of the keywords "porn" and "facebook"

What else can I do that I can chuckle myself to sleep at night?

With recent events and certain posts, I find myself wanting to scroll through and find a mod's word on the subject but not all the posts are the color they should be 




 But I'm drunk and I love the bars we have here. It's always a good time and I love going downtown at night 









 It seems like everywhere on the internet and out in the real world people always proclaim how amazing that fast food place is. I can understand liking it but anytime someone has a different opinion they are quick to attack it. Why fight over which shitty food is slightly less shitty than some other shitty food? It's all fast food, and none of it is very good. I had it for the first time last summer and honestly it didn't seem any different from any other fast food restaurant. They just have a more "efficient" way of taking orders because they have less items on the menu so people who don't know what they want don't have to stare as long. I don't understand why everyone thinks it's so amazing. I'll cook a burger on my own grill/stove any day.


**edit** Just as I expected. Don't like In 'N Out? Downvotes for you 




 So that leaves me with the only option of making home-made ranch, because let's face it, the stuff you buy at the grocery store just doesn't cut it. What home-made ranch have you made that just blew you away with its awesomeness? 




 I always tell myself I need to do this, and I need to do that, but how do I go beyond telling myself? I can never actually bring myself to do it. Every once in a while I am able to get myself to a gym and I find myself actually having a good time cycling or using the elliptical for an hour listening to my music and I enjoy myself, but despite that it's still a struggle to even get that far. I feel unhappy with my life and the minimal things I have accomplished. I feel extremely unattractive, and it doesn't help that thanks to my family's genes, all my fat accumulates in my belly, so I almost look as if I'm pregnant.


The only good thing I've felt that has happened to me in the last couple years is getting married. I love her very much and I couldn't ever possibly see myself with any other woman. Somehow she saw through any physical or mental facade I had and saw the real me. But my problem is I don't even know who I really am anymore. It is hard for me to get out of bed every morning, and if I didn't have any other obligations, I would lie in bed all day. I set multiple alarms for myself and I cancel each and every one when they go off in the morning. Even if the alarm is on the other end of the apartment. I will get up, turn it off, and go back to bed.


I eat unhealthy food and can't make myself eat things that are good for me. I feel like I'm in a cycle of self destruction and I can't get out. It's killing me from the inside but I only keep making it worse day by day. I need help, what do I do?


**edit** Thanks a ton for all the replies guys. I promise that I've read every single comment that was a reply to the post (I don't know if I'll be able to get through all the subcomments). I am indeed a very disorganized person, and people have given me links to places that can help me keep track and help me set goals for myself. The first step I am taking will be to wake up at specific times every day (save for the one or two days a week where I work until 3am). My plan will be to wake up, eat a healthy breakfast, and go to the gym. I think I'll also pay for a personal trainer so I can get some sort of workout plan since I really don't know much about the gym and when I go I just mindlessly do stuff with no direction (this will help in the goals department) 




 spoilers for anyone who hasn't finished yet (why haven't you?)


I just don't see how the "first" crew could have existed once the "second" crew decided not to open the stargate while inside the star. The only reason the first crew ever got sent back 2000 years is because they went through the stargate, so if the second crew coming through didn't go through the stargate, wouldn't the first crew not exist? 




 Every other subreddit I go to except for this one has both a link that goes back to reddit.com and then another one that goes back to the front page of the subreddit. I'm used to clicking that link to get back to the subreddit because sometimes I enter through comment replies so I have to click on the "my reddits" at the very top and then scroll to r/simcity which is a little frustrating when I don't have to do it anywhere else 









 I don't have cable TV so I had to find a stream and indeed they are airing 3rd generation Toonami. Dear god don't let this be a cruel April Fools prank 




 I can't seem to find a relevant law except in vehicles. Either it is legal or bozeman cops are extremely lax about open containers late Thursday, Friday, or Saturday nights 




 If there's one thing I don't entirely understand in SC4 is having neighbor cities. A lot of people say that the only way to really have a successful city is to have it connected to neighbor cities. I guess I just can't wrap my head around the fact that I can move one city +50 years and the other city sits dormant until I load it up. I just don't understand how that actually benefits me. 




 Looking to get some paints for my wife's birthday because she wants to get back into doing some painting. What are your favorite acrylic paints and what colors should I get? Any brand I look at I can't find "just red" or similar base colors...my wife likes to mix her own colors rather than buy tubes of pre-made colors.

 I was just waiting in line to buy a soldering iron at Radio Shack and when the old guy in front of me got up there he asked if they carried GPS blockers. When the puzzled salesman said no he asked where he could get one but the salesperson had no idea.


Do you think this was an old guy paranoid the government is tracking him every day through his cell phone's GPS? Maybe he read the stories about the FBI putting trackers on peoples' cars and he didn't want it to happen to him?

 I have a couple Renegade Ops gifts in my steam inventory and I'd like to trade for something, I don't know what though. 




 The music. Both Mass Effect 1 and 2's soundtracks have been listened to by me more than any other soundtrack, movie or game. And I'm sure that the music in the third franchise will not disappoint me. I think that they deserve my money. I know there's a whole lot of other shit going on with ME3 and EA, but I hold the value of the music very high, and as such, I will purchase the game, and I will enjoy every minute of music that is heard.


On top of that, Clint Mansell is onboard for music this time around, so it should be interesting. For those of you who don't know, he's responsible for the Requiem For A Dream soundtrack.

The only thing I have to go off of is that the original file name was "The Story" and I bet you can imagine how useful typing in "The Story song" on Google is. I'm just hoping someone else finds this song familiar because I'd like to hear more like it! It has been on my hard drive for years and I still have never heard of a source

I feel like I've looked at every single music related download on TES nexus and I still haven't found it 




 I wish I had taken a picture of the wire management before. This case has absolutely no cable management features, it was rather frustrating for a young me to get things to look nice. Having a smaller graphics card certainly helps!
[Picture of current wire management](http://i.imgur.com/NuWao.jpg)
It's not the best cable management but it is pretty much the most I can do. The only place I can hide the un-used cables is to shove them into the 5.25" slots.

[I can't believe how much smaller the 6570 is compared to my old nVidia 7800GT](http://i.imgur.com/Euvm1.jpg). It was always annoying because the power connector faced where the hard drives were and it was an extremely tight squeeze which regularly made maintenance a pain. I will never own another case where the hard drive bays face that direction again.

 Woke up out of nowhere even though I didn't get any sleep the night before. Starting to feel a bit hungover. ffuuuuuuuu

also, still drunk lol 




 What do you like to drink? What's your favorite alcohol? Do you prefer straight up shots, mixed drinks, or beer? What is your favorite drunk story? Do you drunk call, text, Reddit, or internet?

Auto correct is such a godsend while drunk!

I love fireball whiskey. I bought a whole case of it last time it was on sale. I usually drink whiskey over any alcohol. I hate beer it tastes nasty. I only drink it when I'm drunk enough that my tongue is numb so I can't taste

What do you eat while drunk? I'm quite partial to pizza!

I haven't eaten anything today so I didn't have to drink that much to get drunk! I like it that way. Less alcohol to buy. I'm at the point where my face is numb!

I don't have many stories with me being drunk because I shunned alcohol for a while. But you know what? I don't care anymore. My side job is sitting with a bus driver either Thursday, Friday, or Saturday to transport drunk people around. We usually get 70-100 people per night. That job is so easy and I'd consider myself somewhat of a pro at handling drunk people when I am sober, but I love being one of them. Its awesome when I get on the bus when I'm drunk because I dont even have to remember where I live since I'm friends with the drivers.

Thanks for reading this Reddit night crew. I love social interaction when I'm drunk despite being somewhat of an introvert. My wife and my friend and I are about to get on the bus to go downtown in 15 min 



















 Gonna throw it in my old PC with an ASUS A8n SLI Premium, AMD 4200+ X2, 2GB DDR 400. I know it's a little overkill for an HTPC but it was cheap and I had a gift code to use that was expiring soon. All I really needed was a little improved performance over my nVidia 7800GT and HDMI out with audio.

What software and hardware do you guys use for your HTPCs? I was thinking of also getting the logitech RF wireless keyboard that has the trackpad on it for $40 




 OT XI? :noes::run::greddy: 




 Now i can't get my OT fix for the night. Guess I get to browse Reddit more :/ 









 I can't seem to ever find the motivation to do anything I want to do. I just waste away and do absolutely nothing. At the end of every day I am ashamed of myself of not setting forth to accomplish the goals I set for myself and I tell myself I will do better tomorrow, and it all begins with waking up. 

I want to get around 6-7 hours of sleep, but no matter how rested I feel when I wake up, I still lie in bed, pressing snooze or even setting the alarm to a later time. I sleep until I feel tired from sleeping too much. Any plans that I had that I planned for the morning before I started my day will not get done, there is no time. I feel as though I never get out of bed unless I have an obligation to go to such as work or school. I've tried moving my alarm so it's not next to my bed, hell I've put it downstairs so I actually have to walk down the stairs to turn it off. And what do I do? I climb back in bed and sleep for another hour.

How can I convince myself that going to the gym in the morning is an obligation BEFORE I go to class? I'm overweight, out of shape, unhealthy, and eat only two-sometimes one meal a day. I want to change this. I need to wake up after 6 hours of sleep, I need to go to the gym, I need to eat healtheir, but how do I begin? 









 Everyone must either use a Bluetooth headset or a dashboard mount to talk on the phone (dashboard isn't really hands free but I'm not complaining)

Mp3 players are still allowed I guess.

 When I was a freshman in college living in the dorms, I decided one night that I wanted to go out and get some McDonalds. I had stayed up all night finishing a project and came back and slept away the afternoon and the food halls were closed by the time I woke up.

I don't usually like eating by myself at a fast food restaurant, plus I'd rather have been watching TV/sitting at the computer while eating so I got my food to go. When I got to my car I put my food on top of the car so that I could put my soft drink into my cupholder. And there's the mistake I made. The classic "order something to go, and put it on top of the car, and completely forget as you get into the car and drive off" mistake.

Of course I was completely oblivious that I was forgetting something vital to my nourishment that night as I got into my car. Not only until I got most of the way back (just outside of my parking lot) that I realized something had gone horribly wrong. But that's when I spotted it. It was a miracle, a godsend, a grand triumph. Something was flapping in the wind over the top of the spoiler on my car! Yes, you guessed it! It was my McDonalds bag of food! It slid all the way down from the top of my car, and the bulk of the weight got wedged underneath the spoiler only to have the top of the bag freely flap around.

I quickly parked my car and ran back to retrieve my spoils that I had so carelessly forgotten about in my hungry stupor. The very main reason I had left the confines of my warmly flourescent-lit room made of brick and tile. The safety of the carefully selected position of my desk. The blue glow of the lights emitting from my computer tower. Much to my surprise, the food was still very warm, and all items I had ordered were accounted for.

I rushed up the four flights of stairs to my room. Today there was a triumph. I could have lost something vital to my very identity as a human being. I devoured my meal with much vigor. The fact that it was nearly lost to the solid black rivers of transportation that we call roads made it that much more delicious. The events of tonight had truly went better than expected.

TL;DR: I put food on top of my car and left it there on accident. It got stuck under my spoiler and rode all the way home and I didn't even lose a single fry.

I was thinking about adding on another graphics card, but someone else tells me that it wouldn't be much more than a hot paperweight that costs $350 and that I should maybe invest in a full on liquid cooling system instead of the CPU cooler I currently have in the build. Any suggestions? 




 Obviously, I'm going for a gaming PC, but I also do a bit of music production and would like to do some midi orchestration.

I'm thinking I should get an SSD for the computer, and really my only requirements is that the PC have at least 16gb of RAM.

I don't need any more hard drives other than the SSD, I already have about 10tb laying around. I don't need any monitors or speakers.

Problem is, I don't even know where I should start for the build. And with black friday around the corner, I don't know what deals I should be looking for to get the most bang for my buck 




 "9-1, undefeated in conference and guess who's playing like a high school B squad? Sad day in Bozeman." 




 I recently installed the update for the appstore app and while visually the app looks great, it has been a nuisance ever since. It's all in the notifications. 

I'm fine with a notification telling me I have an update, but not allowing me to close the notification from the notification bar is just plain wrong. There's no reason why I should be forced to open the app to see that update. 

Another notification problem: the app decided to try to download an app/update even though i have it set to wifi download only. But instead of actually downloading, i had a lovely status bar in my notifications that read 0% all day long. Again, no way to close the notification and when I opened the app, it didn't even say it was downloading. 

I tried looking in the settings but i couldn't for the life of me find an option to disable notifications. I went into my Android application settings to see if I could just force close the app but even though i kept getting these notifications every hour it didn't say the app was running. That leaves my only option which is to uninstall it which I don't want to do.  




 Does anyone know how the game is going to be broadcast? We weren't able to get tickets to the game so we'd like to invite a few people to our house and watch it on our TV, but the problem is we don't have Cable TV. Just internet. Does anyone know if someone will stream the game over the internet or if it will be broadcast over the air so I can pick it up with an antenna? 
























 Some friends of mine started up a Red Power/BuildCraft combination server. Both mods work really well together. We were trying to kind of keep the spirit of minecraft but have some improved redstone stuff and basically endgame material. We didn't add IndustrialCraft because it just seems like way too much.

Anyone else use these mods? Have any cool builds you did? Unfortunately I don't have anything to share because it takes a while to get up and running! Though the high amount of gems you can use for pickaxes help a lot! that way you can leave diamonds for pipes and gears 




 I really think that something needs to be done about experience orbs. When a player dies in SMP it creates way too many floating entities. I just died on a server from a creeper and all the experience orbs just about crashed the server. I had to lag my way slowly over to where the orbs were and sit there for a whole two minutes so that I could pick up what felt like half a million experience orbs. Stuff like this CAN'T be good for larger servers with more people online and possibly more than a few dying at the same time. I was the only one online at the time of this happening, so I can't imagine what would have happened if there were more online.


When there is a lot of experience orbs in one area, they should group together and become one to a few large orbs instead of a ton of tiny ones.


As for how hard this would be to implement? I don't really know, but *something* has to be done because it's a near game-breaking thing.



I'm not always up-to-date on my minecraft news, but has Notch ever addressed this issue? If he has could someone perhaps clue me in? 




 Rifle Hunting season opening weekend was last weekend here in Montana. I brought my phone with me, as I bring it everywhere, and as I expected, there was no service up in the mountains. I was messing around with it and much to my surprise and enjoyment, I found out that my phone doesn't have an aGPS chip/unit, it actually has a standalone one, so I was able to use GPS Essentials and plot waypoints and see how far they were from my position and all that all without needing a cell phone signal. Talk about nerdgasm! I wasn't expecting to do anything on my phone but play some offline games I had.


Now this leads to the point of this post: what apps out there are good for the outdoorsman who has no wireless signal? I found that Google Maps caches some maps (I presume the surrounding area of wherever you live, as my entire city I could zoom all the way in on in Maps, but my current position was just a blur). But I'd like to go further, is there an app where you can cache maps from google maps, or load other maps into it so I can see where I am via GPS and plot waypoints to navigate through the mountains? GPS Essentials did a lot but I'd like to take it a step further. I'd like to see maps and record where I went and see how far I traveled. For some reason the tracks function in GPS Essentials only records the distance between the starting point and the end point in a straight line, instead of distance traveled. 

Another awesome thing I could use is an app where I can load maps that show me private and public plots of land. Sometimes while driving along the road we see something but we don't always know whether the land out there is private or public. 




 The wife and I are trying to find some horror movies. We always watch the same movies year in and year out during October. It's hard for us to want to stray from those movies and spend money on something that turns out to be a gorefest. The problem for me is that the horror category groups both creepy/scary movies in with slasher flicks. We like paranormal movies, not stuff like Saw. I mean some death is fine but i just don't like movies just full of people dying gory deaths. I want something that will be haunting or make my skin crawl. 

Any suggestions?  
























 I saw that this was on the known bugs section for the minecraft wiki. But it seems that of the 3 servers I play on, only the one I play the most on is having this issue. Has anyone found a temporary fix for this? 




 I made an underground tree farm in a server I play on. I noticed that when one grew, it only had one or two leaf blocks on it. I thought that was strange so I went to walk over to it and I got stuck where leaves usually are. I logged out and in only to find that the leaves did indeed spawn with the tree...but for some reason they were invisible to me. The only way for me to see the leaves to chop down the tree is to log out and in after the tree grew 














 Usually when i drink with friends I just take a shot here or there but I barely ever get a decent buzz going. So last night was the first night in two weeks I could drink and either not have to sit at home or worry about a ride home so I said FUCK IT. I wanted to take the fast track so i drank 4 double shots of fireball whiskey before getting a ride to the bars. 

I had an awesome fucking night and I don't even know why... We barely did anything! But for some reason everything was funny and everyone was amazing. If you can't tell it was my first real time being drunk. I didn't even realizz I was drunk until someone told me I was... I kept insisting I was only tipsy. I also retained the ability to use proper Grammer while drunk texting/IMing  




 Busy night tonight being it some beer festival or whatever. Last run is gonna be a shitshow 




 This compilation of mods is super awesome. I had some trouble getting it to run without crashing but it was worth it. Millenaire is one of the best mods i've seen and i don't know how I haven't heard of it til now. 

I hope towns in 1.8 are similar to how the ones in Millenaire work or else I might be a tad bit disappointed =/ 














 It seems like every time I have somewhat of an emergency the only thing available is that emergency place that costs a ton of money just for my animal to be physically looked at. At least in Billings I have a 24 hr vet to go to. 

For being such a pet loving town, the vets sure aren't very animal friendly...  




 Not sure if there are any super serious injuries but almost the entire police force has been called down there. Cool car got fucked up and took out a fire hydrant 

It's a good thing there weren't people on that corner like there usually are or it would have expected been a real bad ordeal. Happened just now at 110 AM 




 At almost any time i look at my phone is have a notification for email. It's borderline annoying. I had to turn off sound notifications for it because I get one like every five minutes. I also get annoyed with my Led blinking whenever i'm trying to go to bed. I don't want to turn off notifications because i do like seeing when i have new mail... I just get way too many. Anyone else stuck in this predicament?  









 I looked through all the daytime routes and it doesn't appear that anything has changed unless it was too minor for me to notice. Maybe times have changed but I don't think so. The only major thing is a couple buses have a half hour service for "peak hours"

Both Upstream and Downtown start an hour earlier each night (Friday and Saturday, and Thursday, Friday, and Saturday respectively). So Downtown runs between 8PM and 3AM and Upstream runs between 9PM and 3AM. Last pickup at the bars is at 2AM. As usual Upstream runs up to campus twice within the last run. Once at 1:50 and again around 2:10 (or however long it takes to get up and drop everyone off and come back)

Downtown's route changed a bit. We do not run up to the Greyhound anymore. and we do not go past Catamount and the First Student bus depot, instead we drive right between Target and Costco. We now drop off right across the street from the side of Wal-Mart instead of by the gas station across 7th Ave. And we now drive past the Filler


Maybe one day I'll see a fellow redditor on the bus!


*edit* Here is the link to the LateNight routes
http://www.streamlinebus.com/routes-schedules/latenight-service/ 




 I live in a college town and the city doesn't have any public transportation. Instead we have a bus system that started five years ago that is mostly paid for by tuition and the whole operation is ran by students, aside from the drivers and bus maintenance ... That is contracted out to a company. 

Every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday there is a bus that runs from 8 to 3am.  Our last run is when the bars close and everyone is drunk and needs a ride home. I keep them under control and make sure no fights break out and take the necessary actions if an incident does occur. I've never had anything I've had to call the cops for though... I've had relatively good luck and haven't had too many rowdy crowds. Once we fit 100 people on a bus that seats 23 to go to a hockey game 

I have about an hour to the last run right now and usually this run is pretty quiet so AMA 









 I was just wondering if anyone else uses an app on an android device for a HTPC.  

First i found teamviewer which is awesome for remote desktop which could be useful to me in the future for troubleshooting and also i thought it was damn cool that i could connect to my laptop over 3g to track progress on a download. After this i got the idea that i could use the app as a sort of remote when i connect my laptop to the tv to watch videos instead of having to either get up and lay on the floor to navigate or pill out mt keyboard and mouse and use that on the coffee table. It worked well,  however whenever i would disconnect the application would pop up with a message saying thanks and whatnot. I didnt want to stay connected with the phone for obvious reasons so this didn't work too well. 

Then i came across remotedroid which was awesome. Works like a trackpad + keyboard over wifi.. You just start an application on the computer and connect via ip with the phone app. However it gets glitchy every once in a while and i cant seem to get rid of the keyboard without disconnecting from the laptop. The other problem is that i occasionally have to ctrl + scroll up to increase text size on websites to read on my tv from the couch... And that is not possible with this app. 

So now I'm wondering... Is there any better apps out there that r/Android can recommend to me?  




 Not sure where to go with this one...bought a whole 1.75 liter bottle of Jack Daniels and want to make some barbecue sauce...anyone have recipes?

My cat got a little too playful last night and bit me pretty hard... For some reason this particular tooth mark is really bad... The others are fine. But this. One has been hurting and swollen since the moment he but me. It's difficult to move my wrist as there is a sharp pain every time i try to use my hand. I asked someone at a pharmacy and he said most likely some neosporin will help it but that was hours ago and it still is swollen and still hurts... 


So... Should I see a doctor?  




 I've been busy this summer with travelling and work and recently I've been getting the urges to start a new Minecraft world....but my only problem is knowing that there is going to be a pretty big update...and I don't want to start a new world now only to have to start another new one when the adventure update comes out...anyone else have this problem? 









 I keep seeing the same few people posting up here.  It would be nice to have a few more people up here so we can discuss local happenings! Also when is a bozeman reddit meet gonna happen? We should start throwing some ideas out there for meetup activities as well. 

Here's a couple:

Bars (obviously... But from another post I read not all of us are of age) 

Music on main? 

Follow the Pigsty and hang out where they are lol

Hike to the M

Floating the Madison 

Fishing trip?  




 The bozeman guide to drinking post said that montana spirits and wine was the cheapest... Can anyone else confirm this?  




 I saw them the first week they started up but my schedule didn't seem to meet up with when they'd be out.  Finally got a chance tonight at the reopening of the Rocking Real Bar. It was definitely some good bbq.  Cole slaw on the sandwich and all! I highly recommend to try it out if you like bbq. I'm hoping that this isn't the last food truck that Bozeman will see. I was in California for a couple weeks this month and the food trucks there were awesome and i'm glad it's spreading elsewhere. 

If you want to check out their site its at www.pigstymobilebbq.com
Follow them on facebook and twitter to find out where they will be!  









 I'm driving from Montana to California tomorrow. This is my first road trip I've ever taken. What things should I bring that could be useful or potentially life-saving?

Android appa are welcome as well! 














 When I receive a new MMS with either music or a picture in it, when i view the picture and then press the back button to go back to my inbox, the screen turns white for a second and then goes back to the picture/song. The only way to get out of this is to press the home button..any idea what's up? 







































 If people come to your door selling magazines in order to go on a trip, and they look around 25 years old and talk about "points". Call the police immediately and tell them the direction they went in. Do not let them come into your house to fill out forms under any circumstance. I managed to get my entire wallet stolen with lots of personal information. I've just spent the last 2 or 3 hours cancelling my cards and talking to the police. They mentioned being in Billings so it seems that they are moving West. I'm hoping that by posting this I can make more people aware and hopefully I'll be able to get my wallet back because it's long gone once they leave Bozeman.


*EDIT* I found a site with pictures of the people going door to door:

 I'm trying to get a bunch of raw materials so I'm doing some strip mining but I'm finding that it's an incredible pain because I'm interrupted by baddies every 30 seconds that spawn off-screen. I guess lighting the place up doesn't help, I've been placing torches every 6 blocks, horizontally and vertically. I'm starting to think that right now my best option is to create vertical walls that are just under the width of the screen so that they can't come bother me while I'm working 














 I was recently talking to someone about spaceship design and we discussed how 99% of all games/tv shows/movies don't portray ship movement right and suddenly I had a moment of nostalgia and remembered that demo of that awesome game that never really got released from so long ago. Nexus was still good but it never lived up to what IG3 was supposed to be and the gameplay felt kindof shallow compared to how complex IG3 was. And if you ask me, even when the demo came out, the game was way ahead of its time, especially in the regard to particle effects



Here are some screenshots:

I'm just wondering if anyone else gets in the same nostalgia boat that I'm in whenever I think about this game. It's the same one where we mourn great games that never got to see the light of day. (though this one in some form sortof did). I just tried to install the demo and play it again for old time's sake but alas, the installer won't work on Windows 7 =\ 
























 Is there somewhere where I can suggest this? I like to have my apps auto update but they always seems to do it in the middle of the day while I'm at work where I'm essentially in a Faraday cage so it drains my battery. I don't use WiFi update because my home WiFi is unreliable and using 4g is actually faster and I have unlimited data still so I have no need to use wifi 














 I have no idea what's going on :\

 It's not that it's not exporting a number of tracks, it's picking and choosing which audio sources to export instead of all of them. It exports the sound from the video intro which is on track 2, and it will export the audio attached to the video which is on track one, but the song I've added at the end of the video will not render, no matter which track it's on. playback is fine within premiere but the audio is lost during encoding.

I don't understand how I can make a bunch of videos but suddenly have the audio for the same song I've been using get left out of rendering 














 The last two videos I tried rendering, the 3rd audio track isn't being rendered at all. I can't seem to even find anyone having similar problems via Google. Help? 














 Eventually I'd like to just get a remote for XBMC alone, but I also use my HTPC for browsing the web from my couch and I want to know what everyone else thinks is the best for couch browsing.

I currently have a Logitech K400 but the build quality leaves something to be desired. I've had it for over a year and the little notch on the on/off switch already wore off so it's pretty hard to turn the keyboard on and off now. The mouse buttons feel like you're barely pressing anything at all...it just feels like there is no affirmation that you actually pressed the mouse button. And on top of that, for the first year I just had the wireless dongle connected to one of the front USB ports on the PC and it worked fine from anywhere in my livingroom and even the kitchen, but now that's not good enough and I had to get a USB extension cord to bring the dongle up higher in the room so my input would stop lagging or outright not responding. 




 For me it would have to be family features and sharing. If I have two Xboxes, I can play one game downstairs, and my wife can play another in a different room, but with Steam, only one device can be logged in at a time, so that means only one of us can play any game at a time. I don't really like the idea of having to pay twice for a game unless we are going to play online with each other at the same time, but many games we buy, we don't play online, or there isn't any online.

There are two different ways I can see this happening:

1. They allow multiple devices to be connected to the same steam account on the same IP. So that means my computer upstairs can still be connected to steam while the one on our TV is also connected to Steam. Obviously, if one game is being played currently, the other computer would either be able to screenshare/observe the other player or play a different game.

2. Sharing games with different family accounts (maybe also linked to your same IP). Basically the same exact thing as above except the other computers don't have to be logged into the same account, just one that is linked with the main account. 


I think my biggest peeve with the current way Steam works is that when I open steam in my livingroom, I have to type my password again when I return to my main PC, and then when I go back downstairs again, I *again* have to type my password. It gets tiresome.

So Reddit, what are features you would like to see implemented into Steam?

I'm still real slow at editing video as I haven't really done a lot so I was up pretty much all night getting this together. On top of that I was adjusting the brightness so you could actually kinda see when the nightvision isn't being used. Hopefully we'll get to more episodes soon! 









 I got some discounted, pre-seasoned country style pork ribs the other day and I don't have the time to properly smoke/grill them so I'm going to use a slow cooker. 

But for the sake of saving money and producing more food in a variety, I was hoping someone could provide tips or insight to doing a bit more, like having more meat but not just adding more pork ribs.

Has anyone ever done such a thing and does it turn out well? something I was thinking was adding some different kinds of sausage links to the mix so that those will slow cook as well and I can either go onto reheating them another day to just eat on a bun or slicing them to use in another dish. I want to get the most out of the onion and peppers that will be in the crock pot 




 I'm visiting the area for a wedding and saw that all the machines in the Tilt had pricetags on them so I'm not sure if they're going to be closing or what. Unfortunately I don't remember the prices or all the games but some notable mentions are DDR Ultimate, Initial D, Tekken 4, 5, and Tag, and Star Wars Pod Racer. I just saw a recent post on my front page showing some stuff for sale and thought I'd share my find. 














 I've been trying to play single player and get used to everything before I jump into a server and get roflpwned by someone before I even get started.

What is the best strategy to get going? I built a small ship up with lots of mining lasers after a long while to the point where I could mine entire asteroids but even then I wouldn't get a whole lot of money from selling all that stuff. I always hear pirate hunting is good too, I equipped my ship with some shields and I had quite a large amount of lasers but I wasn't able to take down a pirate at all so I ended up getting my ship destroyed 




 Is anyone else getting this? 




 I'm building a station that requires 12 of these to be docked with it and it will act as a refueling station. My goal is to get it docked with the station without consuming any of the fuel (aside from RCS for docking)

No matter what I do, I seem to come up short of establishing an orbit because of the weight.

 I can't believe they cut one of the main SB lots that students use in half just so they can expand visitor/pay parking. I also noticed they paved the F lot near the stadium. Oh we're sorry we cut one of your lots in half but hey we paved that other lot that's twice as far so you can use that! At this point I wouldn't put it past them to change that lot to SB. 

So yeah, if you haven't seen or heard yet, now you can know what to expect if you're an off campus student when you come to get books before classes start 














 Can anyone point me to a place where I can get replacement parts for a Galaxy Nexus? 

What are frequently broken internal parts on the Galaxy Nexus that I can also buy in advance before they break and before it's too late to get replacement parts, if it already isn't too late now? The wife and i both have the phone and due to money and not wanting to lose unlimited data, neither of us will be getting any new phones anytime soon so I need to make these last as long as possible. 




 Sometimes I just don't have any money to do anything with at a certain point in the game so all I can do is wait for midnight to come around before I can get some more to do something with, and the fast time speed just doesn't feel fast enough, and I'm not talking about the performance issues, because those make it even worse. 




 So I've been somewhat out of the loop in anime for a while, especially since it seems that anything that gets dubbed doesn't catch my interest anymore, so here I am, for the first time, humbly delving into the realm of subbed anime.

The wife and I are huge FMA fans so we've seen Brotherhood already, and more recently we got into Shingeki no Kyojin/Attack On Titan and Free!

If you don't mind, please write a short synopsis of what the anime is all about and why you recommend it

I didn't see a rule against recommendation threads so sorry if this is looked down on, but waiting a week for every Attack on Titan episode is killer and it leaves me wanting to watch copious amounts of anime 





























 I'm just wondering what others' opinions are on thus. I've only ever seem the one in Butte and the one put on by Harvest in Billings and the Butte experience is far superior since you can light off your own fireworks without getting fined so the whole night is a big firework show in addition to the big show at sundown. 

I was finally able to make it to the Butte one after wanting to go for years but always working and it was awesome. It was also fun driving around town blasting Eye of the Tiger waving the American flag out the window. I have to work in the morning but it is worth it

 The wife and I are going to be attending a wedding in Missoula this weekend but we are also short on money to be able to stay at a hotel or anything so instead we are going to make a camping trip out of it. I'm not too familiar with the area around Missoula but are there decent camping areas next to a river/creek where we can pretty much just stop and set up a tent for a couple nights? We also don't want to be too far away from the city just so we're not spending more on gas 









 This probably isn't very revengey but it certainly is the most petty thing I've done in recent times.

At my job, a restaurant, our daily duties are outlined in a list. So in the morning we come in and go about our business and get things ready for working and then we get our lists and unless the managers decide to send someone home early, we're responsible for completing the list in its entirety, hopefully within 8 hours, and if the estimated time for the list is longer than 8 hours, certainly no longer than that allotted time. The list is generated by a computer and sometimes modified by the manager and it is determined by how much product we have on hand currently, and what we are projected to use that day/the next day.

On this particular day, I had probably a 10 hour list, and it was probably a Friday or a Saturday so product that we were low or out of had to be done quickly so we didn't run out. One of the things I had to do required sliced potatoes, and the amount I had to do required 50 pounds of it. No big deal, because as soon as I wash the potatoes, all I have to do is put it in a modular food processor that has a slicing attachment and 50 pounds of potatoes is sliced within a couple minutes. Except someone broke that attachment, and management didn't seem to care enough to tell me that it was broken. Had I known, I would have started on what I was working on sooner, but instead I did some other things that I knew needed to be done and the potatoes wouldn't be a big deal. 

You can imagine I wasn't very happy when I found out the part was broken because by this time we were almost out of what I needed it for, so now something that would take 5 minutes turned into an extra hour of work. I essentially had to stop everything else I was doing and focus on slicing the potatoes by hand. Slicing the potatoes themselves didn't take a whole hour, but that time I spent slicing potatoes between running things to the line and to the expo alley could have been spent doing other things if the part wasn't broken. I even asked the manager there at the time if there was anyone in another area that they could spare for about 15 minutes to help me slice the potatoes so I can get some other stuff done, and they said they would get some help for me, but that help never came.

And this is where the pettiness comes into play. On our list there is the printed estimated time to complete the list, and below that is a line reserved for the computer or manager to add additional time and then explain what the extra time is to be used for. Then there is a line below that to combine them for the total amount of time. I wrote an extra hour in myself and then in the comments wrote "slicing 50 pounds of potatoes by hand"

tl;dr: slicing potatoes by hand is for chumps like me 














 I recently got one as a gift and my last apple product was a 5th gen iPod that just sits in my car nowadays. I've mostly been into android devices so I'm not familiar with the relative apps in the iOS ecosystem. I've always heard good things about alien blue but I don't really want to pay for a reddit app.

For the most part I like it so far but I'm unsure of what exactly to do with it beyond replacing my phone as something to mess around with while on the couch watching tv. 




 My family has had lots of dogs and when I moved out and got married we got a dog ourselves about 5 years ago, but none of the dogs I've ever owned were this high energy and stubborn. We recently went to the animal shelter and we just had to have this little boy. They said he's between 5 and 8 months. People tell us it looks like he's a mix breed but I'm not sure what else he's mixed with.

I know that their energy level means lots of walks/running/playing outside as well as a bigger appetite. The shelter gave us a small bag of Science Diet for his food but once that's up we're switching him to Canadae.

Also, any tips to keep him from eating our other animal's food? Including our new puppy, we have two dogs and a cat. We have our cat's food on top of a container so our smaller dog can't get to it because she made a habit of trying to starve him to death. Our new dog wants to eat both the cat food and our other dog's food. We don't free-feed our animals, they get their daily portions in the morning, but they don't eat it all at once. 

[Here's a picture of the little guy](http://i.imgur.com/2kUzbzw.jpg) 




 I've never done it but I'm considering it since I always hear that it's healthier for the dog and even cheaper than eating kibble

 I just tried using a looping rollercoaster and the coaster just flies backward through the station after the loop and crashes. Am I doing something wrong? 









 First off, forgive me for any dumb autocorrect typos as I'm on my phone, I don't have access to a computer right now. 

My wife had her appointment on Monday with her mom there with her while I was at work. At that point she had the worst panic attack yet, complete with screaming and twisting and contorting her arms. They ended up sending her to the emergency room where they gave her something stronger than clonazepam to calm her down.

At that point I got called while at work and left work to drive 2 hours to where she was. She was calm when I got there because of the meds and I had some alone time with her to talk and she told me that she NEEDS to go somewhere where it's quiet and she needs to stay there for more than just a day and she needs to be monitored while on new meds. Her family wanted her to discharge herself against medical advice in order for me to take her 4 hours to the city we grew up in so she could go to an emergency room there and get admitted to that psychiatric facility.

Her family was convinced that if she stayed and had the crisis response team evaluate her, they would force her into a facility she didn't want to go to, and more specifically, one her cousin went to that didn't work for him. They thought the staff was lying to us but since they have no control over what can be done, I made the decision to stay so we could avoid needing to wait for more blood work and waiting another 3 hours for the crisis response team in that area.

So they came and said she could stay in a facility, and got paperwork together and faxed it to the other hospital and got us set up so we could go there. I drove her the 4 hours and we were both tired and worn out but she stayed up to talk to me and kept me awake since I had about 10 hours of sleep the last few days.

My parents met us at the hospital but it would have been too many people in the room so they had to wait outside and my wife had to sit and answer more questions and by this time that medicine had worn off so her arms were wretching again and her heart rate was high but after a bit she calmed down without needing any meds because she knew she was near the end of the journey and she would get to rest somewhere peaceful and quiet so she could heal. We still had to wait because the damn laptops the nurse was using to record her answers to questions kept freezing so she would leave and we would have to wait for her to come back with another. My wife commented "all this waiting is enough to drive a crazy person sane." After they told us that they were done and soon security would come and escort her to the psych building we could have my family come in and talk for a bit and say goodbye before she had to go. The entire process was about 15 hours including the 4 hour drive between hospitals. I really hope we dont have to go through this process again. Needing to go to the emergency broom in order to get admitted to an inpatient facility is really stupid and expensive. I understand the need to have an evaluation process but can't it be sans emergency room?

She wasn't allowed any electronics so I can only call her through the hospital to talk to her but that would be awkward for her because there are no chairs near any phones and she probably can't talk long before some activity or therapy. There are two different visiting hours that I can visit her at for an hour each, which I've done every time.

She has had a lot of support, I've been there every time, her aunt and cousins have been there a couple and so have my parents. I feel bad that none of the other people in there ever get visitors. She first started some new medication the first day but I forgot what it was. She brought up to the doctor that celexa worked for her mom and they are the same blood type so they gave that a shot and will monitor her to see if that is working. She has the clonazepam which is as needed for anxiety attacks. They also have something to prevent nightmares as well as an optional sleeping pill. I'm not super comfortable with that amount of medication because each one has their own side effects and I feel like this might turn into a game of prescribing pills to treat the side effects and then prescribing pills to treat the side effects of the pills that are treating the side effects. And now I feel like I will have to get a safe for the medication to lock it up in case she gets an urge to pop them all at once.

But ever since being in there she hasn't had any dark shadow thoughts when trying to fall asleep and there aren't any nightmares as well. Over the last few days she has definitely gotten a lot more positive and it feels like this was the best decision. I'm just afraid they will kick her out too soon and then she will regress again and we will have to go through all this over again and it's getting really hard to miss work. I've already missed 3 full weeks and I already have to miss another in May because I'm going with her mom to get surgery done out of state. It was going to be my wife but she is in no condition to get on a plane, especially with that phobia.

Today was a little rough, she had a bad headache that was due to stress in her neck which I believe to be from her slouching a lot. The pain wrapped around her forehead and her depression amplified the effects of the headache and it made her extremely dizzy and weak. Walking was difficult for her and she couldn't concentrate or talk much. I bought a journal and we've been passing it back and forth between visits and writing things in it but she was unable to focus enough to write anything for me today.

She was a lot better during the second visit. A lot more talkative and she was smiling again. Still had some effects of the headache but overall better than this morning and far better than before she got in here. Before today it was looking like she might be discharged Friday but I'm not sure now. I suppose I'll wait and see how tomorrow goes.

Thanks to everyone for all the kind words in the last post. I'm sorry I wasn't able to reply to everyone. Writing everything and putting it out there is therapeutic for me. 




 *edit* I apologize for the huge wall of text. The first paragraph alone is a whole post in of itself when expanded. I already posted about it under a throwaway, and if you really want to read it, here is the link:
http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1atq9f/my_wife_cheated_on_me_last_week_and_then/

To make a long back story short, she started going to a doctor to get something for anxiety of flying because she was going on a trip to London. The doctor also diagnosed her with depression and prescribed her fluoxetine, so she started taking that about 2-3 weeks before her trip. She thought that our marriage was failing and that there was nothing that could be done to save it so she ended up cheating on me with someone else who went on the trip with her (it was basically one of those classes in college where you go somewhere for a couple weeks and write a couple papers on your experience and get credits). She had slowly been falling in love with him over the last year or so. When he was with her on the trip, he used her only to end his dry spell and broke her heart. When she came back, she was more broken than I've ever seen her. 2 days after she got back, she told me what had happened. My heart was broken, but she is the most important person to me in this entire world, so I vowed to her that I will right my wrongs, and I won't let this ruin our relationship. On top of all of this, she had been suffering through school for the last couple years, she didn't want to keep going and wanted to take a break but she felt that her family was pressuring her to finish as fast as she could so she has been overworking herself for the last 4 years. The trip was the final straw.

Fast forward a couple more days, I found her trying to dig into her wrists with a pair of scissors, and not just cutting across the wrists, she was trying to follow her veins "to see if she could even feel it". To this day she still doesn't remember doing that. She said when she looked at the mirror, and then saw the scissors sitting there, something else took over that wasn't her, and next thing she remembered is seeing me coming up the stairs and having scissors in her hand. Luckily the scissors were dull so she didn't even break the skin. She had a counseling appointment that day, and the counselor felt that she needed to stay at a facility for a bit. She thought it might be beneficial too so she went. I brought her things like pencils, her sketchbook, and some painting supplies because that stuff has always been therapeutic for her.

The facility discharged her a day later. The head psychiatrist had a one-on-one with her and told her that she felt she wasn't afraid for her life and that she believes what happened was only an impulse and that she wasn't truly suicidal. After I picked her up, I took about 2 weeks off of work. She told me about the place. They didn't really help her. Every time she sat down and was about to paint, they would pry her away from it to do group therapy sessions, in which she would listen to other people's problems, and then when it got to her and she explained what was going on, nobody had any type of advice for her at all and they moved onto the next person. Over the night she was kept up by someone screaming. When she finally did sleep, she was awoken early by an angry person yelling in the kitchen. It wasn't a very good experience for her.

I spent the two weeks with her and her counselor determined that she was only living her life for me, but not for herself, so all she needed to work on was loving herself again. I spent every second of every day with her, through ups and downs and I took care of her. But after that 2 weeks I had to go back to work. I was more confident in leaving her alone at that time because of the healing we had done, both individually, and as a couple. That week I had 2 days off immediately after the first day of work. My wife was at home, safe, when I got off work. She said she distracted herself all day, which is good, but also not good because I don't really feel good leaving her alone when she has to distract herself to keep herself from thinking suicidal thoughts. At this point, none of our family knows anything about what happened yet. The next day she spiraled down hard. She was talking about the suicidal thoughts and saying how she's trapped and can't get out and there's only one way, and then she had an anxiety attack, so I gave her some more of her anxiety medicine (clonazepam) and it took a really long time for her to calm down. Baths were always relaxing for her, so I got the bath ready and she sat in the hot water with me by her side. Then she put her face into the water and held it there as long as she could and expelled the air from her lungs and I had to yank her out of the water. She apologized profusely and said she didn't know what she was doing. I helped her dry herself and get dressed and we went back downstairs where she slept on the couch for at least 2 hours.

This is where I cracked. I've never had a panic/anxiety attack, and it caused me to make some bad mistakes because of a lapse of judgement. As soon as she woke up my breathing went into a frenzy. I tried calming it by taking deep breaths but it didn't work, it kept getting worse and worse and I was taking deep breaths and I was crying and I couldn't stop. I scared my wife, even though she had panic attacks herself, she hadn't dealt with anyone else having one. I've never seen her look so scared before. She didn't know what to do. She gave me one of her anxiety pills but even then it took me a long time to come down. She paced back and forth not knowing what else she could do. She sat down on the couch and cowered in the corner. When my attack was over and the medication had dulled me a bit, she took me for a drive through town like I did for her, just listening to music and not really driving in any specific direction.

After this is where I made the mistake that I regret the most. When we got home we decided to catch the bus downtown and we could go dancing and drinking. Mixing the alcohol and the medication was something that didn't even cross my mind at all....but I later found out it was on hers the whole time. We drank, and we kept drinking. We had lots of fun. I don't remember portions of that night because I did drink so much. We were able to stumble our way to a friends house where we stayed for the night. The next morning we woke up and began walking the rest of the way home and she was upset...and then she finally said it, the thought that didn't even cross my mind. She said she wanted to go peacefully last night. She hoped that drinking so much alcohol in combination with both of her medications that she would pass on during the night while she slept. Luckily, her depression medication was taken in the morning and the clonazepam was in the early afternoon, and we didn't drink until late at night, so it wasn't as if she downed her meds and immediately started drinking.

After this is where things got real scary for me. Halfway home, she completely forgot what had happened in her life. She suddenly reverted back to being 12 years old. She didn't know who I was, or where we were, and why I was holding her hand. She didn't remember where we lived but she instinctively knew which apartment was ours but didn't recognize it. We were greeted by our dog when I opened the door and she was excited to see a puppy but she didn't really know who the dog was. But she said she had a dream that her grandpa got her a dog around Christmas time and so she named her Noel (and that is actually what happened). After I talked to her for a bit she suddenly became very tired and fell asleep on the couch for at least an hour. When she woke up, she was back to herself but she didn't know how we got home and only remembers walking half of the way. She didn't remember reverting back to being 12 years old.

At this point her mom randomly showed up to run errands in town (she lives in a small town a couple hours away) and wants to have lunch with us, so we eat somewhere and then she dropped us off at the appointment we had for that day with her doctor. Her mom could tell something was up and noted that she seemed down, but she insisted nothing was wrong, and when we got out of the car, I told her that I can't hold my tongue on this situation much longer and that she can't keep avoiding her family. She told me that if I felt I needed to tell her mom then I could do that. We talked to the doctor about the previous couple days and how she spiraled back down as soon as I had to go back to work. He felt that she wasn't safe to herself and needed to go back to the facility. This is when her mom found out because she was our transportation, so when her mom showed up I went and brought her inside and the doctor explained the situation. We took her to the facility, but upon getting there, they said there were no beds left but there were other places that were in the same network in some other cities. Her mother didn't think that bringing her to another facility was a good idea so instead we agreed to let her go home with her mom, where she, her brothers, and her grandmother could keep an eye on her at all hours of the day, whereas I am unable to do so. She can't be left alone for even a minute or else the thoughts could come flooding back.


***My post is getting too long so I'm continuing in a comment***

 I recently got a job and it seems that my most common shift will be 4pm to midnight or 1am. I haven't done night shifts since high school and back then I didn't really have any daily responsibilities. It was just get off school, do homework, go to work, come home, watch a bit of TV, go to bed, and repeat. But now I'm an adult and I've already been conditioned to waking up an hour before I have to go to work in the morning and do all my daily things after work. 

Doing nights now means I can't really do my things after I get off work. Do you come home, shower, and go straight to bed and wake up as early as possible? I seem to have trouble with falling asleep after putting in 8-9 hours at work so I end up staying up really late browsing the net and watching TV and then I sleep until 11am-noon, and after that I only have 4 hours before I have to go to work so I don't do anything because I feel like there isn't enough time to do anything before work as I'm constantly anticipating and watching the clock to make sure I'm not late.

Anyone who has done night shifts for a while or does it for a living have any protips for me? I love this job, but without having something that's mandatory to wake up for in the morning, I'm having a hell of a time trying to manage my time wisely and I feel like it's messing with the amount of energy I have too.

I already took the case apart and reseated the RAM as well as taking the CPU heatsink off, cleaning up the thermal compound and re-applying it. It started up just fine so I shut it off and then put it back together and put it back in its spot and started it again, and then the same boot loop happened

***EDIT:***

So I now am able to get the computer to boot properly. I kinda found the cause, I will have to do a little more testing tomorrow when I have time. Having my external harddrive plugged into the front USB ports was causing the boot loop, even though I have my first SATA port set to be the primary boot device. So now I'm not sure if it's just the USB 3.0 jumper pin area that is bad or shorted or what. But when i plug the drive in after the computer is booted, the drive is detected and works fine.

I haven't checked to see if it will do the same thing to the rear USB3.0 ports or even the 2.0 ports. Or to see if different USB harddrives have the same effect. 




 What do you do with yours? All I have is the paddle, the dough hook, and the whisk, and my paddle is a pain because I'm constantly needing to use my spatula to scrape the sides and that isn't so easy with really thick dough stuffs

Where before it was working just fine in an earlier iteration of the project:

*edit* I fixed the problem, but I'm still wondering why it did that. What I had was an entire PSD project imported into After Effects with all editable layer styles. I don't know why the gaussian blur would do that just because the layer styles were intact. What I had to do was import that layer separately as footage and merge the layer styles and then after that it blurred properly. 


































 What is the best thing that you experience or happened to you this year? 
























 If it is how much more water am I supposed to add compared to what I would add for bleached flour?

I always thought there really wasn't a difference between whole wheat flour and bleached flour 





























 First off I'll mention it is a Verizon Galaxy Nexus. I know there are some LTE radio problems with the Verizon version but after using it for about a week I haven't experienced any of the problems I've read people coming across.


This phone just feels fantastic. I got it used from someone who ended up needing to get an iPhone for work because it was all Apple integrated stuff. Phone is practically brand new, with an Incipio case and the extended battery. 

But now I'm wondering, what reasons could I possibly have to switch to a custom ROM like let's say CM10? What are the benefits of using CM10 over the version of JellyBean I have on the phone? Or any other ROM for that matter?

I am going to root it just because it's a useful thing to have be done, but I just don't know what improvements a custom ROM will have. 




 About 2 years ago my monitor started acting up and then it finally just stopped working entirely. I read that it was common for the problem to be blown capacitors and it was an easy fix, so I opened it up and took everything apart, found some bulging capacitors and took a note of the specifications of each one. Then I went to mouser.com and ordered replacement capacitors. The replacement parts arrived but then I delayed fixing it because I didn't have a soldering iron at the time. I kept delaying it every time I had free time to get a soldering iron I'd be like meh I'll do it later. A year or so went by and I still hadn't fixed it. The stand was still sitting on my desk, the board was still on my desk, and the rest of the monitor sat on my floor. 

I then finally went and got a soldering iron from Radio Shack as well as some solder, and then again I put it off day after day, week after week, month after month. Finally yesterday while cleaning up the room I decided TODAY is the day. I got out my replacement parts, opened up my soldering iron and I went to down. All in about a half hour I had completely replaced all the bad capacitors and was ready to plug everything in and see if it worked, and it did! It worked perfectly as if it were brand new. So I put everything back together and the part that surprised me is that I remembered where each and every screw went. I was afraid I would have forgotten after 2 years of having it completely dismantled.

So here I am, with my old 2nd monitor again, satisfied with life. Here's a small album of pictures

So, Reddit, what are you proud of that you fixed instead of replaced? 




 I see more than one thing wrong here:

Firstly, he's interfering with someone's class, which he shouldn't be doing.

Secondly, he's making assumptions. Somehow he was under the impression that the students were not prepared to put the play on, and yet he had no proof of this. He has no idea how much work had been put into the play. It had been in planning since about the second week of school. If he thought they weren't prepared, he shouldn't have waited until the night everything was supposed to go down to cancel it.

His personal feelings is that the play would reflect poorly on the English department, but in reality, him being a class A jerk is what will reflect poorly on not only his department, but him too. This is not how a department should be run, everyone in the play was genuinely excited for tonight, and to step on that is just wrong down to the very core. I'm involved in the play in two ways. I know people actually in the play and they are extremely upset about it being cancelled because Gaines has no idea how much work was actually put into the play. The second thing is my boss's company is one of the sponsors for the play. It was just a little thing but to have his gesture of goodwill be for nothing is a direct slap in the face by Dr. Gaines.

I'm currently drafting a letter which I will send to him, the dean of the College of Letters and Science, and President Cruzado. Even if you hadn't heard of the play, or you did and weren't planning on attending, please contact these three people and tell them how you feel about this situation. Dr. Gaines needs to know what he did was wrong and he should be made to retract his decision and allow the play to happen.

* [Dr. Philip Gaines' contact info](http://www1.english.montana.edu/faculty/gaines-philip.html)
* [Dean of College of Letters and Science, Paula Lutz. Her info is in the bottom left of the page](http://www.montana.edu/lettersandscience/)
* [President Cruzado](http://www.montana.edu/president/)

Please spread the word about this. The university we attend should ***not*** act this way. 




 I really wish I could go over but I absolutely cannot right now so are there some ways I can cut some corners while keeping the 250gb SSD? Was hoping to upgrade my PC I bought last year with the bigger SSD and putting the old 128 in the new PC.

A couple quick notes because for some reason some items aren't listed at some merchants:

* The Corsair PSU is 47.99 at Amazon

* The SilverStone case is $95 at Amazon

For some reason the Reddit Markup doesn't show the base price before mail in rebates which is $869.92. Adding in the instant discounts, it's $848.33. Adjusting the price for the items I'm getting off of Amazon (the PSU and case) the price is 814.77. I need to get just below $780. All items have to have free shipping, amazon prime, or shoprunner qualifications so that I don't have to spend money on shipping. Everything on Amazon is free 2 day on my list and everything on Newegg in the cart so far is shoprunner. 

Basically all I need to do is shave $40 off the build. What can I do to accomplish that? I can't change the case, it needs to be that one to work. Should I just buy most of it and wait to get some other items? I can temporarily put a stick of ram in my current PC into the new one but cutting out the RAM only brings the price down by $25.

Just a quick note: the first build includes the PVR, the second doesn't have it added in.


Basically for this computer, I want to use it as my HTPC but I also want it to be able to play games. Nothing super fancy at ultra graphics and super resolutions, just basically be capable of playing most modern games at a decent framerate 




 I'm not very familiar with mid-range products and what is better than what, especially when it comes to new mid-range stuff versus old top of the line parts.

The $800 has to include an SSD and a PVR, I was most likely going to go with the Happauge PVR2 Gaming Edition since it has HDMI inputs and I'd rather deal with HDMI than with Component. Does anyone have experience with dealing with PVRs? Can I just split the output from my AV Receiver and send one line to the TV and one to the PVR so I don't have to individually connect my PS3 and 360 to the PVR whenever I want to use it?

Ideally I'd like the computer to be small so it's semi-portable and sit horizontally. I'm thinking maybe a Micro ATX motherboard with a case that can fit at least 2 standard harddrives and an SSD. 









 I was downloading and at first it got stuck on "starting repair" but didn't do anything. It threw the download back up into the active downloads but it wasn't going anywhere. So I paused it and other stuff started to download like normal, but this particular download is still on top of the downloaded saying "starting repair." I'm on a slower PC and needless to say par2.exe and sab were taking up quite a bit of resources because of this. So I ended up having to kill the processes. After I restarted sab it began to verify the files and got to 34/34 and then said repair failed not enough blocks. Other items are continuing to download but this still remains on the top taking up resources. I can't remove the nzb at all, it just stays there.

This is what I see:

 It was a great place to post those catch-all type posts that don't specifically belong in a subreddit. I mean Reddit started out with no subreddits, but then after a while they got rid of the main reddit, why do such a thing? 




 My secondary job is that one to two nights a week I sit on a bus at night to basically make sure drunk people don't cause problems. It's mostly funded through the university here and is meant to reduce drunk driving. It earned the name "The Drunk Bus" but for some reason the student organization at the university thinks that's below them and wants that negative connotation gone, even though that is 100% the purpose of this bus. So we've taken it upon ourselves to turn it into the party bus!

When the bars close at 2am, we get a pile of drunk people on the bus, so I'm putting music onto my old Zune that would be appropriate for a bus full of drunk people to play over the speakers. What are must haves?

So far my list:

* most stuff by Journey

* most stuff by Queen

* The Final Countdown

* Wagon Wheel by Old Crow Medicine Show

* popular Lonely Island songs

* Party Rock Anthem

 It seems like I can never make a craft that has enough lift to actually take off before the end of the runway, and then 90% of the time I catch something after I go off that ledge and blow an engine off or something.

And then by the time I actually do get into the air with something, I don't feel like there are proper wing physics. I end up going into an unstoppable lengthwise spin and crash into the ocean

I just don't know what to do to keep the plane steady in the air, any help? 









 A business on 19th was broken into and I think was set on fire. There were firetrucks there all night tonight. On top of that Journey Church was also set on fire and it looks like the whole building is burnt to a crisp. 

I was listening to the police scanner while riding the bus (it's my job) and they increased patrols tonight, especially near businesses. Thry were looking for someone or a group all night using spotlights and flashlights to either find them or deter them from breaking into more businesses. 





























 For me it would have to be custom rules for word prediction/autocorrect in swiftkey. I love this keyboard to death but there are a few quirks that annoy the tar out of me. When I type just "i" I would like it to autocorrect to I every single time... Sometimes it doesn't. It would also help with contractions. I sometimes type "I'm" or "I'd" or "I'll"  yet when I type "im", "Im", "id", "Id", "ill", or "Ill", the contractions are nowhere to be seen. When I just type "I" I am only given one of the contractions to choose from and sometimes none. It would be a thousand times easier for me to type if I can make custom rules because despite the pattern learning it doesn't seem to get what I want to type.

 I am so sick of bicyclists being all over the road riding at like 15mph, making illegal turns and lane changes, running stop signs and ignoring traffic lights. The wife and I almost got T-Boned in our brand new truck because a bicyclist felt that stop signs didn't apply to him. 

If there is one thing I love about winter here it's that it keeps 95% of these dumbasses off the road. 




 I got two, one I intended to replace using a full PC for my media center and instead reduce it to NAS status. How does using XBMC on a Raspberry Pi compare to anything else? 




 I have a couple of games I want to play but I don't want to pay $5 for the app if I am certain game won't work on my phone or tablet. 




 I was thinking it would be cool to get a group of us together and hike up one of the couple hundred day-hike trails in the area and have a picnic/fish. Post if you're interested and we can try to get something together within the next couple of weeks! 









 Stay safe out there guys and make sure to completely put your fires out when you are camping, we don't need anymore people being evacuated from their homes. 




 A place my wife + friends really want to rent is through them and I'm wanting to know if people have had good or neutral experiences with them. I looked for reviews online and all of them were bad but it seems like most of the problems could have been avoided by documenting the place better when they moved in. But it is also my understanding that it is far more common for people to make the effort to post negative reviews than positive ones. Pretty much all the rental companies in bozeman have exclusively negative reviews online. 


































 I find myself always annoyed by rain. It seems to happen too often and for too long. Almost every time I come up from my mines it's raining. Every time I start a new project or building, it's raining. Whenever I die far away from spawn or my bed, it's dark and raining. So if you were given a way to end it all, would you take it? No I'm not offering something in the way of a mod, I always play online so a mod wouldn't do much good except for optifine where I can turn visually seeing the rain off. I'm just wondering if there are many people out there like me.

*edit* Yes I know there are single player commands and yes I know toomanyitems and notenoughitems have an option to turn off rain, and yes I know you can disable the particles with optifine. I'm not talking about a 3rd party solution, I'm talking first party solution, as in, vanilla minecraft has an option to disable rain like they do for clouds. 









 The *only* semi-viable alternative to Verizon here is ATT and that's only because they just own Alltell's old towers now. Verizon still has the best signal in the area, and besides, there's no hope for me to get unlimited by switching to ATT.

So does anyone have any advice for what I can do? The big problem for me is that my upgrade is a year out, so I can't use any upgrade pricing to get a 4g phone. And on top of that, we don't even have 4G/LTE in our area yet. Last I heard we would have it late this year or early next year but I'm afraid that if I buy a 4g phone in order to keep my unlimited, not only will I be eating the cost of buying a phone at retail pricing, but I'll also be paying an extra $10/mo for service I don't even have.

What do, Android?  




 Or should I say I have none. Not 100% sure what to do in this situation.

It was an illegal left turn, I turned left onto a street with 2 lanes on each side and went to the far lane instead of the closest lane. It was my first traffic ticket and I got it deferred over 2 years ago. 




 I always seem to catch them too late when there's already several hundred or thousand comments so my question just gets buried in the abyss. 









 The other day I opened my mailbox to find what could either be a child support billing statement, invoice, or receipt. It was meant for my neighbor. Luckily we have clips on our doors at our apartment complex so I didn't have to have to awkwardly give it to them in person, I just clipped it to their door and went along my way. 









 I can't find if there are any restrictions on this or if there are exceptions for the restrictions. I might be getting a place where there will be 4 of us, but in a year my brother is going to be graduating high school and moving up here for college and will be wanting to live with me and not on campus. Is it possible to have 5 tenants in a home? 




 Am I the only one who finds this hilarious? 









 Just beat City yesterday. Seriously these the most well done superhero games I've ever played. Obviously this couldn't have been a Batman game without Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill playing as Batman and The Joker. Both games are really great at showing off how dark the Batman universe can be while still being the typical campy Batman we all know. They went to lengths to really make sure Batman doesn't kill anyone. When you do a ledge takedown you think he's just gonna toss them over the edge but he manages to tie them to the ledge and they just hang there. And when you knock people out, in Detective Mode they are shown as unconscious. And then obviously you have everything bat related, the batarang, when he sprays explosive gel he does it in the shape of a bat, his computer is called the Batcomputer.

What I was really impressed with is your encounter with multiple of the big bad guys in the Batman universe. You're trapped in Arkham Asylum or Arkham City with just about every bad guy and his henchmen who want Batman dead. It's like the equivalent of throwing a normal person into a pit of rabid wolves. And in usual Batman fashion, not a single fuck is given and he defeats everyone. Along the way your suit gets torn up to reflect how much shit he has been through in a single night.

If you like Batman even the slightest, and maybe if you don't like Batman so much, you should give this game a go if you haven't already, it's well worth the time. I did everything possible in Arkham Asylum except the challenge mode, and I'm working on doing all the side stuff in City now. 









 I'm looking for a second job but I'd like to be doing something where I'm doing some sort of physical activity and not a job where I'm standing/sitting most of the day. Full time is also a bonus 




 I've been noticing my internet on my phone being exceptionally slow lately so I did a few speed tests today and yesterday. So far the best download I got was around 400kbps, and my upload constantly hovers around 600kbps. Is anyone else experiencing these horrible speeds? 
























 My wife took our won to go visit her parents who live out of state and went to Disney land. She overheard some parents while she was there complaining about waiting 5 hours in line for their spawn to see Elsa 




 I'm not confused, I just presented a counterpoint for your reasons  




 I can see the benefit of the one time use card but that doesn't make the app more sleek. I don't see the pin as a bad part because I'm fine with not having some weird physical button that also acts as a fingerprint scanner on my phone. As far as tapping the phone, that's the point, and the nfc chip is rather small so you need to know where the chip is in your phone. I've never tapped more than one for any nfc transaction I've made with my current or last phone which was the first phone to implement nfc and Google wallet  




 Yeah, fuck CVS, and Walmart  




 What's not as slick about Google Wallet?  




 Any nfc based payment system will work as it is a universal standard. Applepay,  Google wallet, and even ISIS (or whatever Verizon is gonna change it to)  




 It has worked for me 




 Rosauers has NFC terminals. You're out of luck though at Walmart or CVS, as they've disabled NFC in favor of CurrentC which is anticompetitive and has shit for security  




 /r/technology has been on its way downhill when it became /r/piracy 




 Time to sort comments by controversial

 What do you mean by cheating?  




 I believe CurrentC acts as a debit.

Or more accurately, an electronic funds transfer  




 What's up with the washing machine in the kitchen?  




 I wouldn't say that's prohibitive. It is a bit expensive but I think bands spend enough money on themselves that could be worth it with the tax writeoffs

 Staggering Ox, Billings Montana. OP: I love that place, any of my Billings redditors wanna do a meet up there?  




 Somewhere on reddit I saw a link to their simple no frills router that costs like $20 and plenty of people saying they use that as the router and then have an external wireless access point. My modem/router is already in a central location so that's not necessarily an option I need but I did notice they have wireless routers too. I'm just wondering how they compare to ASUS given any model you look at is half the cost of its Asus counterpart. Should I get tp-link or just go with ASUS? 




 I get the feeling she supports him but also had to be in control. In one I watched someone is on the elevator and she keeps repeating herself that he likes to film the elevators because he's "like an engineer student". She's not letting him talk for himself (is he capable of talking to other people?) and does a piss poor job of explaining what exactly he's doing. In another video he is very vocal (but there were no other people in contact with him) and described a lot of things so maybe he doesn't actually feel comfortable doing this with his mother around despite her facade of supporting his hobby? The tone of the videos with his mother versus without are very different  




 Most definitely a he. The female voice you hear is his mother  




 Watch some of his recent videos.

 I've tried searching Google for this but the only thing I found if a certain setting was enabled with lastpass and it would cause the camera to crash. However that setting on lastpass is not enabled (basically the problem would he that lastpass would look for a place to enter login credentials in the app). This is really frustrating because I can't use my camera at all now. I've tried everything short of factory reset which I'm not really wanting to do 




 Using Windows 7 here. I can just be browsing the web or watching a show and windows pops up with "nzbget.exe has stopped working" dialog box. I then restart the program and it can go anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours before it crashes again 




 Are these decent horns? I have a Xeno from when I used to play more. I'm hoping my son will take to liking the trumpet and I'd like to have one on hand that isn't as expensive but will also produce decent sound with practice. I'd let him use my old Jupiter but I've gotten that thing deep cleaned countless times and the valves are just awful and continue to stick. 

I saw the Cleveland at a pawn shop for    $200. No damage except for scratches and scuffs, and the valves and slides are smooth as butter.

I don't know much about tools. I'm only getting started on trying to find tools now that I have space to do some woodworking 









 I recently saw either here or on /r/diy someone made a desk or table by gluing 2x6s together to create a flat surface top. I'd like to make a desk like that for myself and I'm wondering what tools I'd need to do the job and how to do the legs for the desk in a manner that I have a completely flat top surface, but still be able to take the legs off whenever I move 









 I've had this problem to varying degrees and I don't know what exactly is causing it or how to deal with it. 

In my car I have a pioneer head unit with an auxiliary jack. He cable I've had in it for years has worked great for all my devices. 

In my truck I used to have a different cable that would produce noise with any device. Eventually the cable broke so I used one of my shortest ones temporarily. The short one produced no buzzing noise but it was too short. I got some long ones from monoprice and the plugs are too big for my case and even without my case they don't fit snug and the slightest movement makes them pop out a tiny bit and then audio stops. 

I moved the short cable that produced no noise to my work Truck that has an auxiliary jack. In my work Truck, I have to have the volume pretty loud to hear the audio from my phone. There is a buzzing but it's not too annoying. When I plug my phone into a charger, it gets louder but the buzzing gets worse and is constantly changing instead of just being a steady tone. 

Would a mobile headphone amp help this issue? Or would it only make the sound louder without cleaning it up? 









 I mean that's a really cool feature that I don't have to pick up a remote to change an input or turn anything on. I used to cast to my PS3 but this is easier. Now here's my dilemma, can I get it to change back when the devices disconnect? I have the chromecast on my TV since it has CEC/Bravia Sync, but my receiver doesn't have it. The only remote I use is my receiver remote, so having to get my TV remote isn't preferable. 




 It wouldn't be so bad if every single video didn't open as some sort of playlist. When I go to a user's page and open a specific video, I'm not wanting to open a playlist of their entire history of uploads and I am CERTAINLY am not wanting to have the next video play automatically. This is driving me insane and is forcing me to use my PS3 or Chromecast for youtube because at least I don't have to worry about this problem with that platform, but the problem there is having the list of videos start back up at the top after I scrolled down for a specific video. Also, I have almost all my subscriptions sorted into categories so I can find specific users easier, which is not supported on android.


Does anyone know a way to stop this nonsense? 









 How can I deal with this for post processing where I won't have to do anything manual to combine them together so they can be renamed and moved appropriately?

I'm running nzbget and nzbdrone on windows 









 And then in passing I heard that it is a bad idea to can with a glass-top stove? Is this true? The only problem I can see is if the pot I use is bigger than the heat rings. I've never had a proper canning pot, just my regular big pot which I think fits in the big ring. 

If I get a bigger pot should I also invest in an electric burner to use instead of the stove? 









 [you can already see the ones weighted down bowing] (http://www.imgur.com/J4qvoXO.jpeg) 

What would be best to replace these with? Ideally cheap too 














 I have a 2012 Ram 1500 and when I got the truck years ago I stupidly didn't think that normal toppers wouldn't work with the Ram Boxes, I was too busy being impressed by the novelty of the ram boxes. Don't get me wrong, I like them, I keep my fishing stuff in one permanently, and roadside tools in the other. But I'm a little upset with myself over not having a topper. I want one because I'd like to go tent camping but I live in bear country so all my supplies and food need to be left in the truck. Bear-proof containers and coolers are expensive and don't offer much space since the walls need to be so thick, and a flat cover will just not do in this situation. 




 I recently bought some new cables to use in my cars for auxiliary audio. I have a really short one I've never had problems with except that it's too short. These are just simple cables from monoprice.com and I thought stuff there was decent quality but I really don't know if it's the cables or my phone because my wife's nexus 5 works perfectly fine with them. But with my phone it never stays in all the way. If you bump the phone ever so slightly, the cable comes out just enough to stop the audio 

Anyone else have headphone jack problems? 




 Can be something big or something small but it has to irritate you to no end where you still might be irked by it hours down the road 




 Just moved into a duplex and the shower water pressure is just awful. I might as well stand out in a rain shower. How would I go about finding out if this is an internal issue or if it's low water pressure being supplied to the house? We have our own water heater in the unit, thought that should be noted. 

What would I do in either situation to remedy this? I'm going to be living here for the foreseeable future and not having water pressure in my hot shower after doing dirty work is unacceptable. I already feel as if I can never really get clean and a shitty shower will only amplify this.

*edit* water pressure for cold and hot water is the same 




 I recently moved and my HTC wall adapter must have gotten packed away and the only wall adapters I have are my older ones which charge my phone too slow. I'd like to get some with similar output so I can have a few to put around the house. 














 I wear a hat for work, which happens to be pretty physical. I get dirty and touch the hat and I sweat while wearing it. I don't like not wearing a hat for work but my hat is really dirty and actually starting to smell awful. How do I clean one of these things without ruining it? 




 Our newborn hates his cradle, but most of all he hates sleeping on his back. Since he was born we have not been able to get him to sleep more than an hour or two at once on his back unless he's extremely exhausted. This is leading him to be overly tired, preventing him from getting restful sleep when he does sleep. 

We found that he zonks right out when he is put on his tummy when he's tired though. He's sleeping right now and has been for 2.5 hours. I'm concerned though because up to this point everyone and everything has been saying to not lay a newborn on their tummy when they aren't being watched because sleeping face down can increase the risk of SIDS. I want him to be able to sleep but he doesn't sleep well on his back.

It should also be noted that he is 100% capable of lifting his head and turning it while he's laying face down and he can also scoot in circles when he's frustrated/hungry enough
 




 I'm a beverage delivery driver and my hands get so fucking dirty every day and I can never really get them clean. I even got some Gojo industrial handsoap with the pumice in it but I still can't get a good portion of the crap off my hands. 

[this is what my hands look like right now] ( http://www.imgur.com/Q3adbKi.jpeg) 

what are other good hygiene tips for working a manual labor job? 




 On July 3rd our first son was born and we've been having some trouble splitting the responsibility, primarily because I work a minimum of 12 hours per day and drive a truck, which is only compounded by the fact that I get sleepy while driving no matter how rested I am. I have terrible difficulty waking up at night when he needs a diaper change or to be fed and my poor wife isn't getting any sleep and is falling asleep in the middle of the day breastfeeding him. 

He seems to hate his cradle. After you've changed his diaper, fed him, and lulled him to sleep, as soon as he hits the cradle the fussing cycle starts all over. He could be dead asleep in your arms for 2 minutes or 2 hours but once the cradle gets involved all bets are off. 

When I get home from work I basically take care of the baby for the rest of the evening so she can go take a long deserved nap but it isn't enough sleep for her. Luckily, we've been living with my parents because of various life events and they're helping us get on our feet again so grandma and grandpa have been really helpful as far as holding him so the wife doesn't have to be along for more than half the day while I'm gone. 

I'm just at a loss at what more I can do :/ 









 I'm looking for some new shoes but I don't know what kind will be best for delivering to stores/merchandising. What are good shoes that are good for all weather outdoor conditions as well as indoors? 




 He's only 5 days old right now, we've had to file his nails and we pretty much need to have little mittens on him at all times because every time he pees, poops, gets hungry, mad, or frustrated, he fails his arms like crazy and then proceed to scratch the crap out of himself. He's already gotten his face near his eye a couple of times. 




 My wife and I are currently staying with my parents until we get back up on our feet which could be a bit given my current job. We just had a newborn but I still end up with enough free time that I go crazy with boredom. My parents watch a lot of TV that I don't care much for so basically I'd like something that doesn't require a lot of tools, something I can do in front of the TV 









 I don't use auto brightness because I like to just have one consistent brightness, but every once in a while when I'm using the phone, only while it's plugged in, the brightness seems to flicker. It seems like it only happens when I'm adjusting my position or the phones position. 




 Months ago I posted in here asking for advice because my wife was experiencing extreme pains during the second trimester and was repeatedly dismissed by her OBGYN. It all came at am awkward time because we had already scheduled a new appointment for a different OBGYN because we were moving and the pains started right after cancelling an appointment with the old one. 

We finally got into the new OBGYN and they found she had some sort of infection and got her on antibiotics and fixed her right up. Leading up to the pregnancy she had a LOT of pre-labor type contractions and also retained a lot of water and he was growing at a faster rate than what was normal I suppose. 

Anyway the labor pains got real regular and intense last night and she thought her water broke so we came into the hospital. She was still only 2cm but after 6 hours of checking every 2 hours, sitting in the jacuzzi tub, walking around they finally felt a difference and decided the baby was going to come. 

Long story short, she got a spinal numb (I forget the actual term but it wasn't an epidural, the doctor couldn't get a spot for that one), they let her sleep for a half hour and then the doctor came back and it was crunch time. Literally 3 contractions and he was out and breathing fresh air and crying. Everything went well.  [Say hello to Finn Orion!] ( http://i.imgur.com/MuTt9xO.jpg) 









 It's 4 in the afternoon, it's sunny out, I'm wearing a baseball cap, I have facial hair, and I'm driving down the interstate blasting AC/DC Shoot to Thrill. Everything is as it should be. 

I work for a beverage vendor so I don't drive as much as you guys do here but I do the out of town route so I drive more than anyone else in the sales center but it's still only about 2 hours total per day. But when I do get to be on the road, I love it. 




 I keep getting the same thing from my parents that going to college is the best solution and I'll be guaranteed money. Even after telling them of people I knew who had pretty difficult degrees still working only a few dollars more than minimum wage after years, they think they're isolated incidents. Reddit has a pretty big user base with varying degrees of success in their lives so I'd like to try to make a chart of the data to present to them. 




 Working for a beverage vendor. Pay is kinda decent. I'm just wondering what other kind of jobs are out there for A CDL driver other than long haul. As much as I'd like to do long haul, I have a bad problem with driving drowsiness. I don't want to put others at risk because I can't drive more than 2-3 hours without getting tired no matter how much sleep I get.

 I can't find any recent information about the sick beard anime branch and it just looks abandoned to me. I also found there is a plugin for XDM but I can't even figure out how to get XDM to work on Windows. 




 I'm not really sure what good brands are to look for. The fans are about 1.5" x1.5" in dimension and have 2-pin connectors. 














 I think that the problem is that the software raid isn't initializing fast enough so sab resets the folder to the default which is extremely annoying because I don't have enough space on that drive to even download an HD movie. How can I resolve this?

Since there's the possibility of wires changing, I decided to use decora style wall plates with keystone/quickport inserts in addition to a decora style hidden cable insert that will put wires through PVC pipe to where a cable box/dvd player/etc will go. I'd use the much cheaper keystone Cat5/6 jacks from monoprice but lots of reviews are saying they are too wide to sit side by side on the decora inserts so I'm stuck with the more expensive Leviton brand ones 




 I'm going to be helping my dad network his house while we have some walls torn up for a room remodel. The coaxial will run into the modem in the basement and then we'll connect that to a Wireless AC router mounted to the rafters of the basement in the centralmost spot of the house. After that I'd like to run to a large switch to send cables to each room of the house.

Wires to the top floor will need to be put through a wall into the attic.  There are three regular bedrooms on the top floor and I'd like to put two Cat5/6 to each of those rooms. The Master bedroom will have two coaxial, one on each end of the room, so in addition to that, I want two to each of those spots. I'd like 4-6 in the living room as well as 4-6 in two separate spots in another room which could become a home theater someday. [Here is a basic layout of the house](http://i.imgur.com/KpMlDXz.jpg)

 I think that HTC is acknowledging the issue. I called support and they are sending me an overnight shipping label and when they repair it they are overnighting it back to me. They didn't say anything about what I'd need to pay but I'll post again if they do want to charge me for the repair. 




 Has anyone had this issue? I have the Verizon model and the phone is probably a month and a half old. Never dropped the phone so I don't know how this could have happened :/ 




 I posted that I got the scooter here before but for a couple reasons I never got around to doing anything, not having the title, the money, or the time meant it took a backseat. I'm not sure where to begin with this. What are good resources to learn how to do maintenance myself?

Here's the condition of the scooter:

 I haven't dove into the world of NAS yet as it seems cumbersome to rebuild a RAID every time you add a hard drive and plug and play solutions like sinology are way out of my price range. 

I have a HTPC case about the size of an AV receiver so it looks nice sitting on the opposite end of the TV stand. I recently got some new hard drives for it to replace a 1tb and 500gb one so now I have three 3tb drives. 

basically I'm looking for advice on software raid and if it is reliable, like if one drive goes down, is my whole collection screwed? I'm getting real fed up with having to basically play Tetris with hard drive space with TV shows that are completed and shows that are continuing. I'd like to just have all 9tb as one volume so I can have one directory and stop worrying about running out of space on a single drive and having to keep transferring things. 




 Anyone experience this? I got the wife a Nexus 5 and while she can hear other people fine when on a call, nobody can seem to hear her on the phone. When I talk to her the audio seems glitchy and frequently cuts out. It almost sounds like she's in an area with poor service at all times even though she has adequate service. 




 Anyone have any decent experiences. Recently got the wife a new phone on straight talk and people have a hard time hearing her. I want to determine if it's just ATT giving straight talk lines low priority or if I need to replace the phone.

 If I were in Billings I'd go to Montana Jack's but alas we don't have one here. What's a good place to go to? 




 At first last week we thought that she was going into labor and miscarriage so we went to the hospital right away and they examined her and there was still a good amount of fluid and she wasn't dilated and they ran some tests and everything came up fine.

Fast forward a bit and her pains have been getting worse. She has had quite a bit of back pain as well as cramping pain and it's to the point where it's nearly crippling for her. She says it feels like her stomach is tightening and won't loosen up. We've tried calling the doctors and her OBGYN and it feels like nobody is taking us seriously. These guys are always like "call us if you have any questions or concerns" and yet we called yesterday and nobody answered so she left a message...no response. She called again today because it's worse and was finally able to get ahold of someone. The doctor apparently wasn't concerned at all and "too busy" to fit her in even though the place was empty when we stopped by the hospital today. All they had her do was a urine analysis to see if it was a urinary tract infection and then they would get back to her tomorrow (and we've already had a lot of experience with doctors at this hospital not calling us about test results). She doesn't feel that it's an infection though because she's had one and it didn't feel like how it does.

I'm at a loss at what to do because it feels like the people who are supposed to be helping us don't seem to give a shit

And in the case that for some godforsaken reason this amount of pain is normal (why would the body do this!?) What can we do to help deal with that pain?

She says it feels like her stomach is tightening and won't loosen up. We've tried calling the doctors and her OBGYN and it feels like nobody is taking us seriously. These guys are always like "call us if you have any questions or concerns" and yet we called yesterday and nobody answered so she left a message...no response. She called again today because it's worse and was finally able to get ahold of someone. The doctor apparently wasn't concerned at all and "too busy" to fit her in even though the place was empty when we stopped by the hospital today. All they had her do was a urine analysis to see if it was a urinary tract infection and then they would get back to her tomorrow (and we've already had a lot of experience with doctors at this hospital not calling us about test results). She doesn't feel that it's an infection though because she's had one and it didn't feel like how it does.

I'm at a loss at what to do because it feels like the people who are supposed to be helping us don't seem to give a shit

Amd in the case that for some godforsaken reason this amount of pain is normal (why would the body do this!?) What can we do to help deal with that pain? 




 It has been a long time so I'm sure there are bound to be lots of awesome mods and maps around 









 In addition to the thing just looking like it needs some work in general, last season I started noticing that one side will get hotter than the other, so I may have to replace the burners? I got the thing for free a few years ago and it was pretty much in the same physical condition it is now but it just needed a new starter and a regulator. I never did put in a new starter out of laziness and just opted for lighting it with a match.

But spring is here and I need a project to kick off the season. All the wood needs replacing and since I'm doing that, I'd like to have fold-up shelves ([Like this](http://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/mDbbdw-d9pe5fVqEG0rmoKg.jpg)) on each side to add some space since I'm in an apartment and don't have any type of table or space out there.

I'll also end up actually putting in that starter just because it wouldn't make sense to restore the grill and not put in the starter. I'd also like to add a temperature gauge, I know there are clip-on or temporary solutions out there but I'd like to have a permanent fixture.

[Here's pictures of the damage](http://imgur.com/a/y3xS9) 














 My family is still on regular family plans but we were probably upgrade soon and I just saw a commercial for the "more everything" plan talking about how you get 2x data. When I calculated the cost for 5 lines with 10gb of data on the share everything plan, it was $300. The More Everything plan is the same price for 5 phones and 10gb. What gives? 














 For me, intentional asmr videos just make me feel weird. I like it when it just happens. A lot of the time it's in unboxing videos, I don't know why. I just came across an "unboxing" video posted on this subreddit and I figured I'd ask if anyone knows of any good unintentional ones because the intentional stuff like tapping on the box for 3 minutes straight just annoyed the hell out of me  




 I've owned my Mustang since I was in high school, and admittedly, I don't know a whole lot about cars, and I also don't place a lot of trust into mechanics I don't know, and the one guy I do know moved across the country. I only recently hit the 100,000 mark and I'd like to know what I can do to take care of my car myself. 

A few years ago I also had this weird problem where my car would just kinda lose power while on the interstate. It happened during hotter weather and it would start up again just fine after 20 minutes. No engine lights or anything. Definitely wasn't battery because I could still use the electronic stuff, the engine just wouldn't turn over unless I let it sit for a bit. I've heard a whole range of things it could be, from the fuel filter, to the fuel pump, it could be sensors, or even vapor lock. I'm just afraid to dump a whole bunch of money into doing all that and never truly knowing if it's fixed or not unless I decide to go on a 6 hour drive in hot weather, which I'm afraid to do now. 









 What are your favorite places for grub?

So far all I have on my list is desperadoes, apparently they have good hot wings. The double front is also on my list, love that fried chicken. I might also go to five guys because I don't get to eat there ever. Any great local burger places? I want a delicious half pound juicy burger to fill my stomach hole.

Also since I'm already posting, check out the new subreddit /r/montanaearthporn and post your beautiful pictures of Montana. 




 I frequently see beautiful pictures of Montana but am always unable to find them whenever I want to show somebody the beauty of our state. If you take an awesome picture or come across one, or even a video, post it to /r/MontanaEarthPorn so we will always have the beauty of Montana at our fingertips. 




 I frequently see pictures posted across the different Montana subreddits. Post them here as we'll so if you ever need to show an unbeliever how beautiful our home is, you can find the best of the best within seconds! 




 First, I just want to say that you guys are great. I specifically visit this sub far more than other subreddits other than whatever is on my front page. A lot of what I read here inspires me to better myself as a person and with food. Granted my experience so far is in a corporate kitchen and I'm not given any opportunity to really create something, I have still gained a lot of knowledge of the industry and of food itself, for which I am extremely grateful. I've been able to expand upon the ideas I see and do my own thing at home for family and friends. I'm able to whip up dishes for my friends who say they still have dreams about how good it tasted without looking up any form of a recipe, I'm just putting ingredients together that I feel work well. I love the food industry and that's why I'm saying I'm only leaving for now, because I'll be back, and hopefully next time I will be doing what I do for my friends, except on a bigger scale, and for people I don't know.

The short of it is that in July, my wife is due to have our first child. At her job, she only makes just above minimum wage, and even then, her ability to work will be hindered by having a baby, so I've been forced to look for a better-paying job that has more family-friendly hours. I got lucky and I generally only work mornings, but there are still really busy days where I'll put in 12 hours, and not ever knowing when I'll be home for dinner isn't an ideal situation right now. But for me, the best part is that since the job I've been offered pays me double what I make now, I'm guaranteed full time hours and bigger/more frequent raises. On top of that, I'm off work at 4pm every day, and I have weekends off. With the extra money I'm making, I'll be able to pay off my own student loans much faster, and I'll be able to save up money to begin my own small venture. So this definitely isn't goodbye forever, and I'm certainly not leaving this sub because you guys are my brothers.

Thanks for taking the time to read all of this if you did. I'm basically writing stream of consciousness. I don't actually have any personal friends in the industry and nobody on my side of the family or my wife's really understand why I love working in kitchens and working with food so they don't understand how someone like me can ever truly leave. Though I'm still young so I have many years ahead of me.  
























 For those of us on Reddit who also go to Xerq 




 It's a pain in the butt to shave my own head so I'd rather pay someone else to do it. I'm looking for someone who will also do facial hair the good ol' way. 




 I watched some of the behind the scenes stuff on the DVD and Satoshi was often up late being the only one in the office slaving away at his work. Has anyone thought that he put "himself" into the intro sequence?

[Link to relevant part of the intro](http://youtu.be/uXCoXW8lr0k?t=45s)

I love all of his work, and I had no idea that he wrote World Apartment Horror, which I saw a couple years ago and really liked, until a couple nights ago when I looked up to see what else he did that I haven't seen yet. The loss of his talent in the anime world 3 years ago was incredibly saddening 




 Over a year ago he decided to start clawing a wicker chest we had and to try to stop that, we got a scratching post as well as a cardboard pad. It mostly got him to stop clawing the chest but now when he does his crazy runs around the house, he stops on the stairs and claws the sides. He knows he's not supposed to do this because as soon as he sees one of us he takes off 




 Yeah yeah blah blah new years resolution blah blah. A couple weeks ago I started feeling like I'm too lazy and nothing would make me happier than to wake up at the asscrack of dawn and get some exercise in before I go to work. When I was in school I did the same thing before classes and it was great.

So what's the best gym in Bozeman? My wife is still going to school and I thought the $80 per semester fee since I'm married to her but that raises the problem of parking on campus and needing a parking pass too. Bus isn't an option because I typically work at 8-830am and the bus arrives at campus at 7 at the earliest. 




 Lately at my job hours are hard to come by. They've dropped everyone to 4 days a week in prep and since business has normalized since our restaurant first opened just under a year ago, there's less to do in prep and as a result we come in later in the morning and leave earlier. 4 days a week is fine for me as long as I get 30 hours out of it but most days I only seem to have a maximum of 6 hours of my own work to do. Some weeks we're a bit busier and I end up with 30 hours and others it's like 25-26.

I have more than a few coworkers who bitch and moan about the hours but never do everything they're supposed to, and they also don't stay and help someone whose list is a bit longer. The last couple weeks I have resorted to being the only one who stays and helps and often that person will then ask if I just want to take over the end of shift stuff and they can go, which I gladly do because I hate working less than 7 hours in a day.

On too of that, nobody does the weekly cleaning stuff which I also end up doing by myself. I don't like doing all this but it's the only way I can make sure I have enough money to pay my bills. I've already resorted to picking up a second job in case they decide to drop us to 3 days per week. Unfortunately the second job doesn't pay as well so it's definitely not an exit plan if everything goes tits up.

I love this industry and I love the work I do but I don't like needing to scavenge for hours in order to support myself and my wife, especially with a kid due in 6 months. I feel like management isn't looking at my habits too kindly and think I'm milking the clock being there longer than anyone else all the time, even though I'm the one doing the work they want us to do.

Just needed to vent some place where people might understand. None of my friends have ever worked in the industry and I've never been the type to make friends out of coworkers (not that the chance has ever presented itself)

Thanks for all the hard work I know the rest of you guys are doing. This is my favorite subreddit to visit. It's like we're one big drunken family. 




 I can't seem to find the post about it, but I made a reminder for myself on my phone but don't even remember what the site was 




 I'm going to be upgrading soon on Verizon. The folks over at /r/lgg2 [gave a convincing argument](http://www.reddit.com/r/lgg2/comments/1szxe6/why_did_you_or_why_should_i_choose_the_g2_over_an/). Now it's your turn. I could compare specs and read reviews but I like to hear from people who use them every single day. Not people who get to play around with a phone for a week or two, write a review and move onto the next big thing. 




 I'm on Verizon and will most likely upgrading soon and I'm on the fence for what I should get but the G2 interests me the most so far. 




 I work in a kitchen and we get a fair amount of to-go orders, especially large ones that require entire gallons of soup. When there is a large order the person in charge of the to-go stuff is supposed to tell the kitchen staff about it and we get everything ready. When there is a large order like that, it takes away from the soup that was meant for the dining area so we have to make sure there is enough warming up so we don't run out for the guests.

However, one person has made a habit of not telling anyone about the giant to-go orders and putting them in the computer last minute as if they didn't require any extra attention than regular orders, and on top of that, she justs takes the amount of soup she needs from the hot wells that are there for the servers to get soup for the dine-in guests. She has done this at least twice now, and every time I don't say anything about the soup, I just refill the hot-wells after she's done and I let her make more work for herself 














 I first got "into" bitcoin about 2 years ago when bitcoin was about $5-10 each. I started mining with my gpu on slush's pool and got to 1 bitcoin and had it sent to my wallet. I then raised the threshold to 10 bitcoins, but I only got to 2.88 bitcoins before I lost my interest because at the time (and even now) I don't have a lot of money and couldn't afford to replace my gpu if it died an early life from being ran at 100% for so long, especially with bitcoins being as cheap as they were.

So here's where I made my 3 essential mistakes:

1: I didn't pay attention to what I was doing

2: I left bitcoins in the mining pool account

3: I didn't continue mining

I got a new larger SSD and backed up some stuff onto an external and wiped the old one for a fresh install of windows. I didn't realize that I didn't make sure to back up my wallet until months later, but by that time I didn't really care too much. I did backup my entire windows profile though (I'm sure you see where this is going). So I spent the last year and a half thinking that bitcoin was gone as I watched the price of bitcoin climb, climb, and climb some more, getting a little more upset at each hurdle, but still thinking "well at least I still have that 2.88 bitcoins"

So then I fast forward to about a week or so ago when bitcoin flew past 700+. I think "oh I should log into slush's pool" and what do I find when I log in? an empty balance. Somehow someone took my coins! Now that was really devastating, but I only have myself to blame for not making sure I transferred those funds to my own wallet.

But tonight I had a spark of dumb genius luck. I tried doing data recovery on my old SSD with low hopes since that computer has been in use for so long, the data has likely been overwritten. Obviously I found nothing. I give up and lie down in bed, but I can't sleep still. So I get up and plug my external in and start searching, and what else do I find but a bitcoin folder in my appdata folder, and what's this? it contains a bitcoin.dat! All this time I assumed that the bitcoin.dat was contained in the program files directory, not appdata! So first thing I do is backup my current wallet.dat, and put this one in its place and rescan with bitcoin-qt. After scanning, the program opens and my first 1BTC is sitting right before my eyes, back in my possession after all this time.

It's kindof a bittersweet ending, because yeah, I still am out 2.88BTC, and the full amount could have paid for half of the debt I'm in, and I'm sure if I waited out longer, I could have paid it all off in full which would have been great because all the money going towards bills could be put back into investing in bitcoin. But not all is lost, and I'm definitely being more careful from here on out. 




 I need quite a bit of space for video recording/editing and I waited until black friday deals to do it 









 Bosses wanted someone to do some extra prep work tomorrow to make sure we have most of our main sauces and soup made so we have enough to start the day with on Friday. We're closed on Thanksgiving so no prep work will be done that day so if I don't, whoever is in charge of sauces will have a real rough day. So instead of working a few hours at my second job and in general having a relaxing day before I spend a whole day in my own kitchen, I will now be bumbling into work at 5:30am, get off at 10:30, run to my other job, work there, and then be worn out and probably not get as much of my own prep work done that I wanted to on Wednesday.

I don't know when to stop working guys 



















 More specifically, using their $45/mo plan with 4G through ATT's towers? I'm currently on a plan with my parents on Verizon and I have unlimited data. The rest of my family want to use their upgrades and that means I'll lose my unlimited due to the share everything plans. So instead of paying more for less, I'm going to get the Nexus 5 and port my number to Straight Talk. I'm just wondering how the service is in the Bozeman area 




 Both Sprint and Tmobile are not available in my area. I'm currently on Verizon with my family, but my dad wants to switch to the share everything plan (and I'm the only one with unlimited data). So by that I'll lose my unlimited data and end up paying the same amount of money for less data. Straight talk has supposedly unlimited everything for $45/month which is only $5 more than what I pay now.

What would the process even be to switch from my Galaxy Nexus on Verizon, getting a Nexus 5, and hopping on Straight Talk and keeping my same number? 












































 Well in the long run it's better deals. Last time I was there I spent around $500 but I also got an Xbox so there's that 




 Yeah no kidding. Costco continues to save me boatloads of money  




 Thanks for the advice. We switched when we introduced rice cereal and it's been great 




 So do you mix a days worth of formula in it, keep it in the fridge and then microwave bottles of formula?  




 Well we've been using the Kirkland for a while. He's doing great with it and my wallet is thanking me 




 My son is just over 5 months. He's rolled a couple times here and there, and not crawling yet but socially, he's amazing, he will sleep through the whole night, and we've started him on rice cereal a little while ago and he eats like a champ. He's not breastfed anymore because the wife wasn't producing enough so it's formula until he gets real milk and food 




 Damn you brought back some memories with this one. I forgot about this show 




 You gave me an idea, mixing fruity pebbles into waffle batter  




 He still managed to instill fear into Republicans. My dad saw him on TV and immediately said that he's pure evil.  




 Call the pound or animal control. When I was younger our neighbors never controlled their dogs and would try to keep them in the yard but if they got out "oh well". One time they got out at night, got into our yard and attacked our dog. He died in my arms on the way to the emergency vet. Fuck people who don't keep their dogs on a leash 




 Which 3DS is that? I have a zelda one but it doesn't look like that  




 This is what I'm excited about. If I can get 24tb in my media center PC I will be immensely happy

Most android phones have nfc chips in them where you can interact with other things by tapped them. Most common is paying using your phone or tapping two phones together to transfer videos or pictures 




 There was too much fluff in the article and I found myself skipping around  




 Add in an nfc chip so I can connect by tapping and I'm sold on something like this. I've been using an audio cable for my old ihome for shower tunes

 My company insists on hiring schmucks without CDLs and then waiting for the several month process of them failing the written test two or three times, then waiting the month it takes to get the driving test scheduled and then them needing to retake the driving test 3 times. All of this is because being 6 hours away from the bakken oilfield, they can't pay enough to hire guys who already have their CDL. 

I agree with you. If the person I'm with doesn't already conceptually get how backing up needs to happen, I don't know how to help them. I'm trying not to be too hard on him because I basically was in the same boat as everyone else except I had my learner's permit when I was hired and having only little experience backing trailers up, I picked up on it quickly and I passed my driving test the first time just like with my written test 




 At my current resume job I've been tasked with showing a guy with his learner's permit the ropes of driving. My truck is the only truck in the fleet with an automatic transmission (fuck you, it's also the only one with working cold air) so their thought is to send some newer people with me on my route to get used to the trailer before being tossed into a manual truck. My route is out of city so there's also less traffic to deal with. (but honestly fuck those guys I learned on stick floating gears).

 Anyway, the first guy they had with me was great because he had already driven with trailers and had no problem backing up to docks. The most recent guy however, can't wrap his head around backing up at all. Constantly turning the wrong way and is practically at a 90angle before he pulls back forwards and tries again. I understand that not everyone picks it up as fast but this guy makes me want to pull my hair out. The only way I can get him to back up straight into a dock is if I give him step by step instructions on how far to turn the wheel, and for how long, and I don't feel like it's possible to learn that way but if I just let him try to learn from his own mistakes he just keeps making them and then getting frustrated and repeatedly slamming the brakes too hard and flooring the accelerator to pull forward. I've tried giving him every pointer I have and it doesn't work. After next week he's someone else's problem, thank fucking God. 




 It seems like Verizon is always the last though

 Reddit is fun is still my favorite reddit app 




 Stores and warehouses have more space for rotation. Home freezers are basically 3D Tetris to fit everything in 




 Kitchens generally go through product faster, have walk-ins that are easier to ensure rotation, and use quicker use by dates for product just to make sure it's not spoiled. I don't have an iPhone, but to me the draw is basically using it as a freezer inventory app. How many times do people go and rummage through their freezer and either proclaim they don't have any food and end up getting fast food or buying what they already have or finding something that has been there since the freezer was first plugged in five years ago?  It's a little but easier for upright freezers but chest freezers it's common to have stuff get buried and I think that's where this app can be most useful, knowing what's in it without digging it up.  




 I don't get it 




 I know, sounds awful doesn't it?  




 I've delivered to some places where the walk-in was like how you described, no special door to hold the cool air either, just a standard door.  




 The app is great. Much better than looking up the website if you're already out. 

If they want to push to get more people using it, they should try updating it more often. It hasn't been updated in over a year. While useful, it looks outright ancient. A material design update for Android would be amazing

If he came in not high, he was cranky as fuck and always got frustrated and messed up dishes because of it  




 I'd buy him a drink 




 Don't forget that the nemesis system isn't as active and evolving as the ps4/xbine version  




 Yep. I bought an Xbox One assassin's Creed bundle at Costco for $329... The same price as all the black Friday deals. The only one better is getting a $50 gift card from Target but it's nothing worth waiting in that huge like for. Skip the lines, buy at Costco 




 Would you prefer a YouTube video with a 30 second it to, music added to the entire length of the video and someone who keeps turning the camera back to their face for way too long far too many times? I think vine is the perfect no-fluff way to show what's going on.  




 I KNEW being poached was a real concept. I'm a delivery truck driver now and one day when I came out of a store two guys got out of their vehicle and approached me. Basically wanted to poach me from my current job, asking if I liked my job and telling me the benefits of theirs (but the yearly wage starting out would have been 10,000 less than I'm doing now). But whenever I talked to anyone about it and use the word "poached"  they kinda cocked their head and gave me the deer in the headlights look

 I don't know if you have kids, but if you don't, try to put yourself in the shoes of some of us who do. Ever since my son was born in July these kinds of posts are suddenly everywhere to make me paranoid of something happening to my 4 month old son and run my feels through the blender 




 The problem isn't really the indexer, the problem is a lack of dedicated uploaders. The majority of all anime posted on usenet is done by one guy. If you can't find something on fanzub, there's a pretty good chance you'll have to torrent it

 Oh man I remember that happening all the time back in the old days of halo 2. I'd have a group of friends in our party and one guy would always end up on the opposite team  




 I can't help but wonder how much piracy is really going on per capita than there used to be. Services like Pandora, Spotify, and Google Music are making a huge selection of music readily available at a reasonable cost (if you're paying for premium on Spotify or Pandora). I myself used to download all kinds of music, but having the access to a huge library of music that Google music has from home or anywhere really makes it worth the money for me to have. Now I don't have to deal with syncing music libraries or using up an obscene amount of space on my phone.  




 I'm not against the forehead ones but I've used the ear ones my whole life and my family has never had problems with them. Do the forehead ones work past infanthood? I don't want something I'm just going to use when he's a baby, I want one that can be used for years with everyone in the family. The only reason I ask is because every single one I've seen says "baby thermometer" in the title 




 Unfortunately Costco formula comes only in one size: bulk 




 My wife and I have a bad habit of losing those tiny digital thermometers and besides, I grew up with an in ear one so I think I should get one for my family. The only issue I'm coming across is that it seems every one has to use those disposable filters. The one my mom had never needed anything like that and it worked perfectly fine. To me it just feels like a cash grab, keep making money off of something that is a one time purchase. My mom's thermometer has lasted for over 24 years and I'd like one that will last me just as long without needing to still spend money on it. 

If the filters are absolutely necessary, can anyone fill me in as to why? 




 We've been feeding our 4 month old anti gas Similac because he gets pretty gassy and had a mild case of colic in months 2 and 3. When spending $60 at Costco for 2 containers of Similac (which lasts about 2 weeks with how much he currently eats) I couldn't help but notice the Kirkland brand for almost half the cost and bigger container size. Does anyone have any experience with their formula?

*update* we've been using it for about 3 weeks or so and he is doing great with it. Even coming from gas relief formula he hasn't had any issues with the switch. We're also using the Dr browns bottles which are great 




 Traffic was at a standstill going West a couple miles out from Columbus around 830 this morning. I sat in it for an hour before it got going again. That fucking sucked because I was making deliveries to Columbus and it put my day right in the shitter 




 That's a shitty plan. Straight talk is the way to go  




 Well Portal 2 is coded by a talented and experienced team. Minecraft in comparison was written by a single guy and it was an accidental success and after that it's just a few guys coding it.  




 Something that disappointed me was that your pet goes from being a legit party member in your group in Origins to being a simple ability in 2 









 Well the intention is for it to be a laptop replacement so the keyboard is an obvious buy 




 Thinking of an i7 surface and it looks like you can play a fair amount of games and stuff like photoshop, but I'm wondering about minecraft too as it is poorly optimized and I can't play it on my current laptop without overheating it.

 I second a layered coat. If not, another option is to wear a hoodie and then a light rain jacket over it to keep the wind away as well as keeping your hoodie from getting soaked if it rains or snows. Gloves are good too to keep the hands dry when you're scraping ice off the windshield. As for myself, I skip the hooded coats and wear a mad bomber hat or beanie

 Okay but I gotta go to court tomorrow for my DUI and then the next day it's my turn to watch my kid and my ex lives 2 hours away so I have to get permission from the police to drive that far from home and then next week I'm going to a music festival that I got some sweet drugs for that I need to use 




 I thought that was my job 




 I don't think we'd all fit but I'm sure all of us together would make a pretty kickass restaurant  




 I just bought one because I didn't know what was a good brand. My hands get dirty at work so I figured the coating wouldn't last very long 




 The one I got said there was an anti fingerprint coating on it which was complete BS because it smudged the second I went to use it  




 I use it with a tempered glass screen protector for screen protection.  




 I'd love to use that but it seems that everyone's solution to the IR blaster except for supcase is to just leave the power button exposed which is an awful solution for my small hands

 That's the ultra hybrid one I found lol 




 Do you have a link to the slim hybrid? I can't seem to find it  




 
1. Thanks I'll take extra care for that bit

2. Hmm I've never heard anyone say they had that problem with the slim armor case before. I'm not worried about bulk because it looks about the same as the supcase I already have, and I like the look of the slim armor. I'd get the ultra hybrid because I don't drop my phone but I drive a big rig so I don't want to risk it falling from that height without proper protection. 

3. I don't exactly like the look of full body skins, I was thinking something clear. I'm just worried about scuffing my phone while it's in the case because the one I'm replacing got scuffs from the supcase

Thanks for the tips 




 I loved it because it gave me more of a feeling that he was young and cold blooded versus his more sympathetic self in lotr 




 I'm getting my M8 replaced because of a cracked camera lens. Since I'm doing the advanced exchange program I will be losing my tempered glass screen protector, just the price I pay for not wanting to be without my m8 for lore than an hour. 

I currently have the supcase because I thought I would end up using the IR blaster a lot but I haven't been at all so I'm ordering the spigen slim armor case and a nilkin tempered glass protector since it also comes with one's for the camera lenses. 

That leads me into my question: what about full body skins? Even with my supcase on, dirt and dust gets inside and I have scuffs on the edges of my phone that I'd rather not have. Anyone use a full body skin in addition to a shell case? 




 Yeah I've experienced similar and heard the same. Nice people running the businesses. I deliver West of Billings though, so I don't have to deal with the grumps here. I feel like the closer you get to billings the more ornery the people get 




 TIL there's a mascot of the year thing  




 Also no truck drivers  




 Crow Agency by comparison is a cake walk. I've dealt with nicer people there than  I have in Billings.  




 And then on the southeast side is crow agency. Same exact deal. One of my old coworkers rescued a pup from there. Lured him into his delivery truck and took him to the vet to get shots and whatnot  




 I'm heights and I'm definitely only 30, just checked. I guess I'll have to call

 The HE machines I have now seem to work fine but I don't work in a kitchen anymore so I'm not sure. I'm iffy on these HE machines though. I feel like they don't use enough water to get some really bad dirt out  




 Could have been that too. We used the old crappy machines that kept breaking down in our apartment complex  




 Ah fuck well you got me there. I wouldn't want ride a bus or train smelling like ball soup 




 You have to wear alternate clothes between your house and work? If that's so that's is bullshit.  




 It's awfully nice of your employer to provide a locker room for you to change your clothes in. Oh wait, they probably don't and you're changing into your work clothes in the bathroom. Do you change back into your "Street clothes"  after you're good and greasy after a long shift? I go home and shower before I contaminate anything else because that's disgusting and why do I need to soil two sets of clothes? For professionalism? I think you have that backwards unless you park underground and have a secret entrance where customers don't see you. Some restaurants make you walk through the front door. I think it's more professional to show up ready to work. But yeah you have fun changing in that handicap stall or better yet, the tiny stall if the handicap one is taken.  




 Maybe that's what I was missing because I used plenty of detergent and used two fabric softener things in the dryer but by the time I went to go out the pants on for work they smelled like Olive Garden still  




 I don't even work in a restaurant and I know how this feels. I work such long hours most days that I come home, shower and go straight to sweats or pajama pants. I own several pairs of regular pants but I only seem to wear the same shirt and pants because by the time I go to wear them again, they've been washed and are the first things I grab from the drawer and closet.  




 Space Frog: Space Mission

 I haven't looked at the app but an idea that would give them incentive to update the list is that there could be an option to enable push notifications for every time a brewery updates their list. That would guaranteed that if it isn't seen, at least someone with the app would be reminded of said brewery, instead of the off chance they visit the website or Facebook decides to show them an update on their feed

 As someone in Montana, I've never used snow tires on my Mustang and it's my only car so it gets use all winter 




 1997 Ford Mustang  




 Basically yes. All the super expensive biked are basically meant for professional athletes, the lighter the bike, the less movement resistance they have.  




 After the 500-700 range you really don't get better durability with bikes, it's all about weight of the bike  




 As someone living in Montana I actually find it difficult to tell who is a hipster and who is a redneck sometimes  




 Even better if they're just what you have on hand. They'll match the furniture by not matching anything  




 Which is weird because mason jar everything was a redneck thing  




 Ah, I was wondering what the hell kind of bridge blocks water from flowing  




 What bridge is this?  I've never heard of such a thing  




 Laziness breeds efficiency  




 Imagine the frustration of teaching them how to use the safety as well as trigger discipline.  




 And the amount being used by your company are all relatively trained with firearms. I can't imagine how much would be used training a ton of primitive people who haven't even seen a gun before  




 In all honesty any decent place you find will be fine. I've seen some shitty ass apartments with decent heat in them. My recommendation is to find a place with a stove or fireplace. Firewood is relatively inexpensive and then you only need to use the gas or electric heat as backup.

 Yeah and 60 degrees is cold for your Santa Monica ass 




 Porn with multiple locations is pretty fancy  




 Would a regular drill press not work? I mean I can literally put any bit into the chuck 




 I almost bought the dremel press thing, but I opted for a regular drill press because I found a used one for a great deal. It also doubles as a rotary sander, and the guy included the stand with it. Takes up more space but totally worth it for the versatility. I only have a tiny space to work with so having two bigger tools in one is great  




 I notice this about every "moving to montana" post. People acting like the person is moving into the winter apocalypse. My parents got me chains for my tires years ago but I haven't used them in over 5 or 6 years because I haven't needed them, even with how bad the last few winters were. I've never worn boots unless I'm hunting, I dress in pants, a t-shirt and a decent coat and I've only recently started wearing a hat now that I've elected to shaving my hair.

Winter is doable without having extreme gear but I suppose it may be necessary for people not used to the cold weather up here since how temperature seems to be perceived is relative to what you're used to 




 But also be aware of how deep the ruts are, don't want to get high centered 




 I lived in an apartment with baseboard heaters for over two years. My electricity bill was low (even with running 2 computers continuously) and my apartment was always warm.

I had friends who didn't use their heater and used portable heaters and I hated going over there during the winter because it was too damn cold. 




 I think the most adorable tool I've ever seen was an attachment to make a dremel into a mini drill press 




 Wow this looks really cool. I like everything but I don't think the tub fits in. With all the effort you already went through with the tile, a matching tile tub would have been awesome. (probably not comfortable though)  




 This is what I do 




 No kidding, I always go and never find anything  




 Even more disgusting is the limitations set on how much of the supplies teachers can use and many end up spending out of their own pockets to provide for their students. Meanwhile millions goes to facilities and buying brand new computers every other year.  




 Yeah it seems like the Jack is slightly too big. I bought an audio cable from monoprice and it doesn't stay in my phone, but my older cables I have fit just fine 




 I was going to say Streamline Late night is most reliable but then I realized today is Wednesday and they probably unfortunately aren't running  




 I would argue that a chef is anyone who has control/collaboration/contribution to the menu. 

A cook is someone who just follows instruction without actually really knowing the cooking process like production line workers. For example, is an assembly line worker for something like a car a master mechanic who knows how to build or fix any part of that car? It's just simple tasks that can be repeated over and over quickly without any thought.  




 I wanted to start making a rubber band ball from all the asparagus that we went through but I could never get anyone else to contribute so I have up

 That sounds amazing. Two topics I don't generally like talking about to other people and a society where where they don't talk about them to each other 




 So basically what you're saying is that with most lodges, people who practice one of the many forms of paganism could possibly be welcome? (seriously asking)  




 Thanks. I was also looking into locking casters because I also have a small work area. My toolbox is on casters and can be moved. 

We also looked at a bench at Sam's club. Basically it's a nice big flat top with metal supports and legs. Half of my toolbox can roll underneath it, the other half I'd have to mount on a board with casters to fit it underneath. 

The pros are it would free up some workspace having the toolboxes underneath it, and it's obviously sturdier. The cons are that I'd have to drill my own bench dog holes, get my own vice to attach to it, and with the legs being metal, I might not be able to attach casters to it 




 This is definitely the way to go. You don't want to just have the wires going directly from the switch, into a hole in the wall, the  out a hole in the wall and to your device. It's probably also against code so if you were ever looking to sell you'd have to fix it anyway, might as well do it right.  




 Halo channel is one of the worst apps ever. Today I was watching spartan ops videos and after a video was over, the next episode was on the screen for me to immediately play so I played it, and the fucking audio was in Chinese or something. I went back through the unintuitive menus to select the episode again and then it was in English  




 If you want bang for your buck get inquisition as it's the longest game ever 




 I haven't done it yet as I've lived in apartments but a future project in my parents house will be just that. We did a complete remodel of one of the TV rooms and set that up for multiple cat5e cables in two areas where they could possibly hang a TV. The house has a specific design where we are able to run several lines through a pipe into the attic from the basement and from there lines were dropped and pulled down to the top floor rooms where there are existing phone or power lines. The rest of the house aside from the one that was already torn up can have lines be pushed up from the basement. In most houses you would end up needing to tear up sections of your drywall and repair them to run cables.  




 I just don't know how it can be programmed for so many variables like that. Just in my small town, there is parallel parking downtown, and some side streets have diagonal parking along the street. Then there are limitations on how far away from a corner you can be, or you can't Park in front of a fire hydrant, or there could be an alley access. Unless there is a universal parking method everywhere, I can't see the possibility of taking the human out of the equation.  




 I did that a few weeks ago. It said I'd get updates by email and I haven't even gotten anything saying it's being reviewed yet  




 So what about roads not marked or incorrectly marked roads on Google maps? Google nav always directs people the wrong way to my house because one end of my street connects to another road but is closed off by a gate only for emergency vehicles, but there's no indication of that in Google maps. And what about driveways or residential parking?  




 This is why I haven't done one here yet. I did one on a smaller website and my santa got my 6month son a new outfit, my wife a gift card to nordstrom, and for myself, a few things from my amazon wishlist, like curry powder, a doorstop alarm, a magnetic fridge newton's cradle from think geek, and a fucking rc quadrocopter 




 This is my ideal setup but I've been living in apartments so wiring isn't an option, but it's essentially how were going to wire my parent's house  




 Both will work fine honestly. It's unlikely that you'll need cat6 in the near or even far future but whoever owns the place after you might be grateful  




 I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be looking at here 




 Where your coax line comes in for the Internet, you'll want a router. If it's a convenient location you can have a wireless router there. Then from that wire you'll want to connect to a gigabit switch and then from that switch you'll run cat5/6 to all your rooms. If you need more devices in certain rooms you can either run multiple wires or you can have a small switch in the rooms you need more wires in. Myself personally, I'd rather have a big switch and run all the wires to it rather than have 4 switches. Yes, you'll need power to the switch. Just remember: only one router. 

The common setup I hear of is having a non-wireless router where the coax comes in, and then you put one or two wireless access points throughout the house from the switch.  




 Thanks for pointing that out. I didn't know there was a standard for bench dogs 




 Yes it is  




 Thanks for the tips I'll check them out  




 So would you recommend it for that vice alone?  




 You're right. 

My problem is I'm still building my toolset and I don't have a lot of skills yet. Have a link to any plans for a good workbench for a compact place?  




 What's up with the placement of 10 of the bench dogs? They aren't aligned with the vice

 I have one of those spatulas, I like it but it gets a little sketchy with how small it is considering I make 14" pizzas  




 Those cutters are nice to have. Not as much dragging the toppings around like with a wheel. I like having a big one though, I have a small light one and I have to use it slow, unlike the big ones I uses to use at the pizza place I worked at and could cut a whole pizza in like a second 




 Care to explain for someone who has never owned it?  




 Your itty-bitty little kitty is kind of a dick 




 Goddamn that made my hair stand up 




 What is this even from?  




 I can't believe I watched that whole thing and I regret none of it  




 I agree. There's no excuse that Dragon Age Origins can have a skill wheel to access every one of my skills but not in Inquisition. The quick actions are nice for real time play but it's nice to have other less use abilities at my full disposal  




 I think it's crazy that black cats are harder to adopt. I adopted a black cat, not through a shelter, but from a family that had not been properly taking care of him. He is literally the best cat anyone could ever have 




 Looks like Kaarma is getting some karma 




 Yeah I'm pretty sure it's locally known as the Sheraton because that's what it used to be and people still call it that  




 Scheels? I think you're mistaken, that is an Underarmor store 




 I'm in this boat. My wife's family has a dish they cook during the holidays where you toss pork chops into a crockpot with several bulbs of garlic and let them marinate for an entire day in red wine vinegar and then cook them overnight. The entire house smells of garlic and vinegar for at least 2 weeks afterwards  




 Ended up picking it up. I have an older harmony remote but since having a TV, Receiver, and two consoles with CEC, I haven't had much if a use for universal remotes 




 Little Ricky has hated swaddling since month 1.5-2. Sometimes sleep sacks work if we don't put his arms through the holes but a lot of the time he gets upset that his arms aren't free so the only option sometimes is to hold your hand there and keep him from knocking the pacifier out until he drifts asleep. We contemplated getting that thing we saw on Shark Tank which is essentially like a sleep sack but with no arm holes and just extra room where the holes would be so he isn't cramped up but I'll be damned if we have to spend $40 on something like that when we could buy a yard of baby plaid for like $5 and make one ourselves. Luckily it isn't big enough of an issue to resort to that 




 They got like at least 15 morale boost points bro 




 I would argue he was the first, second, fourth, and fifth army  




 I call him Ricky Bobby because when he's trying to sleep he doesn't know what to do with his hands. They gravitate towards his face, pull his pacifier out and rub his eyes keeping him awake and subsequently making him upset that he's not asleep

 It definitely helps having a significant other that makes money. I unfortunately had to leave the industry because I wasn't making enough money with my first son on the way and a wife still finishing her degree (that won't net her a good job anyway) and we both feel that it's best to have someone be home for him until he starts school. But hey maybe I'll be able to pay off my student loans and save money for a food truck... Someday  




 It's the only fitting end for a chef 




 I usually use recipes as a base guideline  




 It was awesome. Just enough to make it not taste like regular chocolate chip cookies but it was just subtle  




 After 21 years in kitchens, how is your financial outlook? Especially after 16 different restaurants. 21 years is about 2 thirds of most everyone's careers. When do you think you'll retire?  




 Please God don't leave Android out

 Oh wow I didn't pay attention to the title and actually thought the black bit was a silhouette of a space ship 




 It was basically made because minecraft was giving the cold shoulder to Windows Mobile  




 People still pirate PC games?  




 I don't mind it really. I remember Dragon Age Origins having an awful inventory and the original mass effect was a nightmare. I can definitely see the inventory being cumbersome on PC. I can also understand where they're coming from with the random valuables dropping from enemies. It always feels tacky to me when things like demons or mabari drop gold, so selling those for gold makes sense. 

That being said, there's no excuse for not having any sort of storage in your stronghold, especially for a game that requires you to collect so many crafting materials in order to upgrade potions, armor, and weapons weapons, as well as re-equipping any potion that isn't your standard healing potion

 Thanks for doing this 




 Anders was awesome in origins. Fuck what they did to him in Dragon Age 2 




 I think something I really miss is the quick weapons toggle in Dragon Age Origins. They combined a lot of the good things about both games but a few are still gone. I liked that I could have two different sets of weapons and skills equipped to the skill buttons so I could change weapon sets mid combat. Like let's say my rogue was sitting back and shooting arrows and suddenly I'm the target, I switch to knives and fight close combat now. Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I also thought origins had different arrows with different abilities you could equip. 

Another thing I miss is having access to every skill in your party via the skill wheel.  




 Tactical view is awesome as well. My only gripe about that though is that you can't move far enough away from your character 




 I find myself frustrated with many of the same things as him but I am really enjoying it. Having a lot of problems doesn't necessarily mean it isn't enjoyable  




 This was probably what I was going to do but I wanted to be concise lol. I've tried mixing in chocolate chips before and they all end up at the bottom so sprinkling is the best option  




 The first question you'd need to ask is if it's possible for him to work 50 hours per week. Overtime is becoming increasingly rare for hourly employees, employers would rather put employees on salary and make then work 60 hours per week since they don't have to pay overtime that way. 

Is 50 hours sustainable long term? The employer could say yes but then after a month or two decide to cut back.

Lastly, I feel there would have to be some compromise with your husband. It's great that you want to have more direct control over your child! But your husband is basically going to be working an extra 2 hours per day, so if he was 9-5, now he's working 9-7. I work 5 days a week but it's hours based on the work being done, basically I work until I'm done. I know what a huge difference an 8 hour day versus a 10 hour day can be. It feels like it takes longer to unwind at home and when you're finished with dinner it seems like it's bed time already. 

That all being said, I think having one parent being at home until they're old enough to be in school is the best situation. Daycares are so expensive and it seems like unless both parents have a good paying full time job, daycare isn't even worth it. My wife asked if she should go back to working but any money she'd make would go back into child care so I'd rather have her have all that bonding time with our son 
























 Yeah but now it's basketball season, and then it will be baseball season, and then there's constantly soccer... And hockey fits in there somewhere. And then every 2 years there's either summer or winter Olympics. What I'm saying is, there really isn't any peace for those of us who have no interest in sports 




 My wife doesn't wear her ring because her fingers got bigger and neither of us really want to pay to resize it. That's ~$300 that could go towards feeding our son 




 My wife and I would play two headed giant but both of us on separate teams. It's like being a swinger without having to have someone else's dick all up in there  




 I used to be subscribed there but it isn't as fun when it's just a bunch of people posting mildly uninteresting photos of their relatives and expecting someone to photos hop it into something hilarious. It's far more funny when stuff like this happens organically without any provocation  




 What are his best written sketches?  




 That psychologist sounds like he's full of shit. My wife was diagnosed by a psychiatrist and usually for the first session he schedules a 75 minute questionnaire so he can figure out the first steps of treatment for whatever he may think you might be. They ended up with a 3 hour long session because he wanted to know everything that was going on and felt very confident on bipolar 1 by the end of it.  




 It should also be noted how ridiculously expensive it is. Not for those with no or poor insurance coverage. If I didn't have insurance, a 30 day supply would have been $1600 




 Yeah we're setting up our bedroom to be a private space nobody is allowed to be in since it's pretty big. We don't have any private space in the common area because her grandmother comes up from her basement area anytime someone is in the common area. Currently looking for a TV and wall mount for our bedroom for us to watch movies and play video games and spend time together alone  




 I love you guys and that you're being as open as you are. There's only one thing that bothered me and I'm sure a lot of other people about jc2 that I'd like for you to avoid with jc3: retailer-specific pre-order perks. I don't mind pre-ordering games but I don't like that I have to choose which one to do it in order to get some specific item, especially if not all those stores are available to me 




 Her very first visit with her therapist they determined she was codependent. She got a book called codependent no more and has been working on it and for a while it got a lot better but then there were life situations that made it rear its ugly head again. Basically we're living in the same place as her grandmother, who was the one that raised her, and is incredibly codependent in addition to a myriad of mental health problems that she refuses to get help for because she says "she's beyond help"  but she also just views mental problems as beneath her. 

Anyway, my brother in law lost his job and moved back into state and we let him move in with us until he gets a job and his own place but for now it's nice having him around because he helps around the house and occasionally watches our 7 month old son. However, the problem is it multiplied her grandmother's codependency and the wife has been in a prolonged mixed state/episode (we've discovered hers last for a really long time, looking back after the diagnosis and subsequent psychiatric visits) so she's leeching the codependency. Then after that, my other brother in law who is only 17 suddenly flew up here because he wanted to connect with his biological dad who he never really knew and again, further intensified the grandmother's codependency. 

We're doing our best to work on the codependency and unfortunately we're not really in a place to permanently fix the problem  




 Thanks I didn't know about that subreddit  




 My post was just as choppy. Just weird stream of consciousness. Thanks for the candid advice, I really appreciate it. Since you are in a relationship, have you done any couples therapy? We haven't been at it long, but it has been really awesome so far, especially with building a toolset on how to support each other. We're doing imago therapy which is more than just going to a therapist and just talking to the therapist about how we feel. The therapist is there to just give ideas and prompt conversation with the two of us and help us along. It sounds like you guys have it together but it's something I think can be helpful to a lot of couples even without problems  




 I started reading a book called "Loving someone with bipolar disorder". 

I don't know what I'm doing like at all. She's been going to a therapist for months, and we both go to the same one for couple's therapy. She's a great therapist and I'm glad we found her. It's actually a really funny story how my wife found her. She had made a therapist appointment and actually ended up at the wrong place in the same building complex. By some weird stroke of fate, the therapist had someone with the same first name cancel an appointment at the same time. 

Last month she recommended a psychiatrist to her and he got her into a question session to find more out about her and diagnosed her with bipolar, and put her on a slow titration of lamictol, which she had taken in the past and worked well for her. 

He also gave her something for her anxiety which didn't seem to work. Made her irritable for half the day because she had to take it before bed to help her sleep.  Now he put her on something newer, I guess called latuda and she only just got that yesterday. I can't believe how expensive that shit is. A 30 day supply was $1600,and my insurance required doctor authorization before they'd pay for it. Thank God they did because that helped a LOT. 

I'm just talking and rambling, sorry. Those of you in relationships, what do you want/need from your SO, and for those of you who aren't what would you want? 




 Wife stopped smoking since being diagnosed with bipolar and found it has been causing rapid cycling, even when she used hard-core put you on your ass asleep stuff. She'd be real upset the day after. Any other random stuff would bring manic episodes  




 Do baddies follow you through a wormhole?  




 I'm finding that farming does nothing but clutter my chests and ice boxes. It's so random what you get and doesn't seem worth it for now few and far between dragon fruits are. I'm fine with having a bunch of berry bushes to use as filler for my meatballs and that way I only ever need a few food ingredients.  




 What's a good way to restore sanity? I made a bunch of nets to catch butterflies and plant flowers but I just hit my second winter and don't feel like I have enough to last the winter. I spent a lot of time just standing near my fire to get sanity  




 I know about kiting and all that but I can't seem to do that when I have 5 hounds chasing me I don't seem to fare so well. The last two times I had hounds they happened at night so I didn't have anywhere I could really go and ended up running around my camp fire until dawn so I could run towards the pig houses which are also next to spider nests in order for them to have them fight each other. The last attack I barely survived by the skin of my neck and was going insane by the end of it. 

I was able to make 5 tooth traps after the last attack but I fear that won't be enough. There's a beefalo herd through a wormhole right by my base but I don't know if I want to take a sanity hit right before or during a hound attack. What I'm most worried about though is night attacks 




 I'm not sure but I've never had to kill more than 4-5 each day and by the time I kill more my naughtiness is reset again 




 I disagree on rabbit farming. My home is next to a bunch of rabbit holes and granted I'm only 40 or so days in, I've survived almost exclusively on meatballs made from rabbits and whatever filler I find and an occasional meat stew when I happen  to have actual meat. I have 30+ rabbits at any given time in my chests and can go out and collect about 2 days worth of food any time I go to the traps 




 ITT: tons of movies I've  never  seen  




 The article didn't really seem to explain very well, but what it looks like is Samsung is inserting ads into apps ran on the smart TV itself. If you are using an external device to watch something you should be fine.  




 How were you watching it? Was it through an app installed on the TV itself or was the hard drive connected to a computer that was connected via HDMI?  




 When I was a kid my mom made lunches for me every day except maybe once a week she would let me have a hot lunch at school for something I really liked on the menu or a special occasion. Back then I wished I could eat the school lunches more but looking back I'm glad she did it that way and I'll continue that with my family  




 Don't buy this game, it will consume your free time  




 The console bit wasn't directed at you personal, I'm honestly just wondering because it seems lame that they wouldn't be able to see their status. 

I can see where smarter crock pot is good to use because honestly, I'm either going to look at the wiki or use the crockpot simulator app on my phone for recipes. 

What does the non deployable mod do?  




 I think the minimap is great, and actually could could make things slightly more difficult while seeming to make it easier. Think about it. You're running around and then press the map button. The game is paused while you stare at the map and see where you need to go. But with the minimap, you glance up at that but don't pause the game. It's almost an unnoticeable amount of time but time still passes where it wouldn't have looking at the regular map.  




 As I said below, I play from the couch and use a controller so I can't over over my health or hunger or whatever. How has this been dealt with on the ps4 version? Do console players just get to miss out on ever seeing actual numbers?  




 I'd love this functionality. Having to craft a farm and then use the farm in another recipe to make an advanced farm but if you placed the farm already you should be able to add the required materials to the placed farm to upgrade it.  




 Don't forget additional structures. Made by the same guy and balanced just as well. Doesn't add anything ridiculous that doesn't seem like it wouldn't belong in the game.  




 I use always on status because I use a controller and thus cannot hover over anything with my mouse. 

In addition to that, I have a mod called additional structures. It adds some bigger and metal chests that I feel fit the balance of the game well. I also have craft able tunnels which I have yet to use. 

I would say anything that is cheating would be stuff that increases your stack sizes, or something that adds a backpack slot. I know that I should be able to wear a damn backpack with a coat but that's not how the game was designed/balanced.  




 Are there any plans to progress this game beyond small scenarios? Like being open world and actually creating your own castle and raiding other people's castles? The game is in what, alpha? And it's already so beautiful. It would be a shame to be limited to small scenarios  




 Alternatively there's a chrome extension  




 I personally like meatballs. Honey nuggets are good too if you have bee boxes. I just finished my first winter and I basically ate nothing but meatballs using rabbits save for the couple times I got some monster meat and killed a beefalo or two for fur, then I did meaty stew. I never went below 30 rabbits in my chests at any given time 




 Yeah I don't have the expansion so I just have the two seasons. I didn't know that until halfway through my winter in my current game. I was running around in a panic trying to figure out what I need to do and gather so I can be ready for the hot summer because of all the things I saw on the wiki and what I read here.  




 Do you have the expansion? There is apparently one boss each season in the expansion but just the deerclops in the original. I actually had the deerclops appear at my base at the end of winter. My screen was shaking and all I saw were it's legs at the top of my screen and I ran for my fucking life and forgot the food I desperately needed from my crockpot. Luckily I ran to where I had rabbit traps and ate some of them 




 I'm on my second attempt at winter right now, and I have an awesome placement minus not having bees nearby. Right near a wormhole that leads directly to beefalo, which is worth the sanity penalty, especially when I get my butterfly farm in order this next summer (I don't have the expansion). There are several pigs and sliders not too far away, I'm near a big tallbird nest if I want that, and below me is a plain with plenty of rabbit holes that ha e been my source of food pretty much this whole game. Right now I have about 40 or so unmurdered rabbits and at any given time I can go out to my traps and collect about 2 days worth of rabbit for meatballs. 

I cant wait for winter to be over though, about halfway through I unwittingly activated a winter trap so I get an extra long one 




 My wife does that basically. She keeps badgering me to build drying racks. I suppose they're great for preserving meat and saving space on not needing as many chests, but I've been living with a single crock pot all winter so far without problems  




 Why hello there, me 




 How does this ha e anything to do with technology?  




 Thanks for actually showing me something. Looks like the ones near me are staying open for now  




 I tried searching Google but I found a bunch of click bait.  




 There a list that isn't so shitty? Maybe one that lists by state?  




 Some people use a controller so we're unable to mouse over to confirm  




 Is this a thing? My son is 7 months and for the second time in around a week just before he fell completely to sleep he started screaming bloody murder but wasn't really awake and crying. Usually despite being hard to actually put to bed in the first place, he sleeps pretty well. It seems that every approach to calm him down including letting him try to self sooth just sends him further into the frenzy 

Anyone else experience this and have insight as to what I can do?

 You probably got plenty of money's worth with the game on PC, what would be their incentive to give the mobile version of the game to you for free? Why would they want to develop a mobile version if they didn't intend on making money from it?  




 I realize that I can use the keys to keep it shut but I open and close this thing upwards of 15 times a day,ibxant be fumbling with a key each time  














 Even worse are gut farts. When your intestines make uncontrollable noises that sound like farts. I always seemed to get those when I'd be in the completely silent computer lab 




 When I worked at olive garden, we had what seemed like 4 menus going at the same time. One was just that, a menu with little to no description, just pictures. And the items on that menu always sold the most. I always called it the dumb people menu because they can just point at the picture.  




 Steam doesn't link with Google play or the app store so it's not likely that getting the game for free if you purchased a steam version will ever happen.  




 Well it's highly situational. If I did a job where I was able to spend 5 or more hours per day listening to podcasts while I work then I would be all for that. I'm a delivery driver who has to merchandise my own product, and luckily my route takes me anywhere from a half hour to an hour and 15 minutes out of town so I do still get a bunch of time to listen to stuff, but it only amounts to about 10 hours per week. I like to keep a variety of podcasts in my Playlist but I want it to match the approximate time I am able to listen, that way I don't get behind on them. I only ever really listen to them while driving for work and don't go out of my way to listen to podcasts at home because my computer time is few and far between anyway at home that I try to spend time productively when I do have it. 

I've considered headphones but cables always seem to get in the way doing this kind of work 




 I hope to god if they do that it doesn't end up as another 3-4 hour podcast. I like the podcast and all but one podcast is already around a third of the time I have each week to listen to podcasts 




 I subscribe to /r/games and obviously this sub. I directly subscribe to specific game subreddits that I'm interested in. Other than that, I listen to the GiantBomb Podcast while driving. I drive about 10 hours per week for work and luckily my work Truck has an Aux port for the stereo so I've taken to listen to a bunch of podcasts. It's nice to not have to take the time outside of work to catch up on the rest of the world by listening to podcasts, otherwise I'd be stuck listening to all the same songs the radio let's me listen to 




 We started noticing a flat spot on his head around 2 months or so and we've tried to keep him off his back as much as possible but early on he hated tummy time and it was hard to keep him off his back short of holding him all day long until it was bed time. 

We got to a point where he could stand tummy time and we keep him sitting up since he can do that on his own now. He isn't crawling yet but he rolls from his tummy to his back all the time so there's still lots of spending time to make sure he's not on his back but there's still the 10 hours of sleep each night he still spends on his back and I feel that it had countered all of our attempts at helping the flat spot. 

Is there anything that can really be done at this point? I keep reading that it should have rounded out by 6 months and that helmets don't really help at all. The wife is a little upset about it because she mentioned it to the doctor a couple months ago and he said it wouldn't be anything to worry about but at the most recent visit he brought up the flat spot and mentioned wanting to look at it again in a month

 Most likely you'll end up in Mullan wing if you go to Johnstone. Pryor and Colter are 21+. The rooms are decent sized and you get the benefit of not having to go outside when you want to eat. If I remember right, they're separating North and South hedges from connecting to their dining hall directly. 

Other plus sides:

* pickle barrel is across the street 

* Joes Parkway is across the street

Downsides:

* you have to walk up that long hill for class every day

* abysmal parking  




 You don't need a cat tower. Yeah they're nice but you can build your own if you have the tools or materials. Alternatively you can get boxes, attach them together, find scraps of carpet, even ask a carpet store if there are garbage pieces you could have, and attach that to the sides of a box and you have your very own cat castle

 What I said was only the Cliffs notes version. It's actually a little more complex. The final stream is rendered at 24fps. Main objects are animated anywhere from 8-12 fps and secondary objects 6-8 fps 




 Animes usually run around 12 frames per second. In animation studios, artists create key frames every x amount of frames and then basically interns draw up everything in between. The person that did this essentially created all the key frames. What you're asking is that the person draw over 720 images for about 2 minutes of video to make it smooth

 And then raising prices while limiting promotions and wondering why the sales staff are incompetent because these are great prices and there's no way that higher prices will cause sales to drop, right?  




 Maybe businesses should be liable, but fellow employees should not be punished as well. When I worked in a restaurant, we had about 150 employees. Are you suggesting that 150 people should take home only 3/4 of their normal monthly income as a result of the actions of one or two people?  




 I have several thoughts/points:

* Kramer should be charged with negligent homicide. Even if she didn't know he was in the bed of the truck when she drove, it was still her direct actions that caused his death. 

* serving alcohol after 2 is a bad idea, even if it is a stupid law

* the laws concerning serving intoxicated people really don't make sense and as far as I'm concerned, takes away the responsibility of the person consuming the alcohol and places it directly on grocery stores, convenience stores, bars, and their respective employees. Having personally worked a job where I dealt with drunk people, the best way to cause a scene that would have never happened is to say no. Bartenders are not babysitters, they should only have to kick people out or cut them off if someone is causing problems. About 6 or so months ago an employee of the downtown Holiday gas ststion refused to sell alcohol to someone who came into the store. He left, but stayed around to jump the employee as she was walking to her car after her shift and hospitalized her. Money being spent to enforce these laws should be put to transportation programs that help intoxicated people get home from the bars.  

* one person screws up and the entire staff of three different bars/restaurants are out of work for three days. Most servers and cooks already don't make much and live paycheck to paycheck and now one paycheck this month will be halved. I'm imagining several employees struggling to make rent for next month.

 I was the sauce and soup guy, I frequently had nightmares about not having the ingredients I needed to get through the day because it happened often enough and the response from management was always shitty: I felt like I was bothering them with my shitty problem and most of the time they were apathetic about resolving it quickly. It would put me behind on my prep, and Lo and behold the first customer that walks in the door when we open wants a dish that requires the sauce I don't have and then the line is freaking out and then my managers freak out even though I told them I can't make it. One time we ran out of heavy cream and I couldn't make fucking Alfredo and I didn't even get the cream until a half hour after we opened  




 Do you know how to use tags and Playlists to make customers home lists for shows? I recommend looking that stuff up. I tagged all the kid friendly stuff as cartoons and tagged the anime separately,  then I made custom menu buttons that lead to those tagged shows. Then I made a smart Playlist that has all the TV shows excluding the shows that have the cartoon or anime tags, that way my TV shows menu has everything but cartoons and anime. 

You could do this same thing for your kids profiles so then they only have access to what Playlists you set up

 Someone mentioned this in one of my other posts. I kinda got used to/liked the harsher blue light 




 If any of you have seen my posts before, my original M8 has a cracked camera lens so I did the advanced exchange program. My first replacement (left) was distinctly not as bright and had a yellow hue so I called customer service and they sent another one (right) which is a little closer to my original. I don't want to do the song and dance of having to send in phone after phone after phone until I get one that looks "right" to me so I'm accepting the second replacement. I suppose after a day of use I won't even notice when I don't have a control to compare it against.

At one point I had all three phones so I had to take this picture because really, how often does a guy get to temporarily possess three HTC One M8's?. To compare the brightess I used a fast shutter speed and darkened the picture further

 I don't mind getting smudges on my hand, but what does washing your hand with dish soap do? 

I was more asking about how you deal with the spirals impeding your ability to draw without physical obstacles for your hand  




 I know there are vertical spiral books out there but the ones I found had less than half the amount of paper as the regular spiral ones. I'm sure there will be some drawings where I'll have the spiral to the top if I do a landscape sketch/drawing, but I want to pick an orientation and stick with it. 

The options I'm trying with is using normal orientation of the book but flipping the page all the way around and drawing on the back, or I can start from the back and work through the book backwards, or to keep the drawings on I guess "the front" I can turn the book upside down and work "backwards" 

What works best for my leftie family? 




 Idea of the year right here 




 So in the end I'm better off building my own boxes if I want them to last longer?  




 After being a part of this subreddit since before I bought my M8, I can't help but feel there is/was some QA problems in the manufacturing process. The M8 doesn't seem to provide the same experience for everyone across the board and there are many issues I've read that occur for some but not others. 

I've compiled a short list of the problems I've seen or experienced myself (and unfortunately I've experienced a good chunk of them):

* easily scratched camera lens that will cause blurry pictures

* the possibility that the lens can crack without having dropped or damaged the phone

* "loose" audio jack. Some audio plugs don't seem to make a tight connection with the audio jack and it's luck of the draw that what you have will work fine. Some cables or headphones will pop out of the last connection just enough that audio stops like you pulled the headphones out. Sometimes plugging headphones in will bring up the Google now voice search

* USB port becoming loose or damaged over time. Sometimes plugging a USB cable in will start dock mode, even if it's the same cable you always use that hasn't done it before. Sometimes the phone will get stuck in dock mode or USB host mode and refuse to charge. 

* notification LED. I saw many complaints about the led being nearly impossible to see. I've gone through three replacement M8's due to the cracked lens and then receiving yellow hue screen phones. Each replacement had an LED much brighter and easier to see at an angle than my original device.  

* different screen manufacturers. Some serial numbers have a brighter blue hue to the screen with more accurate looking whites, and some will have a yellow hue. Most people don't notice this unless they've gotten theirs exchanged and happened to look at the two side by side 

Feel free to add anything I missed. What are your thoughts on what happened with the manufacturing process with this phone? What symptoms have you experienced yourself? What issues would you like to be resolved with the impending M9 or other htc flagship? 




 How do you mean shot? They just fell apart? I feel that if I were to use them I'd throw some screws into the corners for reinforcement  




 I have that same 5.1 logitech speaker set. Still going strong for what, around 10 years now? Pretty darn good bang for the buck. I think I bought the set for $55 new. Last summer I saw the same set in a pan shop for $50. After seeing that, I knew I wasn't going to find any good prices at that place and never went back 




 I couldn't really explain why. It's just that if I were given the choice of any other fish at this time in my life, I would choose Steelhead every time.  




 And that's the only reason it's happening: The government is heavily subsidizing the development. Without that, there is no incentive to do anything because there aren't enough people in rural areas for them to be profitable spending the money to dig the lines 




 IKEA definitely. 




 Steelhead is by far one of the best fish I've ever eaten  




 Mine is April 2014 so I'm not sure about the later models getting better screens theory you have :/ 




 The one I'm sending in is HT44 




 I recently exchanged my M8 using the Advanced Exchange program because of a cracked camera lens. The phone I received in the mail is distinctly warm in color, whereas the phone i was about to send in was cooler, and had more of a blueish color when looking at whites. I called HTC customer support and they had me return the replacement phone and they would send me another, but the one I just got today is exactly the same. I gotta say I'm a tad bit disappointed. I don't want to have to keep returning the replacements until they get fed up with me so I'm going to have to get used to it and say goodbye to the one I'm sending in.

Did anyone else get their phone replaced and noticed a different screen hue? 




 You're in for a treat. I have the M8 and absolutely love it. So far it's the only phone I've had that I didn't want to replace after 6 months  




 8 months ago I was struggling to pay my bills on time and was over $16,000 in debt.  I got a better job at the end of April and today I have $11,000 left to pay 









 I really like the feel of this. Good job dude 




 For the most part notifications aren't the problem on the M8. It's all the icons that have to be on the status bar at all times. Like having an alarm set, when nfc is enables, or whatever you're listening to music, the boomsound and headphones icons.  




 And honesty, that looks goddamn amazing for being over 10 years old.  




 Eve Online has gone through several graphics engine overhauls.  




 There's a lot of rural and empty space where it isn't financially feasible to dig lines to houses in the middle of nowhere unless it's a significant development so it's not surprising to me. If you live in a city there are good chances you have access to Charter which has 30mbit internet and up to 60 in some cities. 

No matter what state you live in, if you're in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, don't expect landlines to your house unless you pay out of pocket to dig them yourself  




 Even if you aren't manually twisting a handle to roll a window up, there are still rollers controlled by electric motors to move the window up and down so it still makes sense  




 Not even Google translate could decipher this website. Not very useful information for the majority of this subreddit  




 I'm sure someone will pick up the mantle  




 From the sidebar:

Q. I don't want your bot in my subreddit!
Certainly, I recognize that not every subreddit is a place for image_linker_bot. It already abides by the Bottiquette ban list, and deletes comments that end up with negative votes.
If you don't want any bots in your subreddit, I'd recommend taking a minute to add yourself to the Bottiquette list.
If you just don't want image_linker_bot in your subreddit, or don't want to do the above, just send a modmail or post here with the subreddit(s) you want the bot to ignore and I'll add you to the list. 




 I don't think it's the fault of the bot. The bot simply replies to any person who names an image in its repository where the bot is allowed to look  




 ... So is it using the right image or not?  




 Not pictured: The piles of bags of doritos OP went through to get a cut in one without it breaking  




 Well eventually sonarr will have movies. I'm in the same boat for movies. Couch potato was like entropy for me. It worked except when it didn't. Constantly crashed too. I don't really like using dognzb watchlists but it works for now 




 But it's not pay to win. This is how in app purchases should be done 
























 Never saw that before, pretty damn funny  




 Negative 




 No.  




 Negative  




 That's usually my philosophy. I don't bother with anything without an already listed price unless it's a necessity  




 Just found out they're around $1500.  




 Yeah, it looks to be mostly custom works so I'm sure pretty much everything is priced at "more than you can afford, pal" 

Then again they were at a trade show and to me it seems like most things at trade shows are either snake oil or highly overpriced  




 Probably the sharp ledges  




 It definitely depends on the state you're in 




 I actually like the controller but I don't use it on my PC, I was just charging it. Though I hope it's a bug that the xbmc team can fix 




 This is the future bro, 128 




 Prices are usually never listed at these shows for that reason 




 DC really is laying their TV show game on thick. No doubt to rake in what marvel hasn't already entirely consumed.

 I think the bigger issue with tinting is things like concealing weapons inside  




 Someone posted a link to a website that shows the inside. Look like Windows to me 




 Bigskybackyards.com 




 I'll ask on a local Facebook group. The place was so fucking crowded I just snapped a quick picture and moved on  




 TIL driverless cars don't have to adhere to window tint laws 














 I got myself some half-sheet pans that are normally used in restaurants. That shit made me super happy 




 Then on the other hand when they leave it up to the students to pick groups I'm stuck with the other people nobody else wants to be in groups with because I didn't have friends  




 Yeah, that  




 OP from Watamote would be great  




 I wish the dishwasher I had was that clever. Whenever he'd bring our big whisks back he'd just yell "buttscratcher!!"  




 Thank God. It was a nightmare dealing with Google+ for pictures  




 Goddamn I know your feelings on the swaddle blanket. I hear that all the time, but nobody knows how hard it is for little Ricky Bobby to fall asleep. If he's swaddled he was constantly trying to get out of it, but when his arms are free they're up in his face rubbing his eyes and pulling the pacifier out of his mouth and in general raising a ruckus. Once you spend like an hour arm wrestling with him until he falls asleep he'll sleep through the night but if something wakes him up in the middle of the night good luck and be prepared to not get anymore sleep until tomorrow  




 Now if only you could have a live video feed of that sweet justice  




 Exactly what I'd expect you to post  




 That would be badass.  




 You'd be right.  




 No buttons being held down. It was just sitting right side up and plugged in. I unplugged it and turned the volume back up, and then plugged it back in and watched the volume go down again  




 I thought I was going crazy because when I turned XBMC on it was as if someone was constantly holding the volume down button with another keyboard. Turns out, a plugged in PS4 controller does exactly that 




 This post needs more cross section pictures because I can't believe half of those are cake without them 




 Back when my siblings and I were younglings it seemed like baby proofing the house was much simpler: gates for stairs, keeping doors closed/locked, putting covers on the electrical sockets. Most households still only had one TV, and maybe one game system. Phone Jacks were easily hidden behind furniture or were high up on a wall to begin with. And we didn't even get our first family computer until I was about 5.

Fast forward to today, my living room has a TV,  an AV receiver, a computer for the TV, a wireless router, a modem, speakers and a subwoofer, an external hard drive that needs to be plugged in, and four game consoles. It's all in one area and I need two power strips to handle it all. Then upstairs, I have a computer desk with open sides and back so all the cables are exposed.

Basically I really need some protips to baby proof all these wires and cables before little Ricky Bobby starts crawling and wants to play with the wires 




 I'm not sure what you're talking about when you say South Dakota doesn't get enough love. Here in Montana, we tell people to go there and North Dakota all the time  




 Are we not going to talk about how the 5th version looks like Jennifer lawrence?  




 All the reddit meet ups I've been to here were good. A bunch of us did trivia night at a bar once. It's hard to get a bunch of people together with vastly different lives though  




 Well it only happened to me when in hangouts so I figured it was a dumb feature  




 I used to work with a guy who got high before work. I preferred it when he was high. If he wasn't he was a cranky bastard that frequently lost his temper and would fuck shit up. When he was high he was in a good mood and worked efficiently with enthusiasm  




 I built my own steam box before steam view as a thing, except it runs Windows and has all my other media center stuff so basically it's just my movie /tv/gaming machine for the living room and not really a steambox but best of both worlds.  




 Is your girlfriend Bill Burr? 




 I think it looks great. People are just mad that they didn't invent a screen that fits inside the phone but is actually bigger than the phone's footprint 




 Missed opportunity on having the light fade on

 Yes, some brands may be more reliable than others, some may have a brighter screen, and some may have better remotes (for those of you not using a universal one). But it feels like most of what will make you happy with your purchase are things you can't filter or sort by on Amazon or Newegg. If it's a smart TV, what does the interface look like? Is it snappy and quick? Or is it sluggish and burdensome? How customizable are the TV settings? How well does the CEC (anynet+, bravia sync etc) perform? Is that reasonably customizable or does it operate by the laws of entropy? How does the screen look if you're in a bright room? Are reflections a problem? 

My point is, I'm looking for a TV and sure I can find all the "technical specs" but I can't find human interface or experience specifications which is making it extremely difficult to choose a TV I want 




 Small world!  




 I think you hurt the dough's feelings  




 I still don't have lollipop... Fucking Verizon  




 No kidding, the only thing I have time for is taking care of my son, which takes away my money, eating, which keeps me out of shape, and my job, which takes away creativity. When I have any time to not do any of those I just want to take a rest 




 I'm not sure how I feel about this. I like K Rock despite the relatively small library of music they play, but I liked that there weren't any radio DJs to get in the way of the music. 




 sounds defective to me then.  




 Yet another great cover! 




 When did this start happening? How long ha r you had the phone?  




 I have this same problem with different headphone connectors. The audio cable I've had in my car for years works fine, a d the one in my work Truck works fine, but a new one I bought from monoprice for my truck won't make a solid connection at all. And I've had some headphones do the same.  




 Did Simmons talk about being into music at all in the QA? His role seems like it would be extremely difficult for someone without any sort of background in music performance. If he didn't have any experience with music that makes his acting performance so much better. Having done Orchestra and jazz myself had I never seen any of Simmons' previous roles, he would have had me convinced he was a director/musician first and actor second. His gestures, mannerisms, and movements were spot on perfect, including the throwing the chair bit. That seems to be a common trait for band directors.  




 Same here in band except my director actually did throw a chair at the drummers  




 One might even go as far as saying half of a decade

 This comment thread is enlightening  




 And the FDA tried to put a stop to it, but backed off thanks to public comments


The revisions also address the issue of the use of spent grains, which are by-products of alcoholic beverage brewing and distilling that are commonly used as animal food. Concerns were raised that the proposed rules would require brewers and distillers to comply with the full human food and animal food rules if they made their wet spent grains available for animal feed. Theupdated proposed rule would clarify that human food processors that create by-products used as animal food and are already complying with FDA human food safety requirements  such as producers of wet spent grains  would not need to comply with the full animal food rule if they are already complying with the human-food rule.

 Even if you don't hit very hard it will make them stumble. Being hit in the nose in any form sucks 




 This was my dad's advice to me except to not be the first one to strike.  




 Yeah sorry for all the typos and general stream of consciousness. I typed that from my phone after driving for an hour and a half at 730 this morning  




 I always make this recommendation because when I moved into Bozeman for school, a couple places I applied at told me they already had hired people that were starting in a couple weeks when they got in from out of state. That upset me a bit because I was there and ready to work immediately. 

I've also put in applications to places and not get a response, even while trying to follow up on them and have them end up calling me over a month later for an interview. 

It's tough to say what would be the best course of action if they're telling you to apply when you're actually up here. Like what /u/Croup-vandemar said, maybe don't mention you haven't yet permanently moved, but I wonder if it's worth it to book a flight to make an interview when you're not guaranteed a job. I feel like some places may be open to a phone interview, but like before, you run the risk of them passing and telling you to try later 




 Yeah but the problem is that the population is growing faster than  the rate of housing being built. And as I said, housing is only half of the problem. The other part is the quantity of available jobs and whether they can or are willing to pay a living wage, or continue to rely on cheap college labor  




 The college is causing a depreciation of both jobs and housing. Every year, they let more freshman attend, even though they don't have the facilities to house them and for the first month they'll stuff 4 students into what are supposed to be common rooms for the dorms. Then the next year those freshman go out and try to get am apartment off campus, filling up all the available apartments. Sure, there's always something for rent, but competition is nuts. 

When my brother was moving up to Bozeman for school, my parents wanted to save some money by having him basically rent a room from my wife and I. I was for it because we would be able to rent a place with more space for less money, but we never found anything and he ended up going to the dorms. That brings me to my next point: you might have to be willing to rent sight unseen. We found something that would work great and was the right cost, so we set up the soonest available appointment to look at it. The place went on the market the very day we called. The first appointment to look at it was in a week. We show up to look at it and nobody is there. We wait about 10 minutes and nothing. We called the rental agency and they told us they ready found tenants for that property, without even notifying the people who scheduled appointments to look at it. 

Now for jobs, demand for jobs is very high, again because there are so many students. You might get lucky because some positions might open up with students leaving for the summer, but don't expect to get paid a whole lot. Many companies are taking advantage of the cheap unskilled college labor. Why pay someone more because they know what they're doing? We can hire this other guy, and train him for less money because he's willing to work for cheap because he needs rent/beer money. Unless you are a professional, it's a little difficult to make a decent living out here. 

Anyway, that's my ranting and raving about Bozeman. I love the place but I moved to Billings for work because I wasn't making any progress in paying off my student loans there 




 I don't think there are any gas pumps with tap and pay at the pump. You're safe if you pay inside with card anyway. 

That being said, nfc isn't all that secure.  




 I'm in the worst damn state. I never see anything at all for sale ever 




 500-750 is the range for studio to 2 bedroom apartments around here with varying degrees of amenities  




 Have a job lined up before you get here. It could end up being some time before you're able to find a place to live 




 Social justice warriors  




 Jesus I'm not even very old and these comments make me feel old because I understand nothing 









 The email I saw was an internal GM Petroleum email sent to all the conoco stations in the Billings area, so at least one of the stations was a conoco in Bozeman, and since the readers were installed on the inside of the machine it would have to be any station that isn't open 24/7

Which store isn't what is important though, this can happen to any store or ATM  




 That's only because they messed with the inside. If it's one of the ones that fit on the outside and isn't instantly recognizable, chances are your card will still work at the pump  




 Yep, paying inside from now on 




 Saw a forwarded email directed to a bunch of conoco gas stations warning that there were skimmers found on pumps in Bozeman. Be on the lookout when paying at the pump, these devices are getting better at being concealed 




 And I'm willing to bet the only way to make it illegal is to piggyback it onto another unrelated bill 




 They're just sleeping  




 I fucked that up didn't I? Goddamn it. I always have that inner voice when I type the name that I used the wrong one  




 What is the difference between this and the original metal one?  




 Jesus, video proof?  




 [relevant how it should have ended] (http://youtu.be/v6OEChj-UiI)  




 I've always been a fan of Carter x O'Neil 

I'll show myself out  




 They were born  




 Hello there, fellow Montanan. Were you disappointed in the wreck like me?  




 I love these man, you instantly became my favorite YouTuber when I came across one of your kazoo'd videos. 

Do a slightly sped up version of the super Mario 3 theme! I think one of my favorite songs ever is a jazz rendition of it but a kazoo'd version would be amazing  




 He does lots of drunk videos and they look like a heck of a time 




 I love watching his vlogs but i can't stand his video game commentary anymore  




 And not only that, it spurred a fad where it seemed like every publisher started pushing games with proprietary controllers that would never be used again so they could cash in on selling meh games for $100+ like that Tony hawk game with the skateboard controller. People just got burned out about buying games you couldn't just use a regular controller with. 

Though now it seems they've moved onto things like Skylander where they can get kids to beg their parents to buy them these action figures that also double as characters in a game 




 If they really are working on a new rock band game, I really hope they're spending time on making the equipment look nice, works well, is sturdy, and can be collapsed into a smaller size. The guitars are fine but the drummers goddamn 




 I still love to have mine around. It's great for when you have company over and run out of things to do  




 Tell me about it. We got rid of our stuff years ago when we were living in a small place and didn't ha e room. Well now we have room and want to have it again and it's nearly impossible to find good equipment. Ended up spending a hundred bucks getting two guitars, and drums, all with the wireless receivers, and the guy also had DJ Hero with it. The guitars are in okay condition, but we can only use one because one of the wireless receivers is actually a rockband 2 receiver, and I don't even know about the drums yet because the usb connection to the circuit board on the receiver is shot so I have to replace that usb cable.  




 It's the same in that there's music you play in the game, but that's really about it 




 How would it affect people with THE CDL jobs?  




 You don't want currenc. It'd incredibly insecure and if there's ever a problem with getting hacked, you as a consumer have absolutely no protections because it's linked directly to your bank. Everything that credit card companies provide to you is lost if you use currenc

Edit
I'm sorry I just saw other people say the same thing as me already in a better way and I just added a shit post to it. 




 Have any tips for an aspiring DM? I'm just now getting into DD with a tiny (just 4 of us)  group of people. 3 of us have never done it before and our DM has never DMed before so I guess our sessions are really relaxed, and we're rotating DM responsibilities for each arc and I'd like to have a go at it 




 You're gonna go and talk about mass effect and not a single mention of Mordin? That's cold man 




 I can get behind this 100%

 Can we stop adding gate at the end of everything? It's not funny anymore  




 And I'm just sitting here with my 97 that's literally falling apart  




 PVC pipe all the way!  




 I'm no electrician and I cringed at that. I would have ran PVC pipe to separate all those cables end to end and so they aren't in front of or behind the insulation  




 This thread makes me glad I live somewhere that's civilized when it comes to snow 




 Jesus how many damn ovens do you have?  




 My problem with all the cases that don't cover the IR blaster is that their solution is to just put a hole there. The power button isn't exactly a big button and having to press a button through a hole with my small hands would be miserable. The only case I've seen that did what I liked is the supcase one. It has a clear button over the IR blaster. Why is that so hard for everyone else to do?  




 Part of him that's supposed to help him walk that wasn't doing its job anymore is helping him walk now whether it likes it or not  




 Found the thread 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1e7zz1/i_need_a_new_simple_hotdog_recipe/ 




 7th post down in a search for "hot dog recipes" I found the thread

https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1e7zz1/i_need_a_new_simple_hotdog_recipe/

I was bored  




 There is no proper way to put it in there because it's not supposed to go there  




 This is my fear for buying myself a nice knife for home cooking. My wife beats the shit out of the bad knives we do have and she'll get butthurt if I tell her she can't use my knife lol 




 Jus  the tip 




 We're your /u/cool_hand_luke senses tingling?  




 I feel ya there. The last restaurant I worked at I did a year and 3 months there. If you worked an average of 30+ hours per week between open enrollment periods you'd qualify for health benefits. Well I did get 30+ hours per week but the restaurant opened in January, and open enrollment ended mid December. Basically, no matter how many hours you worked, every person who got hired for opening the restaurant got screwed out of health benefits for another year. I had already been looking for a better paying job when I found that out but that only intensified my search. 

Now instead of barely scraping by each month paying only the minimal amount on my semi-crippling debt of $18,000 thanks to school, I've paid off $7,000 since April  




 For a second I was wondering why cool hand like double posted but you got me damn you  




 The funny part is that this rule was added BECAUSE someone made a call-out thread for /u/cool_hand_luke. It's just too perfect  




 God damnit I want to read that but I'll be fucked before I go look through someone's comment history  




 I like his sub, just not that bullshit like this gets upvoted 




 What did you do this time?  




 He's actually super crazy but acts normal when he needs to which is why he's a great actor 




 It really is amazing how the human mind can adapt. I would have thought a viking would be too busy smashing the computer with his war axe than learning to type  




 See, I guess I've always experienced TV because aside from optimum adding HD channels and charter adding more HD channels, I've had the same TV experience for the last 15 years. Nothing has changed there for me except that I only use TV at my parents place when we visit. I just get Internet  




 Yeah, optimum was providing 16/2 and when charter took over they upped it to 30/2 and not even 2 year later doubled it again. I didn't have any complaints with optimum but I'm really happy with Charter right now. MSU has shitty Internet.  




 Our area isn't part of the swap. The original company here sold to Cablevision and then Cablevision sold it to charter and I have a feeling it was because they weren't happy with how things are going.  




 This may be a new contender for best time OP delivered ever 




 Hopefully the only reason you're getting downvotes is because the game isn't available anymore because it actually was a pretty solid game back when I had my droid x2 




 Charter definitely seems to be the least shitty of the major ones. Though they keep petitioning Montanan government to waive some certain taxes that are levied here claiming they are a burden and Montana keeps rejecting it. I have a bad feeling that if they don't get their way they will sell the market to comcast. I haven't had any complaints with them so far since they took over from optimum/Cablevision. They recently doubled everyone in the cities from 30/2 to 60/4. It's by no means Google fiber but hey, it's Montana, at least I'm not mailing my reddit comments via pony express.  




 Sheesh. Yeah if I had four months I wouldn't be as upset  




 What in the fucking fuck am I looking at? Jesus if I got a part in a band or Orchestra and they handed something that looked like that to me I'd walk out.  




 God damnit I love this subreddit  




 Try that but with every single ship and you have tumblr.com 




 Same thing happened to us and we gave up on it around the same time. Sometimes it just doesn't work. I think part of the problem with us is that short tongues run in my family so he could never really get a good latch. Our son does great with formula 




 I don't like to, but I use a case. The phone is so damn beautiful but it's just as slippery. I was using a supcase but now I use spigen slim armor  




 Aside from people I text that don't use hangouts, I probably wouldn't use that feature very often as I already have a Gmail tab open all the time on my PC  




 How does this compare to using motioninjoy for the ds3? I hated the finicky software. Half the time it seemed like my controller wouldn't connect and it felt like there was noticeable input lag. In addition to that, needing to translate the onscreen buttons to be relevant for a playstation controller since games always showed the xbox buttons. 

I really like the dualshock 4 but I REALLY like being able to use the 360 wireless controller adapter and just turning the controller on and being able to use it immediately, wirelessly, and without any setup. Just the other day I discovered I could use the controller for XBMC, I hadn't even thought to try it 




 Risky click  




 Last place I rented we technically weren't allowed barbecues, but luckily everyone had one and the property management company and the owner never enforced it because up here grilling is an all year thing, even when buried in snow  




 I guess we'll have to watch for this. Our son won't sleep without a sleep sack. We have to keep arms inside of it because they agitate his face when he's trying to fall asleep and that keeps him awake and makes him upset 




 Probably whatever subreddits the creator set it to watch  




 Not fooling me with dQw4 




 I dunno, I'd like to see it with some dubstep
