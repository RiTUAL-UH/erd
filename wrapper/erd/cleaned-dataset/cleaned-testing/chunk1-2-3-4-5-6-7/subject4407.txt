 The first verbal conversations likely occurred between 2.5 and 1.8 million years ago and were about tool-making, a new study suggests. 









 The 3-dimesional photoboltaic or pv cell technology provides a new technique to increase the conversion of solar energy into electricity. This breakthrough is patterned using the light management principles in fiber optic devices, in which the 3D design is employed to trap sunlight in micro-photovoltaic structures where photons travel around until theyre turned into electrons. 














 Facebook users in the U.S. will soon receive Amber Alerts to help find missing children who may be located near them. 









 A team of chemistry and materials science experts from University of California, Santa Barbara and The Dow Chemical Company has created a novel way to overcome one of the major hurdles preventing the widespread use of controlled radical polymerization. 









 Data can be used to know where to add public transport and fix problems in roads, with project beginning in Boston 









 Australia has qualified for the Asian Cup quarter-finals after a scintillating 4-0 win over Oman. 














 Bedtime stories are invaluable for a childs development
Napping helps infants to develop their memory and retain new behaviours they have learnt, a new study from the University of Sheffield has revealed. 



















 Elsevier announces the launch of a new journal: Big Data Research

 METCO Global releases new series of nanotechnology children books by Mark Tomassoni to educate and entertain young readers about nanotechnology 



















 Scientists have demonstrated that a 2-D man-made material called a metasurface can perform spatial differentiation and integration, the two main types of calculus problems, when illuminated by a laser beam. 
























 Experiments led by Humphrey Maris, professor of physics at Brown, suggest that the quantum state of an electron  the electrons wave function  can be shattered into pieces and those pieces can be trapped in tiny bubbles of liquid helium. 









 Griffith University academics are challenging the foundations of quantum science with a radical new theory based on interactions between parallel universes.
