 just out of curiosity...did you do your own health plan or follow p90x? 




 I don't understand all the hate coming towards this. You started with an already slim figure so the results aren't as drastic. However, you can definitely tell they are there. Congrats on finishing the 90 days! whats next? Insanity? Another Round?  




 quinoa is not easily bought near where i live as there aren't of ton of organic stores and all the main stores don't carry it 




 Hey all: this is my second week of p90x. For the first week i just took a normal diet and put it through loseit.com just to see what my percentages were. I roughly averaged 40% carbs, 30%protein, 30% fat. Obviously the p90x fat shredder is 50% protein, %30 carbs, 20% fat. So how do i bring up that protein number in some practical ways?

Here is a sample day of meals for me:

* Breakfast:oatmeal
* lunch:ham and turkey pita with provolone cheese/baby carrots/and grape tomatoes
* dinner: white bean and garbanzo bean chicken chili(over minimal rice)
* snacks:almonds(roughly 20 throughout the day), spinach shake(this is my recovery drink: 1 banana, 1 scoop protein powder, 1.5 handfuls spinach, 1/3 cup almond milk, 2 tbs peanutbutter, ice)

also what do you look for in a protein bar? 




 Just did my second chest and back + ab ripper x workout...I increase my weight on lawn mowers by 10lbs and did everything but the mason twist in ab ripper x. Currently drinking my protein/recovery drink 




 ANd behold tomorrow is rest day and it is very good. lol. My legs are on fire! upper body not so much. I used this first week to get myself into the rhythm of working out consistently...next week should be no excuses! pushing my body to the limit! 




 Hey, I'm also am doing the program(today is my day 6) and I wanted to give you some tips. 3 pushups doesn't seem to be a lot. I would consider doing 10 but moving to your knees if you have to(this is what i do). Anything less than 10 and you will be resting too much and stiffen up. Also with the chin ups try to do negatives(use a chair or jump up to where your chin is above the bar and then release as slowly as you can) 




 basically i have one scv per a command center building supply depots at all times. 




 Do/Did you drink a recovery drink on yoga days? especially during the early weeks? I'm on week 1 and i don't feel like i worked out nearly close to as hard as the other days(mainly due to not being very flexible). 




 isn't that Katu? He does Playhem casting once a week i think. He even plays zerg at high level. I believe i watched him beat oGsIllusion the other night. 




 reply i'm on day 4 but i agree! 




 I'll be updating this occasionally with a log of how I am doing. Not sure if i should do multiple posts.

Today will be day 3 of week 1...tbh I've never attempted this exercise in all my attempts at p90x...I'm always so sore and quit...today..I'm still sore but i will do the exercise.

right now: 5 foot 11 inches @ 190lbs. Lots of stomach fat + no upper body strength. 




 its on esltvs site http://tv.esl.eu/de/vod/view/23547 




 I may be really dumb but I can't seem to find all of them. The take tv sight has some...but not all. Anyone know best place to get them? 




 The problem is someone bought p90x for me as I can not afford it or another one really :( 




 I'm a 23 year old male 6 foot 190 lbs. I'm not happy with my upper body muscle and fat. I've tried P90X a couple of times but everytime i start, by the 4th or 5th day my body is exhausted and doesn't feel like it can go anymore. What do/did you do to get past this hump? Or What did you do to recover faster? 




 but don't you have to buy the game twice to get a second account? 




 aka but the game twice. no thank you 




 always fun watching the lakers lose! 




 the problem with this is that the current metagame has terran going fast gas for both terran and zerg(reactor hellions, fast tank/viking, cloaked banshee) where as versus protoss you do either one or two rax fast expand(no gas) 




 Hey, Just a general question that I think is helpful against all races. How do you deal with random players? I have three distinct builds for each race i'm playing and I really need to know by 11 food what the other player is doing(so I can go gas first if terran). How do you approach Random?

EDIT:Specifically for terran 




 no. We had one computer. But i didn't want her using the same account as me/save file. So we had separate ones so we could each play the game at our own pace. She have her stats and I have mine.  




 i'm sorry i lived in a house where it was a luxury to get one game a year? Both myself and my sister needed to be able to play it without running over each other. 




 quick question people. I had a friend move into my house and they want to play starcraft2. Do they have to buy their own copy? That seems unlikely because of how many houses have multiple children 




 same here 




 Is anyone else having problem with ads freezing screens. Specifically there is a Nikon ad that never seems to close. I keep having to refresh the stream until i get a different ad 




 i suggest trolling back and reporting him for spam 




 why else do you think they were giving away free tickets? they weren't trying to be nice...they were trying to get people to show up 




  you should a)have scouted the 4 gates+robo(i think standard scan of your opponents main is around 6:30ish) b)still be able to hold it off(if you are constantly producing out of 2 rax(bc 3rd rax is getting an add on) you should have enough to hold. Plus your opponent is incredibly all in at that point(he can kill 10 of your scv's and it wont matter bc you have two base down). Use the scv's to soak up damage(right click autorepair when you pull them so they soak up even more damage). You should be able to hold. 




 definitely do the 1 rax FE against toss and just grab 2-3 bunkers if you feel in danger. 2 Bunkers/8Marines/3scv's per bunker on autorepair holds off a 4 gate. You should have a stronger army...don't let the protoss max! 




 what would you suggest in regards to add-ons and order?
 




 what would you suggest in regards to add-ons and order?
 




 yeah i was just so use to doing 13 rax that i auto did it without thinking. If i get the add ons and he is 4 gating dont i lose bc i'm not producing units for that minute? 




 nvrmind...uploaded  




 I also added a replay of both builds 




 replay added 




 where can i load replays?
 




 I'm in the states and lagging really hard 




 Their event went live over an hour ago to air the playoffs and all its been is watching Orb and Gretorp get set up and scrolling graphics. Incredibly unprofessional. You don't see other sports delaying their broadcasts by an hour without some explanation. Heck we don't even see other broadcasters do this. Ridiculous! 




 thank you! i started doing the one rax expand and i found out that if i can hold off a 4 gate(which i can with two bunkers and scv's set to autorepair) then i do much better/win the game :) 




 I'm a gold terran who can beat the occasional plat zerg and plat terran. I struggle against silver level protoss. Anyone have any tips. I open 3 rax into expand-mmm with vikings and ghost as neccesary and 3/3 ups. Still get destroyed by toss going colossi or DT's or anything

EDIT:Adding in replays for those of you that wanted it

3 rax: http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=242869

 gold terran/silver zerg

test_subject4671.465 




 So i was looking through the Open Bracket(http://s3.majorleaguegaming.com/2011-providence-starcraft2-open.html) and there are some sick matchups starting the day:

* Gatored(who beat Ganzi) vs Leenock
* EGMachine vs Nestea
* Spanishiwa vs TLO
* Losira vs colMVPsc
* Hero vs Keen
* Sheth vs Major/Terran/Princess/xSix[fillintheblank]


Personally I'm looking forward to Machine vs Nestea. I really like machine. Which of these matchups are you most looking forward to? 




 thank you! 




 i don't run adblock 




 I'm a MLG silver member and I can't  get a voucher for the event...any one else having same issues? 




 So i've been watching EGMachine and for the life of me I dont understand why he doesn't have more viewers. He commentates every single game and really interacts with his chat. Also, he seems to do well at MLG's beating players like Slush, Tyler, etc. He also keeps a pretty good schedule of streaming often.

 listen to this man. Battlestar Galactica is AMAZING 




 Hi! i'm a gold level Terran and i've been dominating TvZ using the MVP build. Here are some quick notes.

1.)you didnt expand fast enough. Using this build you should be able to throw down a little bit after you start producing Helions.
2.) only produce 4 helions. This is the amount you need to get map control. Remember, the MVP style is about not taking damage and controlling the map instead of causing damage via drone harass.
3.)Once you switch your 1st factory to a tech lab. throw down gas #2 and factory #2. I prefer getting  an early siege as opposed to stim since the MVP build has no medivac usage...you actually hurt yourself with stim.
4)as soon as your second siege tank finishes, float your orbital down to expansion(circa 7-9 minute mark), transfer scvs, build gas 3 4(2 workers in each), and throw down engineering bay for upgrades and turrets to defend mutas.
5.)now you can actually afford the 4 marines/2 seige tank/ 2scv/supply depot production you were trying to pull off. 3rd goes down around 11 minute mark which should also be when you make your first push. Keep marine behind siege tanks and have your tanks hot keyed to go into siege mode. AS SOON AS YOU SEE creep, seige up and take out 3,4 tumors. 

Thats all i can think of now. I may download a replay for you to see of me doing the build. Also, if you want to practice i play zerg as well test_subject4671.465 




 do you have an example (ie 2 rax into expand into factory or something like that) 




 hi all! gold level terran here. I'm struggling with the tvt match as i feel i really dont have a solid build or key idea. In silver league i could just mass marine marauder and get my upgrades to +3/+3 by the 16 min mark and win. Now in the gold league, other players macro is better and there is a significant use of siege tanks. I've been opening with a fast banshee build order:

10 supply
11 rax
13 gas
15 orbital
as soon as i have 100 gas-factory
once factory completes throw down reactor and starport
once starport finishes switch onto reactor...keep producing marines/tanks and expand...the problem is that even if i do damage (6 scvs) my opponents seem to be able to attack me and kill me.. any suggestions? 




 i posted this last night and got downvoted to hell :( 




 painuser was suppose to arrive at the airport a hour ago to be picked up by sir scoots...and no one has been able to get in contact with him. this all via dj wheat twitter. Just trying to get the word out there http://twitter.com/#!/djWHEAT/status/130110499521167361 














 Hello from a member of the ODU alumni! My entire starcraft 2 group is ODU alumn :) VT is cool..i guess  




 hey, if you want a practice partner i'm a silver terran test_subject4671.465  I would like some tvp practice :) 




 game 2 boxer vs alive: boxer went for a fake helion reactor into cloaked banshee build but alive had a viking out in time an took little to no damage. The rest of the game played out with alive macroing better than Boxer(who has floating over 1k gas during a good segment of the game). Alive eventually killed Boxer's 3rd and then pushed in with marine/tank for the win. Also boxer used the userid of JethroGibbs for this match WINNER:Alive 




 Split screen not working 




 i went on a losing streak this morning but i still am ranked #2 in a silver league and constantly playing gold players.  




 how do i post replayz 




 50-60 workers in my usual game with a 4th base up and saturated usually. not claiming my micro/macro is perfect 




 i do have an 80% win rate in silver lol..bout to be gold as soon as i play more games.  




 Hey everyone,

I keep reading posts here that say "blah you are only silver league, all you have to do is have good macro and you advance." With that said I'm currently sitting on the silver/gold cusp and i disagree. I'm doing builds versus each race(2rax vs z, 3rax stim mm push, fast banshee) and executing them really well and most people hold these off. I then proceed to have a 20+ minute game where the only time i get over 600  minerals is when i max(600 because two factory thor). So what's your opinion? do we not give the lower leagues enough credit?

EDIT: I'm not saying i'm the best..i'm merely asking if we give the lower leagues credit :) 




 hmm...maybe i'm too into soccer to be a good evaluator of this fact. I do know that ever Sat and Sun ESPN2 shows an EPL game. But i agree that soccer has a much larger following than SC2. 




 i watch a ton of soccer and have never seen a commercial interrupted game. 




 sports like soccer have 45 minute halves with no adds at all. They simply state "this match is brought to you my gatorade" or something like that. I could see it being the same. 




 test_subject4671.465 silver terran 




 I'm silver terran test_subject4671.465 




 Silver Terran who is on at random times test_subject4671.465 




 i mad i couldn't see the games 




 any hurricane survival guides for the people in raleigh 




 Well i'm silver league and like everyone said...its will eventually depend on what build you want to do... but honestly i would throw a nexus down as soon as i begin floating the minerals necc to build one...usually ends up working nice, at least for terran 




 that might be my problem then...i never repair. Thanks! :) 




 Hey guys...silver league noob here...trying to get better. Anyways..I'm really struggling vs protoss...i find the other matchups easy...but i literally can not figure out for the life of me how to stop 4 gate pushes...bunkers near the front of my base? they warp into the back..mass marauders-killed...mass marines-killed....rushed to tanks-killed...help please?

Watching streams doesnt help me bc pros dont forgate really in pvt or pvz

Edit:To THose asking about warping in back...warp prism . 




 Destiny advocates a one base roach push strategy to stop this. You overlord on 9, spawning pool on 12, gas on 14(3-workers immediately) as well as roach warren, get a queen, and drone up to 20/26..then non stop roach/overlord production..if he doesnt have roaches out you win...and if he does he can not stop producing them or you will win...and since you are putting pressure on you can use one of your drones to expand. 




 Hey everyone, right now i'm chillin in the silver league as terran and am doing okay. learning/getting better all that jazz. The other day i started experimenting with the other races just to get a handle on how to scout them/etc. During this i found playing zerg to be especially fun...enough so that i legitimately am considering switching. My one question is how do you determine the # of lings you need to make at any one point...i always seem to make too few and get killed by early 3rax/4gate plays. or if i try to do a roach build i always get cannon rushed by protoss. I find if i can get to late game i'm beating everyone...so anyhelp stopping these early game pushes would be nice. 




 honestly i was able to beat the computer on hard/very hard by just microing out marine/maruader/medivac....but that does not prepare you for the game...I think its much better to just play 2-3 games on the ladder every day...as you play you should start to notice good timings etc 




 I started out just like you losing almost all my games. I quickly got very frustrated. What i found out is that i just didnt have a plan, i was building units willy-nilly and losing. I would suggest Day9 Dailies 257,267,285,and 289. But honestly the most important one to watch and digest as terran is #312. Once i watched that daily it all clicked for me. I'm now residing as a top Silver league terran who should be in gold any day now. 
























 lol i feel like i should get an achievement. Beginning was filled with newness but by the end of the week i knew the workouts and was killing them... also I DID MY FIRST REAL PULLUP TODAY! 




 if you go to chick fila and get one of their grilled chicken sandwhiches that suppose to be good. Tropical smoothie salads can be good just ask for splenda instead of sugar in smoothie and be careful on dressings. Subway is fine but i would just tear a good section of bread off or get one of their salads 




 haha fair enough.  




 I played basketball and soccer throughout highschool and on an inter-mural level in college.  Every time I stretched before a game/practice. I ended up pulling something or having it tense on me. I also do find static stretching boring but i can deal with boring. 

I feel that for me going for a mile run or playing some basketball is more effective in getting my muscles to relax 




 yeah i knew I would get downvoted on this. I'm a big proponent of not doing static stretches...as I've only gotten hurt/tense through them. Since all Xstretch is static stretches i pass on it. I'd rather do more cardio. 




 i thought about it but i really need the ability to quickly change weights as I'm using them with p90x 




 Hey everyone,

i've been using these 25 lb adjustable dumbbells i got from walmart for most my work outs to this point. However there are already some moves(like lawnmowers!) that these aren't heavy enough for. My real life cake day is coming up so I'm trying to get some money for one of the larger selectable dumbells. Which is the best? Bowflex? My main priority is that i need to be able to quickly change weights and price is nice too
 









 i suggest not doing stretch x as who really wants to waste an hour of time stretching????????? But I'm probably in the minority on this one. 




 i wouldn't rest all together as i feel once you stop its really hard to start back up. maybe just lower intensity of everything(ie just do stretch/balance postures on yoga. on kenpo day go for a walk etc). But honestly thats just my thoughts. Only you know what is right for you. Listen to your body :) 




 i replace Kenpo with running the basketball court for two hours but I think that's a little different. I would not trade plyo in for anything as it is such a killer cardio workout. In the end i don't get to decide what is too much for your shoulders/arms...only you can. Standard exercise advice states yuo want to rest them after workout so they can recover....but shouldn't you be using your legs mostly in rock climbing anyways? 




 i mean if you measure the effectiveness of a workout via weight then that might be a good investment for you. I only lost two lbs in the first month but my body looked different. Its really up to you. :) 




 not even 1? not even on your knees? lol just messing. Do your best and forget the rest! 




 yeah...a ton of upper body muscle. My upper body was underdeveloped most my life due to playing basketball and soccer. I went from not being able to do a normal pushup to being able to easily crank out 20. 




 yeah

my menu for a week is something like this:

Breakfast for week: nonfat Yogurt + protein bar OR oatmeal with banana..on weekends i'll cook 5 eggwhites and have two pieces wheat toast

Lunch for week: salad with turkey/ham( i keep a supply of spinach leafs, tomatoes, carrots, and turkey/ham from the deli in my work fridge) with some super low fat dressing(i use a honey mustard dressing i found at my local walmart)

DINNER for the week:

Sunday: Cook a whole bunch of chicken breast(5). Eat one with some brocolli. Store rest in fridge. Monday: Take one chicken breast(precooked) and make a chicken chili with navy beans and garbanzo beans(this should leave a bunch of leftovers that you can eat on days you don't feel like cooking. Tuesday: One Chicken breast and saute with one bell pepper(like fajitas!) Sprinkle low fat cheese on top and serve with vegi of choice. Weds: Take one chicken breast, shred and mix with 1/4 cup bbq sauce(low sugar!). sprinkle with a little cheese. Place on top of wheat english muffins and bake for 10 minutes to make mini-chicken pizza's(2-3 english muffins cut in half should be fine) Thursday:Remember that chicken chili? leftover time Friday:cut remaining chicken breast in half. shred and serve on top of salad. Saturday: Finish chicken chili at lunch. Other half chicken used in dinner of choice

combine this with a post workout proteinshake/recovery drink and you should be hitting 1900 calories per day and keeping pretty close to the 50% p, 25% c, 25%f suggested by P90x. When I get tired of chicken I'll change it up by having salmon or turkey italian sausage or a turkey burger.

If i get a hunger urge I eat about 10 almonds and drink some water and that seems to work for me 




 thats probably a clue from your body that you are ready for the phase 2 diet! The feeling you described is exactly the point the nutrition book suggest you switch. Hopefully the increased carbs helps :) 




 I did a really good job bringing it during plyo today...i sorta died near the end but definitely did better than the first 3 weeks. I think substituting basketball for kenpoX improved my cardio by leaps and bounds...and allowed me to have some fun ^.^
 




 haha third base in bronze 




 I hold myself up for 3 seconds before letting down 




 my tip would be to secretly do classic while everyone else does lean ;) seriously though! the lean version just has more cardio and less lifting..but if you do light lifting at high reps your results should be awesome. 

My only other tip is COMMIT COMMIT COMMIT. This is a one night stand...its a full fledged workout relationship. Keep a diet, do the work and you WILL get results 




 i'm doing 25 now lol(and struggling with it). My birthday is in march and i'll probably be needing heavier weights around that time as i hope to be pulling 45lbs eventually 




 awesome! Looks like you've put on more muscle than me but i lost a similar amount of belly to you. Lets keep it up :) 




 Day1: 0 normal pushups(had to do on knees), 0 normal pullups(couldn't do a negative either), 15 lb curl for 12 reps

Day 27: 20 High/low pushups(from core synergistics), 25 negative pullups, 25lb curl for 20 reps 




 yeah i was using a chair at first but i realized quickly after doing a couple negatives that the chair was ez mode compared to negatives. I would rather do fewer reps and get a real workout.  




 yeah. I went from eating out at lunch every day and most weekends to only eating stuff i cooked. and following the 50%, 25%, 25% fat burner diet principles

EDIT: Funny thing is  my new diet is cheaper on my budget and just as tasty :) 




 to be honest I don't remember what its called either ^.^ i just know that p90x suggested 2400 calories for me and i've been fine with 1900.  




 to be fair its still negatives. i can only do half a real pull up now. but i'm getting closer every day! :) 




 I don't use their recovery drink. I use my own suggested by my best friend(who happens to be a certified trainer):

1/2 cup almond milk
1 to 2 scoops protein powder(1 on cardio days, 2 on lifting days or days when you need protein boost)
1 banana
2 tbs peanut butter
1 handful of spinach
ICE

blend and drink. It tastes good and is healthy. If you don't have a blender a lot of people suggest a glass of skim milk mixed with nesquik chocolate mix as that apparently has a good proportion to proteins/carbs for good recovery 




 Its in the Dvds as well as stretching. You may wish to prolong the warmup depending on age/body 




 I lost about 2 inches off my waste and 3 off my stomach. Weight stayed the same but I'm fine with that bc i'm gaining muscle. 

The 50/25/25 basically states that 50% of your calories that day should come from protein. 25% should come from carbs etc
I do this by keeping a log of what i eat at loseit.com and using their report to tab to show the amount I'm bringing in a day. Honestly, because i'm eating so clean...I feel like I'm eating a lot more and am not that hungry. I eat often in small amounts to fight off hunger.

my menu for a week is something like this:

Breakfast for week: nonfat Yogurt + protein bar OR oatmeal with banana

Lunch for week: salad with turkey/ham( i keep a supply of spinach leafs, tomatoes, carrots, and turkey/ham from the deli in my work fridge) with some super low fat dressing(i use a honey mustard dressing i found at my local walmart)

If i get a hunger urge I eat about 10 almonds and drink some water and that seems to work for me
 




 here is what four weeks of classic and eating right has done for me weight wise: http://imgur.com/yk91M

this is my third attempt(and by far the farthest i've gotten) and it was MUCH easier this time. I've got a little soreness but not pain. Hopefully thats what you are doing too.

I would say if possible follow the principles of the fat burner diet (50% protein, 25% carbs, 25% fat) as that is probably the most important part 




 yeah. I went from eating out at lunch every day and most weekends to only eating stuff i cooked. I also stopped the videos several times during to make sure i got my reps in.I think a lot of the change is from finding out what it means to push myself. I probably could have done more at the beginning but my effort wasn't there 




 Info that might be of interest:

same pants in both picture. Use to have to suck in gut to put them on, now have to pull them up throughout the day.

Day1: 0 normal pushups(had to do on knees), 0 normal pullups(couldn't do a negative either), 15 lb curl for 12 reps

Day 27: 20 High/low pushups(from core synergistics), 25 negative pullups, 25lb curl for 20 reps 




 but BMI is a measure of height vs weight...so it hasn't changed(its also why BMI isn't an accurate tool for measuring heatlh) 




 i just posted my week 4 pics and honestly when i look in the mirror i don't believe i'm seeing change...but looking at the pics the change definitely happened/is happening. I believe the rest week you should see changes because your muscles are retaining water because of how heavily you are working them out. 




 No weight change. 190lbs. But that is fine as you can see the fat difference. Also i've gained significant strength

 









 i mean my macro is far from perfect and i have super low apm(30 avg)...but then again i think i have good decision making...my win rate against zerg is very high(80 ish percent) and my win rate against protoss is decent(50-60%)...but I rarely win tvt because i'm not good at the tank crawl...hence my asking for a better build since early game can create a huge advantage for me that i can use to roll my oponent 




 what do you do against fast doom drops and/or fast thors as marines aren't strong against repaired thors 




 yeah i lost 5 terran games in a row using the thorzain expand despite scouting the one base play every single time and preparing before hand. the only one i won was when i played my normal tank/marine build

EDIT: not saying its impossible, just that i lack the execution to perform it 




 added you 




 yeah start whatever day you want...I started on a saturday so that I could have my rest day on fridays. 




 http://sc2ranks.com/us/2781279/test_subject4671

and yes i know macro can be improved etc...but i just don't like the max army tank/viking/marine play at the end. I can manage one base pushes now...they just don't happen as often 




 Alright guys, I'm having trouble with TvT...I have basically a zero win percentage. The problem i have is that I am terrible with marine/tank/viking late game pushes. I tried doing the thorzain early expand build from Day9 but that proved to be worthless against any terran who was doing a 1 base all in with fast siege tanks. What is a good build that isn't necessarily cheesy but i good early push in tvt? 




 yeah i guess i shouldn't say i'm anti stretching as much as i am anti static stretching. I usually do stretch out in a ballistic manner 




 my problem with cheese is that even if you do scout it a lot of times its very hard to stop(see 1/1/1 or 7 gate or 4 gatewarpprism) 




 I wouldn't give up man. Remember you are going to be getting progressively stronger throughout the 90 days.  The first day I wasn't able to attempt ab ripper x either bc i was so tired from chest and back. What i did is slowly work my way into it. Week 1 i tried to do 5 of each move. Week 2 i tried to do 6 of each move, etc. My last abripperx on week 3(i'm on rest week now) I got through everything but mason twists. 




 that was a generic week...other weeks i'll add salmon or ground turkey. 




 me: 23 yr old 5'11" and 190 lbs

Tuesday: One Chicken breast and saute with one bell pepper(like fajitas!) Sprinkle low fat cheese on top and serve with vegi of choice.
Weds: Take one chicken breast, shred and mix with 1/4 cup bbq sauce(low sugar!). sprinkle with a little cheese. Place on top of wheat english muffins and bake for 10 minutes to make mini-chicken pizza's(2-3 english muffins cut in half should be fine)
Thursday:Remember that chicken chili? leftover time
Friday:cut remaining chicken breast in half. shred and serve on top of salad.
Saturday: Finish chicken chili at lunch. Other half chicken used in dinner of choice


combine this with a post workout proteinshake/recovery drink and you should be hitting 1900 calories per day and keeping pretty close to the 50% p, 30% c, 20%f suggested by P90x 




 I'm a big proponent of not stretching as i feel it actually tightens my muscles and makes me more prone to injury. I played basketball and soccer in high school and never stretched before or after games/practice because i always injured myself in game when i did. That being said...I just did X stretch and I feel WAY worse/tighter than i did coming into the workout. Should i just skip this "workout" or what? I don't feel like any good is coming of it 




 Did core synergistics last night and OMG! is that hard....way harder than plyo in my opinion. tonight is suppose to be kenpo but i'll be stopping by the hotel gym and getting my cardio on there for 45 minutes. 




 i only want a little bit of weight loss....more into gaining muscle mass. but yeah i under stand what you mean 




 Week 3 Day 6. No weight loss but a change in muscle/fat composition of my body. I went from having no upper body strength(not being able to do a negative pullup) to better upper body strength(I did 36 negatives last night during the course of legs/back.  I've always been told it takes 21 days to make a habit so i guess the people who drop off after week 2 lack motivation/personal drive(I know i did when i tried before!) 




 i'm doing my best to. Obviously i don't hit the percentages every day. I've been using loseit.com and have been averaging 45% protein 30% carbs 25% fat ...with some days the carbs and fat switching 




 I try to push myself as hard as I can and still be able to finish the workout. I've gone from not being able to do a single negative pullup on day 1 to doing 6 per a type on back days 




 Today is my Kenpo day for week 3 and I shall be doing it as soon as i get home. I've got to say that I'm a little discourage by lack of visible results. But hey...as Tony says "Rome was built in a day and neither was your body". I've spent the last 2 years gaining 25 lbs and a significant portion of body fat...can't expect it to fall off in 3 weeks. 




 no problem! My friend suggested it to me and she is a trainer so i take her at her word 




 I've started the program multiple times before and quit by the end of the first week every single time. However, this time I sort of just went "f*** it" and decided I AM doing this every single day for 90 days. So far I'm on day away for finishing week 3.

The thing for me is I mentally made the realization that this isn't a work out class. This isn't fitness 101. I'm doing this for me and no one else. I want my body to be back in the shape it was when i played basketball and soccer in highschool. I want that energy. I guess what i'm saying is that I know in the end all the work i put into it is going to pay off into the body i want. 

EDIT: I also told a lot of people who i keep in regular contact with so that i know i can't slack off 




 yay! just a small note...i notice you said dvd's. If you keep the dvd in then it automatically plays abripper x after your standard workout dvds(chest/back,arms, and legs are all this way at least) 




 Well it depends on what section you are on of the diet. I believe the amount of calories they have you using on each phase goes up. So if you are still on Fat Burner(which you probably shouldn't be on for long) then you will go up soon. Also, remember that p90x is more for lean muscle creation than bulking up.  




 i've played LoL and I dont understand whats going on at all other than tower kills and player kills. 




 Plyo sucks it sucks it really really sucks. lol 




 this sounds like one of those time where it is best to consult your doctor.  




 Today is my rest day of week 2 as well. I've gained 1 lb in the 2 weeks so no worries there. The way i've had it explained to me is that the weeks 5-8 are the weeks where  you really start to see results. This makes me excited bc i'm already starting to see my body slim down! 




 try to keep the diet better. Diet is actually more important than the exercise(ie you can lose weight on diet alone). What I do is find foods i like that are quick to make. My dinners tend to be: 

* Sunday: Cook a whole bunch of chicken breast(5). Eat one with some brocolli. Store rest in fridge.
* Monday: Take one chicken breast(precooked) and make a chicken chili with navy beans and garbanzo beans(this should leave a bunch of leftovers that you can eat on days you don't feel like cooking.
* Tuesday: One Chicken breast and saute with one bell pepper(like fajitas!) Sprinkle low fat cheese on top and serve with vegi of choice.
* Weds: Take one chicken breast, shred and mix with 1/4 cup bbq sauce(low sugar!). sprinkle with a little cheese. Place on top of wheat english muffins and bake for 10 minutes to make mini-chicken pizza's(2 english muffins cut in half should be fine)
* Thursday:Remember that chicken chili? leftover time
* Friday:cut remaining chicken breast in half. shred and serve on top of salad.
* Saturday: Finish chicken chili at lunch. Other half chicken used in dinner of choice
 




 instead of a yoga block i just use my pushup bars 




 i use fresh baby leaf spinach. its pretty easy to find and pretty cheap. Just store extra in my crisper 




 Yesterday i did leg/back and i was pretty sore this morning. During work i ended up having to climb 4 [strads](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Containerlift_straddle_carrier.jpg/220px-Containerlift_straddle_carrier.jpg) which are about 50-75 feet tall.

When i got home today i pushed play on Kenpo, broke a small sweat and then got to the kicks and stopped(boo on me!). How would you suggest i make it up? Try kenpo again tomorrow? Go running? Or do you think the climbing helps make up for that 30 minutes? 




 after. I do my workout late afternoon so i've already got some food in my belly. I think if you preferred to do it before that would be fine 




 no way. Looking through the ingredient list you should be able to see that its no bueno. It contains acai berry which everyone thought was this super fat burner but eventually research found it burned lean muscle! you definitely dont want that. Just go with a regular protein drink. Much cheaper! My protein drink is to blend a 1 scoop(or 2 on chest days) of protein powder, 1 banana, 1 handful spinach, 2 tbs peanut butter, 1/3 cup almond milk, and a handful ice. It tastes delicious! 




 Finished Legs and Back about an hour and half ago. I have worked out every day! Yay me! I also did decently at yoga yesterday...i felt like i did enough work to use a recovery drink. I'm not as sore as i expect to be. Not sure if this mean's i should go harder. I got another Gold's Gym spacesaver 25lb single so that i can try some heavier weights on the upper body workouts. 




 Kenpo can actually be one of the hardest exercises if you are willing to "bring it" . To make this exercise killer act like you are actually a mma fighter(i call this the Clay Guida). Stay on your toes and do small bounces during all moves. This will keep your leg muscles constantly twitching and will tire you quickly! super fun 




 oh most definitely....but if you are doing fat shredder(50% p, 30%c, 20%f) then that oatmeal basically kills all the carbs for the day 




 thanks for the lunch idea! i actually did that today and put it over a bed of spinach leafs. 

any other breakfast ideas? I find cottage cheese and hard boil eggs gag nasty. It also has to be something i can eat at my office desk. Today i switched out the oatmeal for a non fat vanilla yogurt and that helped a lot on carbs but not so much on protein 




 as a guy who played basketball all throughout highschool this posts pains me. I'm sure that practically basketballs may work. I would worry about it though because that much pressure on any basketball is sure to warp and misform it...and at that point you may be doing more harm than good. 




 there is a couple of us(well me and occasionally other people) posting our daily progress at [r/p90xlog](http://www.reddit.com/r/p90xlog/). You should do so as well! 




 the only problem/biggest problem with oatmeal is the high amount of carbs present 




 is it bad i'm not sure what day i'm on? I just finished week 2 day 3(aka biceps/shoulders/triceps.) I had my recovery drink and a piece of chicken for dinner....and my arms already feel recovered....I wonder if i'm not pushing enough 




 when i replied there was only one thread and it was the one at bottom with a whole bunch of people saying she didn't look different and basically being asses to her 
























 i've had success with ripit4me and dvd decryptor/encoder 




 is there a GPU monitoring software/benchmarking software that you would suggest? 




 Below is the build i did. Twice I have been playing a game and gotten to a particularly intense part and my speakers have put out two hard beeps and then my screen turns pink with some static. I have to reboot the pc to get out of this state. Any ideas on what I might need to look at?

EDIT: Did some googling and found suggestions that this may be an issue with the latest drivers and that falling back to driver v295.73 will fix. Will try out when i get home and update this thread. 




 haha thanks...since then i finished all 90 days and strarted insanity 




 question:best virus protection software? 




 yeah got it working this morning..i removed the front panel for installation and forgot to reconnect the power coupling to my power button :-/ And I cleaned up the cables i promise! 




 yeah i definitely did...but i forgot to take a pic afterwards 




 i had no desire to overclock...i only bought the 2500k bc it was cheaper. As for the radeon 7850, that would have put me over my $1000 budget so I had to stick with the 560 ti. Same with the H61. If my budget was higher i would have gone AsRock Gen3 MoBo as well 




 So my laptop started to go on me last week and [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/onylq.jpg) is the pc i built to replace it. This pic is taken pre-cable management. Thanks for all the help from BaPC, especially from Thenecron who reminded me last night that I can indeed plug in my Sata cables into the connectors when i started panicing. I installed all the drivers this morning but haven't gotten to do any performance measures yet.

 i dont think so..i placed the reset connector where i had the power connected and that allowed the system to power up....the system is running fine..just no power button on the case it seems. 




 i connected everything up and it seems that nothing will start.... any help on this one? i thought there was a guide for this 




 yeah like i said i feel dumb about it. thanks for the help...now to figure out all the other wires
 




 i understand where the sata2 and sata3 connectors are...I was just trying to figure out if there is any reason to use the sata2(since the have slower speeds)
 




 First time builder and i think i'm doing okay so far...I'm using a Lite-On iHAS124-04 DVD/CD Writer with a ASRock H61M/U3S3 Micro ATX LGA1155 Motherboard....i'm try to figure out how i determine whether i plug into Sata 2 or Sata 3...I feel dumb..any help? 




 insane...like plyo on steroids 




 they actually suggest a cool down period...i walked around and ran for two days before i decided i was done resting and hopped into insanity 




 but wasn't parting really low on money? i feel like they pointed out that he was broke right before the engagement...i agree that parting had probably won...but then again i remember thinking goswser had beaten mkp once and mkp came back via micro 




 from what i can tell its a giant pyramid scheme...that being said....there still is the possibility of being successful in it. 




 I bought windows 7 OEM and the packagin suggest using microsoft's OPK...I'm assuming that this isn't actually neccesary. Can someone confirm for me? 




 O.o mommy i'm scared lol 




 i did pay with credit card 




 you know this how? haha gold level terran 




 I placed a $375 order with ncix for my i5,a 2 Tb harddrive, and my case on thursday. I've called them twice since then and they say they are getting to my order and i should get an email soon. However, all the parts where in stock and i don't get why its taking so long(especially since on thursday they told me it would be processed by friday). Anyone else have issues getting stuff from them? 




 i go to walmart here and don't even bother with coupons etc. what i listed covers me dinner and breakfast. lunch's i buy some deli meat, some salad, and lite dressing. maybe additional $10? 




 you can basically get a 5 pack of chicken breast, some fresh/frozen veggies, some fresh/frozen fruits, eggs, and bread for $30 a week and it should feed youmost your meals. add some tuna/cans of soup for the other meals and you can easily stay under $35 a week. 




 i've shared my results pics enough around here. i dont want to karma whore too much :P 




 and I started Insanity yesterday....Plyo looks like cake now. 




 yeah the i5-2500 was more expensive so I said went with the cheaper(but yet overclockable 2500k) 




 First time trying to/thinking about buying a pc. I mainly want the pc to be able to play sc2/Lol at high framerates. It also needs to be able to handle live streaming in HD and coding work. Any tips on driving the price down a little?

 [official p90x nutrition guide](http://www.teambeachbody.com/home/-/dl_get_file/32ea4c06-2287-4660-8adc-8db758929d28 ) 




 please let me know how this does especially with Sc2. Right now my current rig can't process even on low and that means i can't get past gold league :(  




 find a calorie tracking website(like loseit.com) and use that. The general idea is that as long as you it fits the macros(50%protein, 25% carbs, 25% fat that you can eat whatever and it shouldn't matter much. 




 I modify one handed by placing my hand close to my body for balance instead of behind my back. kinda like over under pushups in Core Synergistic
 




 i understand..that plyo/yoga/legs days kills your legs. While i wouldn't stop leg and back days all together(you do want nice calfs/quads right?) I would say maybe every other week ish wouldn't kill you 




 yeah. The fog might mean you want to up your carb and/calorie count a little. Play with that and see if it helps. As for getting your but kicked I'm right there with you. The way I look at it now is that I'm stronger/more endurance so I can lift heavier and longer which means I'm not taking as many breaks in the beginning..hence butt getting kicked 




 you may want to kill the pasta...especially late at night....various studies have shown that its best to get all your carbs in by lunch so that more fat is burnt over night.(also there will be no carbs for your body to turn to fat) 




 i found the best way to prepare for p90x is to put on some workout clothes, grab a bottle of water and a towel, and finally pop the dvd in 




 since i know the moves by heart i turn off the video and just start doing them at my pace. It gives me my rest time and means i get all the reps out 




 my advice is to be asian, find someone to cut your hair like his......but seriously diet and lots of hard work 




 the thing that scares me as a meching terran is fast hive. You have to remember that i can't be spread out much...so you can easily expand all over the map and quick drone/tech
 




 forget about looks just for a second...are you stronger? Can you do more reps/higher weights. Since you didnt start out fat the changes are going to be harder to see so you really need to focus on the strength numbers. If you aren't improving there then THAT mean you aren't "bringing it" 




 I just bout the 90lb power blocks....but that a really good deal so i would go with it 




 gold level terran an occassional LoL player...would be willing. PM for character ID :) 




 If ALL you are looking for is losing weight I believe Insanity is your option. P90x focuses on lowering fat by increasing muscle. Also, 2 weeks is nothing! as a fellow ADD person i can tell you that you need to focus your thoughts elsewhere. If you do either completely you will get results. Also, p90x takes 90 days with most gains coming in the last 30 minutes and Insanity only takes 60 




 that sounds like a lot of carbs. Are you sticking to the 50% protein, 25% carbs, 25% fat macros suggested? 




 loseit.com 




 at the time i was in phase 1 i was 190 and depending on the protein bar/yogurt/sides/protein shake it would fluctuate. That being said I went back to my food logs and I was getting 170-235g a day 




 There should be a post in this thread showing my stats as far as working out..I played 2 hours of basketball a day in middle school/highschool. College I gained 50lb(135 to 190) and worked my butt to get back down to 175. I was back up to 200 before i started p90x...now at 180

EDIT: as for health wise...I'm a cardio monster bc of sports but lack(ed) upper  body strength
 




 Breakfast for week: nonfat Yogurt + protein bar OR oatmeal with banana..on weekends i'll cook 5 eggwhites and have two pieces wheat toast

Lunch for week: salad with turkey/ham( i keep a supply of spinach leafs, tomatoes, carrots, and turkey/ham from the deli in my work fridge) with some super low fat dressing(i use a honey mustard dressing i found at my local walmart)

DINNER for the week:

Sunday: Cook a whole bunch of chicken breast(5). Eat one with some brocolli. Store rest in fridge. Monday: Take one chicken breast(precooked) and make a chicken chili with navy beans and garbanzo beans(this should leave a bunch of leftovers that you can eat on days you don't feel like cooking. Tuesday: One Chicken breast and saute with one bell pepper(like fajitas!) Sprinkle low fat cheese on top and serve with vegi of choice. Weds: Take one chicken breast, shred and mix with 1/4 cup bbq sauce(low sugar!). sprinkle with a little cheese. Place on top of wheat english muffins and bake for 10 minutes to make mini-chicken pizza's(2-3 english muffins cut in half should be fine) Thursday:Remember that chicken chili? leftover time Friday:cut remaining chicken breast in half. shred and serve on top of salad. Saturday: Finish chicken chili at lunch. Other half chicken used in dinner of choice

combine this with a post workout proteinshake/recovery drink and you should be hitting 1900 calories per day and keeping pretty close to the 50% p, 25% c, 25%f suggested by P90x. When I get tired of chicken I'll change it up by having salmon or turkey italian sausage or a turkey burger. 









 Info of interests:

* Day1: 0 normal pushups(had to do on knees), 0 normal pullups(couldn't do a negative either), 15 lb curl for 12 reps
* Day 27: 20 High/low pushups(from core synergistics), 25 negative pullups, 25lb curl for 20 reps
* day 56: 30 pushups, 5 REAL PULLUPS!!!!, 25lb curl for 20 reps 









 hmm...honestly it felt like most the weekend. But some times i feel the same way about tastosis or Day9. I think if i had to verbalize it i would say this felt like you casting for Playhem(which i'll mention is awesome).  i just expect a slightly more serious cast out of MLG than i would out of Playhem.  Once again, Just my personal opinion on that one. I really feel the next step for you is getting comfortable in front of that camera so that when you come on stage at a big MLG, you'll fit in.

ALSO, you'd better watch out for Tumba's fiance talking about him like that.  




 Hey robin,

I thought over all you did really well especially when compared to Beta stream last year. If i could give some advice it would be

* i didn't mind the camera work but it did seem off and/or too frequent. When you do a zoom/rotation there needs to be meaning behind it(aka getting a better view of the action)
* you need to find a line in between joking caster robin and serious caster robin. I thought when you casted Korean qualifiers with JP you had it spot on...this weekend you seemed a little too "jokey"  but thats just my opinion
* you need to become less aware of the camera when you have a cocaster. During the finals when Tumba asked you a question you would speak to the camera with an occasional glimpse to him...it really should be the other way 




 i'm in america and getting crazy amount of lag at 240p 




 I would suggest trying to get some more protein from natural sources instead of bars/shakes personally but it seems okay...honestly using a site like loseit.com to track the calories your intaking  and the  macros 
would be best 




 also wanted to add that I did this by keeping 10ish almonds on my desk for when i get hungry.. 




 Hey I'm also on week 7(yesterday being my yoga day) and I added around 200 calories to my diet and it made me feel a ton better. You know what? it may diminish my results but I don't care because this is about making a change I can live with for the rest of my life..if my results are a little slower but I feel better than I think its worth the trade off :) 




 Speaking from experience, you can't just go in with the mind set of looking better would be nice...you need to go in with the mind set that "90 days from now you ARE going to be in such chiseled shape that your body will be like a gods". I love to cook...guess what i did? I took the principles of the p90x diet(50% protein, 25% carbs, 25% fat) and logged my meals in loseit.com and I cooked meals i thought i would like that still fit into that plan(Last night i made a delicious honey glazed salmon). 




 i'm a gold level terran(and i'd like to think my zerg is silver level) and i'd be willing to help.

test_subject4671.465 I'm normally on after 7pm EST 




 when i get a case of the blahs i try to substitute one of my workouts for another less formal workout...this usually looks like me replacing kenpo by going to the gym and playing basketball. changes up the routine a little which i'm all for 




 I had been struggling to hit 1900 calories and even though p90x suggested 2400 i thought i was doing well. I uped m caloric intake by 200 for a week and saw weight loss....so i would try adding a couple hundred calories for a week and see what happens...at the worst you gain a(single) lb and find out that its not the issue. 




 I'm going to a concert tonight...hopefully my plyo jumping will come into full affect tonight. Really starting to kill pullups and this make me happy. 




 I have the Gold's gym 25. They work really well when dropping weight but can be a little tedious if you are going up a weight...they work for what i need and were cheap. My only complaint is there light weight as i'm now reaching the point where i need heavier weights 




 i just don't like playing tvt there...i mean i dont like tvt in general...but any map where you can seige up on a ledge and kill me and i cant stop it i try to downvote 




 yesterday was back and biceps...i upped the weight on almost every bicep workout by at least 5 lbs. I really struggle with form here..using my back to get weights up instead of isolating my biceps. Today starts the stretch of the week i dislike the most (yoga, into legs, into cardio day) 




 week 6 Day 4 today. starting the section that really kills me..my legs are still sore from Plyo and I have yoga today, leg/back tomorrow, and then Basketball(which i replaced kenpo with)I haven't weighed myself in a couple weeks but i think i'm down 2 lbs last i checked. Significant strength gains though. 




 i downvoted antiga bc of close spawns and taldarim(doesn't suit my play style) 




 you are going to run out of space if you link to every day for the rest of the program ;)  




 this seems like carb overload...i don't know how you could meet the 50%,25%,25% with that much carbs unless you had nothing else with carbs in it the rest of the day 




 yeah when i took my post 4 week pics i actually could tell a major difference despite the consistent weight. So i'm not complaining. Week 6 now and going strong 




 i'm jealous of your core. two years ago i was killing ab ripper x every other day....this year i still haven't hit every single rep 




 i think the thing i notice most is the better posture. Yoga + strengthening in the back probably have helped a lot with that. Good Job 




 I did chest/tri/shoulders today. Must admit i really didn't feel like doing the workout. I went to the rivalry basketball game at my alma mater and we lost a heart breaker...I really wanted to eat pizza and drink beer afterwards...instead i came home, did my workout, had a cup of chocolate milk, cooked some chicken tenders, and had the tenders with a protein shake(I WAS REALLY low on calories today) 




 I don't know if you saw my results when i posted them last week but that is exactly what i've been doing using the program(lose belly, gain muscle). I personally eat a 1900(plus or minus 200) calorie diet using the 50% protein, 25% carb, 25% fat principles of the fat shredder. I use loseit.com to track my nutrients 




 you must not play either of those two races bc if you did you would know that the statement you made above is just not true. Zerg has to constantly set up flanks to creat good engagements and still lose half the time. Stutterstep is anything but bronze level friendly especially when you need to macro at the same time. 




 Good because we need protoss to be more of a HERP DERP 1-A race...must remember the new snipe will now effect TvP late game which was already craptastical 




 I believe D is used for wide grip. E F are probably just used for casual pull ups? idk about those two 




 there is a lot of angst against people who are already in decent shape so thats probably why the downvotes on the main reddit. Good job on starting, keep it up! Also don't be afraid to go to your knees to get more reps 
























 the thing is...you have the same amount of units at that mark as you normally would so it doesn't effect your ability to hold it. 




 as so0n as you scout it start getting towards vikings. Multiple bunkers(mostly just to delay the push), pull all the scv's when you finally do attack 




 What is the thought of 1 rax double expo against protoss? I tried the build today and it seemed like my midgame push was much stronger(but slightly delayed). It keeps you ahead of a fast expanding protoss on economy and you don't sacrifice much in terms of army production because the increase in scv's gets your back up to production levels of income quicker. Discuss. 




 GSTL has players planning in the same way Code S does...Same with Code A.  




 my point was that you were choosing your data to fit your point. You can't said oh Code S is decent win % and ignore Code A, Foreign tournis, and GSTL.  




 i'm talking about dropping around max. Of course you can try to drop before then but most decent zergs(plat or better) should be able to shut those down with minimum losses. The theory is that since brood lord army is so slow you should drop to exploit that...except that's putting at least 12 army supply away from your main force in what is already a hard straight up fight. sure maybe that one drop might kill some drones but it hardly matters if the rest of your army dies. 




 if you drop you die because those units aren't present in the big fight. 




 not including the (1-26) winrate in the GSTL 




 here is the link i promised http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=266096# 




 I believe there is a blog post by blizzard that says if you get to x number of points in a season you gaurentee yourself a promotion. 




 i can't answer all your questions but i can answer a few.

* By placing a sacrifice depot you do nothing, any skilled player can pick that off with roaches or will ignore it.
* I dont understand how factories floating matters...but they will probably target the wall on one point and then ignore it while trying to kill off units.
*i place my down right before i head out for attack i think.
* a bunker and some depots..just like your natural. Don't use baracks bc then you have to interrupt production to lift.(also you really should make sure you get those 50 scv's!)
* I almost never win vs z with my initial push, rather it sets me up to kill them eventually/get into the late game ahead.
* It depends on what X is and what their composition is an whether you want to rush medivacs/tanks
* I do this! I have a +1/+1 stim medi timing that i hit against z...usually combat shields finishes up during the attack or slightly after i think. I'll link a replay here when i get home. You can really explore the 1 rax FE. Fast tanks/slow tanks/no tanks/1 rax to mech. Each is situational though...If you are comfortable with one,stick to it.
* 50 probes by 10 minutes(and 100 overall supply iirc)
* if someone is going mass muta just go kill them. Mutas suck in head to head...or build a thor or 2....turrets are really only there to delay them. 




 as a terran...you hit the E button and then click..then approximately 2 seconds later is when the emp actually hits. At least thats been my experience. 




 just so you know, emp is not instant...it takes a while to cast 




 thanks 




 i know how to do the maxes...more in regards to the supplemental exercises 




 i know how to do the maxes...more in regards to the supplemental exercises 




 the program isn't very outlined from what i've seen. Just giving the exercises to do but nothing outline progression(whereas SS is really specific with its progression) 




 I did my first day of Westside yesterday but I'm not sure how to progress on my upper body max day. Do i increase all my weights? 









 how did you determine your starting weights while doing west side? 




 okay, watching your replay i noticed you are basically doing a 1 base all in...is there any reason why? 

first note is you actually see his overlord scout in your vision but you still send your scv scout the wrong way. If that scv scout goes straight to his base you see the lack of drones and you can bunker up.

Here is what your base looks like when the baneling bust hits. Up to this point you've done no scouting. http://i.imgur.com/SoeYD.jpg

Here is what my base looks like(notice i've taken an expansion and still have almost the exact same supply amount as you) http://i.imgur.com/nYdyk.jpg

tl:dr-if you scout it they can't win 




 select is the game reported before and is from 2010..should be on the mlg site somewhere hopefully. 




 I remember when i was in silver/gold league i thought banelings were the most overpowered unit in the game and i seriously thought "herp derp make banelings". But then i learned to split my marines and how to target with tanks and now i trade with banelings well. Currently TvZ is my strongest matchup as i fell terran is really good at abusing zerg at all times in the game. My worst match up by far is TvT and that can't be based on OP/UP. 

I think Protoss is the easiest race most definitely and the strongest race and I think they could use a late game nerf. But if they get nerfed late game then they can't compete with Zerg. I've just come to accept that I have to play better than other races if I want to be better than them.

 So i'm thinking about starting Westside for Skinny Bastards and I'm looking at starting with the following schedule for day1

* bench press: max set of 3-5 reps.
* dumbbell bench press: 3 sets of 6-10 reps.
* Chest supported rows: 4 sets of 10-15 reps.
* rear delt machine: 3 sets of 12-15 reps.
* Hanging leg raises: 3 sets of 8-15 reps.

my questions is how do i determine a good weight for the non max exercises. I know i can do the SS method for the bench press(add 10 lbs until i slow down but what about the other ones. Same method?
 




 actually thats part of the beauty of this build, any 2 base all is extremely weakened bc of taking out sentries or even just the zealots. Scary counters are 1 base colossi and 2 base colossi is harder as it forces late game. 




 This is not an all in build...in fact its a really strong build that techs really well. I personally prefer the 4 rax variation of this but the idea is that you(as terran) want to trade minerals for gas. The early marine pressure is simply about sniping as many sentries/stalkers as possibl to delay tech or weaken it(as it wont have enough supporting units. Taking 4(or even 3) gas afterwards you can still tech appropriately without delaying tech.

EDIT: the build for the 4 rax variation is  10 depot,12rax,15 cc, 15 2nd depot, 18 2nd Command, 25-3(rax),supply depot so i would assume 6 is similar 




 thats the point...once i scout them i'm not sure how to react 




 but scv's don't really help against banelings :-/ 




 What is the best way to defend an all in assuming you've already 1 -raxed expanded. I've been hitting a lot of four gates/3 gate proxy robos/baneling busts/roach baneling bust and have correctly identified all of them coming. Some I hold, some i don't. However, I don't ever feel in control of the situation. I just kinda pray they mess up somehow or back off a little bit. How do you hold these builds?

I "know" the answer is bunkers but i'm not sure of the amount to make and also whether to prioritize them over say a supply depot so i don't get supply blocked. 




 all weekend the streams in the live player were freezing/stopping. I tried talking to support and they either told me i was lying or told me to switch browsers and would not help further. I was really pissed as a paying customer. When i went to twitch.tv I had no problems except not being able to watch high quality...but that was better than everything stopping middle game 




 its b een doing all weekend and when i contacted support they told me i was lying .
 




 He sounds totally different...a lot like he did back in the day 




 i go 4 rax into 3 gas..i think its puma's build. gets tech up at a decent rate and allows quick 3rd 




 If you play terran and are diamond level or below this timing attack should be pretty powerful. I can't speak for higher than diamond as i haven't matched up against any masters zergs yet. There is a couple of variations of the build in this replay but this is my standard one. Note that i had horrible macro but it didn't matter.

http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=263476

here is another replay where i dont commit to that push as much because i scout early units.

http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=263488


I'm also working on a 1 rax expand variation of this build that skips the helions that i'll post here soon

EDIT: the basic idea is map control is gained via aggression

 I recently posted my TvZ push that I've been doing to good success here and may post my TvP once i've gotten the late game transition ironed out. My basic build right now is 1 rax expand into 4 rax with a midgame pressures that build up advantages. 




 as a fellow platinum terran
TvT-i think thats just how the match up plays as I run into the same issue. I've been experimenting with bio and it seems to do well at times.
TvZ-you should be killing them before broodlords....or you should be so far a head that you can just produce vikings and marines and kill them.
TvP- Dont get to the late game...ever. 




 oh snap....now i can afford to off race! 




 would a nicer less gas heavy move be just to start into a ffe? cannons murder marines...don't really know as i'm terran though 




 here is my NA contact info: test_subject4671.465 friend me and i will do a couple of practice games with you so you can get a feel for where you might need static defense and/or marines 




 and they didn't even produce lag free to US. 'm in VA and was lagging  incredibly all thoughout last day 




 no...i posted a thread about this before the event and it got downvoted to hell...only half the games were commentated 




 sounds like a good variant of it. This is just a general guide line. other times i'll  go faster tanks or i'll create a reactor for the starport ^.^

 no. I should have taken a 3rd and 4th gas guyser with my 3rd command center instead of going for a 3rd and 4th cc.  delayed 2/2 purely macro level mistake as I have other games where i've timed it much better.

Edit: If you watch my POV you can see that i was almost solely focused on the attack and wasn't macroing well 




 1st game was a mech vs bio base race and 2nd game was build order win. so pretty decent 




 It was on POV 3. I believe score was 2-0. Goody mech so good!

http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=263476

General ideas of the push:
Reactor helion expand
add two more rax w/ reactors
add a gas, build a starport and 2 engineering bays
get 1/1 and push with first two medivacs w/ a scan available to clear creep
follow up with 3rd and tank production.


The hardest thing for me to hold off is a baneling/roach all in simply bc of lack of units so I really half to keep track of gas/units with my helions. If I scout it I'll prioritize tanks over medivacs and build a lot of bunkers. This is a powering build so once it takes off you should have a good advantage 




 I like to do a strong time push that hits before mutas
http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=263476 




 they did it for the previous arena by bringing in the playhem guys(robin, adebisi, axel, tumba) and i preferred that. 




 last arena they had 8 streams iirc-4 casted and the main screen POV. I would prefer that to the 10 stream, 2 casted and the rest POV as I prefer a casted viewing experience 




 its not a concern so much as a preference...and if enough people share my preference than MLG should take note...if not it doesn't matter...but as a consumer we should dictate the market.  




 So according to the press release by MLG, half the games will have no casters and will simply be POV of players in the game. Is anyone actually looking forward to those streams? Are you planning on watching those streams? I personally would rather see those four streams reduce to 2 commentated streams as I personally enjoy the extra casters 




 i've had two friends die from bench press failures and one become paralyzed...thanks but no thanks. 




 I would like to gain muscle...I really dont have a ton of fat to lose. 6 foot - 175 ish. I just finished p90x to get to that from 200lbs...but that program didn't seem appropriate to adding mass muscle. 




 I looked through the links/faq but I couldn't seem to find what I was looking for. I'm trying to find a good gym schedule that i could follow that would be less focused on big lifts(like squats, deadlifts, bench press). To be honest, I'm just not that comfortable in a gym, much less with that amount of weight without a spotter. Can anyone direct me to a good program. thank you :)

EDIT: Just finished p90x so i've done bodyweight exercises but am looking for something that allows for bulking easier 




 and my vuvuzela 




 its very hard to keep ravens alive in a fight 




 the belief is that you have to do early damage to even participate..I prefer a 1 rax gasless expand into 4 rax 3 gas build. If opponent 1 gate expand or nexus first i feel my 9 minute mark push and then 11 minute mark pushes will do so much damage that i win... 3 gate robo is the bane of my existence though lol. (plat terran beating diamond p's) 




 I've been doing to polt bio play with double ebay. It gets countered by mass ling infestor somewhat but if i scout that composition I'm perfectly comfortable doing non stop drops and playing for the late game. I feel the longer the game goes the better it is for terran as I can snipe bases/drones etc easier and bc terran is very cost effective 




 no i'm saying we shouldn't act shocked that they act like every other business 




 Seriously guys. Everyone is in an uproar over the KESPA/MLG thing. MLG is a business that is trying to make a profit. You know how they always say that if IPL/IEM/NASL go out of business its bad for ESPORTs? Thats a lie! only one of these can come out as the alpha dog(see ABA vs NBA, WCW vs WWE, UFC vs Strikeforce, etc) and MLG is positioning themselves to win. 




 i play terran and i dont have any of my builds mapped out above 40 supply(and thats only for protoss). I feel terran plays really reactively as well 




 isn't the other player thorzain since he won Dreamhack?
 




 thanks for the link...its weird..i can connect now . 




 In the USA, can't connect to battlenet. Any one else having the same issues? 




 core is my favorite workout...i may be a masochist though... 




 It all depends on wha t want to follow up with. I've been using the polt 3rax late tanks early double ups style(detailed in a recent day9 daily) so after my first 4 helions are on the map i'm throwing down two more rax(around the time i see roaches/banelings) i have enough time to produce 1-2 mauraders and bunkers etc. Remember that helions are primarily a scouting tool that help deny the third...keep them a live at all cost.

EDIT:i wait until i have all 3 rax up with 2 reactors and 1 tech lab before moving out or if i scout early double spine or quad queen at the front of opponents base(since that signals they are being passive) 




 i wall off with the factory/reactor bc that provides a high HP target that a zerg can waste banelings on. Plus it funnels towards one of the two depots. You shouldn't have your expand on the low ground until you have a force of 10 marines at the least(which will be well after both the roach and baneling time) but yes sac the depots. Remember these are respectively ALL INS..if he doesn't beat you there then you pretty much auto win. therefor we want to make it as hard to beat as possible. making him go up the ramp means you can line up the hellions to destroy most the banelings as they come up the ramp
EDIT: and if he has roaches keep producing those maruaders and set a couple scvs to auto repair and then lol as you win 




 as soon as you see the roaches pull back the hellions and build a marauder and a bunker at the top of your ramp..remember he is sacrificing his economy to damage NOW so you can delay your expansion easily. 




 High Plat terran here:

your first helions come out right around the time a baneling bust hits if you are doing helion expand. by this time you should have an scv that has scout his main/natural...if he has no natural bunkers(2) at the top should solve all problems(including roach rush etc). Keep the scv in his natural to make sure he doesn't take it(hide behind mineral line)

assuming you 1 rax expand in tvp(which you definitely should be doing) then you put one bunker down automatically and you should scan his main circa 6 minute mark(right when your second CC becomes an orbital)...if you scout 4 gate make another bunker and pull some scv's and set them to auto repair

what is your tvt build? If you go cloak banshees you become pretty safe to any 1/1/1 build and while you will behind economically to a 1 rax expanding terran i prefer the early tech in this matchup as you can put pressure with tanks on a 1 rax expander 




 orbital commands can not be loaded with scvs 




 i try this style but every time i do it i get over run by a cheap cheese or someone going mech. :( i think i may expand too fast? idk its not the build order i need inso much as the idea of how to play it...i feel at a lost. 




 So I'm a current [plat terran](http://sc2ranks.com/us/2781279/test_subject4671) and I do really well with tvp and tvz. For tvp I do the Puma 1 rax expand to 4 rax/3 gas build and for tvz I do the Polt double Ebay mass marine late tank early agression style. The problem is, with tvt i dont have a build that I feel comfortable doing.I've tried one rax expand, reaper expand, tank expand, banshee expand....i just dont feel comfortable(especially with the prevalence of two port cloaked banshee in plat league). What are some build you use? 




 i think the general consensus on this sub is the pure protein offers the best value/taste/macros 




 i uninstalled the old driver(using control pane;-remove programs lol) 




 i fell back to driver version 295.73 and that has at least been a work around to the issue for me
EDIT: apparently the current BETA driver will also solve this 
























 actually you caught it iirc 




 don't worry..they now made it so no one can watch it.... 




 6pm tonight iirc 




 haha its cool...i was planning on typing it out myself 




 HAHA way to post while game still going. 




 if you watch from the mlg site there is a pull down with says "streams". Select Starcraft Blue(or if you are a gold member select premium 1/premium2) to view other matches being broadcast. If you use twitch to view I think its twitch.tv/mlgstarcraftb. If you watch from embedded player in Team Liquid select MLG Blue instead of MLG Red. 

Basically its a second stream with premier casters/games. Yesterday it was used to broadcast WCS. Today it will probably be stream end of that tourni and/or other games from MLG brackets. 




 blue stream 




 take your first maurader and pull scv's and go win with that force? Alternatively...super early 3rd 




 there is another guy who posted asking for a ride...maybe you two could swap and trade off etc? http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/ynh64/mlg_raleigh_this_weekend/

 ahh I'll also note that the Raliegh event is usually severely under-hyped...its seems most players hate attending it. I live in VA and have friends who went last year say it was very lack luster
 




 aren't the 8 open spots just the qualifiers from open bracket like normal? Or is there an additional 8 spots? 




 not really. He aid every time he has watched supernova he has gone bio first game and mech second game vs zerg. It was an intelligent prediction 




 i believe i saw MLGAdam somewhere in this thread say its 4 streams this time as opposed to the 2 last time. 




 for *two tournaments. Remember WCS NA is at the event too 




 Notes as I go through

* 2nd depot too early...should be built by scv that is building rax(heck you could even go 2nd CC before 2nd supply depot)
* it seems to me like your two gases are really late(especially since you have 150 minerals left still after you build them)
* also you said you wanted to do early pressure with helions....so why 3 rax? that's counter-intuitive. if you place 2x refinery down after expansion you can go into reactor expand pretty quickly.
* you built rax on high ground and then lowered them to low ground....just build them on low ground if you want to use them to wall off...better would be supply depot wall off.
* a scan around 6:30 would be really nice so you could no if he is all inning you or has taken a quick 3rd as you have 0 scouting
* good news: at 7 minute mark you are ahead on workers. bad news: its bc your opponent is not droning hard. lol
* ALSO. 1000 minerals floating at 7 minutes!!!!! Thats so much! Thats 2 CC's or 20 marines that you could be pushing with...
* at the 10 minute mark you still have 0 scouting...what if he has mutas? also...still floating money...also you only have 45 scv's...try to hit 50 off a 1 rax expand at 10 minute mark...also you are just starting upgrades. no bueno
* at the end your opponent is floating 2k/2k....a good zerg would kill you with that.

not trying to be harsh...just saying if you can clean up these issues you will be even better :)
 




 they showed the winner...AMD 




 I posted this replay a while ago...sounds like the +1/+1 medivac push i do thats built off of polt

http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=263476 




 i think he a paragraph

EDIT OH SNAP ITS MY CAKE DAY! 




 this sounds nice in theory but i don't no about practically. In the TvT i don't think my factory had started when i saw blue flame...i rushed to starport and didn't get anything out until after his harass with banshees.

I was trying to use those first helions to pick off some lings and i definitely got caught not looking at them...i failed to raise my depot in my main which is what really cost me the game(my frustration at the end was bc i kept trying to raise it and it wouldn't raise). Doesn't building a second factory mean i'm forced into mech? I HATE playing mech.  




 So in my last 6 matches I've lost all of them to early pressures/all ins or styles of build that i saw coming and I reacted to obviously poorly. For example. I was playing a TvT...saw he had 13 gas and I was playing 1 rax fe style. I scanned again around 6 minutes and saw he was doing the blue flame helion/cloaked banshee build. I built turrets in my mineral line and bunkers for my marines. I suffered some damages from the banshees because my opponent exploited the areas i din't have covered by turrets but overall i thought i was minimal....but still my build is thorzain build which masses marines which SUCK against blue flame helion as i found out when i went for a +1/+1 medivac timing ....so whats the appropriate way to respond?

Likewise, each of my last 5 games against zerg have been roach/bane or bane/ling all ins that i scout with my scan...i put up multiple bunkers in reaction(to the reactionary race yeah right) and I still can't hold any of these. 

TLDR-I need help understanding how to react to builds i see

 i believe i saw something about a way to stand up in such a way that lowers the naseausness from doing pushups...I believe it was something like plant feet-slowly roll up while keeping chin tucked-raise head 




 So I watched this game and I believe you are asking the wrong question. A better question you should be asking yourself is why did I lose this game? Now it seems to me that the answer you have come up with is colossus..but that is not actually the point where you lost the game. I'm going to remark on a couple of things i saw that were glaring to me

* you open with 2 rax b ut never put on aggression sacrificing economy for an army you do nothing with. Please note the filtersc 1 rax expand and try it, learn it love it.

* you make your expansion in your m ain...you can actually make that at  your natural and build 1 bunker earlier to keep yourself safe. This will kick start your economy.

* at the 15 minute mark you still didn't have 50 workers. With a 1 rax expand the goal is to 50 workers by the 10 minute mark. meaning your economy was worse

* add ons...you actually can't afford to constantly produce out of the number of barax with those add ons...this led to you cutting scv's and delaying crucial tech like medivacs

this is just general comments....here is an example of me facing a protoss and my play.
note my scv count at the 10 minute mark and when i push(roughly between 10 and 11 minutes). Don't worry about the first push i did where I pulled scv's as i did that based on scouting the early nexus and is not something you should be worried about. Note my ghost academy comes down with my 3rd and my upgrades are decent ish...


Over all look at the filtersc timing guide for vs protoss..master it...win
 :D

 can you attach a specific replay? i can give you general advice but a specific game might help better analyze what YOU specifically need to do. 




 in general it looks like he built a lot of cannons and tried to mass produce colossi and in general didn't spend his money. Remember that resource score also takes into account "unspent minerals" so its not the accurate of measures...he only had 50 probes to your 70 scv's + mules..you had a better economy by far.

yes...don't focus on targeting any specific units right now(except for maybe hotkeying your vikings and using them to target colossi). i'm in high plat and i'm JUST getting to the point where i can identify when target firing is beneficial. Rely on that macro :) 




 for a large part of the beginning of the game your main is not rallied to minerals so that provided worse eco for you..just a heads up

put those units in your bunker! if he had attacked with a couple sentries/zealots(which with what you scouted to this point aka double gas) would mean death to you

he failed to use his extra minerals on gateways/zealots. bad on him

look like when you maxed you either moved commanded or targeted the colossi with you bio resulting in you getting wrecked

in the end your marco ended up winning you the game...yay! 




 hmmm i've never noticed then using own3d for an arena...which have been where i've had issues. you could be right. 




 So I tuned into the LOL arena on MLG's page and right away i notice the Own3d logo. I'm really hoping they go this route for the future SC2 tournis too as twitch's ability to provide service has been fairly lackluster to this point. 




 He forgot to attack. He let Hero build up the air attack. He should have backed up and let the infestors regain energy...oh and he also received the InControl Kiss of Death. 




 I think the general consensus is that the builds you need to know are 
all variations of the one rax expand

TvT:Thorzain Build - Covered in a Day 9 Daily
TvP:Bomber Build - Covered in a Day 9 Daily.
TvZ:3 CC helion/banshee???? I'm actually not sure on this one. I do the Polt TvZ build covered in a Day9 Daily

I'm not a huge fan of Day but he does map these builds out pretty well and they should probably be your next step. However, Don't be afraid to stick with Filters 1 rax expand and start trying to react. You should be to the point where your macro is good enough to start testing out compositions/responses 









 a replay would be preferable but honestly pure macro should win you most games in silver. Remember that vs zerg your 10 minute push is to destroy his 3rd..if he doesn't have a 3rd(and you know this by scouting/scanning) then you can take your own third and start pressuring with drops. Those upgrades seem late. My 10 minute push hits with +1/+1 




 I'm only going to comment on the TvP as I don't feel knowledgeable enough in TvT to help you there.

* 1)you placed that second supply depot way way to early. Either the scv building your rax should start it right after the rax OR that scv should build your 2nd CC when you only have one marine and after that you build your 2nd depot. not game ending but less efficient
* 2)I personnally feel like your bunker is a little late...if he marches right across the map with a stalker and zealot you're screwed.
* 3)THIS IS THE BIGGEST: IF HE DOES NOT HAVE AN EXPANSION BY THE 6:30-7Minute mark(which btw is a great time to scan) YOU HAVE TO BUNKER UP.

The build works assuming your opponent is macroing too...but now you have to start learning about what you are scouting and what it means and reacting appropriately. Hope that helps :) 




 i believe it was because every MLG we were basically taking over the front page and so everyone voted to not show top /r/starcraft  stuff 




 on the medivacs one i would suspect second gas goes up right when the starport starts...maybe slightly before. It seemed like a deviation of the polt two base marine push and i know thats the timing of the second gas in that build 




 they are clapping to the beat of the song silly
 




 Yeah I'm almost to the end of my second week. It is a very good program...although i don't know if i like it as much as p90x. I feel like i'm putting some muscle and some fat...we will see 




 league? i don't want to be offering my plat advice if you are masters bc my advice is probably worthless then. 




 Dargleins Micro Trainer. learn it, live it, love it...get dat APM 




 For me I turtle until i feel like I can control the muta flock(usually means one thor in the main and enough marines/turrets to protect each base in regards to the size of his flock-ie 7 mutas = less marines than 20 mutas). As soon as i feel safe i push out onto the map. Mutas are bad in straight up fights against upgraded marines and are used for map control, the sooner you can take that map control away the better imo. Please correct me if I'm doing this wrong master/diamond players 




 front page for this subreddit there is a place to assign flair on the left hand side near the top 




 no he isn't even in New York. said so on his twitter and in this subreddit yesterday. 




 Here are two replays of me vs zerg comp(just to show the builds). I \'m trying to decide which one is better. I currently do a late push with +1/+1 but that can mean i get shutdown by fungals. The earlier push would hit before high tier tech but be much weaker imo. Does it being earlier make up for that?

Early push: http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=267798

Later Push:http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=267799

 log in to mlg site. click the live tourniment at the top. Presto premium stream! 




 Why not hot key army to 5/6/7 since then you wont have to worry about relearning the other 4 production hotkeys? 5/6/7 are close enough to all major action buttons(T-stim, S/d-siege/unsiege, D-drop units, E-EMP) that you can hit all pretty easy. I have my army on 8/9/0 and i can do these well so i suspect you can too with groups even closer! 




 what about the monthly pass? its $20 per month and for me the price is worth it. 




 protoss don't seem to be going storm first any more in plat/low diamond. Maybe once i move up but its not something i have to concern myself with currently. 




 So right now here is my approach vs each race:


vs Protoss: I want to hit an early game timing. Needs to hit before the 11 minute mark as that's when first colossi tends to come out. I went to keep upgrades going. My Ghost academy should start when i take my third. I want the protoss to attack into me in a late game engagement so that I can maintain an arc and get EMP's. Later game Planetary Fortresses to create chokes while slowly transitioning to 3/3 BattleCruisers + ghosts w/ nukes.

vs Zerg - I want to deny the 3rd as long as possible: Including Ebay blocks. I want to have some early game harass(ie helions or marines in a bunker at the opponent 3rd). I want to feint pushes(walk to zelnaga's and back to my base) to try and force units instead of drones. I want fast upgrades(double ebay). I personally try to hit a strong +1/+1 stim medivac timing. Mass drops to allow me to build economy and start pressuring multiple locations. PREVENT 4th BASE at all costs!

vs Terran: Don't die in the early game....


As you can see I don't really have a good vs terran game plan. I don't know how to react to gas first if i'm planning on fast expand etc. How are you approaching each matchup from a high level 




 haha i'm platinum now using macro style games to improve. ^.^ Maybe i just suck at all in builds lol 




 bad english..i meant 4 medivacs total. Its the ideal composition for the terran late game deathball(or so i'm told). edited my previous statement for clarity 




 i keep seeing people say this but when i was playing 3 rax was geting stomped in silver. I think you should learn macro style as it helps you more once you get in the high leagues. 




 a)no banshees ever
b)after he shows DT's u drop several mules...need those scans
c)Lets assume we want to win off of 2 bases...maybe 3. watch your money as you attack...we need to keep it low so when we win a fight in the early game we can snowball our advantage
d)UPGRADES..GET EM EARLY AND OFTEN
e)you need 4 medivacs total and 3 vikings per a colossi....you had 10 ish medi's and 5 vkings which you suicided trying to kill A colossi
f)once you do get to let game...you have to start dropping planetaries, making ghost and let the protoss attack into you...its the best way to be cost effective

EDITED for clarity 




 it seems you have trouble marcoing while attacking. You were floating a lot of money. Also you always attacked in one place with your army allowing the protoss to fight in the death ball. You want to make him split up. Think of it as zerg. If you are at 3 and main at same time...one will be damaged. These are theories of SC2 that will help you in all matchups. I'm not going to nitpick micro cuz i'm plat too. 




 if you could pretty please link a replay? Its really hard to know how to advise you with out seeing how you currently play. It might be that you are doing a build that is countered by the current meta...or something that is small. At the plat level templar first has been pretty much phased out to heavy colossi play since templar can be abuse so easy

 how do i keep the concave while attacking? I tried to spread out but as soon as i start attacking in everything balls up. :-/


EDIT: actually even better question...what is my priority list of things to do in an engagement. I know i need to EMP, target fire Vikings, stim, and kite. What is my priority on what order i need to do those? 




 i don't...i lose even when up 11 bases to 4 









 you should look at the filtersc tutorials(located on the right hand bar). While I could critique the facts that you expand slowly, don't scout, and don't macro particularly well those don't play a big roll in bronze/silver level play. Watch the guides. Perform them and you should start winning. 
 




 i haven't down voted anyone at all. :( I'm sad someone else has

EDIT: I just went through and upvoted everyone so that everyone is back where they were before the other person downvoted. 




 the theory is..if your opponent is fast expanding, if i do an immediate CC I will not compromise my army or my infrastructure and rather that both will be immensely stronger than the normal 1 rax fe. I'll have to go through my replay tonight to see if I'm correct in thought 




 you keep the 3rd in base until its safe to move out(approx 9 minute mark)

 I would start out playing against bots. you learn mechanics of the game and how champions/items effect the game. buy one champion of each type using the IP you are earning or even play the free champs. 

Save most your IP. Just save it all now. Then buy 3 rune pages at level 20:

1.)AP RUNE PAGE
2.)AD RUNE PAGE
3.) TOP/SUPPORT Rune Page

then use whatever is left over to buy champions that you have tried out during their free championship week and enjoy. Make sure you buy/learn at least 1 jungler and 1 support REALLY well because thats what you will end up playing a lot as you start playing normals. :D

Itemization can be learned via reading guides/watching streams/figuring out for yourself 




 ALL OF IT. Just save it all now. Then buy 3 rune pages:

 for LoL I'd say Phreak and Rivington are probably your best bet. But a lot of times they will throw LoL keywords around(the same way we say baneling bust, mech comp, etc to explain complicated ideas the will say snowball the lane etc) 




 you cray cray. he said the are guest 




 please watch stephano and/or vortix vs mech and rethink your conclusion.  




 i don't even scout 4 gates any more....i just sit at my bunker and kinda laugh that he even attempted it...and then some protoss does a 3 gate blink stalker build and i bm him to the ground... i hate blink stalkers.

* 5 rax
* 6 factory
* 7 starports
* 8 upgrades/ghost academy
* 9 Army Part 2
* 0 Army Part 1 




 what are these repetition speed and repetition delay settings...cuz i don't know about them....
 




 in plat, my TvT has  been 50% win...my TvP is about 75% win, my TvZ was around 25% bc I was sticking with straight bio comps and would lose to a lot of early busts and late game became difficult to win against a good zerg. I'd said i've won all but 2 of my games against zerg since i went mech. The two i lost were based on me not protecting against counter attacks enough. 




 here are my thoughts as i watch the replay.

* no bunker at 5 minute mark...a rallied zealot and stalker could kill you straight up right now
* The protoss takes both your gas and they come late...consider throwing down a 4th rax here and then taking 3 gas puma style.
* bunker ESPECIALLY true since you are taking a fast 3rd
* scan when your second orbital finishes to make sure he has expanded...if not you need more b unkers ASAP. also good to know his tech path so you can change your comp.
* couple of supply blocks...but decent micro 46 scv's at 10 minute mark...ideal amount is 50. work on that.
* you really can't afford 3 starports
* at the 15:00 minute mark you are maxed....with 1/0 against his 1/1. and up 80 supply.
* please for the love of god at least hot key your entire army on 1 button
* the first battle happens at 18 minutes bc your opponent attacked into you with 160 supply...40 supply more than when you first maxed.
* I know artosis says when ahead get more ahead...but in the words of Day[9], "sometimes you just go f*cking kill him"
* the fight is done...you are still 30 supply up....instead of regrouping you chase him with a small section of your army...
* you still win this fight are now double his supply! woohoo!
* you do have 80 scv's....a couple too many. next time you get maxed start taking the map and choose a couple scv's and use them in your army for buffer.
* 90!!!! scvs. WAY WAY TOO MANY...a good rule of thumb is that as you take your 4th base you probably don't need to make more scv's unless a lot get killed. This might be the fact the lost you this game...over producing workers.
* 21 minutes and you are on 2/1....try to make that 3/3.
* one emp on the templar = game over.
* marauders have more sustain than marines...they can eat a couple of storms and live...need to sprinkle them into your comp late game.
 









 40 supply lead is standard in well macrod tvp...the 40 supply lead is suppose to make up for the lack of strength in out units(similar to how zerg maxes before protoss) 




 the spoiler tag is their so people can use RES to filter out spoilers. Coming to reddit and expecting not to see scores is like going to ESPN and being shocked that there are sports scores there 




 I had gone to the gym for the past week and wimped out every time. I sucked up my pride and did my 1st day

Question: I saw an excel spreadsheet the other day that mapped out warmups/progression based on first day workouts. Can some one link it here por favor? 




 this is the 2nd of the mini-30 for 30 documentaries(basically stories they think are interesting but not enough substance for the full 30 minute-90 minute ESPN treatment) that is being put out to wet appetites for the 2nd season of the full 30 for 30

 yeah..it wasn't caught on camera but he basically amoved his army into sieged up tanks with marine support. Gretorp was showing the small side skirmishes instead.  




 cool what time? 




 what time do you go and what workout regimen you doing? 




 he got 3rd at the latest IEM only losing to MVP iirc. I believe he also beat Forgg and some other credible koreans. 




 you put the spoiler tag as well as additional automatic spoilers provided by this reddit. Use RES to filter out spoilers if you don't want to see them :) 




 It depends. My 3rd is usually up before my protoss opponent so i usually work on denying it/dropping the main. If its at the point late game where he is safely on 3 bases and taking a 4th I start to go PF, ghost, Battle Cruiser with light marine support. 




 yes...last 5 minutes of the game...probably got the same commercial 6 times in a row :( 




 controlled by govt 




 I work in the Port Industry. I've got quite a big NDA but what I can say is that I report directly to the CIO of the ports in my state. 




 my 5 year is very specific and in no way, shape, or form blocks me from getting a future job. Plus my contract came with many benefits(significantly higher pay for a entry level engineer, higher levels of access/responsibility such as my reporting directly to the CIO). In the end I read the contract, processed it against other contracts i was offered(which most had a 3 yr no compete) and determined this one to be the most beneficial to me. 




 very true...my point was just that a 10 year no compete being in a contract isn't that ridiculous of an idea..whether its legal or not is a separate matter 




 i really haven't looked into it especially since my likely next employers are not in the port industry. My point is that a 10 yr no compete clause being in a contract could very well be considered normal in the business world and isn't that outrageous. Whether its legal or not i have no clear and really dont care lol 




 all it says is that i can't work in the port industry....thats not that limiting especially as software engineering can allow you to work in multiple industries. Plus I make bank 




 I'm not allowed to compete/work with in the same domain as the company I work for. So basically, I'm not allowed to work for a company that contracts out to ports(what i do now) but I can continue to be a software engineer, just in different business sector

EDIT: So to answer your question. I'm allowed to work in separate sector of the very broad software engineering industry. I think I may even be able to work in the port industry so long as I don't work for a competitor of the company I currently work for. 




 i have a 5 year no compete clause on my contract and I'm just a software engineer. I could easily see 10 yr no compete laws at higher levels. 




 you overlooked the fact that the protoss was able to have four colossi AND templars with storm. Basically, what i'm saying is your attack came too late. Also, you successfully killed the third so at this point you are ahead. There is nothing wrong with pulling back, getting to 3/3, taking some more bases and continually denying that 3rd and bleeding him dry.  




 I figure it wouldn't hurt to ask. Especially interested if you have experiences with WestSide For Skinny Bastards and/or SS. I've got some experience with the BeachBody workouts(completed p90x, did a month of Insanity and 2 months of Body Beast) so i can do accountability on that too 




 yeah but TeamLiquid is blocked by my work while reddit isn't :-/ 




 There use to be a nicely formatted thread done every code s/code a day that would give recaps of the games and let those of us at work know how everything is going..what happened to it? All i saw today was the final results... :( 




 you do understand sarcasm? 




 I wouldn't...zerg players need to stop doing the same opening...they can't expect to beat the warhound doing their old builds from heart of the swarm...they need to experiment more.....maybe they should build more BroodLords?
 




 the first time you put real aggression on was the 20ish minute mark...you did a double drop yes but it was relatively ineffective.

 You had an early +1 but you don't use it....you can probably delay it to get faster medivacs and/or more units. Having those extra units earlier is really important imo. i would scan the natural to see his army comp and whether i can attack it while simultaneously checking the third...If the third is there i attack...if its not I pull back as he should have colossi coming VERY soon. the drop was relatively ineffective...

really imo its all about delay/punishing the third of a protoss 









 i actually really like that map too

 I would like to point you towards reddit.com/r/allthingsterran :)


1. i transfer 4-6 ish, once my first command center is slightly below saturation i point both cc's towards second (or maybe even my third)

2. As I low down my 4th cc i tend to stop making scvs. I'm looking for an army of 60-75 ish supply most the time.

3. terran drops? usually a about 3 well placed turrets on corner of you bases will stop most but you can obviously play super safe with more. for zergling counter attacks i make a wall at natural and at 3rd ramps with bunkers by each(usually with 3 marines inside)

4. Thats a really broad question. go over to the allthingsterran subreddit and check out the [build guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/1c9gbb/gosubuilds_update_1_month_after_hots/) 




 Did the party ever get paid for the brightblade mission or did the screw it up too bad? 









 violet is back in korea now(notably playing in GSTL ) 




 i was trying to frame it in a way a LOL fan would understand  




 Code S is the SC2 equivalent of LCS...or more accurately its like OGNLol. ALL the best Koreans tend to play there(and Koreans tend to be the best players). Code A is the "minor leagues"..these players have an opportunity to get into code S next season.

All the new WCS action will be available on twitch.tv in free 720p but VODS might be behind a pay wall(similar to OGNLol). 




 The fear was more noticed to me in the tavern mostly. You can say that to this point most merchants have been bartering with the party but since visiting dalomar this particular merchant seemed very gruff/upset(especially for someone who raised his price by 100 gold). I may be reading into it though.  




 The first thing I noticed about dalomar when he questiones the group was that he said lower LEVELS(plural). The group only went down one level so that clues me in to them missing something. Also, dalomar seemed relatively uninterested in the book and more interested in the contents on the keep. This leads me to believe the book was a red herring used to get the party to find something else.

I've noticed that sense the party visited dalomar that towns people have been swindling them and giving them distance. Ryan thought this was respect but I view it as fear...obviously the people are afraid of the group since they started talking with dalomar.

I think everything dalomar gave them was exactly form that script(wizards don't haphazardly do anything...just ask gandolf). The arrows and rope were supposed to be used to create a path for the party not touching the floor to not spring and traps, the oil for the acid coins, the torches BC he knew they would be descending levels into darkness, etc 




 Two questions...I noticed Dalomar said lower levels(plural)..yet the party only explore one lower level. Was this on purpose if you can comment on it..
2. Was the book they retreived actually the book Dalomar was looking for..furthermore...did dalomar even want the book. it seemed from his line of questioning he was more interested in the spirit 




 I'm logged into NA and I have been stuck searching for a match indefinitely. Is anyone else experiencing this? I would contact riot support but the webpage seems to be down.... 




 no but zerg players do. ZING!
 




 i had actually checked to not continue my subscription and still got charged the $30... 




 i should note i dont represent nasa opinions blah blah blah..but making enough noise with congress does make changes(see SOPA) 




 yup 




 sequestration cuts

Source:I work at NASA 




 The correct answer is Naw-Fuck 




 i live in norfolk, va . well hampton actually but close enough 




 disappointing that wont be able to have a true midnight release party :( 









 basically you quit right as the hard part ended...the rest is all balance poses and your heart rate comes down and you can relax 




 I 3 you. FYI B1 spoils result of B2. 




 that EG Curse is strong. 




 merely fat that hadn't disappeared yet...i was 170 ish when that pic was taken and it takes me getting down to 155lb to appear lean 




 a little wider than shoulder width. Grip is the main problem but my back rounds like a mofo on my way down. doing some accesory work to try and strengthen it so i can keep my chest up. here is my [form check video](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/181kp3/form_check_squat_deadlift_bench/) from a couple weeks ago.  




 my goal is to not be weak ass. More specifically to meet the standards for the 3 main lifts. 1.5xbodyweight squat etc. i'm stalling at 115 lb press, 145 lb squat and 185 lb deadlift. done 1 reset on all and back to those numbers and still stalled. 




 actually i've been struggling with getting results from the heavy lifting thing. lol 




 these are my results from day 0 to day 90: http://imgur.com/a/6lGX5
The wasn't super strict on my diet the last two months and i skipped a lot of kenpoX days bc i was "didn't have time"

that being said i lost 25 lbs and was significantly more fit afterwards.

My one word of warning is that if you are the sort of person who has a hard time motivating yourself, you WILL struggle to do the entire program 




 it just looks wrong..both teams are making bans they just only appear on one side 




 yeah there is a glitch in custom games right now. it was happening on MLG prizefights last night too 




 they're either new balance running shoes or nike basketball shoes. don't remember which i was wearing last night T.T 




 sorry for being an idiot..fixed 




 * [bench](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bIk0aeZinA) 5 reps at 95lbs
* [squat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xji2zF0fNeQ) 5 reps at 115lbs
* [deadlift](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbHJl5pvNI) 5 reps at 135lbs

I did lighter lifts so I could really focus on my form. Any tips would be helpful. 




 i with i had people that would tell me my form sucked or if i was doing okay...I'm always unsure. 




 i hit level 30 with 0 normal wins...i always played intermediate bots until then 




 Lol fans love the DoA/Monte Cristo synergy. in LoL casts they are the opposite where Doa plays tasteless to Cristo's Artosis. 




 I'm still following my resolutions: No weight change :( but my lifts have changed:

Deadlift: 125lbs  --- 200 lbs
Squats: 85lbs -- 125lbs
Bench: 100lbs -- 120lbs
OHP: 55lbs --- 70 lbs

I'm doing beachbodies BodyBeast routine whilst adding in the SS lifts on appropriate days(i do bench before chest day etc) 




 I read this as "6 Western/Independent korean players" rather than as "6 western players and Independent Korean players" 




 if you want to kill it more do the DB Deadlifts after your high weight deadlifts. For example I did my SS style deadlift progression(45lb*5reps, 60lbs*4 reps, 95lbs * 3 reps, 135 lbs * 2 reps, 205lbs * 5 reps) followed by BB deadlift progression(25 lbs *15 reps, 40 lbs * 12 reps, 50 lbs * 8 reps, 40lbs * 8 reps) and continuing on with the rest of the BB back exercises. 




 yes. although it seems to have gone away of late for me if i stick to the lower resolutions 




 the walmart i go has 1lb ground turkey similar to this:

[ground turkey](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Fresh-85-Lean-Ground-Turkey/14089618) 




 I say skinnyfat as most people on this subreddit understand that means an ectomorph somatotype generally characterized by a pear body shape  with most my fat on my stomach. I'm very aware that classifies as overweight (hence why i'm working out ) :D

I will try morning time weighing and see if that changes things. 




 Every day before doing the BB routine, I do a SS style lift. Max Chest press, max squats, max deadlift, max OHP, max shrugs. I then do the BB routine as accessory work 




 mostly eyeballing while using loseit.com to track. for example. i'll cook a lb of ground turkey in a pan and then use half the pan and say thats 8oz  




 i went down to 188 and then recently popped back up to 190. I'm always weighing myself at 7:15pm before i eat dinner 




 I've definitely raised numbers on all my lifts(ex started at 125 for deadlift, cranked out 160 last night).
friday is my cardio/core day(specifically HIIT) 




 I'm a 5'11" , 190lb skinny-fat male. For the past month, I've been practicing my fork put downs(1800 cals, 50% p, 30% c, 20% f). as well as working out 5 days a week.

  M-max chest 3x5, chest accesory work, tricep work
  T-Max squat 3x5, more squats...even more squats. calf raises
  W-max deadlift 1x5, dumbbell deadlifts, rows, bicep curls
  R-Max OHP 3x5, shoulder press, lateral raise, upright rows, Max shrugs
  F-HIIT/core

Two questions:
1. Why is my weight not changing? Do i need to cut calories more? is my 30% carbs too much? Do i need more cals so my body doesn't hold in fat(that feels brosciency)
2. All my workouts last a little over an hour. sometimes i'm soaked with sweat(see leg day) and other times I feel a pump but don't sweat...does that mean i need to work out harder/longer on those days 




 I think it would be nice if everything submitted got auto-tagged spoiler until a moderator changed it bc a lot times spoilers are getting to the front page before being tagged. 




 Doesn't SK gaming have a major presence in Poland? 




 definitely check r/p90x out. I did it last year and lost 20 lbs and toned up a bit. ANd don't listen to the naysayers  you can definitely gain strength doing it if you push hard and keep trying to up your weights 




 MRN first appeared at MLG Anaheim 2012. many of us have been follwing since then. Especially since the owner is a member of the Fighting Game Community and the manager(DJWheat) is well respected by most gaming communities  




 the teams name is TowerDiveTv...hence TDT
