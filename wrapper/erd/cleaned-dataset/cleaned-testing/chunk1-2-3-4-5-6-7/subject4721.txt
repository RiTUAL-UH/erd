 Long time baker here, same advice I've given before. Find the top one or two Bakeries in your area and ask them if you can intern for free and for you to trail the guys working their shifts. Stick it out for as long as you can/they will let you. That's the only way to learn about the night life that a baker has. You work/bake at night and try to sleep during the day. A bakery is open 365 and it's almost impossible to miss even one day for ANY reason. Start going to restaurant auctions in your area, bring a note book and stay even if your not buying anything just to keep notes on the average prices of the equipment you might need. Trust me buying this way will save you thousands of dollars, for example a 30 Qt Hobart Mixer goes for a couple of grand but you might get lucky and pick up one for between 500 and a grand. You should also start going to the Food Shows and Equipment Shows that pop up around the country. I've already got my tickets to this one in March in NYC http://www.internationalrestaurantny.com/Content/16.htm. This is one of the better ones around, I've eaten better here than at the Fancy Food Shows because a guy selling a new oven is going to show off how good it works by making food for everybody! But you can see what trends are coming, what new equipment does what. Buy tickets and make the trip then check out Sullivan Street Bakery on 47 st http://www.sullivanstreetbakery.com/and Bien Cuit http://biencuit.com/   in Brooklyn and all the other great bakeries in and around NYC 




 I hate you! I've been looking for something just like that for the last 6 months just because I want one. I'm lucky in one way that there is a GoodWill just two blocks away but it sucks in another that it is the last one in the area, down from 5 to this last one. Now they have large bins out front and hardly anything gets put on the shelf's anymore, just picked up to go to the larger stores in other neighborhoods.  




 Here's the link http://vedere.com/accessories/fire-escape-shelf?m=HardPin cid=2014 hscpid=1722369 medium=HardPin source=Pinterest campaign=type10 ref=hardpin_type10 but at that price I think it might make a better DIY project. Still kinda cool though.

 Check this place out http://www.thebodyholiday.com/, it's where we went and they just had a renovation. Can't say enough good things about it. 




 Had a winter wedding in NYC, regrouped at the hotel for an hour then had to arrive five hours early for a flight to St Lucia (security and possible snow storm) got to our place, checked in and made the late dinner then crashed in our beautiful ocean view room. I woke up at two in the morning with severe cramps thinking I maybe got food poisoning from the local fish until around 3am I realized I was having kidney stones. I called the front desk for a doctor or an ambulance and was told the Island clinic was closed but if I wanted an English Hospital I would have to take a boat to the Big Island a few hours away and thought fuck that. So there I was in our beautiful marble tiled bathroom jumping up and down trying to make the stones pass on their own. I had some before and was told to do this by my doc if it happened again. After an hour of jumping I finally felt them and slowly worked them out of me over the tub because by now I was like a sprinkler and with a plink, plink plink sound I passed THREE kidney stones by myself in the bathroom. The next morning my wife thought I was pleasuring myself but before my bride went out to enjoy herself my body was having a reaction, I was freezing and my teeth were chattering but there was nothing but a sheet on the bed so my wife covered me with the sheet, my robe and towels from the bathroom. Thank God we were at a resort that two body treatments a day as part of the package and I was able to add one more a day so I had either water treatments or body massages which saved me! BTW this was going on while we were there https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tpzBnbL04, also can
t say enough about this place and they just finished a million dollar renovation http://www.thebodyholiday.com/ 




 BAM! That's exactly what I was looking for but goddam is it ugly. Do you know the person who did this or is it off the net? Off the top of my head I would bring it back a few feet and just have aluminum from the top of the bus to the bottom for a much cleaner look. If your doing it this way why keep the windshield? 




 I'm trying to get as much info as I can between converting a school bus, building a Tiny House on a trailer (I've decided that if I go for that I'm going to use a goose neck trailer like this http://imgur.com/wxt6Doe) and I was just wondering if it was legal or possible to do this with a bus with the possibility of removing the front end of a bus and converting it to a goose neck style attachment for a pick up truck which I would need anyway with a tiny house unless I rent one or lease one for a cross country trip. Like this http://imgur.com/VwAG1Wq 




 Right, but having a vehicle's power package specifically designed for that should be better than stressing out one that was not designed for it. 




 I'm thinking along the lines of reliability, having a bus full of house stuff and towing a vehicle would add a lot of weight and strain to the engine, right? I've read on some of the school bus conversion blogs that the gas mileage is in the low double digits and I don't want to pay for repair after repair and in some cases adding a new power package (engine, trans rear end) would cost more than the bus itself. 




 Yea, that's along the lines that I was thinking. I've seen them with goose neck in the bed. I've seen school buses going for $3 grand with a ton of miles on the engines and I'm worried just how reliable they are. I drove for a private bus company years ago and we were using brand new Ford Cabs with extended bodies like this http://imgur.com/0gh6xLd and it was a bitch to get certain parts sometimes and we had our own mechanic and we were based in Brooklyn New York. Something like this http://imgur.com/qWldpwL 




 Has anybody seen/done something similar? 




 I have no idea how I missed it? It's gone. Thanks. 




 Are you kidding? When I saw this I immediately thought of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIjYbG7vB_I. Just think how many snowballs you could build!?! 




 Nothing. I didn't see it, I didn't karmadecay it because it's a pic of bike racks and it was early and I wish I had used a title something like yours because it's a lot better than mine. I wasn't being sarcastic.

 The first "classic" omelet is also called American style because they are most often the one served in American restaurants because most American style omelets are then stuffed and have to sit in the pan longer so they cook longer. "French" style is more the second one and is my personal favorite, you can really taste more of the egg that way but when I made them for my family one morning I had to reheat them as they really didn't like them because they were just not used to them. After I learned the difference and when it came time to make omelets in class I was ready. When it was my turn I asked the Chef instructor which style he preferred I make for him, American or French I was rewarded with a smile and nod as well as an A+ for my efforts. These little things count, the poor guy was tasting overdone eggs all morning. 




 I became friendly with some of my instructor Chefs at my culinary school, especially after they learned I worked nights at an artisan Bakery so I could bring in fresh bread. We met early before class and ate the different things they would cook and I would stand there around the metal table and listen to their stories. I learned that each Chef had to do an egg omelet before they were hired. The reasoning is if you can't do an omelet then how can you be expected to teach students? The tall paper hats worn by executive Chefs have 107 folds in them signifying the ways a French Chef is supposed to know how to prepare eggs so yes, it is very important! Practice, practice and practice!!!!!

 That's really great and all but their just gonna put this on a shelf until it pops up to be installed into a poor bastards of a customers house. Just do it to one of their trucks. My favorite Fuck You go to, unscrew the air nozzle cap to their tires and insert a toothpick to keep the valve down and slowly let the air out of the tires. It's non violent, can be fixed easily and is annoying as hell! Just remember to do it towards the end of the day so no customers get screwed for long wait times. 




 What do you want them to do? Build a forty story hut? Just what is African architecture? From what I understand the whole country would be better off with highways, roads and rail lines than anything else. 




 I know, I know. Trust me I was in the food industry for over 20 years but now whenever I see a place that sells these this pic is going to pop up in my head.

 While it's kinda cool it really doesn't have a lot of room for books so I think this belongs here.

 I had a chef tell me to let it rest over some eggs, preferably the best brown eggs you could get so the Truffle will impart some flavor through the shell so you can have truffled eggs without using the truffle itself. If you can't smell a woodsy aroma immediately then you may have gotten an old truffle. If you have any left then bring it back and try to talk to someone who knows what they are doing in the store. Good luck.

 Merry Christmas https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fyS5CLBgyM  




 I said to be a nice guy first but sometimes you just have to bend to the situation and become a total ass. It is a fucked up situation and in this day and age where electronics are disposable they think just spend a another few hundred bucks on a new one and everybody's happy. The squeaky wheel gets the grease I'm sad to say. Merry Christmas BTW! 




 Had a power problem on a 6 year old Toshiba laptop that I bought at Best Buy. Since I had a problem I took it to the geek squad to see if they could help. They took it and two weeks later was told I needed a new motherboard which would cost $900 bucks. I said no and took my laptop home. That day I received a mailer about a computer place called Micro Center opening up in Brooklyn only 10 minutes away so I took a shot and brought my laptop there. After signing in the teck took all of 5 minutes to figure out it was part of the power cord (which I had just replaced a month earlier) that connects from the plug into the power converter. He stood there holding the cord long enough to power the battery in the laptop enough to turn on and make sure that was the problem. They had one in stock for $9 bucks on sale for $6 so Micro Center saved me $ 804 dollars.   
My advice, follow some of the good posts here and try to be a nice guy about it, at first. If you still have no satisfaction just stand outside the Best Buy with your laptop and a sign stating your problem, what happened and what Best Buy did or more importantly what they didn't do to help you. Bring friends and just be a pain in the ass until you get some satisfaction. Shit, if your in Brooklyn buy me lunch and I'll do it just for fun. And a lunch. 




 But but that would be an accurate title and we can't have that!

 Mr Rock, the wife and I were at a comedy show in NYC a while back when you popped up on stage with a Legal pad with jokes written on it. You kept saying lower your expectations to the crown applauding and cheering you but as soon as you saw that a girl nearby was holding up her phone you left the stage and then the building after being on stage for no more than two minutes. I can understand why you would not want new untested material going out over the net before you have a chance to hone it and just make sure it's just funny, but why not have a simple statement given by the mc stating that pictures are ok but only after the set?  




 Wow. I just found the pic, I didn't do anything to it but I guess that really makes a big difference. Thanks

 Is it just me or is their Bitch banner only allows you to see half the page? 




 Yes, I think he's just really frustrated about losing his place after 14 years. It must be incredibly hard. 




 How many pretty living or bedrooms can you look at over and over? Like a lot of rediters who comment I think I would like one or two things about a posted room but would hate the others. Everyone's got an imaginary house they want to live in that's constantly being changed by what they see here. I know mine has. 




 I noticed those bottom steps are like half the size of normal steps which makes me think it's right there in front of you as you cook on the stove. I think it would still bother me but another redditer posted the whole place, it's in Greece. Nice but just not for me. 




 Trust me, the first thing to go in a place like this is the quality of the food and the ingredients to make it. They buy cheap and hold for as long as they can which is why I can't stand having a big menu in a small place because once people think the food is sub par while they might buy a coffee or tea they will get anything else somewhere else. 




 I think the guy hoped that it would add to the customers enjoyment and hopefully add a pleasant experience to their time there but I'm sure towards the end he was watching every person just sit there with one coffee or tea mentally timing them and I'm sure it just drove him nuts. You could just feel the frustration even from that small article, even though raising rents, costs and everything else helped to close him down and he's frustrated and angry. The food industry is crazy. 




 I found it on a art/design page but they had no info on it. 




 I heard a story that when Nobu first opened there was a small waterfall along one wall and when the restaurant hit one of the partners wanted to remove it and replace it with two tables. The Chef argued that it was pleasing to look at and he always wanted one in his place, the partner then told  him each table would average about a hundred thousand dollars a year. You have to look at everything from the owners/bosses point of view. Everything costs money. 




 Hey someguyfromcanada, I haven't heard from you in a while so I must be getting better at posting. I don't think I'm gonna repost this pic. Other redditers have pointed out the photographer like I hoped but the image is not a straight photograph, it was digitally mixed of a few pics by the photographer. Is that OK on /r/Earthporn? If so I may repost but if not I won't. Have a great day and Happy Redditing! 




 It's all Starbucks fault for things like this. There's one in Union Square, NYC that have a bunch of people come in early, take a table and chairs and actually schedule business meetings all day long, only using their Starbucks reward card to order something when they have to. I was helping a guy open a small Cafe in Brooklyn that was near a college and he had to seriously think about adding free wifi because he didn't want the cafe overrun with broke college students who thought buying a bottle of water entitled them to hours of free wifi and a comfy chair. I'm sure the manager knew how bad financially they were in when she went off on the woman who thought it was perfectly ok to ask for a spoon to eat her yogurt she bought somewhere else and sit and take up space.  




 If anyone knows who the photographer is please tell us, thanks. 




 I was working a prom as a bus driver some years ago and over heard a kid brag that he had to wreck 2 new Ford Mustangs to get the BMW he wanted in the first place. He even had the pictures of the wrecks to prove it plus the spoiled little fuck broke a mirror off my bus because he was so "wasted" on the beer they were drinking. The boss billed them triple for the mirror and they didn't blink an eye. It must be nice to be rich. Plus if she did this at 15 it's a little to late to start giving her life lessons now. I guess the nannies didn't do a good job of raising her. 




 No I'm just somebody who just has a basic knowledge of computers and can't see a good reason to download tons of movies or music using what sounds like a lot of work and trouble from a site that seemed to have a ton of problems a lot of the time. Between Amazon Prime, I Tunes and a couple of other websites I pretty much have everything I need covered. 




 Thanks that was very informative. I kind of heard something for a while now but wasn't exactly sure what was going on. Does this mean the creators can launch another one using more up to date technology? Go to some little island country and redo everything again?

 I was working as an EMT for a private company based out of NJ but I was working the NY side. My partner and I had just finished for the day when we realized one of our patients had left her wallet in the back of the ambulance. When we looked it belonged to a woman who lived in the Marcy Projects in Brooklyn. She was on dialysis 3 times a week and that week the elevator was broken so we had to do a 18 flight carry down, bring her for treatment and then bring her back for an 18 flight carry up back to her apt. Thank god we only had to 3 times. Since I lived in Brooklyn I called her and said I would drop it off and asked if her son could meet me downstairs by the street. After I gave him the wallet I was doing some paperwork when I heard little pops, then my side window and windshield explodes all over me, I put the ambulance in gear, throw the full lights and sirens switches and peel out of there like I was doing a quarter mile and didn't stop until I was able to check myself out. The Police laughed and said I was just to tempting a target sitting there for just a few minutes to long. Nobody was caught but I never did that job again. 




 I originally posted this to /r/RealGirls and was asked by a redditer to repost to /r/WeddingsGoneWild a subreddit I didn't know even existed until then. I Karmadecayed it and nothing popped up but I've come to realize that even karmadecay is not always correct. I've been reposted before myself to the tune of 3 hours later with the same pic to the same subreddit so I can understand your frustration but if you want here goes, ATTENTION EVERYBODY IamSexyJesus POSTED THIS PIC IN THIS SUBREDDIT LAST WEEK!

 If your on the East Coast check Harrah's Hotel and Casino, they have a beautiful Buffet and they had All You Can Eat Alaskan Crab Legs when the wife and I were there during the summer but bring your own pliers, the plastic ones really did not work very well. 




 But the food some how tastes just a little bit better, am I right? 




 You pee, what do you think the robes are for? 




 It was probably a special, like the All You Can Eat Alaskan King Crab Legs at Harrah's in Atlantic City last summer. The old people were elbowing each other and calling out others trying to cut the line, they had to give out 3 at a time or there might have been a riot!

 I'm a fan of them to but I'm tired of having to pay for their monthly service year after year. I did it once, didn't go back for a while and when I did it was like I had to start all over again. Remember they print out their magazine out as a cookbook every year so if you want just get that, it's cheaper in the long run. 




 Thanks, here's an album of how it came out plus a pic of the roasted sweet potato with marshmallow side dish I was quite proud of. http://imgur.com/a/C4Lxx I had to use twine to wrap the stuffed turkey (what a time to run out of kitchen string, 3 am), it was ugly but got the job done. 




 Hey! 




 Yes and it's a demanding one too! http://imgur.com/iq9yY72? 




 Cooked a large turkey with butter and dried fresh herbs under the skin and got a Turkey Breast, deboned it and stuffed it with cornbread stuffing, Serrano ham and fresh mozzarella cheese so I really had two kinds of turkey. Carved the big turkey one whole side and served the stuffed Turkey Roll in slices. The wife asked for the Turkey Roll and happy wife happy life! I'll add a couple of pics later ok? 




 There's one in the 60's on Lexington An in NYC if anybody has a need for one. 




 Oh dude, I'm so sorry. Here let me replace it with this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlILYDLA7bM 




 Dude, I got this off the web like 3 weeks ago. Good luck. 




 I posted the recipe but as I did it without following one I took my time in writing it out so people could follow it. Please check, thank you. 




 Recipe:   
   Take remaining Turkey bits and pieces, roast in a 375 degree oven for 35 minutes, remove from oven and cut up into manageable pieces and place in slow cooker. Scrape as much browned bits (fond) from roasting pan as possible and add to slow cooker.   
   1 medium onion, peel and roughly chop onion and add to turkey   
   4 cloves garlic, peel and lightly mash garlic and add to turkey   
   2 boxes of Vegetable Stock + 1 of water, add to turkey (to cover)   
Place cover on slow cooker and cook on low for 6 hours then high for 1 hour.   
When done strain into colander, picking out removing as much turkey meat as possible, discarding bones and set aside to cool.   
For Soup:   
   3 large Carrots, peeked and cut into thick wedges   
   6 medium Potatoes, peeled and sliced into large wedges   
   1 large Onion, peeled and sliced into large wedges
   3 cloves Garlic, peeled and slightly mashed   
   Salt and Pepper to taste   
   1 1/2 tbl Dried Parsley   
   1/2 stick Butter   
   3 Tbl Olive Oil   
   In a large pot add olive oil and butter and cook on high until hot, add vegetables and let sit until they are browned, then stir, adding a little salt and pepper and dried herbs, cover and let cook for 5 minutes on low heat.  
   Remove cover, add strained Turkey stock, add more salt and pepper 
as needed and cook on medium heat for 25 to 30 minutes or until done. Add reserved turkey meat 5 minutes before you serve the soup. I added some chopped broccoli 5 minutes before I served the soup because I had some in the fridge. Enjoy :) 




 I did karmadecay it and nothing similar popped up, just went to recheck and there it is a few times from a year ago, dammit! Sorry. 




 Your absolutely right, I should have made that my first point. It's just that I've done catering and it's one of the hardest jobs in the food industry, the pressure and there is just no room for error. Good luck to you!

 If you want to really do this then find a small but up and coming caterer in your area and ask to work for them, free as an intern if you have to. It's the only sure way to see if it's really something you want to do. The bullshit you see on tv sitcoms and most food related shows only touch the surface. Trust me, you have to live it before you try it. You'll thank me either way you go, starting your own company or trying something else.

 Guys it IS labeled! I just checked again when I saw your posts and it says it's labeled nsfw.

 Sorry, I use the flavored alcohol for baking and such. Add a little to your sugar cookie recipe, it works great! 




 These are not mine but once the cookies are cooled just turn them over and ice the bottoms, it's flat and are the easiest to decorate.

 Then i guess it would be ok for the video and audio to be used against the alleged criminal? Imagine a cop walking down a street see's two guys pass something to each other, the cop stops them and finds drugs on one and money on the other and since it was on camera it goes against them? I guess then if a cop films a kid tagging a city owned building, instead of the cop maybe giving the kid a warning and taking his paint away he now feels he has to arrest the kid and with the video proof the city then goes after the kids parents for clean up costs because they are responsible for him? 




 I think Cops was only here for one episode, had a bike thief, a rat and a bat. 




 Remember mine had a tang to it from the oj and the cloves, I would lower the cloves, peel and chop the oranges, cook the same then reheat at the party and then add the booze. How about Cinnamon Vodka, Spiced Rum or the old favorite Amaretto? I think they would work great. 




 Nothing pissed me off more than somebody parking in my DRIVEWAY! I have the only house with a garage on the block, it's 5 feet from the street and they have to pass by 8 fake driveways to reach mine. Just ticketed a guy parked there all day yesterday! print a copy of your apts rules for parking spots and what would happen if she parked there again and just slip it under the door of the apt she's visiting or if you don't know it under her wiper on her windshield. If she parks there again after you've been nice then ticket or tow her. I've had tickets given but have not towed anybody yet and in NY once a ticket is issued the tow fee is on them. 




 I like it wet http://i.imgur.com/ld3rCeM.png

 It looked like a small bar was just inserted through the rim, not like one of the large boots so the guy was able to remove the lug nuts and then the whole tire.

 Thanks for the site, but that's not where I found the pic. I was guessing from the pic itself what the ingredients were because I hate posts of food pics with nothing even basically trying to describe it. 




 (1) Peas, Mint Parm Cheese with Honey   
(2) Sliced Plums, Lemon Zest and Ricotta Cheese   
(3) Fig, Parma Ham and Brie   
(4) Avocado, Salt and Hot Pepper Flakes 
(5) Sliced Asparagus with Ricotta Cheese, Salt and Pepper   
(6) Grilled Peaches with Ricotta Cheese and Tarragon   
(7) Sliced Tomato over Pesto with Parmesan Cheese   
(8) Sliced Cucumbers with Grilled Corn over Ricotta Cheese   
(9) Sardine with Dill and Hard Boiled Egg over Ricotta Cheese   
(10) Granny Smith Apples with Chopped Hazelnuts and Honey over Ricotta Cheese. I think.

 Tip of the ice berg my friend, Via Con Dios. 




 Last year we celebrated at the sister in laws house and I made a Hot Pot for the first time and it came out great. Something like this http://imgur.com/g4JTFP8 but we used a large wok and cooked almost everything in it, each in it's own little area. It was delicious and I'm hoping to do it again this year. 




 All you need is a matching leopard print bra and panty and your all set! 




 Enjoying it by sharing through a visual experience, one that we all as humans share, the celebration of food. Finish it and you'll see whole communities come together for a few days as everybody, young and old alike come together and share a common tradition and love of food that dates back centuries. 




 Not my pic but take a look at the French Laundry Cookbook, I believe there's a sauce/dish recipe that takes 14 things to before you even plate anything. Having things organized like that in the food world is called Mise En Place and it makes it incredibly easy to cook things correctly. 




 Make sour kraut or Kimchi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqY22Y7hVgE 




 Last year we specifically did not go to the wife's favorite restaurant because money was really tight so we went instead to one of our usual steady standby places after checking the dinner menu online. Made reservations, showed up on time and still had to wait for a table but ok. Got our menu and found they had changed their dinner menu to a chef's Prix Fix dinner menu for $75 each and up. Shit! We talked about leaving, but we were there already, it was getting late so we decided to stay but with drinks we were going to be out at least three hundred and we got fucked over the table by the fire place by the cunt of a hostess (she admitted to giving it to regulars over our reserved spot) I can make the same kind of dinner for a lot less. I'm going shopping tomorrow and I'll see what's out there, steak, pork or lobster. What are your plans?

 Yea but he was THE MAN when it came to calling out the republicans or most everybody on their shit. I just read that some think he'll replace Brian Williams as the News guy? 




 The wife and I love restaurant week. We're short on cash so every penny helps. Think of using it this way, don't go to a place you've been to before, try some place new that you would not ordinarily go to. This way you get to see the place, feel the vibe and try the food and if you hate it your not left with a feeling "wow, THAT was a total waste of time and money!"   
You can also see if your treated any better or worse because your having the "value" meal. Over the years we found the service, the food and the ambiance of a number of so called high class places so bad that we were so glad we didn't go and pay hundreds of dollars at the regular time. The waiter actually huffed at us when we asked for the restaurant week menu at Smith and Wollensky and when he slapped the menu on the table hard enough to knock over the glasses I got really pissed. Over all it's been a good experience and it's really made for people like us who other wise would not eat out in a big restaurant more than a few times a year.  




 Elvis or Andy Kaufman, neither which are dead. Either one would break the internet let alone reddit! 




 No, it came in a small plastic box as part of the promotion gift. It's brand new as well. There was a persons card and letter listing the shaker if the person wanted to buy more, it retails for 39.99 and was wrapped up inside the shaker, that's why it didn't make any noise in the thrift store.  




 Yea, I don't believe it either that's why I picked it out of all the others. 




 Sure, here you go http://imgur.com/a/Th6wp The only thing I would change is make the cut deeper so you could stuff it a little more also I forgot to take a picture of the pan finishing in a 350 oven for 5 to 10 minutes. You could also slice this and make one hell of a hero sandwich, that's what I was planning on doing with the leftover when I thought of the ramen. If you have any more questions just let me know, Good Eating!

 I used Pork flavored Ramen Noodles, carrots, baby bock choy, small amount chopped garlic, soy sauce and oyster sauce to flavor the broth. Sliced, pan fried the pork in olive oil and butter until warmed through and the cheese was crispy, then added salt and pepper. It was very nice and the fried cheese was a very nice surprise.

 Gotcha! It's just that sometimes I find those old books so unreadable sometimes. the prose, the wording, the story line itself you know? 




 Nice save. Are they worth anything? Because if not they look exactly like the type you can make a book safe with. 




 Sorry, not my pic but I'm thinking of doing this, hanging it from a heavy beam connected between two trees on my property in Upstate NY. Good luck 




 Just letting people know I checked before posting. 




 OK I see what you mean. Doing all that I guess you would need all that for the internet. 32 acres and not allowed a well? Are you gonna start a rain collection system or is that not allowed either? Love the idea of an outside shower, I want one too! I have property in Upstate New York and I'm really looking into putting something in there. Currently I'm trying to decide between a couple of shipping containers or a house on a goose neck trailer so I can hook up and travel with the wife. Do you know anybody who has traveled with their tiny house on a trailer and blogged about it? I know there's a few with converted school buses but I'm hoping someone has traveled with a tiny house on a trailer and let us know the good and the bad of doing something like that. Good luck and keep letting us know whats up. 




 Ok I checked your site and can truly appreciate all the time and effort you have put into tiny houses and from some one who is seriously interested in something like this thank you for all the info. I have a few questions if that's ok.   
If your house is on a trailer why do you need a graded road and a parking pad? Is that's because of your area? If you towed your house into your property and used jacks or whatever to solidify your home would the city know?   
Did you check for a well on your property or is that not allowed in your area. Your going solar, why not have a generator as back up and stay off the grid completely?   
Wouldn't a dish or a wi fi hot spot work just as well as a hook up through the city? Trust me on this because they are the only cable in town my brother and I get fucked every spring and summer by the huge cable bill so we keep it on for a few months a year just for that reason. 
Are you now going to have to put in a septic system? If your hooked up the the city's water are they not going to force you to install one? If you have running water are you going to use a composting toilet or have full running water then you will need a septic system, right?

 The guy was doing the neighbors wife a favor and was clearing the front of THEIR garage and some spray went that way. He was going between the car and the garage so he could only spray forward.

 Shipping containers were a perfect fit for these people https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D4WHT2F0JA. I really think you can get shipping containers for much cheaper than that. It depends where you are in relation to where the containers are. I'm seriously thinking of putting a couple of containers on some property in Upstate NY and the ones I've seen around here are around 3 grand each and another couple for shipping. Are you looking at new or used?

 From what I understand he was making regular payments and was just late a couple of times and when he went to modify it she pressed charges when he moved and he was charged with a felony and lost his job. Until that moment he thought it was something he had not done in time and the charge was automatic. He then lost his job, spent time in jail and in that period of time accrued about 15,000 dollars in debt because of non payment, late fees and court costs all while he was in jail. She just wanted more money thinking just the threat of a felony would make him give her more money but once she pushed for it it became official and he went into the system. The woman who pointed that out even told the woman she went to far and now hes a felon and she's going to get a lot less money, see she was even trying to go after his unemployment. 




 Gently hold one end and twist twice then lay flat on baking sheet. Try making it once for yourself and see how it comes out. Add spices or hot sauce if you want more of a kick. :) 




 You could start with Pillsbury dough or just buy a ball of dough from your local pizzeria.

 I have been walking by this place my entire life, I live a couple of blocks away. I would go in and get some of their cookies from time to time. When they build the Verrazanno bridge they destroyed over 1550 homes and just gutted the Norwegian community in this area. I can remember the parades they would have  and how they would get smaller and smaller over the years. Sad.

 I DID karmadecay it! Nothing showed up so I posted it. I just checked again and now it shows up in ANOTHER subreddit and NOT the one you pointed out. What's wrong with karmaecay in that it does not show all of the same pics? 




 I posted the link in comments. 




 http://www.playboy.com/galleries/playmate-reunion-1979-pics/slide-47 I was actually surprised that I knew the names of some of the girls before I read them. Anybody else remember looking for the Playboys in the stacks of monthly magazines on the way to school, they were curved and all the others were straight. 




 I thought the same way and was looking forward to his movie Drive Hard when I came across it one night. I was shocked when I realized halfway through the movie the bad guy was John Cusack! I honestly wondered just what the directer or producer had on these guys to blackmail them into this terrible movie? 




 At least it's better than Mars who lowered the amount of their candy bars by 11% and then raised their prices 




 Why do you think I posted it? For the same reason but when I browse reddit at night I keep hoping to find Australians or New Zealanders  but I haven't seen any yet.

 Is This photoshopped? If it is it's done very well! 




 I was working a prom as a private bus driver for this group of rich Westchester kids who were having their prom at a fancy golf club when this kid behind me was bragging to his friends that it only took him intentionally wrecking the two new Mustangs his parents gave him for them to give him the BMW he wanted in the first place. He was showing them the pictures of the wrecks and the BMW keys to prove it. I never wanted to bitch slap somebody so bad before in my life! 




 Just how trashy does a post have to be?  A girl holding a six pack of Pabst Blue ribbon leaning on a fence in a bad neighborhood isn't trashy enough? 




 Here you go http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/2033/ thanks to DeliriumWigger. 




 It's a glass set, right? 




 I don't think so, it looks smaller than the stair treads. 




 I see you've had to cut away part of your curtains as well. We just used a sheet of paper towels and two paper clips to cover the hole and it works great. Now our ferocious guard cat can see who's at the door! 




 Check out his videos also, the guy is a great teacher as well as Gordon Ramsey's Cookery Show https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqztXdoBHvE fantastic series available 




 Check out Jacques Pepin's La Technique and La Method. I consider them in the top 10 cookbooks everyone should have. Amazon has his updated one for only a few bucks on kindle. 




 Pics or it didn't happen. 




 I bake a lot and we just came home from shopping. I got a dozen 4 cupcake hold boxes for .60 cents each and 4 mini quick bread pans with covers for .50 cents each from the container store in NYC. All 95% off so who cares if Santa is on the boxes? :) 




 Got it from here but no price. Does anyone have more info on this? Have one?
 




 Nice looking tiny house, I just love that stove with the copper http://www.tinyhouseliving.com/andrews-tiny-house/ 




 Come on ryan I posted this already. 




 It was just either in the washer or dryer from the load before.  




 One of the first things you are taught in culinary school is the term "Mise en Place" which means Things in it's place. Check this out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place.  As you go through a recipe have everything you need out and handy already. Do not be afraid to use small cups just like you see on the tv shows, that's the reason the Chef's can make the dish's they do look so easy. As you progress cooking more and more things will come so much more easy to you. Start to build up a knife kit, you do not have to go out and spend $300 on a full knife kit. Start small and buy quality products, knifes, pans spices and ingredients. Ask for a specific item for every birthday, Christmas, anniversary and Valentines Day and you would be amazed how fast you will get what you need. Good luck. 




 I would make one for a kids party but I think that's it.

 Amelia because there's a theory that she was pregnant at the time of the flight but her and her businessman husband had so many endorsement deals that would be cancelled if she cancelled the flight, Elvis because Elvis was tired of being Elvis and Andy because he thinks it would be the funniest thing ever.  




 Just wondering? 




 That's what I said. 




 It was just a smart funny quick read. It's her story about dating in LA, her closeted gay "boyfriends", her ex who she lived together with for five years and who wrote a book calling her my fatassed girlfriend and sharing their stories without warning her and her version of their time together. It was just a funny honest look at herself and her love life and her struggle with the death of her beloved cat Emmit and having gone through a similar event with my wife's cat Noodles I could relate. I read it in a day and was just so enamored of it that when I finished it I tried the email address she had in the book to thank her for the nice few hours she had just given me and for her work on one of my favorite TV shows "My Name is Earl" and she answered back the next day! Here's a link to a story about her ex's books http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/23/fashion/chad-kultgens-uncensored-voice-takes-a-more-serious-tone.html?pagewanted=all and here is her page I found after reading the book http://hilarywinston.com/home/ All in all a very nice thrift store find indeed. Interested in a trade? 









 OK No problem but as you can see I did karmadecay it before I posted. It's not worth arguing about. It's gone and have a good day.

 Brooklyn and two guys pop out immediately...   
Neighborhood Guy 1- Elderly Black man who jogs everyday, has to be in his 70's if not older and thin as a rail, emaciated really but he's out there every spring and summer, I can walk faster than he jogs but he's out there in the street all the time. Just saw him the other day. Knew winter was officially over.  
Neighborhood Guy 2- Elderly White man, he's over 6 feet and roller skates every day using a large pole to help navigate around. He collects cans and bottles and you can see him roller skating along holding a large bag of recycles in each hand. It's a sight to see. I haven't seen him in a while, hope he's ok. 




 Place everything you want to cook in a bowl. Using a nonstick pan, add a knob of butter and a 2 tbls of a good olive oil until it's shimmering then add your hash mix in large spoon fulls, and let it cook until a nice crust forms, lower heat, cover and cook until cooked through, about 5 to 10 minutes depending on how thick the hash is. Remove from heat, place a large plate over hash, invert pan and hash should pop out onto dish. Serve in slices like a pie. I made a slow cooker pork shoulder not knowing it was St Pats day and with the left overs I just made a homemade Shepard's Pie.

 Yes, it's a porterhouse. The New York strip is the bigger cut on the right. If you look at the steak the pieces at the tip are more cooked then the pieces that are closer to the bone, that's why I like this cut for my wife and I, we can each take the pieces that we like. I didn't make this steak but the classic way is kosher salt and pepper on a hot grill over high heat for 3 to 5 minutes until a nice crust forms, flip with tongs and cook for 3 to 4 minutes or longer if you want it done more. let sit to allow the juices to redistribute and cut and serve. 









 Like everyone else, salt and pepper, dry mustard is also good or a little Old Bay Seasoning is another favorite. I also like to use the package of mixed cheese ends that you can find in most stores and deli's, they usually have a mix of american, cheddar, swiss, pepper jack and others. Make a roux, add the cubed cheeses and stir until combined, always works for me.

 Just made a basic recipe with what I had in the fridge, Made a large pot of mashed potatoes with butter, salt and milk and set aside. I then sauteed some mushrooms, carrots, onions and a left over small head of broccoli with butter. Then added half a box of beef stock and three tbls of Oyster Sauce, added the leftover meat and let that reduce for a couple of minutes then poured everything into a large baking dish, covered with the mashed potatoes, dotted with butter and baked off in a preheated 350 degree oven for about 15 minutes then finished for 10 minutes at 400, remove and let cool before serving. I really don't know why I didn't take pics during the making of the slow cooker pulled pork or the shepards pie. I made this ramen with the leftover pepperoni ham and cheese stuffed pork chops from my superbowl dinner http://imgur.com/a/8cdy8 




 Sweet! I made a shepards pie with my pulled pork leftovers the other day. I just love getting a few meals from one dinner, don't you? 




 Yea, I think you just need another egg. Biscotti can take a lot of abuse like albino-rhino said. It's a very forgiving cookie to practice on if you don't have a lot of experience. I would invest in a mixer, it would be entirely worth it. Check out your local estate sales, look at the pics and see if there are any mixers available. I check mine all the time for sales and stuff.  














 I know the Safe and the Fappenning were very popular posts but one of the ones I keep thinking about is the one where a woman redditer posts a spread sheet of the non sex and her reasons for refusing her husband sent her just before she went on a 10 day business trip. http://www.reddit.com/user/throwwwwaway29 I wonder what has happened since? 




 Which post has left you wondering, what was the story behind it and what happened after? 




 Nice pic! Thanks. Why not post to /r/nycfood and or /r/Brooklyn  




 One opened at 68 street at the corner at the Alpine Movie theater (which I can't believe is still open!) and became a doughnut shop, there was another across from the theater and is now an Arabic store. One foolishly opened up right across the street from them and is now a Halal place and one opened up between Ovington and 72street and lasted about 6 months. Gino's has the banks and all the doctors offices on 75, Originals has the subway and the kids from the High school on 67. 









 Try the squares at Elegante's and then decide. Original is ok pizza. 




 Thrifted the first William Zinsser book a while ago and just got to it. It was a nice read and was looking into getting his popular On Writing Well and was going to order a Kindle Edition for $8.50 and decided for no particular reason and found it later in the day and I'm sure it was NOT there yesterday! :) 









 I picked up Writing Places by William Zinsser because it looked interesting on a thrift store visit a few weeks ago and just got to it. It was a good read and I looked into finding his On Writing Well which seems to be very popular so I was going to order a Kindle edition for $8.50 but thought i would wait a bit for no particular reason. I went to my thrift store again even though I was there yesterday and lo and behold his book was on a shelf! It was NOT there the day before. SWEET! It's not an updated edition but still very readable. 









 If you can try Elegante Pizza on 5th Av bt 69 street and Ovington in Bay Ridge Brooklyn. This family has been making great pizza since the late 70's. The best squares in the state. Just good pizza, so good I know for a fact that they have closed down 4 pizzerias who were foolish enough to open within a block of them and they are the last to raise their prices. Nothing but good pizza.

 Your absolutely correct! With so much info on reddit, pinterest and other online sources it's almost criminal what there are doing. There are so many DIY projects and so many cheap ways to create power I have no idea where these people minds are at.

 Oswald was a patsy, he actually tried to save Kennedy by warning the FBI but was ignored. 





























 I agree, but bringing little kids into the woods with no electricity? No lights other than candles when it gets pitch black at night? The guy's got no family, friends to help him build the dam house? He HAS to do it himself? As a couple ok but to be with NO communications? What happens if one of the kids fall and hurt themselves? Wait for the father to come back and walk/carry the kid to town? Crazy. 




 Maybe they should have built the house first and of course the kids are going to be at each other, what else do they have to do?

 Some of these are the most cringe making videos I've ever seen 





























 At first I agree but seeing how Amazon has over 70 copies of this book starting at $8.50 it looks like that's how this book is going to end up also. 














 Have you tried Bien Cuit in downtown Brooklyn. http://biencuit.com/  I met the guy at an auction just before he opened and could tell he was special and I just love his bread. It's crazy good. He bakes European style with dark crusts and a great crumb. I love Sullivan Street in NYC also. I think when it comes to bread you can never have enough. 




 Thought I stole it at $2.50 but doing some basic research I found out it's not that valuable. I love Norman Rockwell and this book is full of prints and large print outs. 









 I love Norman Rockwell and I was stoked to grab this for $2.50. I thought I stole it but upon doing some basic research found out it's not that valuable but I love it anyway. It's huge (Diet Coke Can for scale), really very heavy and full of prints. The Flatbread Cookbook is really nice too. I love foccacia bread. 









 I'm not sure, I've been watching it on and off all day and some of it is interesting if you like WWII stuff. Is it strange that as I'm watching this I keep thinking how cool it would be to have a Call of Duty version of the Battle of the Bulge or be in a tank for the Battle of Kursk.

 Found out all this the hard way yesterday. Live in Brooklyn and ran over some debris on the NJ Turnpike coming home from the Microsoft Store in the Paramus Mall which put a hole in the engine. Insurance junked it and now I'm taking public transport everywhere. Decided to visit my relatives in Williamsburg only to discover I have to go through Manhattan and transfer to the J or M. Great. MTA's Trip Finder is not working (first red flag) so the wife and I map it out. Decided to take the Express bus (as we had luggage) into the city and get off at Fulton to catch the J. The express bus decides to take the streets instead of the highway (red flag #2) but finally make it into the city an hour later. Walk to the new Fulton Street Subway stop and many twists and turns and a lot of fucking stairs the J station is roped off, walk back to the A going to West 4th street and transfer there. Get on A going in the wrong direction (with help from a visably frustrated MTA worker whose job it was to help people find their way with all this construction, red flag #3) and end up back in Brooklyn so get off and decide to catch the G train. After waiting 45 minutes, now with a platform full of people we all squeeze into the train as the conductor announces this is not the only G train as there will be another one coming RIGHT behind in about 25 to 30 minutes, everyone laughs and no one gets off. Finally we head out to our guessed at stop, Flushing (having never taken the G before, red flag #4) and finally have to walk along some deserted blocks to get to my father in laws apt only 4 hours after we left and we live in the same boro! It's between $25 and $30 bucks each way by cab, car service, Uber, or Lyft and in calculating it would be as much to lease a new car for a year than go through all this bullshit week in and week out.

 A down the road neighbor had this same problem. Old man put up BLINDING lights on the side of his house that faced the neighbors bedroom at night. He kept them on 24/7 and would absolutely not turn them off for any reason. Numerous complaints to the cops came to no avail. She had her sons build a fence that in the middle by the lights is now over two stories tall. For a kicker the son put lights on the ends all pointing at every window of the old guys house and when he called the cops they used his same excuses for the lights. Never piss off a lady with sons.

 Did you know the film has spawned a controversy in the real world of baking? In the movie the baker makes Bavarian Sugar Cookies https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnKQo9n7M6Q so around that time I meet a guy who wants to hire me to run his kitchen that he's planning to open in a few months and he asks me if I can make some cookies for his daughters Sweet Sixteen party and I say sure but then he hits me with a request for Bavarian Sugar Cookies from this movie he saw with his daughter the day before the party. I research it online only to find out there IS NO Bavarian Sugar Cookie, it just sounded good to the writer. They had a bakery out in California make some sugar cookies just as a prop for the movie so there was no recipe to follow. So I ended up making large sugar cookies cut like big apples flavored with sour apple schnapps with red icing and white lettering with her name and happy 16 on them. A few months later while with the wife we sat across from Maggie and her little girl (who is cute as a button) on the subway and I asked her if she knew of the "cookie controversy" her movie has created and she said yes, some friends had told her about it and she said she's been asked for the recipe instead of an autograph a couple of times. LOL

 Here you go, just make with different flavored toppings http://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/pretzel-bites-recipe 




 Ok, if your making boxed mac and cheese with the powder mix your going to get what's on the box, a bowl of cheese flavored orange colored soft noodles. Mac and cheese is a classic simple dish that if done well can be amazing and if not done well can still be pretty good. I have a lot of deli's in my neighborhood that have small plastic boxes of the ends of different cheeses cut into squares and the usual mix is cheddar, american, swiss, pepper jack, provolone and munster. It's usually around 4 bucks so if I'm making my mac and cheese I start with one of those.   
In a pot of salted water, cook pasta (medium shells are great as they hold the sauce very well) until just al dente, drain and stop the cooking process by rinsing with cold water until the pasta is cooled and set aside.   
Butter your baking dish, set aside. 
Start with a classic Bechamel Sauce (1 stick salted butter and 2 to 3 cups flour) while stirring cook until roux is golden brown and smells nutty   
Add 1 pint of heavy cream ( or milk) slowly while whisking until incorporated   
Add piece by piece the cubes of cheeses and whisk until melted and incorporated into the sauce and stir until all the cheeses are added to the sauce.    
Remove from heat and stir the finished sauce into the cooked pasta ( this is where you can add whatever you want to the mac and cheese such as pepperoni, chopped, cooked sausage, lobster, crab whatever you want, just fold in gently) then add to buttered baking dish.    
The mac and cheese can be served and eaten as it is now but I like the melted cheese on top and the crispy sides and corners that you can only get from finishing it off in the oven.  
Sprinkle shredded cheese, breadcrumbs ( I love sliced american cheese) on top of the mac and cheese and place into a preheated 375 degree oven until the topping is crisp or cheese starts to turn brown (15 to 20 minutes)   
Remove from oven, let sit for a couple of minutes then serve. Try it this way and let me know how it comes out.
 




 Decent reading list, congrats. Now just find a comfortable spot. 




 Just because I can't order anything doesn't mean I can't look at the menu. Besides, as a professional baker who has for years been making all kinds of breads, pastry's and assorted cookies, after you go through all the work of making 300 each almost every day for years all you want is a decent hot meal at the end of the day. 
























 Sweet! 




 Thanks, it's not my description it's theirs. I didn't want to change it if for some reason the link didn't work and somebody wanted to search for it on their own. I got the wife an ice cream maker as a bday present and I'm looking for idea's gearing up for the summer. :)

 All I want for those people are to do their jobs! If I have a question I don't care if they have been asked it a thousand times before, I just want a clear answer and if they don't know then tell me that. 




 WOW! Where the hell did you find this? Sweet! 



















 I don't know how that happened, thanks. 
























 I think the important thing id that everyone has a different vision with how they want their home to be. This is a very nice shell where people can add or subtract as they want. I like the size but I envision the plumbing all on one end and most important a bed on the floor, not a loft. Either a murphy or a roll out.  




 Sweet! Real nice. thinking of making one for the inlaws.

 I haven't made these but I plan to, but I have made cookies like these before. The WW flour will create a softer cookie with a softer mouth feel than a regular flour cookie. Try halving the recipe and giving it a try. A small bag of Whole Wheat flour is not that expensive and if you don't like the cookies you can look up muffin or quick bread recipes to try.

 He likes to grill his bread with olive oil on a very hot grill pan. I personally like it a little darker. 






















































 Have you seen this video, it has a lot very interesting information on the Tiny House Movement and on American Urban Policy itself. A must watch for anybody interested in the Tiny House Movement. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-zESacteu4 









 Another view https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udQvxmq7AhQ 




 Don't forget "Murder by Death" watch "I gotta go to the can again and I don't want to miss nothing!" at 2:50 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szG35uyiiuk 




 That's the kitchen, and that's the kitchen table where they eat as evidenced by the chairs alongside. The table is steel because they also use it as a base to climb the ladder to get upstairs.

 I want to see the pic when one of these stunts go horribly wrong. Then the family can sue because he was able to get up there somehow. 




 Just keep the table clean for when you use the ladder to up and down. 









 (1) How the hell did I miss that the other day and (2) WhyTF didn't karmadecay catch that! 




 I didn't crop or change the pic in anyway. I just checked karmadecay with the pic as I found it. I checked other pics and they came up already posted. Odd. Maybe because of the nsfw tag? It's been well over 3 months so I might have posted it anyway because it's a cool pic. I can only go by what it says, right? 




 i found it on redass, thought it looked cool. Your probably right. 




 I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5059739 and I have to say they really compliment each other. 









 Man did he quickly disappear when those child abuse rumors popped up. 









 I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5059586 and again got some nice nsfw pics on karmadecay 




 Was on Lexington Av NYC waiting to turn on 59th Street, in front of Bloomingdale's, when a man wearing all white, White Hat, white suit, white shoes wearing a full length White Sable Fur Coat carrying a large Bloomingdale's bag erupts from the store's entrance and runs full speed headlong into oncoming traffic, dodging moving cars and quickly disappears into the 59 street subway station. Out pops two security guards a minute later but the guy is gone. I've wondered since then what the story was behind that mad dash. 




 I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5059451 and some nsfw pics popped up on karmadecay for this this pic.
