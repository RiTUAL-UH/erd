 I would think the opposite as soft boiled are generally 'softer', also main concern was the egg white not being strong enough and just breaking when you press.  




 No offense but I'm sure the people who are working on this are a tad bit more knowledgeable than you.  Yeah, obviously there are hurtles, if there weren't any it would be imminent and not 10 years down the road (projected). You people always pop up, "well... established knowledge dictates that this is impossible, therefore any advancement is not possible." Or maybe you're not one of those.  




 So you don't know? 




 Stupid tax. I can understand an old trusting grandma falling for this but like, how do you get suckered into buying something from some random person who pulled up next to you and who wont let you even view the product? I'm a pretty trusting person but errp

 I really don't enjoy riding a bike in Houston. It's fine in neighborhoods and less busy side streets but I just feel extremely vulnerable on a bike with cars (driven by Houstonians) approaching from my blind spot (see: I don't have eyes in the back of my head). I walk anywhere 2 miles or less (walking is under valued in today's society) and taxi anything between 2 and 5 miles, which covers most of my territory.  




 Do those bigger buses have wifi? That's one thing I wish the normal buses had. Netflix just eats at my data cap too quick when I'm not on wifi.  




 I fucking love the light rail. Instead of driving to work, I started commuting via bus and rail. Takes a bit longer (30 mins in morning up from 15-20, 45 in the afternoon up from 30) but god damn are my stress levels way way down. I don't call grandma a cunt for driving too slow or get stressed out when I miss a light. It seriously has improved my life in many ways. I'd recommend it for anyone who can, and hope that with the current surge of centralized population growth, the demand and need will be in place for valuable expansion.

Having a car is nice, not relying on a car is much nicer.  




 I can't forgive you. 




 Was talking about the first player mentioned, Reggie Bush - played for USC. It's the white and red #5 jersey on the left.
 




 I'm worried about how little ass I'll have after seeing him in 5 days.  




 I'll be seeing him at Coachella this weekend! Can't fucking wait. 
 









 People who like college sports? I dunno. 




 Maybe in college, which the jersey is from. 




 No they don't. I get them on average within 10-15 minutes on the weekends. Have never waited an hour. Montrose/Heights/Midtown area. 




 The difference between Mario Williams and Clowney, is that Mario Williams didn't have the best defensive lineman in the league taking pressure off of him in his first season. 




 It's pretty irrelevant man. They're the 16th best team in a 16 team playoff. 




 "Huge playoff push" - yeah, for the 8th seed in the East. They're one and done in the playoffs. That's pretty irrelevant. 




 Well this was an imgur album which didn't have your blog accompanying it. Just going through the pictures in the album, all you get is the burger name and the episode it's from.

 It was actually a law passed before the rise of childhood obesity in America. And it really has nothing to do with Kinder eggs, it was a law designed to ban the use of non-food stuffs inside of food products, pretty sure less to do with choking hazard and more to do with contamination.

 In my shoddy attempt at defense, I was drunk last night when I made that comment.

What my mother hears: "Spouting racist rhetoric while inviting murder"

:D 




 My mum was convinced I *would* get raped *just because I moved to NYC*. Not for going out and partying every night, but for living in a city.

While I agree that is valid for a parent to worry about their child's safety, I think it's outlandish to be convinced that you would get raped just because you moved to NYC. That's pretty outlandish, no? Just as a numbers game, the rate of rape per 100,000 people in NYC is 14, while the rate of rape per 100,000 in the US as a whole is almost twice that at 26.9. As far as cities go, NYC is one of the (if not the?) safest, at least in the US. So while it might be *less safe* than where you originate (I'm picturing the town from Hot Fuzz), it's not like you're living in Cairo or Mumbai. If that were the case, I don't think it would be quite so outlandish.

So yeah, we agree, moms worry, it's not wrong for them to worry, I just think the comment I quoted was outlandish.

People worry about a lot of outlandish things, it doesn't mean they're wrong, it just means they worry about unlikely scenarios which they have no control over.

Smells like you have an alcohol problem.

 I don't think you know what "irresponsible"

I think it's irresponsible for you to assume that someone with a fairly obvious grasp of the English language doesn't know what a basic word like irresponsible means.

 No Harden is a plus doe! 




 While I completely agree he's acting unprofessionally, he can't just "go to another team". He's under contract for 3 years - a non cap friendly contract - so it's unlikely he goes anywhere.

My guess is he's getting bad advice from his uncle again. Really really bad advice.

Stop being a baby Andre, you signed a contract, honor it. 




 Oh piss off. There has always been editorial news and 'real' news. Not advocating Fox and Friends but it's not supposed to be a 'real' news show. It's full of human interest pieces and editorialized content.

 Come off it man, I was just joking. 




 One of many things that make him so endearing.

I love that he doesn't sound like an actual black person and I can relate to him on a 'normal' level. 




 As a spider, I couldn't agree more.  




 He didn't run a third time because he ran for President of the United States, which he was also elected to twice. 




 He's under contract (not a cap friendly one either) for the next 3 years. Don't expect his situation to change.

 I don't think the connection really fits. One of his big character traits is the whole coming from nothing thus fueling his ambition for power shtick.

 Dude! Mo Williams! 




 Keep the canisters to put junk in and throw away the flimsy boxes. I fill mine with bottle caps. 




 It's actually called a string bet but yeah. 




 That would require coaching. 




 He just seemed like a genuine dude. He played with heart, tenacity and humility. He was by far my favorite player to watch outside of TMac pre-bad back.  




 The stats I saw thrown around were approximately best in the league in PNR and worst in the league in post ups. 




 I agree 100%, I just believe that his post up game has improved under Hakeem and you can see it, if anywhere, in his footwork. He is still a bit clunky at times but he definitely isn't the stone handed offensive liability that /r/nba made him out to be this summer. 




 Which is fair, but I did admit that his time in LA was an unmitigated disaster. 

Dude is busting post moves during the playoffs I didn't even know he had when he was playing for LA.

That's because he didn't have them then. He's been working very closely with Hakeem pretty much since he arrived in Houston and you can definitely see Dream's influence on Howard's post moves. Another sign of his dedication to improvement and his game. 




 "i don't see ~~color~~ flair" 




 I bought signed, game worn Carl Landry shoes a few days before he got traded. Saddest I've ever been as a rockets fan.  




 Chuck wagon! One of my favorite ex-rockets. Dude was a brick house and he had the most entertaining fts.  




 It really sucks when people hate you just because of your flair and your comments are automatically viewed through a filter that no matter how poignant or accurate they are, they're already wrong.  




 There's a huge difference between not supporting someone and actively disparaging him. After Howard signed with Houston, the vast majority of visible Laker fans spewed vitriol and disdain. "He's not big enough for the bright lights and pressure of LA", "he's washed up anyways good riddance", "he doesn't try what a fake superstar", "worse at offense than thabeet". Obviously I don't believe this represents Lakers fans as a whole but the vitriol usually trumps realism in environments like this and that vitriol rose to the top.

I don't blame you for not supporting him. His time in LA was an unmitigated disaster and then he left.

Still, reasonably discussing Howard as a player and a person was next to impossible for a few weeks/months after we acquired him.

/r/nba was sure he was done, was sure his offensive game was on par with Asik, was convinced he was lazy, sure he was a chemistry killer, etc. etc.  




 Yeah how dare I be frustrated that this sub has a persecution complex for the rockets. Seeing nothing but negative post after condemning post gets pretty old pretty fast. 

also logic? What? The average casual fan aka the majority of fans have a positive view of Lin. He's polarizing in places like sports forums because of his erratic play. Vitriol will bleed through logic every time in environments like this.  




 I think there's a difference when you're trying to imply that the Toyota Center went into a collective and orchestrated booing of Lin (which didn't happen), versus a few knuckleheads booing Lin (which could have plausibly happened).

The average casual fan in Houston likes Jeremy Lin, honestly probably more than Harden. Harden gets shit on a lot. I don't understand this perception that he escapes scrutiny while Lin is selectively and constantly dragged under the bus.

But hey, whatever can rile up the most /r/nba-heads to the side of 'not houston'.

 




 A targ bastard repopulating the others? A song of ice and fire. Crastor for AA confirmed.  




 poe's law up in here 




 There is a difference between a collection of knuckleheads booing jeremy lin and the arena booing him. In this case, I'm sure there were a few people in the stands booing Lin directly, however the majority of the boos that people are referring to were directed at a combination of Mo Williams checking in and a bad (not bad) call being replayed on the screen.

I just love how this completely unsubstantiated bullshit has leaked into every fucking thread that is related to the rockets. 




  I still can't understand how the fans accept Harden shooting 30% doing terrible defense all night and for an "All Star" and "1st team all NBA" player.

jesus christ the skewed perception this subreddit has of rockets fans is crazy. harden gets *so much hate* when he plays poorly, way more than lin. acting like rockets fans are happy with harden's performance is absurd. 

i personally think he is playing poorly but i'm not gonna execute the guy for it. he's a person. same with lin; he has played poorly much more than harden has this season yet it never changed my perception of him. he's a person, they're all young. they all have a lot of pressure on them. they don't have the best coach. etc. etc. the point is that win or lose, bad performance or good performance, i support the team and the players.

this subreddit has gotten pretty unbearable for a rockets fan who just fucking enjoys basketball for the simple fact that it's entertaining. i can't even come in here after a loss anymore; and i'm starting to realize that i shouldn't after a win either.

why does everyone have to take the fun out of sports. why can't we just leave it all on the court, accept the outcome, and talk about the game like fans instead of obsessed school girls with emotional problems? 




 it used to be an alright community. there were some solid posters who provided valuable insight. then we got yao ming and with them came what were dubbed YOF (yao only fans - basically 98% chinese people) and that kinda divided the forum and ever since then it's just a huge echo chamber of hate when bad and love when good. i go there during trade season because trade discussion is fun, but anything relating to the actual season and the actual players and the actual games is garbage.

it's kind of like how /r/nba is now. 




 not sure if serious 




 /r/nba is becoming pretty shitty. i do agree that clutch fans is a very shitty place though.

i'm starting to become extremely disillusioned by sports fans in general. they're really starting to fucking bother me. no one can just chill. no one can accept a bad performance. no one can take a step back and look at it all from a wide angle perspective. it's gross honestly.  




  It's like, if Lin makes one bad play, he's shit, yet Harden can make ten bad plays in a quarter and he's just having an off night.

it's ok man, you guys do enough hating on harden already, we're just balancing it out.

also you aren't paying attention too much because people are pretty polar extreme about harden whichever way he is playing.

i was at the first game, it was the 2nd quarter, i went to the bathroom and a guy next to me was talking to his buddy about how shit harden was.

this was the first game and the first half wasn't even over.

you just have a filtered version of reality that support a narrative you want to see. 




  that comes with love and hate.

i disagree. i don't see any reason or benefit to bringing hate into the equation. sure i'll be disappointed if we lose, and i'll be disappointed if harden doesn't play well or howard looks like he's playing lazy or lin does something stupid...but it's just basketball and that disappointment wont last longer than 5 minutes. I love the rockets but i'm never gonna turn that into anything other than joy. if they lose they lose and i go home and i go to sleep and i wake up the next day in the exact same situation as if they'd won.

C'est la vie 




 Rockets bad. Rockets fans bad. James Harden bad. Dwight Howard bad. Jermey Lin 'oh i like him he's only cool rocket'.

/r/nba is a joke. i remember it was like this for the heat a couple seasons ago, which is funny because a couple seasons ago the rockets were /r/nba's favorite second team. 




 I live a couple blocks away from there, gonna be interesting how it changes traffic. I just hope there is a coffee shop in there somewhere, otherwise that Starbucks across the street is gonna start getting stupid busy. 




 this sub is fucking retarded. any reason to hate the rockets and rockets fans. 




 Jesus this subreddit is ridiculous. They've played the exact same amount of games as the Rocket's have. And yeah Rockets fans were the only one's talking shit about Lin when he was playing bad basketball. And we are the only ones riding his dick now that he has played some decent (and tonight great) basketball.

The fucking difference two years makes, from /r/nba's most loveable team to /r/nba's villian number 1.

Bunch of fickle cunts.

 My eyes are open. I choose to enjoy the content that gives me joy, while effectively ignoring those which don't.

Nothing is worse than seeing a post that I enjoyed, wandering into the comments to actively discuss or read a discussion or just make a silly comment, and seeing it filled with nothing but 'repost', 'op is a faggot', 'this isn't oc', 'op is a karma whore', etc. etc.

1st, it takes any potential conversation out of play. 2nd, it's petty. People whine and whine and whine about karma whores and that OP is 'only in it for the karma' and OP 'is trying to deceive us', but they don't realize that half the content they are enjoying could suffer equal fates in their respective comment sections.

It's just bad manners frankly. It's rude. It takes away from other's experiences.

Granted, there are cases where OP has blatantly deceived the reddit populace, but unless it's for actual monetary gain, I honestly could give two shits.

Lied about your mom banging your dog? Cool, thanks for the story.

Lied about a celebrity you saw? Cool, thanks for the photo.

Lied about a place you've been? Cool, thanks for the window to a place I've never been or a reminder of a place I have.

Life's too short to get caught up in the whole 'i'm being (potentially) deceived by someone who has nothing to gain so I should let it get to me' game.

Gotta love this subreddit.  




 Portland also had to have a record setting game by LMA to get to OT and they had a few circus shots and a tip that could have gone either way in the first game. So you're not saying anything. Just typical basketball fan who can't digest more than the most recent game at a time.

 I believe diedrichs was bought buy Starbucks or went bankrupt and the manager bought that location and changed it to Dirks.

 Life of Joseph W. McVay as others have said but also check out Guerilla Maab 'Rise' - it's one of my favorite hip hop albums. Guerilla Maab was the 'rap group' he was in with Trae (the Truth) and their cousin Dougie D (currently serving life in prison I belive) before they both went solo. 




 OK that's what I figured you were saying. And I agree, we can't lose to Portugal, a tie wouldn't be ideal but at least we'd have the goal differential buffer for our game against Germany while they'd still have to beat Ghana (assuming Ghana loses to Germany). 




 Clarification, you're saying we will only be competing with Portugal to get out of the group stage, or we aren't going to be competing with Ghana because they're going to get out of the group stage for sure? 




 I don't really see how this is even a discussion. Unless for some reason he thinks we can compete with Germany for the 1 seed? Ideal outcome for the weekend - Germany wins vs. Ghana, US wins vs. Portugal. That gives both the US and Germany 6 points putting both teams through. If Ghana beats Germany and we beat Portugal then, like you said, there are 3 teams vying for 2 spots in the last game instead of 2 teams in (assuming US and Germany W). 




 Better to have 49 quarters than 2 quarters. 
 




 I don't really see how that would be all that beneficial. The more intersecting thoroughfares you have, the more 4-way stops and stop lights you need - this is bad.

I think the solution will be more 'science' than 'structure'. Mandated staggered business hours to lighten the rush that is rush hour, better light timing, emphasis on, implantation of and general acceptance and use of quality mass transit, better pedestrian options, better driving culture, the rise of driverless cars, etc.

Many small, subtle changes can add up to very noticeable gains. 

 Of course, it would require us to sacrifice certain quaint values about quiet, empty suburban streets, but oh well. This is Houston. The city proper. If you want quiet suburban streets, move to Katy.

And no, I don't want to sacrifice the small amount of pedestrian friendly areas for something that there is no basis or evidence that it works. (unless there is which I'd be interested in reading)

Buy up houses that are in the way via eminent domain, bulldoze them, and build connections in there place. This would help immensely with traffic at a fraction of the price of building new highways.

Easy to say until your house is on the chopping block. Also, this would not be cheap. Imminent domain acquisition is expensive and time consuming. Roads aren't cheap. Bridges aren't cheap. Restructuring intersections (where do we add stop lights? where do we add stop signs? where do we create 4 way stops?) to take on the added weight of new thoroughfare traffic can't be easy.

 A couple decades was the amount of time it took to go from the first production of the V2 rocket to the first man in orbit. 20 years is a long time.

To act like it's unfeasible is just pessimistic shortsightedness. Obviously it's arrogance to think that it *will happen* because *America*, but it's nothing more than optimism to hope for it to happen.

 Why? He's from Canada, but has a tattoo representing his love for the city. He reps us hard. He considers us his second home. He loves Houston and considers himself a "Houston-mentored rapper". You should love the fact that someone with the pull of Drake reps so hard for a town he has no roots in. He gives us more national exposure than most of our homegrown guys (Bun B excluded - DJ Screw is legend status but outside of Houston and HH he is non-existent - Mike Jones was a cruel joke - Z-Ro, KeKe, ESG, wreckshop family, etc. all have in-state pull but that's about it).

Happy Delayed Drake Day! 




 He still graduated high school. It's on his transcript. They just aren't giving him the piece of paper that says he's a graduate of their school, but he is. A job/internship/school isn't going to ask to see your diploma ever.  




 I think FIFA has 3-4 backup countries that can host on the fly. USA, England, Germany, maybe France. It's a lot more than just stadiums.

 :p truth

 




 Nah no typo. Just rains more during rainy season but rains year round.  




 Nah, it really only rains for an hour max every day. Rest of the time it's blue skies and white clouds. So basically really concentrated verse England just being gloomy and wetish all the time. 

Really great weather. I actually lived in the town Nat Geo claimed best weather in the world in like 1990 or something.

 I don't really support it; I can't support it seeing as how I'm not a constituent of Louisiana. I'm just trying to rationalize it. Every issue deserves more than one point of view. It's important to see something you don't agree with and try to rationalize it without your opinions in view.

But I'm a bitch and a fool so what do I know. 




 with 16 what? 




 It's not a shock if you ever lived there. There are two seasons, rainy season and non-rainy season. It rains every day during non-rainy season.

It's nice rain though, usually in the afternoon, usually pretty hard for maybe an hour or so.

Laying under your tin roof during one of those rain storms is just the perfect nap time. Then the sun comes out, and the weather is perfect the rest of the time.

 Mine was off by default. I also rarely see spotify updates from other people on Facebook, so I'm guessing that's true across the board.

C'mon bitch, I dare you. Do it.  




 Maybe in response to the bonanza of 'loss of income' claims levied after deep water, which BP was pretty much just accepting without any actual trial. This concentrates the judicial power of the state into one entity. Now the small municipality who sees a cash cow can't just file a lawsuit and pad it's pockets.

I think the bit about any monies received must be used for wetlands protection supports this.

Anyways, truth probably lies somewhere in the middle and once again a lot of people are gonna be wholly misinformed because OP is wholly misinformed.

 I mean, I get that, but like, being official is pretty important for a lot of things. 




 That's his point?

Klinnsman was hired on his credentials. Klinnsman slams Kobe for being extended on his credentials. Wilbon slams Klinnsman for hypocrisy.  




 That was his point though. He got a contract to be coach based on his past actions, then he went and criticized Kobe Bryant for getting a contract based on his past actions.

He conveyed the point with absolutely no tact but I think that was what he was saying. 




 Michael Wilbon is a sports writer too. 




 He's an American but he isn't a citizen?  




 If you're not first, you're last. 




 They were tied, Ronaldo scored shortly after this in stoppage time.

Then he got fired.

Worth it? 




 Be worse at FIFA bro 




 If I remember correctly Ronaldo promptly scored after this. Pretty sure it was in stoppage time or close to 90 minutes.

So no, probably not worth it. They lost, he lost his job, he probably fired up Ronaldo which resulted in the goal.

 She is probably my least favorite casting on the show so far. I think the actress who played Ros would have been absolutely perfect for Shae and would have been a much better match personality wise with Tyrion. In that universe I wouldn't mind her taking the place of Penny. Gonna be interesting casting Penny though, are there any female dwarf actresses? 




 Huh. I'm sorry, were you expecting resolution in book 5 of, a minimum, 7 book series?

 "I don't spend..."

I probably spend an hour a day on the internet these days.

 




 Smurflogik, internet historian. 




 i did make an edit to amend my comment to not include smurflogik.

i could go into a majority of comment sections for posts on the front page, paste that onto one of the repost comments and it would be relevant. 




 Cool, did you like your new house? 




 you have an exceptional memory, i must admit 




 yeah see edit 




 How do you remember the exact year you saw that? You sure it wasn't 2002 or 2006? 




 See man, that's what you people just don't fucking get. I don't spend 15 hours a day on the internet but I see my fair share, and I've managed to never see this. You might have seen it 15 times, but this was my first.

Sometimes shit just slips through the cracks and you miss something. The simple enormity of the internet and all the content within is impossible for a single person to completely digest in *their lifetime* let alone the relative short amount of time that the internet has been churning out this content.

With that in mind, try to visualize all the stuff that you see for the first time that someone else has seen 15 times. Imagine trying to talk about it and the conversation revolves around the fact that it's "*a fuckin repost man*"

It's annoying. If you have seen something a billion times, what force drives you to go into the comments to let people know that you've seen it before?

I just picture you people in the real world, listening to someone tell a story that you'd already heard before.

"So there I was, sitting on the bench minding my own business when out of nowhe..."

"Dude, wtf, repost! you told this story already."

"Oh ya I did tell you! Sorry mate, but Patricia here hasn't heard it so I'm gonna keep going."

"Fuck Patricia, provide new content and stop being such a story whore"

"Fine... So there I was, sitting on the camel, minding my own busine..."

Patricia speaks up, "I've heard this, one stop telling it!"

e: i mean you're pretty chill about it but damn it's annoying when people act like they're above the repost

 




 Yeah when I was talking about vicinity to the light rail I meant Midtown. I do walk from the rail to my apt in montrose (Westheimer and Montrose abouts) every day after work and I don't think it's far (though it's starting to turn into a sweaty walk). I walk wayyyyy more than the average Houstonian to be fair.

There are a few bus routes that will take you there a lot quicker but I prefer the walk after work; gets my blood pumping a little. 




 Midtown sounds ideal, shouldn't be too difficult to find a place for $1,000, though might be a little more for the "perfect" spot. There are plenty of places that are pet friendly, but be prepared to pay an extra deposit for large breed. Midtown's population is predominantly young business types between 24-35, has quality night life, is about as central as you can get, it's close to downtown and the light rail (though fairly limited use depending on where your office is located).

Might also want to check out Montrose, there's a ton of large complexes going up and being finished right now. Montrose is just south of Midtown for an idea of the area.

The place you have in your post is pretty much right in between the two (Saint Danes is a great bar if you end up there - only a couple blocks away - and they're dog friendly).

 That was much closer in history than a hundred years ago. Our average precipitation is still 48" and we average over 100 days of rainfall per year.

 I'll tell someone I like their new Nikes - like Mikes - though that is traditionally reserved for 'street/urban shoes' such as AF1s, Air Max's, Dunks, etc. etc.. But for the most part yeah it's Nike like Mikey.

Nikes like Mikes is pretty much only for sneakerhead type shoes. 









 Sorry but that HEB is not only a better grocery store, but also a much better looking building and space. Love that they kept the big oak tree up in the parking lot. The high rise that's going up where fiesta once stood... now that is another matter.

Not really sure what would satisfy you if you can't find a bar in montrose that caters to your type of people. Yuppie bars, bro bars, hipster bars, gay bars, dive bars, cocktail bars, etc. etc., pick your poison. Also still an abundance of smaller retail outlets (which are seemingly popping up faster than your chains).

 




 But that's only because it's big... Per capita is not an important metric when talking about immigration. You can't say, "if Germany had the same population as the US, it's immigration numbers would reflect that increase".

 Like a social net to fall on once you hit the streets. I know life can be extremely difficult for felons outside of jail (US), from getting jobs to finding a place to live. I'd like to see the differences between Euro countries and the US in this because I'm guessing that has a lot to do with ire-offending rates. 

I also think a big problem is the cultural stigma attached to felons outside of prison. Someone does 4 years and gets out but never loses that tag that makes him different.  




 This was a great post until the last bit where you went completely over-the-top-smug.

I agree that prison is for rehabilitation but it is also a fucking punishment for the crime/s you've committed. While I 100% agree drugs should never land you in prison, and jay walking shouldn't throw you in jail; there need to be appropriate consequences for people's actions. This man raped, drugged and murdered at least one girl. He was a doctor who was in a position of extreme trust. He drugged other people so that he could rape in peace. He hid from society (at least French society) to avoid punishment.

All I'm saying is some people absolutely deserve the attention and humane treatment that fosters rehabilitation; some people deserve to sit in a jail for the rest of their lives and be reminded that being a member of society is something for people who don't rape and murder kids. 

Also correlation/causation all that.  




 Quite a bit more than that bud.  




 I like how one minute she says "we're about to three-pear(lol) and the next sentence she tells him to move to Vegas to become a psychic because that's all he's doing."

 He was a rocket a couple seasons ago, we're familiar with him :) 




 I'm pretty level headed and I get downvoted for innocuous posts enough for it to be slightly grating on my nerves. Just seems like a different set of rules are applied to Rockets flair than others. Been subbed here 3+ years, have seen a huge shift in general attitude towards us. Gotten to the point where I don't come here after negative Houston things because the hate train is so strong. Oh well.  




 I've stayed pretty far away from here :p 




 I agree with the first statement. Good pick up, overpaying him made sense as Dirks window is closing, just like it would have made sense for us if Bosh signed here. Think the Mavs will be pretty good this year (3-5 seed) 




 Frankly, my impression has been that Houston talks more shit about Dallas.

That's my impression as well and I've lived in Houston for 24 years out of a possible 26. 




 Right thought, wrong flair. 




 What's true? 




 No worries, it's mutual :p

Though I'd take you over a Mavs fan. 




 Been anti rockets for a while now. Kind of annoying.  




 Been hating the rockets for about a year and a half really. Ever since the Harden honeymoon was over.  




 Makes sense and I know he loves Houston. Even though apparently we treat all our players like shit now.  




 Remember his post draft interview? Golden.  




 Forgot about Ariza, thought you were calling TJones above average defender.  




 He butted heads with Adelman, got traded and I think he's playing overseas now. 

He was spectacular against LA though. 




 His post draft interview was spectacular (Rockets originally drafted him). He was so so so raw when he first got in the league though. Ended up playing 2 minutes per game w/ us for one season. 

Still a memorable player to me just because of his interview though. 

E: lol jk thought I was in the Joey Dorsey thread  




 see: flair 




 welcome to the life of a rocket fan on /r/nba.

subscribed here for 3.5 years. crazy how different rocket flair is seen from just 2 years ago. 




 Confidence is unwavering I feel like. Cockiness comes and goes.  




 When did I say that? We didn't have any players worth being franchise loyal to before Harden and Howard. Can you really blame the FO for not matching Parsons once Bosh was out of the equation? He'd would have been making more than harden. The Rockets would have had zero flexibility moving forward with a team that didn't make it out of the first round last season. 

I'll admit our roster has been a revolving door since Yao went down but franchise players don't just fall into your lap. Howard was obviously comfortable enough with the FO to take less over resigning with the Lakers.  /r/nba just has on shit colored spectacles when it comes to the rockets. 




 No, it counts towards luxury tax just not the cap. That why the NBA has a soft cap. Les would absolutely have been paying luxury tax.  




 See his comments last night? Doesn't appear so.  




 Asik didn't want to be in Houston. Do people not remember that? He was trying to move Asik to a team where he could play more and we wouldn't have such a redundant player. Did people really forget the whole Asik basically saying "trade me" after we signed Howard? 




 I'm sorry but how were Asik and Parsons treated poorly exactly? 




 Roy Hibbert? 




 Like shit? How was Parsons treated like shit? How was Asik treated like shit? Besides the jersey thing, which could have easily just been a marketing team's really dumb error, how was Lin treated like shit?

Parsons - we would have given him 15 million per and gone over the salary cap had Bosh chose Houston

Asik - besides giving him a contract most people scoffed at (including r/nba), we tried to trade him until the trade deadline last season after acquiring Howard. What else do you want? Teams to not get a significantly better player at the position you already have a guy at?

Lin - gave him a team to run and be the focal point of. Just happened to pick up a much better player later that offseason. Their skill sets overlapped.

You people seem to think that this is a church peewee league or something.  




 How was Asik disrespected? 




 You realize just last year we made a major free agent signing with Howard right? And the year before Harden happily signed our extension. We haven't had anyone to be loyal to since Yao faced premature retirement. Which player has the Rockets had in the past 6 years who deserved the kind of loyalty that Duncan, Dirk, Kobe, etc. got?

 




 It's a fucking organization worth hundreds of millions of dollars. In what universe are you expecting them to "be nice". Yeah, they didn't roll out the red carpet like a superstar for the guy, but he was treated extremely well while he was here and conversely he treated us extremely well. Had we signed Bosh, he would have been rewarded directly by us with an instant match of his offer sheet (which would have cost owner Les Alexander a tremendous amount of luxury tax). As it turns out he was rewarded, just by a team up interstate 45. 

What more do you want them to do? Be nicer? Jesus, this isn't Sunday school.  




 And we tried pretty fucking hard to trade Asik before the trade deadline. Fuck Morey for snagging the #1-2 center in the league, right? How else were we supposed to treat the guy? "Well Asik, we have a chance to sign Dwight Howard but we gave you a 3 year deal so we're stickin with you big guy!"

Give me a break guys, this is a cut throat business. 

E: also a funny point is that the reason it was so hard to move him last year was because of HIS FUCKING EXPENSIVE CONTRACT MOST TEAMS DIDNT WANT TO TOUCH! 




 They drafted him, gave him a starting role for 3 years where he has able to build up his product(him) to be worth 15 million dollars per year. By opting out of his 4th year option *they* created his market. Perfect storm for Chandler, desperate Cuban for a huge FA Signing.

So I'd say they did a little bit for him....  




 He could be the 3rd star if the first two were LeBron James and LeBron James.  




 He's done it 3 other times and matched instantly each time until now.  




 Our comparable Dirk would have been Yao. Yao's career ended prematurely. Sorry we weren't nicer to him so he'd stay injury free. You have to have that special player first before you can't treat them well. And I guess to get to that discount we have to overpay for him first (by the way think it's a good contract for y'all as Dirk's widow is small - but a bad contract for us). So while I think y'all are overpaying for him, it makes sense, like it would have made sense for us to overpay him if we had signed Bosh.  




 and the mods allow for all sorts of opinions. good community too.

thumbs up emoji 




 Fair enough, can't say I stuck my head into that area very much, or at all. I generally don't like 'fandom' or the entitled culture which surrounds a large population of sports observers/fans. Like, you (not *you* - the proverbial you) watch 3 fucking games a week, fuck off with your (not *your* - the proverbial your) self centered metric of success and constant diversion between throwing players under the bus when performing poorly and hand jobs when good abounds.
 




 I really like the writers on the Rockets blog 'The Dream Shake'. Good basketball analysis mixed with (from what I see) fair shakes at the players. 




 lol funny you said that. just spent like 15 minutes writing this up.

http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2agal2/lin_traded_to_the_lakers/ciusr4i

to answer your question: no, I stopped going to the forums a few years ago. 




 Yeah it's a pretty shitty forum. bsk4 must not have been going there for a long time. The whole contingent of 'player only fans' started with Yao when half of the posters were Chinese fans who only gave a shit about Yao and not the Rockets. Even before that though you had the old guard who would do nothing but compare the current squad to the championship era of Hakeem - dubbed 99ers (because they were original members when the board was founded in 99 - fun fact: i got banned from clutch fans about 5 years ago for telling Tinman (like The King of 99ers), to gobble on some dicks and stop talking the "good old days" so much). Honestly though, 'player/era only fans' aren't even the worst part. It's very knee-jerk, players (and coaches) get thrown under the bus constantly and are swiftly pulled out and kissed on the forehead when they play up to the expectations of entitled observers. Fickle, unintelligent posters abound, caution.

To be fair, there are a few posters there who are extremely solid and possess impressive basketball minds (DaDakota, Big Moe, HayesFan to name a few who stick out), unfortunately they get drowned out by what you're talking about. 




 I really did not see that much hate against him from Houston fans this past season. Apparently I missed it?

Always seemed like Harden took the brunt of the hate train when things weren't going as peachy as entitled fans thought they should be. 




 Houston is also just in general a huge market.  




 Crazy how much that trade nix changed the landscape of the NBA in the 2010s.
 




 Poor DWade. Opted out of his 22 million dollar contract hoping LeBron would stick around. Now he'll be lucky to get 12. 




 **11** letters - 9/**11**

1+1 = 2. 2 Names. Dick Cheney.  




 Yet people act like him being benched for Beverly was some personal slight against Lin. 'Basketball reasons' is actually athing. 




 Wait, what? My jimmies looked rustled from my comment? I had a smile on my face after getting eliminated from the playoffs this year because basketball is cool and fun and getting stressed or angry over it is silly. 




 This makes me so happy. This is like, better than an ice cold topo chico on a hot summer day. 




 People act like the Melo thing was Les and Morey getting together and being like, "Lets show how little we care about Lin". While it was much more likely something like the Rockets design team making a innocent mistake. 




 Getting benched for a player who better suited the starting lineup is getting treated like shit? I didn't see the hate towards Lin that a lot of people on this board talk about. The jersey thing was tasteless but it could have been something as innocent as the design team not thinking the whole concept through, not a deliberate shot at him.
 




 Yeah I don't remember the exact details except that the contracts were dubbed "Poison Pill Contracts".  




 That is the cap hit against Houston. Pretty sure it's the full 15 million for any other team. Could be mistaken though and maybe the 15 million cap hit was only been if the Knicks matched. 




 I've been on reddit for almost 4 years and I think your comment is like the 5th I've upvoted, so kudos on that.   




 just picturing you literally sitting on your computer incubating your comment until the right time. 




 Wrong Chandler

AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT! 




 Know what else wouldn't be fair? If Cleveland cloned LeBron 10 times and then bombed an orphanage.

Or if an elephant sat on the last bowl of ice cream.
 




 And Bosh just swishin 12-15 footers all day erry day. Bosh is such an obscene upgrade for our PNR defense alone. Jones was absolutely garbage in that capacity. His team D was atrocious.  




 Chandler is coming to Houston in this scenario though (i.e. the SW being the Rockets division to lose by getting Bosh and resigning Parsons). 




 Wait what? That is such a sleek Spurs move. You just won a championship, now you are tricking the Mavericks into joining your cause by making them think the Rockets are more of a threat to win it all than y'all.

Sly. Very sly. And that's why the Spurs are the best. 




 Honestly thought it was too big, still do for any team that couldn't go over the cap to sign him.

 




 And trying is half the battle! 




 win/win 




 Right but the reward is still the same. The reward in both scenarios is Parsons. The likelihood of retaining the reward simply increases the larger the contract is. Same reward - Parsons - either way.  




 You'll never hear me defend Kevin McHale as a good coach, bruh. 




 I know it doesn't mean shit, I was comparing two meaningless sets of statistics. 




 Do you seriously think the Rockets would have beaten the Spurs

I never said that, but Dallas didn't beat the Spurs either.

The argument was that Dallas played good against the champs, so did the Rockets. The Rockets didn't have to play against the champs in the first round because they played better than the Mavs during the regular season. See how dumb all these arguments are? 




 The more they offer doesn't increase the size of the reward, just the likelihood that they'll get to keep the reward. Same reward either way.  




 If you change the 16 years to 26 years our historical perspective looks better than y'all's. What's your point? 




 I'm sure players measure historical precedent when they're deciding whether or not to join a team with the mission of winning a championship.

Pack it up everyone, the Mavs have reached the 2nd round more often than the Rockets over the last 15 years, clearly they're the superior horse to ride going forward.   




 And the Rockets swept the champs in the reg. season.  




 Oh shit...my mistake.  




 Lol was just being silly. My error! 




 I read it as *will take* at first and was like argh ! ! !  




 thought you said it wouldn't matter without them 




 Uh no, I'm saying they wouldn't have won them without Odom, Pau and Co.

e: i misread you i guess? 




 It's not at all true.

 Nothing to lose? How about a chance to play in another World Cup game?

I highly doubt the team is sitting around going "whelp we made it this far, let's just cut loose cuz we got nothin to lose." 




 Disagreed 




 I got some serious asperger vibes from this post. 

"My mom wasn't there to introduce us" - as a 20 year 




 See, regardless of whether he ends up a Rocket next season or not is irrelevant. This is Morey 101, if he feels that Parson's is being overvalued by the market, he wipes his hands and wishes the player good luck. If the market dictates a price that Morey feels is not only within his valuation but also fits with his 'grand plan', he'll have a new contract waiting for Parsons before he gets on the plane.  




 Everyone's loyal until they aren't. I could see him giving a small discount (-10% max), but he's only been here 3 years, has no historical ties to the area, and he already helped us out big time in getting Howard (and just in general by being the best value in the NBA during his contract). Hope he gets whatever he deserves.   




 That or she doesn't remember what attractive is.  




 I enjoyed this. It gets a little slow on the back end of some of the lyrical verses at times but otherwise good stuff.  




 Ouch. I can see this on a late night monologue soon.  




 Agreed, instead of talking about basketball let's not talk about basketball. 

So how about that Elon Musk? Cool chap, aye?

 "karma" 




 satire? 




 teehehehehehehhee 




 While I agree the fans are better, it's definitely not more entertaining. Collegiate football is not nearly on the same skill level as the NFL, it's like saying you'd rather have an architecture student design your house because 'they're more passionate'.

The difference between the NBA and NCAAB is even bigger. 




 Suspend your disbelief and just enjoy the ride. You honestly have no way of actually knowing if something happened or not, so why get bent up with negative feelings that someone is "tricking you" for "karma"? 




 You take reddit way too seriously. 




 Therefore, they're all lies. 




 Thanks for letting us all know what is funny and what isn't funny, arbitrator of comedy. 




 he has said all the right things 

not that I disagree, but saying and doing are two very different things. he had the reputation for a reason. 




 No he signed an extension after the playoffs.  




 Bosh would have to take a min contract for that to work out.  




 Gotta beat them for a ring either way.  




 Really happy for Costa Rica. Spent one of the best years of my life living there during my senior year of high school (which incidentally was the last time y'all made it to the world cup - 2006). Unfortunately y'all didn't do as well then as you are doing now (think y'all went 0-3?).

Buena suerte Costa Rica!  
























 I deserved that. 




 I'm not really whining about it just explaining a possible explanation. Yes other countries get shat on, the US just happens to be the biggest target with lots of skewed perceptions which are easily mocked(fat, loud, proud bible thumpers), as well as it's cultural (and geographic) isolation from the rest of the world (American football, imperial system, military expenditures/incursions, healthcare system, tipping, not showing sales tax in the price, ez cheeze, etc.).

On top of all that, it's been the preeminent world super power for the past 70 years. The USSR was close militarily during the Cold War(really a wash because of nuclear arsenals, though with conventional weapons it lagged behind), although it lacked the economy to ultimately compete;  China is currently even economically (or a little bit stronger) but lacks the military projection that allows the US to dictate a lot of policy they wouldn't otherwise have the capability to pull off.

So you've got all these factors rolled into one country that's honestly just a big, easy, slow moving target for global mockery. It can get tired,  and it's like, we're exempt from sympathy because "we're like the rich white guys complaining about persecution".

The best part? When I respond in kind I'm just an ignorant, boorish American.

Oh well, I guess it's the price you've got to pay for your country's disproportionate influence on global affairs since the end of WWII. 




 My bad homie. 




 Oh well then thanks for doing your part to assure that the site continues to pump out quality content. You're a fucking warrior, bro. 




 Could you imagine everyone else in the world constantly shitting on you? Your country's shit, your country kills babies for oil, your country is full of fat people. Imperial system? Hur hur morons!, etc.

Our pride is a defense mechanism. It started as blind patriotism after WWII, but has since morphed into a defense mechanism. 




 cheers!

 




 Whining about karma is even lamer. 




 If I wasn't friends with anyone who called everyone in my country the worst people in the world I wouldn't have as many friends as I do. Sometimes you have to educate people with wrong views (me in this case), otherwise we're just a constantly divided people fighting over our respective borders and their contents.

I actually like Scotland and have never met a bad person from there, but sometimes when you're drunk and you're challenged on your aggressive drunk comments, you double down instead of correctly accepting your mistakes. 

So here I am, apologizing for the comment I made about your country and countrymen and hoping that we can bury the hatchet in the name of friendship. 




 that's as many people as my city. 




 So... friends? 




 Not ordering enough to have left overs is what's plain wrong. 




 Scotch is good. OK, I coneeded a point, now you need to conceed a point about America.

This is the only way we can grow as people and learn to love each other :)

I'm willing to hang up the hate hat if you are.

Friends? 




 It's pretty standard but a lot of places will also do like "3 meat combo with 2 sides", that kind of thing. Still by weight though. 




 Nothing better than the left over BBQ smorgasbord sandwich the next day.  




 Is a scot really trying to play "whose country has had a greater impact on today's world" with an ignorant yank? Bro, your country peaked in 1298 after the battle of Falkirk. Your most famous cultural attach is Willy the Groundskeeper from an American TV cartoon. Golf is nice to fall asleep to on a Sunday afternoon though, I'll give you that.  




 I'm pretty sure you buy by weight at Franklins. That looks like 1/4 lb of sausage, 1 lb of brisket and 1 lb of ribs. Certainly could be a single serving but just as easily could be for 2-3 people. 

Serving size may vary* 




 My favorite pizza topping is hyperbole :P 




 I'm pretty sure I said something to the effect of "scottish people are the anglo-world's equivalent to the runt of the litter".  




 OMG! He's using a linguistic contraction that developed in a localized culture over a couple hundred years! Let's point out that he's different than me and isolate him because of it! 




 If this is something visitors are concerned about when they visit the states, perhaps it is something that visitors could spend 20 minutes researching before they arrive as to avoid any potential confusion.

I'm know I'm going to learn and respect the cultural and commercial architect of the countries I visit and I expect others to do the same in my country. 




 This is a funny comment because I simply believe that we are different, and get frustrated that the way we do things is considered the "wrong" way. I don't think either system is inherently superior, they boil down to a divergence of extremely trivial cultural developments.

I've never said "not tipping is so STUPID how are you supposed to get good service if the server doesn't have the incentive of a nice tip" nor "including taxes in the sticker price of goods can create a misunderstanding and dissonance between the actual value of goods and their taxed rate".

Meanwhile I responded to a comment saying that "the system of tipping *is* bad, and an established living wage salary without tipping is a superior system", and "america is backwards for not including taxes on their sticker prices".

I was drunk and feisty in my responses, granted. However, even if I was exhibiting the dunning-kruger effect, how were you not? 




  but some things like alcohol, cigarettes, and gas have an additional tax in some counties or cities. 

These taxes are different than sales tax (they're 'vice taxes') and are already added to the price.

For instance, NYC has a very high cigarette tax but the sticker price reflects that from the get go.
 




 lol drunk redditing comes with it's share of hazards I guess :P 




 I dunno. Drunk redditing comes with it's own hazards.

freakin cobweb. 




 Ah the old 'Second Launcher' theory. 




 Right I just think it needed to be bridged better. For instance, "if you made it past child birth your life expectancy increases x amount and if you're male and make it past 21 it increases by x amount more."

Pretty pedantic on my part but how else are you supposed to drunk reddit? 




 Thanks mate and apologies. Drunk and belligerent redditing is good value :P yelling at strangers over inane crap is kind of cathartic in doses, especially when it diverges from your usual MO. 




 "well, and my brother greg." 




 Left Hand Free is like if Alt-J and The Black Keys had a song baby. I like it. Different than their usual sound for sure. 




 The thing with bone injuries, especially ones that severe, is the mental battle as opposed to the physical one. It's gonna be a slug fest against every instinct In his body saying "stop" before he gets to full speed.  




 "You get chased out of restaurants if you don't pay it"

Sounds like a solution to your problem?

"Sales tax vary"

Wahhhh, spend 3 fucking minutes of your trip planning on learning the sales tax of the states you'll be in. Americans get grilled for not being educated towards visited countries and yet we have to deal with this bull shit. 

Fucking god damnit it's not complicated. Fucking Australians are such shit for brains. I can deal with Brits lording over us but fucking Australians? Y'all are the Arkansas of the Anglo world. Honestly Scottish people make y'all look like New Zealanders.  




 I'm extremely empathetic towards suicide and persons who see no answer but it, but suicide can definitely be a 'selfish' act. I can honestly only speak for myself but dealing with depression, accepting it and so forth, the contemplation comes when you have narrowed your field of vision to such a sliver that honestly all you can think about is yourself. "Where do *I* fit in? Who am *I* really? Am *I* really worth it?

That's the thing I think, it's not selfish in the traditional sense of 'taking an extra slice of pizza when there's not enough to go around' but in the 'wow I'm so miserably self absorbed right now'.

But then seeing it first hand and it's reverberation through the person's family and friends; no matter how low I feel, how insignificant and inconsequential, no matter how inward and introspectively down I get,  I can always count on the sudden burst of 3rd person awareness that takes
Me out of me and allows me to not be selfish. 

It's a fucking battle, between you and yourself, where a part
of you that wants to die and it's selfish enough to try to drag the whole with it.  




 I'm just drunk and in the mood to argue to be frank.  




 Ideal circumstances with a light launchee and a heavy launcher and a perfectly inflated (not too full not too empty) blob for sure. The blobs kinda small though and the launcher looks average weight and from a relatively low jump spot.

Source: I blobbed a lot  




 No I know man you just presented your reasoning in a broken way. 




 Bitching about sales tax not being including boggles my mind. Do you honestly add everything up at a grocery store and have an exact figure in your head for what you will be spending, and then if you do, what the fuck is the difficulty with doing some basic multiplication with that basic addition? Y'all just bitch to bitch because it's not what you're used to. Fuck. Seriously infuriating. Y'all act like god came down from the heavens and declared tipping wrong and we're the only ones who ignored his sacred proclamation. You pay 4 fucking times as much for a pizza in Australia verse the US and you twats still have the nerve to whine about an expected *BUT NOT REQUIRED* 15% service charge. Good god you whiney fucking cunts.  




 I think you're under thinking it.  




 10m still isn't 50' ya dumb cobweb.  




 "This is reddit, where I go to postulate." 




 While truish, 50' seems like a "I was there you shoulda seen it"
exaggeration. She looks about 30' tops. Still some serious air. 




 And yet you ingrates still fucking bitch about having to tip on the larger and less expensive meal. 




 Yah but zero is your first name day so 14th name day is 13 years old.  




 You say infant mortality is the reason then you say if you made it past 25.  




 If you made it past infancy you could expect 60-70 more years on average.  




 We beat the Titans once last season doe. It was the last time we won a game. It was almost a year ago. Lol. 




 Dream big or move to Tennessee.  




 Is it crazy that I believe we are going to win more games than we won two seasons ago?

 




 More like a death tarp. 




 I mis-read it as a combination of peanut butter, Nutella and the powder.

Just pictured a bowl of those 3 ingredients with a banana on top. Ta-da! Healthy! 




 Check out seapoint farms roasted edamame products. Great snack because a serving actually fills you up. High in protein and fiber. Wasabi flavor is good and so is lightly salted. 4.5 grams of fat, 14 grams of protein, 7 grams of fiber in 1/4 cup.  




 On the spectrum of pork products it's one of the less healthy choices however.  




 Hummus has protein but it doesn't have a ton of it. Talking like 2 grams per ounce. 




 He said healthy lol. That's like 80% fat and sugar.  




 Or it's a reaction to a helicopter getting shot at. 




 Tilt! 




 Maybe statistically but they were exposed big time when Ibaka was out.  




 My arm-chair meteorologist theory is that Ike left a huge pressure bubble in Texas and as a result storms have been unable to form or move through the area. Seems like it's starting to return to normal. 




 A story on the internet is not admissible evidence in court. 




 Right - just saying that generally there isn't any math to do at the supermarket. 




 I've only ever seen price per ounce unless it's one of those dry food stuffs self bag by weight in which case it's by pound.  




 Should probably incorporate food in there somewhere though! 




 Not that I don't think it's outrageous but how is it *illegal*? 




 When you get your confirmation from uber/lyft you get the drivers name, picture and car make/model/color though? And how would you steal a fare with lyft/ubers system?

Could see this with a taxi service, a la the bone collector though.  




 Actually, a couple years ago the Rockets were the little underdog team that everyone on /r/nba loved. The dichotomy in my interactions on this subreddit between now and then is crazy.  




 How is it entrapment? 




 In the article it mentions conservative/GOP support for uber and lyft.  




 Failing to see the irony.  




 Feel like this will hit harder at home than against it's intended targets. Russians rely on cheap imports which these sanctions will impact. Yes it will hurt the West economically but the quickest way to lose a population's support is to come between them and feeding their families.  




 Yeah I was at the last win last season. Sprained my ankle leaving the stadium. Pretty sure I cursed the team.

Sorry, everyone. 




 *puts on gun*

Actually, *pew pew pew*. 




 True but technically it was also 2-10 at one point. 




 What an awful year for Mr. McNair. 2-10 and a battle with cancer. Glad to hear his health outlook is sunny, hopefully his team follows suit.

Outside of Kraft, there aren't many owners as generous nor humble as McNair. 




 *puts on milking frock*

Actually, tipping a cow causes it's utters to plug themselves due to gravity and general cow stuff, greatly decreasing it's milk output. Though fun, this is not an effective way to milk a cow. 




 You're on the right, right?  




 *tips hat* 




 *Puts on cowboy hat*

Actually, they have both. Most rodeos are attached to livestock shows, of which cows are a big part, with the best ones often out earning the top bull riders for their owners. 




 You're brave for saying that though.  




 Yeah I don't like yellow cab drivers. They're bad at their job. Glad a better service is getting a shot at dethroning a nearly monopolized service. So, kinda the opposite of bitter. 

edit: seems like everyone else here is bitter. 




 You realize you're comparing a movie that hasn't come out to a movie that is out, which is what you were whining about in the first place, brah? 




 Putting words in his mouth. He said he thought Intersteller would be his favorite movie this year, it still is in the running but now it will be competing with GOTG.  




 You could just bookmark it. 




 Well then I guess you'll have a continuing user base once the better product wins over the majority.  




 I meant poor people.  




 Maybe they've updated it since my last use. Regardless, I didn't switch to exclusively uber/lyft because it's a worse service. 

And yes you could enter the address but I was saying that the address service wouldn't be able to find a lot of the addresses I was using. 

And from one anecdote to the other, I constantly had drivers try to swindle cash over card. Sorry bud, you're required by law to have a working credit card machine. 




 HailCab was nicer than calling for a cab but the app pales in comparison to its lyft uber counterparts. It's location service was unreliable and often wouldn't be able to find the address you entered. Compare this to uber/lyft which utilizes GPS (or you can manually enter an address) and you are automatically paired with a driver which you can see in real time in the app. Also I found that every time id ask to pay with a card on hailacab, the driver would claim I put cash even when of show them my confirmation ticket.

It's just a superior service in every way.

Source: I use(d) lyft/uber and yellow cab 4-5 times a week.  




 Or he's just one of those guys that doesn't trust "institutions".  




 A simple solution like a dedicated uber/lyft card similar to transit cards. Honestly though not many people utilize taxis anyways because they're expensive for the mile to dollar. 




 The new Spoon album is soooo good.  




 While I get where you're coming from and kids missing that long *rarely* return home alive; they *never* return home alive if they're found dead. If it's not a hoax she's dead, if it is a hoax she's *maybe* still destined for a happy ending. No matter how small the probability it's still astronomically higher than someone coming back to life. That's why I hope it's a hoax.  




 I mean, I agree, and you say that, but I wonder, how many, side bar pictures are a result of those photog,raphers 




 Nah like a figurative push in the right direction.  




 Curious why Houston is The Netherlands most popular NBA team. Can't think of any Dutch in the NBA and esp. not on the Rockets.  




 "steal" lol. same people who think that's stealing don't think piracy is stealing. 




 Menil Park and check out Rothko Chapel. Great quiet and chill spot.  




 Double Trouble is great. My rail stop is right there and I'll go grab a Drink and chill after work once a week or so. Get a Suffering Bastard.  




 Also Mercantile. Usually way less crowded, good coffee, beer, wine and other treats. Plus they have a swing inside so there's that.  




 I know :(

Ah what could have been. 




 Excuses? They're not excuses, they're reasons.  




 Still would have had to have gotten past (the spurs I think?) in the WCF. 




 Sadder than Derrick Rose tearing his ACL in the playoffs 2 seasons ago only to come back and do it again the following season?

Hope he bounces back this year, he's a humble and hungry super star. He deserves a healthy rest of his career. 




 God I fucking ***LOVED*** Von Wafer. Went so far as to name my indoor soccer team 'Von Wafer'. He came in after T-Mac went down and just fucking balled so hard.

That team had so much fucking swag it made swaggy p look like just regular p. Artest, Scola, Lowry, Wafer, Hayes, Yao, LANDRY, Fucking DEKE!, Battier.

Honestly think if T-Mac was healthy, Deke didn't end have a career ending playoff injury, and Yao was healthy (though he finished the series with the Lakers) they would have gone to the finals. Shoot I think even with just a healthy Deke in the Lakers series we could have pulled off the upset (took them to 7).

That team and the 22-win streak team the year before have a very special spot on my heart. What made me grow to truly love basketball as a fan. 




 Easier for the viewer to differentiate if each one has something decidedly unique about them (although they seemed to do that by making them all such different ethnicities).  




 Assuming he's talking about soy milk.  




 All smaller chains/independent stores are more expensive. I have a Starbucks and an independent store close to me. Independent store is 3.00$ for what costs 2.50$ at Starbucks (iced coffee). Granted the independent store is higher quality but outside of the gas station you're not gonna find a cheaper(cost) regular brewed coffee. Starts getting expensive when you order coffee milk shakes but those are expensive everywhere.  




 Mourning has been. Curiosity got the best of me. Just him, Hardaway and MJ.   




 Do the Heat have any retired numbers of their own? Alonzo Mourning? Hardaway?  




 I don't like you anymore.  
























 Shiner and German Chocolate Cake. Thank you German Texans. 

 




 What was so great about them? 




 They can be baked or fried.

 Nah he was just pushing it up like a push pop and kind of scrunching down the sides. Pretty ingenious if you don't have a spoon.  




 Though you're being sarcastic, I am truthfully a kind person. I might falter occasionally but it's something I believe is a very simple way to positively influence your immediate surroundings.  

Any who, he's not the subject, focus or punch line; the morning box of chocolate ice cream is. And my first thought was, "what's that dude eating", followed by "can't be ice cream", followed by "wow it is ice cream", followed by "I should take a picture", followed by "I want some now". 




 "Maybe there's one deeper, I'll just stick my dick in there and wiggle it around a little to make sure." 




 I've just never seen anyone eat straight out of a big box of ice cream like a push pop, at 8:30 AM and in public. Found it amusing, no judgement.

He honestly didn't seem healthy though. He was slurring when he was talking to the bus driver and was doing what looked like the heroin nod when he wasn't munching on his box.

Could have just overdosed on chocolate though. 




 Technically it's also ice cream after dinner. 




 You should have seen him when he was done.

The epitome of "I've made a huge mistake" face. 




 There's usually a wait on weekdays, it's just not an hour. Usually like 20 minutes. Maybe not in the summer though. 




 How much do you think letting go of Mankins contributed to this?  




 Oh my gosh, fake internet points I totally don't care about. Better whine. 









 That's Spurts for ya. 




 Transformers 4 has grossed a billion dollars though... 




 Like your mom. 




 Implying you are now OK with it? 




 I love to think that my mom doesn't lie when she calls me handsome. 




 If you're hung over every weekend for the past 7 years like clockwork, you're an alcoholic. It's OK, we've all been there. I've been there. I just don't have the same quick recovery time I used to so I had to cut back. It's not a bad thing, it's just a thing. But yeah I'm probably sheltered for pointing out that you spend 1/7 days a week hungover and that's not an outlier (which for your age range probably isn't - but this isn't just your age range).

 




 Do you know what average means? You obviously cover the high range. A lot of people obviously cover the low.

Not that it's not bullshit, but just because you're an alcoholic doesn't mean everyone is. 




  Here in Canada and the US, we pretend we never even had concentration camps, and ours didn't even involve genocide.

Huh? Learned about internment camps in WWII in middle school and high school. 




 To invent your own life's meaning ***is not easy***

Apparently it wasn't easy to read to the end of the comic, either. 




 Can you expand on that at all or are you just being contrary? 




 Define douchey.  




 But think... you might not have such a high regard for the brand if not for those contracts.  




 If you have to ask... 




 Except you know, all the rich people that don't live like that, of which I'm guessing is the majority. But yah... 




 I mean, you're spending over 100,000k min to buy a fucking status symbol, it's inherently snobby. There are cheaper cars for the performance value but people don't usually buy Ferraris for the 'raw power'. 

It's astounding to me that the majority of commenters here are surprised that a company that caters exclusively to the the rich is snobby about their product. *They fucking have to be.* 




 Not really. Brand integrity is crucial to their business model. It's stupid to not read what you sign though, yes.  




 They're not coming to Texas period :( I hate when that happens and I just don't understand why you wouldn't include Houston, Dallas or Austin in your tour. It's not out of the way between the West and East coast and there are a lot of people here. 




 Well, it says that exact thing on the song page, so there really isn't much to argue about.

 Acorns freeze, pecans don't. If it freezes, it's an acorn. 




 Kind of the opposite really.  




 Here's some advice, don't let it get to you. Don't assume something that's just gonna make you annoyed. Why? 




 If only people could just ignore the things that they've already seen, or at least stay out of the comments so that the discussion isn't centered around how "we've already seen this; we already know this." 




 It's just a bunch of lame whiteys. You're better off not going. 




 He's basically a spider man clone, but a little different I guess. It came out in the past couple of years. Don't know much about it just know that he's a new marvel super hero based in Houston and based off of Spider-man. 




 It's almost like people learn things at different points in their life. And it's almost like everyone doesn't see every single post ever posted to reddit. But thanks for letting us know you already knew this and for constructively contributing to the conversation. 




 I know. I expected them to be bland and uninspiring, like Flacco. 




 Joe Flacco's wooden personality led to the colossal failure of McDonald's Mighty Wings. He is so stiff and boring that even Colin Kaepernick's movie star looks couldn't carry the ad campaign.

 It's not a pecan and it's not too big to be an acorn because it is an acorn. 




 Nah it's an acorn. Freeze it right when it hits the floor. Clearly not a pecan. 




 Ah yes, the episode with the Randy Newman.  




 Probably the other way around. That was published in 2012 and the chicken gag started in the first run of Family Guy so sometime in the early 2000s.

 Oh. Darn. 




 Yeah it's not the same, the toaster over is better.

Makes sense, pizzas are born in ovens and not on stove tops. 




 Way more fun than the broken record that says "You must be fun at parties". 




 Damn thought I had top /r/NBA scorer on lock. 




 280 PPG and 5.85 Assists.

God? 




 I did the skillet thing for a little bit, but the toaster oven is just much easier, same result, and no extra cleanup. Can even throw the broiler on for a minute to brown the cheese. 




 Throw it under the broiler for a minute. 




 That's not a movie... 




 Half siblings =/= step siblings.

I think half siblings have the same genetic similarities as 1st cousins. 




 It's because procreating with someone you share familial genetics with (i think up to 1st or 2nd cousin?) has a pretty high chance of resulting in a genetically insufficient baby. And also the taboo factor. 




 I legit don't care about your sleeping habits.

 Well, horseradish with mustard, starch and green food coloring.

Wasabi is hard to grow and cultivate, so most places outside of Japan feature the horseradish surrogate. 




 I think you really saw the brilliance of BB's coaching when Brady went down a few seasons ago and they managed 11 wins with what's his face. 




 Ha no I know. He's definitely a great coach. Definitely one of the best, and is one of the best 'talent managers' any sport has ever seen. The most talented team doesn't always mean they're the best team, but he made sure they were. I do however believe that from an Xs and Os standpoint, Pop is the front runner.

You don't just stumble into 11 championships by being a so-so coach though. 




 Well 8 of his 11 championships featured a player named Michael Jordan. 




 Man it would be so embarrassing if people knew I looked at naked ladies online. 




 I've heard way more vocal support for it's preservation into something usable. 




 Gotcha. 




 You said they can start buying houses after they go around the board once. Or I guess you just meant in the general construct of time.  




 : 




 Alert alert: alert 




 Duh alert: duh 




 I can't agree with that just based on the staggering amount of talent that was dumped in his lap. Now I think it takes a very special kind of coach to be able to lead those types of players, but I don't think he's as good of a coach as Pop. 




 But he isn't an editor. He's a random guy posting an article to a news aggregator site populated by pedantic, finicky assholes. 




 How can you buy houses without a monopoly? 




 It's not the key, it's the exploit of a broken game.
 




 It could have been worded better.

 Right-o good chap.

 OK. Shutting up.

 It's great. I cut them up into slices and scoop up the yogurt. Really cuts down the chalky/dry of 0%. I use fag and its my favorite of all the ones I've tried. A cup of yogurt and 1/2 or a full red pepper. Fills me up.  




 Raspberries, bananas and apples tend to do the trick for me.  




 Eggs (I do one yolk per 4 egg whites for flavor/fat), bananas, raspberries, edamame or baked soy beans, celery/red peppers w/ 0% Greek yogurt, black beans. Basically anything dense in protein/fiber.  




 You keep division rivalries if you keep divisional playoff seeding, because your greatest threat to the playoffs is still your inter-division equal.

 Hi, you shouldnt let innocuous comments create real world rage.  




 Hi, you must be new here.  




 Reposts aren't pure evil.  




 Just saying it's hard to objectively compare stats between different positions. Just as far as getting a body on the ball carrier, LBs are in a consistently better position to do so. Von Miller is a phenomenal player though, don't get me wrong. 




 Von Miller is also a LB while JJ Watt is a DE. 




 That's erect

Good spot. 




 It's funny because this is a bad photo lol. 




 Thanks but none of us played. 




 Compare the amount of NBA players in FIBA to the amount of NBA players in the WNBA.

It's pretty simple really. 




 They act as if WNBA (or women's basketball in general) topics are a constant plague of this subreddit

dude... no body acts like that. 




 Jesus Christ, not everyone is an audiophile nerd. Some people value percieved value and style over ultimate value. The average person will not be able to tell the sound difference between audiotechnica mh50s and beats but everyone will be able to see the difference.

We get it guys, your $100 steinhouses are superior to beats in every single way. Guess what? No one gives a shit. You're a bargain shopper, pat yourself on the back and get over it. 




 Well, they are friends with the biggest kid on the playground.  









 haha I'll do that. I really dig the sound, man. Sign something for me in case y'all get famous?

 Baked beans, despite the name, are usually stewed. 




 Nice man! Should share them. Just started getting into him when this newest album came out, and was hooked by Summer Cum.  




 Re-fried beans can be fried or baked.  




 the raw beans can be cooked when dry or soaked overnight, then stewed, drained of most of the remaining liquid, and converted into a paste with a masher (such as a potato masher), or pressed through a fine mesh sieve (to remove the skins). Some of the drained liquid, or chicken or vegetable stock, is added if the consistency is too dry. The paste *is then* ***baked*** or **fried** with lard or vegetable oil and seasoned to taste with salt and spices.

 Whoa man, super intellectual and daring examination of society's flaws.  




 If Cowboys are Texans and Cowboys are American Icons than Texans are also American Icons. Also Chandler.  




 Stick with it man. 18 months no internet or cable for me. 88 pounds lost, no more depression, no more social anxiety, more girls, more friends, more adventures, more life. Obviously there was a lot more that went into that but cutting the Internet and cable was the first step which allowed me to start taking more and bigger ones. It's possible and you might find one day that not only do you not miss it but you relish the freedom of un-connectivity.  




 Cut the internet too. I did it about 18 months ago, said goodbye and it has been the best change I've made in a really long time. You people are lying to yourselves if you think you *need* it. 

For me personally it was a health and lifestyle decision but not supporting those monopolies with my business has been a nice side effect. 




 As opposed to the creative masterpiece of a name that is 'Cowboys'. It just makes it too busy, is in a weird spot, and just doesn't fit. Sorry, Chandler. 




 I like the white ones but the blue ones need to lose that Dallas Cowboy star. 




 Obama didn't de-escalate anything in Iraq. He left on the timeline Bush negotiated after trying to renegotiate to keep US troops there longer.

Bush signed the SOFA Accord but the war *was still going on* and Obama was the one who presided over the actual complete withdrawal of US combat troops from Iraq. It's one thing to sign such an agreement at the end of your final term and another to actually follow through on it. The SOFA Accord was signed 5.5 years after the invasion of Iraq. Lets not pretend that Bush ended anything. He introduced the framework for his successor, but his successor still had to end the hostilities. Would McCain have backtracked on SOFA had he been elected? If you believe yes (which his words leading up to the election would indicate), then how could you not agree that Obama was the one who actually ended the war? We invaded without UN approval, what makes you think a flimsy withdrawal agreement couldn't have been superseded?

He increased the troop numbers in Afghanistan for years with no benefit, or clear mission, before finally pulling back troops.

The idea was the same coin as the successful 'troop surge' in Iraq during Bush's presidency. Just like in Iraq, it worked until the surge subsided. The problem with both conflicts was that there was *never* a clear desired outcome, we wandered in without a goal and with outdated strategy and the people of Iraq and Afghanistan paid the price.

He completely botched Libya

How so? The goal was to support dissidents of Qaddafi in a bid to oust him from power, which was accomplished with intelligence sharing and the targeted strikes of Libyan military assets. Unless you mean botched as in he botched it by getting involved in the first place; an assertion which time will paint a more detailed picture of and you could very well be right on.

and funneled weapons to Syrian rebels, many of whom were Islamist terrorists.

I'm not going to argue with you on that one. I really don't know where I stand on the whole Syrian Civil War or our involvement.

He tried to get involved in Syria very early on and only backed down when there was a large public backlash. You don't remember the whole redline comment?

See, the fact that he backed down when there was a large public backlash is an important point to me.

Obama doesn't get credit just because he didn't get involved in every little skirmish.

When your country has been at the forefront of foreign military intervention since the 1950s, I think you should get a little credit when your foreign policy shifts slightly from that precedent.

Bush had international support when he started his wars, too, as well as congressional ***and UN approval***.

Not in Iraq. International support was paltry at best and UN approval was non-existent.

If anything, he's doubled down on all of the previous administration's follies.

I just can't agree with that when one of those admins started two separate trillion plus dollar ground wars and the other didn't. 

I'm just saying Obama is not anything like the peacenik you're trying to paint him as.

I'm not painting him like a peacenik, I just disagree that he is a war-hawk.

His foreign policy isn't perfect. Far from it, it's lukewarm at best. I don't agree with a great deal of his foreign policy but I do think it's a step in the right direction away from his predecessor (because tepid isn't great but it's better than scalding water for washing your hands).

You should take off your blinders and see what he's really been up to.

You should save the personal attacks for personal arguments.  




 100% false. Bush ended the Iraq war, Obama wanted to stay.

If Bush ended the Iraq war, how could his successor want to say?

The Iraq War didn't end until December of 2011, Obama was elected in 2008 and took office in January 2009.

Nice rebuttal, you're off to a good start. 

Um...Do what? Limited by what standards? No occupation?

Uh, yeah. Limited as in limited. Limited as in minimizing war resource allocations.

We always try and claim international support. We did the same thing in Iraq.

Well we *did* initially have a lot of international support in Afghanistan and Iraq to a lesser extent but then we stayed there for a decade, and rightfully lost it.

You seem to think unless we are invading and occupying everything is ok.

I absolutely do not think that, and for you to jump to *that* conclusion based off my comment tells me more about you than you not knowing which president ended the War in Iraq (and confidently not knowing it to boot).

The only thing he hasn't done is a full scale invasion....everything else is 100% Bush policy.

Right...the only thing he hasn't done is get the US stuck in 2 separate trillion+ dollar wars which significantly hurt our international standing and isolated us from our allies.

But I mean really, Obama's foreign policy diverges enormously from GWB's, for better or for worse. 

 




 Firkin and Fenix seems to have a divese NFL crowd, and it plays all the games.  




 Care to elaborate? De-escalated/ended war in Iraq from US presence standpoint; de-escalating Afghanistan from US presence standpoint; limited involvement in Libya (air strikes + intelligence); limited/no involvement in Egypt; limited/no involvement in Iraq/Palistine; refusal to join the fight in Syria for 4 years; no action in Ukraine; delayed action against ISIS until now (according to the West chatterbox). And you look at the conflicts we've been involved in (that weren't inhereted) and they share the common bond of international support. 

If anything he's been trying very hard not to repeat what he saw as the previous administration's biggest folley.  




 This is neat and all but you're not even gonna post any picture?  




 Apparently you're wrong dude because he didn't get a red.  




 If the NFL was smart, he'd be the player face of the NFL.  




 Maybe y'all are both just fat. Just because she puts sugur in her coffee doesn't mean she's wrong. It just means she's a hypocrite and y'all both tub. 









 Man and I thought I was creative for rolling my filters into my initials.

 Man I couldn't even imagine swiping right 6,000 times. What's your guesstimate on your match ratio per right swipe? I'm at like 1/10 but prob only swipe right 1/10 of the time. Kind of curious what would happen if I swiped right on the next 200 girls.  




 You forgot about the choking hazard that comes with anything edible :p 




 I know, I just was curious how many times 300k went into 2.5 billion. 




 It would take them 8,333 days to recoup 2.5 billion dollars at that rate. 




 That's impressive in a collectibles kind of way. Selective swipes or do you just go full right? 




 How long did that take? 




 Well real coke can kill you by itself under the right(wrong?) circumstances but I get what you're saying.  




 Shrooms can kill you too if you're unlucky.  




 You need a new coke dealer.

 That was supposed to have quotes around it suggesting you said it. Oh well.  









 Well... Better than your usual Friday where you do absolutely nothing with your life. So instead of nothing, you just created something absolutely retarded and which will never get used. You'll be happier when you try outside of rreddit.  




 Oh em gee, reddit gold, my completely blas life still means something. Fuck, I'm lonely.  




 S'all good. I understand where you were coming from, and it definitely could have led to personal bashing, but that was never my intent :) 




 Follow your dreams, bro. And update us when it happens. 




 Haha really? You're not Michael too, are you? 




 Why'd you want it? It's just my first initial + my last name. 




 It's funny because before he went to the Mavs he claimed he was buddy-buddy, best friends with Dwight. 




 I know... The whole point was that Central Park is super busy so people throwing organic refuse in it would not be the same as throwing it in the woods with little foot traffic and lots of space.

Central Park - Lots of Space, lots of foot traffic = not good to throw organic refuse (see: lots of traffic)

'a park' - minimal space, low traffic = not good to throw organic refuse (see: minimal space)

'the woods - lots of space, minimal traffic = fine to throw organic refuse. (see: lots of space, minimal traffic)

Hope that makes sense. I'm sure we're on the same page, just not connecting for whatever reason. 




 Well obviously there would be more to it than just saying "standardize them" on the internet. Just because a problem is complex and complicated doesn't mean there aren't solutions. At the very least, ban any future stadiums from using the same design the Texans have implemented.

 Standardize for indoor and outdoor.  




 Oh man, not your feed! Everyone, this guy's feed is wasted with people overly excited about their sex lives. We must correct this immediately; from now on, no sex posts. Hope that helps, yanks209.

If it really bothers you just filter out the words you see a lot that you don't like to see, like 'sex', 'blowjob' and 'fingerblasted'.

edit: see, if you guys just downvoted and ignored the sex posts like you did my comment, you might end up with content you want. hope my sacrifice was productive. 




 Not really. Not with the amount of foot traffic it gets. Sure it's big, but it probably has more foot traffic per acre than your average small neighborhood park.  




 I know man. I wish there were more mature adults like us on Reddit. Kids these days. Amiright? 




 Yes, pretty big for a park in the middle of a city, but it's not 'the woods'. It's what, 800 acres? With what, 30 million visitors a year?

 




 Shiner is though.  




 Pretty sure psychiatrists are legally obligated to bring it to the attention of police. Could have just pulled that out of my ass, too lazy to fact check.  




 There's a difference between a park and 'the woods'.  




 I do that but I roll my cigarettes and usually don't have a filter. And I also pick up random trash a lot because I do still feel a little guilty. Also I don't drive so at least I'm not contributing that problem. *ahem*
