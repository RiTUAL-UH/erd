 I could have even made weakness potions, but time and the game were not on my side...
 




 I could have even made weakness potions, but time and the game were not on my side...
 




 lol, Ice, there is no July 32nd :D
 




 Does it close and reopen 20 minutes before?

 




 Well, tbh, if he said not to use the command, then don't use it, and don't be that guy... 




 Actually at the time I am typing this, it is 17:35. 




 It will be quite a treat seeing all the new faces we may see during and after this event! Just remember, always be respectful to the host, and never cheat! 




 Make sure you don't have ./nick enabled, that allows people to change their name and causes problems. 




 :(
 




 Be there once more, hopefully better this time!

 




 Be there again, and no babies! 




 I only had like 9 :D 




 Although I didn't win, I'll have you know I also had a power 3, and died because you didn't have more arrows! :( 




 }:) 




 I've trucked through the only matches I've played of it, but through all of them, I have learned that baby zombies need to hit less as hard and have less health. Right now they are basically small, fast zombies, and any health I lose is to them. 




 Ice, have I ever told you how much I love your games? Because I do! Although, if this is the last 1.5.2 match, I may lose my always going to meetup and dieing streak, because baby zombies. 




 Maybe Ice will host? That be awesome! :D
 




 That doesn't seem right though, it says the 21st for blackie's?
 




 mwahahahahaha 




 I'll (try to) be there! 




 Your not alone, I did too :'(
 




 Or not :( 




 :D
 




 I'll be there again! 




 I thank him too, I wonder when there will be a game without us in it, or one with Jacob in it. 




 Earlier today huh, I'll still be there though!
 




 I'll get you this time! 




 Yeah, I had similar gear as shadowlego, and 5 golden apples (+ full health) and was against the wall, but then someone attacked with what I assumed was a strength potion or a really good sword, while 3 others were   charging at me, and died in one hit. I didn't even get to heal due to as many people as there were. 




 I would recommend next time, just ban him. Don't make a long lengthy deal over it, it makes the game worse. Better luck next time! 




 To those who would want to play in these matches, I would recommend not to. The OPs were spawning mobs to get rid of particular players, and down right annoy others. I had about 20 bats spawned on me on one occasion. Other players (regardless of who they were) had creepers spawned on them. I would not recommend playing these matches until their games are fair, and tolerant. 




 I am sorry, but that seems like the, "If it doesn't impact me, then i don't care about it." or basically, you don't care about anyone but yourself. I'm sorry if I offended you, but its my opinion. 




 okay, sure i see, but how many people dont use that chat, or want to organize all their information? It gets a bit hectic to do it in chat. There are also many that arnt in that chat that want to play games, and get their games from the subreddit. Believe it or not, but a lot of people DON'T use the skype chat. 




 Not to be rude, but, where else is there? 




 Those who are trusted by the host, not all, I understand you, but there are those who would not play fairly, however, I don't see them often or at all. Many on the UBL though do play fairly. I personally want to stay out of this one, but just clearing that up. 




 I assume that he meant 22:30 UTC or 6:30 EDT because PDT is strange to use without EDT unless you live there. (Also, JOHNNY, UTC from PDT is +7) 




 You didnt put the IP in the post guy, whata doin!?
 




 Wanting me to "shut the fuck up" when i am asking a question just shows that you cant take criticism, and i was merely asking a question for why you would say something that was not a sign of good hosting. You dont have to tell me what i already know. 




 I would love to play again, your guys server was all right with 15 people, so you shouldnt have a problem with 25. (Also, I like endurance ffa's, the ones with no time limit, hint hint nudge nudge.) 




 Was fun! Started as the first one to take damage, and went on to win! 




 It didn't matter who said it, i was merely asking why it said that, when that obviously is not a sign of good hosting. Replying "shut the fuck up" also is not, and was completely uncalled for, I replied back as narrow minded as you did. I'm not the only one that had a problem with your matches, or this being the first, and I'm sure, not the last, you may want to learn to respect people before they will respect you, and don't go "you swore at me, nyanya" While it may not have been one of the most mature things I've done, you swore at me first, and I don't "bow down" to hosts, I play with them mutually, and respect them. You, I have no respect for whatsoever.  




 Sounds like wdornbach to me, his hosting is very similar.
 




 That doesn't give much context, why did he deserve to be banned?
 




 Apparently you could have logged back in, and I had asked the host (who, contrary to what it says here, was t4t4t4t4, not actually_yes) why he had not replied, and he said he was afk. I then complained that he had said "this is an impromptu, do not complain about lag and bad hosting" and i said that gave no right to not host correctly. To that, actually_yes replied with "shut the f*ck up" and i replied back as narrow minded as he did. He then banned me for: faggot. 




 He is a very clever man, but apparently not enough, you sir brought this to light, so that we know to avoid this name too, thank you.
 




 Hopefully you will do better than he did with it. :)
 




 No no, -10/10
 




 However, curious why people were still on, I logged onto the server, to see if this was still going on, it appears that wdornbach said he had lost the server, and no longer owns it, so hopefully we wont see him anymore. 




 I would have claimed that before the point of wdornbach killing people, that he was just making honest mistakes, but at the point he just went and killed people, he was being incompetent, especially because he never replied at anything ever said in chat. He is a horrible host, no because he didn't know what he was doing, but because of the things he did know what he was doing. 




 were you still in game? can you not get on either?
 




 I am not whitelisted D:
 




 I personally think you could do well, but here is some feedback:

-Don't make PvP instantaneous, turn it off until first night or second day.
-Make the spawn box bigger and within the borders, the constant teleporting was quite annoying.

I do however, like your endgame of a re-scatter, and I would appreciate you trying again :) 




 it will be interesting to see who eats their apple at the start and who doesn't ':l.  




 I get DCed too, and now its white-listed! D:  




 Skype and IGN: test_subject5099
 




 Scenario?  




 As it says feel free to apply again, may I do that here? IGN: test_subject5099

 I know I'm a bit late, but it would be awesome to play, IGN: test_subject5099 




 I have been planning to be in everyone of your FFA's, and thwarted every time! 




 Twice and your out if a great idea, and if the person has tried to alternate account their way to play, the time should be extended as if it was a totally different person (A reset, if it were.).
 
























 You sir, are a genius! I think it is pretty balanced if so, because killing a witch is pretty difficult if it poisons you, and they are pretty rare. 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/ultrahardcore/comments/1kymif/news_about_xss_9/ 




 From this comments time, it is in an hour and 30 minutes. 




 23:00 UTC
 




 Its not up D: 




 Teams of -99* :P
 




 Is the message can't resolve host name or Can't Reach server? also the "(MPMG)" part is not part of the IP. 




 You messed up more than that buddy, the format is MMM DD HH:MM UTC and this is not an impromptu... 




 Well, that's how they are, yes, they do need to be nerfed, but the host cannot do that, if he decides to disable glowstone than so be it. 




 Nether is 1.6 isn't it? 




 Does it say teams or allies? No? Then no. 




 Hopefully, all went well except that the whitelist should have been cut off at the time you got twenty, and that you should have pregened. 




 YAY :D 




 Can you give us the direct IP, the one with the numbers? 




 Hopefully you can, but "trolling" doesn't give a good impression of you as a host. 




 Fun for you and whoever kills you, we would have all been killed by that one guy, thats not fun, imo, and once again, I didn't play your game... 




 Check you chat logs dude, I only ever said the F-Bomb, I never called you a cunt, the pinata thing was out of hand though, they were never a set of stuff that automatically made you win, just boosts...
 




 You can do better, but your assistant host, cannot, he has no better judgement and should have left it as an ffa, not a "kill me and you win" game, because that gear was too op. 




 It would have been fine if you used better judgement and known that the person that killed you would have won no matter what, your hosting skills can be improved on, but the pinata thing was the worst idea I've ever heard. Almost like Gammex, and that's pretty bad. I didn't get to play anyway, you banned me... 




 DO NOT EVER PLAY THIS GUYS GAMES...
Even for his first game, this is wildly unacceptable, he did not pregen or cut off the whitelist, leading to 30 minutes of trying to kick people to lower the player count. Then, the game was changed to FFA due to issues, (which is fine), however, then the host made himself "a walking pinata" with a sharp V sword and full diamond. I said that this was F-ing Stupid, and to that, he said, that this was a "random game" when infact it was a Reddit To2, not an FFA by some nitwit, even though thats what it ended up being. Do not play in this hosts games, unless you want to waste your time. 




 Swyrnd and test_subject5099 




 Hi, my name is nether rush, and I killed 4 people in 30 seconds! 




 WOO! 




 If you didn't notice, you can log in now! 




 This usually isnt how this works out, but sometimes it just doesnt work out :/ 




 Hope you do well :D 




 Practice your pvp overall, and start with an FFA, learn the basics, maybe some tactics, and listen to what some people say in chat, because while sometimes it is really annoying things that arent relevant, sometimes it is helpful. Keep the mentality too at the start of the game, that you will only have 10 hearts, and thats it.

And remember, baby zombies will eat your face, skellies have aimbot, and that the nether is over-powered. 




 Yeah, I know, I wanted to play too :/ 




 Cmon man it says the max is 30 players :/ Please tell me you didnt start early :/ 




 You already start? It was never specified when you opened and I'd like to play :( 




 Well, it says Vanilla in the title, but No mobs and Perma-day are not Vanilla :3 




 My PC doesn't work with ips of this sort, do you have the number form of the IP?
 




 nether enabled?
 




 Not the only one man, mine was the same way. 




 Please host adc, Brindle's game is home hosted...
 




 3:15 UTC is 11:15 EDT, the server opens at 11:00 EDT  




 Nether enabled this time? 




 GG, that win was a bit cheaty, but we killed so many in the portal. Thank you swyrnd for helping me win! 




 Man, you have to pregen, otherwise it will take an eternity to start the game. 




 What about the nether? Is its terrain 1.7.3 generated? 




 If I don't have potions: 1. Pick 2. Sword 3. Bow 4. Water Bucket 5. F S 6. Lava Bucket 7. Food 8. Blocks 9. Torches or Gapples

If I have potions I just remove blocks, Lava, and F S for pots and such, and my inventory itself is put accordingly to my hotbar, like arrows above bow or tools above the pick. 




 YES, my favorite gamemode! 




 Why thank you, even if i did lose, it was a completely fair final fight, but as it seems, Strength 1 vs. 10 dogs (I had the strength) is not good if you have no lava. 




 Can we get some clarification as to what is going on with this tournament, because it seems like game 2 is not happening without any reason why. 




 Unfortunately I cannot make this particular match, but all other matches in this tournament I should be able to make :) 




 I would not recommend playing this host's games, very early in the match he started an event that caused rain to do damage, with no notification on this post that that would happen. When anyone would say anything about this, he would reply "quit yo bitchin" completely disregarding anything said. Do not play a game from this host if you wish to pvp, and not hide in caves from an event we were not notified of. 




 Should be open, Its 10 minutes before start... 




 This opens in 45 minutes from when I replied to you... 




 Yeah, it should be open, but its not... 




 Why hello there, I'm test_subject5099 (I prefer JT personally), and I've been around since May 2013. I personally love the competition, and play a lot of  FFAs, but team games are always fun (I prefer random teams games over chosen, but that's just me.). Always have fun, and remember, pots are op, and enchantments first!  




 For future reference: 4:30 UTC is actually 12:30 EDT 




 Is there a chance you would allow solos? 




 Better hope that skeleton is on the left or right side of your screen! 




 When does it open?
 




 We over at /r/ultrahardcore have a very similar idea, where we have the "Golden Head". Simply craft a golden apple but instead of the apple use a player head and heal 4 hearts! This encourages pvp and gives strategy to how much gold you should keep on your person. 




 Yeah, got second :( what is your IGN anyway?
 




 hopefully I won't die with potions this time! 




 Don't worry, I died with pots yesterday, so you should definitely be able to kill me :) 




 I will murder you all 3 




 ICEEEEEEEEEEEEE, I totally will play this :)

 




 Yes
 
























 The ability to turn all sounds except player sounds may or may not effect UHC, probably will be fine due to the fact that all people have access to it in vanilla at any time, and it is intended, but idk. 




 TBH, with their rarity, it seems fine, if you get that lucky to get one of these books, or spend the time to, then its about as balanced as spawning next to a temple, not game ending, but good. Considering too the drop of books in dungeons, it seems okay. 




 No more endurance?
 




 This is not the way to format posts, the correct format is MMM DD HH:MM UTC - (Title) and you must use UTC time. 




 test_subject5099 




 You sir, should just stop posting matches, this is ridiculous.
  




 Isn't Blitz FFA you start at half a heart but you have a notch apple? 




 I would move to a much more convenient position to bow fight, hopefully catching the attacker off-guard and shooting him to death. 




 I have to thank you for that, while it wasn't directly my intent, you gave the chat a more of a wake up call then myself alone could have. 




 The UHCS skype chat, as I understand it, is for us to socialize, and it has been that way for a while, but or some reason lately it is filled with uninteresting, stupid guff that most people don't want to read or care about. Myself and many others have left the chat for this reason, where we were mostly there for information about the server, the occasional conversation was fine, but it had gotten out of hand.

A long time ago when the server was smaller and there were way less people, me and MG had a very long conversation about random stuff, that we were promptly told by many to stop, which we did, and talked in a private chat.

What I'm asking is to stop all this random stuff on the chat, and bring it back to its original purpose, the way it should be and was meant to be, not some role-playing chat with random topics that mean nothing to the chat. This is a plea for order, for the way things should be, not a spam-filled chat with things you can do elsewhere. 




 I didnt say it wasn't :P just that he said call, but calls are not permitted. 




 *cough* skype is not allowed *cough* only teamspeak *cough cough* 




 basically, teamspeak would be incredibly easier because you can just switch channels. 




 The Title format MMM DD HH:MM UTC - Title and the time must be on a 24 hour clock, and the post must be made at least one hour in advance. 




 The Title format MMM DD HH:MM UTC - Title and the time must be on a 24 hour clock

 So you said you will open at 21:30, but you opened 5 minutes before that... Why?

 This post is still here though...
 




 Hey, could you remember to close your server or put up the whitelist next time, your spawn is a bit screwed up. 




 GAH 




 You could literally make an alliance of the entire server. 




 cough cough, You need to turn off whitelist, cough cough 




 97 Coal Blocks and 221 Redstone Blocks 




 First of all, your title should be in the format of MMM DD HH:MM UTC - (Information), Secondly, you should be using UTC time, not GMT, which are the same, but UTC is used here. Thirdly, the only information you have is the gametype, time, and the nether, no subrules or other paraphernalia. Please look at other posts and follow the format next time. Also, you cannot post a match less than an hour before the actual match.

 Wait, what? 




 THE VERY FIRST GAME THAT THE NETHER IS BACK, YOU HOST AT A TIME I CAN'T PLAY. WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY 




 :/ 




 woo
 




 Damn guy punted me off a mountain for it though :D 




 Okay, I see, I see, I am aware too that for some reason your name was not there before, but congrats on freedom. 




 Allies cannot win together, they must kill in the end. 




 You are still on the UBL Slutty, Number 10. 




 Resource packs in general work fine with optifine, why wouldn't an xray one work? Just common logic... 




 ;_; 




 not that I'm trying to condone this or anything, or attack you, but there are xray texture packs too, which are obviously bannable, but they work with optifine...

DON'T DO IT KIDS, not even once... 




 You hosted my very first ever game, I am so sad to see you go :(
Hopefully you will do well in life, and I hope nothing horrible caused this.
...see you next time :) 




 test_subject5099, Swyrnd, Jaewoook 




 server not up? 




 because the game is tomorrow... -_- 




 Match posts must be made one hour or more in advance... 




 Not to be mean, but don't forget, if you're on the UBL, you also cannot be on the server. 




 Click the link... 




 :') I'm sure we will all miss you del, have a great time at college, the dragon rush I played with you was one of the most memorable games I ever played, and UHCS was (and is) a big deal to me :) good luck out there!

...and come back for a visit...ya hear? 




 This is true ^^^^ 




 ._. 




 No, log on at any time to play. 




 I wouldn't assume solos are allowed, are they? 




 Since this is the only activity this account has also ever had on reddit, this is almost certainly not true. Hooray for logic! 




 I win 




 Well, then allow me to go for round 3 :D 




 I posted this after the match was full, I posted it for people that didn't get into this match but still wanted to get in, but that's fine, I hate fun too. 




 You disable glowie yet? 




 Anyone that would still like to play a uhc, there is a voted match at uhc.msarchet.com:25618 




 It filled in half a second. 
























 test_subject5099
 




 It is the correct format, probably can't be parsed because it goes into next year. 




 The plugin, being from /r/ultrahardcore, I feel that the plugin is 100x better, for no ghast tears, enderpearl damage can be toggled, player heads, golden heads; with all of this, I feel makes the game a lot better and more strategic. 




 The overall format is Mmm DD HH:MM UTC - (Title) 




 The correct format for this match is Oct 06 01:30 UTC - Cheesy's #3 To3 




 Sep removes them from extreme hills and chests.

 Thanks Obama 




 I wish more kills to you, and death upon you at the same time :D 




 Next time, your post must be at least an hour in advance. 




 Whitelist isn't off.
 




 probably
 




 The correct format for this particular match is "Sep 30 18:00 UTC - dannyminez's #3 To3 Endurance (Sign Up)"
 




 test_subject5099 




 I did then lol 




 Walden, matches cannot be posted less than an hour in advance. Do not be surprised if this is taken down.  




 I was in the game :L 




 Then don't, but we really don't either. 




 He made the best out of a bad situation :D 




 Listen D4, your post is going to be removed because only mods can post goodbyes. Sorry to see you go, but rules are rules. 




 To add to this, this was 2 hours ago. However, being that it doesn't say impromptu, as much as I want it to be today, is probably tomorrow. 




 The civilization crumbles, and you walk quietly back in, and we all listen, all of us, in spirit.  




 Maybe the one that isn't an asshole.
 




 "isn't" 




 Then that is not an allies game, thats a long distance to2 with solos. 




 You can always backstab in an allies game. 




 I can't get the ip to work, can you supply the number ip? 




 Incorrect formatting, the correct format for this match is Sep 24 00:45 UTC - Awalk's To2 w/solos 




 and maybe test_subject5099?

 Sep 22 16:00 UTC - MCRuler10 #1, FFA (Return of Funk)***
I only assume its today. 




 Sep 22 07:00 UTC - FFA - Big Toe's Impromptu #12* :P 




 RTo5 means random teams of five, so there is no guarantee you can play with your friend. 




 Sep 22 09:00 UTC - * 




 When sessions go up everyone jumps like this and it DDOSes the servers so they time out again. 




 No golden apples or heads? 




 Sup 




 Yes, but on an even higher level, where one enters the nether or things of that nature, especially with things like enderrush. I played a few of those games though, and sometimes it helped me get gold or diamonds I wouldn't normally see right away. 




 You are able to toggle it in default minecraft I believe, but I would like to see scenarios using this functionality.  




 and a hyphen :P 




 "Date and Time: Sunday, September 16 02:00 UTC (09:00 PM EST)" 02:00 UTC is 10 EDT :P
 




 Also, how many allies? 




 Guy, the format you want to use for this particular match would be: Sep 16 20:00 UTC - DIg224#1 Vanilla FFA with Allies 




 The correct format is Mmm DD HH:MM UTC - (Title) 




 Is it FFA or To3?, it says To3 in the post. 




 I got pots (which yes, can make this completely invalid, but it was still pretty cool) and I went to 0,0 with 30 minutes left in the game, then, I see a guy, do a typical st2 2 shot, then it gets interesting. I see another guy in the desert, 2 shot him, see 2 more in the distance, run up and kill them both, turn around and kill another, and then go down into a temple to re-brew and heal. All this took less than a minute. As it turned out, there was enough diamonds left on the ground for full diamond, but I couldn't pick them up. :D (I won after 2 more kills if you didnt guess) 




 Once again, please use the correct format: Mmm DD HH:MM UTC(space)-(space)(title) 




 Announcement flair is for moderators only. 




 The format is UTC(SPACE)-(SPACE)(Title) :P xD, definitely don't delete and repost, just remember for next time. 




 As long as you know the rules, its not a problem. 




 I mean, at least the impromptus would follow the rules, they werent even posted an hour in advance. 




 See here - http://www.reddit.com/r/ultrahardcore/comments/1k53na/regarding_impromptu_and_official_matches/

No need for a mod to message you, it is against the rules, pushing your game back 15 minutes would suffice, but rules are rules, and while there may be enough players for all three, many time there are not, so please follow the rules. 




 While it is true that he does host everyday, and hosting an FFA at the same time, there should still be players, then there is no problem with holding the FFA back 15 minutes for people that want to play that, correct? Rules are Rules, even if they dont matter at one point, they do at another. 




 Games must be posted at least an hour in advance, no earlier. 




 Games must be posted at least an hour in advance, no earlier, and the correct format is MMM DD HH:MM UTC - (title) 




 Please use the correct format, the format is MMM DD HH:MM UTC - (title), and you may want to add some additional information, such as the nether, length of the game, and number of people.  




 The game that prompted crimson to write this was an ffa with one ally, and no backstabbing, to give some context, long distance to2 is basically that, in its entirety, for one change and one only, no teleport. 




 "Long Distance" To2 with solos and FFA with allies of 1 and no backstabbing are the exact same thing, infact, I've seen some hosts tp allies together before, there has to be a set description for these scenarios, it seems just too common that the two blend together. 




 1: No, I cannot record.
2. Anytime on the weekends or anything from 18:30 - 02:30 UTC
3. Teams, but only due to my inability to record, teaming with players who can would be beneficial. 




 Do you have an alternate ip? I cannot resolve the hostname due to the type of ip this is. 
























 Mine's 16, and I'm the second ranger, what do you want from me? 




 For my own input...

Wolves do not require regen unless you lower their durability, because they are able to 3 shot any dwarf outside, and if they can't be set back by low health, then they will absolutely destroy.

I can see skeletons taking more than one hit, don't get me wrong, but to give skeletons infinite arrows, does two bad things, allows hackers to use auto fire, and gives no hindrance to skeleton assaults, they can just continually push uncontested.

Creepers should not take more than one bow shot, they deal 7 hearts of damage up to 4 blocks away, 3 creepers can destroy a wall, and they can move rather quickly. Super Creepers should NEVER take more than one shot, if they are 4 blocks away from a dwarf under or on equal footing as him, it will just kill the dwarf 99% of the time. 

The digging zombie has enough pick to get through one wall, that is quite enough if you ask me. Really Digging zombies are near useless, since going through a wall doesn't do anything much, so really I think they should be removed.

Spider Kings, afaik, are being removed, and if they aren't, they can take you to half a heart in 20 seconds.

Spiderlings, they have a high maneuverability, so they should be able to dodge hits, not take them. I don't contest higher poison if the spider king is removed, but if it's not, spiderlings can take you to half a heart in 35 seconds, and every time you heal, you delay your mana regen. 




 On Bruce's Gym, the format for the website was nearly the same, and what was on that tab was a server-wide Quest to slay 1,000,000 zombies. I would assume on PMC, the logistics would be the same, and it would be a server wide quest covering some or many of the gamemodes of the server.  




 hopefully as a result, we will get more fictional heroes, that would be awesome, maybe even something like my ShepherdOfFire, but that is tooting my own horn :L 




 mhm, makes me sad :(  




 I do not know myself, I have never seen anything to indicate this, and if it's true, I'm sad I'll never get to be Guude, or have a second change at a one shot bow again :( 




 What other explanation do you need? :P 




 Some cool ideas I had to heroes abilities were like, for instance, Lance's axe would do a ton of damage, and swing really slowly, but when he procs, the mining fatigue becomes haste, and swings incredibly quickly. I had two entire ideas about heroes, because that is what I like to do when I'm bored :L. But I couldn't really tell you who I think would make a good hero, since my ideas are more along the lines of Lance. 




 To elaborate on who all the old heroes were: BruceWillakers, LanceWillakers, GoldfounderPause, CaptainBoulderFist, NisovinsIllusion, Deadbones, LadyKedemonia, and RoaminThePaladin.

* BruceWillakers had possession of Virendra, a bow with Punch 10 and one shotted all monsters except golems, and Excaliju, a weapon with greatly increased damage and proc time.
* LanceWillakers did not have a special weapon, but it is speculated that he will get his (axe?) that he uses in Death Fears Me.
* Pause had a bow that one shots all mobs, like Virendra.
* Guude had Frostshock, which I believe was a chain lightning weapon.
* Nisovin had the Tinder Flame, which was meant to do splash damage, when hitting a mob, but was never completed/fixed, and the Wriggly Wrench, that acted as a melee weapon, and when used on another dwarf, repaired all his armor.
* Deadbones, as you may have guessed, had his EZFIX SLABS, which placed a large temporary wall in front of himself and could also remotely place blocks.
* Lady Kedemonia had the Regrowth Star, which could remotely heal dwarves, and death grip monsters, pulling them to her.
* Roamin had the Holy Purifier. It's a flamethrower.

 The problem with the enderman is that its character model is 3 high, however, because a player model is 2 high, arrows would bounce off its head. DvZ used to use wither skeletons instead of normal ones, but this was changed for that very reason, the character model just didn't work. 




 Thanks for the geegees Ageegee, maybe see you soon sometime, have fun, and good luck. 




 The "Death Zone" has a bit of leverage, it isn't like the instant you pass it you die, it's maybe like a 20 - 30 block range. 




 To add onto the updates of last night, some minor tweaks and changes were made to the game, and one big one:

* Invulnerability has been reduced (10 seconds)
* Creepers **do not** receive invulnerability.
* Wood working has been redone: 1. Torches take significantly longer to make. 2. All wood products are **transmuted one to one** (I.E. One plank = one stick **except in the case of sticks to bowls, which is still one to four**). 3. When a bowl is used in oil, it will produce 4 mortar.
* The only ~~map~~ **maps** at this moment are Mount Willakers, Oasis, and Dogekac as the other maps need to be changed to accommodate multiple shrines. 
* **Multiple shrines have been added:** Instead of one shrine, there are several, which must be captured **in order** (1st, 2nd, 3rd) for the monsters to win. It seems to take **less time to capture** each of these points, and once one is captured, the **monster spawn is moved on to or close to it.**
* A monster **cannot** pass the shrine currently being attacked, else it is struck by lightning, and dies. **I'm unsure on this, but this seems to have broken the "Infection" plague, because the instant the infected turn, they die to the shrine's fail safe.**
* **All maps** now has starting supplies, of about 20 - 40 of mortar, cobble, and torches.
* At least from what I could tell, past shrine 2, monsters that turn into Super Creepers will do so on the spot.

I figured I would write another one of these to go into detail of the changes, but if Rob and Nis would like me to remove/stop these in favor of the Trello list system, I gladly will if they ask. 

* Link to the Trello here: https://trello.com/b/Wi2Di0qF/playmindcrack 

More features, yay! 

* Oasis returns with 2 shrines.
* Dogekac has 4 shrines. 




 Nis actually does not have two items, his bow, the Tinder Flame, does no extra damage, and was originally meant to be AoE, but never was implemented that way. 




 If you look to the Changes thing Rob posted, it's actually a complete change of flow, as seen by the "multiple shrines" card. You can't really have squid when the shrine is outside right infront of you, kinda defeats the purpose. 




 They have been removed due to a new upcoming feature, that I will post about when it is fully instated. 




 I had the purifier in it's overpowered version, and my god, it made zombies melt into it, can't wait to see it return. 




 Thanks Juhdas :P 




 I always liked being Nis, and when I was Nis with Virendra, that was heaven. I in general just like class stuff, I could eat that stuff up all day. 




 So many people won't ever know the satisfaction of killing a dwarf, as a squid xD. 




 I myself do not play as monster that often, but do the golems spawn with their picks? If they do not, then they do not do any more damage than one heart, which is unfortunate. 




 Nisovin, as I stated above, Holy Blades do not do 10 damage, and still do 8. Thanks for the clarification though! :D 




 eh, maybe, I would totally do it for the Hero update though, love that stuff. 




 So, as you may know, DvZ is still a WIP, as heroes are not finished, sounds still need to be added, and new maps are still needed. However, there was another "balancement" update rather than "content" update today, and these are the changes I observed:

* Procs are now limited to within 5 blocks of your person, so basically, **bow proccing is removed.**
* Golems are readded, ~~however, spawn with only a seppuku, so they do not have much of a function other than a walking damage soaker.~~ **They now spawn once again with the ancient pick.**
* **Healing ale now uses 150 mana** rather than 200 from before.
* Mount Willakers has invulnerability added upon monster spawn (18 seconds).
* As of this moment, ~~I did not see any instances of squid (maybe rarer?)~~, ~~wolves (also rarer?)~~, ~~or the map oasis (removed?)~~ ~~and have not played on any map other than Mt Willy to see if they have arrow invul too~~.
* ~~WE GOT FANCY SPECIAL MONSTER MESSAGES, I LOVE YOU ALL.~~ **SPIDER KING MESSAGES ARE MESSED UP, PRAISE REDACTED.**

I myself enjoy these changes, it makes indoor combat easier, shields have more use outside, and spawn camping isn't devastating anymore, at least from what I observed.

As stated by nisovin below: 

* **Sword damage was increased to 10** rather than 8 (~~**PALADINS, USE THE RUNEBLADE, THE HOLY BLADE IS NOT UPDATED**~~ Fixed.).
* All map's invulnerability was increased (18 seconds).
* Squids are, in fact, removed.
* Oasis, is in fact, removed.
* Holy Blades and Longbows are shiny again, keep in mind they **DO NOT** do anything extra, just shine.

In a speculation: (as per substitutemyown): An event, rather it be randomly occurring (most likely this, as if it were a special monster event almost) or admin controlled, that occurs during the day known as the Solar Eclipse will block out the sun, and cause havoc among the dwarves, as the zombies regain their buff.

Side note, I would gladly make more of these if people want, it's kinda fun, always pondered the idea of a constantly changing guide, maybe one day... :P 




 No no, the kills recorded fine, the time the game took did not, which is why my longest game is still about 1:20 and not 1:40 :P 




 My *longest* and *highest total* kills game was a game on Mount Willakers in which SlyiceT100 was Bruce, and the game went on for about an hour and 40 minutes, reached 2700 kills, and didn't even record on my stat page, because I was last to die. However, my *best* game was one that only reached about 1200, but 450 were my hand as Bruce, on Mt Willy. And my most memorable game? I was nisovin....with Virendra, Bruce's bow, the props of a ranger 3 (also, do note, all of these are on the gym :P) 




 Heroes, if there is one thing I want to see, it is demonstration of hero abilities. As well as showing what is more effective at killing mobs, aka no mazes. The basics too, of course, so people don't think procs are hacks and to show bow procs are allowed :L 




 Who plays as monster?

But in all seriousness, I love to be anything that isn't a spider or digging zombie, due to them having the least lethality. 




 it's you're, can't, kyle's, and all your "i"s should be "I"s 




 Maybe I can stop by and say hi :P
 




 It takes a lot to hold up the 4th place title, but maybe sometime I'll stop by. :P 




 That's because I haven't been in one in ages. I've been in another community, and its nice there. Didn't think anyone actually missed me. 




 huh, weird, Its been a long time I guess, not as long as sk8, but a while. 




 ,. 




 I'm not missed either, no worries :P 




 Even if this is lag, a video from Scorpion is going to be posted soon enough of this guy on ttaylorr's, of him literally flying around. 




 Infinite* 




 I love it 




 :3 




 No one even knows me :P 




 I wish I had any. :( 




 Ultra Hardcore, no crafting table usage, and hardcore mode. There is a challenge.

 PA, 6:33 P.M. 




 not much, playing games. listening to music, doing (procrastinating) homework. 




 What's up? 




 Hi o/ 




 Gifted have and A, Math have an A, Spanish have an A, Web Page Design have an A, I'm really not that interesting :P 




 A few years ago we had like 5 of these in our own school a year, it was just bad, luckily they solved the problem, but those idiots took away some of our freedom in the mornings. 




 Shepherd of Fire - Avenged Sevenfold 




 The letter Q 




 Maybe the Back to the Future Trilogy? 




 Rouge - From the Dust or Shepherd of Fire - Avenged Sevenfold, been stuck between the two. 




 Literally anything I listen to I could listen to over and over as long as I initially liked it. It's almost a curse really, I will listen to some monstercat or Avenged Sevenfold and won't listen to anything else for weeks, the flip to the other and have to dig up songs out of my Youtube favorites if I want to listen to them. 




 Check to see if someone logging on has a name longer than 16 characters.  




 There is no need to lower the slot number, someone nicknamed themself over the character limit, just disable /nick. Probably want to clear the player files too, if that guy joins back with the nick he will crash it again.  




 He does :P 




 OMG this is amazing, wonder if you could do that in a game, guess you would need a resource pack for it, but on the DvZ server they have it when you level up a thing flashes on your screen, so maybe its possible. 
























 * ~~Bows in DvZ are not using spell damage, so they're just glorified vanilla minecraft bows, and don't do any real damage.~~
* ~~Roamin is spawned as the Default hero, instead of Bruce.~~
* Armor takes more than one durability per hit from zombies.
* Dwarven Runeblades use the Lightbringer Textures.
* and btw, 30 Dwarf games are still a thing, why? 




 :L I'm just passing by. 




 Throughout time this happens quite a bit, UltraSoftcore had its time, Mystery teams had its time, and right now Cutclean has its. This happens all the time, it will go away eventually.
 




 15 soon 16 




 The server isn't full, why can't I join? :/
 




 possibly whitelist me? IGN: test_subject5099
 




 make sure you are not using 1.7.9 




 As far as I know, this isn't true, what actually happens basically, is if you hit a mob, then hit it twice more, you can 3 shot it, however, if you hit that mob twice, another person must hit it 3 times, because your shots did not hit 3 times in a row to kill it. 




 Disabling gapples and gheads for this could make it even better :P 




 Can't forget MotherNature, or the other one off events like the RiddleMaster or other such events :P 




 Personally I don't even have fun surviving.
 




 and I know that you know this, I'm saying your request isn't really going to be fulfilled, because it's going to be completely overhauled soon anyway :P 




 if you look at the greeting messages, it is not actually out of beta. Power Juice in its current form will never be out of beta, only the upcoming arcade version will be "out of beta". 




 I'm sure when the next update comes, and Power Juice is changed to an Arcade game, then it will be available for all, and the server will no longer be in beta. 




 I've always perceived this rule as: if you are purposely doing something to inhibit anyone's game on purpose, this is bannable, such as putting a roof over someone's head or digging them into the quarry. If it is done as an accident, and they are unaware of the bad their actions cause, I don't think this is bannable. This is my interpretation of the rule, I'm sure others have their own. 




 there won't be another KGM update, as you can see [here](https://trello.com/c/FPXkf3cW/87-wizard-school-tournament) and [here](https://trello.com/c/Dbgnb2OZ/89-classic-golden-monocle). This is because the entire gamemode is being overhauled, and will be completely different. KGM will no longer have leaderboards or titles, but will instead be transferred to WZT or Wizard School Tournament. 




 You killed that player before, and he must have suicided at some point, so you were credited with the kill, even as a zombie. 




 You are mistaken, the one in red is ry1234567 before he changed it to black, the one in the penguin suit is deathbot. What I think is funny is they're not even trying to get the LightBringer, that sword there is Excaliju, Bruce's sword. 




 and Deathbot  




 DeathSeekerJT, part of the DeathSeeker lineage, those who can use the silver blade of Orion, one of the most powerful swords ever created, blinding monsters with it's glint. Only one DeathSeeker can live at a time, and for millennia one family held the DeathSeeker title, until their last heir died and Orion keep. JT was sent to find the sword, and in the process of escaping the keep, found the blade could be used in his hand, becoming the DeathSeeker. (Also has Brenna, a bow acclaimed for it's explosive power, not as cool a story as Orion :P) 




 To take a quote from rob himself, "The masses don't know what they want."
 




 it's been a long time, but i'd love to be in it! :D test_subject5099

 Precisely the reason I left that game.

 3 Thank you :D  




 Me and Yetii were wondering if you do one of her, could you possibly put both of us in it? If it isn't that much of a hassle. :S I don't mean to sound demanding, I love the art, we were just wondering :P 




 They do get damage immunity, however, because their death is by a spell, they can be "tagged" by a player, and when they blow up it registers as a kill. This works for all mobs that die a suicide type of death, like Seppukus. so it appears like they have no immunity if you just looked at kill feeds, but they do have it. 




 ry of the gym beta never forget. 




 Check Rob's twitter, it's there somewhere. 




 I won anyway ^^
 




 Salogel is a part of the cats, and we do not participate in such activities. - JT of the Cats 




 They always tell me to get a room  




 There's a difference between a real argument, as you explained, and a role play argument, as wolfboy explained. 




 Void, if you fall in you just get teleported back to spawn. 




 It's not. 









 You won't be getting that helmet back. 




 And for this, they risk getting banned. This is an exploit, and it is bannable. Warn them, or don't, but they can be banned for having two sets. 




 fixed. Saw some myself, just was took a bit to change it. 




 The protection is not as intrusive now that the creepers you are shooting don't have invulnerability, and the mobs don't drop right on your head, so it isn't as difficult to not walk into the zone. This area technically is still farther than it was when the protection was first introduced, but less than when Nis moved it back.
 




 No, what it means that you can't throw armor, you can't be rearmored ever. You will always have armor in your inventory, unless it all breaks, so you can't be rearmored. RNG is Random Number Generator, how a lot of games make things random. 




 As I stated above, I mean the Diamond armor, any piece. 




 I mean your full set of diamond armor, if you throw it out of your inventory, any piece, it will teleport back into your inventory. Be sure to click around your inventory to find it, and if it doesn't appear, it can take a while to appear. 




 After several Test games run by Nisovin, a very small update was rolled out to Dogekac and Daragor, plus a removal of a certain mob.

* **Dogekac** was known for having a large amount of **holes in the bedrock** to bypass certain areas, such as at the front of the keep, there being holes under the lights, straight to the Inner Shrine. **These holes are now filled in.**
* Speaking of **Inner Shrine**...It **was removed**, there are now two shrines. The Bridge Shrine, and the Final Shrine.
* **Daragor's mob spawn was pushed back**, the tools tables were moved slightly over, and many trees were added abouts the front. The **mob protection is slightly forward**, to about **4 or so blocks infront of the shovel table.**
* ~~Unless the RNG was being very harsh to the **Spider Kings** in the games I played, they are **removed.**~~  *Saw some in a Dogekac game, JT is wroooooooooooooooooooong.*
* **Armor is not throwable anymore**, it will teleport back into your inventory.  ~~This means you CANNOT be rearmored.~~ *Unless, of course, all of your armor breaks.*


* You can now be rearmored if you are missing a piece of your armor, such as a helmet, and it will be re-equipped. No need to drop all your armor anymore. (Thanks Nis!)
 




 My setup:

1. Pot 2. Sword 3. Bow 4. Pot 5. Shield 6. Pick 7. Cobble 8. Glue 9. Torches

The reason I use two pots is because when I played on the UHC reddit, I liked to have pick, sword, bow. So I was never accustom to changing that system and using hotkeys, so I prefer to keep my bow and sword together.  




 Yes! someone else that uses two potions :D 




 Oasis is out of the rotation, and has no indication of returning. 




 Something that I had heard, is that Nohdalag would eventually get flame as an attribute, which doesn't do anything because zombies have fire resistance, but it would look pretty cool. I know this was a planned thing, but never actually put in place. 




 Another Hero idea I had was the ShepherdofFire, a hero that has the Staff of Hellfire, that creates lanes of flame around its target, just to look cool. He also spawns with 5ish one use items, that are very overpowered, but hurt the dwarves too, such as killing all the monsters at once, but also killing a few dwarves, or giving every dwarf a 30 second proc, but unarmoring half the dwarves too. The Shepherd of Fire may have 10 items that he CAN spawn with, but may only relieve 5 or so, making every Shepherd unique. 




 DeathSeekerJT: Uses his own bow, Brenna, a one shot bow that causes the explosion animation and if it hits a block, breaks it. He uses Orion, the silver blade, that deals more damage than a runeblade but not as much as Excaliju, and when it procs, produces large amounts of fireworks that blind the monsters (this may or may not work, depending on if it crashes players or not). Orion is passed down by DeathSeeker lineage, and only one that uses the blade, can have that title, and only one DeathSeeker can exist at one time. 




 That was my idea too D:

 




 This change was today, the 27th, and not yesterday, the 26th. 




 More balancement changes, and reintroduction of an old map.

* Daragor has been readded, using the multiple shrine system, has 3 shrines: the Gate Shrine, the Juice Shrine, and the Final Shrine, each on a layer of the map.
* Armor, when repaired, gives 160 durability per repair, rather than 100 from before.
* When dropped, an armor piece ends up in oblivion, and is gone forever. (Remember, if you require a new set, throw away ALL of your old set.)
* Mount Willakers' shrines were reduced to two: the Courtyard Shrine behind the front wall, and the Final Shrine.
* Each map has a monster spawn debuff/protection, that deals a dwarf nausea and a bit of poison if within the radius. (This has the unfortunate effect of blocking dwarves from the cave on Dogekac, unsure if intentional or not.) The debuff is the same amount of nausea, but the poison starts as a very low amount, and then after about 5 seconds, becomes poison III.
* Dogekac's lobby is no longer destructable.
* **As of the 27th,** Dogekac's shrines were changed as well, to 3 shrines: Bridge, Inner, Final. **THIS IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE** 




 Meh, not for me, but personal thoughts I guess 




 Lost my Pegasus Boots, great day yesterday. :/ 




 The Exact Opposite way JT would be, hooray! 




 Thing is, I would agree if the walls weren't literally behind the shrine you need to take, so once you get through, you die to the shrine field. Maybe with the new shrine placement they will be more useful, but atm, they aren't that good. 




 When the pigs fly and we all spawn with Excaliju, only then. :P 




 Your last point would be extremely cruel, because we just want to play games like anyone else, that's why titles don't have  more powerful weapons (with the exception of the Staff, dealing an extra half heart) so I see no reason why we should be hindered, just because we are titled. There are plenty of people without titles that are better than me, and they wouldn't be hindered. Also, I see no reason to nerf procs, and rob has mentioned before, he will not do any rebalancing until after heroes are reintroduced, but I think procs are fine, in my opinion. 
























 With the Departure of Nisovin and Rob, I will be following and supporting them like I did when I first joined PlayMindcrack. I hope the best for Guude, and I hope that maybe he can do something to keep his server alive too, but at it's core, Nisovin and Rob were PMC, they were the games, and they were AT LEAST half the community, and I will stick by their side, as I have from the start. 




 Well, KGM is under Rob's jurisdiction as well, so I see that going with him, as well as WAT, I presume. Camelot I'm not sure who that's under, as well as RoC and PJT. 




 Noosa - Walk on by (SR   RNG Remix) 




 good job :L
 




 Mexican posted before you, you cannot host at this time without proof of permission. 




 Whitelist will be off at :45, for those that are waiting. 




 Not the time, nor the place, there's another thread you could just have easily said this, and if what rebexer said is true, then you should be less of a hypocrite. 




 Time to go, although, while being known for what you do is nice and all, I wasn't known at all on the gym until I became 10th on the leaderboard, that's when I go noticed. However, even if getting noticed is a good thing to come from the boards, they do so much more damage than good to me, and others, so it seems. The board should be removed, that's my opinion. 




 Honestly, although matt is in a case of ban evasion, he was only banned for bad fellowship, and so he himself is not cheating, and all his kills are legit, as one person, as much as he can play. FWP is not one person, can play any maximum of its time its members are on, and while there isn't modded clients in use as far as we know, and play time is not a bannable by any means, it seems very unsportsman-like to use one single account just for the purpose of bringing someone who got all his kills as one person, fairly, down, just on account of his past ban that doesn't have anything to do with his ability to kill.

tl;dr, Op got his kills as one person, fairly, it's unsportsmanlike to use a group on one account to do the same. 




 Sadly, I would not put it past some people that were once or still are in the community to do these things. Some groups are maliciously toxic, while others are very very nice. The thing is, those that are toxic are sometimes the popular ones, and they are part of the reason I am no longer playing on the server. My situation, as well as another friend of mine's are very similar to your's in terms of falling into a depression. I do not attribute these people alone as the cause of this, but I do site them as partial reason, as well as the boards, and other goings on in my life. It makes me very sad to see a community fall into something like this, but I am happy that someone brought it to light, something I couldn't do. 




 And our top Paladin being a bunch of people on one account is any better? it feels wrong to the community to do that. 




 While I have a personal bias due to people being rude to me in a similar manner, the *penguins* as it were, are known to share many alt accounts. While this on its own is not really against the rules, it is a relatively common occurrence.  




 THAT. IS. PERFECT. I love it :D:D:D:D:D

 says on "blacklist of items" at the bottom
 




 if all the dwarves were in the shrine, that be fine, but if not, you killed all the dwarves that needed to get back in to repair or regen mana or whatnot. 




 He wasn't wrong, blocking off does kill dwarves. You would need more of an explanation to actually be able to convey your point.
 




 Did you actually read the post? It says it right on Team size.
 




 It was 1.5x gold, just a little edit. 




 I miss short games 




 nono, you are correct, they dont show up until those 5 are exausted 




 and patrons do not get double, they get 1.5x 




 FBI's game was posted first 




 I don't enjoy the indoors anymore, but I used to, now it's just about who has the most slabs and the most wrenches, it's not about tunnels anymore. Tunnels are pointless anymore 




 Honestly I have more fun with short and quick games, these new hour and a half long games are basically the reason I quit, they give me such a bad headache.

PS: Why is this downvoted? are you serious? It was a statement, my god.

PSS: This community is so broken now, all these downvotes on Mae's statements even though he is just trying to show his point, quite sad guys. People have opinions, they aren't necessarily wrong, and he has no reason to be downvoted. 




 Longer and more kills does not necessarily mean more fun. 




 It's unfortunate this is so downvoted, as you seem to have the same problems with the game now as I do, and it is the reason I have quit.

edit: lol, ironically being downvoted for a statement about downvoting. 




 Could I join?
 




 May I ask what IrishBrawler (on the 2nd to last picture) is saying, what's that supposed to mean? of course, only if you know, by chance. 




 You all think this is a joke, it's not. 




 The special weapons do not give any bonus damage or any other buff, they merely have a different name and shine.
 




 Hasn't gotten any better really. 




 The boards to me have done so much more damage then ingame, and I want them gone so badly. 




  Milky Way
 




  Server Info: this server is a 4GB server hosted in PA, USA, North America, Earth, Milky Way.

But which Universe and Dimension?
 




 but it has nothing to do with what's happened in game, people just focus others based on personal grudges.  




 I myself lost the whole team feeling when people started to form their own little groups and hold certain people up higher than others. It makes people not in these groups plain feel like crap as they're not included and sometimes discriminated against. Can't say you feel like you're on a team when someone on that team punches out your torches because they don't like you, or let their friends that are mobs just focus you all game.

 No, the upgrade was removed because the armor system is going to be revamped. 




 test_subject5099 




 Still think my hero idea for the ShepherdofFire from the link TetrixxYT has below would fit into the DvZverse nicely.
 




 You can actually make these yourself, simply going into your server textures file, changing the playmindcrack one into the same format as a resource pack, and then replacing the files from the resource pack of choice with the playmindcrack ones with the items you wish to change. 




 Magma Cream Represent!
 




 Alpha Gym Represent!
 




 You may think PlayMindcrack is unlikely to go down, but it's predecessor, Bruce's Gym, which used the same systems and had a lot of fans too, could not operate due to the low amount of donations, and was abandoned. Donators are more likely to donate if they have incentive, even if that incentive is only silly and fun. Getting nothing doesn't bode well for servers, and it won't. 




 What happens when you have servers like PlayMindcrack, that is coded and run by someone with a loyal fanbase, that wont work anywhere else, because they actually own the rights to a lot of the minigames? These servers are run for hundreds of dollars, you can't expect one man with all that money to all of a sudden run a server. 




 People already do.
