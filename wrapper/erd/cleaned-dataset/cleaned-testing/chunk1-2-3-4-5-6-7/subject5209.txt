 I know it's stupid, but [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Licked_Hand) has changed the way I live my life (albeit in a very small way).
      

At night, my cat always props up on the side of the bed to bump his head against/lick my hand before jumping on the bed.  Ever since I became aware of this stupid legend, I have to turn on my phone's flashlight and shine it in his face before I am at ease.      

  
Not the way a 33-year-old, grown-ass man should be...but we all have our things, right?  Right?! 




 I've read a version of that before somewhere and let me tell you...I fucking hate it!  
  
Whenever my wife calls me from downstairs and I'm halfway down, that little thought pops into my head for some reason.  If I went towards her voice in the kitchen and then I heard her calling me from one of the upstairs rooms...I would probably shit myself right there. 




 There they are. 




 I think I have an idea of why it didn't work out. 




 Is your name Jake? 









 "...and I jizzed in my pants". 




 He choked himself on a chicken parm sandwich trying to imitate his idol, Peyton Manning.     
  
It's being ruled a suicide.  Insurance will not pay for that.  Sorry for your loss. 




 If I had that particular set of skills, I would have Butler pulling the Super Bowl trophy out of Sherman's chest.  
  
Sadly, I do not possess that ability and can only imagine it in my head.  It is glorious...and in HD!

 Technically true, but not when "fish   clits" is the first combination mentioned and "fish   chips" is the second. 




 Fish and Clits. Kinda like "fish and chips", but I wouldn't recommend ordering the former at a restaurant. 




 For me, I would have to say Super Troopers.  I wasn't expecting to see Farva's police baton.  
  
  
Edit: Should have taken out "the best" from the title, but I'll leave it.

 I came here from the same post...and found my brothers and sisters in arms. Subscribed as soon as I saw the title of the subreddit. Sad right? 




 "What do we pay you for?"

I'd hate to break it to them that all I do is surf Reddit all day unless someone can't turn on their monitor. Then I spring into action like a tiger...with no legs. 




 And that's where I live. South Cakalaka. 




 It's 55 until you reach a certain stretch of the highway, and then it drops to 45...and then back up to 55 once you leave that stretch.  For whatever reason, I have no idea. 




 Wow, I've never been that lucky.  Depending on the arresting officer, you could've been hauled away. 




 That first ticket would've been the property of the guy beside me, if I didn't have the stupid need to outrun everyone else on the road.
  
"Oh you want to be faster than me?  I DON'T THINK SO!" 




 Yeah, I was a little shocked that he would say something about my back window.  I obviously need to bone up on my tint laws in my area.  
  
I can see emergency lights just fine through all of my windows. 




 Just rear and side windows.  Nothing on the front. 




 I watched that loop for an uncomfortable amount of time...until I was comfortable with it. 




 Yeah. I think I would've been fine if I wasn't speeding. I've never been pulled over before just for dark windows and apparently I've been driving around with an expired tag for two months now with no issues. 




 15%.  I think the lowest it can be legally here is 25%. Not really sure. 




 ...within a ten minute window.

First one was 70 in a 45 on a highway. Got a ticket for that. In the same stop, I got a written warning about my expired tag and a verbal warning about my tinted windows. Gave him a "Thank you sir." and I was on my way home.

Second one was 83 in a 60 on the interstate. Got a verbal warning for that. Here's the kick...I also got a ticket for my expired tag and one for my tinted windows. I was contemplating on saying "Thank you sir, may I have another?", but I realized that would not end well for me.

Needless to say, my driving habits will be changing...along with my insurance premiums. 




 If he sent letters to all of the *owners*, I wonder who received it for the Packers. I'm guessing the top guy at Packers headquarters?

 And did she give birth in a bowling alley parking lot?  If not, I'm pretty sure that having a baby at a hospital is going to cost way more than $50. 




 Damn, I don't even like letting my *wife* hold my phone.  

Any way you can wipe it or lock it down remotely? 




 We start to slightly reposition and I attempt to slide my pants into her pants, but outside her underwear.

You kinky bastard... 




 I do this exact thing with all of my cords. Keeps it nice and neat. 




 I would let Aaron Rodgers touch my beard any time he wants, no homo.....eh, maybe a little homo.

 One character less than the "Infinity years" result gives me the result of "88 quadrillion nonagintillion years".

 One tip was the bike glitch thing...which I'm a little weary of doing. I don't want to get banned from playing online or anything over a stupid glitch. Is that possible?

Another was a single player tip to invest in the companies that Lester talks about before doing the assassinations...which I haven't done any of them yet.

And another was:
1. Make two character profiles.
2. Have one be like an "off shore" bank account.
3. Whatever money you earn with your main character, put into the bank.
4. Switch to the other character and have him withdraw it all into pocket cash.
5. Switch back to the main character, and if someone kills you, the "medical bill" doesn't get taken out of your bank account. 




 TL;DR

I'm the GTA V version of Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman...without the blowjobs and ALMOST getting raped by George Costanza.  




 On Xbox, I believe it's:

Back button  Inventory  Give Cash

I could be wrong, though.  




 50 Shades of GTA... 




 That's actually the first time in my entire life that I've used that term to say "vehicle"...and it will not be staying in my vocabulary. Didn't feel right.  




 After a survival mission, I got placed into a random session. With only me and another person in this session, I felt somewhat safe to go about my business (robbing stores, shooting random NPCs, taking pictures of bikini clad women on the beach).

Out of the blue, this guy sends me a text saying that we should team up. Being the paranoid person that this game has turned me into...I accept, but have my pistol out just in case. He rumbles up to my location in a fully modded Z Type. Seeing as I barely have $9K in the bank and haven't seen that car in game anywhere before...I was impressed.

He then proceeds to friend me, let me in his car, and then takes me to his $400K apartment. I felt like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman...only, you know...if Julia Roberts was a dude. Anyway, we get to his apartment and go into the garage, where he proceeds to show me his impressive array of whips, all modded out as well. We then spend the next 10-20 minutes, standing there just talking money strategies and general gameplay tactics. He told me a bunch of things that I didn't know and even offered to give me cash, but couldn't because the option was grayed out at the time being.

At the end of our rendezvous, he says he's going to go play CoD and to hit him up later for some general GTA fun. Right before he leaves he says, "Most people with a bounty on their head wouldn't be as trusting as you were.". At that point, I just remembered that I jacked an NPCs ride before the previous survival mission and he put a $5K bounty on my head. I had totally forgotten about it.

That was the absolute coolest experience that I've had with a random person in GTA:O! This game is awesome! 




 In the first part, after sinking the bit into the wall...why does she start making kissy faces towards the drill? 




 And she's using the same spoon to stir everything. 







































 What I meant by the proposed question was like:  
  
What if Rick died instead of Shane in the field?  What if Andrea got bitten, instead of Amy?  Carol, instead of T-Dog?  
  
They would still have the bonding over time, just as different people.
 




 Pardon the possibly bad grammar in the title - English is my first language.  Anywho...

Who would be in which role in the "new" group?  Where would they be?  Would they be a better group of hardened survivors than the group we have now? 




 Not knowing what kind of man he is, that could be a good choice...but looks can be deceiving, can't they? 




 Very well thought out and a good choice. Bravo. 




 Why? Because that's the question that I asked, mother dick. :) 




 Too soon, man.

It's a good thing my job doesn't have a revolving door entrance. I'd have a nervous breakdown as soon as I got in the middle. 




 Maybe freckledfuck can see a lot about a person just by looking at them. A hell of a lot, apparently... 
























 That gray shoe that comes in from the right at 01:56 has some serious grip.

 That's pretty fast for a reindeer. Usually they just hoof it.

 I'd like to do the same thing, but my wife doesn't like "comic movies", so I would have to do it all by me onesies.  Oy.  It sucks not having friends that are into comics and such as much as I am.

 Alexandra Daddario is the only reason I will watch this...when it comes out on Netflix in 2 years. 




 What would you do if your son was at home - crying all alone on the bedroom floor cause he's hungry - and the only way to feed him is to sleep with a man for a little bit of money?

 He was in Django Unchained? I don't remember that. 




 Actually, I just finished watching The Lazarus Effect. 









 That's why I said "probably".  Gotta cover my arse. ;)

 For me...cold weather school delays.  As a kid, that was the best news I could get in the morning while watching Bobby's World and eating strawberry poptarts.  Now as an adult, I have to make last minute plans to get my daughter to school and possibly be late to work if I have to end up taking her myself.  I can understand delays for snow and ice (I'm from SC), but today my daughter has a 2 hour delay...with dry roads, no snow, no sleet, and no ice anywhere. 

So why the delay?!  Are schools training our children to be a bunch of testicles that can't take the cold?  I'm just waiting for the day when she has a delay because the sun is too hot.

Maybe I feel like they're cutting her education short (over multiple "non-necessary" weather delays)...maybe I'm just bitter.  I don't have a delay for my job.  Meh. 









 Maybe she was looking at John Legend when Common was looking at her.  
  
Then again, he may have wondered what she was doing holding an invisible tray of food above her head and decided to skip that bullshit.

 How would you spread your persuasion throughout the world in only 24 hours, though? Webcam show, one by one, or try to jump in on a live broadcast? 




 And you wouldn't even need a million dollars. 




 I'll tell you the same thing I once told an *ex*-girlfriend:

I like it, but I think you could go...bigger. 




 Talk to the President and get him to push whatever you want through the system?

Oh wait, I think I know what you're talking about... 









 I stopped reading your comment after the word "place" and for a second there...I thought you were talking about me.

 Masturbating on Valentine's Day? Pathetic or not? 




 No lie, I have a version of that song in my car's mp3 player:

[I Can't Make You Love Me cover by Bon Iver](http://youtu.be/Q3VjaCy5gck)

You are definitely not the only one. Music has the capability of expressing what I'm feeling way more eloquently than what I could come up with. 




 At first, I got excited because my wife's name is also Janna...but then I realized she would never do anything like that for me. :(

Her Valentine's Day card would read more like...

"Just because it's Valentine's Day, that doesn't mean I'm going to touch you. Empty the trash." 




 :30 into the video is when the song starts. 









 At least Brian Regan can now get a cup of [black coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87QYajKxPn4).

All they would find would be a piece of my clothes, a small piece of my nose, and bone from my arm. 




 IMO, it depends on the degree of the accident.
  
Leaving vehicles involved in a traffic accident in the middle of the road (that could easily be moved to the side of the road) can cause traffic congestion and possibly another wreck down the line.  
  
If it's at all possible (car is capable of being moved, no one involved in the wreck is seriously injured, etc.)...it's a wise move to clear the road.

 Leslie Nielson was a serious actor before his role in Airplane!.  After that, he switched to comedy.  I could totally see Liam Neeson doing the same thing. 




 Me too. If they have their brights on, I won't flick mine to tell them...I just close my eyes and hope for the best. 
























 It sure did.  I mean, to see something with that much value in this world see it's demise in such a horrific way.  
  
I bet that port tasted so good... 




 How old is his daughter?  I think that if the weapon you use is underage, you can't be charged as an adult. 




 Reminds me of Jason Bourne when he fought that guy with only a pen.

 A game of 500+ card pickup can be hell on the back.  Maybe she ruptured some nerves while bending over to pick them up and effectively paralyzed herself from the neck down.  Once paralyzed, she fell to the floor, only since she's paralyzed...she couldn't catch herself and hit her head on your night stand and broke her neck.

If the original comes on television at any time of the day, I will watch at least 10 minutes of it. 




 Actually, if you go to the movie first, that gives you a subject to talk about while you're having dinner.  Whether it was a good or bad movie, you can jump start a conversation by sharing opinions about the movie. 




 This one time, I put two on to protect my wien...oh wait..."condiment". 
  
Never mind. 




 Water boarding? 




 Hmmm.  Bristle end or handle end? 




 That sounds like a great way to go.  And now I'm hungry for a brownie. 




 You live by the keyboard and you die by the keyboard, I guess.

 Might be me just being weird, but that one made me laugh out loud.  Just thinking of how you could do that. 




 Don't worry, I won't.  That rabbit hole is too deep. 




 That sounds like it came straight from the game. 




 I'm bored. 









 Not just a Supra, but a white one. I think that has some kind of imagery behind it. 




 Yes, I am glad that I didn't. I don't want him to worry about something that I did to myself in the past. He has his own issues to deal with and I didn't feel like burdening him with one of mine.

And what you said last is something that I find to be very true now. Last night I found out that my friend has gone through the same exact situation I'm in now...only 8 years ago. After our talk last night, I realized that we have a lot more in common than I originally thought. 




 I'm going through a lot of shit right now (that I don't feel like divulging at the moment). I got a text from a friend asking if I wanted to join him for some drinks at a bar tonight. I said sure and a couple of hours in, we were having serious conversations about our lives.

I came really close to telling him about how the scar on my arm was from when I felt my life was in a tailspin and the pain from cutting was the only thing that I could actually control. As soon as I got ready to say it, I chickened out. I just couldn't imagine what one of my closest friends would think about me.

I don't cut anymore, but every time I sweat while playing basketball or working out...it becomes very visible. I guess that will be with me for the rest of my life.

There's no real point to this post. I just needed to get that out.

The sheep do not want the dog around. He looks too much like the wolf. He reminds them that danger lurks out there just beyond the relative safety of the fence.
  
The wolf also hates the dog. He knows that it is the dog that stands between him and his prey. It is because of the dog that he is lean. The dog is the reason the wolf is forced to stalk the darkness.
  
The dog knows these facts. Undeterred, he stands watch, ever ready to do battle. Despite that he is a welcome guest in their midst, the dog is ready at a moments notice, to give his life in defense of his flock. It is simply who he is.

 If you have a job that offers a 401K...take advantage of it as soon as you can. 




 North Korea. 









 I like the shorter ears. 




 Thanks. 




 I liked the direction that went.  Now, I'm wondering what the dude sold his soul for.  Was it for the talking tat? 




 I have, but only just recently.  
  
About a month ago, she told me that she didn't love me anymore.  So, now I feel my role in this house is as a father only and not a husband.  
  
I'm on depression meds now, so...meh. 




 Too many fingers to be Mickey Mouse.  Childhood = unharmed. 




 Together for 4 months, married for 6 years.
  
I met her through a dating website and now I wish I would've spent that membership money on something that would actually love me back...like chicken wings and beer. 









 [George Lucas](http://www.comicbookmovie.com/images/users/uploads/31254/lucas%20laughing.jpg) can do that, too. 




 What would donut holes be then - do holes? That just sounds wrong...and I like it. 




 Polka Dotted Dick? 




 I never understood that one. What is red about it?? 









 Just because I've seen [creepier](http://media3.giphy.com/media/20uebR9TtbLwI/giphy.gif)... 




 If I were going to adopt, that's what I would tell the adoption agency. 




 How do you do that by accident? 




 Did you find out what it was exactly? 




 Geez, did they cut it with Kool-Aid? 









 [Take a look at the Batwing, bitch!](https://youtu.be/2T0G0njiNrA) 




 Hell, I'd buy one. 









 He's in [this](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4362342/) now.  It's an interesting show, but once again he carries his co-host...IMO. 









 Varsity Blues 









 [Kralik](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110429204417/prisonbreak/images/5/59/JeffKoberZachary_Kralik.gif) and then [Rack](http://iv1.lisimg.com/image/1293682/600full-jeff-kober.jpg).  
  
Different actor, but they also cast the same guy that played [Luke](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/buffy/images/2/2d/Luke.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110127011204) for [The Judge](http://www.thiel-a-vision.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/judge.jpg). 




 Oh, God, you're killing me! 




 [Already done.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0288415/) 




 Hundreds and thousands of what? 




 What flavor is blue cake exactly? 




 I do that, too. A cold egg roll is fantastic for a morning snack. 




 A co-worker of mine has a son that owns an Indian restaurant. He always invites me to join him, but I haven't been able to make it. I may have to take him up on that offer.

Any good suggestions? 




 You down with OP'sM'sP? 




 Wow! That should be a buffet item at Golden Corral.  Meatloaf, chicken casserole, a chocolate fountain, and pussy. 




 http://theladyandthebeard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/13.jpg 




 I find your choice of breakfast foods rather [shallow and pedantic](https://youtu.be/yetwdpsiM8Q). 




 Who is Food and why are you taking it from h...oh wait, never mind. 




 Did you eat it at 4:20 in the morning? 




 Emotional pain and sadness or asshole pain and sadness? 




 I don't eat Indian food and that is making me drool. 




 Would you eat that combo if you had to eat them all at once?  Wrap your Mars bar in a fruit rollup and take a bite of it while having a bite of the cauliflower cheese? 




 How many calories are in a serving of pussy?  Is it "heart-healthy"? 




 That doesn't seem like a lot of cereal...unless you hide ostrich eggs for Easter. 




 Daryl? 




 I've never heard of that before.  I don't eat a lot of Indian cuisine, though...so maybe that's why.  It looks good. 




 That's one of my favorites.  Something about the cold grease on top of the pizza.  Mmmm. 














 I work in the same environment and have had the same exact issue.

Sales manager at our sister plant in a different city calls IT. Says she has a new hire sitting in a cubicle, ready to work. No form was submitted to our department, letting us know anything about the new hire.

She asks what we can do for the new employee that day. I told her that we can give him some magazines to read until his thin client is set up, which normally doesn't take too long since we happen to have some in stock. Unfortunately, since she waited to tell us about the new guy...the new guy is going to wait until  *we*  get ready for him to work.

It may seem like we in the IT department are assholes, but everyone else is a bunch of bastards! 




 Sustained.  Bailiff, get me a badger for the witness. 




 Keystone Light needs to use this in a magazine ad...NOW!! 




 Well, the tube says to avoid getting in your mouth or eyes.  Now we see why.

 That's not gonna look good on the old resume. 




 Did he suffer from adult-onset [diabeetus](http://i452.photobucket.com/albums/qq245/ripalamungalin/i-dont-always-eat-cake-diabeetus.jpg)? 




 http://i.imgur.com/g2Yo3.gif 




 Sprinkle some coke on her lips and plant a knife.  A real knife, not a rubber one.   
  
Made that mistake one too many times... 




 I'm wondering...how so? 




 It's perfect, because a jury would never think you would be able to pull that off like that. 


































 Potato backwards! 




 Darthwing Duck. 




 [Yo](http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/220/5/e/xzibit_yo_dawg_render_by_kernelpanicx-d5aa710.png) 




 No.  I can't willingly make myself fart anytime I want.  I'm pretty sure I would shit myself if I tried. 




 Toilet paper.  It will be replaced with three sea shells... 




 A failing marriage. 









 [Hmmm...](http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/70/707e91a2cf8af3bdc2382f2ab0c88bc6c3df9924f4db80ce9464956d399d5a13.jpg) 




 Good or bad. 




 I could see this continuing as a series. 




 Not too bad for your first time. I liked the alien aspect. 




 If I don't survive, tell my wife, "Hello". 




 Hmmm, I bet you're one of them there left Twix eatin' sum bitches... 




 They don't necessarily have to cheat the people.  Just advertise that it is part of a healthy diet, because it is half the calories of a normal package of Twix and sell it for half the price.  
  
Boom. 




 If you keep the number of Twix the same in the packaging, then you would have left Twix and lefter Twix...and right Twix and righter Twix. 
  
No need to start a civil war inside of an already raging civil war, is there? 




 If they don't call themselves "Juggalos", it's time to riot in the streets. 














 I got it now.  I posted a WP earlier today and then saw that the first reply got deleted and responded to by the bot.  
  
Here I was thinking that the first person didn't like their story after they submitted it or something. 




 Dat wink, doe. 




 [I could see that.](http://media.giphy.com/media/fJoFlIydxlfXO/giphy.gif) 














 Why is that called a farmer turn? 




 Sounds like a great driving mantra to have stenciled on my car visor. 














 Should've shot him in the knee as soon as he bought it, to give his purple heart some weight. 









 Til my mom walks down the hall...

When she sees me, starts to bawl. 




 That is so fucking strange! When I posted this question, that song was in my head. 




 That seems like a lot of pressure. 




 Maybe its ass was whipped by Winamp... 









 If you're going to be royalty, you have to learn to [shut your mouth](http://i.imgur.com/MdjmzjJ.jpghttp://i.imgur.com/MdjmzjJ.jpg). 




 https://youtu.be/E5j4DIellR4 




 A little life advice for you then...don't become a K-5 teacher.  Those sick little, information-seeking, cute-when-they're-not-yours bastards will hug you as they foam at the mouth and think everything is fine.  
  
"I love you Mr. ____!"  
  
*proceeds to try and hug you*  
  
Yeah, back the fuck up. 




 "I'm a Barbie girl, in a Barbie world..." 




 I played disc golf back in college. One time at the course, I threw my disc and it came to a stop, leaning against a wooden fence post. I guess I wasn't paying much attention when I leaned over to grab it and I ended up sliding my middle finger down the grain of the post.

I ended up with a 2 inch splinter of wood being jammed up my middle fingernail...all the way. I had to go to the nearest urgent care facility to get shots in my finger and get it pulled out with tiny tweezers.

If I had any secrets that someone wanted to know at that time, I would have yelled them at the top of my lungs. 




 If someone tickles me, it makes me angry.

You wouldn't like me when I'm tickled...err...angry. 




 What if the torturer gave you an option of sugar cone or chocolate-dipped waffle cone for your eyeball afterwards? Would that help any? 







































 Oh yeah? Well, I just had sex with your girlfriend!

Since your statement was a little off, I figured the reply should be too. 




 Thor is pretty tight with Heimdall, and that dude can see EVERYTHING. 









 Maybe he's going by the DVORAK calendar layout. 




 Mom? 









 (http://i.imgur.com/MlHm0Zg.gif) 




 All that I do, is not enough for you. 









 Yes. 









 Ok...he's never *seen* me see his trouser wonder, from down under. 




 Boil em, mash em, stick em in a stew. 




 Why not? I'm too lazy to look that up. 




 Small is in the eye of the beholder.

I'm sure midgets wouldn't find it small...or maybe they would.

I've never seen your penis. 




 Just another movie of his where he would inexplicably get to mack on a beautiful actress. (Bridgette Wilson, Courtney Cox, Kate Beckinsale, Jessica Biel, Salma Hayek, Brooklyn Decker, Jennifer Aniston, etc.) 




 You know what they say...the bigger the berry, the sweeter the juice. 
























 [Gimmie a break](https://youtu.be/e4EAGiefnxc). 









 That was an amazing answer. Now, I want a monkey. 









 The scene in The Patriot when Mel Gibson's character is about to ride off to fight in a battle and he asks his daughter (who is traumatized from earlier events and hasn't spoken since) to give him just one word before he goes. She refuses, he goes to hug her, and she pulls away. As he's riding away, she stares him down and then says "Papa!". He jumps off his horse and runs to her. She says "I'll say anything, just please don't go" and hugs him.

I cry like someone has just replaced their testicles with onions and then teabagged my face for two and a half hours. 




 For every clown, there is a nightmare. 




 Asshole. 




 A person born blind. 




 That's really fucked up. Sorry. How has your life turned out? 









 ...love. 
























 Kinda strange for her friends to protect the person she just punched, eh? 




 What the fuck is wrong with that guy?  That is definitely something that you should have at least told your parents, shy or not.  
  
Did it leave a bruise or anything? 




 What was the subject, like midget porn or something? 




 That's how it starts. 




 What was the result? 














 [WHAT?!](https://i.warosu.org/data/sci/img/0071/49/1427144389384.gif) 




 I think this word makes it something I would like to be a customer of, but...  
  
", bitch!".  
  
Arby's - "We have the meats, bitch!"  
Burger King - "Have it your way, bitch!"  
Mountain Dew - "Do the Dew, bitch!"  
Popeye's - "Love that chicken from Popeye's, bitch! "  
Allstate - "You're in good hands with Allstate, bitch!"  
Bic - "Flick my Bic, bitch!"    
I Can't Believe It's Not Butter - "I can't believe it's not butter, bitch!"  
Subway - "Eat fresh, bitch!"  
Milk - "Got milk, bitch?!"  
LifeCall - "I've fallen and I can't get up, bitch!"

Edit - Added examples.
 




 I'm gonna rape that bitch... 




 If a comment makes my penis move...upvote.  It doesn't take much, either. 




 I'm going to London, England.  Once there...I'll take a car, go to the Winchester, have a nice cold pint, and wait for all of this to blow over.  
  
How's that for a slice of fried gold? 




 Don't piss in the wind and expect not to get wet. 




 If I tell you, then someone would know.  That  would initiate a logical paradox and that is something that I am not programmed to do. BEEP BOOP 




 That sheep herder's been married, long time ago. 









 I'd like to get a head start on that, but in some way it still feels like cheating. That is something that I will not do. I refuse to be that person.

Sorry if any of you are that person. I mean no disrespect. It's just my way of thinking. 




 Spot on. I like to think of it as...I will no longer be involuntary celibate. 









 Yeah. No doubt. 




 Exactly. 




 We are both in a financial pickle. 









 That way, I can go back to not having sex on my own terms. 
























 ...about the acid. 




 Nervous wood. 




 "I've been smelling you." 




 From a parent is probably the worst.

You don't know if they want you to empty the cat shit or they are getting a divorce. 




 Not trying to be shallow, but I look good in these jeans. 









 What would each gift do? 




 Took her to her favorite place (Olive Garden) and now a movie. 




 Cherish those dates. You will definitely miss them when they can't happen anymore. 




 Glad it was a good experience. 




 What would be a better name for it..."daddy/daughter being-at-the-same-place-at-the-same-time event"? 




 I'm 33, she's 14. 









 Example: 1981 - 33 years = 1948.  
  
My dad was 4 and my mom was 2. Dad was probably chasing a chicken around in a dirt yard and mom was probably making mud pies in the front yard. 














 Use whatever is in your underwear. 









 LIFE. 




 Ludacris has hoes in my area code. 




 [39-21-40](https://youtu.be/rfKRYPfcp6Q) 




 Just like James Dean. 




 I once took off my seatbelt when the "fasten seatbelt" sign was still lit. 









 I'm a guy...so of course I have.    
  

  
Question though - how do you put your upper head behind your back and then move it back and forth?  That's a neat trick.  Is it something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/1hhtwoG.jpg)? 




 put my heads behind my back  
  
  
  
How many damn heads do you have?!  You're already an alien... 









 "Scotty doesn't know!" 




 Help someone else masturbate. 




 "I am *sooo* much prettier than my twin sister." 




 [Mmm...donuts.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/86/b0/cd/86b0cde5b6c36d15314660219008b2b0.jpg) 




 I love boobs. 




 Soylent green. 




 Futurama. 




 Make sure your music playlist is on point. 




 I'll tell you what I'd do, man...two chicks at the same time, man. 




 Get married. 




 Past or present shows. 




 I'm 0 years old on Uranus...
  
It's like I haven't spent any time on Uranus at all. 




 Peeling a banana or from a bad sunburn? 









 Since she is a ginger ninja...her name should be "Ginja". 




 Maybe he just did Nazi her. 




 [Karen never quite got the point of potty training.](http://i.imgur.com/m8pBbFe.jpg) 




 86 and someone owes you one? 




 https://youtu.be/vu9oElKPnkg 




 Is this Craigslist? 




 Nailed it. 




 Correct. 




 My penis?  That's not an age, silly goose! 



















 Edit - any country, any branch of military. 
























 You could have a slot in your casket where the money is inserted, like an arcade machine.
  
No slugs or tokens! 




 So either your casket is going to be made out of cake, or your name is Beatrix. 









 I lost 80 pounds in the span of a year in my 20's.

It was great, but the only downside was the extra floppy skin I had around my stomach. I looked like someone stuffed a pancake in a muffin tin.

Lots of hard work after losing that initial weight has helped out in that area, but it's still not as tight as I'd like it to be. 




 Cats would be atheists. 




 Damn. That's not going to be good for me that day. At least I can get her a replacement, then. 

Thanks for the help! I appreciate it. 



















 I'd ask an elephant where I put my favorite koozie. 




 Apocalypse. I could be his fifth horseman...Sloth. 




 Irish people love to drink.

I've been Irish before and I'll probably be Irish again this weekend. 




 Play with your hair while talking to me. Also, a small eyebrow raise when I say something flirtatious. 




 When I was a kid, I believed that my tongue went all the way down my esophagus to my stomach. 




 Dying alone. 




 It's full of interesting bits of information. 




 Check all physical connections to the router. Hard reset if need be. 




 Definitely not like [this](https://youtu.be/xz0i94ABgD0). 




 I'd like to buy a Bob Barker, Alex. 




 Marriage. By next century, we'll all have sex bots. 




 Is it normal to send yourself dick pics? 




 At a bulimia support group. 




 Bosco...err...I mean, bingo! 




 I opened the door to my mom's Camaro as she was pulling into our gravel driveway. For some reason, my 8 year old self didn't have a seatbelt on and I went tumbling out. If she hadn't stopped the car when she did, my head would've been ran over by the back tire. Instead, I have a Harry Potter-like scar on my forehead to this day. 




 Buying Chinese parts and passing them off as ours. 100% made in America...right. 




 Why does my wife not love me? 




 That 80's Show. 




 Summer of George! 




 Why? How did it go? 




 ...and your legs. 




 Greg Giraldo. 




 Having someone rub my back until I fall asleep. 




 "I don't love you anymore." 




 Money. 




 Could it be my own? 




 Good thing that rail is there for head banging support. 




 Just because you put a line through the middle of something...that doesn't make it symmetrical (as shown by most of those clips). 




 Why is there an armrest on the left side of the driver's seat? 




 Toss them in front of cars that are behind me in traffic. 




 And is he bothering you at all...while he is across the aisle, with his headphones in, and minding his own business? 




 Before typing a response to this post, I mean. That reply is obvious. 




 The One With The Naked Naps 














 I lick the bottom of my shoe every Saturday to build up my immune system. 



















 I would yunk their brains out. 




 Choke them with a moose cock? 




 (   ) 




 My wife's vibrator. 




 Don't get married. It will hurt your heart in the end. 




 Double ew. 
























 If I took a shot to the liver so hard it made me feel like I shit in my boxers (heh...boxers), I'd appreciate whatever that person wanted me to appreciate. 




 I wonder what body part she'd punch you in if you touched her with your dick, instead of your elbow? 




 You should've taught them the wrong way to punch.  
  
"Ok, ladies.  What you want to do here is keep your fingers nice and loose.  Fold that thumb under your other fingers to protect it.  Also you always want to keep your wrist limp." 




 At least you didn't stick your dick in that crazy. 




 That's some dirty fighting, right there. 




 She must've learned her Muay Thai skills on the streets.  That and how to suck a dick for some coke. 




 Maybe you just found a new way for a girl to touch your junk.
  
"Hey girl.  Imma show you how to punch.  Just aim for the hands and if you miss and hit above my dick...next time just go a little lower and a lot softer."  
  
I like your style. 




 You're like the male version of Rosa Parks. 




 Seriously, fuck her.  Hate sex is great...from what I've seen in a movie. 




 [Or...](https://youtu.be/NEdPV-mh1js?t=18s) 




 I know.  That's why I edited my reply that was submitted before you edited yours. 




 Why didn't you retaliate on her? 




 Smelly? 




 What was the song?  
  
Edit: That's a relaxing melody. 




 He is definitely  a disturbed person. 




 How old were you? 




 Man, you shoulda been bobbin' and weavin'! 




 Is that a movie or a sex move that I don't know about? 




 And then cry alone in the bathroom afterwards? 




 What would she do? 




 Was she ugly? 




 What was she aiming for that she missed and hit you in your batch? 




 "I'll touch him alright...with a shoulder check, a trip, and what the hell...I'll throw in a left elbow to his outside ovaries." 




 How was it your fault?
