 Unless I'm mistaken there is no way to reverse balding and methods to slow it down are pretty ineffective. Why is this? What challenges are impeding a cure for baldness? 














 I'm interested in a bit of an overview of all major changes in hunting patterns, so feel free to take 'early humans' to mean any period you're most interested in answering for.

Anyway, I'm just curious as to how early humans actually approached a hunt. When did traps become popular? Did humans usually approach hunting in small or large groups? Silently, or did we tend to just bumrush animals with spears and arrows? Was it typical for a human to be able to just spear an animal for a kill with little effort, or would most hunts involve chasing an animal until it was tired, throwing out spears/arrows until it was too exhausted to avoid them. 









 Having played both LoL and Dota, I'm amazed at how badly LoL players overstate the problems associated with voice chat. These team oriented games benefit greatly from ease of communication, I find it weird to not include it. Does HotS have voice chat? 




 Have Valve ever made an official statement on Dota 2 achievements? 




 After reading a TIL today, I just realised how little I know about the Vietnam War. Like, embarrassingly little. Can anyone recommend a good book on the subject as a whole? 




 Anyone from [this list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_heads_of_state_and_government) is valid, however, for the sake of simplifying things, feel free to just use the leaders you're familiar with and see if someone one ups you.

* Round 1: an all out fight in a large, empty arena. No hiding or leaving the arena until everyone has tapped out, been knocked unconscious or been killed.

* Round 2: A large woodland, 5km by 5km. Everyone starts at a random location with no knowledge of the area. Tools are their standard attire (eg. Obama in a suit etc), a hunting rifle with 12 shots, a handgun with a single bullet, a machete and two litres of water. They must hunt each other and survive the elements until only one is standing. Weather conditions are cold, prone to rain. Water and animal life is scarce. There are some bears, but most animal are not aggressive. This is mostly a test of survival skills and hunting ability - both the ability to remain undetected and to detect others.

* Round 3: Each leader gets the powers commonly attributed to them in popular culture and propaganda. 




 ELI5: What are the major differences between a Prime Minister and a President? Specifically, US and Australia? 




 And does the same apply to all solar systems? Or was much of the matter created during the early development of the universe? 









 Is there any way to sort my workshop subscriptions by game? 




 I've played the game before, but never finished. I'm intending to just go for the main quest this time around and want to do it with mods (which I haven't done before). So, hit me with 5 I should use. 









 Seems like it's great for developers, but what does it actually mean for me as a consumer? 




 Is it possible? Anyone have the IP? 




 It would play more or less exactly the same as Dota, but the characters would be personnel of Russia's Ministry of Finance. You could play as many personalities such as Anton Siluanov, Roman Artyukhin, various secretaries and accountants, and even State Secretary-Deputy Minister of Finance Sergei Shatalov.

I might even include some of the greats from the past such as Yegor Gaidar and Mikhail Zadornov.

If it's a success, I'm also thinking of creating spin-offs such as France's Ministry of Agriculture. Who would pass on a chance to play as Agriculture Minister Dominique Bussereau? Not many I would think. 




 I'm currently 23, almost 24, and about to finish my Bachelor of Accounting. I feel like my resume is very underwhelming so I want to gain some work experience before beginning my job search. I'm thinking of calling some places up tomorrow, but I feel pretty weird about it. Most of my peers seem to already be 'out' in the world and I've only ever worked casual jobs. When I think of work experience I think of 18 year olds tops. Am I too old to old or is my anxiety unfounded?

Australian if that's at all relevant. 




 Like, OK, you might leave an chip packet and mountain dew can on your desk when you're in the middle of a session. Maybe you occasionally go back for a second without cleaning up the first and it looks a little messy. But eventually you decide to throw it out... or most people would. How can these people let such small messes become such big messes. It takes zero effort to throw your rubbish in the bin whenever you next get up, but they voluntarily leave it there?

I can't get into the minds of these people, what's the cause of this condition? I can understand massive weight gain because at least it takes effort to lose weight and eat right, but I just can't understand letting something so simple to manage spiral so far out of control. 




 Just out of curiosity? When I was job hunting I'd often try and apply for jobs same day, which lead me to getting stressed quite a bit if I found a lot I liked in the same day. However, I ironically landed the one job I procrastinated for applying for, which had been open for two weeks. It got me wondering if maybe I didn't need to be so worried with applying ASAP. So, for future reference, how long are jobs typically open for?

I'm Australian if that affects anything. 









 As in, do you (or have you ever) made it a matter of course to browse through people's pictures, videos, website accounts, etc. when repairing a computer? What's the most interesting thing you've found? Do most people have weird ass porn fetishes? 









 In the movie Schindler's list, there's a wonderful scene where Schindler is sobbing because he couldn't save more Jews. Is this scene based on reality at all? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0T1od5dUoA 




 Some of the key characteristics of the Borg is their very stiff movement and a disregard for their environment save for their immediate objectives. While this works well for them when you treat the drones as simple fodder to achieve low key objectives, with most of their strength coming from their advance technology and space warfare, they would still be highly inefficient in ground combat.

I'm not saying they'd be bad, they can hand a large amount of firepower, are probably quite accurate with phasers and have exceptional strength - you wouldn't want a bunch of Borg advancing on your position. But they're still less efficient then they could be - they don't seem to exhibit a lot of fine motor movement which would be handy for navigating a battlefield (trenches, caves, barricades, etc) nor do they run, meaning it would be easy to retreat from them, they could get picked off easily, etc.

**So my question is this:** do the Borg simply not possess the technology to make highly efficient, 'athletic' Borg soldiers? Or is it simply due to the fact that it is not required of them to achieve their goals that making Borg this complex would use more resources than they would gain? 




 Just a quick one, but which of these three entities would win if they started setting their sights on each other? 




 So I've rewatched the original movie a couple of times since the reboot has been out, and I noticed a few things over the course of the film that I believe support this hypothesis.

First, before I go into this, you have to keep in mind that Taylor and his crew traveled FORWARD through time for many thousands of years, giving enough time for all the necessary changes to take place. Now, onto the evidence.

Firstly, when Taylor arrives of the Ape planet, he discovers that it is perfectly hospitable. The right makeup in the air, the right distance from the sun, drinkable water, etc. The odds of this happening are actually incredibly slim. Even an amateur astronomer can tell you that. It's not definitive proof, since there could be some fluke that makes an equally habitable planet with the same landscapes and sky as Earth, but it's highly unlikely and is a big hint that this planet may be Earth right off the bat.

Secondly, evolution is a very complex thing, and it is not conceivable to think that by sheer luck, a second planet would evolve humans, apes and horses on it AND that Taylor would happen to land on that planet. This is absurd. The apes and Taylor also share a common language - English. Whatever happened on Earth during these few thousand years to eliminate the humans and cause the apes to become smart was not enough to eliminate written and spoken language. The apes adopted this language as their own, allowing Taylor to communicate with them. Also many of the apes names are also human names, clearly adopted in addition to the English language.

Third; at the end of the movie, Dr. Zaius hints at some sort of catastrophe. Something clearly happened on this planet and could explain its current state - like a war that reduced the humans to small tribes allowing the apes to take over.

Finally, the very last scene shows Taylor confronting the statue of Liberty, an Earth structure. His inititial assumption is that the statue of liberty was blown up and the debris traveled through space. I suggest that the statue has been in this position all along, just decayed with time... **EARTH** 




 Alright, first things first, I'm not sure if this is appropriate for this subreddit, so if not let me know and I'll delete the post. If anyone knows of a better place, please share. So onto the question...

I've been watching a lot of older sci-fi and it all seems very twist heavy, and it got me thinking, how surprising where the twists when they first appeared in cinema? On one side of the coin - even if you hadn't seen or heard of the twists before, you can still 'see them coming', they all seem kind of obvious. However, today's audiences are probably more trained to that sort of thinking, right? Would older twists have been more likely to take people by surprise, even if they'd seem obvious to movie goers today? Twists still predated movies and television too, so it's not like it was a new concept.

Some specific examples I'm interested in - were most people surprised by the twists in:

* Planet of the Apes
* In general, The Twilight Zone
* Hitchcock's Psycho
* Soylent Green
* Invasion of the Body Snatchers (haven't seen original, but I'm referencing the end of the 1978 version where it leads you to believe he is human trying to fit in, but is actually 'snatched')
* That one dude being a robot in Alien (forgot his name)

 I have a lot of questions I'm interested in asking someone who knows a lot about cinema, like "how was this twist perceived at the time" or "what was making a movie like in 1935". Basically, not just trivia, but questions about movies in a historical context, from a cinema historian or whatever they'd be called. What's the best subreddit to ask these sorts of questions?

Basically, the r/askhistorians of movies. 









 Just bumped into a player who is abusing 1v1 mode in order to farm compendium points. He is picking Nature's Prophet, deliberately feeding to end the game prematurely and requeuing. Is there anyone I should report him too and is this a known thing? 









 The real life counterparts of Donkey Kong and the bosses from his last two games battle it out in a series of 1v1s. These are rough approximations of the animals real life counterparts and some liberties had to be taken (especially with the more fictional bosses from the first game).

**Donkey Kong**

Stronger side of the typical Gorilla. Approximately 200kg, 1.9m tall.

**Opponents:**

* Ba-Boom, a Chacma Baboon, the largest of the baboon species. Around 45kg, about 1.1m tall.

* Bashmaster, a large polar bear, around 650kg size male.

* Pompy, a full grown sea lion, around 300-350kg, about 2.5m long

* Lord Fredrik, a male pacific walrus around 2,00kg

* Mugly, fictional, so let's just say he sort of triceretops like in stature I suppose

* Thugly, we'll say a White Rhinoceros, about 3,500kg and 3.5 long

* Colonel Pluck and his Stompybot 3000. No real world equivalent, so instead it's a man driving a Smart Car (can attempt to run the Gorilla down)

* The ragtag bunch, all the leftovers team up against the gorilla: a mole, a gray owl, a yellow blowfish, a dodo and 3 Japanese Spider Crabs.

**Round 1**

Each boss fights our gorilla. Who wins? Does Donkey Kong sweep the competition in real life, or does he find himself greatly outclasses? Each battle takes place on a plain, open field in daylight. The animals are displaying their fullest aggression.

**Round 2**

Of all the animals that beat the gorilla, who of those would be victorious if they all fought eachother? 




 So it's been a pretty big secret to who this Batman character really was with many characters discussing the possibilities throughout the movies. But I think I have gathered enough evidence to show that Lucious Fox was indeed Batman the whole time.

1. Lucious had access to all the technology that Batman had used throughout the series as the head of Wayne Enterprises military contracts division. This can be clearly seen from all the scenes in which he is showing off the technology to the Bruce Wayne character.
2. The movie spends a disproportionately large amount of time focusing on Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent for some reason. Why? So it seems more natural to have Lucious Fox on screen.
3. Lucious Fox CLEARLY hints at being Batman in the scene where he is confronted by that accountant dude or whatever.
4. Batman dresses in all black. Lucious Fox is black
5. Why the Bat theme? Bruce Wayne has a fear of bats. Lucious spends a large time around Wayne. Wayne most likely relayed his fear of bats to Lucious
6. There is no other likely contender from the movies main characters (Dent would be too busy during the day to go around at night crime fighting, Alfred is too old, Gordan and Batman are seen on screen at the same time, Bruce Wayne is too busy working out, taking tours of the military contract division, hiding from the public eye and playing with bat themed military gadgets to go around crime fighting)
7. I zoned out of the movies a lot to be honest, which means that there was probably LOTS of evidence I overlooked suggestions Lucious is Batman, which is EVIDENCE IN ITSELF. 




 Preferably spoiler free? Unfortunately I live in the middle of nowhere and my Internet sucks to much to stream. 




 [So I posted this the other day](http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/29886w/do_i_need_to_apply_new_thermal_paste/) to PCmasterrace. Seemed like I needed to replace my thermal paste, so I did yesterday, but it hasn't seemed to have helped my temperature issues. I'm still hitting the same temperatures. After the paste didn't work the first time, I took it off to check it looked right (it did) and reapplied a second time. So I'm guessing it's not the paste (unless there's a break in period, but I haven't noticed even a slight temperature drop. Paste was Deep Cool Z9).

Is there anything else that might be wrong that I should check? I have a Corsair H50 and it feels like water is still being pumped when I put my finger on the tubes.

What should I check next? 




 Firstly, I'm not amazingly good with computers. I've installed a new graphics card in the past but that's about it.

Anyway, currently, my CPU's temperature is sitting at about 70-75 degrees celcius when idle and 80+ when gaming. I haven't had any performance issues until today, so I don't know how long its been hitting this temperature for, but it's seems to be causing some issues today.

I cleaned off the fans and checked how fast they were spinning with speedfan (CPU fan 4450 rpm, system fan 1580 rpm). I did a quick google and these speeds seem to be normal. So that leaves me with two possibilities.

The first is that water cooling system. I didn't build this PC, but the person who did told me I shouldn't need to do anything with this maintenance wise since its a closed system. Is this true?

If so, that leaves the heatsink. It's (obviously) very hot to the touch. I'm a little worried about taking it off since I'm worried I'll fuck up my PC, but is this the likely issue? How can I check for certain before I try reapplying paste? And anything I should know before doing so?

Thanks.

(perhaps there is a better subreddit to ask this?) 














 Just for some fun, what ideas would you like to see for future Steam events? Considering most people are unhappy with the direction Steam's sale events have taken (cash grab instead of achievement hunts) what would you like to see instead?

My idea is probably a little too much effort for how little Valve would get out of it, but it would be cool to see a series of 'Camp Contests' utilising the current team system instead of buying items in the top Valve games.

For example, a Dota 2 could have a special queue open that matches you with people on your Steam team. The winning team contributes 50 points, each tower 10 points and each kill 1 point to your team's summer sale score.

Could do similar with TF2 and CS:GO as well as . In addition to random players on the winning team each day getting their games, top 5 MVP's from each game (any team) could get their wishlist games or something.

Of course, I doubt this would ever happen since it's harder to monetize, but I think it'd be a much more exciting community event instead of this money spending competition. 














 With only 15 crafted, I wanted to get an idea of their current value. I had a look on Dota2lounge and the steam market and can't find the level 5 treasure or the helmet in either place. It's gotten me curious: do you think some of those 15 that have been crafted so far may never see the light of day? Although Dota 2 has a huge fanbase, there are still people who haven't played it or stopped playing it and may not realise the value of the item they have. 




 Most people probably already know which hero they want to play when they queue. You don't need to consider allies picks. Can we have a shorter (10-30 second) character select timer and a 30 second pre-start period? Or something along those lines? 




 It seems a little lacklustre without it. 









 I never played it online and I really hope SSB WiiU has some proper matchmaking system instead of just queuing you with completely random individuals - that'd just lead to a series of one sided matches.

Even something simple like Mario Kart's system. So did Brawl have a matchmaking/ranking system and if so, was it any good at pairing you with like-skilled individuals? 




 Is there any reason Sniper got no lines in Love   War? 




 So I'm not particularly good at Chess, so maybe I'm overlooking something obvious. But, I sometimes like to set up random positions against the Chess.com computer and play against it at max strength and get utterly trounced by it. But today it made a weird move.

I'll start from a few moves in - personally I find context helps, but better players can probably just skip to the next paragraph if you'd rather just jump straight to the point. Basically, starting from [THIS](http://imgur.com/cVLxxma) position (me white, computer black) I took the computer's Queen with the a pawn. It took my castle with the black square bishop and captured that bishop with my knight. Then the computer moved the king to D7 and I captured the second Bishop. It moved the King to C6 leaving us [HERE](http://imgur.com/51se0oN).

Then I realised my Knight was trapped and just moved to capture the black pawn with my knight. [May as well take a pawn if I'm moving my knight](http://imgur.com/doWtvLG). I expected the computer to just recapture with the King, but instead it did moved the rook on a8 to a1. I captured the rook with my remaining rook for a free piece and [THEN it took the knight with the king.](http://imgur.com/tZ4YTIn)

So, basically, why did the computer (set at the strongest difficulty) throw away the rook like that? I'm sure it's something obvious that will make me facepalm. 




 Just an idea (probably not an original one), but how would you guys feel about seeing complementary item sets for Io and his partners?

For example, CK and Io could each have a "Global Chaos" set for whatever. Io cosmetics are hard, but maybe custom tether animation, Wisp balls that look 'Chaos Knightish' and makes his colour a more darkish red. Maybe CK's set adds some Io elements somehow.

Anyway, when both have their sets equipped, they'd get a more powerful looking tether animation, different relocate symbol and relocate timer and other assorted effects unique to that set.

Could do this with all Io partners. 



















 I'm interested in seeing the group stages, but moreso I want to plan some free time around the games I want to watch live. Does Valve usually release the group stage schedule in advance or will I have to wait til the day? 




 and if so, does it accommodate for it in anyway? For example, would Bobby Fischer's 1972 rating of 2785 be considered 'better' than a 2785 of today, or could it be fairly said that a rating of 2850-2900 be a more significant accomplishment then Fischer's rating? 




 And if so, free or paid? Will there be a 'season pass' type deal? 




 After reading [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/27hb10/a_game_named_steam_the_game_appeared_on_store_for/), what would you like to see in a Steam 'meta' game?

An actual simulation of using Steam similar to the [Newgrounds sim](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/236362)?

A unique TCG featuring Valve characters and other popular Steam game card sets?

Maybe a mini-game HUB (Chess, Poker, Checkers, and other traditional board and card games complete with ladders and rankings)?

These last two could follow Valve's traditional F2P model and would help tighten the Steam community.

Or is this too much of a cash n' grab? What other ideas could be cool? 









 Or do I have to use that ugly hat? 




 Can be TV, movie, album outtake, etc. 




 That AREN'T developed by Valve. 














 I remember a match with where Na'vi randomed Zeus (I believe). Does anyone have the link to that and other pro games where there have been random heroes. Has there ever been an entire 5 hero random?

 Is global population likely to have a major effect on the standard of living anytime soon? Is there a tipping point where we won't be able to 'turn back'? Are we simply judging overpopulation by our current infrastructure, but could very easily deal with a much large population by simply building more?

Something I worry that my future grandchildren might have to face, but am admittedly very ignorant on. But seeing that the world population went from 3 billion to 7 billion in just 50 years is both amazing and scary. 









 I'd love to see a minor content update - anything - to justify Valve slapping that game back on the front page again. It was really fun, but the community is basically non existent at the moment. The game is just sitting there, perfectly playable, free to play, with no one touching it. 









 And how did his superiors feel about him burning 11(?) of their navy's ships? Frankly I'd be a little pissed. Were they expensive or important ships? 









 Long story short, trying to upgrade through the store has been a hassle. Several seconds into the install, the Store app just crashes. I can go back to my desktop, but trying to open store again (by moving my mouse to the top left of the screen) just causes the Store to boot from scratch. I literally can't get more than a few seconds into the download.
Is there another way to go about this? Like a torrent or disc I can order from Microsoft?

 Twitch just loads so slowly for me, it's unwatchable and buffering is unreliable in my experience. 




 What exactly does Blizzard do during maintenance each week? I'm surprised a company as large and experience as Blizzard needs to effectively cut people off from their games once a week. For me, someone who can only play between certain times, I literally can't play at all on Tuesdays.

Edit: No idea why I'm getting downvoted, I'm genuinely curious as to what the maintenance process is, why it needs to be so regular and why they need to take all games and servers offline at the same time to perform it. I'm not in IT.

 Only Sherlock knows of the crime as Moriarty explicitly told him he was planning it, but otherwise knows no details. Instead of solving the crime himself (someone has to make all this delicious honey), he sends notice to the world's best detectives to step in and thwart Moriarty instead. Unfortunately, they too are also busy, and decide to send their sidekicks in their places.

Which sidekick has the best chance of solving the crime?

* John Watson (original Doyle Sherlock canon)
* Natalie Teeger (Monk)
* Robin (Adam West Batman)
* Gus (Psych)
* Luke Triton (Professor Layton)
* Richard MacDuff (Dirk Gently)
* Penny (Inspector Gadget)
* Shaggy (without the rest of the gang)
* Tin Tin's dog

 How much additional data is there to download after installing data from the PC version of FFXIV: ARR? 




 One of the biggest criticisms of WoW is its grind. I have to admit, at the moment, I'm not having too much fun. It seems that everyone I know absolutely adores WoW, but right now, I'm not digging it. Can someone please tell me what I can expect from the game in the long run and where it 'picks up'?

Secondly, right now, I'm currently leveling my first new character. I'm playing the game as the game downloads (it's not even at optimal yet) and I'm experiencing about 200-600 ping. I'm wondering: What is the ping typically like for Australian players? I'm hoping this ping is just due to the client downloading data as I play.

 I really like the idea of MMORPGs, but the few I've played have failed to truly engage me. Could someone recommend me something - preferably an upcoming title - that might actually satisfy me. 

The ones I put the most time into were:

* Star Trek Online: Loved the space battles and just the general feel of traveling through space. But everything else sucked. Combat felt skill-less, lack of variety in ship parts. Once the space battles began to grow repetitive I found myself completely bored with the game.
* Guild Wars 2: Felt very fun and polished at first, but I never quite made it to endgame. It felt incredibly spammy and the classes felt very homogenized. But man, the combat, so spammy. I also disliked how leveling up meant next to nothing and equipment was practically the same for everyone.
* World of Warcraft: The big one. I actually just made my first character two days ago. I'm currently level 6 and all I've done is walk around killing x monsters for quest y. Over and over. I understand I'm 10 years late to the party, so I don't blame the game, but playing it for the first time in 2014 it looks bad, it plays bad, the spells feel so unfun and the quests are terrible. I've barely played it so I'm not going to make final judgement on it, but if the quests continue at this pace I can't see myself putting in more than another hour or two.

**Preferred Genres (Fantasy, Sci-Fi, etc.):** Any, but a good ship based Sci-fi would be great

**Pricing Model:** Any

**Favorite Features:** Engaging combat - the more skill based the better, smooth and 'flowing' combat (for comparison, WoW and Star Trek's ground combat feel pretty 'clunky'), good ping on Oceanic servers for Australians a plus

**Combat Type**: Any

**Released or Upcoming:** Either, preferably upcoming


Eve Online seems like the obvious choice, but I'd prefer recommendations other than that. It's on my to do list, but currently I feel like it's too big of a time investment from what I've heard, I just wouldn't have time to properly get into it between work and Uni. 




 Just upgraded to iOS7 and I want to change the music app back.

Specifically, I dislike having to scroll through every song to find an album I want. I don't understand why they made this change. I tend to have large collections from my favourite artists and like to listen to lots of different albums. For many artists I listen to regularly I have well over 20 albums. Is there any way I can change the app (settings I've overlooked?) so it goes Artist  Album  Song instead of Artist  Album+Songs. 




 New to this game, just wondering what the general consensus on the state of the game's balance is.

What about specific cards or strategies? 




 I can't even begin to fathom getting angry over something like this. A different set of words were used to sing a song? Why is this making people upset? What negative consequences do they think will happen? Is the average person actually annoyed, or just vocal minority?

 This looks pretty similar to Tribal Wars, a game I used to love a fair bit. However I've heard this is pay to win? Is it true? I don't mind some minor P2W elements as long as I can remain reasonably competitive, but I get no enjoyment out of winning (or losing) based on having spent real money.

TL;DR: How (if at all) P2W is this game? 




 I know these sorts of topics are starting to become a bit disliked here, but I'm really interested in this one.

It's Geralt from the books. He has been hired to slay the beast and thus gets a reasonable amount of prep time (say a few days)/knows what he's getting into. He has all his swords and any potions from his universe available to him. If the monster has a weak point, he is aware of it. The monster is being introduced into the Witcher universe for this battle so Geralt can only use the resources from that universe to create monster traps or whatever will aid him in the battle.

The battle takes place in an environment that the monster has chosen to settle down in. Ie., if the monster likes swamps, it will naturally habitat a swamp somewhere in the Witcher universe for the fight.

Also use a loose definition of the word 'monster'. Basically just keep human-like species and superheroes out of the mix.

TL;DR: What's the strongest monster a fully prepared Geralt of Rivia can beat. 




 I'm sure discussing ideas for new Trek series has probably grown long since uninteresting to everyone here, but I'm going to give this discussion a shot anyway!


When would be the best timeframe for a new Trek series to be set? For example, do you think the technological advancements made at the end of Voyager would make a post-Voyager Trek too uninteresting setting? By 2400~, Starfleet has already created technologies that allow a ship to be modified to go toe to toe with multiple Borg ships (keep in mind these are just modifications, so the actual ships from 2400 would be even stronger). Time travel also seems to be ridiculously easy and rampant at this point. Would a series set in this point in time deal with too much 'overpowered' stuff and rely too heavily on introducing ludicrously strong antagonists to compensate? And coming up with reasons why X technology can't be used to solve problem Y? 


Could a new Trek series deal with a technological stagnation - or maybe even regression - in a post year 3000 Star Trek (or whenever the Star Trek time travel from Enterprise took place)? Or is this moving too far away from the franchises beginnings?


What about setting a show in the past again (except this time: actually dealing with historical Trek storylines instead of introducing new ones...)? What era would be most suitable for this purpose? Or has all the interesting stuff already been dealt with?


TL;DR: If a new Trek were to be made, when should it be set and why? Keeping in mind this is not for ideas for a new Trek, but rather meant for a discussion of the state of the current Trek universe and what challenges may be present in creating a new Trek, although it's fair if concepts for shows naturally creep in. Just don't give us the script to your pilot ;) 




 After reading on wiki about [Paul Kern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kern) I am curious about a few things. Firstly, the article is very lackluster. Is this case considered to be genuine, and if so, are there any modern theories as to how he lost the ability to sleep?

Secondly, most theories of sleep treat sleep as a regenerative function (some treat it as a way of conserving energy). If sleep truly is a regenerative function, how is it theoretically possible for Paul Kern to have functioned (he reported feeling not-tired 24/7) without sleep?

Lastly, would it be viable to deliberately damage people's brains in the same fashion to eliminate the human need for sleep? What exactly where the drawbacks in Kern's situation? 




 I pretty much listen to no hip-hop, but loves these two albums (that, and Gorillaz). 

Which Kanye albums are closest to these two and what other albums should I try? I'm not actually a huge fan of rapping, but the music itself is growing on me. 




 Kirk, Picard, Sisko, Janeway and Archer have been plucked from their respective timeline (their peak in each series to be precise) and forced to face-off in a showdown of 11 events. The winner in each category earns two quatloos, second place one quatloo, and the worst contender loses a quatloo (can go negative). Who places where in each category and who comes out with the most quatloos?

* **ACAMEDIA**
* Round 1: Kobayashi Maru test
* Round 2: Starfleet grade average (can select own course and electives as per standard Starfleet academic course)
* Round 3: Quiz-off: Five player Jeopardy showdown

* **ATHLETICS AND FITNESS**
* Round 4: 400 meter dash
* Round 5: Tennis doubles playoffs (2nd in command as their partner)
* Round 6: Highest climb of Mount Everest before giving up/dying
* Round 7: Who survives the longest against a Gorn in a cage match (standard wrestling cage).

* **DIPLOMACY**
* Round 8: A series of debates on ethical issues
* Round 9: Best handling of an accidental first contact with a primitive civilization (holodeck so each scenario is starts exactly the same) 

* **MACKIN' ON SPACE BABES**
* Round 10: Who can pick up the most people in one week.

* **BATTLE ROYALE**
* Round 11: A series of 1v1 fights. No weapons, fight in standard TOS uniform. Takes place in a boxing arena. No rules, any fighting style, fight until one contender concedes or dies.

Tennis match, debates and battle royale are all round robin format. Everyone challenges everyone else with a point awarded for a win. Most points to least points to determine final winners of that category.

Edit: My Reddit formatting sucks, this will have to do :) 




 In Call of Cthulhu, he can't outrun a steamship, doesn't have any long range attacks (otherwise he would have blown up the steamship), I'm not sure if his wings are functional and he seems to be limited to physically attacking his targets with his hands and feet. His magic seems to be limited to resurrectiobn.,

I always pictured him as some all powerful reality bender (just based on how people talk about him), but it seems he would lose to any decent military, any moderately high tier superhero in a 1v1, or pretty much any of the major Kaiju, right?

or did I miss something (not at full power?) 




 Basically, what are the best non-canon Sherlock stories?

Also, bonus question: What's the most ridiculous Sherlock to be published by a serious publisher (not just some X-Men/Sherlock crossover fanfic where Sherlock nails Wolverine or some shit). 




 Looking for something to read and wondering if there are any good Trek novels. Any recs? 




 Did anyone find out what he was referencing here? Also, this implies that there actually is an 'official' way Sherlock faked his death, right?

Edit: I'm assuming the airbag explanation was a joke, but assuming it's the real one, I'm still interested to know what the missed clue was. 









 Are there any missables I should take note of in the Witcher 2? For example, the smithy in Flotsam sells a lot of cool diagrams, are they worth buying up now for later use? Or will I always be able to get the diagrams?

What about missable quest arcs? 
























 No weapons, no armour, etc.

Just an all out brawl. 




 Basically, which classic rivalry (Sherlock vs Moriarty, The Joker vs Batman, Goku vs Vegeta, etc.) is the most one sided.

Try not to include matchups that are obviously one sided (like comedic relief villains) or small time/one off villains, I'm looking for classic matchups that spread over the life of franchises. 




 Vulcans, Klingons, Jem'hadar, Humans, Romulans, Cardassians and Gorn.

As I understand, Vulcans are the strongest. Even Vulcans who don't seem to actively engage in physical fitness seem to be very strong. I believe Sisko said a fit Vulcan is three times as strong as a fit human.

Apart from that, I've never quite known where everyone else sits. For example, Romulans are meant to be closely related to Vulcans, but they don't seem to have their intelligence or psychic powers, so is their physical strength at all similar?

Klingons are inconsistent. Some times they're taken down in batches by humans they outnumber, yet they're meant to be a fierce warrior race. On the flipside, there is an episode where B'ellana Torres beats a Vulcan in a fight, despite B'ellena not being 100% Klingon or a combat specialist (and looking much scrawnier than the average Vulcan), while the Vulcan was in a rage. Now he may have just been a particularly weak Vulcan, but he certainly didn't seem to be. Apart from that instance, I've always seen their reputation as warrior having more to do with their relentlessness than their actual strength, with them being roughly on par with humans in all aspects bar durability (redundant organs etc).

Jem'hadar are genetically designed to be a super warrior species, but they don't seem any stronger than humans or Klingons. Meanwhile, Gorn are stronger than humans, but slower, meaning a fight could go either way (maybe if Kirk were a boxer he might have been able to outmaneuver and beat the Gorn down?). Also are they stronger than Vulcans? 

Cardassians seem like a wildcard.

Am I on the mark with most of this? Is there an official power ranking index or something (like how Marvel ranks their characters out of 7(?) in categories such as intelligence, strength, powers, etc.)? 




 Who comes 1st, 2nd and 3rd? Who goes the largest sum in Final Jeopardy? 









 Excuse me if I'm getting some details wrong, I haven't seen Voyager since it's original run. Anyway... What limits are there on the Q's power? What is the source of their power?

For example, in "Death Wish" we see Quinn actually transport Voyager to the time of the big bang (and, if I recall correctly, they were 'outside' of it witnessing it, which means Q's powers transcend the very reality they were originally a species of), could will people in and out of existence and all other matter of seemingly omnipotent feats.

However, in The Q and the Grey, the Voyager crew use the Q weapons against the Q, implying that the most powerful tools available to the Q are independent of themselves (not innate, like a God) and can be interacted with by any physical being. So this raises a bunch of questions:

1) Do the Q still have innate powers in addition to their weapons? If not, how did Quinn manage to use the Q weapons despite being exiled? If so, how do they compare?

2) Where are these weapons/tools located?

3) Does this extend to all (seemingly) omnipotent Star Trek races?

4) Are the Q physical entities using these weapons from a remote location, or have they 'transcended' beyond physical form? If the latter, how did Q intend to incorporate physical DNA into a non-physical entity.

I'm sure a lot of these questions are unanswerable, but the Q were always one of my favorite species and I hated the treatment they got on Voyager and thought maybe there's some canonical explanations I've overlooked for some of these questions. 




 I still prefer mouse+keyboard for the most part, but there are a few games where I like to whip out my PS3 control (Dark Souls, Castle Crashers, Batman: Arkham series to name the games from this year) and it would be a nice option to be able to play these on my television.

So basically what should I know before I buy a new TV? Can someone post some estimated minimum specs for running, say, Dark Souls II at max on a 50in? 









 Wasn't even on the front page yesterday (unless I overlooked it) now it's number 1. I usually only see this sort of surge during tournaments, but there doesn't seem to be one running. 




 Anything similar to any of his albums, I feel like I've listened to them all 1,000 times and love them all. 




 Just played my 9th game of online matchmaking, I'm bronze league. Just got placed against a guy who stomped me. I checked his profile after: 1999 career games, has been placed in diamond league repeatedly in the past. I've played against several silver and gold players as well.

Why am I being matched against players like this? What's the point of the leagues if I get matched against players outside of them? The game is a lot of fun, and playing against more experienced players will probably help me learn faster, but doesn't it kind of make a lot of games a complete stomp? Or do I just need to play more to get placed in a more reliable bracket? 









 I've just started playing, is there a particular order I should learn the races in? I feel the Protoss are probably the easiest, but I find them to be a bit boring, but I don't think my macro is good enough yet to use the Zerg. Humans seem easiest after Protoss.

I'm going to look at some beginner Zerg guides, but should I just stick to getting used to the game through Protoss first? Or is it OK for a beginner to just jump right in to any race? 




 Particularly want to hear from Uni lecturers/TA's. 









 Particularly, the thumb pads. I really was never a fan of touchscreen devices because they lack tactile features and feel a tad more unwieldy. 














 So my brother is overseas at the moment and I wanted to get him some Steam games so we can play together for Christmas. Thing is, I already mailed his physical present to him before I got this idea, and 7 days from XMas is too short notice to get another to him. So I thought of doing it digitally. But instead of buying him a game, I thought I could just gift $50 to spend as he pleases.

Is there an option to just fill someone's Steam wallet with a message like you would get if you sent them a game? 




 I understand this is an Alpha, so please don't confuse this with complaining - I'm just genuinely curious to know if there's more to the game than I'm seeing.

So far, I've just run around an empty landscape, occasionally bumping into other players who do very little before wandering off. I have played for 40 minutes and have encountered two zombies - both of which just stood still clawing at the air. This was on two different servers. Every house I explore seems completely empty, there is next to nothing to interact with except for looting bodies (which means nothing because there are no zombies to use the loot against) and opening doors.

I understand I have to eat and drink, but I don't really want to play a game that revolves around wandering aimlessly until I'm thirsty.

I thought maybe the zombies would get more aggressive the more I played, but that makes little sense considering I'm playing on shared servers of 40 people.

Are these just garbage servers? Or is this a common first experience with Dayz?

I fully intend to give it another shot tomorrow, but I'm still just not sure what to expect - if anything. 














 It just seems like a bunch of aimless posts of creepy pictures and 'clever' sayings. 





























 I'm currently watching G-League on the lowest graphics setting and still getting hiccups. I never have issues with any other video or streaming services, but using Twitch is just aggravating. Even switching graphics quality can take 10 minutes with multiple page refreshers because the damn thing doesn't load half the time.

So are there any alternatives for streams outside the Dota client? Or do casters stream solely through Twitch? 




 In this position here: http://imgur.com/mROv9I7

is it a good trade to take the Knight and follow up by taking the other pawn? In other words, is it worth trading my Bishop for a pawn and a Knight?

I rarely play Chess, but over the past week I've been getting hooked, and I've been doing that trade as much as possible, because hey, two pieces for one. But I'm still unsure if the Bishop has equal value to a Knight or not, or if that center pawn is really even that big of a deal early on.

Also if there's a better place for Chess noobs to ask questions, mind directing me there? 









 Hey fitness.

I started running a month and a bit back to get into shape. At first, I would do one hour sessions with great physical difficulty, but no real mental difficulty. However, after the initial 'feel good' of finally getting into exercise wore off, I started to get really bored while running. I used to go just about every day of the week for an hour, now, while I still get out for a run every day, some sessions are as short as 10 minutes. I just start counting the minutes, completely mind numbingly bored. I still look FORWARD to running each day, so my motivation is still there somewhere, it's just when I'm actually on my run that I just want it to end.

Tried listening to music, but I find it gives me headaches having my earphones in for extended periods every damn day, and music isn't really something I can listen to unless I'm in the mood to really get into an album anyway.

tl;dr: Running is boring, how do I keep myself from going braindead through extended sessions. 









 Alien autopsy videos, personal stories, pictures, etc all welcome.

No need to get into much of a debate over whether this stuff is real or not, I don't believe in any of that stuff myself. I'm just interested in seeing what it took others to be convinced. 




 Is there any real need for a cover up? 




 What are the best movies that deal with the possibilities of Alien life? I'm looking for stuff that isn't quite so focused on horror or action, although I wouldn't be against that sort of stuff.

To give an idea, stuff like Contact that deals more with the impact a discovery like that would have on society, or 2001: ASO that keeps the aliens more 'mysterious'. But really, any suggestions are fine. Preferably obscure as I've likely already seen all the bigger stuff. 




 Does music make it easier to get off? 




 The slingshot around the sun to travel time trick: seems relatively simple for what it accomplishes. How did this go unabused throughout all of Trek history, especially from TNG onwards where more powerful ships would be able to achieve the feat even easier. 




 I've read a couple of posts about nerfing Midas considering it's current popularity, but I'd rather not see the item itself get a direct nerf. Instead, how would you feel about the following changes:

* Midas now limited to two per game per team
* Store starts with one Midas
* A new Midas is made available 8 minutes after the first is purchased the first

The effects of the change: No more Midas gaming. You now have to decide which two of your heroes get the benefit of Midas, encouraging more team decision making. Additionally, the timing of your team's first Midas affects how quickly you can get your second Midas, making first Midas timing more crucial.

What other changes could be made instead? Or is Midas overrated and not actually in need of a nerf (just another fad)? 




 I just finished reading this post
http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=132837823

now I've heard of the Deep Web before, but I always just assumed it was nothing more than a general term for website that were overlooked by search engines due to being low priority, however the post has confused my understanding of it.

So what exactly is the 'deep web' and how can I access it? Also, are the claims about the Deep Web in that post accurate? Especially the stuff about being watched by authorities? It makes it sound like every user of the Deep Web is some shady hacker or nutjob who will just randomly aim to ruin my life for simply browsing the web. Like an Internet Cartel or something... 




 So, with all the drama of the Netolic league and previous leagues reportedly not fully paying their casters, item creators or rewards to teams (TPL), I got to wondering what kind of quality control Valve has for tournaments. 

Ticket sales are obviously a huge source of revenue for tournament organizers, so I imagine a lot of this drama would end if Valve were to be a bit harsher on organizers mishandling tournaments. Does anyone know how easy it is to get a tournament ticket into the Valve store and what kind of regulation they have in place? 




 Here's an idea: gems that track records for single games instead of cumulative values. Throw a "Most Last Hits" or "Quickest BattleFury" gem on any of Antimage's items and keep track of your records. If you break your record, it could be informed to everyone on the scoreboard at the end of the game. There are, of course, some obvious downsides such as people deliberately drawing games out in order to beat old records, so maybe some care would have to be taken when selecting types of records to track in order to prevent the system being gamed.

For fun, some more examples:

Weaver: Lowest HP on timelapse

Pudge: Best Hook Hit to Miss Ratio (must throw at least 15 hooks in the game), Most Self Denies

Bounty Hunter: Most track gold

General: Most Kills, Assists, Roshan's, wards placed, etc in a single game, quickest time to hit level 25, least kills in a game you won, Most last hits in first x minutes of game, quickest time to take a tower, quickest time to win a game

and so on. 




 Without spoiling anything other than what I am about to ask, what season do they start appearing on screen? Also do they begin to appear frequently, or is it just the occasional once off? Are the aliens all of the same race? 




 Currently watching Speed Gaming VS DK Game 2 (slight spoilers) and I'm currently looking at 6 Midas' in the game right now.

Why is a 14 minute Midas on Alchemist acceptable in this patch? Why is  Midas a priority for supports instead of quick Mek's? I understand Midas' being more popular in the current patch because higher passive gold means you can reliably get it sooner and more quickly recover your forgone early game after getting a Midas, but is the passive gold gain really enough to explain getting multiple Midas' on the same team and getting Midas' as late as we're seeing?

Are there other aspects of this patch that benefit mass Midas? 




 The wiki page mentions that the PC release date was delayed, but the sidebar doesn't distinguish between PC, PS3 and X360 release dates. Does anyone know if they are the same? 
























 Round 1) An outright no rules street fight. Rocky gets boxing gloves if he wishes and fights in his shorts, the enemy gets whatever weapon they are most synonymous with (Han Solo gets a blaster, Vader gets a lightsaber, etc). Use of The Force is permitted, no vehicles or ships etc.

Round 2) A boxing match. No weapons, boxing gloves are optional.

Round 3) Same as round 1, but with Star Trek characters

Round 4) Same as round 2, but with Star Trek characters

Any Star Wars/Trek character from any canon is permitted. It is peak Rocky and he gets a montage before each fight.

Could he beat Chewbacca? 




 I need to pass a fitness test that requires: 25 pushups, 45 situps and an 8 on the shuttle test score.

I can easily beat the 25 pushups and shuttle run score, but I've never done a situp in my life. I can't even manage one. The form they want you to use is placing your hands on your lower thigh and move them along your leg up to your knee. I can get about 2/3 of the way up there and just can't get any higher. I can't even do one rep. I DO NOT get anyone to hold my feet down, I have to do it unassisted.

I need to be able to pass by the end of the year. What's a good place to start? 




 And if I fail, do I have to pay the full $990 course fee again, or can I just pay to sit the exam? 



















 Where there more people at Wayne Enterprises that new of Batman's identity? What about the military people contracting these designs? Or the people working on parts not made by Wayne Enterprises (perhaps the Batmobile's engine was made by Rolls Royce specifically for that vehicle? They found the wreckage in the tunnel in The Dark Knight and very few large projects like that are all designed by the one company, let alone by a small enough group to keep it all hush hush.

Is Batman being associated with Wayne Enterprises perhaps quite well known and just kept on the down low due to one big non-disclosure agreement? 
























  Last trophy I need for platinum. 




 The difference between just making contact with my body with the ruler and pressing hard in against my 'fat pad' yields and extra half inch. How am I supposed to be doing this? 
























 [This applies to Wiggles canon (TV shows, in character performances, books, etc) and not the irl Wiggles band who fill these roles.]

He stays awake, writing the songs, choreographing the dance moves and  managing the band. It's pretty clear that Murray has no interests outside of screwing around on his guitar, while Anthony is a pure food obsessed hedonist. Greg doesn't seem to have any active interest or hobbies outside of performing at all. So who is the hard worker churning out all those hits? Of course, it's Jeff.

Despite supposedly sleeping all day, he still manages to know all the words, music and moves. Why? Because he wrote it. He wrote all of it. And the rest just piggyback off his success. Not that he cares, everyone seems happy with this arrangement. I mean, how often do you get to sleep on your job without anyone getting angry with you? 









 Woah 














 I have one listed on the Steam market, but no one has bought it (it's been there for a few months). I even keep lowering the price. 







































 It's pretty common to see a King or second to the throne inspiring his troops from the front lines, before leading the soldiers into battle from the head of the pack. Was this common? If not, did it ever happen? How frequently would Kings actually join the fray? 









 Basically, I've been travelling a lot lately and this is the first day I've had to get on the Internet in two weeks, so I haven't kept up to speed with this game. I am about to go without Internet for awhile again in a few hours and I'm thinking of picking up a single player game to kill some time.

So, tl;dr, how crucial is the co-op to fully 'experiencing' this game? Is it like Borderlands, where I can still enjoy it single player, or is it more like Left 4 Dead where the emphasis is on multiplayer? 



















 You can use http://www.redditinvestigator.com/ to find out. I'm not sure how accurate it is, but I'm pretty sure it's right in my case. 




 A lot of good suggestions are making it to the front page today, so I thought I'd take a moment to suggest something I think Dota has needed for a long time: heroes should fart when they die. 

Honestly, I fully expected to have this feature by the time the game got out of beta, but that felt like a lifetime ago now. I think this should be added before TI5 as a priority feature, but they'll need to start ASAP if they're going to get all the VA's in to record farts for their characters in time. 


































 Firstly, these videos probably covered a wide time range as I've seen many posted, and it's been awhile since I've watched them so my specifics might be wrong.

At any rate, it was interesting to watch them because they often involved a lot of disarming and grappling. Was the common soldier trained in these techniques and if so, did they translate well into actual battles? Or was it more for 1v1 sparring and showfights? Kind of like how you learn a lot of advanced martial arts techniques, but when an actual fight breaks out you'll probably just use a basic grapple and pummel your opponent anyway? 









 Just want to know if I should buy now or hold out for a GOTY edition down the track. 




 Also if it's the latter, and my Plus subscription ends, do I get them back if I renew? What about save game progress and trophies? 
























 Is there a strict definition for what guides Vulcan logic? 




 Or to suggest that overly sexist and objectifying portrayals increases the average males perception or treatment of women?

Because at the moment it just makes me think of many other arguments from the past: violent videogames will increase crime (they didn't, and crime is at a low while violent games are at their most gory), heavy metal music will lead to Satanism (completely debunked), rise of availability of porn will lead to increased rape (no correlation has been shown, let alone a link).

What exactly are SJWs using as a basis for their beliefs that sexy videogame girls = increased sexism in society or violence towards women in videogames will lead to actual violence committed towards women.

It seems to me like average living conditions in a country, religiousness and experience with women on a day to day basis all seem like they'd be better predictors of sexism and ill treatment of women than fucking videogames. (everyone plays videogames these days too, more people than ever, so it's certainly not an exposure issue. Previous generations who don't play games seem more sexist?). However, even this is just speculation, so to avoid sounding hypocritical: I have no idea what factors influence sexism. But I certainly don't see any reason to believe videogames are any more responsible than any other factor at the moment.

Feel free to prove me wrong. 




 Excluding trade spam rooms of course. 














 Rules: Each round takes place in a standard wrestling cage. There is no escape and nowhere to hide, nor are there any weapons. Each fighter is in a pair of boxers, no equipment, no armour, just pure brutal fisticuffs. Force to die or concede wins. Geralt gets potions beforehand.

Round 1: Geralt vs Spock
Round 2: Geralt vs Batman
Round 3: Spock vs Batman 




 And what about this very question? Is this 'listable'? 




 I've never hit level cap in an MMORPG before, but I think this might be the first one I manage to do it in. My question is: What is there to do at that point? What exactly does an MMORPGs endgame involve? Constantly fighting the same bosses over and over again for the chance of slightly better equipment is how I picture MMORPG endgame to work, is this at all accurate? 



















 I just thought it would be funny to watch it from that perspective. A movie about Jim Carrey freaking out over nothing for an hour and a half, then walking out of a door in the ocean.

And all the in universe advertisements (like Marlon drinking his beer slowly in front of the camera) and things like the looping pedestrians/cyclists around his neighbourhood would look ridiculous.
Please tell me an edit like this exists.

**TL;DR: Is there an edit of the Truman Show that removes all references to Truman being in a television show, because that'd be boss** 




 Batman got absolutely stomped in the first fight, but in the second fight he seems to win pretty handedly. It's even at first, but towards the end Batman is shitstomping Bane. Why was the matchup suddenly so even between them at first, and could Batman have continued to keep up and even win without damaging his mask?

Scene for reference [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxqC9LyNo-0)

Also not sure if this entirely counts as on topic for this sub, or if it belongs in another sub. 









 The more obscure the better as I've probably played most games you're about to suggest. Preferably PC, but suggestions from any console is fine. 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y13cES7MMd8#t=50 














 I'm really curious to know what Valve's intentions for it are. 














 And how it will work. Hopefully cosmetic stuff works like L4D2 and doesn't require you to play on a special server. This pretty much killed workshop for KF1 for me. 




 By 'proper' I guess I mean something with some actual depth and story or gameplay mechanics akin to a typical PC or console game. Something that doesn't rely on Internet access, purchases to continue playing, etc.

I know both XCOM and some Final Fantasy games are available, but I've played them all to death in the past. 




 And would I likely get banned? I've always entertained the idea of making a novelty account to collect celebrities opinions on my dick, but would they even see it? Would I likely just get downvoted and banned? Would it count as sexual harrasment/illegal (I wouldn't trick them, I'd be straight up like "Here's my dick, what do you think of it Mr. Musk?")

Even if I only got one in every 20 celebs to reply it'd be worth it. 




 Preferably an action RPG, but anything will do. Something that gives you good control over your stats and ability progression and have the choices actually matter.

Thanks!

Edit: Preferably a little less mainstream. Great suggestions so far, but I have played most of them already! 




 So basically, I'm having trouble getting my speakers to split the sound correctly. I have them all plugged in and they all produce sound, but only for the Left and Right sounds when I run tests. 

[So in reference to this image](http://i.imgur.com/T1yswxO.png), when I run the test, it first tests the left speakers. The speaker that should produce a sound here does. However, so does the center speaker, and the rear left and right speakers. During the test of the right speaker, again, rear left, rear right and the center speaker all produce sounds alongside the right speaker.

It then runs tests for the center speakers, rear speakers and sub - all of which produce no sound from any speaker.

Basically, left and right speaker are working as intended, but all remaining speakers seem to just play both the left and right sounds.

I've clearly set this up wrong somehow. Can anyone walk me through how to fix this? Thanks in advance!

 Firstly, I am Australian, and am assuming most first would countries have similar standards for leave and sick days.

Secondly, referring to CEOs of large multimillion dollar companies.

So yeah, what do their basic 'employee contract' look like in concern to days off? What happens if they call in sick but they're seen at the beach or something? 














 What's it like to have to date/be intimate with people you don't find physically attractive (due to your own limited options)? I can't imagine what it'd be like to have to 'settle'. Do you just overcome it and focus 100% on personality (to me, both looks and personality matter) or do you just partner up out of fear of being alone? HAVE you even managed to have relationships?

Do you feel self conscious all the time? Do you think it's impacted job opportunities? Friendships?

Is it a self imposed unnatractiveness (refusal to workout, etc) or did you just lose the genetic lottery?

TL;DR: How has being ugly affected your life? How do you deal with it? 




 Long story short, started with a Sorcerer build, used Soul Vessel to rebuild into Dex build for new game plus, have 12 Int and Attunement points pushing my soul level up that do nothing. Is there an item I can use to reduce them? I vaguely recall being able to do it in Demon's Souls. 




 Resident Evil 4 was the last RE game I really, really enjoyed. RE5 was good a single playthrough and messing around with a bit of co-op, it was a good game, but it was really where the series started to nosedive. I decided to give Resident Evil 6 and Revelations a shot, but they just bored me to tears. Is the series dead for good? 




 Title says it all. 




 Anything to keep an eye out for? Any must get boss soul weapons/armour? 




 All of the most frequent guests on QI get into an all out fight at the pub over some trivial fact in dispute. Who is the last one standing? This brawl also includes a wildcard, which will be explained below.

The 'contestants' are:

-Stephen Fry

-Alan Davies

-Bill Bailey

-Jo Brand

-Phill Jupitus

-Jimmy Carr

-Sean Lock

-Rich Hall

-David Mitchell

-Clive Anderson

-Rob Brydon

-Sandi Toksvig

-Wildcard (you may add on guest from the remaining guests who have appeared on QI from [this list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QI#Guest_appearances) if you wish).

**ROUNDS**

1) The all out brawl. Who wins? Who is dead last? What about a ranking from first to last?

2) Who was likely the most drunk?

3) Who most likely instigated the argument? 




 I noticed the store page lists ST:O has having Steam achievements. Where can I actually see these? 



















 They got less fun every year, and now we're reduced to a simple badge crafting. I know most people don't pay attention to them, but I think they're a nice touch of fun and fanfare, especially when they introduced unique cosmetics for games like Dota 2 into them last time. 




 This is currently being promoted in a giveaway thread on pcmasterrace: http://dimmdrive.com/

What does it actually do and why would I want to use it? 




 It's in a regular fist fight. No weapons or significant environmental features. Who is the strongest person current Alec Baldwin could beat? What about in his prime? 









 I bought a business and noticed I had only received income from it once over several days of play. At this rate, I don't feel like it will ever pay itself off. Definitely not before I finish story mode. 




 Basically, I remember getting this error about a week after I first got my PS4 and having to fiddle with the network settings for hours. I am getting it again now when trying to access the store any other PSN features. However, I was not getting it at the start of the current attacks, it only started yesterday.

So I'm wondering, is this just coincidental timing with the error returning, or are other users getting this error?

Edit: Australian, if that matters. 




 Again, not trolling, some people may interpret this as a jab at the game. I'm genuinely interested. Is there a breakdown of the costs anywhere? Does that 200 million include marketing costs or a fat paycheck for licensing? Maybe they absorbed engine development costs into it (assuming they built an engine instead of licencing it)?

Where did the money go precisely? 









 Anyone else having issues with this? Doesn't seem to appear in big picture or regular Steam. 




 An ultimate, with a suitably long cooldown (perhaps the longest in the game), that could reverse time by 3/3.5/4 seconds? Everything would be returned to the state the game was in several seconds ago (with the one exception being this ultimate is placed on cooldown).

Aghanim's Scepter allows you to rewind time while dead. 




 Particularly, actual expansions with new quests etc?

I was kind of disappointed to see Dark Souls 2 release three expansions AND a 'remastered' edition within the first year of its release, I regret not just waiting and getting the definitive version. What are the odds of The Witcher 3 taking the same path? Should I pre-order or wait a year or so for a 'complete' version to come out? 




 Are photos like this touched up?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carina_Nebula#mediaviewer/File:One_Picture,_Many_Stories.jpg

Or are there actually places like this I can visit and see the night that bright? Particularly, the bright red center nebula and the glowing blue and purple stars/galaxies scattered throughout.

What about space photos like this:

I get that nothing is faked, but MOST of that colour is outside of the visible light spectrum right? What would that look like to the human eye? Just black? 




 What are the big teams? The big strats/heroes? Any 'must watch' games from the past few months? 









 Also, does the customs counter in the records page only include the ones you have unlocked? 









 So I've got a pair of Sennheiser HD598s playing both through my PC and iPhone. I'm jumping back and forth between two tracks. One is a 320kpbs track ripped from a videogame. It's the original source file so you can bet it's high quality. The other is a 192kbps mp3 copy of it.

I'm failing to notice a difference between the two tracks, except that one is half the filesize. If I shuffle them and close my eyes, I can't tell which is which. Are my ears simply not good enough? My equipment? Why do people care so much about filetype and bitrate if not? Or do some songs simply compress better than others for whatever reason?

Educate me here audiophiles! 




 Unfortunately neither game seems to have Australian based servers, and I can't be bothered trying to PvP with lag. 




 I haven't played in awhile, but noticed today I am getting bullet bills in the middle of the pack and far more frequent 'good' items. I recently got a blue shell in second place. What is happening? 




 So I was posting on 4chan and (obviously) noticed that have a new captcha where I just have to press a checkbox to prove I am not a robot. How does this work?

I'm guessing users who pass enough captchas get this status, but if that's the case, why do I have to check a box at all? 




 I have a Gateway 3DS if that matters. I am just sick of grinding custom moves on the Wii U and wouldn't mind getting them all unlocked on my 3DS so I can transfer character sets over to the WiiU.

Thanks in advance! 









 What are the typical mistakes in this bracket? What roles should I learn to see the greatest progress? Is it better to play a farming game or an aggression game in this bracket (solo queue). Any guides specifically for this MMR range?

I know it's an awful vague question, but it's kind of hard to improve when I mostly play with people at my skill level (most of my friends are 2.5k MMR). 




 So who was right and about what in this video?

 What are the odds of items dropping? Do I have to just own the Arcana in my inventory or do I need to have it equipped? Does it have to be the PA Arcana? 









 While I'm at it: why was this solution so difficult to come up with? 









 Is it possible to get Druid's bear to stand next to his effigy, and get Druid in bear form? If not... can we have this please Valve? 














 I get an hour or two of cardio each week (15-25 minutes of jump rope most days of the week) and lift a bit of weights to keep some muscle definition.

My usual diet is stuff like chicken/beef stir fry (usually noodles over rice, since it reheats better), chicken or ham wraps/rolls, veggies (usually potato, carrot and broccoli), eggs, hamburgers (homemade) and occasionally red meat like sausages/chops. For breakfast: cereals like Wheat Biscuits, oats, cornflakes and Just Right with fruit once or twice a day (usually apple or banana). Occasionally soups and when I have toast (with eggs) it's wholemeal.

I usually just prepare all my lunches for the week (so one week might be wraps, next week stir fry, next week rolls/sandwiches) so it is a pretty static diet.

Now, the bad things. Once a week I'll usually have either takeout (KFC being my most common, usually a burger, a few pieces of chicken and a water instead of soft drink, followed by pizza, which I absolutely gorge on (I'm not overweight, but I freaking love pizza) and something like apple pie with cream once or so a week.

I can identify that this is a generally healthy lifestyle, but a close family member recently passed away from a heart attack which has me on full paranoia mode. Am I one day going to regret a couple of desserts and weekly takeout, or am I overexaggerating the effects of these bad foods?

Also, is there a better sub to ask this on? I thought of r/fitness, but I thought maybe they'd be more concerned with muscle gain than general health. 









 I finished the game in Grounded (first playthrough). I want to go back and finish it in Grounded + to get all the + trophies, but I also want the fully upgrade/shiv door trophies, which I don't think there is enough materials to get.

Is it possible to go Grounded  Easy + (get the upgrades and collectibles trophies)  Grounded + (for remaining + trophies) all with the one 'Joel'? Or can I only go down difficulties when starting a plus mode?

 For example.

Phone rings

Hello, this is test_subject5355

Hi NS, this is Blank from Blank Inc., how are you today?

I'm good thanks

Now at this point, I usually just stop speaking. However, I noticed that sometimes there's an awkward pause. So I figured I'm doing it wrong and started sayings

I'm good thanks, and you?

Now all 3 times I did this, the person on the other end let out a light laugh. All 3 times. It might be because of how unconfidently I said it or am I not supposed to say that?

This question is probably pretty ridiculous, but I just feel like an anxious mess when using phones (talking over people, awkward silences, so forth) so maybe I'm overanalysing, but I don't know what I'm doing so I thought I may as well ask. 














 I just bought a PS4 and I have an old PS3 account that I forgot the password/DOB to. I contacted Sony support and sent passport for ID and they should be able to give me a new password. 

Anyway, I was wondering if I avoid online features and play games on the default account without creating a PSN account (User1 I think it is) and unlock trophies, can I sync those trophies with my PSN account once I get the password? Or will I have to start again?

Basically:
-Have old PS3 account
-Have PS4
-Unlocked trophies on PS4 profile that currently isn't associated with PSN
-What happens if I associate my old PS3 account with my PS4 profile on PSN? 









 I haven't really been watching lately, has 6.82 had any major impact on picks/strats? 




 Seems to be particularly common in chunks of chicken from stir fries. 









 Just curious, I went through my old family computer and I found a bunch of flash games (Stick RPG, Sinjid: Shadow of the Warrior) that I downloaded years ago. I started playing them again and all my save data is still there. It got me wondering where this data is stored. I'm playing them through Internet Explorer. Is it all stored in my IE cache (as if I was playing them online) or within the .swf? I thought it was kind of nifty going back through this stuff and want to back it up for memories sake, it feels strangely good in a nostalgic way to go through all this old stuff.
Thanks!

 I'm guessing it's because they're more reliable and will generally be better actors, but it always feels really weird. I often watch these movies assuming they're adult learners at small time colleges/unis before someone mentions that they're in high school or something.

It's particularly common in the horror genre. 














 I think this would be a great change. Valve's free to play model should extend to the store itself. Every game sold on Steam should become free to play, and Valve can support it by selling hats for your Steam profile pictures.

Hats could be purely cosmetic, or they can go the TF2 route and make hats 'sidegrades'.

Imagine:

**The Time Saver**

* +35% load time on the Steam store

* -15% quality of images


**The Merchant's Monocle**

* 5% better prices on the Steam market

* Maximum of 10 market purchases allowed a day


**Santa's Christmas Hat**

* +40% chance to receive drops while browsing the Steam store or playing Steam games during Christmas Day

* -75% relationship with your family


I for one think it would be an amazingly profitable venture for Steam, as well as benefiting all Steam users who can now play games as they please.

What other interesting hats would you like to see? 














 In my case, I just got offered a job working 7am to 7pm two days, then 12am to 7am two days with four days off. It basically just rotates like that non stop. While I think I'm capable of doing this and still maintaining a solid 6-8 hours of sleep a night, I was wondering if it would cause health issues?

I really want the job as it would work well with Uni since I'd get four days off back to back frequently to study/classes/assignments despite it being a full time paying job.

Will this be a health issue? What if I only did it for a year or two? 




 I'll keep things brief. I'm looking for a job relevant to my degree. I have taken a full time job in the mean time. They think I'm going to be here for years, I'm just treating it as a temporary job. I have applied for new jobs since then. Odds are, I'll get a smattering of interviews at random times throughout the coming months (not in one big block), so I can't just keep booking sick days or taking random time off throughout the day and my lunch breaks are only 30 minutes.

I have no leave accrued because I've only been working this job for a few days.

What do I do? I feel really trapped in this poor paying job with bad conditions and no career progressions, but I can't quit (financial reasons) and can't find a way to attend interviews for better jobs. 




 Do Americans know who the "Bananas in Pyjamas" are? 




 Is there any specific reason the games on Steam are being released in this order? Will we likely see all Final Fantasy games come to Steam (7, then 8, then 3, then 4, then 13)? It makes it seem like they don't ever intend to release 9, 10 or 5?

Also what are the odds of getting these games? Is there some reason we didn't get 9 after 8? The only reason I can think of for not getting 10 is because of the HD remake recently.

Particularly, will we likely see IX, X and XIII's sequels? 









 OK, so I have these very vague images in my head of a game I played when I was younger. I sincerely doubt anyone will be able to help me as I can't even hold the images in my head very well. But here we go anyway.

It was a PC game, I played it in the mid to late 90s. It was a first person game and I believe it involved you exploring a cave or something. I think early on you get attacked by a bat or some sort of flying creature. I can't remember if it was an FPS or not, but I think it might have been 'on rails' and had cinematic style graphics... I think.

I really can't remember anything else. May or may not have been set on another planet (it involved a lot of alien enemies).

Is there a thorough database somewhere I could peruse to maybe remember a bit better? 

Thanks.

Platform(s): PC

Genre: Unknown

Estimated year of release: 1990-2000

Graphics/art style: I think it was a combination of real life footage and animated? Or maybe entirely 2D. It had a 'realistic' look to it.

Notable characters: None

Notable gameplay mechanics: None

Other details: I don't remember anything :(

 Why did we 'invent' capital letters? When did they first appear and how else have they been used throughout history (now, usually for proper nouns and the starts of sentences along with some other niche uses)?

 I was just thinking, something that has helped me deal with my anxiety over the years is forcing myself into increasingly uncomfortable situations until I adjust to it. However, having the Internet has allowed me to avoid many things that could have served as a great means to overcome my anxiety much quicker (mostly to do with human interaction: leaving the house to shop, talk to salespeople, phone calls, etc).

Do you think a rise in Internet availability could be linked with a rise in anxiety? I know it's hard to judge this sort of thing since mental orders in general change their definitions over the years and reporting on the whole is on a rise (people more accepting about or it aware of it).

Is there any research done on this potential link?

 I just finished Chapter 3 and I haven't even finished the first day yet. I've done all the sidemissions that popped up (they felt scarce, tbh) and collected a fair amount of stuff. I remember feeling really pressed for time to do much in the original Dead Rising, but I'm just breezing through this one. I'll be finished well and truly before the six day mark.

Does Chapter progress slow down at all soon - or side mission frequency increase?

 What was he supposed to do? Get out and challenge them to fisticuffs one at a time? What if he doesn't stand a chance at winning, or they gang up on him?

OK, so that's a bad idea. Well... drive away? Wait, they're surrounding me, I might bump into them. "Sorry Mr. Drunk Asshole, I'll put the car in park and let you ruin me financially and destroy my livelihood"

How about the third solution. Oh wait there isn't one. I guess we'll let violent people just walk all over us.

What's your solution exactly? I'd like to hear it. 




 I might be thinking of a different, similar video, but weren't these people charge with battery? 




 All you have to do is make more money of the DRM than you would have if you didn't include it. Let's simplify and say that including DRM has the following associated costs (we'll ignore 'brand damage', like people not buying future games, and other costs for simplicities sake):

-Development costs of the DRM: $500
-Lost sales due to customers disliking DRM: $250
-DLC sales lost from unhappy customers: $100
-People returning the game because DRM prevents if from playing: $100
Loss: $950

However, by preventing the game from being torrentable immediately, a small fraction of people who were on the fence about torrenting vs buying now cave in and buy the game. If these people's sales exceed $950, the DRM is worth it. Furthermore, the DRM might be developed for one game, but used for future games, meaning including it in future titles won't even cost the full $500.

Having said that, the data isn't usually as clear cut (hard to quantify gained sales vs lost sales for including DRM, for example). However, I think it's fair to say that these companies have some reasonable data supporting their decisions. I'm not entirely convinced that DRM is 'useless' like most people seem to think. It might be, but the mere fact that companies, with access to way more data about their products than us, are so adamant about using it leads me to believe that there must be some argument for it. Or maybe it is costing them money and they just don't have the data to realise it.

The point is, whether it's actually good or not isn't just a simple case of "people hate it" or "it'll get cracked anyway".

Another pro-DRM argument is maybe the technology is costing them money on products sold today. But maybe they're just using today's products as guinea pigs to make better DRM for a future generation. 




 Sad and lonely, sure. I think it's missing the 'crazy' criteria. 




 Insurance rates are determined by looking at your background and comparing it to statistical info to find a marketable price point that will yield the greatest profit (the goal of any product, really).

So if you have a heart condition, you are obviously more likely to require medical treatment for a heart condition, so it's a bigger risk to them to offer you insurance, hence it costs more. I'm sure you already knew that though.

Makes sense right?

Well, gender has been show to play a huge role in the number of accidents you have.

Men are more likely to be involved in dangerous car crashes, usually where the driver is at fault. However, these don't often result in insurance claims (I don't think?) and are not as numerous as small crashes. On the other hand, women are much more likely to be involved in small crashes that result in insurance payouts.

Hence, women are more expensive to provider coverage for.

I've seen a lot of people complain about this being unfair, but it makes sense to me. If you cover 100 men and 100 women on the same rates, the group of women is going to cost you a lot more.

(I'll just note by saying I've never read the studies this info is based on myself, but I've never heard anyone criticise them so I've always assumed they must be pretty solid and still up to date). 




 You're preaching to the choir. 




 Do homeopaths believe that you can get drunk off a single drop of alcohol in a glass of water? Also does it have to be water? Could I dilute medicine inside milk?

Or vice versa, could I put a drop of milk into water and 'increase' the amount of fats/protein/etc my body gets out of it? Or does it only work with curing things?

Finally, only liquids? Or can I put one part of say, sleeping gas, inside a bag with a ton of 'regular air' and knock myself out?

Basically, what decides what can be diluted and still effective and what can't?

(No, I'm not suggesting homeopathy actually works. I know it's quack medicine. I'm just more interested in what THEY believe). 




 He's probably a virgin. 




 I think I was one of the few people that really liked the Steam Workshop. It was actually a selling point that convinced me to buy several games instead of pirate. I can't believe they just monetized community mods. I'm fucking done. Pirating every single player game from here on out. 




 Yeah, I tried restarting about 5 times to no avail. Can only seem to find non-Australian servers or play solo. 




 I think it's fine for balance reasons, but it just feels weird. More like the button is unresponsive rather than that it's too slow for balance purposes. I'd like to see them tweak animations and speed to make it fill a bit more natural. 




 I had no problem playing the game yesterday, but now when I press the matchmaking button it just does nothing.

I can't use the server browser either because there does not seem to be any servers under 100 ping (I live in remote Australia). The matchmaking games I found yesterday all had under 100 ping though. 




 I'm sure Tripwire appreciate any feedback, even if it something they ultimately decide will stay regardless of opinions.

I'd rather let people voice their opinions here freely then let you decide what does and doesn't qualify as a viable complaint/reddit thread. 




 For example, someone causes me to suffer an injury and a costly hospital bill. I take out money of a large interest account, and sue the party. It takes years to get that money back. I win the case and get the lump sum to cover my medical bill. Do I also get the interest I could have earned had the money remained in my account for a longer period?

What about lost opportunities (like using that money to buy a cheap house)?

 Probably because OP didn't ask why it is the way it is. 














 But why not just use historical data to determine better wait times? For example, if after 12pm, on average, each patient is waiting for 20 minutes, then book the first patient after 12pm twenty minutes later than usual to 'fix' the accrued wait differences due to the compounded late patients.

It seems like all the data to cut down wait times should be available. 




 Edit: so HARD for them to estimate wait times 




 There just seem to be a lot of them.

 While other people's answers are more on point, in general, it's just as easy to pirate anything. The vast majority of videogames have the same low quality piracy checks.

 If it's a film based camera (not digital) and someone takes a photo with it, wouldn't you be the owner of the physical film? What if the camera was stolen to take the picture? You own the film that the image is printed on, but the shooter owns the rights to the image?

What if they take a photo with my camera (digital) and I refuse to give it to them to get 'their' property off it? Can I delete the photo if they have no copies?

What if I let them use my camera, they take an awesome picture and show it to them (still on the camera) to a third party who wants to purchase it for $200. Can I delete the picture before they copy it to a PC in this instance? Or would I owe $200?

 I made [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1tsmsv/sherlock_holmes_gregory_house_and_adrian_monk/) a bit over a year ago. I've decided to redo it, but with some changes, as there were some flaws with it last time.

The contestants this time will be: 

* **Ambrose Monk** replacing Adrian Monk. He is to Adrian what Mycroft is to Sherlock. However, after working closely with a psychologist, he has beaten most of his major issues and is able to compete on Jeopardy with minimal hassle.

* **Gregory House**, however he is fully motivated to win at all costs.

* **Sherlock Holmes** - specifically, the Sherlock from the BBC adaption, enabling him to level the playing field by not being at a 100 year disadvantage.
* **Batman** - Generic Batman
* **Adam West Batman** - From the 60s live action Batman.
* **Shawn Spencer** from the television show Psych.

What order does each contestant come in in the following rounds:

Round 1: Ambrose vs House vs Holmes

Round 2: Batman vs Adam West Batman vs Shawn

Round 3: The winner from each round faces off

Bonus Round: The audience votes for a their favourite contestant. Who most likely wins the audience over with their overall performance, personality and banter with Trebek.

There is no cheating (no, Batman doesn't get the answers beforehand with prep time). It's a legit contest and assume everyone is motivated to win. Because reasons. 














 From wiki:

The value of Finnegans Wake as a work of literature has been a point of contention since the time of its appearance, in serial form, in literary reviews of the 1920s. Initial response, to both its serialised and final published forms, was almost universally negative. Even close friends and family were disapproving of Joyce's seemingly impenetrable text, with Joyce's brother Stanislaus "rebuk[ing] him for writing an incomprehensible night-book",[198] and former friend Oliver Gogarty believing the book to be a joke

 No ratings system to help filter quality stages from the rest, no search by author so talented stage creators can easily share there work. There aren't even shareable codes for stages.

Anyone else disappointed in this regard?

 The bomb is a special bomb that can only be disarmed with doubles. The 4chan user has no doubles currently on him so he has to get doubles of his own. He uses a nearby laptop to attempt to get the doubles. The laptop comes pre-equipped with 4chan's homepage already loaded and several hundred Christian Bale pictures.

His board of choice, but he must balance the odds of a slow board not being anywhere near doubles (and considering post restrictions) vs the difficulty of timing dubs on a fast board.

Can he do it in time?

 I'm applying for some part time work and stumbled upon a few jobs by this title. Hours look really good to suit Uni, but I'm not entirely sure what it actually involves. Some of the position descriptions include activities such as:

 All aspects of merchandising for leading magazines publishers

 Ensuring products receive the maximum benefit of promotional activity with effective product placement and visual displays using provided point of sale

 Maintaining authorised planogram compliance and stock replenishment

 Reporting on competitor activity

Does it involve sales of some sort? Because I'd be terrible at that. Is it just stocking shelves in Supermarkets? Any insight here? 




 I've always known it as a class in Final Fantasy, but it's also the title given to one of the characters in Game of Thrones. Where did the term originate from? 




 This might belong on Out of the Loop, because I just plain and simply don't know much about this shit. Also I understand that the goals of the people... attacking videogames (???) are not necessarily consistent.

But as a general rule of thumb, what are the main changes they want to see in the videogaming world? Like, if we all 'surrendered' and they typed up a list of demands to be immediately actioned, what would that list include? 









 Is there a directory or database of doctors that I have to register through? How do THEY check that I'm licenced? Or is it as simple as applying to a hospital, getting some friends to act as references and getting a job like any other?

 Cosmic turtle is canon? 




 From this page:

"Sony no longer produces an annual report."

Do they have any reporting requirements enforced by law? Can a public company just withhold it's information like that? What if shareholders want audited financial statements? 














 Instead of always trying to steal one why doesn't he just buy one and learn the secret forumula?

 These characters attempt to prank one another. They have one year to pull off their prank and may execute at any time throughout the year. Who pulls off the greater prank?

Round 1) Batman vs Spiderman

Round 2) Jar Jar Binks vs Yoda

Round 3) Spock vs Data

Round 4) Goku vs Superman

Round 5) Bruce Almighty vs The Mask (Carrey's)

Round 6) Bill Gates vs Steve Jobs (era: 2005)


Bonus Round: Can George Taylor prank back the Planet of the Apes? Assuming he attempts to do so from the end of the first movie (so the sequels have yet to happen) with one year prep time.

 The Chosen Undead (Dark Souls), Bearer of the Curse (Dark Souls 2), The Hunter (Bloordborne) and the playable character from Demon's Souls enter a round robin tournament. Who wins?

You may build these characters anyway, with any weapons, based on the following restrictions:

Round 1) Starting classes only.

Round 2) Level 60 (distribute how you wish)

Round 3) All skills at their hard caps

Who is the ultimate winner? 




 I know it's probably too early, but I'm willing to accept speculation. Basically, I'm hoping to buy one in November as a Christmas present for my brother. However, as I live outside of the US, I will pretty much need to buy it ASAP in order for it to get here in time.

So: thoughts on it's viability as a controller in each genre? I'm most dubious about FPS games. Seems like it would be great for third person games.

What about stuff like Civ V? Would it actually be comfortable for extended periods?

RTS/MOBA are the only genre I'd immediately rule out having not used one. 




 Stemming from this discussion [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/30t18v/why_enterprise_is_getting_another_look_and_why/)

It seems a lot of people did not appreciate how much Voyager jumped the shark and filled the Universe with too much overpowered technology that would limit any Trek's set post-Voyager.

The show is also often cited as being one of the low points in the franchise.

So what if it was officially de-canonised and a new Trek took it's place taking place after Deep Space 9? Would you be interested in seeing this happen? 









 I don't know why this sub requires it to be mandatory I supply text here since my thread does not need more than the title in the first place, so here is some text - and now I have to wait 10 minutes to make my post again because of this pointless rule. 
























 Tried in home streaming and the lag was awful. Would upgrading my router (it's an entirely wireless connection, btw) be the best way to resolve this? What are other major factors that would affect in home streaming? 









 I'm wondering if I should commit to just fully upgrading my Kirkhammer, or should I hold onto some resources for later weapons? I'm trying to go for a simple Vit/Strength build for my first playthrough (with a little stamina thrown in). 




 I've tried both servers and the ping is pretty bad. Have any Australian players found a solution? Is there any possibility of getting SEA servers at some point in the near future?

From what I've played, this game looks pretty enjoyable, but the ping is a huge turn off. 









 Referring to the US.

It's illegal to hire a prostitute for sex, however it IS legal to hire an actor to have sex with someone else for the production of pornography.

So could four people (we'll say M1, M2, W1 and W2) get around prostitution laws by paying eachother off to make porn?

For example, M1 can't hire W1 as a prostitute. However, he could agree to hire W2 to have sex with M2 and request they film it (and upload the video to the Internet to fully ensure it's purpose as porn, even if it's to a deliberately small and unadvertised website) and in return M2 pays W1 to do the same for M1. M1 and M2 work for free.

Technically it'd just be porn, but the effect is just basic prostitution (providing you're willing to let the video go on the net).

Could you take it a step further and have 'brothels' that match participants for them, acting as an Agent on their behalf, and even include a service to blue the faces? If that's too much hassle, just use really, really low quality film and remove the sound?

To summarise: people basically just hire prostitutes for eachother and call it porn. 




 Daily? Weekly? Monthly? I guess it would vary pretty wildly, so I'll ask the question for two broad categories and accept generalised answers:

A) Famous porn stars. One's many people would know
B) The 'average' porn star

Is it common for people to just do it once or twice and never again? Do most pornstars do it as their primary job or 'on the side' for some extra dosh? 









 And does he do anything else other than stand there? Sounds like an amazing job. 




 New to the game, my weapons are starting to feel really outdated and I'm not getting any good mod drops.

I've got blueprints for a Grakata and Heat Sword just sitting there ready to go, all but for 2 neurodes and a neural sensor. Where can I get these items ASAP? I've done the first two missions on Jupiter (first + Io) and found none as well as no neurode drops on Earth.

Why can't I seem to find any? They just drop from enemies right? 














 Three handicapped, but otherwise perfectly identical Batman's all face up against one another. Each has a unique handicap that will inhibit them in the fight. You may choose any Batman from any continuity or just answer for Batman in general since it's a larger generalisable answer between Batmen anyway.

Each Batman has a handicap: one Batman is missing a single arm (at the shoulder), another is missing a single leg (at the hip) and the third is missing both eyes, but has all limbs intact.

No gadgets that can overcome their handicaps can be used (robot limbs,  sonar replacing his eyes, etc).

**RULES**

-ALL ROUNDS ARE ROUND ROBIN STYLE TOURNAMENTS (three 1v1's as opposed to a single 1v1v1).

-NO PREP TIME IN ANY ROUND. They're thrown right in only finding out who their foe is at the last second.

-No leaving the warehouse

**Round 1:** Hand to hand combat with NO GADGETS. Takes place in an empty warehouse.

**Round 2:** Basic gadgets are allowed. The standard arsenal of Batman minus access to vehicles (so no remote controlling the Batmobile in to run the other Batman over). Takes place in standard warehouse.

**Round 3:** A large warehouse filled with crates, shipping containers and rafters. Completely dark, no lighting, emphasizing Stealth. Each Batman may use gadgets batarangs, grappling hooks and smoke pallets.

**Key**

Just to prevent confusion...

One legged Batman will be referred to as 1L.

One armed = 1A

No eyes = NE 









 It seems after Chappie opinions regarding the Blomdog have shifted a little around here. Are you still excited for Blommer's Alien movie? Do you think he has was it takes to pull it off, so to speak? 




 Their only option is to shoot one or the other with a potentially lethal shot (no time to close in as they are about to stab eachother in the heart). 




 Let's say Bill Clinton goes to stay at Obama's place to play videogames and have pizza all night. Each President is assigned mandatory security, so what happens in this scenario? Does Obama's guard just look after Clinton for the night, or does Clinton's security tag along? 




 I'm just going to rattle off some questions here that I'm curious about concerning the President's occupation of the White House...

1) When the President moves out, can he take any furniture with him? Does the new President inherit the furniture? What about stuff like mattresses and linen?

2) How much of the White House is the President's personal living space? I mean, does he have a garage he can go mess around in that no one else can enter? A loungeroom? Or is it like living with a ton of roommates all day?

3) Does the President get private Internet access? Can he watch porn with no one knowing?

4) What about buying personal things he might not want others to see? How does the First Lady buy lingerie? Sex toys? Etc?

5) Can the President choose to redecorate at will? What if he buys a new couch with his own money for the White House loungeroom? Does he get to take it with him when he leaves? What happens to the old one in the mean time?

6) Is there a White House landlord? Can the Pres make renovations as he wants? Or put in a new hook to hang a picture? Is he personally liable if he breaks something? 




 Also how likely would some sort of aircraft be at sneaking a nuke into the opposing country and dropping it manually?

Just how good are their anti-nuke defenses? 




 Alien can be any character from any franchise not born on Earth or part of the human species (so Thor would count, as he was not born on Earth). It also counts interdimensional beings and Gods, etc.

Round 1) It's a 'fist fight' on a football field. Contestants are not allowed their weapons (unless it's part of them).

Round 2) The alien is hunting Duke on the Nostromo. The strongest alien contender in this round can be no bigger than three times a the Xenomorph from the first Alien movie in order for it to move about the ship. Duke gets any and all weapons - but will risk structural damage by using them, as well as use of any of the equipment aboard the Nostromo.

Round 3) On an open field like round 1, but both sides get their equipment (whatever gear is typical of the alien and any weapon Duke has used).

 For further clarification: if we measured some quantum interaction and rewound time to observe the interaction again, would it play out the exact same? Or, because it's truly random, could something completely different happen? 




 I'm just wondering what Steam Link actually does and what kind of equipment I need to minimise lag. I don't really have much of a home network beyond a cheap router and a PC. What exactly are the requirements for a good Steam Link connection? It performance dependent on my router?

Also I'm assuming the Steam Controller will use bluetooth? The only thing I have tried in this regards with my PC is a DS4 control, which had huge input lag. What is most likely to cause this issue (so I can get whatever gear is needed for Steam Link's release)? The DS4 or my Bluetooth dongle?

 **Gabe, the Trickster**
 
 **Lore**: Some shitty mage who got off on playing a lot of tricks on people. Eventually, while messing around with some magic to punk some fools he accidentally transported himself to a black void, where he encountered a glowing orb of light he came to know as "The Source", the beginning of all the universes. He tapped into a small portion of its power then bla bla bla he's fighting ancients.
 
-
 
 **Description**: Some wizard dude or whatever
 
-
 
 **Appearance**: See above
 
Role: [] (#support) Support
 
| | |
|----------|:---------:|
| [](#str) Strength | 21 + 1.4 |
| [](#agip) Agility | 14 + 1.5 |
| [](#int) **Intelligence** | **30 + 2.0** |
| Damage | Whatever |
| Move Speed | 310 |
| Attack Range | He's ranged bro |
 
-----------
 
**Q - Stat Shuffle**
 
| | |
|-|-|
| Ability | Target Unit |
| Affects | Ally or enemy Heroes |
 
 Shuffles the targets stats. If used on allies, a stat bonus is applied to all of the targets stats after the shuffle is complete.
 
**DURATION:** 8

**STAT BONUS:** 2/4/6/8

[](#mana) **MANA COST**: 95 / 105 / 115 / 125
 
[](#cd) **COOL DOWN**: 5 / 4 / 3 / 2
 
* For example, an enemy with 20s, 18a and 15i may wind up with 18s, 15a and 20i. However, an ally with those same stats will wind up with (assuming the skill is level 4) 26s, 23a and 28i. Depending on the difference between stats and the skills level, it could have a net positive affect on each stat if used on an ally. Low cooldown allows you to wreak havoc in a fight, although has short cast range.
 
-----------
 
**W - Break**
 
| | |
|-|-|
| Ability | Target Unit |
| Affects | Enemy hero |
 
 Breaks the fundamental connection between an enemies item and The Source, causing it to malfunction. Item is selected at random.

**DURATION:** 5/6/7/8
 
[](#mana) **MANA COST**: 120
 
[](#cd) **COOL DOWN**: 60 / 50 / 40 / 30
 
* An enemies malfunctioning item will be marked in his inventory. A malfunctioning item will continue to provide stat bonuses, but will not offer any other passive effects. Attempting to use the malfunctioning items active ability will result in a 50% chance of the active malfunctioning (doing nothing and going on cooldown), a 40% chance of it backfiring (varies from item to item. Abyssal Blade will cast on yourself, whereas BoTs will simply deal damage to you) and a 10% chance of functioning normally. 
 
-----------
 
**E - Block**
 
| | |
|-|-|
| Ability | Passive |
| Affects | N/A |
 
 Blocks random amounts of damage from each source of damage applied to Gabe. 
 
**BLOCK MIN:** 5% / 10% / 15% / 20%
**BLOCK MAX:** 10% / 20% / 30% / 50%
 
* It is NOT evasion, so it cannot bypassed with True Strike. Works pretty simply. After the final amount of damage is determined (after magic resistance, armour, other blocks, etc) the damage is reduced further by a random amount. For example, if Lina's ultimate would strike for 500 damage with this ability ignored, once the ability is taken into account (say, a level 3 Block) a random amount between 15% and 30% is blocked. In this case, say 20%. Only 400 damage will be dealt.
 
-----------
 
**R - Rewind**
 
| | |
|-|-|
| Ability | Active |
| Affects | Everyone and everything |
| Radius | Global |
 
 Turns back the course of events in the universe, returning everything to its original position several seconds earlier.
 
**TIME REWOUND:** 4 seconds

[](#mana) **MANA COST**: 100
 
[](#cd) **COOL DOWN**: 360 / 320 / 280
 
* This works as if rewinding the game in a replay. EVERYTHING goes back. If you used a BKB two seconds ago, and Gabe uses this ability, your BKB is back off cooldown, its time restored. All spells go back to whatever their cooldown was a few seconds ago. Etc. It's just like restoring a save state. It's a 'free undo' of a bad teamfight or an ally getting ganked. Nothing can prevent it or block it. 




 By that I mean, I don't need to do a bunch of missions introducing units and mechanics one at a time. And the missions involve traditional RTS objectives and style of play instead of escorting main characters through a level?

I'm specifically looking to play a single player campaign. I enjoy AoE, SC (original and II) and Sins of a Solar Empire. I've never played much Warcraft, but from what I could see it focused quite heavily on hero units, which I'm not that into. 




 Thanks. 














 And assuming they saved the two US citizens, would they face consequences for saving them over the POTUS?

Would the answer change if the two citizens were children?

The scenario isn't important, but imagine an ultimatum type scenario. A decision must be made - and quickly (maybe a hostage situation with only enough time to save one, or they're drowning, idk). Saving one group will lead to the death of the other group, doing nothing leads to everyone dying. For whatever reason they have to work as a group, so they can't split up an attempt to help both. Also, all this information is known to everyone involved. It's one or the other. 



















 I don't mind ordering from overseas. Looks like Ozgameshop ($74) is the cheapest I can find. 









 Frieza was considered to be the most powerful being of his time, and was for quite some time. Then all of a sudden, in the course of a few years, we go from Frieza to God level enemies.

How can there be so many levels of Super Saiyan above basic Super Saiyan without them ever being achieved in history before?  It's like if after years of 100m runners shaving milliseconds of someone's records, all of a sudden someone comes along and sets a record at 5 seconds. Then some other guy comes along and does it in 4, then a third guy in three all over the course of a few weeks.

If Super Saiyan is so rare, why are so many cropping up in the decade (or whatever) that DBZ takes place?

Why is everyone suddenly so powerful? Where were these bad guys a few decades before Goku?

**TL;DR: Why is this point in history seeing a sudden power spike?** 




 Scenario 1: Bruce Wayne is adopted by the [Nolastname's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_of_Malcolm_in_the_Middle#Main_characters) after his parents deaths.

He is a genetically gifted child with the ability to excel in anything he does, but has a very different temperament to Malcolm and the boys. Does he excel in this environment or wind up like Frances?

Scenario 2: He is the birth child of Lois and Hal, replacing Malcolm. Genetically the same as he was before, except now his parents never died. How does this impact his development? Remember the negative impact his older brothers will have on his behaviour.

But this is who would win!

 For more info: it's a 27 inch monitor, and a smaller (21 inch?) monitor, around a 600 PSU in my PC and a 40W/240V desktop light and a 6 speaker set up. Currently I just have the larger monitor, PC and speakers plugged in. It comes from an extension cord that runs to a powerboard accross the room. Would the rest be too much?

 Skyrim is the obvious standout. What other games have made great use of the Steam workshop?

 lisa simpson bart imagination. proof:

1) every1 in the family is dumb but also bart is dumb and homer and marge is dumb and maybe maggie is dumb but lisa be smart. this leads to conclusions that she is adopt or in barts imagine

2)lisa simpson is not truly around all the time sometime she not around sometime she is but always because bart imagined her

3) bart bad grades = dream up lisa amsipon so he feel good about bad grades

4) lisa simpson

5) in some episode lisa simpson in other episodes bart simpsons

6)you never seen ne1 alse talk to lisa simpsons but when they are its actually they are talking to bart who look like lisa for the audiance or lisa is imagined next 2 bart for audience

that is my teory 




 There is no widely accepted theory for either.

When people say shit like that, I doubt they're seriously considering the existing of Universes, let alone assuming that all universes must be 'parallel'. They're simply creating nice thoughts from their current situation, so those thoughts would naturally depend  on re-assuring them, which a parallel universe would serve to do.
 




 You're right, but I think it's a fair to assume he doesn't have a source in this instance since he opened his post with "I THINK" 




 No, opinions are fine on ELI5. You're acting as though they are worthless. Opinions, supported by reasoning, precedent and logic can still potentially be valid and are just fine in lieu of facts. The only issue is if it's presented as a fact, which 004forever didn't do, it's clearly an opinion.

Edit: You're fucking retarded. 




 Not a stupid question, your logic is sound. Your assumptions are not.

My thinking is that if a shitty video doesn't load, I'm more likely to go to another website and do something else, rather than watch more videos.

Google has this data. They can see how much traffic they can get. They can read through piles of feedback. They have the resources to make the change. But they haven't. The odds of it just being pure stupidity on Google's part is quite low.

Most likely, any people refusing to use YouTube because of the occasional video hiccup are probably not anywhere near enough in size to warrant a massive and expensive change in infrastructure. As far as I can tell, YouTube is still growing or at least stabalised in the first place, so I don't even think this problem exists. Lastly, what alternative? There aren't many competitors and what few there are certainly aren't popular.  




 I'm thinking so. It basically just seems like it would be TOO strong if it prevented blinking with just the Aghs. This puts higher limits on an OD Aghs wombo combo. It would just be too easy to set up, as opposed to heroes like Magnus or Enigma who at the very least have to jump into the fight first. 




 Correct, doesn't change the fact that over time that style of sitcom has become boring to me. I still appreciate that it was unique at it's time - like I said, I loved it. But I was simply saying that, over time, it loses what makes it unique because it is now the standard. Hence why it probably doesn't appeal to today's market to quite the extent it did in the 90s.

It's just one of many options today, and many people are sick of the formula before even considering giving older sitcoms a chance. 




 Way, I was even further off than you guys. I thought it was "gotta love those Starbuck's lovers", as some sort of stab at the hipster movement or... something. 




 To an extent. I used to really, really love Seinfeld, but each time I rewatch it my opinion of it lowers a little. It was great... for it's time. By today's standards it is very much the typical sitcom. Especially in the later seasons. 




 I think there are two reasons people believe this whole thing about 'ridiculous law suits':

1) People misinterpret the word 'sue', as OP has clearly done, or assume that because someone is suing someone they've probably won. A newspaper reports that a burgler is suing a homeowner because he tripped over while stealing their TV. People jump on ship and say how wrong it is, without realising that it hasn't gone to court yet, and he'll probably lose.

2) The flipside: the newspapers don't report enough detail, and people assume the party doing the suing is wrong, when in reality there is a good reason for it. The famous McDonald's hot coffee suit. People see a woman suing McDonald's for her coffee being too hot, and they laugh at her and say the country is going to hell. What they don't do is read into it, where they'll find out that she [severely burned herself (NSFW)](http://blog.3nips.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/stella_liebeck_burned_by_mcdonalds_coffee-524x373.jpg) and required expensive medical treatment and had permanent damage to her vagina. Nor do they read about how that particular McDonald's was serving their coffee too hot on purpose so people would take longer to drink it and increase their chances of ordering more food. Nor do they read about how the McDonald's had been warned several times in the past to quit this practice by health and safety authorities.

These, taken together, greatly reinforce the perception of how common ridiculous lawsuits actually are successful. 




 I'll start by saying I understand that just because countries aren't punished for breaking rules doesn't mean the rules are ineffective - they can be preventative. However I'm specifically interested in cases where Country A broke specific rules of warfare and the United Nations (or historical equivalents) enacted a punishment on said country, rather than just a list of ways the UN is effective because of the laws.

 Take away Mayweather's ability to win on points, it's now a no rules, fight to the death/knockout/surrender. Who wins?

Round 1) Modern day

Round 2) In their prime

It's all fair game - kicking, punching, grabs and throws.

Hopefully you guys aren't sick of the Pac/Mayweather/Tyson threads yet! 




 The first rule is if they are shown dead, they still may come back to life anyway. 




 Awesome idea. Also a balancing nightmare, but if Valve can make him work, I'd love to see him in the game. 




 I don't even eat Nutella! 




 It would last around 21 minutes before Mike Tyson's lung condition started to effect his performance. Just a few Mayweather's could wreck his face then. 




 It's strange to think that there could be a time where you didn't know what you looked like. This isn't really up to the standard of most answers on askhistorians (I'm usually the one asking the questions!), however I mostly wanted to reply to suggest that the average person could probably see their reflection in water in ponds and what not.

Apart from that, I know we have had mirrors throughout most of human history, made of bronze and copper, so some people definitely would have access to a clear reflection of themselves. However I'm unsure if the typical medieval commoner would have had access to them. Which leads to a follow up question of my own: assuming easy access to reflections were not available, would it have been common for towns to have publically available mirrors or reflecting ponds specifically for this purpose? 




 I'm not upset, but I'm definitely disappointed with some of the content that gets upvoted here. But I guess TIL =/= Interesting Facts no matter how much I want it to. 




 TIL that a TV show uses a common writing tool that most TV shows and movies use. Fucking wow. 




 Because you cherrypicked a movie where it wasn't the case. Most zombie movies do actually seem to follow this rule. 




 Hence, Mayweather was the better boxer. 




 Fuck off. 




 for no reason

Because they're bad. Just because something is the same as its source material doesn't automatocally make it good or immune to criticism... 




 But that's a conscious choice. They could have made him less based on Stark. It doesn't make the criticism any less valid 




 He also had a team of writers to fill in for his weaknesses 




 He is just trying to downplay Whedon criticism as being reactionary to his popularity, as if that makes it less valid somehow 




 Bullshit. People have always had this criticism about him, it's just easier to share thanks to the Internet 




 They could have written it so Ultron wasn't based off Tony 




 It's Prime Tyson and he gets a canon of his choice. 

Round 1: any real world canon
Round 2: any canon from fiction
Round 3: can Mayweather clinch him mid air (non fictional canon)

Tyson must survive. 




 6.85 when? 




 I really disagree. May weather and Pac are no slouches. A 2v1 is hard. Lots of room for them to just grapple/wrestle him and wail on his face  




 People tried it against Tyson and still got BTFO 









 People are welcome to express their dissatisfaction with something. If the boxing world doesn't want to change, then fine, no one is forcing it to just as much as those that aren't enjoy boxing in its current state aren't being forced to watch it.

However, if it does want to change, maybe as viewership declines, or simply knowing there is a larger market to tap into, then the feedback is valuable. People are just expressing their views, there is no right or wrong.

Don't like others opinions on boxing? No one is forcing you to read them! 




 Right, and I think people want to see some changes to boxing to make it more interesting to watch.

Most people are admitting Mayweather won fair and square, but they just don't want this to be the way to win. Change may be needed in the sport. 




  I think if someone is a good person at heart (and nice does not always = good, btw), they can never be truly ugly.

Was Hitler ugly? 




  That being said, I'm sure you're lovely. I honestly do not believe that ugly people exist,

This is just condescending and makes what you say sound hollow. Ugly people do exist and they need to learn to cope with it instead of being deluded and thinking they're attractive.

Edit: I don't know why I'm being downvoted. If someone tells me that they think I'm smart, that would fill me with confidence. If they follow that up by saying "I think everybody is smart, including those guys over there who huffed paint fumes every day and can barely remember their own names" then it would make the original compliment have far less meaning. 




 'Support' in this context means continuing to watch and pay money to the industry. 




 There's a tradeoff. Using more strength may score you the same, and seem like a waste, but it deals more damage to the opponent. Some boxes prefer going for points, while others for damage. 




 I don't see why dodging and blocking scores any points...

...? It doesn't. Go look at the punch stats, Mayweather landed more punches than Manny. You can call the sport boring and Mayweather's style is absolutely awful to watch, but at the end of the day he landed more punches. Were we even watching the same fight? 




 Well done. 




 ITT: People who don't know shit about boxing repeat stuff the heard on TV, the internet, from their friends, etc.

How ironic that those people were exactly right. Not just in their prediction of the winner, but how it would play out. Textbook Floyd, I made some easy money off people like you. 




 Logic dictates that being punched in the head for a living isn't healthy.

Only if you make the assumption that being punched in the head is unhealthy to begin with. Personally I think it makes you smarter by exercising your brain more 




 Why? 




 OP doesn't know that. Just because the answer is 'we don't know' doesn't mean it's a bad question. Also people might have written about the masses, like if the characters in a lot of plays from that period where stressed about work it would open some discussion. Diaries aren't necessarily needed 




 Haven't they found evidence of injured early humans being cared for? They can't hunt for themselves, so others helped them. 




 Care to elaborate? 









 Who hasn't Mayweather fought?

Pacquiao. 




 Bruce Lee could easily beat Mike Tyson in a fight. 




 Any source I can find (all of which should be taken with a grain of salt) puts his networth above $100m. This also means he will be doubling his net worth from this fight. 









 The best change Alch got this patch wasn't to Alch himself. It was decreased creep bounty, as Greed is now a larger percentage of gold per creep kill. This aghs thing is an interesting change, but I can only seeing it ever being meaningful in ultra lategame scenarios on a core Alch and if you actually have a gamechanging ult on your team that is still meaningful lategame. It's super niche. 














 Oops. 




 Enjoying titties is degrading?  




 Actually I hate their inclusion in the films. Every enemy Widow or Hawkeye, or even Cap take out is just another enemy that Thor or Hulk would take out with an effortless AoE attack. 

It also makes it harder to have the villain go full force. Any villain that can go hand to hand with Thor should be able to snap Widow in half in a heartbeat. But they don't. So we have to see these characters getting hurt enough to make the villain seem strong but not so badly that they're seriously hurt. It makes the villains seem inconsistent.

Their inclusion just hurts the movies imo.

 Being evil isn't the defining quality of being a monster.

Being a monster or a monstrosity by definition refers to extremes though. I'd say a pure evil person is more of a monster than a human being that struggles with moral dilemmas in ever episode. 




 But the term 'monster' itself refers to an extreme to begin with, so I'd say someone who is purely evil to the absolute extreme as is so from birth is still more of a monster than someone who slowly becomes bad/evil (but not quite as evil) over the course of time. 




 It's saying that someone is more evil if they're less evil and gradually become a little evil then someone who is pure evil. It makes no sense because you're either more evil than someone or you aren't, it doesn't matter if you were good to begin with.

Someone who quickly become evil from a young age, perhaps because of upbringing or a traumatic event, is still more evil than a good person who slowly starts to do morally questionable things.

 Do we know how much money Microsoft made off the Zune? Perhaps they pushed it for four generations in the hopes it would take off, while making barely anything or losing money. Didn't Microsoft only start making money back on entering the console market quite recently?

But the other answers were simple... and more concise. 




 What did he mean by 'you're not man enough'?

Did the reporter threaten him during the 'inaudible' part and he was saying the reporter wasn't man enough to take him, or was it just a random, empty insult? 




 Careful. He WILL destroy you 




 Title is a bit of a mouthful, so I'll provide an example: I have a gun that holds 20 bullets. I have 200 ammo in reserve. I fire ten bullets. I reload, throwing the old clip/magazine/whatever away. I now have 190 ammo in reserve and 20 in my gun.

Wouldn't it be more realistic and more interesting mechanically to only have 180 left (since I discarded 10 bullets that remained in my gun earlier)? Whenever I play a horror survival or a more realistic styled game I always wish it worked that way. Even for more fast paced multiplayer FPS games I think it would make monitoring ammo and deciding when to reload more interesting.

So... why ISN'T it that way? Seems like it would be the natural default? What started this trend, or has it always been this way? 




 He's wrong. Lee wasn't beaten because he never fought. That is to say he also never won. 




 almost

I can't seem to find ANY tournaments his in. 




 I'm going to voice a bit of a controversial opinion here: but I'll just say he seems to be a good EXHIBITIONIST, not necessarily a good fighter. He showcased his (still incredibly impressive) speed, accuracy, strength and technique in highly controlled environments. A lot of claims about Bruce are more legend than fact.

There are plenty of martial artists that would hand his ass to him on a plate in a real fight. I'm not trying to undermine his accomplishments, he wasn't trying to be a fighter in the first place, so it doesn't matter. I just feel a lot people put him on a pedestal and assume the man must be an unparalleled fighter.

I've heard people say he could beat Mike Tyson (in his prime) in a fight.

 For example, work sent me on a training exercise where we learnt things like "You only use 10% of your brain" and some people are "left brained while others are right brained" and basically played a bunch of pre-school tier games that would somehow making us better workers... or something, while my actual work piles up at my desk. 

One quick Google search completely tears the very basis of these training sessions apart. I wish I could remember some of the other pseudo-psychology I've heard, I just remembered those two examples because they're common in the real world too.

I've been to about four like this in just two years, and dozens of employees came alongside me to each. The amount of money lost on labour, travel expenses and to hire these people would be phenomenal.

So why do companies, who are probably finding ways to cut costs everywhere, have such poor quality control for these sorts of events.

My perception about how common this is may just be distorted, but these training sessions have occurred in multiple workplaces for me and my friends have shared similar sentiments. 




 It was non-stop laughs, right?

Not really, but I can see where you're coming from an agree. Perhaps spending so much time interacting with certain communities has affected my perception on what is and isn't 'cringed' at by the broader community. 




 Paraphrasing a reply I made elsewhere in this thread:

"It doesn't really answer my question directly in the first place: are they attempting to get you to remember the ad by appealing to something we like (and failing, but having the end results remain the same anyway), or deliberately making it something communities like Reddit will cringe at and recall.

I'm really more interested in the thought process of the advertiser rather than whether or not the ad is effective. Are they disconnected, or deliberately producing material that communities will cringe at but remember anyway." 




 True, but on the other side of the coin I barely remembered it and I only saw the ad yesterday and probably won't remember it by next week. I can't think of another example off the top of my head. I guess that's just me though.

At any rate, it doesn't really answer my question directly in the first place: are they attempting to get you to remember the ad by appealing to something we like (and failing, but having the end results remain the same anyway), or deliberately making it something communities like Reddit will cringe at and recall.

 I'm just going to copy and paste my response from that thread:

For me, whether modding or not is good for gaming depends entirely on whose perspective you're referring too.
Obviously, this change is only a benefit to modders. They can still put their products up for free, if they want, or they can look to make a profit (no matter how small it is, it's more than nothing, I don't think "only 25%" is a valid argument).

However, most people complaining about this are complaining about it from the point of view of consumers, not modders. For us, it is bad.

The most probably positive is it will lead to higher quality mods. But honestly, I don't see that happening. People already put a great deal of care and attention into their mods. The marginal increase in quality that paid mods might create is in no way worth the several dollars I will now be charged. And even if the increase in quality is substantial, I think most consumers would prefer hundreds of great mods for free instead of just picking 2-3 paid mods that are of slightly higher quality than usual.

On the opposite side, we're already seeing downside to paid mods ignoring price (issues over ownership, one mod already has in game pop-ups in its free version, issues concerning mods breaking or not interacting together, making them worthless after you buy them, and so on).

I think it's a real stretch to call this immoral, or to say Valve/modders can't or shouldn't want to be paid for their services. However, that's not the question. The question is if there is anything WRONG with it. And I'd say yanking away hours of enjoyment and a strong community built around modding for joy, not money, is seen as wrong by a lot of people.

On a final note, it's one less thing about Steam I liked taken away. The workshop wasn't perfect, but it was convenient (if a mod is on both workshop and Nexus, workshop is a slightly easier install. Now I won't use it at all). So, for me at least, it's making want to purchase games on Steam even less. Anyway, that's my two cents. 




 The modders can make their own site and sell it. But they'd probably make less money than selling it through Steam with a 100% cut on their own website.

They're not paying for the hosting costs or effort on Valve's part. The paying for being in a highly visible (and therefore highly valuable) location. Anyway, I think the 25% cut is the LEAST important part of this debate. It's a number and it can change.

The more important issue is how this will affect the quality or mods and the value of games that are highly dependent on mods.

 I suppose the same might be said of other villains in the franchise, but as far as I can recall they all had plans that at some point required them to make a big scene. 




 So... Ultron could have easily won if he just didn't make his presence know to the Avengers, right?

The only times he had to make his presence known for his plans to work was when he first encountering Jarvis. But he could have killed Jarvis, escaped though the Internet and laid low. Stark wouldn't have been able to work out the AI came alive, just that it caused a huge issue with his network.

He could have built his robot army/meteor machine in private, unknown to the rest of the world. Once the thing went into motion, it is unlikely the Avengers could work out what was happening in time.

But what about the twins? Or becoming known to the scientists who he tricked into building him his new body?

He wouldn't need either of these things if the Avengers weren't after him in the first place.

TL;DR: Ultron dun goofed. 




 I disagree. Enough bullets fired in Bane's direction, eventually one will hit. 




 This. I could have a decade of training, I'm not going to beat modern day Mike Tyson, let alone Prime Tyson. The only answer is 'no one', since I don't want to spend my last year alive training. 




 mostly jokingly, that there are other factors in being attractive than having a big dick or broad shoulders.

I think most people would rather date a 7/10 personality than a 7/10 looks than a 10/10 personality and 5/10 looks. For a lot of people for already have nice personalities, their bodies are probably the area they need to work on most.

 uTorrent recently experienced some severe backlash after including malware in one of its updates. I suspect this downgrade possibly has something to do with that (why they don't just release an update that has it removed is another question). 




 It's really not that hard to follow to be honest. There might be lots of movies, but they're still quite simplistic movies. 




 I fail to see how that's relevant to what he's said. I've seen them all in order and I still agree with him. They're just bad movies, but the hype train won't end as long as there are fans to eat it up. 




 Well what were you expecting from capeshit? 









 It also costs a fortune. There's no real reason to buy it yet. If you haven't got any Civ games, you're best off getting Civ V + all expansions for less than BE. They need to make some fantastic expansions to make that game worth buying. 









 Yeah, but the question is can you do it with a transporter.  









 In the TNG episode "Relics", Scotty and his friend (Franklin? Let's call him Franklin) where trapped inside transport buffers. Scotty's pattern was saved, but his friend's was lost forever.

So, it's possible to eliminate a pattern to prevent re-assembly of Superman. 




 Who is operating it would be a factor.

What's Data's fastest feat in terms of hand/eye cordination? Perhaps he could pull it off?

 Followup question (if that's OK on this subreddit, trying to save myself making a new thread): Did the treatment of the Jewish people improve much immediately following the war? Would it be a far argument to say Hitler's extreme treatment of the Jews could have had the effect of improving popular opinion of them in the long run? 









 hahahahaha OP that meme is dank!! BAZINGA! 




 I can't say I'm surprised by a billionaire wanting even more money, but I kind of see where OP is coming from. To my knowledge, Valve wasn't started to be like your typical company. It was a guy who loved videogames wanting to make videogames.

If I were a billionaire, every extra dollar would seem marginally less appealing. Eventually, I'd care more about pleasing my fans (and stroking my massive ego to my own circle jerk) than making any more money. OK, maybe that tune would change if I actually were a billionaire, but at the moment I guess the idea of having that much money is so alien to me I just can't imagine why you'd NEED any more - especially at the expense of your own fans and your own 'child' (Valve). 




 People realise this. It still has potential to effect people that don't use the Steam workshop. If a person wants to sell their mod, they can remove it from all sources except the Steam workshop. 




 Interested in knowing this too. 




 I'll play Devil's Advocate here: were you banned for copy + pasting a comment? Perhaps it's just an automated filter. 




 While many fans were expecting the surprise announcement Valve had been hyping this week to be news about the highly anticipated Half-Life 3, Valve fanboys were still pleased when Valve instead showed off their latest product: Valve possession vans. Currently being tested in the United States, these vans will repossessing your personal goods and belongings in exchange for money owed for mandatory mods, Valve updates and Valve Gold Subscriptions. The vans are expected for a worldwide launch next year. 









 "who the fuck thought this was a good idea".

Considering Sandler's box office pull, I'm guessing the answer is "people who like money". 




 You're right, I was completely wrong on the details. Men seem to cost more as their accidents are expensive. Same principle, swap genders and ignore the part about men's accidents tending to not pay out. 




 Watch from 0:42 seconds onwards in OPs video. You see the guy jump on his car (coinciding with about 1:16 in the video you linked).

You can see he is completely blocked by traffic 'stage left'. [Here's a screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/Jv37wtR.png) (the traffic is clearer if you watch the video though).

In fact, I would not be surprised if this exact angle is exactly what the Defense Attorney was discussing in this quote here:
"When we saw the first video **[I believe he is referring to the one you linked]**, it could have been interpreted in a different way, but after looking at other videos **[this is referring to OPs video, which was considered vital to getting a proper interpretation of events]** and putting it all together, I think we must be careful not to take a decision too quickly," Vaillancourt said." 
























 The name sounds familiar, but I can't seem to find it with a yellow layout in the early 2000s. Perhaps I used this too.

 Why is this getting downvoted? Not only does gender effect social perception on virginity at that age, but also the statistics show that there is a difference between proportions of virgins in each gender. 









 This might also be further exacerbated by deliberately picking smarter/more studious children and adults who are less interested in general knowledge. 




 This. Oftentimes I get a little annoyed I can't remember something I know I knew a long time ago.

 I hate the slippery slope argument to be honest.

 Dude, that's literally everyone. No one is going to think you have low self-esteem.

 I think part of the joke was that 'nice guys' tend to vilify attractive people. If he's good looking or works out he must be a jerk in their minds. I think it's suiting.

It adds to the comic because the whole nice guy mentality is that girls overlook nice guys for good looking jerks. But... Maybe the good looking guy is the real nice guy.

This is a non-issue in Australia where prostitution is perfectly legal. All it's lead to is much, much safer sex, since prostitutes need to be medically examined consistently and operate out of licensed venues. 




 Shark Tank shootings also go a lot longer than the show implies. Some pitches can go up to an hour.

 There is a reasonable expectation that if you enter a relationship with someone that they're NOT going to go and help a bunch of other guys get off... 




 I'm pretty sure he was making a joke. 




 He said what WOULD happen, not what should happen. Let's be realistic: there is nothing wrong with the ad with the current genders or if they were switched, but the uproar would be much greater if the roles were reversed. 




 That is a global average, so it's probably bought down by underdeveloped countries. Average in the United States is 5.6 inches.

Even then, that surprises me. Not trying to brag, I'm only 6 inches, but I guess I always expected mine to be below average since I'm really short. 




 Can you provide an actual citation?

You make it sound like the male and female brains are completely distinct though. Isn't it more of a continuum. If so, where do you draw the line for 'feminine male who wishes he was a female' and 'male who actually has a female brain'?

 He got his shit fucked up 




 Contracts require a payment or 'consideration' from both parties to be considered legally valid. Because he gave away the sperm for free, what he signed was not a contract.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_contract_law#Consideration_and_estoppel 




 He provided the sperm for free.

Edit: I guess I'm getting downvoted because I wasn't clear enough. Consideration is required by both parties for a contract to be considered legally valid. Because he donated the sperm for free, it is not considered a valid contract. What he signed is not legally binding. 




 are mosquitoes pointless enough that it's okay to eradicate them anyway, if we don't have a way to eradicate just the malaria?

And the answers seem to be yes, and we don't. They spread a lot more diseases than just malaria too 




 The point he is making is we can eliminate malaria, and still address the overpopulation problem by helping to develop the rest of the world. 




 We eradicate diseases. You have no problem with curing AIDS, I'm guessing? So why not eliminate malaria too? Because that's what they're trying to do. There has not been any evidence put forward that this would have a negative consequence beyond the non-existence of a pretty weird insect. 




 Do you have any sources or anything at all to back up your claims? Any expert I've heard speak on the subject has pretty much said they have no positive impact on any ecosystem. 




  Back then, an obese lady/man was considered attractive, not because of reproduction instinct, but because it represented wealth and status.

This is outright contentious, there is no academic consensus. Yes, fat people might have been more SOUGHT after. This does not make them more ATTRACTIVE. A supermodel hanging off the arms of an 80 year old billionaire, with 50 other girls after him, isn't necessarily more sexually appealing than a normal, young guy with just five girls after him. They could be willfully overlooking how repulsive he is for the money.

I guess this comes down to the definition of attractive, but I believe we're talking physical here.

Also, as specific traits become less correlated with wealth/power (fat people and skinny people are in all classes), these things matter less. I wonder if we care more about our 'primal' attractions now than for most of recorded history. 




 and the fat chicks were the supermodels.

This is highly overstated and only arguably true for some societies in very small periods of time. More importantly though, it's the result of the implications of their fat. Fat = wealth.  It's hard to even argue that it's attraction (more like fat people being more desirable for their wealth, while their suitors pretended to find them attractive to get in good with them). There's a lot of debate around this among historians.

More on point though, as society grows and everyone has access to the same food and exercise choices, the same medicine and the quality of life increases across the board, it might become more normal to play of our basic instincts of attraction rather than societal standards. If most mind find large eyes on women attractive because of a natural response, then it's unlikely to see that disappear without some highly unpredictable shaking up of social order. 

1,000 years is a long time, but if the quality of life keeps improving and physical attributes continue to correlate less strongly with wealth/power, it's hard to see that happening.

 Small businesses want to protect their brand too. An ice cream store in my hometown had a very identifiable name and made amazing ice cream you couldn't get elsewhere. Their name was used by a competitor in one of our major cities, without permission of the owner's. When the owners went to expand into the city, they were thought to be the knockoff. They managed to force the other store to change their name eventually though. 




 Cold call electricians. If they say they can't do it, ask if there is someone they know who can or if a different profession might fill this request.

You could also call the manufacturer of the grills and ask who supplies the heat coils (they make not make their own) and then contact them and ask for a custom made one. They probably won't take small orders but it's worth a shot. 




 It's not hard to understand. What point are you trying to make? What physicists have you been speaking to that can't understand that?

 I will watch it and see for myself with context, but I agree. It doesn't sound funny at all based on the quotes in this thread 




 Why can't they just test the strength of the balls in the first place? Why can't the balls be supplied by the league officials instead of teams? 




 Regarding the 40% cut, do they often inflate the amount you are suing for to account for the lawyers fee, or are you just automatically 40% out of whatever you should have got if someone commits a crime against you?

For example, if I'm suing someone for damaging my car for $10,000, will I sue for $14,000 to cover lawyers fees, or do I pretty much have to accept that the moment damage is done to my car that I'm at best getting 60% of it back?

I'm not sure if you'd even need a lawyer for the car example, so if not replace it with something you would need a lawyer for. 




 The law prevents you from making any statements that would incite public panic.

The entire crux of that joke is based on the fact that he knew the listening audience would interpret it as being a dangerous gas.

Yes, it's stupid that people don't do a quick Google search to see that he's joking. But he made the joke PRECISELY knowing that they wouldn't.

It doesn't matter if it's true or not from a legal perspective: make a statement intended to incite panic  face the punishment. 




 Tax seems like the easiest to get a job in due to a ton of small Tax firms in my area, but I have been considering auditing too. Basically, I'm going to see where Grad programs take me, they tend to give you a rotation across various fields. If I don't get one, I'll probably get into Tax.

Good point about the auditing though, makes me feel a little better. 




 He is more of a science/engineering genius though.

 Struggled with anxiety all through my teens and early 20s. I'm 24 and graduating midsemester. I've improved dramatically (only get specific anxiety trigger now, rather than the constant feeling of dread and unwillingness to leave my house). 

However, one thing I haven't had much area improving on is formal/professional interaction. I feel I may be a bit too laid back, and what few attempts I've had to interact professionally have always been a bit awkward (not knowing when to shake someone's hand, or wrap up a conversation, my voice gets really weak and quiet randomly in conversation's I'm not comfortable with, not good at saying stuff like "nice to meet you" because I just throw it out in random places for some reason).

I know it's weird, but I just go from 'fake it til you make it' mode that I put on in casual meeting to 'complete awkward mode' once a level of formality is introduced. Probably a fear of being judged?

Anyway, the important question: how do I get over this bump? I feel like it's my last step towards feeling good about my future. 




 Damn, never heard any of that. What a player. 




 Those are ports of recent remakes though. I'd imagine porting a Playstation game to PC all these years later would be much more difficult than porting a 3DS game that was released within the last 5 years.

 labrador joke 




 but on the side he got the best poon Hollywood had the offer.

Huh, I remember recalling in some behind the scenes Seinfeld stuff that he wasn't really involved with women during most of Seinfeld's run, then he got married towards the end. I think that's exactly what sparked the gay rumors in fact. 




 I think he's stand-up has grown less appealing over time, but he still seems really funny just making off the cuff comments. 




 I still feel sorry for her to be honest. I imagine she feels how I feel when I try to act professional in the workplace, while secretly wanting to throw up on every client I meet from nerves.

 In his explanation of the events, he says that that seat was reserved so it was obvious she was trying to get attention.

I think he just acknowledged her because he new if he didn't, she'd interrupt more anyway. 




 She clearly tried to get a nice face shot, but missed the camera entirely. 




 Creature building also was entirely meaningless. Many were expecting it to affect things like chances of survival and actually requiring you to build a ,functional creature  




 Right. But what does quitting resolve? You just lose yourself a job. The simple fact is, to an extent, they can lie and you can either take it or quit. 




 What kind of job would help you get experience in programming though? That really feels more like something you'd learn at Uni though or by yourself, right? I'm not in IT so I'm not contradicting you, just curious.

Also is programming more specialized? Or are you just talking about very fundamental programming? 




 So if I miss the tree I go to prison? 




 My best guess: we won't find out. People speculated for months about how Sherlock killed himself and we didn't get an answer. I'm guessing we'll get the same with Moriarty. 




 I find this hard to believe, but will happily be proven wrong. My main issue with this is the fact that if it were so cheap, why doesn't a competitor just slash 5k off his car and get all the market share. Eventually other businesses would react and cars would be cheap. Product differentiation only answers part of the story, there would surely be huge markets for cheap high quality cars.

Is it possible whoever told you this failed to factor in marketing, administration, sales %, salaries, R D, etc?

An alternative to OP: it's a promotion expense or they're making money on average by getting people through the door and buying other things with their free item 




 Wait, what happened? 




 Maybe your girlfriend has a loose ass 




 That's /r/fantheories for you 




 There's also the fact that his friends were about to be shot, perhaps Sherlock just quickly wanted to make the call to Watson and save everyone ASAP. 




 So let me get this straight: you're suggesting that Moriarty, at the climax of his plan, among all the emotion and tension in the air, just suddenly goes "wait a minute, I want out lol".

And on top of that, Sherlock just willfully let's the criminal who is about to kill his friends go, despite already having a plan to fake his death that would save his friends anyway (ie. he doesn't need to co-operate with Moriarty in the first place. There is no reason for it).

I really believe Moriarty just straight up faked his death and pulled the wool over everyone's eyes the same way Sherlock did. I would not be surprised if Moffat pulls the same stunt of not explaining how he did it either.

 Correlation =/= causation, you're right. However you're being retarded if you think you can use that claim to dismiss basic reasoning. There is no definite word on why he left Twitter because Joss hasn't spoken up. And even if he did, he could very well lie in order to keep things 'cool'.

What we can do it speculate, weigh the evidence and form conclusions. It seems like he left Twitter precisely because of the backlash.

You could post that stupid picture in response to any number of commonly held beliefs about historical events or figures too, by the way. They're often based on finding evidence based on the timing of events (eg. seeing the rise of iron coinciding with the fall of the Minoan civilization has linked the two, even with no direct evidence). A smart person does not fall for the correlation = causation fallacy. A smart person also doesn't use correlation =/= causation to dismiss evidence and reasoning.

But this is all greatly overanalysing. We're talking about a man quitting Twitter. Around the time he was getting attacked, over a subject he has expressed great personal belief over. It's not a leap to conclude that those two events are linked.

 This is why we have boxing gloves.

If you're suggesting that boxes gloves aren't designed with damage the face in mind, I think you'll find you're wrong. What that common TIL often leaves out is that the gloves distribute the blow of the punch more evenly, leading to less facial damage than if the gloves were smaller. It's part of the design to not damage the face too much while also enabling you to hit the face in the first place.

No, we are assigning names to acts, not motives to animals.

If you have two dogs, and one is well behaved and the other attacks anyone on sight, it is perfectly fair to describe one as violent and aggressive. But to you they're not... because using those words would be anthropomorphising them.

So what's your solution: come up with new words, or pretend both dogs are exactly the same? 









 Definitely a memorised act from what I've seen. 




 Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to enhance their acts. 

Their live act seems to fit this definition of standup routine perfectly. Maybe if it's a group it isn't considered standup? But sounded like the right word to me.

Semantics aside, yes, I'm referring to their live shows. 




 You're right, but they didn't say that. In which case it makes them hypocritical. Which is also within their rights. 

I'm just curious to know if they actually broke a specific rule/I'm overlooking something or if the mods are being hypocritical or making excuses to ban specific subs. 

I have no idea why you think I thought they need to be lawful or fair, I understand how the Internet works. 




 So they'd be fine with those subs in the long run, it was just too close to the original banning of FPH? 




 Right, but it was different people making these other subs, with a different set of rules. Can it really be called ban evasion? They're making a place to avoid the mistakes FPH made. 




 Unfortunately, my post tracking informed me it would be arriving with the scammer today, so I hastily tied it to a GoG account. The account is empty so I could sell you the whole account, but I can fully understand if you don't want to take that option. As of now I'm just considering it a loss. 




 These subs weren't even around long enough to break the brigading rule. Why where they banned?

What exact action should fatpeoplehate have taken to not avoid getting banned? How could I go about re-creating that sub with a few changes to prevent in from being banned? 









 I guess we'll have to agree to disagree. 




 Why were those subs banned, if they technically didn't break any rules? 




 You understand that plenty of bullies also have great self-esteem, right? I hate this idea that anyone that is mean must be doing it because of 'their own problems'. Some people have everything handed to them on a silver platter, along with looks and health, and still enjoy picking on others. 




 Honestly, I think you're really overstating the problem. Fatpeoplehate gave a lot of people a place to go and discuss that kind of content, sure. But now that it's deleted I can't imagine the average FPH user going out of there way to post that content elsewhere. It's too much of a hassle, you will get into too many arguments and just find most of your posts banned, have to constantly be making accounts, etc. It's too much hassle and it won't even come close to what made browsing FPH entertaining.

I, personally, loved FPH, but after it's deletion I'll simply continue to post relevant things in other subs and slowly forget it ever existed. The average FPH user is probably more likely to do that, then try and 'fight the man'. 




 The thing is, this law basically decides what you consent to and that's that. I'd be interested in seeing how this case plays out in court though. 




 I'll take the downvotes in stride.

 As the YouTube commenter that lead me to asking this question puts it:

Do women toss their ass at Yo-Yo Ma?? Or is that just Rock and Rap stars?

Would you feel the same 'passion seeping into the music' if you did a blind test of 10 musicians, 9 of which are random classical musicians and the 10th is Yo-Yo Ma? 




 Yes, it's still available. How would you like to sort out payment? 




 Why would they ban it, it hasn't broken the rules. Are you legitimately retarded? 




 Already lodged. My main concern is he will use the code in the next few days and eBay will do nothing. I'd prefer to be proactive.

 So I recently purchased The Witcher 3 physical. However, as it was shipping, a friend purchased me the game on Steam. When the physical box arrived, I decided to sell it on eBay. I wrote the CD key down as I was also planning on selling it online. Eventually someone on eBay purchased it. Unfortunately, after I shipped it, they instated a chargeback. I do not use eBay often so when I checked his history, I noticed he had no prior purchases and his username was a random string. I contacted him and he responded by saying he has no intentions to send me the game back unless I pay for shipping (which he says is somehow $30).

**Long story short**, I've obviously been scammed. Fortunately, I have the GoG key. I want someone to use it before he the package arrives at his house. If anyone is willing to purchase it, I'd be willing to arrange some sort of exchange. We can work the details out, but I'd feel more comfortable receiving payment in advance if possible. I can show you the chargeback in a screenshot as proof that this occurred. I will charge you the price as per GoG in your country so you're basically just buying a digital copy of the game from me.

Bruce Lee's powers work the same way as John's in the other post: At any point Bruce chooses, he can instantaneously gain knowledge of what his experience over the next 10 seconds would have been had he not used his power. He can't control the version of himself that makes choices over those 10 seconds, so he can't game the system by using the extra time to think or by using trial and error over a series of visions. He also can't use his power within his power, ie the version of him in a vision would never choose to use his power. He can, however, use his power, do something, and then immediately use his power again to see what they thing he did changed.

Round 1: Both Tyson and Lee are at their peak.

Round 2: Modern Tyson vs peak Lee

 The combatants are the physical weapon users: Auron, Khimari, Tidus, Rikku and Wakka. Canon is based on cutscenes durability (eg. Being held at gunpoint was a genuine death threat).

Round 1: no magic, no overdrives, default weapons.

Round 2: Access to magic from their default paths (eg. Tidus gets haste). No overdrives, default weapons.

Round 3: One overdrive use, magic as per round 2, default weapons.

I understand the ambiguity between cutscenes and battle, just try and bridge the gap as best as possible.

 1. Because she is kicking me out and trying to keep all the things we bought together, so I would like legal grounds to take what is mine. So, ethically, she is the one that needs to 'man up' and give me what is mine. I would just like legal support instead of trying to take it by force. (For example, I paid 12k for the car, she paid 8k, but it's in her name, you're saying I don't deserve at least an even split of that amount? Not that it matters, because I'm asking for LEGAL advice, not your opinion).

2. LEGALLY a de-facto relationship IS entitled to a 50/50 split.

Under Australian Law, separating de facto couples have substantially the same rights and liabilities as those of married couples with regard to property settlements. This includes claims for spousal maintenance and superannuation splits.

So, morally, I think she owes me since she is trying to keep more than a fair share of things - after cheating on me - including personal property that I paid for out of pocket (the majority of assets I believe I paid for to begin with).

And legally, up until a year and a half ago I was entitled to a clean 50/50 split of assets and finances. I am wondering if those rights still hold considering the change in finance arrangements over the last month.

**Finally**, this is a board for legal advice, nothing else. "Man up" isn't legal advice. I'm asking about my legal rights so take your useless advice to another sub.

I mean, seriously, you want to live in a world where someone can cheat, kick their partner to the curb, and keep all their things? You want me to roll over and take it? That isn't manning up, that's being a little bitch and letting someone walk all over you. 









 I started flossing several months ago. Sometimes daily, usually every 2-3 days though. There is usually a bad smell released following the pluck, even if no food is trapped there. Is that normal? 




 If it helps, I never would have noticed if you didn't point it out. 




 Basically, for about 6 years me and my girlfriend split all expenses. I can't say it was exactly 50/50, but the point is it may as well been because no one ever questioned whose money was being used on expenses. For the first few years we did do an even split, but we gave up on that idea after some time. For some periods, I was probably paying more and vice versa.

However, around the 6 year mark, we moved cities and I went back to Uni. My girlfriend got a full time job and handled all the expenses. I've been trying to find part-time work for a year and a half with no luck (truthfully, I was looking for full-time work for awhile, got a job, then realised I wanted part-time considering it would delay Uni graduation by 4 years, hence why it took so long to find part-time work).

Recently, I she started behaving funny, being generally unpleasant, and then I found out she was flirting with some guy at work. We broke up, and she's going to go sleep with him now.

The thing is: she has most of the money. It's hard to say why, because we really, really didn't keep track of expenses. I know I bought her considerably more expensive gifts over the years, there were periods I was paying more of the rent, etc., but somehow I currently have nothing. I think most of it disappeared because I was paying small bills with no income to my bank account over the past 18 months, while she paid big bills, but at least had a steady account due to working. The main expense, rent, was paid exclusively by her.

The split is $1200 in my account, about $12k in hers, plus she legally owns the car that we share.

So: am I entitled to any of that money? Technically it has been far from a 50/50 split for the past few years, but there was a mutual understanding that it was OK for me to leave my job and look for part-time work as we were trying to set ourselves up for our future, so Uni was more important (I graduate in six months by the way, what timing!). Am I entitled to any money?

**TD;DR:** Broke up with girlfriend of seven years. For first 6ish years we paid no attention to who paid for what and treated our money as combined, but expenses became unequal for the last 18 months. She now holds most of the money. Am I entitled to anything?

 Half-Life 3 was a given

I don't think so. For a while, we were simply waiting for Episode 3. Since it took so long for Episode 3 to come out, people began speculating that it must be Half-Life 3, because there is no way they'd wait all these years and just release a small followup to Ep 2.

No one really knows what happened internally though. Maybe they wanted to make Ep 3, but changed their minds to HL3. Maybe there never was meant to be an Ep 3. Maybe they purposely decided to backbench HL3 to work on more lucrative projects. Maybe they simply kept delaying it for one reason or another and realised one day "oh shit, we're sitting on another Duke Nukem Forever".

Valve is too secretive and we don't know.

However, at this point, working on Half-Life 3 definitely would be 'going back' as it's a project that's been in limbo for awhile, not something they've been consistently working on.

 So basically, I'm a short male (5'5'') and quite skinny (57kg). I've never owned a suit before and no stores in my area stock suits that will fit me (a blow to the ego!) but I need one for my new job. 

I decided to buy online, but since I can't find suits in store nor do I own a pair, I don't have any measurements.

So my question is basically: where do I measure myself and what are the most important measurements to look for? 

Additionally, will there be a high degree of consistency (if I measure X and the store says X is there still a good chance it won't fit due to variables in body shape, size conversion between countries, etc).

I'm Australian and looking to buy from a British website (Asos) since they seem to have a good return policy and lots of smalls and extra smalls.

Edit: Forgot to specify, mostly looking for the suit jacket as I already know my pant size.

Edit 2: Just occurred to me, suit styles may affect the answers? What would you recommend for an accountant in terms of style? Am I overthinking at this point? 




 What a fat fucking cow, please never post her again. 




 Why do people post this shit. 




 And how is this reconciled with the fact that male/female brains (to my knowledge) are on a spectrum, not simply a male brain and a female brain.

 No idea about secret questions, tried it and couldn't remember. Phone number is for a number neither of us use anymore 




 Some of you will want backstory, so here you go: Long story short, my ex-wife locked me out of our joint gmail account. There are important emails on there as well as photos of when I took out scene overseas that she claims she will be deleting. I do not put this past her. I have spoken to a lawyer about getting a court to demand she give me access, but I'm worried she will delete important emails by then. My best chance is a keylogger, although I fear they're already gone.

I understand I can maybe recover these emails by contacting Google, but I sincerely doubt they're give them out.

tl;dr: Need keylogger to steal access back to a join email account. It does not need to be amazingly discrete, she will not think to look. Just something that won't have any popups, doesn't show up in taskbar/task manager and so forth. I can circumvent antivirus software myself, but one that doesn't appear there either would be an extra bonus.

Edit: Bonus points if it can run itself at startup without anyone knowing.

 It happened awhile back. He was talking with Australian troops on TV, one of them told a story about a soldier (or soldiers? memory is a bit fuzzy) dying in war (might have been his friend?). Tony Abbot's response was "well, sometimes shit happens".

He got a big backlash for it and his PR response was that the quote was taken out of context (you can watch the video and decide for yourself, but it clearly wasn't). 

This news reporter was confronting him about it and asking him to explain the 'context'. Abbott realises he can't, and for some reason acts like a child by bobbing his head. He can't admit he's wrong, but can't find a good excuse. 




 You can condition most animals to respond to any sound. I can get my rabbit to come to me by making a clicking sound with my tongue. 




 The only reason I'd be hesitant to do this is because he'd probably chuck a hissy fit and you'd need to find someone else to certify your marriage.

 Damn! 









 So I have a legit copy of Windows 8. I plan on taking advantage of the free upgrade to Windows 10. As I understand it, as long as I upgrade to Windows 10 in the first month, then it's mine for free forever?

My question is, if I decide to fresh reinstall from my Windows 8 disc, say, 13 months after the free month ends, will Microsoft know that that copy of Windows 8 has used the free upgrade for Windows 10, and allow me to get it for free then?

I guess another way of asking this is: is it free forever and linked to my copy of windows 8, or is it simply free to acquire for this period and thereafter I will have to pay if something goes wrong with my drive?

I ask because I happen to be having drive issues at the moment. 




 For example, I'm browsing Reddit and GameFAQs flawless. I can Google search just fine and I'm downloading a game on Steam.

However, most websites return[ this message](http://i.imgur.com/NeyK7eF.png) (including Gumtree, eBay, Paypal and others).

Disconnecting and reconnecting to my Internet connection (through router settings) seems to breath temporary life into my connection, causing some (but not all) of these websites to work again - although usually they won't work. It's often the same set of websites, but not always, that give issues. It's the majority of websites that DON'T work. Occasionally I crawl to a snail's pace even when everything is working.

This has been happening for months. There are periods where it will be like this for days or even a few weeks, followed by periods of flawless browsing. I have replaced all the hardware (router, cords, filter, etc) I can and tried multiple browsers and devices (the websites that don't work are usually consistent between theme).

Finally, sometimes pages will just partially load - usually a lot of text on the far left side of the page (basically, only the text loads with no formatting or images).

So... what's up?

 A master of CQC vs the billionaire detective.

**Round 1:** Bruce vs Snake in a hand to hand fight, no weapons, no armour. First to surrender, die or become knocked unconscious loses.

**Round 2:** Stealth. Batman and Snake a placed in the woodlands at midnight. Snake has his camo suit/tranq dart, grenades, guns and other gear - and Batman his suit and basic gadgets. First to 'tag' the other person wins (this can be accomplished by sneaking up on them and touching them, hitting them with a batarang, tranq dart, etc. Basically just 'get the drop'). Who is most likely to succeed).

**Round 3:** Two identical Metal Gear Rex's are on the lose, wreaking havoc. Snake hunts one, Batman hunts the other. Who defeats their Rex first? They get the same gear from previous round (can't call airstrikes in or Batmobile, etc). 




 I'd be ten times worse. 




 That's different because they were cheating by allowing an outside participant without using Phone a Friend.

If they use phone a friend there is no problem with them Googling it. They even addressed this when they replaced Phone a Friend (it's now Ask An Expert or something like that) by saying a lot of people were Googling so it was spoiling the point of the lifeline. People have done it for ages with no consequences. It is allowed. 




 then to mention there is no type of matchmaking at all so you need to fight anyone you randomly find

True, but this gripe isn't For Glory specific. In fact neither is the point about lag. 




 Then your issue is with pay inequality.

Let's say in an alternative universe, Sting earns the exact same amount in an upfront payment for writing the song that he would have received in royalties up to his death in our universe. Are you still complaining about his pay being too high? If yes, then royalties aren't the issue - you just don't like the earning potential of musicians.

If no, then your point doesn't make sense.

You're literally just disliking a specific form of compensation. Removing this option will have serious consequences on the economy, potential business contracts, copyright law, etc. Hell, royalties are also really aren't that much different from rent. You make something, then you live off that investment. I guess renting houses shouldn't be a thing either.
 




 I have almost completely negligible lag, is it really that big of an issue with others? 




 For Glory in general at that. I might be wrong, but it seems to be the consensus online that For Glory, particularly 1v1, is bad.

It seems odd to me, considering this is typically considered to be the 'competitive' mode. You don't see people complaining about standard layout Chess matches being bad because of tryhards, etc, and advocating for random starting positions or other variations that often.

Not many people want to see games like Dota 2 or CS:GO become casualised.

So why does Smashbros draw so much ire towards it's For Glory modes? 




 I don't think so, since it's asking for examples rather than asking for coverage of a specific period (eg. "Was there civilizations that did not have gods?" vs "What was life like in Medieval Europe?" (which covers many centuries and locations)). 




 http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/633202-super-smash-bros-for-wii-u/71888639 




 That's [blank] af. 




 The royalties are part of the pay. Imagine how badly you'd damage the economy of royalties couldn't exist. It's part of the overall compensation package for the work you did, you just get it later and it's a potential gamble. I'm fail to see how it's pay for doing nothing 




 How is it an issue that she hadn't heard of them? Who cares?

 As others said, it's not perfectly lined up with months at all.

However, even if they were, it would just be a coincidence. When there are millions of man made concepts and millions of biological functions, it's not that farfetched to think a few variables might line up. 




 Most girls aren't even 28 days. my girlfriend's are 22 days apart.

 But that has nothing to do with the argument. Of course there can be successful projects without crowd sourcing... The point is it brings things to market that otherwise wouldn't exist. It adds options for creative or ambitious people to raise the necessary funds to create things people will enjoy

 Crowd sourcing gives the ability for them to fail in the first place. Without it, games like Yooka Laylee and (I believe) FTL would never be given the chance to fail in the first place. The average person cannot raise the kinds of funds without some form of external investment.

Traditionally, this is capital markets or bank loans. Now we can add crowd sourcing to the list. 

It doesn't encourage laziness anymore than convincing some wealthy investors to give you money and squandering that. Either way you are ruining your own reputation and wasting resources provided externally. The encouragement to not be lazy is wealth.  




 When you form a company, you are often not the one investing either... This is why many company founders are often CEOs and not actual owners.

Crowd sourcing brings products to market that may not otherwise exist. They also do not require any given individual to bear a significant portion of the risk of the product/company as opposed to traditional investing. 




 Also, your notion of getting what you want by working hard isn't true of capital markets that already exist. Having a profitable idea gets you what you want, not working hard. Very few products available for purchase are self funded 




 It's just a form of investment.

Capital markets have allowed technology and the quality of life to explode. 

Crowd funding isn't much different. Except the potential return/reward is a new product on the market instead of dividends.

Games like Yooka Laylee would not likely exceed of it depended on investors from acapital market, since they're riskier than CoD 18.

It's a fine system that is currently a little too open to abuse. But certainly not 'lazy'
