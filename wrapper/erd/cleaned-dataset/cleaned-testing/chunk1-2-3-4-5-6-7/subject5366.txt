 Sept. 24. Duncan's family members tell U.S. authorities this is the day he first felt sick. That is when he likely became contagious.  
 Sept. 26. Duncan seeks treatment at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas and is sent back to his sister's apartment with antibiotics.  
 Sept. 28. Duncan is transported to the same hospital by ambulance. He is critically ill and put in isolation in the hospital's intensive care unit.  
 Sept. 30. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirms that Duncan has been stricken with the Ebola virus, the first patient to be diagnosed in the USA.

 Ya, you do need to do your homework, consult a lawyer, know what to negotiate, etc.  
Once they file that 1099C cancellation of debt to the IRS though, you should be in the clear. 




 These debt collectors will settle for pennies on the dollar. Maybe a few more pennies than they paid for the loan, but they'll normally be willing to negotiate before going to get a judgement. 




 Nope you shouldn't have to, as part of their jobs though they will ask.

 It depends?  
Action combat can be fun, but it can also get repetitive, tiring, and boring as well. I suppose if combat is as dangerous as it sounds, you may not be fighting something/someone every few minutes during your gameplay, mitigating some of the cons.  
Personally I miss the pre-teamspeak days, where combat was slower,  you actually typed commands to your teammates, and allowed for more strategy rather than the current 'maximize button presses per minute, dodge when you see a swing' tactic to overcome your foes.

 Can we talk about why [Dark Elves](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/everquestnext/images/7/74/EQNConceptDEMale.jpg)  dont need horns next? /s 




 No way about it, this hasn't been good for the game/franchise.  
When they spend pretty much all of the [Landmark Live broadcast](http://www.twitch.tv/landmarkgame/v/3801401) trying to explain 'it's going to be ok', it's depressing. I've been through cuts like that, it takes time, like mourning a lost friend, to recover.

 Everything feels so rushed compared to other take-overs I've seen or been apart of. They don't even have an official logo and their website still has SOE all over it. It doesn't leave positive feelings for the future of the studio.

 I guess I'd respond with, sure bag/bank slots or costumes are great and all, but why spend time designing those items and then NOT give them in-game as recipes to help your crafting patrons.  
Stuff in cash shops like that usually just undermines social aspects, why ask a friend to craft you a larger bag when you can just plop down $5. And then it hits you, that had to be determined pretty early in the design doc's and you start to wonder if the devs really are making a game and not just a cash machine. I understand they need money to keep the lights on, but sometimes I just scratch my head at the things lost with pay-2-convenience. 




 thanks for the laugh op

 Welcome to the Corporatocracy! 




 You won't be able to turn off automatic updates in Win10, all you'll be able to do is schedule restarts.  
You can't be trusted to keep your PC secure so they'll do it for you, check out the Win10 preview and the talks last week from Ignite conference. 




 Free forever!1@!!#1!!1  
Being free forever will undoubtedly allow for adware/spyware and other 'tracking' happening behind the scenes whether you care about it or ignore it.  
OneDrive, Skype, the Store, the Camera app, and a handful of other things are un-installable (disable only lol) permanent back-doors.  
Not to mention the forcing of auto-updates, can only pick what ring you want to be on slow/fast and when to schedule reboots. They don't trust anyone, including sysadmins, to get the patches out so they'll do it for you, ya know for 'security'. 




 hahahahahaha

 Ya, I read some more and you're right, you can't just load an apk.  




 Wonder if this means apps I've already bought on Google Play   extracted using Apk Extractor can then be loaded on a Win10 phone without having to buy them again thru the windows app store. I guess as long as they're not tied to google play services it should work.  
Then which apps would I want to run on my PC, hmm.

 Not sure why you're downvoted, although to be fair Nintendo does own a majority share of Game Freak. Those other 2 pay-to-play games and the recent Mii Plaza changes on the 3DS ($5 to upgrade the plaza and $5 for each of the ~5 non-free games, that ALL rely on Streetpass) isn't a good sign.  
Nintendo is learning from the big boys and it scares me. 




 Caution, mounting whales causes building collapse. 




 Go GOG.com! 




 Steam, where you are only renting the privilege to play a game cause you don't own shit in this digital DRM ridden era.

Well you don't today but can you predict the future?
 




 It's the hair we deserve, but not the hair we need right now 




 That's what she said. 




 Really, they are bombing in their pre-launch alpha   beta phases now. After players get in and see the dull and lazy writing on the wall, they're gone (See TESO trying to entice its masses of beta-players to try live this weeked). They could care less about it 'only being alpha/beta', when we've seen time after time, promises of miracle patches and countless bugs reported but never fixed before launch, etc.
