 For me it's AC2/Brotherhood and Revelations. AC3 had some good tunes, however for me AC4 as largely unforgettable as I wasn't big into the sea shanties.  




 Dat scream....scared the living fuck out of me. 




 Executor: 1.1 billion credits then gets taken out by a lowly A-class starfighter, classic. 




 Is this the first time she has been topless in a role? 




 It was also titled [Star Wars Underworld](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Underworld) it seemed to have a pretty awesome premise. 

"Basically, it is like 'The Godfather'; its the Empire slowly building up its power base around the galaxy, what happens in Coruscant, which is the major capital, and its [about] a group of underground bosses who live there and control drugs, prostitution..."
Rick McCallum

Personally I think it would be an amazing on HBO if they put in a similar 10 episode season like they do with Game of Thrones with a similar budget as well, however the chances of that happening are nil since Disney own the ABC network which they would most likely produce it on. 




 Just curious OP but what exactly did you find a little offensive in this? 




 Look i'm sure that the production of ANY tv show is not "lazy" but don't you think in Australia  that all the free to air networks in Australia are over-saturated with reality tv shows? It seems like every network is just chasing after each other when one network has a successful reality show. Just my 2 cents as tv viewer. 




 Is there a guide for what kind of paper should be used when printing video game covers? 




 I actually think this would fit Ridley Scott perfectly, combined with a good screenplay of course *cough Prometheius cough*. If the film follows the first game and is set in the 12 century I feel that he could absolutely nail the look and feel of the setting as well as the sci fi elements. For reference I think people should check out the directors cut for Kingdom of Heaven as it is set roughly in the same time period as AC1 and gives a good vision for what he could achieve. 




 Recognise that yellow anywhere. 




 Serious question but how are you actually supposed to see out of the back? Does it have a series of cameras or are you just expected to never drive it on public roads and only take it to the track? 




 OP can you tell me what the pads you have under your wrists are called? 




 After coming from Titanfall to BF4, I have found myself getting caught on everything. 




 If they do it I hope they make it as unique as the [Tron Legacy Disney Castle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBN-Iolxa1o) was! 




 That's CNN for you. 




 Cheers mate much appreciated! 




 Any chance you could upload that tune somewhere for me to have a listen? 




 I was originally like you and asked myself whether the show would be too childish etc. Then I decided to watch it from season 1 to 6 and honestly it is fantastic. Sure there are a few dud episodes and some story arcs that appeal more to children than adults but the underlying theme of darkness is present throughout the series and man does it get dark especially in the latter seasons. Seriously do yourself a favour and watch it. 




 Looks kind of like a gigantic space jockey from Prometheus or Alien. 




 I have the same kit as well it's currently sitting on my shelf! Unfortunately though the stickers have been flaking off for some time now since I neglected it when I was young and I dont know if I would be able to get replacements :( 




 Apps are basically the same price as their US counterparts. I remember originally IOS apps being more expensive. A 99c app on the US store would cost $1.60, however in the last few years apps have gone down to 99c on the Aus store.  




 I just really hope they overhaul the entire free running system it just felt so dated and clumsy in AC4. It needs to feel and look more fluid as well as have a better sense of momentum when you are running. Other than that the other main improvements need to come in the form of A.I hopefully now that's only next gen they can improve the A.I due to higher memory.  




 I think of the ratings as more of a guideline. I was fortunate that my mum or dad didn't care about what I played too much and was able to get away with some pretty gnarly games at a young age. For example I got GTA 3 on PS2 when I was in Year 4 of primary school. I look back on it know as my parents being a bit naive but also as a sign of trust in that they raised me correctly and made me work for these games. I'm not saying that your mum is completely wrong in not getting you the game but I think showing that you can handle mature themes, ideas and concepts which transcend the idea of these artificial ratings, it will go along way with your mum. My 2 cents though I'm sure many people may disagree with me. 




 I actually quite enjoyed the theatrical version of the film when I saw it, even if I didn't quite understand the plot at times it kept me intrigued. I was curious if anyone has seen the directors cut and if that is the definitive version of the film? 




 Got 7 noms that year and didn't win a single one. 




 There was a lot of nice detail in this clip from the coffee swirling around in the cups to that guy lighting a cigarette almost had a very slight inglorious basterds feel to it. Of course the fact that they were speaking German was also a very nice touch. 




 He kind of looks like a character I would create in Oblivion or Skyrim. 




 It seems he went full retard.  




  Sony have already said that the price of the PS4 was not finalized until E3, and that they were prepared to sell it for less than they are in order to undercut the Xbox One, which was their ultimate goal from the start. When Microsoft announced their higher-than-expected pricing, Sony execs breathed a sigh of relief. This was all discussed numerous times in a wide variety of interviews with several Sony execs. The prices were not known to anyone outside of these two companies until the announcements were made.
 

I don't think Respawn chose to make it for the Xbox One as many developers with Respawn have stated that they are upset that PS4 owners won't be able to experience the game since they want it to reach as many households as possible. It was a very corporate decision to keep it to the Xbox One. 
 




 Even then would that cover the long term sales of lost game/dlc sales for the PS4? 




 Sorry but even MS will never pay a stupidly high amount for Titanfall 2. The only reason Titanfall 1 was a console exclusive was because a former EA executive thought the Xbox One would dominate this gen. EA are pretty much kicking themselves over this though since the PS4 now has the higher install base. So essentially MS would have to pay the equivalent of what EA are losing in potential PS4 sales and that would simply be too high for MS to pay. MS would most likely want to put that money into their own IP's such as Gears or Halo where they know they will get a substantial profit instead of splitting up the portion of these profits with another company like EA if they made Titanfall 2 




 While this wasn't the first game that got me into gaming, it was the first one that got me into RPG's. 




 Happening to me as well, so fucking annoying. When you want to watch a simple youtube video it fucking greys the screen asking if you want to use your G+ account, seriously G+ can fuck right off.  




 Does some of the score sound like it was taken from The Social Network film? 




 Looks like a Victoria plate in the pic unfortunately.  




 It didn't help that they showed all the episodes out of order AND kept having multiple breaks between episodes. 




 With that topic I would like to point people to the [Angels and Demons Teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7YrwBYezWM) which I thought was excellent.  




 Is it possible to get this as a 1080p wallpaper for my desktop? 




 I have heard that the majority of the film was cut down and it's easy to tell after viewing the film so I was wondering if anyone here had managed to see the full length version at any press screenings etc? If so did it hold up to the original film? 




 What about [The E3 2009 AC2 Walkthrough](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pIw4M4_ufI) this opening section was not even in the game and it looked really nice as well:/ 




 Which game in the series did you feel have the best soundtrack? In my opinion it's easily AC2 and perhaps Brotherhood. Jesper Kyd nailed the atmosphere and mood of the game in his soundtrack!  




 Otto is Otto backwards, whoa. 




 Yeah it was such a load of bullshit. Was there any specific reason as to why they just didn't use PSN? 




 Creating a Konami ID for the beta and then updating the game. Good times. 




 Man me too I actually put a decent time into the game but I sucked massively also I don't remember how the ranking worked in the game but was it just me or did it take a million years to actually rank up the skills in the game? 




 I enjoyed the movie for what it was however I did feel they overdid it on the slow mo. I also felt that the computer generated blood took me out of it a bit.  




 He has the look but I don't think he would be able to pull off the character though. I'd like to be proven otherwise though! 




 If this does happen I guarantee the ending will not test well and they will change it.  




 This is gonna be a weird one but for me it was Gattaca. It hit me hard for some reason because when growing up my brother was pretty much better at everything compared to me so the scenes of of Ethan Hawke's character striving to be better really hit home for me.  









 Do the lights on the case not become distracting when playing the game? 




 I'm not entirely surprised by this actually I flew back from Hong Kong to Sydney via Qantas airlines and the guy infront asked the steward if he could smoke a cigarette (this being after the countless reminders saying you can't). She gave a stern no and looked confused herself.  




 So basically a G-Diffuser is the only thing keeping the plane alive. 




 Odd I have never the old 7 series without the navigation unit inside.  




 Seems like they had kind of sobered up for the most part before burning the house down.  




 For those who don't know the original [Alien trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjLamj-b0I8) is what the Prometheus trailer was based off.  




 I was in the exact same situation mate a few days ago. In my opinion its best if you don't lock onto the dragon and get some distance. It basically has a tell for each move its gonna do when it lies down flat it basically means its gonna charge and when it does you can easily manouver around it and get a few hits in on the tail BUT you have to be cautious because you need your stamina to gain distance again when it starts bend over again. It has a move in which it will vomit up all this acid on the ground which can spread in a rather large radius but you as long as you are far away from him you can avoid it although if you get hit it will reduce weapon durability. You can tell when he's gonna do the acid move when he starts do this regurgitating animation from what I can remember. 

Basically just don't lock onto him and keep a lot of distance and monitor how he tries to attack you. It takes a while to get his HP down when you're only attacking his back side but it's the safest way imo.  




 Can the door operate individually to the roof? 




 I think the [Matrix Opening](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIXNpePYzZU) for me has the best WB logo. Just the music, sound effects and green colouring takes me back.  




 I wwebsite as on the internet when you were a sperm in your daddys balls and before it was the internet 




 I'm glad that I am not the only one who picked this up! I actually quite like this angle gave a nice soft look to that specific scene. 




 To be fair you would be surprised as to what the human body can endure in certain circumstances. It's not out of the complete realm of possibility for Shelby to have had a pulse but be completely unconscious.  




 In Australia it's subtitled as Rise of Electro. The trailers and posters they have in the cinema both have that subtitle.  




 True that it does seem like a pretty revolutionary car, curious to see if they would make an even faster variant of it, perhaps an i8M or Mi8 if that doesn't sound too silly haha. 




 My bad completely forgot about that one!
 




 Fantastic tune, cheers mate! 




 Did this episode remind anyone of The Last of Us? The raiders in the house acted very much like the hunters you face in the game, and when Rick takes down the guy in the bathroom it looked very reminiscent of something you would do in the game.   




 Now I understand that supercars are a very expensive investment which sees very little return, however the idea of BMW making a supercar which has their performance pedigree gets me wet to say the least. Perhaps something like [this concept](http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18xpnwxs9ixyzjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg) 




 
Paris: "Yeah they like totally broke into my house".

Producers: "Thanks Paris we got what we needed to make the film now". 




 So does Mclaren actually not have a title sponsor for this year? I think the car looks fantastic without a bright contrasting sponsor plastered all over it like last year.  




 Also right hand drive.  




 Jiffy! 1:44-1:47 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn3PQJ9PHLY 




 I just love the fact that they actually use the phones properly in the show. They don't super impose some stupid interface that makes silly sounds over the phone to get their point across. Instead you get the real deal. I especially love the graphics they use on screen when the characters text each other.  




 I've been thinking his name was Beechum the whole time... I am not a smart man. 




 Apologies if this has been asked before but why didn't Michone take one of the vehicles left over after the Governors raid? She walked past a bright red Jeep that was on the grass in the prison I am assuming worked since it would have been driven there by one of the Governors people.  









 Ages ago when I was really young we went shopping so my older brother could get some new shoes, his eyes landed on a pair of Diesel brand shoes and my dad just says. "Why don't you buy unleaded?" 









 Hey guys so basically Netflix seems to lag in the browser mode when it hits HD resolution. It lags on both Firefox and Chrome bear in mind that I am using it through media hint on both browsers since it's not available in Australia. Is there anyway to fix this and also is there anyway to try it on Internet Explorer? 




 Hey guys so i'm travelling from Sydney, Australia to Hong Kong for four days, just for a bit of a break since I am finished with university and was wondering what are some fun things to check out in the little time I have besides shopping of course :) So any bars etc people recommend? 

Cheers! 



















 So I felt that while season 2 was great it came a bit too early. Season 2 felt like series finale material. This is how I would have arranged the seasons. 

Start off obviously with Season 1Season 3Season 5Season 4Season 6Season 7Season 2.

Now this is how I felt the order of the show could have gone assuming that certain characters did not die. Obviously Season 8 does not exist in this and you may be able to exclude season 5 from this order as well and pretend it never happened.  



















 I understand the press get to see the game-play etc behind closed doors and then they get to write about it, however to my knowledge have we ever seen game-play videos from a Rockstar game before its release? 









 When this film came out I was about 11 years old so obviously I wasn't really clued in what people thought about the film. I know this though that when I did see it in the cinemas with my parents, I cried and it is still the only live action film which had genuinely brought a tear to my eye from what I can remember. I obviously didn't get the underlying themes or motifs that the film conveyed at the time but after watching it recently at the ripe age of 21, I gotta say I am quite surprised at how many people dislike it, I didn't really notice how divisive the film was at its release. 

So what how do you fine people feel about A.I? Is it a masterpiece or is it one of Spielberg's missteps? 














 Basically are there any hidden gems around the harbour that not many people know about, maybe some rooftops etc to watch the NYE Fireworks? 

edit: unpopulated places to watch NYE Fireworks? 









 There were rumours that the film was going to be re-released in a limited run to remind the academy that this film exists, so hopefully it happens as I feel that it was really the surprise hit of the year for me, in my opinion.  




 Hi guys now first and foremost I am not a heavy drinker at all, I am only 21 and studying at university so I only drink heavy on occasion to celebrate or party etc, now I am not looking to make fun or offend anyone here but my main question is why do people turn to alcohol? The reason for this is alcohol in itself tastes pretty nasty in my opinion. As in spirits like Vodka, Whiskey and other hard liquors. Do you guys mix alcohol or just drink beer etc? This is purely out of curiosity I am not looking to berate or offend anyone here. I sincerely hope that those of you who do indeed suffer from an addiction to alcohol that you overcome it!

Edited for grammar. 




 Here is the [trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTGC5Ot23KU) for those who are interested or need a refresher. Now this film was pretty much universally panned by critics and viewers alike, I just watched it last night and I am not so sure whether it deserves all the hate it got, granted it is by no means a fantastic film although it does have fantastic cinematography.  




 So I downloaded Lucid Rounds on the play store for my GNEX and was wondering how to use it, I open the app and it asks to download a zip file however nothing really happens after that. Once the download finishes I click the download in the notification tray and then nothing happens. Do I need a program to unzip it properly? 




 Do you guys feel that MGS2 is one of the more relevant games for our society/time?. With the underlying themes of digital censorship and the control of information, I feel that this game is even more relevant now than it was back when it released. 
 




 So with all the cool themes I am seeing in the /androidthemes subreddit, I was curious as to how you install these themes, sorry for being a complete retard, the most complex thing I have done to my phone is flashing the firmware to Yakju to get OTA updates.  




 Watched a horror film when I was really young, sometime in the mid 90s (the movie may have been reeleased prior) and it involved this female bride going turning into a monster and killing people. The only scene I vaguely remember was that of the bride walking along the side-walk and she comes across this kid playing a violin and then proceeds to kill him or injure him. Sorry that I cannot remember much of the film at all. It would be of great help to find the title of this film. Thanks.  









 Thought I would raise the question of films that were critically panned but had great posters. I'll start with Max Payne 

http://www.filmgrenade.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/max_payne_large_poster_2.jpg 




 Today I found a peanut butter that had expired at least 4 years ago, it had already been opened, suffice to say the contents were pretty gnarly. 




 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_tYaQVq4o 


































 So here is my pick for music that I play in EVE Online when I get the chance to play. This song just makes me feel like exploring infinitely which in turn coincides with what I love to do in EVE :D!

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwGIogQWa5I 
























 I was in Year 11 at the time but apparently some kid in grade 8 or 9 at the time took a piss in some girls make up bag or pencil case (I can't remember) because she apparently took his phone one time and sent some rude texts to some other girl in the same grade.  




 Channel 10 here in Australia does the same thing, its annoying AND they show ads in the middle of the race! The saddest part is that the UK broadcast of the Australian GP is better than Channel 10. 




 They would make a considerable amount of money buy releasing an official season pass to watch the race live on their site or through various media devices e.g game consoles (ps4/3, xbox one/360), apple tv etc. Have various camera angles that you can choose from and show stats etc on the side. That would be my dream.  




 As someone who lives in Sydney, Australia I would love to see Sydney purely for the novelty of exploring a virtual version of your own city.  




 I think IGN would have come out strong if they didn't say "officially cancelled", had they just stated that it was a strong rumour then they would have been fine but I guess they put a lot of trust into this insider, enough to say it's been officially cancelled.  




 Does anyone have a strong feeling that is some kind of marketing buzz for TLG? By saying that the game is cancelled it will remind gamers that the game was being worked on and now with Sony saying it's not cancelled the game will be firmly in gamers minds leading up to E3 




 If that's the case they should just eat right imo. You can still lose weight by cutting out the junk in a diet.  




 holy shit i'm from Sydney but even then I have never seen a monstrosity such as that! 




 Yeah I can't really remember all my choices however I do know that I made some pretty crazy decisions at the end. I would love to see how they handle the characters.  




 What's the general cost to own a basic car in Hong Kong? 




 To be fair though we actually see progress in an MGS game, they don't get announced and then show nothing about it for a long time. FFXV was announced when I was in Year 9 in high school. I am now about to finish my university degree and we still know nothing about the game lol.  




 Have they stated officially whether the save files from Witcher 2 will carry over? It will be a big decision as to what platform I buy the game on.  




 I had one where the guards were in a search formation together and I hacked one explosive at which point he threw it against the wall next to him which killed himself and 2 other guys.  




 Is it possible to see what your npc model is? 




 They could just get Harry Gregson Williams. He does the score for the games and has done a ton of films as well.  




 Everytime someone mentions Arrow F1 I think of [this silly front wing](http://cdn.carthrottle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2001-Arrows-A22-2_2714056.jpg) they had on their car at one point.  




 The sad thing is that even if you recast him the performance would have been the same since it was the writing not the actor that delivered a fairly wooden performance.  




 Where is it stated that his memory isn't wiped? I always thought that both C3PO and R2 had their memories erased in the conclusion of episode 3. 




 I really hope it's a God of War game with a new protagonist and setting. I know a lot of people would love Norse mythology to be a primary setting for a new one.  




 I have a feeling they will focus it more on Battlefront and then give another small teaser for Mirrors Edge 2 since that game is on the backburner until Battlefront is done. I'm alright with that that though since BF4 didn't exactly have the best launch so I really hope they take their time with Mirrors Edge.  




 If that's true then what would the USA do? They have a much larger sporting crowd that watch their own homesports with a lot more money involved (NFL,NHL,MLB and NBA). 




 Can Japan and Korea host it again? Since they hosted it in 2002. Is there a specific time lapse before they are allowed to host it again? 




 One thing that throws me off his not having the controller vibrate when you get an incoming phone call. 




 Wait I totally forgot about this guy? They never revealed who it was did they? 




 I believe it was to keep it in tone with the sequels. They had a more heavier green tone compared to the first original release.  




 I didn't mean to undersell her. To be honest I've only seen her in maybe 2 films, Chicago and Down with Love haha. 




 DVD's will be region locked however most Blu Ray's will be region free. I'm Australian and have imported numerous Blu Ray's from America and they have all worked fine. But yeah with DVD's you will be SOL :( I use this site to make sure a specific Blu Ray will work 

http://regionfreemovies.com/

I get that the PS4 is way more expensive in NZ than it probably is in HK however I think for warranty reasons its best to buy locally.  




 She seemed to be the woman who was in every film at one point and she wasn't a terrible actress, at least I don't think so. What happened to her career? 




 The Insider 




 You could try the Hills District. I went to The Hills Grammar School in Kenthurst and the school was located within a fairly large forest. Perhaps you could ask them for permission to shoot there? 




 I really hope the story is better this time around. The whole undercover cop thing had a lot of potential but they didn't do much with it story wise and it got fairly predictable towards the end.  




 I don't think it would happen again since the last crossover forced MK to be T rated because DC didn't really enjoy their characters getting torn apart.  




 Can anyone tell me what the legality of exploring a place like this would be? Does the council own it or is it privately owned etc? 




 If you liked Oblivion you will love Tron Legacy, it's made by the same director, Joseph Kosinski. That soundtrack and visuals are perfect.  




 Yep I was 14 when this game was announced and in Year 9 now I am in my final semester of university. Jeez this game has taken its time haha. I don't think it could live up to any sort of hype right now.  




 Holy shit that is truly amazing. 




 It's not required on consoles, it just acts as a little store where you can purchase in game items with the points you get from playing the game.  




 I've always adored the Phantom such a shame to see one in this condition.  




 I believe this is the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioLQLRwTKS8) in question. 




 I was rather annoyed that we didn't really get to explore the meat of the city with citizens walking around etc. I remember they demoed a section of the game a few months before release and it had Nillin (I think that's her name) walking around the city with it being fairly occupied with citizens going about their daily business. 




 To quote the first Blade film I have always enjoyed the line: "Some motherfuckers are always trying to ice skate uphill" 




 holy shit that's insane. I saw the film but had no idea they used animatronics. Guess it was just that good! 




 My first time I got lucky and I just hid in a car on the side of the street parked next to other cars. He ran past me several times trying to find me. 




 Yeah down for me here in Australia as well 




 Hey do we have to preorder to get the DLC? 




 I feel that Star Wars: Underworld would be a good title as that's what the title for the planned live action tv series was based off. This is just me hoping that the Boba Fett film actually follows a darker, seedier tone seen in that original 1313 teaser.  




 I think you should check it out in my opinion it's definitely above average due to the fact that the characters are just so likeable and well written.  




 Yeah I have the game running on a 5.1 Surround mix and it's pretty abysmal, however if you run it through headphones it's a lot better.  




 Usually in engine cutscenes are of a higher resolution and polygon count when making the game and with the last generation of consoles (360,PS3) you would notice that the characters and environment etc would look a lot better than when you are actually playing the game. With the new consoles (PS4,XONE) this is not really an issue and they can get the game to look as good as its in game cutscenes. Hence why even though the trailer didn't show any true gameplay we can safely assume the game would look like that come release.  




 These all look like parody posters you would find in GTA or Seinfeld. 




 300, Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven (Directors Cut), Braveheart and I would also recommend Centurion which I enjoyed.  




 It was cancelled however if I were to speculate I would say that Viceral (makers of an unannounced Star Wars title) are retooling the game and maybe will announce it under a different name. 




 I thought they announced a while ago that it was pushed to 2015? 




 How much would it cost for Valve to resubmit the game for evaluation? Or is it free? 




 Man am I glad that this film wasn't about F1.  




 The PS4 cannot play locally stored audio files in game yet. You can use Music Unlimited which is Sony's version of Spotify to stream music in game while you play. I had created a playlist of my music and was playing it while in NFS Rivals at launch. But as of now you cannot listen to your own locally stored music while in game. 




 I imagine that they refocused their time onto GTA V and perhaps are making the game for PS4/XB1/PC? I doubt the game would be exclusive unless Sony ends up publishing but that seems rather unrealistic and doubtful in this current market. 




 As far as the state of New York is concerned you ARE the Assman. 




 It's just Maybach* haha and yes it had an electrochromic glass on the sunroof if I recall.  




 While RUSH (2013) sits on an 89% rating and 8.3 IMDB rating, I felt it was one of the films that sorely got overlooked especially during the Oscars. You don't even have to be an F1 fan to appreciate the film. Truly amazing in my opinion and Daniel Bruhl (Inglorious Basterds) kills it as Niki Lauda.  




 As someone who lives in Bella Vista, The Hills area in general is pretty chill, probably a lot more Christians in the population due to the advent of Hillsong Church which is kind of one of those youth mega churches you hear about in America. My uncle has a house in Castle Hill which is located on a street with other massive houses. His house was built in the 80s though so that street has old but massive houses which all border a fairly dense forest. The people are quite nice for the most part, definitely a welcome change compared to people around or near the city in my opinion.  




 I highly doubt there will be a teaser for TLOU shown. If the bolded parts of the leaks are true then I believe that they would show The Last Guardian at the very end of the conference kind of like a "but wait here's one more surprise" and boom they show The Last Guardian.  




 Amazing! 




 That's fucking retarded if that's true. Seriously he's a lawyer not a fucking bad ass super cop. Should have cast someone with less of a pull on the film.  




 Man of Steel felt like the closest thing to a real DBZ film. 




 This is such a fantastic show it really is in my top list. Great story which is now even more relevant in the whole recent NSA scandal which they tied in perfectly and fantastic characters.  




 Love the MP3 controls, seems like the kind of character that would want to listen to music while swinging around. 




 Auto updates and doesn't need the disc to update. All of my PS4 games are retail and I haven't had to put the disc in to update/complete the update of  game.  




 Australian citizen here, Jeep Cherokee's have always been quite popular here and I have also seen quite a few Chrysler 200's around. While the most common car you see here is a Holden Commodore (Chevy SS). Importing a Mustang, Corvette, Viper or Camaro is uber expensive as you have to get a RHD conversion and I imagine servicing the car would be stupidly expensive. Personally I love the designs of all 3 of those cars, it's just a shame they are so expensive.  




 So I have been rocking my Galaxy Nexus since 2011 and I want to upgrade to a Nex 5, is the battery life a substantial improvement over the GNex? Reason I am asking is that I know the battery life of the Nex 5 compared to some new phones such as the HTC One M8 and Galaxy S5 isn't the best but if it's a massive improvement over my G Nex it'll push me more towards it.  




 No, I have a 2013 328i with an M-Sport package and the only things that denote anything M-Related are the door sills, wheels and steering wheel. There is no external M badging on the body of the car.  




 I actually like this scene would have been nice if they remastered it and included it in the blu ray cut. Your score is excellent btw. 




 Glad that didn't happen it would have been too much in an already long film.  




 I use Xbox Music on my Surface Pro 2 and while I also have my entire iTunes library on the computer I mainly use it because the UI is a lot better + you can import your entire iTunes library into Xbox Music (at least on the sufrace). It pretty much functions like Spotify so I am just on the free account which lets me listen to pretty much anything except their are ads of course.  




 I like that this is a more contemporary looking UI compared to The Machine's UI, in a way it feels more threatening compared to The Machine. 




 Ohhh right wow haha didn't know that.  




 Wait what it's not my birthday though :( 




 I assume Cameras/Film/Music and PlayStation 




 Ben Afleck? 




 Anyway to view said videos on the PS4? E.g Can I copy a movie over and watch it on my PS4 yet? 




 Press X to chainsmoke. 




 Can't blame them, a dark period of fashion was fast approaching. 




 I wouldn't mind seeing some of the themes the Clone Wars explored, mainly being that grey area of dark and light. It raised very valid points about the Jedi order being power hungry and controlling in their own way. I think Knights of the Old Republic explored these themes extremely well through the character of Kreia. It made you look at the force in shades of gray rather than just pure black and white. 




 I'm afraid I haven't read that just yet but I plan to get on it very soon! 




 Supposedly the on hiatus/cancelled? tv show Star Wars Underworld was going to be based around a criminal underworld.

"Basically, it is like 'The Godfather'; its the Empire slowly building up its power base around the galaxy, what happens in Coruscant, which is the major capital, and its  about a group of underground bosses who live there and control drugs, prostitution..."
Rick McCallum

 




 Always liked [Dooku's](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/File:DookuSaber-MR.jpg) lightsaber purely just because it was very unconventional looking, compared to the ones seen in the films at least 




 Is the weather display on the main screen a US/Europe only thing? I don't think the Australian models do that here or have Connected Drive for that matter.  




 Probably the Matrix for me. Just really made me think bigger.  




 The marketing blitz for Episode 7 is gonna be some next level shit. 




 I like the BMW shifters. [Here](http://lifestylesdefined.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/BMW-I8-Key-Not-Just-A-Key-2.jpg) is the i8 shifter which is similar to current BMW shifters.  




 Hah here in Sydney if you look under 25 they will ask you for ID. I never get asked though and I am 22, the beard helps haha 




 I find that if you just grow a beard, wear a flannel shirt and jeans then you will be instantly cosplaying as joel forever.  




 I guess I would rather wait then have endless filler like DBZ. 




 Forgive me for doubting you but haven't they explicitly said the game will be released when it's ready, as in they haven't committed to a release date.   




 I really hope it's a new main character and cast, I would like to truly believe that Shepard's story is over. This is the kind of game that would really lend itself to next gen hardware.  




 After the Phantom Pain I hope he is able to step away from MGS and perhaps make a fully reimagined version of Snatcher or even a new IP.  




 Here's an [album](http://imgur.com/a/cNgMg) which contains screenshots  from GPU-Z and the catalyst control center which show the temperatures. Some followup I had restarted the PC which showed regular temperatures however the fan was still going into overdrive as you can see the RPM they are running at is stupidly high. 




 So my specs are:

CPU: i7 2600k 3.4ghz (not overclocked)
GPU: AMD Sapphire 6970 2gb (not overclocked)
HDD: Samsung SpinPoint F3 1TB HD103SJ	
PSU: Silverstone Strider Plus 600W ST60F-P	
MOBO: ASRock Z68 Extreme3 Gen3 Motherboard	
OS: Windows 7 Home Premium
RAM: G.Skill Ripjaws F3-12800CL9D-8GBRL 8GB (2x4GB) DDR3	

So basically everything was running fine until yesterday I decided to play some Titanfall then maybe a minute into the game the fan on my GPU went into overdrive it sounded like a jet engine. It has been doing it ever since now when I turn it on it goes into full overdrive and stays like that, GPU-Z said the fan was at 100% and the temperature was at -165 celsius, so something is defintely not right. Any help on what's going on would be much appreciated. 




 It looks like India, so yeah no helmets is standard.  




 For me it was Grim Fandango when I was younger, you had to get use the forklift in a moving elevator to stop it on a certain floor and I could never get it right.  




 Song: Enter One
Artist: Sol Seppy

for anyone curious.  




 Yeah he wasn't a bad bond by any means he was just dealt shitty scripts after Goldeneye. 




 This is a serious question and may sound really dumb but if one submits themselves into a psychiatric hospital do they have to pay for services etc after they leave?  




 Is FC4 reportedly set in the Himalayas? If true I really hope they bring in the wing suit for that shit. 




 Can they not put a different looking button though that performs the same function? 




 I imagine that generally a trophy where you have to get all multi-player unlocks or get the highest rank would be the rarest. In this case I feel a game like Tomb Raider or AC4 may have some of the rarest trophies since I can't imagine that too many people are playing those games online.  




 While it's more of a re-adaptation of the book I think Fincher's Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was much better than the Sweedish version.  




 That could be likely but SS was younger at the time and in peak condition compared to a Big Boss who was older and battle worn by the time of MG 2 




 Is it one of the Samsung Galaxy models? 




 Maybe this had already been pointed out but I noticed it for the first time at lest. In the Phantom Pain trailers where Snake is in the hospital it appears he is a lot skinnier and has lost a lot of muscle as a result of being in a coma and not being able to work out obviously. Just a small but nice detail that adds a lot to the character I think! 




 I'm assuming he is referring to Mark Webber who raced for Red Bull up until this year, he was known for having some pretty rotten luck on the track especially compared to his team-mate, Sebastian Vettell who is a 4 time world champion.  




 I was wondering why I saw Steve Irwin in my showing haha 
























 Can someone explain why The Simpsons isn't on any on demand service like Netflix? 




 I don't think so, at uni a lot of american exchange students seem to take a lot back home so i'm guessing they can't buy them there.  




 To be fair though Tim Tams are totally worth checking out. 




 Personally I really loved it because it was a more personal tale for Bond as it explored his history and childhood. A sentiment that is echoed in how M says "orphans make the best agents", which kind of makes you feel for Bond since he is a fairly cold and ruthless character.  




 The theatrical cut glosses over or completely cuts out many key characters that are integral to the actual story. The directors cut re-inserts this aspect into the film and adds layers to the developing world around the characters as well as political story threads which establish conflicts during the film. The directors cut is a 3 hour long film while the theatrical is around 2hrs 20 minutes, which gives you an idea of just how much was cut out.  




 Agree completely, the theatrical release of the film is completely different to the directors cut. 




 Was that scene even filmed? If it wasn't, would it even count as a deleted scene since it never existed to begin with? 




 Damn haha I had no idea! 




 Umm wouldn't a bike use less energy than walking or running, especially since you can just coast on a bike.  




 Hey bud try and list your other computer specs if you can!

Current CPU, GPU, Power Supply, RAM, Motherboard and of course what's your budget? 




 So is this one of the few big next gen games that actually hit its date without being delayed?  




 Looks like a set from Alien on board the ship Nostromo.  




 This one's easy!

[Moby-God Moving Over The Face of Waters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3IXg8t8Ybs)

Used in the ending scene for Heat (1995). 




 You have been living a lie mate, 4th of Goblet of Fire directed by Mike Newell and the 5th is Order of the Phoenix, directed by David Yates.  




 So how's that RPG coming along?? 




 Well the game is pretty much dead here in Australia. You can only really get a game of attrition and that's in the evenings on weekdays and weekends. Any other mode you are SOL since the population is dead. Playing on the US and EU servers isn't an option since the pings are too high.  




 I imagine we won't hear a single thing about it once Witcher 3 is released. 




 It sucks for me, I live in Australia and the game is basically dead! You can most likely find a game of attrition in the evening on weekdays and weekends but want to play a different game mode? Tough luck and playing on different servers is not really a viable option due to the ping affecting gameplay :/ 




 Oddly enough I live in Australia and Avengers and Amazing Spiderman 2 both came out at least 2-3 weeks earlier than the US. 




 Have you actually seen any of the films? 









 These cars looked so cool that year, everything looked very experimental.  




 The assembly cut in my opinion actually makes it a much better film, while it still isn't as great as Alien or Aliens it is still a fascinating film since it continues the trend of each subsequent film having a drastically different tone. I think it's worth checking out especially for the cinematography which is truly amazing.  




 I always thought that the man on the balcony was hinted at being Ziegler. However there are many theories, even a theory that he may have been the main leader, the man in red.  




 Haha ah right, yeah VB may be iconic but it is not iconic for its taste, that's for sure! 




 Haha yep! 




 Why can't EA just put the DLC on Origin instead of running it through Bioware's website :/ 




 My favourite use of that smile is when he burnt Piers Morgan in the studio.  




 Really *VB?*.... 




 The Day The World Went Away by NIN - Terminator Salvation Trailer 




 Definitely Contagion. It seemed to handle the outbreak in a rather realistic manner especially when you compare it to a film like Outbreak where they end up chasing after a monkey in the forest for the cure.  




 This was actually pointed out to me by James Cameron in the directors commentary on the blu ray.   




 These pics should be cross posted to /r/WTF and copy and paste your text into the first post. You may get a lot more responses.  




 It actually reminded me of those weird fake adverts at the start of Metal Gear Solid 4.  




 Could be Australian like me where the average adult price for a movie is $17+ 




 I'm pretty sure he is the Santa Clause that stabs Simon Pegg's hand at the start of the film.  




 I feel that all the Euro cars get it as they have intuitive knobs for controlling all your music/nav while being able to keep focused on the road.  




 Anyone here think Hugh Jackman could play a great Joel? [Here](http://images.askmen.com/1200x600/video/entertainment-and-celebrities/hugh-jackman-prisoners-interview-1085204-TwoByOne.jpg) he is in Prisoners, which is what made me think he would make a great Joel. 




 I agree I enjoyed the film. To be fair though, Need for Speed is probably one of the easiest games to adapt into a film since none of the games really feature an in depth narrative with fleshed out characters that are remotely memorable. So in that regard NFS was extremely easy to pull off since you only need to feature fast cars and cops.  




 Fillion would have been great maybe 5 or 7 years ago but he looks a bit too old now for Drake.  




 Yeah he was a miscast for Prince of Persia  but I don't think he was the main problem with the film. 




 So that means it will probably be like $1000 dollars in Australia. 




 I was a boom operator for two short films during uni, nothing serious mind you but man my arms and back were wrecked by the end. It didn't help that the old guy we had as an actor kept forgetting his lines.  




 So in the aftermath of both MH370 and now MH17 will Malaysia Airlines be able to sustain these tragedies and keep moving forward or are they already on their way out and expected to go under soon? Just curious to hear your guys opinions.  




 Cautiously optimistic, Uncharted on paper seems like a very easy game to make into a film but a lot of these easy on paper ideas have fucked up so monumentally in the past. It will be interesting to see how the Warcraft film turns out in 2016 as that is also a big budget video game adaptation.  




 What's the song you used in this vid? 




 While it's not a video, I have to say the [Jonestown death tape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkookcrAnSE) is some creepy shit. Just knowing what was actively going down in that recording is way too fucked up.   




 The performance of a youngling.  














 As much as I disliked Age of Extinction (4th Transformers film) it is a lot easier to now tell who is fighting who when it comes to the transformers.  




 Cheers thanks mate
 




 Hey what is the wallpaper on your laptop? Is there a 1920x1080 version of it? 




 Yeah I'm in the same boat man, the game was obviously quite populated at launch and a month or 2 after then I stopped playing it for a few months and now when I wanted to get back into it I can't :(  









 Man I love the look and feel of all of Michael Mann's films. Especially Miami Vice, Collateral and Public Enemies. I felt it gives it a much more intimate feel with the viewer.  




 I always thought banks were pretty strict on copyrighted images etc being used on cards. Do they just not check I guess? 




 Hey guys so I came across these short films that bridge the 10 year gap between the Dawn of the Apes and Rise of the Apes film. They are actually very reminiscent of The Last of Us from the setting to the way they are shot. I feel you guys would really like them, they are also very well acted! 









 Yeah but the question is if it's actually interesting enough to be made into a film.  




 Hey OP what's the setup for that racing wheel? It looks quite nifty! 




 Australia, ping is usually 17ms 




 From what I understand, they were reviewing the bike and the journo just fucked up.  




 Does the game scale difficulty according to the amount of players? I haven't quite figured that out yet.  




 I did Day 3 of the Framing Frame for the first time with 3 buddies on very hard difficulty (stealth) and it took so many fucking tries to get it right. That stage I feel really depends on the placement of the items and layout of cameras. Although doing it stealth and getting all the gold is worth the effort as it nets a nice $590k. It can mentally break you though.  




 The upcoming film [Fury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q94n3eWOWXM list=PLYeOyMz9C9kYmnPHfw5-ItOxYBiMG4amq) starring Brad Pitt looks like it has some very good looking props and sets. 









 I hope so. I feel that Kojima would probably want to try something new as well but he is in the unfortunate position of Konami owning the IP and he is afraid they'll run it into the ground. I would love to see Kojima remake/re-adapt Snatcher for the modern era.  




 Man I would recognise that TV anywhere. Pioneer Kuro Plasma, one of the best! 




 My face is my warrant.  




 This trailer reminded me of the [Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dk0PZMsk9ps) trailer. They have very similar looking aesthetics.  




 I have a strong feeling that it was a much cheaper effect to do the floating cubes than to have them actually transform.  




 Holy shit so this is my first time commenting on this sub and I think you perfectly described how I feel! I couldn't really put it into words until I read this, thank you. 




 I feel that makes owning a beamer even better if it's your weekend car, that way it feels extra special when you get to drive it! 




 I would recommend it as the driving in this game is pretty abysmal, I can't imagine what it would be like with a keyboard. Also combat is better suited to a controller imo. 




 Me too, I was more of a Sack Lunch kinda guy. 




 Shawshank Redemption for me.  




 For all the hate this car got it sure looks incredibly comfortable. How's the maintenance on this car OP? 




 It's on the *right* side. 




 As someone who has very hairy legs, is it worth it? 




 Any news on whether the UK/AUS release will be censored? 




 I think Media Hint isn't free anymore. Try using Hola Unblocker.  




 Hah I was wondering if this was Sydney, I felt the bus kind of gave it away even though it's blurry as hell. 




 Hahah yeah it does look like a ghetto interface, is it accurate?  




 OP what is home schooling like? How long do you get taught for per day? 




 She's actually smiling in this one! 




 Yeah almost all negative press about the film has been in regards to it's box office performance which is a shame because it's such a fantastic film.  




 Can that screen still display navigation? If so can it even be updated? 




 Does Sidwell still work for Tony? I thought he left to start up his own hedgefund. 




 Can we just talk about how unrealistic it is that Daft Punk would be having a concert.  




 Fuck me, if this is true that they are planning a trilogy in with Mass Effect style decision based choices then I am beyond stoked for this. DE:HR was one of my favourite games last gen and to see it return like this will blow my mind.  




 Hahah this where I first heard that scream! 




 From what I remember he was about to but they crashed and he was knocked out by the airbag, then waking up in the infirmary with another persons blood.  




 She said she could feel it, she felt that she had lost the power much like Cage said he had felt he lost it as well after the car crash.  




 I just checked the Ford AU site and it has this quote:

"There's a thrilling 5.0-litre V8 engine option available, but the real news is how we've unleashed Mustang-level performance from Ford's highly efficient 2.3L EcoBoost engine." 

Then it again it does say specifications will change closer to date.  




 So nothing like Batman then.  




 What kind of material are these made of? They look so weak but seem to do quite a bit of damage to someone. 




 We won't get the Mustang here in Aus though :( 




 She explains in the film that she bled out exactly like Cage did and when she woke up she had lost the power. She never said she died and lost it but that she bled out and had her blood replaced.  




 I think pretty much all these changes are for the best. The film ending can also be up for interpretation, while it isn't as directly sad as the book ending, it can still be sad in it's on way since film Cage may have almost fallen for Rita but due to the reset he realises that she wouldn't remember him nor fall for him.  




 When they tease the other 2 films at the end it really reminded me of the [teaser for The Matrix Reloaded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-URQ4sMzBvA).  




 Splitscreen is very hard to develop into a game. It requires extensive coding and testing plus it would probably add a delay to a game. Personally the amount of people who would be using split screen would be minimal and thus the effort required for the amount of people that would use it is not worth it.  




 Hahah this is actually hilarious 




 Fuck I love elephants.  




 I wonder if the film would have done better in the US if they kept that title. While it may sound like a silly title it is catchy and doesn't sound as generic as edge of tomorrow.  




 Do you guys think Mel Gibson could make a career comeback? The last film I saw him in was Get The Gringo which, personally I loved. It seems that he really isn't getting any recognition because of some off screen incidents. Personally I would like to see him direct again.  




 Are you sure you don't mean A.I? 




 So I saw this for the first time a few weeks ago and I don't really know how to feel about this one. It seems like a fairly dry film but with some seemingly cool ideas and themes. The masked party in particular was very interesting and has that perfect mysterious air about the whole situation, however I just don't know how to feel about the film overall I felt kind of empty after watching it haha. What was the general consensus for this film, it being Stanley Kubricks last film as well.  




 Yeah I generally do shoot on manual mode and got some decent snaps I just didn't know you used the stock lens to get these shots! 




 I know that a lot of people didn't like the film but I have a feeling that The Counselor may get a cult following.  




 Why exactly do they owe Sony an exclusive game? 




 Well shit I have the exact same camera and lens haha it seems now I know what is capable of my camera.  
























 Wouldn't mind hearing Muse have a crack it. As I understand, they were being considered for Skyfall. Supposedly [Supremacy by Muse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avM_UsVo0IA) was their take on a Bond song, pretty catchy. 




 I recommend Arrow as well. The first half of Season 1 can be a bit silly as it is trying to find its footing but towards the end of Season 1 the show becomes really special imo. The character development is really great, especially for a show like Arrow. Season 2 is amazing as it becomes more of a personal battle since they bring in a pretty big villain (not going to say who), they just do a really good job of world building imo especially since they are going to cross over with the Flash as well.  




 That George Costanza look alike always kills me. 




 Hey there, I live in Sydney and visited HK for a week in Jan and loved it. Realistically how long do you think the protests can go on for before the government decides to implicate some kind of martial law? Sorry if this is a dumb question as I haven't being following the events too closely.  




 This may sound dumb but I really enjoyed the mid credits sequence in Fast 6.  




 PS4/Australia/V-MAN_24 




 Driveclub, I have been yearning for a racer on the PS4 since launch, NFS Rivals did very little to fill that gap unfortunately.  




 How the fuck are two dresses valued more than an Aston Martin DB5? 




 I also thought that the shot of the Star Destroyer flying overhead was pretty awesome as well. 




 Is the term black mark specific to PSN or just games in general.  




 Nooo ad break fuck you one hd 




 While that does suck that there will be people who will just troll race, i'm actually surprised at how smooth it looks online. Usually you have racers just appearing and lagging around most of the time.  




 Yeah that was was my only real gripe with the episode. I kind of preferred the blocky looking TCW wookies.  




 So my question here is whether Disney would allow for a gritty Star Wars cable television show for a network like HBO or among that realm of quality. Something along the lines of the Star Wars Underworld series that was promised before Disney bought Lucasfilm.  




 Sorry to be that guy but I am an Australian who has started to follow this subreddit due to the events happening, can someone translate this? 




 Hopefully if the new Star Wars Battlefront will be as epic as we hope, then you may very well be able to experience it.  




 To be honest I would not completely rule out marvel picking Mel Gibson to direct Iron Man 4. They tend to go with directors who aren't huge or are obscure choices, however all of them have worked out great. Here's hoping Mel gets a big gig like this, so he can flex his creative muscle.  




 I'm lucky enough here in Sydney to watch it on the biggest IMAX screen in the world. Ghost Protocol and Dark Knight Rises looked amazing on them. Especially in GP when Cruise is climbing the tower. [Here's a picture](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Y379ux1lBg8/UFFw5EC3TwI/AAAAAAAACNw/ocDNs1BxZUM/s1600/50.jpg)

[Here's the outside](http://australia.panduanwisata.com/files/2012/08/IMAX-Theatre-Sydney-3.jpg)

 




 Ah I see, thanks! 




 So did the hiring of Claire mean that the asset in the previous episode was hired in the same way? It seems the asset had a bit more training and was more professional but given time I feel Claire may become as ruthless.  




 WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?! 




 I also have an MSI R9 280x which has been factory over clocked, however because its over clocked it does make the game artefact. Download MSI Afterburner and down clock the card using that program. These are my settings and I haven't experienced any artefacts or weird texture stretching.

Core Clock: 1020 Mhz
Memory Clock: 1160 Mhz

Everything else is left at default settings. Give that a go and see if it works. I'm currently running it in Mantle. 
 




 The script didn't really ask her to deliver much though. 




 I'm not American but the USA is a very large country with lots of people so it's not unexpected that you would see more Americans freaking out, especially when a lot of people in America have access to phones with cameras that can instantly upload said freakouts.  




 What I mean by this is the blue computer like hud interface they had. I felt it looked more slicker than the one in BF4. Especially when you're getting points/killing opponents, the way the points screen animates on the bottom really made me prefer it. Maybe i'm wrong however in that the one in BF4 just works better since it's more simpler and straight the point (been a while since I played BF3). 




 Thanks for that buzz killington. 




 God damn why can't we get something like this in Australia. I wouldn't even eat the food... 




 I don't think a list of 10 can contain this guy. Film's like Black Hawk Down, The Last Samurai, Da Vinci Code and Man of Steel are all fantastic soundtracks.  




 Knifing in BF2/2142 was the biggest shit show.  




 Haha ah right, thanks. 




 I see, thanks guys.  




 I enjoyed it mainly because Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are great in it, the story however is pretty much a misfire unfortunately. 




 I belive P.T is exclusive but the final game will be multiplatform.  




 Can someone tell me what the mask is for? 




 Can someone please tell me what this is from? I keep seeing it said in relation to fat people. 




 This game was so frustrating for me. It was beautiful and had amazing art design and it also had the setting for an amazing story but they didn't go anywhere with it. It's annoying because Killzone has such fantastic lore and characters to explore but they seem to squander the opportunities.  




 If they actually address the problems with the UI then yes. I don't really care for themes, I would rather have folders, more streamlined notifications and faster loading of the friends list/messages. 




 Man the mud in that game blew me away when I first played it, was so fun just doing donuts in the mud! 




 I remember being blown away by it when I first saw it in GT3. 




 I know that most people hated this film but I thought The Counsellor was an interesting tale as it basically shows us that bad things will happen when you involve yourself with bad people. There's just the blunt consequences and no redemption in the film.  




 I would say the Nolan batman films lean more on the realistic side. 




 This game. Where do I begin? Deus Ex:HR was probably my GOTY for 2011 and while I understand that it had its flaws, the gameplay, level design and music all came together beautifully. It is one of the games where I feel that the sequel may be near perfect if they do it right and learn from the mistakes of HR (boss fights, providing equal xp no matter your playstyle and an overhaul of the graphics). The art style of this game is amazing, the gold and yellow hues of the cyberpunk renaissance (as they call it) exude that overly lit up, light polluting world of the future. If anyone is interested here are some screen shots I had taken that further reinforce how awesome the art style simply is.

and finally my personal favourite.

[Zhao's Penthouse](http://blog.localditch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/deus-ex-human-revolution-tai-yong-palace.jpg)
 




 That's the one Batman jumps off in Dark Knight right? 




 I really loved this scene in Man of Steel and feel it was easily one of the better superhero moments in any of the recent comic book films that have come out in the last few years. 









 Every choice of song in the show as been on point in my opinion.  




 Hmm the trailer points it out to be fairly generic but then again so did Edge of Tomorrow. I'm hoping that it's actually a really smart/cool sci fi film and the trailer is just aiming to get as many people into theatres as possible.  




 I'm so torn because a Blade Runner directed by Scott with his signature visual flair would be awesome but Scott is also a director who is dependent on having a good script to make the film come together. I was in the camp of people who enjoyed Prometheus but obviously felt it was very flawed and the counselor was a strange one for me as I could not really pin the film down and how i felt about it. 




 Yep very reasonable price imo which means this will be my first AAA game to be purchased digitally on my PS4. 




 2015? I saw this like 3 weeks ago in Australia. FYI it's actually a surprisingly great film can't wait you guys think of it.   




 No that's probably due to the actual animation of the game and whatever kind of motion capture they used. It's just uncanny valley.  




 It's a whole new audience today compared to 2005. Things have changed considerably in that time frame, also Avatar had the benefit of having higher 3D ticket prices which no doubt played a vital factor in it's crazy box office gross.  




 But we already have the VW Passat in Australia, just seems really weird to be testing this car here. 




 If anyone wants to relive [the feels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkrXd37BYIA) 




 I reckon the machine has already gone ahead and set up a bunch of equipment and computers and that's what Finch is in awe of. 




 To be honest it's pretty hard to avoid trailer's these days since they show them before the actual film... 




 It still burns me on how Gearbox fucked AC:M at the expense of Borderlands. Did Gearbox ever officially comment on why the game never looked like it's initial reveal? 




 lol who the fuck would buy the 2nd cover, looks terrible. 




 Honestly dude wouldn't recommend the cross (especially because of the lockout laws), personally I am more of a bar person. There's usually nice bars around the darling harbour area also if you are into whiskey there's Baxters inn on Clarence Street although it can be a bit difficult to find since it's in an alley and its underground.  




 Where is this? 




 Yep this is the obvious one and I also love it. Watching that in 3D on opening day was an experience. Say what you want about the story but but as purely technical film it is flawless in my opinion.  




 Yep another great one. Also a shout out to Inception as well with the Japanese castle at the start of the film. 




 You could check out Almost Human although it was unfortunately cancelled by Fox and they ran the episodes out of order for some retarded reason. 




 Same here, I live in Sydney and have only ever seen undercover falcons or commodores.  




 By this I mean a scene in a big budget film, from which the viewer is first introduced to the world. My favourite is possibly in Tron Legacy when [Sam arrives onto the grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6V69KaG4a8). The music combined with the visuals make it such a treat!

EDIT: higher quality link 




 Nice fact about this trailer is that it was directed by Joseph Kosinsky (Tron:Legacy, Oblivion) 




 I might be wrong but I think they may have both credits when the director has a hand in producing the film as well or his production company has helped produce it.  









 I live in Bella Vista which is right next to Hillsong and the crowd that place draws is fucking huge! I'm an atheist but my cousin is super Christian and into these hip youth churches like Hillsong and Nexus Youth, anyway I had to drop her off into the church one day and the guys managing the car park seemingly make it a hassle to actually leave the carpark since they constantly misdirect you and ask you questions about why you aren't staying etc. Also i'm pretty sure Hillsong own the Gloria Jeans just across in the shopping center which is super popular amongst the church goers.  




 I think it will be a flat 8 




 I predict this will have hilarious outcomes.  




 That scream... 




 [Mirrors Edge soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y05wiQQbFLU) is perfect in my opinion.  




 So i'm Australian and we don't get those here, what do they taste like exactly? 




 Thanks man! I would never have found that haha 




 This is my theory at least, I feel that AI hasn't necessarily gotten less complex but we as players have been given a much larger range of skills and moves for us to use in a games which may be above the skill set of A.I enemies. 




 Is it confirmed if Deakins is the DP again for Bond 24? 




 Not sure about programming but Michael Mann's new film Blackhat is about a hacker so that could be interesting since he does a stupid amount of research in films on said subjects.

EDIT here's a [link](http://collider.com/blackhat-comic-con-panel-recap/) on the reasearch he did. 

**As part of his research, Mann started hanging out with some black hat hackers, and discovered that they can do 7 to 8 hours of coding in one go, and it creates both a sense of escapism and a bit of an opiate feedback loop.  But its important to note that its not an escape because their work goes into the real world and can create serious repercussions.

 I dunno I can respect the choreography in Equilibrium but the fight scenes just looked a bit too silly imo   




 Anyone know the song used in the trailer? 




 Man this actually looks badass! The shooting looks awesome. 




 Sorry i'm just a bit bitter that we have to have front plates on our cars haha :/ 




 So I recently rewatched both 28 days and 28 weeks later and was curious as to what you would want to see in a sequel and what direction you could take it in? Do you even think it's possible to make a sequel since it's been so long since 28 weeks and is the market even there anymore? 




 It's obviously not in the USA since it's a right hand drive car...I live in Australia and its against the law to NOT have both plates on. 




 Yeah supposedly he's back to his regular role. 




 He was not the only big name attached to the Counselor... 




 Lets be real, I'm Australian but I would still use my US Netflix account because Foxtel already license the shit out of everything so I can't imagine much content coming to Netflix Au 




 [You were drag racing?](http://youtu.be/Lyw1E8o9o24?t=13s) 




 I've had the privilege of seeing One 77 for real at the Sydney motor show. It truly is amazing in person.  




 Has the soundtrack been officially released? I can't find it anywhere! 




 I actually really liked the 3D in Dredd, definitely one of the better 3D films I have seen.  




 The only things I agree with you were the personality of the robots and the performances from the actors. The pacing however was one of the biggest offenders of the film along side its product placement. The film was pretty much 3 hours long and it did not need to be at all. Just when you think it's almost over...BAM the whole Hong Kong section begins. It did have some cool elements such as the main transformer villain and the dinobots but that was it for me really.  




 While I haven't seen Ninja Turtles yet, I feel that this will probably be true.  




 So guys if Michael Bay really does pass on directing Transformers 5? Who would be your pick to direct and why? 




 So I saw this last night at the movies. I really can't find any discussion on or relating to the film at all, is it not out anywhere else in the world but Sydney, Australia? I quite liked it although I am still trying to wrap my head around the ending and would like an explanation if possible.  




 ICO could be goddamn perfect it studio ghbili make it imo. 




 Even though the story may have been a bit predictable I still thoroughly enjoyed it. The look and sound of the film alone made it one of my my favourite sci fi of 2013.  









 Yes, this scene. I was about 9 or 10 when the film came out and seeing this scene made me really sad and scared! 




 Last I heard, Logan's Run was being written by Bioshock 1 and Bioshock Infinite's writer/designer, Ken Levine.  




 So I keep hearing on how obesity is considered to be a disease, why don't they just quarantine all fat people until they can contain and cure obesity? 




 In a way I really liked Inside Job since the bankers themselves can kind of be viewed as criminals.  




 OP Do you think you could do my PSN? 




 Looks similar to the [Cyberpunk 2077](http://abduzeedo.com/files/originals/cyberpunk_mainpic.jpg) font, which I also love! 




 Alien 3 was his first feature film and the studio essentially directed that film, he had very little input throughout the production. To his credit the assembly cut of the film actually makes it a decent film and you can see his some of his original vision in it.  




 I have only ever seen one 3GT on the road, it was like spotting some deformed unicorn. 




 We don't talk about that one.  




 Does anyone know the actual story behind this gif? How does someone monumentally fuck up like that, unless they did it on purpose for whatever fucked up reason.  




 The actual film is wrapped and they have quite a lot of effects work to finish off. Special effects can take quite a long time also they showed a small trailer of the film at comic con and the orcs supposedly look amazing for cgi characters.  




 Honestly release it on the PS4, even though I bought the game on PC I felt that the overall population of the game was cut down somewhat by not having it on another platform to build a name brand for itself. Now i'm not saying that was the only problem but they also segregated the community quite early on which lead to it being pretty much dead here in Australia.  




 I always felt that the first part of this fight is awesome. Also that music is just amazing.  




 Fucking hell! That's a lot of dosh! 
























 So guys what is your dream track no matter how unrealistic or unfeasible it seems. Mine would be Mt Panorama at Bathurst 




 Seriously this soundtrack needs to come out right now, I can't wait until the 18th. 




 Murdoch says no. 




 I can't ever see this happening to ND since they aren't a publicly traded company. Plus after The Last of Us, Sony are most likely giving them free and creative reign over their future games.  




 My download speeds also fluctuate especially if I pause and unpause to see if it changes 




 So was the bad guy in Quantum of Solace a legit threat now? 




 Hopefully they fix the download speed issue, that's my only issue I have had post 2.0. 




 This is really good man, keen to see more of this! 




 Honestly after watching World War Z, i'm surprised that bikes aren't common sense.  




 Yep same here, it's either BMW, Merc or Audi. 




 I'm pretty sure its taken from the [Force Unleashed 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umX_8cllRc0) commercial.  




 Damn I was actually starting to like this show :/ 




 I gotta say the opening [Battle above Coruscant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWoGkrt5Upg) in Revenge of the Sith still to this day makes my jaw drop.  




 fuarrk dat music. 
 




 I feel if I owned this car that I would be way too terrified to just leave it parked on a street.  




 This post kind of reminds me of the Batman Arkham games. The amount of damage Batman does to these people, they would have to be fed through a tube for the rest of their lives. Just remember Batman doesn't kill, he just turns them into vegetables.  




 Great work. Is it common for a 335i to not come standard with navigation or the screen at least?  




 [Seeing it in this bad boy on friday](http://hugontour.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/dsc02331.jpg) 




 Pretty sure that this is the least of this film's problems.  




 Well in a recent Star Wars rebels episode it is shown that a lightsabers length can be adjusted on the hilt. 




 Yeah this playlist has outstayed it's welcome. Not only did they lock it to German cars but they locked it to like 4 german cars.  




 I think it will sell well, obviously won't do the same as the last gen version but I still expect it to be one of the top selling current gen games for the year.  




 Are they releasing a stand alone film in between Ep 7 and 8? 




 You realise you just spoilt the film as well, thanks.  




 Thanks mate.  




 [Put it in H!](http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/78503/2672773-3570061943-tumbl.gif) 




 We really need private lobbies so we can just race friends or do proper club v club races..  




 I am not really tech savvy on the animation side of films but can you explain why it would be twice the work to render it at a higher frame rate?

 




 Is there a link for this video? 




 So after seeing both Hobbit films in 48 frames in the cinemas, it got me thinking as to whether 48 fps is better suited for animated films? Would it look to strange? Since there is no live action it can't really look that fake right like the first 2 Hobbit films? 




 Thanks man, kind of reminds me of the AC2 opening, the music is pretty amazing so far as well.  




 MS probably want Skype on as many platforms as possible as they would get royalties from it.  




 Video doesn't exist, is there a mirror anywhere? 




 Looks like a younger Amy Adams.  




 Brazilian fear factor had some great plot as well.  




 The film was apparently way over budget and was completely edited and re-shot at the behest of the studio. The original film had Keanu Reeves in a smaller role and Hirouki Sanada being the main character. Did you notice how the [poster for the film had that tatted up guy holding a gun over the shoulder?](http://cdn.screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/47-ronin-freak-poster.jpg) Yeah he's in the film for about 10 seconds, the original director was locked out of the editing room after the reshoots were completed. It's a shame because I think the film has glimpses of awesomeness and fantastic world building but ultimately it was corporate greed that most likely got in the way of a potentially great film.  




 Wouldn't be surprised exactly, after all we got a teaser for Intestellar pretty much a whole year before release, it seems way more likely than a Batman V Superman teaser since that film comes out in 2016. 




 The film should be viewed as is. 




 Sorry if I missed the explanation but how is Gordon able to afford living in such an expensive looking apartment/penthouse. Is it Barbara's penthouse? 




 What the hell, my game doesn't look that bad...Here are some direct captures from my PS4.

 You will find that almost all racing games have reduced image quality in the mirror since they essentially have to rerender an image twice as well as keep the textures in place from popping out as you drive along.  




 Where are you from OP? I just turned 23 this month and am in no hurry at all to settle down. I guess it also helps that everyone my age or around my age feels the same, hell my brother who is 28 is in no hurry to settle down either.  




 Seriously how do people not save their work in this day and age? How is the auto saving not working for these people? 




 The fastest way for me is still using my phone through the PS app. 




 Does anyone here know of EVE Online? It's a massively online multiplayer game made by CCP games. Basically it's a huge sandbox universe in which the stories that happen in the game are basically player created. Basically the events that have happened in the game combined with the rich background lore would essentially make it the Game of Thrones of sci fi shows. Here's a link from [Variety](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t rct=j q= esrc=s source=web cd=2 ved=0CCMQFjAB url=http%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2014%2Fdigital%2Fnews%2Fhow-the-eve-online-tv-series-could-become-the-next-game-of-thrones-1201088301%2F ei=2d9NVLWCM-XvmAW6vICABA usg=AFQjCNE64EaRrCvoMjp_E8RNGK73AACayQ sig2=hKdhYogOI1vquWr5fckE0A bvm=bv.77880786,d.dGY cad=rja) explaining what I mean.  




 The one with the Rock. The Legend of Hercules was supposedly rubbish.  




 A completely CG animated film would be quite expensive. Look at Final Fantasy Spirits Within, that was completely animated and cost a boatload of money and performed very poorly at box office and basically undid Squaresoft and forcer them to merge and become Square Enix. Now this was back in 2001, so maybe CGI has gotten cheaper to produce but I think the investment is still too much compared to that of a live action film. 




 So do you guys think that a main entry AC game will ever be set in a  future setting. Navigating a busy metropolis or perhaps a very futuristic city. It kind of seems like Watch Dogs was more of the present setting with Chicago but I think a good AC game can be made if they set it in the future. Picture a city like [Coruscant](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080610031227/starwars/images/5/5c/Coruscant_at_night.jpg) from Star Wars and sneaking into a super tall skyscraper to take out your target. Just a thought I would be keen to hear your opinions on an AC game set in the future.  




 You're not alone my friend. That is the only film to this date where I felt incredibly empty at the end, not in a bad way but a that's so fucked up kind of way since nothing good happens at the end.  




 I wonder what story idea they were going with in [This](http://i.imgur.com/GLf8cFh.jpg) concept. The star destroyer crashing onto Mustafar.  




 Man I loved the opening title credits for AC2/Brotherhood and AC3. 




 Damn I graduated from Macquarie Uni in September and it won't accept my email. 




 I think BMW have been outselling Merc and Audi. 




 Tron Legacy 
Oblivion 
Gravity
Edge of Tomorrow 
Avatar 
Star Wars Episode 3
Prometheus
Dark Knight/Dark Knight Rises

Make sure you check out the Blu Ray versions of these films.  




 Don't worry our man Jeremy Clarkson already punched him for us. 




 So am I just missing it or has there not been that much marketing for the final Hobbit film? We only have one trailer and the film comes out in less than 2 months. Compared to the last 2 films at this time of the year, there was tons of marketing for both films where as this film still only has one trailer out.  




 Is this in Sydney? 




 Wow that was a surprisingly good teaser. Looks really cool. 




  Just adding my 2 cents on the topic of Borderlands' sense of humor. The very topical, reference-based, irreverent, self-deprecating, over-the-top style is definitely NOT for everyone. For my money (and personal sense of humor), Borderlands is the most genuinely funny game series in existence. I think it's funnier than most 'funny' shows and movies. Absolutely brilliant writing, IMHO. You can tell that the team at Gearbox LOVES games- there is just fan service after fan service littered throughout

Yeah they love games so much that they just outsource the ones they don't want to make to other teams and pretend it wasn't their fault.  




 Yeah sorry I am going to have to disagree with you. Most of the humour is either just a reference to pop culture or shoe horning some meme into the game. It's a fun game but the humour is not the best imo. The funniest game I have personally played is still Portal 2. 




 It does seem like they have decent trunk space, at least the coupe does I think. They seem like they are one of the more practical luxury cars on the market since they aren't super low or have huge body kits and they also happen to be super comfy inside.  




 It really is! Michael Mann is for me one of my all time favourite directors and his choice of music is spot on in every single film.  




 afaik the xbox one version suffers the same issue as well. I think the PC suffers from it a little bit but nowhere near as bad as the console versions.  




 [God Moving Over The Face of  The Waters by Moby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTunCVWzkFA) for Heat (1995). 




 And the exact same plot almost.  




 [Stark Salvation by Geoff Zanelli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SajsLpKU7s0) :) 




 Same here brother, I just want to see Daft Punk. So i'll probably be 40 by the time they tour again haha. 




 I love that he became the CEO of Sony. 




 Anyone here from Chico that can explain why I can't bring my friends to Chico? 




 Does the fancy looking dash and instrument cluster actually work? 




 I wouldn't call this a feature but the UI is so smooth and snappy that it pretty much made me like my purchase. Of course the games are great but having a UI that is reponsive and doesn't lag makes it worth while.  




 I quite liked the film as I really enjoy these corporate conspiracy types of films. The cinematography is truly amazing as well. Great wide shots of buildings and architecture to make the corporate world truly look imposing. All in all I felt it was film that may have been overlooked when it came out.  




 Yeah I am really hoping they put private lobbies in soon, I just want to race my friends only, not these muppets who spin you out in the corners.  




 Love the piece, I really love the idea of futuristic races. Wipeout is a great inspiration for my imagination when it comes to that topic.  




 Driveclub makes it fairly loud, the last game funnily enough to do it was actually AC4. 




 Damn, upper Hengsha would truly have been glorious to look at :( 




 I remember Spielberg being attached to direct this at one point, he would have done an amazing job. Especially if you look at his Minority Report which has a slightly similar aesthetic.  




 Spec Ops The Line 




 It very well may be coming since most of the online functionality is restored I think. 




 God damn why couldn't this guy have written the screenplay... 




 What was the repair issue if you don't mind me asking? 




 Hey all I was wondering how to ONLY race my friend in the same club. Not really up to racing with 10 other people, just a classic 1v1 race. 




 Sick run, congrats! Haven't played the game in a day or 2, it's nice to see that the leaderboards are functional now. 




 Is there a gif set for the Jedi code? 




 Just play Colonial Marines, huehehehe. 




 Just curious as to why you are selling it? 




 It's worth it, I only drove on it myself for the first time on Saturday! Make sure to drive through the Royal National Forest and through to the bridge. 




 I literally drove on this for the first time on Saturday, truly breathtaking.  




 As blatant as it was, it didn't really make me cringe since his character is known to play games to unwind.  




 Wait really, I thought every country had power switches... 




 Same, played through it all to see what the fuss was about and it really was nothing to go and proclaim it as GOTY material. I don't even hear it brought up in many discussions. I guess for me it was the equivalent of an oscar bait film. 




 [Better quality of how it looked in film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLy7wZeqa4) I think the F35 actually looks quite good in the film, especially when it hovers in under the overpass to block the truck. It looks quite real in that situation, not that it would ever happen but at least they went to the effort of making it look real with the model instead of using CG. 




 GT is designed more for a wheel in mind than the controller. 




 "One of" 




 Fucking love everything about this film. One of Cruises best performances.  




 Damn what a dissapointing film that was haha, great teaser though. 




 dat enigma soundtrack... 




 Haha no worries, I was in Year 7 of high school when I first saw that teaser and to this day it was still my most re-watched teaser. 




 Personally for me it's a toss up between [Star Wars Episode III](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKZMI5tYq3s) and [The Matrix Reloaded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-URQ4sMzBvA). Such awesomely edited teasers that really got the hype train going. 




 Bought the PS+ upgrade since it was the cheapest  for me $56 AUD 




 It's kind of frustrating for me as someone who actually caved and bought the PS+ upgrade as the servers still are fucked. Don't get me wrong I have enjoyed the game a lot but those servers being down really dampens the experience. 




 I'm just curious as to how you figured the cost out that it's $9k/hr. Not doubting you, just curious is all.  




 What do you think this means for the future of BMW? Can we see more crazy cars coming from BMW to compete with newer cars like the AMG GT? 









 I would say the Grey had a very misleading moment in a trailer. I don't want to spoil it but it's pretty crazy.  




 Mines attached to a card and it shows the same shit as well, so annoying. 




 So strange seeing a holden with a vauxhall badge or chevy badge. 




 I meant the PS+ version delaying it for a while then releasing it with an explanation afterwards.  




 Damn, at least the came out and said it straight. Better now than saying that later after it was released. 




 Gonna need a source on this. 




 It could be the EU versions of the game which tend to have more languages files.  




 Kind of what I was expecting, still picking the game up regardless. It seems like a game someone is either going to love or hate, much like Alien Isolation. I think that's fine in my opinion as the game is aiming to capture a specific audience of car lovers rather than appeal to the more open world type of racer that's quite common these last few years.  
























 I belive it's called the [Mozambique Drill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique_Drill) 




 Finally, it feels that Far Cry 2 is often largely forgotten and overshadowed by it's sequels. However I still feel that FC2 was the more compelling game for me, despite its very obvious flaws and shortcomings. 

Here's a few things I really liked about FC2: 

1. **Weapon Loadouts** were a lot more realistic, you had to really prepare before a mission otherwise chances are that you will most likely die. 

2. **The Buddy System** The idea of having buddies that would help you out in combat and can potentially die was both rewarding and harrowing at the same time, even though these characters aren't fleshed out, you do feel a sense of comradare with them as they are the only characters trying to survive in the harsh African climate alongside yourself, the player. 

3. **The Fire System** It felt like the fire system in FC2 spread a lot more and engulfed everything in it's path. Compare this to FC3 and 4 and it makes them look like tiny shrubs on fire. I'm not exactly sure why Ubisoft went backwards in this regard. 

4. **Weapon Jamming**, ok this one is a double edged sword. It was pretty tense to be in a fire fight and having your gun suddenly jam, however this happened way too often. While there was a system to tell how degraded a gun was by its looks it still jammed too many times, even for guns that looked of good quality. The main issue with this is you pick up poorly maintained guns off enemies who never seem to have their guns jam on them. This was more a case of interesting design idea but flawed execution. 

5. **Time and Day** Finally, the time and day. I really loved doing missions where you had to take out certain people. It would start off with a long drive to the safe house from where you would unload your weapon cases and take what you had carefully prepared, then you take a nap and set the time progression for you to start the mission. It was really nice being able to control the time and day like that and you felt like a proper bad ass doing the set up for these missions. 

 




 What other open world games do you think do long distance detail really well? Witcher 3 may be a candidate for that in the future... 




 So Motorstorm with Driveclubs weather system and first person view point would be heaven. 




 Yep the good job line is actually perfectly delivered imo.  




 Also if that pilot has a family they are probably going to be fucked for generations to come.  




 Hey guys what graphical improvements/engine improvements would you like to see in Elder Scrolls VI. I'm assuming that ES:VI will use whatever engine that Fallout 4 will use, so I guess this question can be meant for both games. Personally I would just like to see a much less rigid movement system, the movement in Skyrim just felt super rigid, especially when you jump! Obviously graphical improvements will be seen, my dream would be to see nice volumetric clouds like you see in Driveclub, [here's an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4l39926dJ4), now I understand that it's obviously a racing game so that tech being used in an open world would be very taxing, but I think it would be nice to explore the possibility :D 




 Personally the best way to do it, assuming the Broccolis sign off on it, is to get approach it take elements from the best stealth/action games out there at the moment and add their own Bond flare to them. E.g you could borrow the dialogue system from Alpha Protocol, the combat system from Arkham perhaps with an animation set which is more suited to Bond's fighting style. This is assuming Rocksteady are actually the developers behind this game as they seem to do a good job of resurrecting video game franchises that are dead in the water.  




 "Farking idiot" 




 I really would like to see a Neuromancer film. It just seems a bit too difficult to adapt into a film though. The only thing related to the film production is this [poster](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--qiG1icHA--/184i8h6ghlbc5jpg.jpg) 




 Oh ok Flaming Dragon...fuck face 




 I don't think Nolan really does commentaries. At least not in the last films released, here's hoping Interstellar is his first. 




 The film Oblivion did another cool alternative to using green screen [Here's the video on how they projected the environment onto the set to naturally light it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DCkIuv82Q4)  














 Fucking hell, that was amazing. 




 I feel that Insurgent (Divergent 2) looks pretty abysmal. The first one was already a lacklustre film cashing in on that hunger games crowd. Now they are splitting the last film into two parts as well... 




 Which story?? 




 I feel the problem with the Hobbit comparison is that you can clearly tell that the majority of the cg budget went to Smaug. Don't get me wrong Smaug looks amazing but the look of the film is very inconsistent with some parts looking amazing while others looking average.  




 Well to be fair that's actually not a brand new Audi it's actually an 05-06 model. 




 I really liked this film. This particular film shows how much better the flow of a car chase can be when the actor is doing all his own stunts. 




 April here in Australia.  




 Yeah true that his experience on Alien 3 is probably what drove him away from big budget studio films. 




 So a studio is willing to put in $200 million to produce a Bioshock film, who do you get to direct and write etc? Would it be set in the 2007 game or Infinite's universe? Who would you cast as the main characters etc. Just a little discussion to spark our creativity! 




 Fincher would be interesting, I don't think he has really touched fantasy/sci-fi since Alien 3, unless i'm missing an obvious film he did recently. He would be a very interesting choice as he has a lot more weight with his name now and his last film, Gone Girl did very well at box office. 

 




 As a green p plater soon to go on my fulls, as scary as it sounds you tend to pick up so much more skill while driving alone. At least I did since my parents were not so great at driving haha. 




 How much did this cost? 




 Funnily enough I saw the first two films in HFR and the last one in regular 24FPS and I think I would have preferred to see this one in 48 since there's a lot more action happening in the film. I did notice some specific parts where the scene appeared to be jittery, especially during the long panning shots of landscapes. In your comment regarding the actors looking superimposed, I felt that they still looked superimposed in 24, I think this to do with the overly digital look of the film which is just a big step backwards when compared to the LOTR trilogy. Personally though I think Battle of Five Armies serves to be the one that benefits from the 48 fps since there's not much downtime during the film.  




 Supposedly James Cameron is planning to shoot all 3 Avatar sequels in 60FPS. 




 My name is hefe 




 Here in Australia it was called The Wrong Man, I feel Lucky Number Slevin is much better, The Wrong Man sounds like some shitty rom-com.  




 People may disagree with me but I am gonna say Michael Mann, I love me a good crime based film and with that distinct look he films with.  




 So basically once Ari created his new agency with Babs what is the estimate of his salary? I am assuming it was a few mil right? 




 "Having the knowledge of from the Golden age of Knowledge and being able to bring that to the Golden Age of Tech Phase II, it makes it a whole new level". 

This sounds he is talking about some RTS of some kind.  




 The one on the left actually looks awesome. Tobacco era really brought out some interesting and great liveries.  




 At least it wasn't as bad as the [DBZ Kinect trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umM0jivA4cw), nothing is that bad... 




 Do you guys think if BMW ever come back to F1 in the near future that they would link up with Williams again or would they become their own team kind of like Mercedes AMG? Was there bad blood between Williams and BMW after the split? 




 I don't think the average smart phone user is going to have a bluetooth controller though. The real question is whether it will work well enough with touch controls without the need for a controller. 




 There's actually an option to recap the story on the dragon age keep website. In that you get to create a character and make story decisions that carry over into DA:I, like the Mass Effect 2 comic. It's actually pretty great since you just export that character into the game.  




 I actually have a 2012 118i and on my registration it is classified as a wagon for some reason. 




 Damn lol thanks anyway.  




 So uhh you gonna tell us where you bought that? 









 That guy 9 seconds in nodding. "Yeah he's definitely possessed." 




 The game is completely functional now imo and is definitely worth buying. I got it and launch and still enjoyed it and now that they have added weather it is now a different beast entirely (in a good way).  




 I'm sure there's a Studio Ghbili film around here that can fit into this theme. 




 The first one Knights of the Old Republic, it's available on Steam. 




 Personally I think the character is fine the way he is since the clone wars expanded upon Boba in a sufficient enough manner that would lead him into becoming a big bounty hunter. The studio would never let him have his face covered for the whole film, so that idea is out of the question. Also it would severely limit the actors ability to portray his full range of performances.  




 This, I really can't stand that woman.  




 I fucking love when this happens followed by the inevitable "player x has left the game". 




 BB-8 aka Ball Bot 8 




 u wot m8 




 Also [Elysium](http://whysoblu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/elysium-whysoblu-7.jpg) 




 and James Cameron.  




 How does the older iDrive system hold up today? 




 For me it was Bilbo in Fellowship where he tries to grab the ring from Frodo.  




 Sorry I meant Matthew fox (guy from lost) 




 I was wondering if the studio will ever release the alternate ending for WWZ since I heard that it was pretty much finished. It would seem like a more complete film since it was fairly obvious in the theatrical cut that many characters that pop up during the film were clearly meant to have a bigger role (e.g Michael Fox's character). Will this ending ever see the light of day or has the studio just buried it? 




 [One of the best scenes in the game in my opinion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6RHg-BCk0g) 




 So I was in Year 8 when I went to see this film, not realising it would be 3 hours long. I enjoyed it but it never really stuck with me. I'm curious if you guys felt the same way in that everything felt way too drawn out and could have used a good trim in the editing room. Also do you feel the CG still holds up to this day since that was a very specific focus of the film? 




 I walked into the showroom at Castle Hill once and saw the prices for these beds, basically you are paying about 15-30k...for a bed. 




 I would say most of the cgi in Star Wars Episode 1 still hold up, especially the pod race scene.  




 Nexus 5 Android 5.0 on Telstra.  




 [You](http://s.mlkshk-cdn.com/r/2KNX) 




 New Zealand but not Australia, wot.
 




 Not to mention he has been releasing a film every year. Prometheus (2012). The Counsellor (2013), Exodus (2014) and The Martian (2015) 




 I'm pretty sure its because he was fucking sienna millers character, I think that's the idea since he managed to get out of the drug game unscathed but was undone by something as trivial as sleeping with someone else's girl. 




 Wasn't this supposed to have been released in October? 




 Don't think it's ever mentioned and I believe that was the intention, he was never supposed to be known. 




 Definitely agree. Love the inspiration for their engine sounds in all Star Wars films.  




 Shiit same here haha i'm 23 atm just graduated from uni and I swear my mum never wants me to leave... 




 Hahah yep, they do love their tron legacy soundtrack, with good reason though since it's fucking amazing.  




 I would just like to say that I fucking LOVE this film. Such a fantastic film on the drug trade. Daniel Craig kills it as the main character and rightfully so since they got him for Casino Royale after this film. Matthew Vaughn can direct man, he manages to inject a certain flavour into every scene, I can't really describe it but it just feels so well composed you know? I would urge anyone who hasn't seen this film to check it out right now! Here's two of my favourite scenes in the film both with excellent music to boot. 

[Opening monologue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_0D8F_X7us)

[The facts of life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U4aCMIBYSY) 




 End of Line by Daft Punk from the Tron Legacy film.  




 It's Thai. 




 First time I heard this was in Spec Ops:The Line, perfect use of the music, great soundtrack as well everyone should check it out.  




 I really love the idea of Kanan not being a fully trained Jedi since there is room for his character to learn just as much as Ezra, I like the idea of him not having the answers and being upfront with it as well.  




 Yeah that's true, didn't put that together. Damn shame really, I would have loved to see him have one last crack at the title in the Mclaren-Honda. 




 So 2014 is wrapped up and Button doing fairly well to get a 5th position what do you think his chances of him staying at Mclaren are? 




 God damnit seriously JB better get a seat next year, he truly deserves to have one more crack at the title in a good car.  




 [Not like this, not like this...](http://img.pandawhale.com/post-30744-not-like-this-not-like-this-gi-DBvb.gif) 




 I think I am [well versed](http://simpsonswiki.com/w/images/thumb/0/00/Big_Book_of_British_Smiles.png/250px-Big_Book_of_British_Smiles.png) 




 What were his ideas for the Hobbit films? 




 I would say the Counsellor, it's not an amazing film but I think it's an interesting one, worth checking out in my opinion. 




 I'm fairly sure she did the 50 shades version as well.  




 It's by Beyonce i'm pretty sure. 




 I always thought Daniel Crag in Layer Cake nailed it in this [scene] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy_uwF9y8SQ) 




 I wish I was old enough to see and understand The Matrix when that first came out in the cinemas, alas I was only 8 years old though :( 




 So I played through ME2/3 on my PS3 back when they came out, however I decided to rebuy ME2 on PC since I wanted the faster load times/higher resolution etc but the DLC for ME2 never seems to go on sale. It's not listed on Origin and it is only sold on the Bioware store which you have to purchase with Bioware points...seriously who thought this would be a good idea? 




 The majority here would disagree with me but fuck you anyway, I think Star Wars Ep 3 is a fantastic prequel story wise. It sets up the tragic fall of Anakin and essentially sets the tone for Ep 4. The story imo was all wound up very neatly. It would be a perfect film if Lucas wrote the story but not the screenplay.  




 Jennifer Aniston for best actress, you wot m8? 




 I think people are a bit confused since there have been so many dystopia films that have been released in the last few years that all borrowed heavily from 1984.  




 I would love to get back into this but the PC community in Australia is pretty much dead :( 




 Jurassic Park (1993) 




 The rumour was that Netflix aus will be $20/month, is this true? I already have a US netflix account and vpn so unless the catalogue is just as good as the uk/us netflix then i'm not sure if I want to switch just yet.  




 Holy shit I didn't even realise Louis CK was in this one [scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w29PG-8Tywo)! 




 According to Hans Zimmer they are actually working on releasing the track for free. Here's the [source](http://hans-zimmer.com/index.php?rub=disco id=1256) which I got from the [Nolan Fans forum](http://www.nolanfans.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=43 t=12452 start=1200) if you scroll down you can see where they discuss it.  




 Yep I travelled to Hong Kong in Jan and they had [these](http://annatam.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/IMG_3635.JPG). It really baffles me that countries which have the infrastructure and money to put these in place don't do it. 




 I have been waiting for a question like this...In no particular order. 

1. Oblivion (2013)
2. Tron Legacy (2010)
3. Avatar (2009)
4. Prometheus (2012)
5. Elysium (2013)
6. Pixar animated films as well as some Dreamworks films such as How to Train your Dragon
7. Rush (2013)
8. Cloud Atlas (2012)
9. Inception (2010)
10. Any Studio Ghibli film. 
11. Gravity (2013)
12. Interstellar (2014) whenever that Blu ray gets released.  




 lol 




 The set design looks unreal. 




 OP if you enter the code MAYHEM100 at [Dick Smith's online store page](http://www.dicksmith.com.au/markdown-mayhem-100) you will get $100 off a new PS4. Also unfortunately we don't really have Black Friday sales here, I guess the closest type of sales are Boxing day sales so basically the few days after Christmas where you can get some pretty decent deals. 




 Hmm I would say Michael Mann but then again he only has 2 films which kind of disappointed me (Miami Vice, Public Enemies). It's only because they were back to back though. I have high hopes for Blackhat since I would just love to see his take on the hacker underworld.  




 I reckon this Alfred will eventually grow into a Caine-esqe Alfred. Starts off a fiesty/bad ass and slowly starts to reign it in when Bruce probably gets into trouble during his teen/early adult years.  




 Hahah that bug for me will go down as one of the most hilariously frustrating bugs to ever exist in gaming.  




 Hey guys this is my first post on this sub but I was kinda wondering what cues do you think FO4 could take from newer games engine wise, ranging from graphics to physics.  




 [The Descendants](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1033575/) 




 I would love this but I feel that it may be a tad too dark for the network, although with that being said the latter seasons of Clone Wars got pretty fucking dark so they may be able to make it work . 




 I loved seeing this gif with flags superimposed over their faces during the world cup.  




 lrn 2 read m8 









 I think city circuit would be pretty dope as well. Something around New York, although as a Sydney resident I have always dreamed of having them race across the harbour bridge.  
























 Don't apartments usually offer a parking space that's included in the rent? 




 and learn Japanese as well! 




 Yeah I was wondering the same thing here, guess the magic of Hollywood is at work again! 




 umm here in Australia you pump your own fuel into a car. 




 I would actually love if Louis CK was in the actual movie as an android. No one would suspect him.  




 [Chris Harris driving the Hammer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzqNn8kJqQ)  




 With Inception the entire opening drools with bond-esque moments. From Leo wearing a tux and holding a silenced pistol to the entire set piece itself.  




 Ah yes Denise Richards playing the most convincing nuclear physicist.  




 It's better that FOX focus on the Prometheus sequel and then once it is done they should take a look at a potential Alien 5. At least that way whatever we learn about the xenos in Prometheus 2 is carried over without any real continuity errors.  




 I love this, very Blade Runner-esque. 




 [Deux Ex Universe is NOT an MMO](http://au.ign.com/articles/2014/12/04/deus-ex-universe-is-not-an-mmo) 




 I think this will really be the full vision of a DX game they hoped to achieve with DX:HR but because of budget and time constraints they couldn't do it. However the sheer fact that DX:HR is still an awesome game with quite a bit of content cut shows off how amazing a fully realised vision would be from Eidos Montreal.  









 Hard to say, you are condensing a 10 hour game experience into a 2 hour movie (maybe 2.5hrs max). I'm a huge fan of the series however I think it would be pretty difficult to work into a film purely because of how the story is written around the game. Not to mention the odd characters that pop up in the film which would confuse the fuck out of focus testers and the studio. I think the best way to do it is to write the film around the story and not the game if you get what I mean.  




 Superb work mate! This looks extremely professional and could fool a lot of people haha. Do you work in animation/vfx etc? 









 Curious as to why everyone hates him? 




 Not surprised at all. I think EA knows that making it exclusive to PC   Xbox really hurt their sales expectations for the game. I don't think they bet on the PS4 beating Xbox One in sales.  




 This is going to sound so fucking stupid but after watching Speed Racer, I would love to see a film based on the video game series, Wipeout. 




 I'm Australian as well but they have pretty much relaxed what food you can bring in since the consumer watchdog had a go at them for banning outsidefood and overcharging for their own food. 




 I actually really enjoyed the 2010 film with Liam Neeson etc. Was surprised that they haven't made another one, did it bomb in the box office? The chemistry between the main characters was great, seems like a missed opportunity to not make another one in my opinion.  




 Yeah I heard the same as well, at least we know it will look and sound good. e.g Only God Forgives.  




 Ah yes, this guy uploads the most beautiful night drives. Grab some headphones, put whatever music you want and just turn the lights off and watch, simply amazing.  




 Not exactly sure if it's electro/synth, feel free to correct me. Also here is the original, [Non Remixed Version ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKjtqJ-VO38), both are beautiful tunes in my opinion.  









 Ah yes I am glad I wasn't the only one who got a cyberpunk vibe from the music. The film looks really interesting as well, although I heard it did pretty bad in festivals it will be cool to see what the film is about at least. If anything it will look good and have a killer soundtrack!

EDIT: The [Symmetry Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2Rk-pLgtYE) is also awesome.  




 Thanks for the link, such a beautiful track! 




 Pretty much my experience in Dragon Age: Inquisition. It almost feels too easy.  




 My absolute favourite is the GITS Stand Alone Complex [Helicopter scene](http://youtu.be/xyDki4KhGhw?t=14s). So fucking good, the music and visuals are perfect.  




 The [GTA IV Reveal Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M80K51DosFo) also made good use of it. 




 Well he's actually in pre production on [Hacksaw Ridge](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2119532/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_1) which he is directing, starring Andrew Garfield. 




 Yep, from Australia, although all the posters etc in the cinemas said Fast and Furious 6. The same thing happened with Fast 5, was called Fast and Furious 5 on the posters etc and then Fast 5 in the opening credits.  




 Here's a wiki page on the [Blue Brain Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Brain_Project) which according to the wiki is "an attempt to create a synthetic brain by reverse-engineering the mammalian brain down to the molecular level. The aim of the project, founded in May 2005 by the Brain and Mind Institute of the cole Polytechnique Fdrale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, is to study the brain's architectural and functional principles." 




 Fast and Furious 6 was called Furious 6, i'm pretty sure. When I load up my Blu Ray it says Furious 6 in the opening credits.  




 It's CG, as for the brief scenes of it looking damaged when it lands they probably used kit cars made to look identical to the real thing since destroying 1 of 7 cars only in the world just for a film would be a terrible and stupid thing to do.  




 So in JP lore was InGen publicly blamed for the events of San Diego in The Lost World? I ask this because in this video it states that Masrani bought InGen and are still using their name. Wouldn't the public be totally suss on that or do they not know that InGen actually created the dinosaurs? 




 Does anyone here feel that superhero films in the future will feel genre fatigue and start to see less superhero films being released on a yearly schedule? I feel that there are three big video game based films that could have the opportunity to be the equivalent of the the first breakthrough superhero film (e.g Spiderman, X-Men). 

1. Assassins Creed (2016) So this is being filmed right now with Ubisoft having very close creative control on the story of the film. This is a pretty huge franchise which has the potential to earn big bucks at the box office, although the franchise has had a bad rep with gamers due to the last release, Assassins Creed Unity which was released in an unfinished state with an unsatisfying story. This one could go hit or miss in my opinion.

2) Warcraft (2016) This is a big one. Duncan Jones directing the Blizzard made franchise. Warcraft is already a huge name because of the online only game, World of Warcraft. It's a billion dollar franchise played by tens of millions of players around the world. The early footage shown to those lucky people at Blizzcon have had people excited, Blizzard have worked very closely with the story for this game so this one could be a massive hit and break the video game stigma.

3) The Last of Us (20XX) This game was personally my game of last generation. It told a beautifully crafted story between a young girl named Ellie and a much older survivor named Joel, set 20 years in the future after a terrible fungal outbreak which causes people to turn into running fungi mutated versions of themselves, making themselves crazy. This is the best game to show off a mature story and extremely well written characters which are both complex and interesting. My personal take is if this is adapted correctly, it could be a serious contender for it to be an award winner.

Edit: spelling 




 Nice I had heard some of Chrome Sparks stuff before and really dug it :) Liking Phantogram as well, cheers for the suggestions!
 




 Yep I have Zaba on spotifiy, love it! I'll check out Odesza as well :) 









 Still my favourite [rave video from 97](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMT3bRJXOo), everyone in the video is just off their tits.  




 Can cheaper drones get this kind of altitude? 




 Nice lighting and colour, where was this taken? 




 I would actually like to see him do that "impossible job" that was mentioned during the film.  




 So basically guys what features do you think GT7 should have to blow everyone away with the PS4 tech behind it? We have already seen amazing weather and visuals in Driveclub however that runs at 30FPS which is counter to what Polyphony run GT5/6 at. I imagine the cars will probably have a much deeper level of detail, however I hope they drop standard cars all together and run with premiums.  




 What happened? 




 What was the reasoning for the disallowing of that goal? 




 12x18 is perfectly fine mate, no rush :) 




 Feel the same way! When I get a new TV soon i'll definitely re-buy it in 3D. 




 Thanks mate, appreciate it! Saves me a lot of money as shipping the prints from Etsy to Australia is $15 on top of the print itself! 




 Hey do you think you could make a print for the Japan, Australia, Britain and Belgium? I know it seems a lot but if there's an easy way to do it myself I am more than happy to! 




 Would people here agree that the years for when the writers strike happened would have been pretty bad? 2008 to mid 2009? 




 Personal favourite is Recognizer by Daft Punk when [Sam Flynn first enters the grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6V69KaG4a8) 




 Here you go mate :) [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8OZpmIWcxg), [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfrHk6xdJMw) 




 Fucking loved this movie, and loved this scene especially. The music and cinematography are sublime. Was anyone else reminded of Hotline Miami in this scene?  




 I still haven't been blown away by a car chase like this in any other film. Sure there have been many great car chases since this one but none have managed to be as unique as this one in my opinion. Just such fantastic use of slow-mo as well as cars flipping over. Not to mention they built their own stretch of highway just for this scene. 

EDIT: Chase starts here [3:32](http://youtu.be/pHAm-zcXie4?t=3m32s) 









 Haha yeah, Byron is in NSW. I've should do a drive up there sometime, it looks really scenic.  




 So was this a right hand drive La Ferrari?  




 Special Operations, sounds rather mysterious which also makes me wonder why James Bond has never driven a Mclaren? 




 Judging by the Byron Bay canopy in the top right, I would say the state of NSW in Australia, however I have never seen a NSW plate that looks like this.  




 but you must not touch  




 I enjoy Michael Mann's lighting and digital camera use, I look forward to Blackhat even though it hasn't gotten the best feedback.  




 I find Driveclub pretty relaxing, just go on a time trial with it on fast time lapse and drive a point to point. Not trying to beat a fast time but just driving how you want.  




 Anyone know if it has fixed the Mantle load times for AMD users? 




 What does that mean? I can't see their comments? 









 They probably overhyped it because Gearbox showed off a completely different game... 




 One can dream, can they not? 




 Has there been any word on the what regions it will be available? You would hope that Sony would let people around the world watch it instead of it just being on the US store. 




 The CG has not aged well :/ 




 The BMW FW26 aka [Walrus Nose](http://www.carwallpapers.hu/check.php?im=BMW/WilliamsF1_FW26_A/2004_BMW_WilliamsF1_FW26_A_010.jpg) will alwas have a special place in my heart.  




 The ones posted on neogaf were posted by me... 




 Bonus [Bentley in the snow!](http://i.imgur.com/KTbNSkW.jpg) 




 Thanks mate! 




 It's a shame the G27 isn't supported :( 




 Change the shutter speed. If it's /8000 it will make the car appear still. The lower you go the faster it will make the car appear to be moving.  




 Thanks man :) Glad you liked them! 




 Making split screen is actually a pretty difficult process. You essentially have to render what's on screen twice and also do a lot of bug checking. So if split-screen were there in DC it would look pretty bad compared to full screen single player. The manpower required to make split-screen is not worth the effort considering how many people actually use it.  




 I think it's Wild Turkey and coke 




 You need a usb that's formatted as FAT 32. When you take a screenshot on the PS4 you can just transfer it to your usb by navigating to the "captured video/images section", from there you can view all your games and select which images/video you want to copy to your usb :) 









 Really? I thought that was a great scene, showed how disassociated these characters had become when it came to females.  









 Nice you must have gotten a dope as fuck ATAR to be doing undergrad med :) Good luck, my family are all doctors so it's hard work haha 




 Damn MK looks amazing in 60 fps.  




 Still upset about Tron Uprising :( 




 Hadn't heard this tune before this episode but I had a hunch that it was Moby! 




 Ah this video, was there ever any follow up on why he went apeshit at the end? 




 Has a different tone to their previous album but I am really loving this song. 




 What kind of limo do you drive? 




 If it's 60 FPS with fast load times and all DLC, then yes. I never got to experience ME1 and only played ME3 once without any of the DLC. So yes, if the bugs and other gameplay issues are fixed it would defintely be a buy for me.  




 You mean Otm Shank right? 




 When I first saw this film I didn't really enjoy it at all to be honest, but upon the second viewing I actually did end up enjoying it quite a bit. It's not a perfect film but I really love how it's shot and how it portrays the drug game. Plus the music in this movie, well all of Mann's films is amazing.  




 Yeah to be fair Michael Mann does a lot of research when he is making his films, Heat was the first film I had seen where it used proper gun handling techniques and unaltered sound. The guy goes real deep into getting things as realistic as possible.  









 He played Azog in The Hobbit iirc 




 Looks like South Korea will be attempting to do something kind of similar in the future with [8 City](http://travel.cnn.com/korea-8city-tourism-hub-incheon-789461). 




 He confused the shit out of me with the Fight Club blu ray, it loads the menu for some crappy Drew Barrymore rom com and then it slowly starts to artifact and break down into the fight club menu, pretty cool actually.  




 Hugh Jackman in prisoners is when he most looks like Joel.  




 I've only been here a few minutes, what's going on? 









 What? No! 




 Seriously if people are still hesitant about watching this show, don't be. This was one of the best episodes of television I have seen in a long time. Especially given that it's a show on CBS, this is not too common. The first 2 seasons may be a bit hard to get into as it is procedural for the most part but once it gets firmly into it's serial nature it will become one of your favourite shows most likely. Easily a must watch.

 **LOVE**  the [Matrix Reloaded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-URQ4sMzBvA) teaser. I still enjoyed the sequels in their own way compared to the first one and this teaser brought the hype. Not only did you get a glimpse of the second film but at the end the teaser you learn that it will be concluded in a third film to be released the same year.  




 I would say the years that John Carter and Lone Ranger were released might have hurt them that year.  




 Damn they missed out on the daughters retarded running style.  




 Annoying that you have to purchase a new Blu Ray player since I was hoping that my PS4 would be play it. Hopefully the players aren't expensive. 




 Man I miss these guys, personal favourite of mine [Milkman vs Mailman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTBIHXwSLNE) 




 One can hope that FO4 isn't cross-gen. I doubt it would be though since memory has been a very large factor in why the games run like shit sometimes.  




 A more recent pick for me was John Wick, fucking loved the choreography.
