 Conquistador. I know what one is now. 




 the perfect storm. 




 Heh, thanks. Whether this subreddit takes off or not, I just think it's more relevant now that nin has effectively disbanded and that Trent is having just as much success outside of the nineinchnails box. 




 That's why I thought a r/trentreznor subreddit would be more suitable.
 




 and if the planets aligned, he could do an AMA. 




 I think that would be great. I also think that if Trent were a redditor and he saw posts of his new work being submitted in r/nin, it would be a little bit...inappropriate. 




 But the common denominator is Reznor, and I imagine it would generate a lot more traffic than r/nin. 




 I just think that other work - for example, How To Destroy Angels - should be seen in a different light other than NIN. 









 but you get one month freeeeeeeeeeeee. 




 I read that Big Man With a Gun was a song that Trent had his only TDS regrets about, as it was a jab at American gangster rap.  If he did an AMA I'd like to know what other musical regrets he has, and if Big Man With a Gun is still one of them.

 What's the DVD called? I just thought it was part of the viral campaign Trent did for Year Zero. About a minute in I was thinking the sound is really good for somebody filming in the crowd. I nearly didn't watch all of it because I saw that there wasn't enough time in the video for The Wretched to follow The Frail. Glad I did.   









 Upvote for earballs. Though I thought I was the one who invented that word. Sooo bittersweet. 




 We didn't know if they'd tell us if they were going to show her pitures, so everytime they said "and this one is from Lucy..." we'd freak out and run into the lounge room, only to be dissappointed. 




 We sent a couple of pictures (in the same envelope) between 4-6 months ago, and we recieved the response yesterday!

 she was bouncing off the walls all afternoon, carrying the card around with her for hours. When I found out I could help but say "oh, whaaaaat?!" 




 I'm down with Walter White's idea of turning mars into a giant gas station. 




 Snow White! and thanks, these are great. 




 I was so confused as to what direction Trent would take after releasing The Perfect Drug EP.  This song instantly cleared any misconceptions I had on day minus one. 




 How could i ever think it's funny how everything that swore it wouldn't change is different now. 









 I have an imaginary NIN/Trent Reznor EP made up the songs that feature primarily on movie soundtracks (eg Dead Souls, Burn, Driver Down). I always pretend to skip Deep.  




 Sorry, I somehow forgot to put the quote from the movie as he was looking at the picture. "There are dark magics here...and POWER".

 I'm not angry, just disappointed. 




 I'm curious now, who does own the video? 




 While hanging christmas decorations. 




 I thought this is the weird bit:

Wanna start helping and serving Jesus in a practical way? checkout the company of the watch I am wearing in the video! They give 10-25% of all proceeds to non profits and the bands and faces are interchangeable! http://www.cruxwatches.com 




 An interesting way to sell wrist watches. 




 more confused than unhappy, and I tried to clarify this with the magician analogy. even though the slo mo is showing me exactly what is happening, I still have no idea how to do what I just saw. I definitely should have put "this confuses the shit out of me but I'm okay with it" as the title. so I don't do anybody's head in. 




 FILTH! 




 Upvoted for all the cows. 




 not annoyed, but amazed. it's like a magician explaining how a trick is just an illusion, but i'm left walking away saying "no, that's fucking magical".

 Whether it was appropriate or not, I found myself constantly comparing Noomi with Sigourney throughout the movie.

 I understand that he was travelling at over 150mph when he hit the wall be a lot of the force was displaced sideways due to number 36. Why didn't Ken Schrader get injured at all? Is it because he was hit from both the front and side simultaneously that his skull separated(?) from his spine? 




 I don't know a lot about motorsport but with all due respect, [this](http://youtu.be/rXGKys62TXw?t=3m27s) event has me captivated.  After watching numerous videos and reading details about the crash, I still don't understand.

 I was given the same privilege here in Australia in 2005. All I can remember is getting into a debate with the band about where to sign on a vinyl.
