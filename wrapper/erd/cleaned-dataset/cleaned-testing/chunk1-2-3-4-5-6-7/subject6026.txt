 Looks more like a bear nose to me.. http://m.imgur.com/cLoTM2M 




 Where are these images from?
 




 I can relate. I have both versions of the game and doing the custom night challenges on pc are so much easier because of this. On the mobile port golden Freddy just kills you no matter what and I've sorta stopped attempting the rest of the custom night challenges because of this. Hopefully scott fixes this after fnaf 3 comes out. 




 Aww what a cute psychotic killer animatronic...



He actually is really cute in the drawing tho. 




 But why would scott eat something that usually taste really bad? Like really,really bad. 




 Scoot Cuthon
 
























 I was looking around the archive for scottgames.com and noticed that theres been alot of recent saves of the hat.jpg picture which usually means its been changed. It could just be something else of course and im not going to take my time to brighten each and everyone one of them.  




 Also the bad ending has golden freddys head in the background,while the good ending doesn't. 




 Ill delete this post, then. 




 Oh, sorry. I didn't see. 




 We all know that Golden Freddy Appears in the fnaf3 stage01 minigame since you play as him. The file dump for fnaf3 was recently released with the sound files and textures. While looking through the textures i found this guy (its #290 if you want to look for yourself) So, where do you guys think he is. Its transparent so he probably belongs somewhere unless scott removed him. Anyone seen him yet? 




 Yeah but there's sort of a dead body inside of it. You'd think the person buying it would've noticed. 
























 spooky. 




 exactly  




 they're ghost. 




  I believe the toys didn't free them, just brought them together. When purple guy is killed they finally get their revenge and are freed. I also think the original child (The Puppet) was killed in fredbear's which is probably why they were so quick to sell to Fazbear Entertainment. That's just what I think though. We'll probably never know all the answers to the story, we just have to work with what we have. 




 they're ghost... 




 well thats why i put 'might be'. Also i doubt Scott is making FNAF4. The series had its good run and started a good community. Actually, maybe not a good community..whatever. 
























 where the fuck are the shop/security  party hats located 
pls enlist

thank 




 but
I
only have quarters.
 




 Phantom guy yes
 




 beautiful 




 Yeah,you should've posted this to the [Five nights at Fuckboys subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/fnafb) though 




 I was wondering if I needed my serial code on the back of my 3ds to still trade it in. After a long time it came off of course. I remember trying to trade in my old DS lite before and gamestop didn't let me because the serial code was gone. I was also wondering how much money is knocked off if you don't turn it in with the charger.

All these songs are by Muse of Discord and he's been making fnaf songs since around when TLT's first fnaf song came out. They're all great and I suggest ye check them out.  




 [oh hey look a game im totally not make ahahhahaha](http://gamejolt.com/games/other/the-royal-color/55616/)
 




 THe eyes sorta disproves this. I thought about this too though. 




 i liked the memes pal needs more pepe though so i give it like a 10/8 




 T H A N K 
























  Anyone remember when some people thought you were a robot in the first game because you couldn't move? Yeah that made total sense. Also back then I thought Chica was a duck because of the "beak"^totallylookslikeabill
Then I noticed the feet and changed to chicken side (also the name of course) 




 Nah, we all know the biter was phantom fan because thE BITE NEVER HAPPENED, SCOTT CAWTHON DOESN'T EXIST, ITS ALL IN YOUR MIND, IN FNAF 1 YOU'RE A ROBOT, FOXY IS A GOOD GUY   




 ayy lmao 




 Well it's hard to believe they did that on the day they found the suit 




 Hi all! 




 the joke was just there waiting to be made. 
























 no 




 well they all have no teeth (besides the teeth connected to the masks) 




 I didn't even know people thought there were things other than that in the box? 




 no 




 The only problem I have with these is that the small Fredlings are metal and seem to have endoskeletons while plushies are just plushies. The actually definition for a plushy is a soft toy so, yeah. 




 Well it's not impossible some aren't prerecorded. I'm not positive about fnaf 2  but I think fnaf 1 is the only game that directly states they're pre recorded. And you not replying to them doesn't necessarily mean they're not talking to you live since in fnaf 3 the "Phone Dude" calls obviously aren't prerecorded since springtrap isn't present on night 1 of fnaf3.
