 oh my 




 I make them at home! 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream + milk (add as much or as little depending on thickness of milkshake desired *I add 1/2 cup) + about 1/8tsp of peppermint extract.  You can add green food coloring if you'd like. 




 I'm embarassed to admit that I've fallen asleep like this before... 




 Gambling, especially in Vegas.  Slot machines..no desire to play them at all. 




 I don't believe that you should always take something just cause it's free... 




 Sorry to hear about your breakup :( I don't have a lot of advice on this topic since I don't know you or your situation, but I know that you'll be ok.  It probably sucks big time right now... but watch some good movies, eat some good food, and just treat yourself like a king while you ride this whole thing out :D 




 I do some light cleaning around the kitchen while I wait for the microwave to finish heating up my food.  Hot food and less mess in the kitchen... Win! 




 I think she seems really nice, really pretty, has a great body, but she seems like a bit of a fame whore and she really can't sing.  Benjy and Elisa seem perfect for each other.. both very delusional.. LOL 




 Kate winslet in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.   




 I can send some asian candies if you'd like to exchange with me!  I'm in Los Angeles and can get lots of stuff here.  Let me know if you're interested :D 




 Agreed.. plus nothing is more refreshing than iced tea!  I use Stevia in my tea and coffee so I don't have to worry about sugar either.
 




 Agreed :)  But it also depends on how you ask the question... so there's a big difference between " HEY! YOU GOTTA BF?GF????" and " So are you dating anyone currently?".. all about delivery. 




 Avocado + soy sauce + fresh minced garlic... or if you want something sweet... avocado + sugar + milk .. blended with ice.. AMAZING! 




 Bacon anyone? 




 Croc + Eagle = talons/flight/teeth... scarrryyyyy 




 Maybe it's just all the liquid you're drinking that's helping you eat less... 









 Omg... Walls, seat, handle??  Ehhhhh poor janitor....  I'd expect that to happen in the men's restroom, but I've seen some disgusting toilets in the women's restroom.   




 People that use the public restroom and not flush after they do their business.  Ehh the stuff I've seen... Lol 














 :D ! 




 so cute! 




 LOL I've waited years to post this video up... yearsssssss..so yup i'm trying to showoff a little :D 









 SO CUTE! 




 hahah I love it! 




 Darn I just removed the URLS using webmaster tools the other day.  I'm not sure how long it takes for google to change it.  I guess if I don't see a change I'll try the 301.  Thank you SquareWheel. 




 her non-watermarked pictures... :D lol 




 hm... I do see what you mean... 




 That's what I'm thinking as well... but I do wonder how much extra traffic it actually would add if I did... 




 TY for the link with the other watermark threads.  I'll check them out 




 Hey guys, I have a small photoblog where I post photos from travel, things I make, etc..  Recently I've found photos of mine on tumblrs, and other wordpress blogs.  I'm complimented that they'd like it..but should I be watermarking my photos so that i get a little extra traffic?  What are your opinions? 




 Hi guys!  When I launched my photoblog, I had a few extra categories which I deleted within a few days.  Now that it's been almost 2 months since my wordpress blog has been up, google search and  webmasters tools are still showing those deleted categories.  I've submitted my sitemap since the initial category deletion, but it hasn't worked.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you! 




 I posted it as soon as he left... so at the time it did just happen lol. 




 The UPS guy just stared at me, I smiled having no idea his name was Neil...  Then after i signed for the package, he asks me for my dog's name and explains why he was confused.  Then I just went.. "oh.. Hehehehe" 









 Posted this before, but this is how we torture our whippet when he wants to sleep on the couch with us lol http://i.imgur.com/eKZFy.jpg 







































 Hm.. hard to pick just 1... I think that trader joes' dark chocolate peanut butter cups are darn delicious.  Their cookie butter dark chocolate bars are addicting too.  Then there's chocomize where you can add whatever.  I like their premade salty bar.  Kit kats are bomb, and so are almond snickers.  I'm hungry... can you tell? Hahahahah 




 Lol I can totally relate.  My dreams are always vivid so all of the cheating ones still make me mad.  Scumbag brain.. Hahahah 




 I'm not sure if that has anything to do with your child having autism... 




 That happened to my husband a week ago!  He was still upset for a few days after :D  I was kinda flattered that I was so slutty in his dream, since usually it's the other way around in my dreams. Lol 









 Please clean it after with alcohol or something.... pleaseeeeeee 




 It's the same opinion I have for straight parents... If you can afford to raise the child, aren't insane, loving, then go for it! 




 I have no idea how anyone can be against gays.  Look at how cute he is! 




 His left hand looks way bigger than his right? I have no idea...I was never good at those "find what's wrong with this picture" games :( 




 Henry Cavill.  We were at the Immortals premiere and I saw him take photos with female fans in the theater.  So I gathered up my courage, walked over, and asked if he would take a photo with me... Well he turned around, took a look at me, and said " oh they are going to start  the movie" then went back to chatting with the hot girls.  I guess my t-shirt, jeans, and glasses wasn't very cute :( *edited to remove typo 




 Omg I'm freaking out.  I love flight of the conchordsssssss. :D 




 He doesn't seem very impressed... 




 A whole new world! I get very into it when I sing that song. 




 I like the Lindsay Lohan one where she played Hermione after hitting puberty.  Hilarious!   




 You've met some terrible terrible cats.  You're really missing out!  




 I love thissssss!! Lol 




 But cardio is cardio lol.  And i'm sure his heart rate is crazy high. 




 I'm scared.. but.. I didn't like Firefly... :( 




 You would think that with skills like that he'd be super lean. 




 Omg!!!  My fear definitely started after movies started showing the impact from within the car.  The worst for me was from the movie Adaptation.  Did not see that coming.   




 It has to be Ginuwine's Pony http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJoQgixtR78 




 "I love to travel, go to nice restaurants, and shop.  I don't know why people don't spend money to buy nice clothes and accessories. " The girl lived in her in-law's converted garage with her husband. They spent all of their earnings on luxuries.  I wanted to strangle her. 




 Getting into a car accident.  I picture it in my head sometimes while I'm in a car.  Horrible :( 




 Exactly!  It's like a deep deep exfoliation session hahaha 




 He likes to lick my face... and just so happened to get my eye when I took the picture. 









 Aww I want to kiss those cheeks!!!  




 Thank you so much for your help.  Sucuri definitely found malware on my blog but when I went into my posts, I couldn't find any lines of text that seemed out of place.  I emailed my hosting to see if they could help but no reply yet. 




 Beautiful photograph!  We don't have an attatched garage so our dog stands outside of the restroom when I go in to use it ....  




 aw he loves it!  My whippet hates bananas.. lol 




 Hi guys, today is the 2nd time my wordpress blog has been redirecting to a porn website when you read it on a mobile device.  I've changed my admin password, I always update my plugins and wordpress versions.. and this still happened to me.  What else can I do?  Thank you so much!  Thank you for your help. 




 No problem!  Here's a list of bonfires in southern california http://www.beachcalifornia.com/beach-bonfires-california.html .  I love doing beach days though it might get crowded in July.  No bonfires but Venice Beach is always fun.  Other fun stuff would be hiking to the Griffith Observatory http://www.yelp.com/biz/griffith-observatory-hike-los-angeles or http://www.yelp.com/biz/runyon-canyon-park-los-angeles-2 if you want to catch some celebrities.  Tons of girly stuff to do here in LA.  I hope you gals have a great time :D 




 TV Anchors that just lose it or SNL cast members/guests that break character. 




 Hi!  Not sure what your exact budget is, but I would go to travelzoo or groupon and check out some of the deals they have for hotel or group activites.  Temecula (lots of wine tastings here) is only 90 minutes from LA so you can still party at a club on a day and checkout some orchards on another.  Another lower cost option would be hanging out at the beach for the day for a picnic/bbq and stay for a bonfire at night.  Cheap and fun!  Hope that helps :D 




 I really love Dog Haus!  It's affordable, delicious, and I love the relaxed vibe.  My favorite location is their Pasadena Biergarten one :D 




 Lol I am not a girl with a big butt but I remember being surprised at how much bounce I was getting.  The even more embarassing part was that there were people in front of me and I felt like a bowling ball.  Kind of like that chubby black kid in Hook. 




 Was touring a newly built 15 million dollar home while wearing a pair of booties over my shoes on a newly installed/waxed wooden spiral staircase.  My life flashed before my eyes as I started to bounce down the steps on my butt.  First thing I said when I stood up was "omg did I break the stairs?".  I did not want to pay to fix a staircase that was put into a home that expensive lol. 




 You were 2??? Ehhh I'm so old.. Lol 




 Watching Interview with a Vampire while lying on the floor leaning against the ottoman... while my dog is on the couch all tucked in with a blanket. 




 End of the Road = Junior High.  Basically anything Boyz II Men Makes me feel young again... 




 Mexican pizza from Taco Bell.  The only time it actually tastes delicious. 
























 Thank you guys so much for your help!  It worked :D

But now I've noticed I have another problem, and that is when I open my blog on my Ipad, the menu drops down fine, and I can click on colorado and nevada, but california doesn't seem to work.  I click and click.. but it doesn't take me anywhere.  helpp :D

edited to add the new problem 




 Hi!  I have a photoblog http://www.test_subject6067.com and I just added the travel-at a glance page on the nav bar.  I made it a parent page to two other pages (California, Nevada), and I would like it to just drop down instead of always taking you to the parent page.  I'm not sure if I'm making any sense lol but any help would be appreciated.  Thank you! 




 If you make cold process soap, you could puree them without the seeds/stem and make pear soap!  I do that with fruit all the time.  Or maybe put the puree on your face like a fresh fruit face mask. 




 Yup I'm a girl :D  Best I can do is use my experience with shaving my legs.  Even then, I'm not using a brush so I have no idea the kind of luxurious foam everyone talks about when it comes to shaving your face.  




 I agree, most of the shaving soaps people seem to recommend are all tallow based.  I have met lots of people that were allergic to lanolin, so perhaps offering some with and some without would be the best choice.  ty! 




 I love buying handcrafted soaps as well.  I just call it "product research" ahahahah.   




 thank you for the tip on the puck being too small.  I had never considered that being an issue.  TY! 




 Scent right now isn't what I'm thinking about.  Just creating a great base is #1 :D
 




 Tallow definitely turns many people off, but I have noticed that popular shaving soaps all have it.  There are vegetable oils that give vegan soaps a similar lather so I'll definitely be testing out lots of recipes.  I agree samples is king! lol 




 I will definitely try using a brush and a razor to shave my legs to test out the quality of the lather.  And I definitely agree with you on the adding bentonite clay and calling it shaving soap phenomenon .  All it seems to do is add a little slip.  Definitely not the great lather I've seen on many youtube videos demonstrating shaving soap.  Thank you for the advise :D  




 Thank you so much!  Many of the oils used to make a foamy, bubbly soap can be drying.  That's why it's a balancing act.  I really appreciate the help :D 




 Hi illsolvethat!  Thank you for helping me out.  I love using grassfed tallow!  Soaps made with tallow gets lots of great foam.  I was wondering, is moisturizing an important aspect to a shaving soap?   




 Hi everyone!  I've been a soap maker for 10 years and recently decided to start selling.  I would love to make some great shaving soaps to add to my line.  Since I don't have a beard, I'm not really sure what makes a great shaving puck.  There are lots of glycerin soaps that give extra lather, but do you guys think that they perform well enough? Do you guys have a preference when it comes to an all veggie soap or one made with tallow or lard?  Do you like a soap puck that comes in a container already or prefer a puck by itself?  Thank you guys so much!   




 90% of the time I use self checkout, a cashier still has to come over to punch in codes or something...  




 Hi everyone!  I've been keeping a worm factory worm bin on my balcony for the last 3-4 years very successfully.  I've always seen a couple of maggots in my bin, but not a lot.  I just pick them out and toss them.  Suddenly in the last 2 months there's been more but today I just checked and I couldn't find any worms in the top 2 bins!  Everything I see moving are small maggots!  Now.. I'm not sure exactly what I should do.  If I stop feeding them I'm afraid that my worms will starve (I think they are already) but there seems to be too many for me to pick out.  Any help would be appreciated :D 




 Progressive insurance.  Ehhh Flo...  




 Ripping the warning tag off stuff...freaked me outttt 




 Omg yes! I like soy sauce + finely minced garlic on mine.  Delicious! 




 Hi guys! I had a quick question regarding batting.  I'm really interested in starting to quilt but wasn't sure where I should buy batting that has the best prices.  I've looked at Joann's, Walmart, Michaels.. but wasn't sure if there were other options.  Any help would be appreciated :D 




 We reuse all of our plastic bags from grocery stores as trash bags or as doggy poop bags.  Now.... we are just going to have to buy more plastic bags.  Danggg 




 YES!  And I loved how the upstairs bedrooms all opened to the outside balcony and not an indoor hallway.  The outdoor shower was pretty fantastic too.   




 I shot there a few times.  It's a beautiful property.  At the time he was building a movie room and a party room... I wonder if those are finished.   




 Yes this please!!!  




 Your brother is freaken hilarious on Dexter!  Yay for a funny Asian guy on a hit show :D  




 OMG please please fire him.  I can not stand Benjy anymore.  I don't know if it's cause he's getting older?  If Elisa is driving him crazy, but Benjy is just becoming more delusional and less funny rapidly. 




 I want to like her...but sometimes she is really irritating on the show.  She has no clue that she comes off as being really annoying and that makes me feel kind of bad for her.  The worst was when she kept apologizing to Benjy by saying " I'm sorry you were offended " EHH!!!  




 Yeah definitely a bigger cab with our luggage and carry ons. 




 We will be on the east coast so there will be 2 full sized luggages and 5 carry ons along with purses, etc.  I figure pulling everything during rush hour can't be fun.  It does seem like getting a larger cab and splitting it is cheaper than renting a shuttle for $20 a head.   




 Yes I agree, I'm almost 100% sure we'll just take a bus to AC.  AC to DC... we might just rent a car and split it.  Now I"m just trying to figure out the toll roads situation.  I don't even have an idea of about how much it will cost since it looks like we'll be hitting up 3-4 toll stops. 




 Well there's definitely no deadline to DC.  I've just looked from google maps and it seems like we'd have to transfer a few times.  The idea of us dragging our luggage around seems like it may turn into a lot of work... hahahaha 




 The Greyhound seems to only take 2 hours 30 minutes so it's not too bad, but it's 5 hours to get to DC from Atlantic City since it goes through Philadelphia.  I will definitely check Ri Ra!  I'm not sure if we'll be leaving the boardwalk area but thanks for the tips :) 




 I did see that Amtrack is SUPER EXPENSIVE.  I would LOVE to take the train but wow.. the prices.  I do think that renting a car would work.  I used google maps and saw that there are a few toll roads we would hit if we were to drive to DC.  Is there a website I could check how much the tolls would cost? 




 I think we'll Greyhound it to Atlantic City.  The free slot play is pretty tempting.. lol.  As for getting to DC... I saw that the bus takes 5 hours, but driving would only take 3.... so many things to consider.  




 The only shuttles I found cost $20 per person. 




 Hello East Coasters! 5 of us will be in NYC till Friday and wanted to check out Atlantic City before we leave.  I wanted to know if you guys had any tips on how to get there from Times Square.  I saw that there are a few bus options and was thinking about trying Greyhound's Lucky Streak.  Is that a good choice?  

After a fun Friday in Atlantic city, we will have to travel to DC on Saturday and needed a recommendation on how to get there.  Are there bus options?  Should we subway it?  Rent a car? Any tips would be appreciated! Thank you ahead of time :D 




 lefferts = awesome.  Thank you for your tip :D 




 Thank you so much!  $58 + tip is not bad... and would definitely be easier than jumping on subways with all our luggage.  I'm afraid we'll get ripped off cause they can tell we're out of towners lol 




 Hi guys! 5 of us are traveling to NYC this coming Monday and wanted to know what is the best way to get from JFK airport to our hotel in Times Square.  We will have luggage and there's 5 of us so I figured getting regular cab would be impossible.  I would love any tips you guys can offer.  Thank you! 




 You're photogenic! I must be really ugly in person :( 




 Maybe you can get a detachable shower head and hold it on your head while tilting your head backwards.  Less water dripping down your face! 




 Immigration policy? 
























 http://youtu.be/5xi4O1yi6b0 




 Understanding sarcasm.  I'm not sarcastic so I'm never sure if I'm on the receiving end of it.  Unless it's blatantly obvious.  Sarcasm through text messages are the worst. 




 Elaine? 




 Dateline! 




 I use a bit of twitter to get the word out.  My little blog also has lots of photos so sometimes the restaurants or stores use them on their Facebook pages.  I get a good boost in traffic when that has happened.

Edited for spelling 




 This!  The freedom of rolling around in your undies on cool sheets.   




 This will be my first Secret Santa gift exchange!  I'm thinking about spoiling my giftee with something homemade.  Perhaps some handmade candles + soaps :D  









 I think that he's wearing a woman's shirt.  The moobs don't help, but the shirt doesn't look like it's cut for a guy. 




 Awwww I don't know her and I already love her :D Yay for Alice!! 




 That poor assistant had to keep on smiling... how uncomfortable. 




 Maybe you could rub some sugar+olive oil+honey on your lips and let it soak in.  Then after rinsing off with warm water you could use a natural lip balm (non medicated, just simple oil+beeswax type) and try to stop licking your lips.  I know that when I get wind chapped lips I tend to lick it a lot ... which makes it worst. 









 Hot stinky breath, greasy hair, and musky clothes, this is how I imagine what Russell Brand smells like from watching that gif. 




 That was such a strange way of holding a cup with that much liquid.  It made the video more intense cause I kept thinking it would spill over.  




 I'm not really sure.. maybe a total of 20-30 minutes?  As soon as we got off the Bart, walked up the stairs, and we saw a line that was already formed outside on the corner.  Someone was there at a table selling round trip tickets.  The shuttle arrived after 10 minutes of waiting and the ride was 15-20 minutes.  Make sure you only use clear bags or gallon ziplocks.  We totally forgot about it, but good thing my purse was pretty small :D  Have a great time if you decide to go! 




 And we are back!  We jumped on the south Hayward Bart, transferred at bay fair, got off at balboa, jumped on the 75x then arrived at candlestick!  Thank you all for helping :)   




 I saw them on Yelp!! I'm tempted to go get some pumpkin beer lol :D 




 Just downloaded! Thank you :) 




 You are amazing!  Thank you so much for your help :D 




 Thank you so much for your help!  We tried asking the hotel staff and they had no clue.  After we get off the bart at Balboa Park, will the 75x bus be nearby?  




 Hi guys!  We are here for a 49ers game tomorrow and staying in Hayward.  I would love some help on figuring out how to get there.  We want to take the Bart but not sure which exit to get off.  I've also read that it's not really walkable from the Bart station to candlestick.  Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you. 




 This is exactly what I was thinking... 

 If not the budget, then perhaps buying different items or presenting the food in a better way...  




  I just think that this picture looks a little sad for a big company like sirius to tweet out.  Unless that was part of the joke...  




 No, the sternshow Instagram account posted it.  The spread is kind of sad :( I think I could buy stuff at Costco that would look better than this. 




 Nice strong forearms on a guy. 




 When I make my own Almond milk, I like to blend a date into it.  Sweetens it and adds a great flavor.  But since you're on Keto, you could add a few drops of flavored Capella or flavored stevia. 




 I find that most people like to talk about their favorite movies or television shows.  You can open with " hey have you watched ________ yet?" then fill in the blank with the last movie you watched. Then BAM you're talkin it up! 




 Wow a Barbie face with a GI Joe body... 




 I think the whole styling + look she's giving makes her look like a cast member of "Real Housewives of Orange County."  She looks younger and fresher when she smiles.  She looks older, amateurish, and like she is trying too hard in this pic :( 




 What year is this? 1994? Thumbs down on Barbados.  However, I actually liked Online Sweetheart :D 




 I could not stop laughing!!  My favorite line was " my body is rejecting this." 




 I LOLed at the Venus fly trap comment.. ahahahah.  I killed 20 BSF adults yesterday and there hasn't been anymore today, so hopefully it's over.  I was thinking maybe they're trying to come inside since the AC is on and it's 100 degrees outside.  I haven't looked in the bin in 2 weeks cause I've been scared.  Later on today I'm planning on going outside with the vacuum hose and suck up any BSF adults I see in the bin.  Wish me luck.  eeeek 




 So I've been trying to starve my bin a bit and today I've started to see Black Soldier Fly adults inside my house!  ACK!  Is there a reason why they would want to come into the house?  We don't have any rotting food, our back door hasn't been opened, but I still see them gathering around the window closest to the door.  Could they be crawling in from around the door? Why are they in the house? AHHh help please lol.   




 You and your "huge-ass roommate" really are great people :D  Makes me proud that you live in Los Angeles! 




 I have a scentsy one that I love and a walmart one for our restroom.  I've noticed that walmart does have a great selection and new ones all the time. 




 Hm.. I've ordered from Candles by Victoria, Front Porch, and Grumpy Girls. I think there are more but those are all I can remember off the top of my head. Since I make candles, I just scoop out leftover wax from testing and use it in my tart warmer.   




 I haven't..but their melters seem to all come in Blue.. strange... ahahaah 




  I LOVE your blog.  There I said it :D That Pesto recipe looks delicious. 




 That's why I've left it that way for this long.  The thing that does bother me is it runs on with my posts titles.  For example, if a title of a page is "my first post" it looks like " My first posttest_subject6067.com" . Should I just leave a space after my titles or add a space in front of sitename .  I don't even know if that would work!  




 Was looking at my titles and it seems like the default has sitename in it.  Do I really need it for better Seo?  Thank you! 
























 I am a little worried about the balance = weight variation.  I guess I could go on and off of it a few times to get an average? 




 Very cool, thank you for your input :)  My old scale showed body fat % but I like how aria shows lean body mass.  I'm lazy about it too.  Although I log my weight daily, I don't log all the other numbers.   




 Thank you for your reply!  I've never seen trendweight.com and was wondering what the difference was between their website and fitbit's weight graph. 




 Ms. Betsy looks like she could be our boy Neo's sister!! http://instagram.com/ohhallo

*edited cause of missing words lol 




 Lol now you know so much about me! Hahahha 




 I love eating kale in salads, but somehow when it's dehydrated into chips I get sick. 




 I waited and waited... ehhhh... you got me OP... lol 




 Hey guys!  I've been using FitBit since launch and love it.  I've been looking at getting FitBit's Aria but wanted to know how you guys liked it.  How accurate do you think the scale is in general?  I had a scale once that would change the weight every time I got off and back on... ehh.. lol.   How accurate does it measure the body fat % + lean mass%?  Any help would be appreciated :D 




 Kale chips are so delicious! But.. I find that I get digestive problems if I eat too many. Maybe it's the fiber but mannnn dangerouss.. lol 




 I'm not sure if you're going to see this.. but Jon Congdon was my 7th grade homeroom teacher.. LOL.  Please tell him I said hi! :D 




 The one where the Japanese Hooker shit in the tub and ate it.  It wasn't shown on camera but somehow it still made me gag.   




 I was just starting to fall asleep and then I see your comment and start to lol.  Freaked the dog out... Hahahhah 




 I smell nothing.  Is this just a guy thing? Lol 




 Cooking and baking.  I love to try new dishes at restaurants then try to make them at home.  It's like cracking a secret code lol. 




 Yup yup yup! 




 Ty Shauna!  He's a whippet! 









 My whippet never does this!  I always see photos of whippets on their backs but mine seems to prefer the " nose to the butthole " position. ... Hahahaha 




 Awww she looks so sweet. 




 My husband and I go to Vineland drive in and Mission Tiki all the time.  Check them out!  Mission Tiki's quality seems better but it's a bit of a drive. 




 Yes!  I'll order almost anything on the menu if it had aioli I'm it.  Dipping fries in it is like heavennnnn 




 Aioli!   




 I love this idea and the look of it.  My concern is that the swinging opening cover won't be completely spill proof and must be kept upright.  I would love to be able to put it into my bag like a thermos. 




 Thank you so much!  Yeah Mango (cat) is Neo's big brother.   




 Tell me about it.  I gave him 10-15 treats and then had to move him off so that I could close the treat bag lol 




 Thank you!  This was actually part 2 of the gifts I received from my SS.  I posted everything here. http://redditgifts.com/gallery/gift/sharknado-house-pic-heavy/ 









 It looks like it's quite the workout. 




 Um... Why is he fisting the male elephant?  I'm so confused...  Is he stimulating the elephant's prostate? 




 o.O 




 No matter what you do the rest of your life, you'll always be trash.  Go Lois 




 Awww look at that face :) 




 Because usually, they aren't kept clean.  I do think that for most people, long nails = feminine.  For me.. it's the cleanliness factor.  Applies to both men and women. 




 " Santa " wrote me a note with our post-it.  Then I noticed that his handwriting looked like my Dad's.  7 year old me did some interrogating and came to the conclusion that Santa was fake! 




 Awww her paws....too cute 




 A strong, reliable, and clean toilet.  The horrors you see when you travel.  Eek edited for bad grammar 




 The little mermaid!  Just watched it again recently and the ending still made me cry. 




 Having someone enjoy something I've made or food I've cooked.  Amazing feeling :) 




 I'm a good listener and can make people feel comfortable around me very quickly.   




 Deep breathing.  I start to take longer and slower breaths.  Dark curtains help a lot too. 




 Try using Tend Skin after you shave.  Also make sure you gently exfoliate the area as the hair grows out.  If you have really curly pubes it might be harder to get rid of bumps :( Try using Magic shave on it instead of a razor!  The silver sensitive can works quite well. 
























 Exfoliation + moisturizing my upper arms have helped.  I make solid scrub bars to use but I'm sure a good loofah would work.  Some people say dry brushing helps too. 




 You're crazy!  This sounds delicious :D 




 Beautiful, but I can't imagine having to clean the little crevices if something spills.  So much work to maintain.. lol
 




 I like #1 the best :D 




 Talisman!  The longest session we've ever played was 8 hours straight.  Damn you hag!! 




 I love playing this on my iPhone and iPad!  Most expensive app I've ever purchased ($10) but so worth it :D 




 Just watched Oculus.  Gotta take out the mirrors out of our house.   




 Sixth Sense and the first Insidious were both really scary to me, but Thailand's Shutter was freakkyyyy.  Actually Hong Kong's The Eye 2 was frightening.  That hospital elevator scene still haunts me.  




 Love it! Now you're like an anime character :D

 A half up pompadour style with medium barrel curls?  




 I honestly have never heard of that term lol.  The things I learn while reading reddit posts hahahah. 




 I'm just going to ask, what's a bussy? 




 I love your hair!  You look beautiful :D 




 Everything else sounded ok until the peanut butter.  Why the peanut butter?? whyyyyy?   




 Our whippet only grabs things when they've already hit the floor :(  lol 




 Lucy thinks that she's a cat! 




 For me it's microwaved flax seed bread, stevia, obsessed with all the true lemon products, and cauliflower rice :D 




 Omg this is my blog!  Glad you love the bread too.  I eat it all the time and it makes me feel like I'm having real bread.  Ty for checking it out :D 




 I've actually worked as a photographer/retoucher for many years and trust me...lots and lots of retouching goes into every photo.  Lots :/ 




 I've never been more entertained and grossed out by a single comment.  Congratulations :D 




 Oh my that "soup" has such translucent quality to it... *throws up 




 That looks pretty good!  Great job. 




 I don't use any sauce.  Maybe that's the key! 




 I do that all of the time!  Cringeeeeee.... 




 Freshly sliced cucumbers and watermelon.  It's even better if they're nice and cold. 




 I have a pretty sensitive stomach, but Taco Bell never makes me sick...  




 I felt like my arteries were getting clogged by looking at the photos.   




 omg.. lol I'm so silly.  I did have a duplicate category and tag :D  TY so much guys! 




 Hi guys, I have a category slug that has a -2 but there isn't another category with a duplicate name.  Can anyone tell me how to change it?  Thank you! 




 I really like mine.  I've had it for over a month now.  No rash so far!  I think I'm going to keep mine but I am worried about the recall window as well... 




 Hi guys!  I'm looking to purchase one of those tv programming boxes for my parents so they could watch more chinese shows.  I've looked at Suntv, TvPad 2 and 3, and wasn't sure which ones you guys would recommend.  I don't live with them but they do have cable internet so I figured one of these boxes would be great.  Any input would be appreciated :D   




 Lol! 




 the " woe is me look "  




 My dog and cat would both just die of happiness :D 




 Reddit is really starting to make me think that incest is really common... o_O 




 It seems like Howard always gets bummed out about Artie since the show was sort of blamed for his suicide attempt.  I agree that the crowd would have loved it.  I just think that Artie showing up or making a video would end up being more about Artie and overshadow the other stuff that ended up happening.   




 He hasn't been back on the show since the suicide attempt, so I think a more serious setting would have been more appropriate.  I'm sure he sent his birthday wishes to Howard privately. 




 I'm glad that he wasn't at the show.  IMO it would have made the vibe of the event slightly uncomfortable. 




 Thank you for the link to your review.  I will check it out :D
 




 I have a tanita scale too that I really liked.  But it recently died... :( 
























 We'll just sit here and watch the other people and see what they do... 




 soooo muchhhh sodiummmmm  




 Tons of really amazing Asian food places within walking distance.  Downside... lots of Asian drivers :(.  FYI I'm Asian and even I know that driving around here is more defensive than anything else lol. 




 Currently using MyFitnessPal but this app looks more sleek.  I'm really excited to try this out! 




 Those eyes, the floppy ears, the paws... can't handle the cuteness overloaddddddd 




 Oh my... the font choices... 




 Ehhhh that's terrible.  Poop awayyyy!!! 




 I like how your first reaction was to shit on their car... lol 




 Great photo!  Thanks for sharing it :) 




 Throw on a piece of pineapple and call it a Hawaiian taco! 




 I've stopped there a few times and never noticed the baklava milkshakeeeee!  That sounds delicious! 




 Soooo deliciousssss.  Their matzo ball soup is amazing as well. 




 Drove from Miami to Key West and it seemed like 1/2 the houses had these.  Love them :) 




 This movie made me so sad and angry at the same timeeeeee!!! The rage, the tears!! 




 I think it's cause he is so confident around women that it takes them by surprise.  He also does have a nice voice and I bet he knows how to sweet talk.  I don't think he's ugly, but he definitely gets hotter women than you'd expect. 




 :( a day of suffering and cringe moments have given you an awesome story to tell.  If you can survive that, you can survive anything :D  




 Lol lol I wasn't upset at her when she wore the same color.  I felt more bad  for her cause people noticed.  It also didn't help that it was the first time I'd seen her.... so I didn't know who this extra bridesmaid was lol.  I can't imagine how badly you must had felt.  Good thing something always goes wrong at weddings so hopefully your crime wasn't the worst.   




 Lol that happened to me at my wedding.  My husband's friend brought his girlfriend (without telling us) and she showed up in a dress that was the same color as my bridesmaids.  She sort of hid from us the whole day lol.   




 agreed.. this really was a very sad sad photo... lol 




 Loved the video! It was food porn at it's finest.  Great choice in music as well.  I was hungry and relaxed both at the same time...hahahah 




 I never realized that her eyes and nose reminded me so much of Kristen Bell!   




 I will try this recipe this weekend! 




 Hi guys!  I love chewy chocolate chip cookies but I can't seem to find the perfect recipe.  I've tried Alton Brown's the chewy, the NY Times recipe, and a few others.  I love chewy cookies that are almost like a macaron. Any help would be appreciated! 




 When I'm in an elevator at night I sometimes still think about it.  Sooo freaken scaryyyy 




 I know the whole thing sounds so strange, but I'm definitely not drinking or have anxiety about flying.  The worst thing flight I've had was from LA to Denver.  Then it took 5 days before I felt better :(. I'm not sure about dehydration, but maybe I should drink more water the day before flying. This whole thing is just such a mystery and I haven't met anyone else that have had this problem. 




 I've never seen a doctor for this because I've always assumed that altitude sickness pills were only prescribed to patience going to places with high altitude and not just for plane flights. I really want to travel more but being sick on the plane is seriously no fun :( 




 I'm actually not afraid of flying and even though I dry heave, I'm not actually nauseous.  I've tried to suck on ginger candies but the dry heaving doesn't go away.  I've tried taking Bonine but it didn't help either.  One time I took NyQuil which helped me fall asleep, but after 2 hours I woke up with the same symptoms plus body aches :( 




 I've gotten altitude sickness the last 4 times I've flown.  The first 30 minutes I'm completely fine.  Then after about an hour I find myself dry heaving and breathing fast the rest of the flight.  I don't know what to do.  Any tips would be greatly appreciated :D  Thank you. 




 The crust on the cheese steak reminds me of a fig newton...  




 I can just imagine a bunch of redditors trekking through Koreatown in search of the mountains lol :D 




 I like Popeyes better... hahahaha 




 Yeah I can imagine! With multiple layers, it might end up being more like a lash tint.  




 I love to use Mango Butter and Shea Butter in all of my soap recipes.  The combination of the 2 give a great feel to the bar itself as well as the lather :D 




 I make soap and sell soap, but I still love trying out other people's products :).  I love looking at the ingredients label so anything with fun or exotic butters always catches my eye.  I love an all olive oil soap but I know that it's going to be a little slimy in the shower and have little lather.  I don't personally care if it's colored, but I do LOVE a good exfoliation soap for my body.  For my face I like an unscented or very lightly scented with essential oils, uncolored, bar of soap made with lots of olive oil. 




 Thank you so much for your detailed review!! It seems to do a great job lengthening.  I wonder if it would be even thicker if you applied more coats.  Then again it may never come off hahahah.  Thank you again! 









 Your blog is great!  That carrot cake looks delicious :) 









 Hey guys!  My blog posts are mainly travel photos but I also have a few recipes and photos of my handmade soap.  Take a look at my blog and let me know if anyone wants to do a guest blog with me :D http://www.test_subject6067.com  




 Wow California??  Super jealous!  Seems like every place I've looked here in Southern California have been dry deserts :( 




 Looks delicious!!
