 Thanks, that was really clear and easily understood. The video also helped a lot. 









 I met him as well. I was really young, 5 or 6 maybe and he was shooting a movie near where I lived so my dad brought me over there and told me  "That's the Genii from Aladdin!!". I, being a 5 year old, immediately ran over to meet him. As I was running over, a van with some sort of film equipment was coming by and was going to hit me. Robin yelled at the same time as my dad for me to stop. Robin Williams saved my life, then afterward, we had a little conversation about watching for cars. Meanwhile, my stupid older brother sat in the car and listened to music.

 Thanks for all the help guys!! 





























 This pretty much sums up my entire life. At least I have reddit, where I know everyone hates everyone! 





























 If over time waves lose energy and speed, does that mean that there are separate sections for waves of separate wavelengths? I'm thinking this because if if an X-ray were to lose energy over time and become a radio wave,  wouldn't it be moving at the same rate as all other radio waves created near the same time? Then over time, wouldn't there be a huge difference in the number of radio waves and all other wavelengths? 




 I don't mean to be mean

but I'll make you my queen

if you suck on my peen

I keep it very clean

and it's really quite lean

I'm sorry it's green

I got a bad gene

but to counter the green, it has a nice sheen

I'll be honest, I'll become quite keen

if only you only

just suck on my peen
 


































 This is too accurate.. 




 With all the buzz about the issues with Unity, the frame rate issues in particular, I'd expect Ubi to say something about it. Have they said anything about upcoming patches or anything? 
























 Kyle or Chad. I've never met anyone named Kyle or Chad who wasn't a douchebag 




 I think that this happened to show that despite the attributes I described he's still a human, and humans fuck up.  




 I actually respect Frank a great deal. He does what the fuck he wants and gets what he wants despite all obstacles. This doesn't change the fact that he's an awful human being though. I think that one thing the show does really well is showing that despite him being an awful person we all want to be like Frank, at least a little bit. Everyone wants to be strong willed, intelligent, cunning, clever and ambitious. But everyone also wants to be a good person, unlike Frank. Frank doesn't give a fuck. 
























 Yeah, it would serve drinks. I thought about getting a job at a club, but I life in a rural area so there aren't any around, which is one reason why I had the idea.  




 Brand new to this sub, so I have super limited knowledge. I'm an 18 year-old who is considering starting a dance club in my local urban area which allows 18+ patrons. I'm going to take a class on entrepreneurship next semester, but I was curious if you guys had any advice on how to get this all started. I was thinking market research to see if it was even worth pursuing? 




 No follow-ups, and each of them is thinking only in terms of their designated title within the group (ie, the physicist is only thinking in terms of physics).
