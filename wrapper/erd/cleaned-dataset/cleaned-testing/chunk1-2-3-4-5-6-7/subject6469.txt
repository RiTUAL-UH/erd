 Oh,thanks, I fixed it. 


































 Hi,all. I have no money,no jobs. So I made web app which named Trick Star thanks to Flask.

Check it out.http://trickstar.info/

This web service is made to found videos in youtube's videos for programmer by Github's star count.

If you are want to be innovator of this service, I want you to upload good videos.

This service is still beta, so if you have any feedback or idea , please sent email to  me (test_subject6469@gmail.com) or leave comment,please. 




 It's great!

 




 I fixed code to  copy  it easily. 
























 I made ChainDrive App(https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chain-drive/id789649816?ls=1 mt=8)  which is based on Don't break the chain method by Jerry Seinfelds (You can see the source at http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret)

It's change your task to habit by do it everyday.

Don't break the chain! 




 Hey! No, It just take care of developer's star count. 

 I'll fix my spell miss.

Although it is lack of document,I'll push this code to Github in the few days.

When I done it , I'll post it here.




 




 Thanks for your response! 

Currently, I have no plan about it because I have to get some money.

But If this service is dying, I'll make it open source .

 





























 Ok.I'll try to solve this problem.
