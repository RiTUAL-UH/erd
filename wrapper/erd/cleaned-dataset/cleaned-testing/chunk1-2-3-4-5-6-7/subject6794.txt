 Okay, look, if you are suffering from depression and you used to cut I feel for you. Depression sucks, I know it. But there is absolutely no reason for you to bash other people who are suffering by calling them slurs used against women and queer people. That is not acceptable behavior. I don't care if you don't like other people "whining" about their problems, but you have issues and hate speech is not going to help you out any. 




 A lot of bisexual people I know don't like men and women completely equally or in the same way. Some of them are bisexual but only homoromantic or heteroromantic (emotionally attracted to those of the same sex/gender or opposite sex/gender). This is not uncommon at all, and totally normal and okay.

As to whether or not you should come out, that's up to you. Everybody has to make their own decision about whether or not they want to come out and who they should come out to. If you're afraid of coming out because people won't believe you or you don't think your identity is "legitimate" don't worry about that. But if you have reservations for other reasons, I can't really help you there. Just do what you think will work best for your.

As far as counselors and therapists, you should do some research online and see if you can find any in your local area that are LGBTQ-friendly. Not all therapists have the best views, but the ones who are friendly usually advertise it. You could also potentially ask around if you know anyone else that sees a good one - word of mouth is usually a pretty good indicator. Whenever you talk to them about it, just talk. They're there to listen - it's their job.

Hopefully all goes well, I wish you all the best! 




 Well, it would be somewhat concerning for me. If you don't have any friends, that's somewhat of a red flag. Are you too busy for friendships? If so, how do I know you'll have time for a romantic relationship? Or perhaps your personality isn't that great, so people don't really want to be your friend. Or maybe you just don't like people, in which case I would wonder what sorts of things we can do together that don't involve lots of other people. Or maybe you just moved into town and haven't met a lot of people yet.

If we were in a relationship, I would expect you to hang out with my friends on occasion. If you don't like people, that would be a problem for you, and if people don't like you, that would be a problem for everyone else. It could potentially put a lot of strain on our relationship.

That said, I'm sure I could potentially make it work with someone in this sort of situation. However, it would be a cause for concern. This sort of thing really depends on why it is exactly that you don't have any other friends. But keeping up with conversation/not being clingy definitely helps. 




 Wow! You're looking great! Keep being fabulous :D 




 I got a very similar feeling, although I don't smoke and it would be tequila instead of scotch. 




 One of the more common conditions was actually syphilis. In the late 18th century syphilis patients made up about 20% of those in asylums. By 1818, the Royal Asylum for the Insane at Charenton recorded that up to one third of their male patients had GPI, or general paresis of the insane - the underlying cause of which was syphilis. The numbers of syphilitic patients increased greatly throughout Europe in the last few decades of the 19th century. (Source: Syphilis, sex and psychiatry, 
17891925: Part 1 by Robert M Kaplan)

Symptoms included and abnormal gait, blindness, confusion, dementia, depression, headache, incontinence, inability to walk, irritability, numbness in the extremities, poor concentration, seizures, stiff neck, tremors, visual disturbances, and weakness, according to the [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/neurosyphilis/). Of course, this disease was no longer an issue after the advent of penicillin during WWII, as syphilis is a bacterial disease and antibiotics made it easily treatable, so it rarely gets to the later stages that doctors used to see in psychiatric patients.

I can't tell you that much about other conditions as (unfortunately) they don't teach a lot of the history of psychiatry whenever you're an undergrad, but what I do know I mostly remember from reading things here or there in my spare time, so I'm not really comfortable discussing other stuff I don't know as much about. 




 I was doing okay until the person draining the abscess started digging their finger around in it. That's when I noped out. 




 That sounds like a really awesome project. I hope they get all the funding they need. :D 




 I'm so glad that I don't have any more school obligations until next semester. I turned in my last paper today.

I'm glad that I live with two incredibly wonderful people who have been really supportive of me throughout this very hectic year.

I'm also thankful that my mom, who divorced my abusive stepdad a few years back, just recently got married again to a really great guy and my sister now has another awesome parent she can look up to as she gets older.

Finally, I'm really thankful that I decided to join a group therapy session for LGBTQ people, everyone in my group was really great and they all made me feel a lot more confident of myself and forgiving of my flaws. They were super inspiring people and I will miss all of them. 




 Well when I came out to my dad I didn't get the best response. To most of the other people I know I merely posted a link to the Huff Post series on asexuality with the comment that anyone who was interested could read more about my identity. It did get a few responses, mostly from friends who were curious, and also one friend who told me that she was ace too! That was kind of neat.

I think that this approach certainly helped. Have information ready. Coming out as gay is different, because at least when you tell someone "I'm gay" they know what that means - you like people of the same sex/gender. But most people have never even heard of asexuality, while even those that have don't usually understand it that well. Plus, if you come prepared with research or articles or FAQs or whatever it shows that you've really put thought into this and your identity isn't just low self-esteem or a phase you'll get over or something equally stupid. Asexuality is a thing that exists, and it is a definitely a part of who you are.

Hope that helps, and good luck! 




 That he was the weird guy with the long hair and all the calendars.

Fyi: I knew my SO through mutual friends in high school before we started dating. Back then he had hair almost to his shoulder blades. Also, he kept a calendar print-out each month with all sorts of random pseudo-holidays on it - talk like a pirate day, pi day, etc. 




 Like, 95% of the time. I dunno if it's just because the shelf we keep our condoms on is on my side of the bed, or if it's merely habit, but my SO almost never puts on his own condom. 




 Nope, not overreacting at all. If a guy did that to me I'd be pissed. This dude sounds like a class-A douche. Slut-shaming, anti-abortion, yet he thinks it's totally okay to have sex with you while not using protection, cum inside you anyway knowing that you're not using any form of birth control, and laughs at you for being upset? I don't know why you were every with this guy in the first place, to be honest.

I would seriously advise you to cut this guy out of your life. Clearly he doesn't respect your body, your consent, or women in general. NOT boyfriend material, at least imho. 




 That's the cost for an electronic transfer to any account that's outside their system. You can get checks but they highly discourage you from doing this and I have no idea how they work. 




 That's exactly the kind of account I was talking about. But our university automatically disperses your financial aid to these accounts. I'm not sure if there's an option to get it sent to a private bank account instead. 




 That's tough. It's really hard for people to come out to others, especially when they're that young, and then have those few people completely phase out of their lives. It sucks, because you feel like you lose the only support you had.

I would definitely suggest you talk to your friend. Just call him up or send him a text asking what's up, and if there was some particular reason you haven't been hanging out as much lately. It's possible he's just been really busy lately.

If that isn't the case and he's actually uncomfortable with you being gay, you'll be able to address that as well, although it might be a lot more complicated. Hopefully it goes well, though.

Good luck! 




 I think the 80-90% communication thing is definitely true. OP and OP's boyfriend really just need to sort out the communication issue, and then the rest will be rather manageable. 




 Feasibly? No. It is possible, but the ATMs on those accounts limit us to a rather low withdrawal amount per day. So we would have to make several bank trips across multiple days to transfer all the money. It's super annoying. So we're all basically forced to use the accounts the university gives us unless we want to spend a whole lot of time withdrawing and depositing cash, or paying a $25 transaction fee if we want to send the money to another bank account. 




 I graduated high school in 2010, so still fairly recently. 




 If you're going to combine finances, you need to actually combine them.

This might not actually be possible for the OP. I'm actually in a similar boat, where I'm living with my partner and another roommate and we all depend on financial aid. My SO has a full scholarship that pays for residence and meal plans, while I only have partial scholarships and grants that cover my tuition while I have to take out loans to pay for everything else.

Although it might not be the same situation for OP, my university automatically disperses financial aid funds to special accounts set up individually for each student. It is also nigh-impossible to transfer this money to other accounts, as it's much more headache than it's worth with the processing times and fees accrued. So we don't really have a choice - all of us are automatically working from separate accounts. The only way we can budget properly is by communicating to each other how much we are spending. 




 No, it's totally reasonable for you to be upset about this. Mishandling money that should have gone toward rent could have ended with you being evicted if you hadn't had someone willing to give you money to make up the rest. And speaking as someone who also has to live frugally off of residual funds from school, I know how every dollar counts. Being flat broke at the end of the semester is a common occurance for me.

You should tell your bf that financial decisions (especially when they effect both of you) should be made together. The fact that he went and made decisions without you shows that he doesn't trust you fully. He should be less worried about you getting mad at him (like it seems he was, leading him to not tell you about your money problems) and more upfront about what's going on. Otherwise, how can you help when things like this happen?

Also, what if for whatever reason an unexpected expense came up and you were even more strapped for cash than you are now? What if your car broke down or one of you ended up sick or in the E.R. and had medical bills to pay? You both need to be aware of how much money you have so that you can respond appropriately in these sorts of situations. 




 I know mine all did. And due to budget issues, a lot of them were incredibly old ... and incredibly racist, just like *Lies* talks about. 




 I would say that you should do whatever makes you happy. If you want to date someone, do it. If not, don't. You shouldn't have to because you feel like someone your age "should be" doing anything.

As far as not being out to everyone, though, I think you shouldn't worry about that either. Not a whole lot of GSRM people are out to every single person in their life. Sometimes that just isn't practical, or it would put them in danger. So no, you shouldn't have to be out to everyone in order to try to find a partner.

Of course, if you do end up finding someone and dating long-term, it will be harder to keep in the closet as that person becomes a bigger and bigger part of your life. However, at that point it will be up to you and your partner to decide if/when you should reveal your relationship to other people. 




 I'm asexual, so this basically describes all my relationships. I'm not attracted to people physically, I'm with them because I enjoy their company. 




 No, I'd say you're correct. Of course you choose whether or not to ask someone else out on a date, or to have relationships with certain people. However, you cannot control who you have feelings for. It's just a part of who we are.

I've actually used food analogies several times to help explain sexuality to people. For instance, some people might really like ice cream or cake but they're on a diet so they can't eat sweets (celibacy). Some people really like certain foods, but over time get sick of eating them a lot so they start eating other things. Or perhaps they might not think they like a certain kind of food but after trying it they realize it's not so bad (sexual preferences sometimes change). Other people are convinced they won't like a food, try it, and end up hating it (sometimes they don't change). And some people really crave things like spicy food, while other people have almost no tolerance; some people only want to eat spicy food occasionally while others will eat particular spicy dishes they're used to but not all spicy foods (asexuality/gray-a/demi spectrum). 




 I have problems recognizing when someone likes me sometimes too. I'll be going along, minding my own business, thinking I'm just good friends with somebody, and suddenly out of nowhere they confess their love to me. This has happened to me like three times. And then I look back and go, "wait, so those times they were saying this or that they were actually flirting..."

It's a bit annoying. 




 Wow, what a difference! Congratulations, I hope you continue to be happy and healthy! 




 Yeah I went for generic descriptor here, but on /r/outhere it's Oh So Squishy, which has gotten a few fans apparently 




 That is an awesome story. Also I love your flair, btw. 




 I think a card saying something like "your bravery is an inspiration" or "I hope your transition goes well and that you have a happy future" would be really sweet to get, especially from someone who they might not know that well. I bet it would make her pretty happy, and who knows, maybe you'll end up being friends? 




 I would love to see a Misty with full sleeves. Just sayin'. 




 That sounds like asexual to me. You should probably look around on the AVEN website or wiki (links in the sidebar) and read up on some things. Then just explore and see what works for you. 




 To be fair though, Tom Bombadil was a pretty unnecessary character, at least in the first book. I'm really glad he got cut out from the trilogy movies, tbh. 




 I too was disappointed by a distinct lack of Strong Belwas. 




 Now that I think about it, book and TV Littlefinger are pretty different. In the books everyone is constantly writing him off as not that big a deal. He's really useful, but no one really seems to understand the extent to which he is manipulating others or how far he is willing to go to get what he wants.

Meanwhile in the show, everyone seems to be relatively well aware that Littlefinger is a backstabbing asshole but he's still really necessary so they can't get rid of him. 




 I know what you're going through. This sort of thing is really rough. It feels terrible whenever the person that you've committed to and want to build a relationship with turns out to not be trustworthy. Whenever I found out, I felt hurt, and betrayed. But I also felt shitty because it felt like I wasn't *good enough*. Or that I was an idiot and should have seen it coming. That sort of reaction is perfectly normal.

You really shouldn't worry about what your friends and family think. It will probably suck for a little while whenever someone asks you about how your SO is doing and you have to tell them you aren't together anymore. But I'm sure most of them will be supportive, and try to be there for you rather than make fun of you or anything.

You aren't naive or silly for liking him. You can't really control your feelings for other people or pick who you fall in love with. And everyone falls in love with someone at some point who turns out to be less spectacular than what they thought. You shouldn't feel guilty or insecure for being a human being who has human emotions and makes human mistakes. Don't beat yourself up about it. You didn't do anything wrong, he did.

Honestly, I know that hearing the "you'll get over it line" sucks but it is somewhat true. In time, your feelings will start to fade a little bit. I think now would probably be a good time for you to do some introspection. Focus on the things you like about yourself and what you want from life. Reflect on what you'll do differently in the future. That sort of thing. Just take time to sort through your emotions and thoughts. The trip you mentioned might be a good time for that.

If you need anything please let me know! We're all here for you. :

Also, it just so happens that my first name starts with an "M" and I would love a tie clip ~~ 




 Sounds like you're asexual to me. You can still get checked out by a doctor if you want, but there is nothing inherently wrong with not being attracted to other people or desiring sex. So don't stress too much. : 




 Speaking as someone who has depression, it sounds to me like you're depressed. I would suggest going to see a therapist. They might be able to suggest therapy or medication that could help you start to feel better. I know it helped me a little.

That said, I know what you're going through is rough. It can be so difficult to find the energy to just keep existing. But you just have to do it. Because eventually, things might get better. I really hope things do get better for you. But in the mean time, we're all here for you. 




 As far as your sexuality goes, to me it sounds like you're somewhere between demi and gray (both?). That's not really anything to stress out about, though. And honestly, you shouldn't have to feel guilty about not wanting sex. You're different from most people, but that's okay, and as long as your partner is happy and love you there shouldn't be a problem.

However, the painful sex is definitely an issue. Sex should never be painful (unless it's intentional because you're kinky like that). I would suggest talking to a gyno about that. 




 Of course it is. I still plan on getting married. Although if I do have kids, I'll adopt. 




 Well if that's your only regret in transitioning, I'd say you're doing pretty okay. ; 




 Daaaaaaaaaaaaamn. 




 Yes, because I consider the community to be more than just strictly for lesbians, gay people, bisexual people, or transgender people. The acronym isn't really that inclusive, but is usually shorthand for the community of all people who aren't strictly heterosexual and cisgender. Some people are now using GSRM, which is more inclusive of those who fall outside the traditional four categories.

I have, however, gotten some resistance from other members, especially cisgender gay people. Of course, these are the same sort of people who usually say that bisexuality isn't a thing and that trans* people don't belong either, so I don't really listen to them. 




 I actually had to read some of Jared Diamond's work and watch a documentary featuring him and his ideas for an intro anthropology course. I remember sitting there the whole time thinking, "this is stupid. This guy is racist, he has quite possibly the biggest white savior complex I've ever seen, and his theory is so simplistic." I'm glad I'm not the only one who recognized that this guy has some problems. 




 Thanks for the help. I will report them for sure if they try to send me anything.

Thank you for your apology, although from what I've seen this person is in a very tiny minority of users in /r/asoiaf. Nearly everyone else has been really welcoming and awesome, so I won't let them scare me off! 




 Seriously, I don't understand you. All I wanted to do was talk about something I like with other people who like it too. Instead, I get an outcry about why I don't belong here because I haven't finished the books *even though the rules of the subreddit state this is perfectly okay.* When people try to tell me that I might get spoiled I respond by saying it shouldn't be an issue as long as everyone follows the rules, and that I'll take my chances because I came here to have fun and participate in discussion.

So instead of letting it go, you insist that I'm a dick for wanting to be here and now you're going to do the EXACT THING that you and everyone else has been warning me about? Self-fulfilling prophecy much? But apparently I'm still the dick. Whatever dude, seems like you're the one with the problem here, not me - I've had plenty of good discussion and pleasant exchanges with other people on this thread and in this sub in general. Right now you're the only one who is acting like a stubborn dick, really. 




 Well, I thought I was being pretty reasonable. Just asking people to follow the rules and not worry about me doesn't qualify as being a dick, at least in my opinion. And telling me to get out is not helping me, fyi.

Also, I find it hard to believe that you perceiving my tone as hostile is proof of me being a dick while you and other people constantly telling me to get out isn't being a dick. 




 Of course it would get rid of the "you shouldn't be here" argument, hypothetically, but I don't know if it would make the situation any less threatening for trans* folks, since they would then potentially have to contend with two groups of cis people who might not want them there instead of just one. Sharing bathrooms won't take away the prejudices that a lot of people have, at least not right away. So it might get better in the long run, but I imagine it might get worse in the short term.

It would be really great though if this sort of thing were no longer an issue. 




 Ok, I laughed. ngl 




 It depends on the person, I think. 




 I don't normally post pics online, but what the hey.

https://scontent-a-iad.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/969507_10151240118682255_928045531_n.jpg

I'm on the left, with my SO on the right. 




 Honestly, I feel like people don't give kids enough credit. The whole "how do we explain it to the children?" argument is used a lot when discussing sexuality or gender identity or any of that stuff. Adults tend to assume that explaining that someone is any form of LGBTQ will confuse children, or even potentially harm them. But in reality, children are often far more understanding about that sort of thing. You explain to them that Uncle Bob is gay because he loves other guys and they usually say something like "okay. Let's go play now." They really don't care.

I would say the same thing applies to polyamory. "Sometimes Mommy and Daddy like to have other partners." "Oh, okay. Can I watch Spongebob?" Really not that hard. And if they have questions, just answer them the best you can and don't act ashamed about it. 




 Honestly, no, I wouldn't be that comfortable, because we live in a terrible world where violence against women is an unfortunate reality. Also, a lot of trans* people have bathroom issues, and I'm not sure lumping everyone together in one big one would help matters much.

Theoretically, though, if we lived in a society where none of the above was an issue, I wouldn't really mind. Of course, I would agree with the other comments though about having proper stalls. No huge gaps underneath the doors or walls, and no cracks in the doors that let you see people. Those are terrible enough in our current bathrooms, ugh. 




 Your parents were definitely abusing you, and sounds like they are either in denial or are trying to [gaslight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting) you about it. That is not okay. None of the things you described are in any way okay.

I am so glad to hear that you are going to get away from them soon. Please take care of yourself. Also, I don't know how the laws work where you live, but I know that in the U.S. where I am if someone files a missing person's report on you and you are an adult they can't force you to come back if the authorities find you. In fact, this is often used as justification to abandon a case if there isn't any evidence of foul play. So I wouldn't worry about that too much. 




 Arousal and attraction are not the same, although they can overlap. While it is possible that you are demi, the fact that you experience physical arousal doesn't necessarily mean you aren't asexual either. Honestly, female bodies are prone to lubrication even if they definitely don't want sex (even during sexual assault), so it's pretty safe to say that if physiological response isn't always linked to a willingness to have sex or an attraction to someone.

Not all asexual people have no sex drive. Ultimately the decision is up to you, but identifying as asexual doesn't mean you can't want to or enjoy having sex with your partner. It just means you aren't physically attracted to people. 




 Like previous commenters have said, follow through is really important. It takes time but you have to walk the walk. Don't just try to tell her that she can trust you, but SHOW her you are trustworthy, again and again. Eventually this will help her feel safer with you.

Also, it would certainly help if you just ask her if you can help and how. Not only will it give you some actually effective ideas, but it will demonstrate to her that you care about her needs and feelings.

And don't be afraid to mess up sometimes. Not everyone is perfect. But if you make a conscious and willing effort to fix your mistakes, that says a lot about your character and the lengths you will go to in order to have a healthy relationship with this girl. 




 I really don't get along well with women who thrive on drama. I am very much anti-drama, so women who are really gossipy or in any way double-faced really don't work for me. But then, the same goes for people in general, not just women. 




 When I first started dating my SO we were monogamous, and we tried to open up and it worked out terribly the first time. The main issues we had were a lack of communication, as well as the fact that I really wasn't ready for it at the time, and then the other person he was dating (and one of her other partners I had contact with) all treated me like some afterthought. All in all it was just not a very good situation. Our relationship was seriously rocky for a while. But eventually he stopped seeing the other partner, we worked everything out, and for a while we went back to being mono.

It's been nearly two years since then, and we're in a much healthier place now. A few months ago, I brought up the idea of having an open relationship with my SO. This time around we were both frank about our feelings, and what we wanted. He still had the desire to date other people, and I had developed a crush on someone else as well. So now we're open again. This time things have worked out much better because we're more open and honest with each other, and we approached the situation with mutual respect. Now he is freely looking for other partners, I can freely pursue my crush, but our relationship with each other is even stronger. We're a lot happier now.

So I would say that yes, going from closed to open can certainly work, but it can also go wrong if you go about it the wrong way. You need to maintain open communication, respect for everyone involved, honesty, and adherence to whatever boundaries all of you decide upon. 




 "I'm not racist, but..." 




 Smart kid. xD 




 If you ever find yourself saying the words "but I didn't mean it to be offensive," odds are you really need to re-examine what you're saying. 




 This might also be good for /r/pettyrevenge - that is some petty revenge if I ever saw it. 




 I'm suddenly really glad that I'm allergic to rabbit and have therefore never bought angora yarn. 




 That's the sort of thing I was talking about! Of course OP might not have had their wrist broken so maybe they don't need as long of a break. They can probably experiment and see what works for them. Still, though, the idea is that you need to avoid constant strain, so short breaks and stretches are probably a really good idea. 




 No, sorry - I haven't used one. 




 Making my own patterns for items that are fitted. Right now I'm working on a long-sleeved shirt and tunic for a Link cosplay. It will be quite the adventure. 




 Fantastic! I'm jelly. : 




 So jealous. I need a ball winder really bad :/

I've got one on my Christmas wish list, though, so hopefully I might get one too :D 




 I've done a little of my own pattern work, as well as freehanding. The one thing to keep in mind, I think, is to be aware that YOU WILL MAKE MISTAKES. This is inevitable, and part of the learning process. Even if you've made dozens of your own patterns before you will still make things that end up looking wonky sometimes. So don't be afraid to frog it and try again!

Something that might help would be to take existing patterns that are a bit simpler and making alterations to them. It will help you understand how shapes work, and how you can manipulate them. 




 I've had problems with my wrist getting my sore and my hand cramping up while trying to crochet too fast for too long.

A wrist brace will probably help, and also try to take regular breaks. Like, crochet for 50 min. of an hour, and take a break for the last 10 minutes or something. That way you aren't getting a constant strain. 




 That's adorable! I've actually been thinking about making a cowl to look like the Traveler. I bought the yarn and everything, just haven't started yet. I'll be making my own pattern so I've been procrastinating because it will involve a lot of swatching and I hate swatching. 




 Well usually when people ask me to make stuff for them I just start explaining all the work that goes into it. They'll ask me for a Dr. Who scarf and I'll say, well I need 7 colors of yarn at approximately $5 or so a skein, plus a set of straight needles which will be around $10 or so, so you've already spent about $45. Now it will take me at least a month to make it since I'll be working on it in my spare time between classes and other projects. So if you paid me per hour at minimum wage that scarf would be hundreds of dollars. Sound good?

Of course I never actually charge an hourly rate, just enough to make it worth my time and get a little profit. Perhaps the best way to show people how much time, effort, and money this sort of thing takes is to just hang out with them while you make something. You can physically show them how much work you can get done within the few hours you're together. Then you can estimate how much longer it would take to finish the entire project. Usually when people see me working on something and I tell them how long I've already been at it they gain a lot more respect for what I do. 




 I'm making this a text post because I don't really need karma for this, I just wanted to gush a little bit.

Recently I had an artist's table at a local convention. It was only the second time I've done this and the first time I had to do it by myself. Also, nearly all of the stuff I made this time around was from my own patterns and designs, rather than using other people's patterns (with permission, of course) like I did last time.

This is kind of a big deal for me, as I've had a lot of trouble trying to get a "real job" while also being in school and dealing with anxiety and depression issues. However, starting my tiny crafting business has really helped me, not only because I got to destress while making things (isn't knitting so relaxing?) but also because it's given me a lot of self confidence. So many people came by my booth. Some of them bought my stuff, but even those who didn't had a lot of compliments about how cute all my stuff was or how impressed they were with the time and effort I put into it.

Also, a guy from a group called The Dish Out, which promotes underground artists, happened to come by and asked me for an interview. [Here's the link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_ZoItG6IBw), if you're interested.

I know that this post might be a little off-topic compared to the usual  fare here, but I wanted to share my experience with you because I hope that some of you will be encouraged by it. I have spent many hours across the years being frustrated, starting and restarting projects, giving up and then coming back to it. But knitting is such a great hobby, and if you stick with it I hope that when the day comes where someone recognizes your skill you'll feel it was incredibly rewarding, just like I did.

So to all you new knitters out there, keep going! You have a lot of great stuff waiting for you down the road. And for all of you more experienced stitchers, I hope you've enjoyed it as much as I have! Hopefully we can all continue to have such positive experiences in the future. 




 So after many weeks of reading a few chapters here and there between classes and before bed, I finally finished A Storm of Swords. I only started reading after I saw all of the HBO series that's been released so far, so I really enjoyed seeing the incredible amount of detail that was left out of the show. But JEEZ is this book long or what? I haven't been as big a reader as I used to be since I started college, so this one felt like running a marathon after I hadn't done much besides walking around the block for the last four years.

So a few things I've noticed so far are that Season 3 ends at right about the 50% mark of the third book. However, the last scene of Daenerys liberating the slaves is put at the end of the show, while there are several chapters after that point which were also in the show but put in earlier. I have to wonder if the producers of the show did that because they thought Dany's scene was more dramatic, or if there was maybe some other reason influencing the decision.

Speaking of Daenerys, I'm also curious to see the direction they're taking in the show with her advisors, particularly Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy. In the books, Barristan knows that Jorah was spying on Daenerys for Varys and King Robert, but this isn't revealed until just before the battle for Meereen, after Barristan's true identity is revealed. In the show, however, Barristan tells Daenerys who he is right away, and if I recall correctly he doesn't seem to be aware of Jorah's disloyalty because he was banned from small council meetings (even though this is exactly how he knew in the books). I'm wondering how the betrayal will play out because of these alterations.

Another topic I've been pondering is the fate of the remaining Starks. It seems to me like as soon as they start getting separated bad things happen, and the thought process seems to be that if only they could reunite everything would work out. Nearly everyone thinks that Arya has been dead the whole time, Sansa is being shuttled along from man to man and has no contact with the rest of her family, Jon is stuck doing his duty around the Wall, and Bran and Rickon have to remain unseen so that no one knows they're still alive. It's really terrible to see how cut off they are from one another, and how lonely each of them feels because of it, especially once they all hear about Robb and Catelyn dying at the Red Wedding. But at this point I'm not sure that getting them all back together would help anything. Sure, it would be nice to see them happy again, at least for a little while, but odds are something else would go wrong and they all really would get wiped out.

Well I've been rambling long enough. Does anyone else have any theories about some of the changes we'll see from the books as we start Season 4? Or perhaps some thoughts about the ending of ASOS? Because that one really threw me for a loop. 




 A recurring topic I've seen lately, both here on this subreddit and in other places, is how identifying as asexual fits in with sexual relationships, masturbation, or finding people's bodies aesthetically pleasing. There seems to be some general confusion, not only from people who are outside or new to the community, but also from some people who apparently have been with us for a while. So I wanted to bring this up for discussion.

Many people I've talked to, as well as those who come to the subreddit looking for advice on identity, have issues with these subjects. Most people define asexuality simply as "not being sexually attracted to any sex or gender." But then some people will say, "I don't want to have sex, although I still find some people cute." Or perhaps, "I masturbate, but it's mostly just a routine or chore." Or, if you're like me, you might have a sexual partner and regularly engage in sex with them.

I just wanted to emphasize the idea that *none of these things* negates your asexual identity. Not all asexual people are the same. Some aces enjoy sex or masturbating, but that sex drive isn't really directed at a certain person or group of people. Some ace people can look at a person and think, "they're an attractive person," but they don't want to have sex with them or anyone else who looks attractive.

To me, as long as you aren't sexually attracted to any sex or gender, like the definition above, it doesn't matter if you find people aesthetically pleasing or if you masturbate or watch porn or have sex. Because all of those things aren't necessarily related to your sexuality or how your identify.

How about the rest of /r/asexuality? What do you all think? And how do you all feel about these sorts of things? 









 Background: I'm 21f and asexual, dating a 21m straight guy. We've been together now for over 5 years.

Just a few months ago, my SO and I decided to try having an open relationship. I developed a crush on a close friend and he's expressed polyamorous inclinations for a long time now. So we mutually agreed that we wanted to date other people, but still keep our current relationship.

For the last few weeks, my SO has been trying to date various women he's found attractive, knowing that he has my blessing - after all, if he is able to get sex from multiple sources it really takes some pressure off of me, considering my orientation. However, he's been pretty much unsuccessful. Nearly every person he's talked to has said they are too busy for a relationship, already like someone else, or think he's really great but just "not their type." He is very understanding of their needs and reasons, of course, but it also sucks for him because he is a little disappointed. He's gotten somewhat depressed and frustrated lately with the whole situation.

I'm sort of in a dilemma over this, because I don't really know how to comfort him (or if I even should). It's a little weird for me, because I want him to be happy, but at the same time I feel like saying "well at least you have me, right? So you aren't totally lonely!" That doesn't really help, though. I know he's disappointed because he's trying his best but not getting anywhere, and he probably feels like he's not that attractive if no one really wants to date him. But on the other hand, I feel like the whole "woe is me" thing is a little bit sore for me since it's making me feel like I don't count for anything. Of course I know he loves me and appreciates me, it's just that there's this tiny little part of me that wants to be upset about the fact that he's acting as if he's foreveralone when I'm still here.

Am I weird for feeling that way? I'm trying really hard here to be mature and understanding, as he is certainly much more poly than I am (the crush I mentioned earlier is the first crush I've had - ever - and I'm not terribly into relationships in general). I guess I'm just a little confused about what to do here and I could use some advice.

Thanks for reading. 




 After watching all three seasons in the span of a week during this past summer, I soon started reading the books and I've really enjoyed seeing the differences between the two - especially the elaborations that the books give.

Right now I'm partway through A Storm of Swords, and I just recently read the section where Tyrion is attending a small council meeting after Tywin arrives at King's Landing and assumes his position as the Hand. As the council members were all discussing the war, the subject of the Vale came up. At this point, Lysa Arryn is still insisting on doing nothing except keeping her son bottled up in their castle where the nasty Lannisters can't get them, but of course this could change at any time and they need assurance she won't later decide to join Robb's (or any other potential king's) cause.

Littlefinger suggested that, since he is now a lord, he can marry Lysa and bring up her young son to be a loyal subject of King Joffrey. And he should leave right away - after all, it is autumn and the seas will soon be stormy, and he can't exactly marry Lysa if he drowns before he can get there. Everyone agrees, except Tyrion, who points out that they will no longer have a master of coin. So the others suggest Tyrion can do it, and Tywin agrees, as Tyrion had recently complained to him that his father never let him do anything important.

The clever part? Littlefinger leaves before Joffrey's wedding to Margaery Tyrell, and this wedding is going to be SUPER expensive. Oh, and the treasury is empty. Oh, and Tywin won't forgive the crown's debts to the Lannisters because if Tyrion can't make this work he wasn't worth much anyway. Oh, and on top of this there is still a war going on. Oh, and it was Littlefinger's suggestion that Tyrion take is job in the first place.

Of course Littlefinger's suggestion to marry Lysa and then essentially become Lord of the Eyrie (in practice if not in name, as the title technically belongs to Lysa's son) is yet another example of him being very ambitious. But I'm also pretty sure that he felt just as much satisfaction dumping Tyrion with the mess that was the royal wedding and laughing to himself while someone else, especially someone he doesn't seem to particularly like, has to deal with the headache.

Edit: I find it interesting how most of the comments have been about how I should be careful of spoilers rather than actually discussing anything in this post. They way I saw it, this post contains spoilers for ASOS so I had to label it that way regardless of what sorts of spoilers I was expecting ... Anyway, I get that I need to finish the books (and I will) but until then let's get back on topic maybe?

Edit 2: Names are hard. I have new appreciation for Robert Baratheon's impatience with titles. 




 I made a post last week [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/outhere/comments/1ovmxf/its_asexual_awareness_week_and_i_think_im_ready/) about my decision to come out to everyone I knew on facebook as asexual. A few people expressed interest and gave me well wishes, so I figured I'd post an update in case anyone is curious.

Strangely enough, most of the week went without much fanfare. The first posts I made, which were changing my profile picture and cover photo, got a few likes, even from family members. But I hadn't actually said explicitly that I was asexual at that point so for all anyone knew I was just being an ally like all those people who changed their prof pics to the HRC equals sign logo.

Next I posted the link to the Huff Post series on asexuality (which I also posted already on this subreddit), mentioning that people should read it if "you're curious about my identity." Suddenly, a few of the likes on my earlier pics disappeared, most notably the ones from my family members. As I live in a different city about an hour and a half away from my hometown I haven't seen or talked to any of these relatives so I have no idea what they think. The silence is deafening.

In better news, though, a few of my friends liked my posts, including articles, diagrams, and videos. One friend liked and commented on almost everything throughout the week and asked a few questions, and was completely cool with it. Another said he was a little confused because he was raised in a conservative religious household but he genuinely wanted to learn more so we'll skype together sometime soon and I can answer his questions. But the best part of the week was getting a message from an old high school friend I hadn't seen in years. Apparently she is also asexual and had come out to a few LGBT friends in the past, but they didn't respond well so she'd remained completely in the closet ever since then. After seeing all my articles, it gave her hope and joy to see that she wasn't the only person who shared this identity. I was really excited that I could do something positive for her, even if she wasn't ready to come out yet!

Although I'm still somewhat anxious about the people's reactions I haven't seen in person yet, I'm relieved that I came out. I feel like being in the closet is so anxiety producing because of all the uncertainties - how will people react? What if something bad happens? But now even if bad things happen I can actually do something about it instead of worrying all the time.

Well, enough about me! I know how difficult and scary it is to be open with people about your sexuality, so I just wanted to say that I will continue to encourage everyone else on here until they are ready to take that step themselves. Coming out is a long, hard, exhausting process, and you all have been here for me, so I hope I can do the same for others. : 









 For a long time I've been out to close friends but I've never discussed my orientation with family or with acquaintances or more casual friends before college. I've been on the fence for a long time about telling more people, especially my mom, but I kept finding excuses not to bring it up. "It's not relevant to the conversation right now." "I don't want to make them stressed out or worried about me." "I don't know if they'll accept me."

Well, I'm tired of excuses. Lately I've been coming out to more and more people, because I'm sick and tired of asexuality being a fringe group that no one knows about. I want recognition. I want people to see me for who I am. I don't want to be ignored any longer, in queer or straight spaces.

So this week, which is Asexuality Awareness Week, I have changed my facebook profile picture and banner to ace-related pictures. I'll be posting videos and articles that I find. If someone asks me about my identity, I will proudly say, "yes! I am asexual. It's just one factor in all the things that make me awesome." I don't want to hide because I'm afraid of judgement anymore.

I hope you all wish me luck, and I'll continue to support all of you as well :D 




 I've been following /r/knitting for a while now, and I love all the awesome stuff that's posted here! Especially some of the really cool socks. Often whenever I find a cool pattern I'm inspired to try it out and make it myself!

The only problem is, most sock yarns use wool. Like, at least 50% wool. And I'm terribly allergic to wool - I will break out in hives that don't go away for almost a week. It's painful and itchy and generally miserable. As I have yet to find a sock yarn at any of my local craft stores, I am kept from knitting awesome socks unless I want to turn into a giant rash.

Have any of you knitters out there found good sock yarns that don't use wool? I'm used to working with acrylic and other synthetics as they're usually pretty cheap, but I don't mind spending a little bit of extra money here - after all, socks are usually a pretty small project so I won't need to buy much. Please help me out of you find something you think would work! Thanks in advance :D

Edit: Thanks for all the helpful suggestions you guys! I'm really excited to try some of these out and finally be able to make some really awesome knitted socks. 




 I like to browse this subreddit for discussions about various VNs, but something that seems to pop up a lot would be posts that say something like this:

"I just finished [insert game here], and I really liked it. Can you guys recommend more games without nudity/H-scenes/sex scenes?"

It seems like it would make things a lot easier for everyone if we had a master post that was linked to in the sidebar which had a list of VNs that either didn't have H-scenes or had the option to turn them off. Or at the very least, it would be nice if we had a place to link them to whenever someone posted yet another thread like this. 




 So, yesterday I went out with my SO and our roommate. We're all 21, I'm a woman, SO is a man, roommate is a trans man (although he's been doing HRT for half a year now so he usually passes really well). We were out running errands and then had dinner, and last thing we did was run by our local Gamestore (not real name). All of us are really into video games and I think between the three of us we currently have half a dozen pre-orders for things, lol.

Anyway, we were in Gamestore and browsing around. We met another customer there who seemed pretty nice, roommate and I chatted him up about RPGs. SO was checking out controllers. And then roommate and I decided to ask for applications since we knew they'd be looking for temps for the holiday rush. Gamestore employee went to give us applications, and told us about a job fair coming up. We both took an application, I bought a game, and we all left.

After we got home roommate asked me, "Did you get a weird vibe from Gamestore employee or was it just me?" I replied, "Yes, totally!" Even though Gamestore employee didn't say anything to the effect, his body language and attitude made us both really wary. We had both gotten a feeling from him that he didn't like either of us. Roommate commented on how whenever I went to ask for an application too the employee seemed to look at me like, "what do *you* want an application for, you're a girl."

Again, none of this was ever explicitly stated, it was just the feelings we both happen to get. But whenever we asked my SO about it, he said he had no idea what we were talking about - he was totally oblivious to the exchange. Roommate and I chalked it up to "woman senses" - as he was also brought up as a woman, we were both conditioned to pick up on these sorts of things while my SO, a cis man, had never been made to.

Do you TwoX ladies know what I'm talking about? Do you ever get vibes like this? If so, share some of your stories! I'd like to hear them. 




 For those of you who aren't aware, asexuality is a thing. And a lot of aces (asexual people), like myself, have had many discussions about the community initialisms like QUILT-BAG or LGBTQIA (or any other variant) and what the A should stand for. Depending on who you ask, the A stands for Ally, or Asexual, or both. But a lot of ace people have a problem with this. Someone [recently posted something](http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1mep6a/reasons_why_i_need_the_a_in_lgbtiaq_to_stand_for/) to the effect in /r/asexuality.

I for one agree with the sentiment the OP expressed in that thread. Often, aces are completely ignored or dismissed, not just by straight cis people but also by the queer community. We just aren't acknowledged in most cases. But setting that aside, I wanted to address why I believe that having a special initial for allies is somewhat problematic. The most straightforward way to go about it is just to say that allies are not members of the LGBTQ community.

So, I realize that this sentiment is not held by all LGBTQ people and I will most likely offend some allies by saying this. But hear me out. I'd like to illustrate why I believe this with another example.

Say you are a Christian. And say that you have a friend who lives down the street who is Jewish. You hang out together a lot, and their family really likes you, so you often participate in some of their culture. Maybe you went to temple services with your friend a few times. Maybe you visited them at Hanukkah and exchanged gifts. You probably went to their Bar/Bat Mitzvah. You have different faiths, but you've always been supportive of your friend and try to stand up for them whenever someone else acts in a way that is anti-Semitic. Does this make you Jewish? Does this make you part of the Jewish community?

I would say no. At the end of the day, you go home to your family and you are still a Christian. You associate with them and you certainly aren't hostile, but you are not one of them.

I think the same sentiment applies to the LGBTQ community. Allies are great. They can be excellent friends, and they are certainly helpful when it comes to accomplishing positive change for our community. But they are not members of our community. They don't face our same struggles. They don't have the same experiences. At the end of the day, they go home and get back to their lives outside of helping us. So I really don't think they should be considered part of the community or get an initial.

Of course, this is not to say that I am not thankful for the help of allies or that they shouldn't be acknowledged for their own struggles. I just don't think they should be prioritized in such a way that they are considered full members of our community, especially since there are other GSM groups that still aren't fully acknowledged such as aces, or people who are agender or otherwise genderqueer.

Edit: Since there seems to be some confusion on the matter, the way I view things, allies are not a part of the LGBTQ community, but rather a separate group that works with us in order to promote change, especially against those straight/cis people who try to actively oppress us.

Edit 2: I am also of the philosophy that differences should be acknowledged and celebrated rather than ignored. I think it's much more meaningful when two people come together and say "You and I are different, but that's okay, let's be friends and work together," than when someone says "You and I are exactly the same because we're both human and that's all that matters." Not that the sentiment of the second statement isn't nice, it's just that it ignores the reality of most people's situations in the real world. 









 I apologize in advance for long text.

So, I'm a 21F panromantic ace, and for a long time now I've been developing feelings for a while now toward an old friend of mine (22F bisexual); we'll call her Lilly. I want to tell her about how I feel but things are kinda complicated so I'm not sure how to approach the situation.

It's important to note that I'm already in a relationship with a 21M (straight). We've been together for over five years now so this is a thing that will not end anytime soon. I really love him and I don't want to end my relationship with him at all. Also, he is completely aware of my feelings for Lilly, and we're in an open relationship, so this does not bother him.

But back to Lilly. Basically, we've known each other for the past seven or eight years; we were really good friends all throughout high school, and although we went to different colleges we've kept in touch. I still try to visit her whenever I can, although we don't spend nearly enough time together she's always happy to see me and it hasn't diminished our friendship at all.

Last year, Lilly came out to me as bi. She'd already known I was queer for some time, so she knew I'd be okay with it, but it was still a really big step for her. We both grew up in a pretty conservative religious community. She still isn't out to most of the people we know from our hometown because she's afraid of judgement from them. In fact, when she came out to me it was the first time she'd ever admitted she was bisexual out loud. As important as that moment was for her, I think it was really a turning point for me too. I don't know when I started to like her as more than a friend, and I wasn't always aware of these feelings, but when she came out to me I feel like suddenly something clicked in my brain. She wasn't completely unavailable to me, so I started entertaining thoughts of her beyond the purely platonic.

Since we've been friends for a long time we naturally talk about each other's relationships. She comes to me for advice all the time on how to deal with various people she's dated. And I've noticed that whenever she tells me about how she wants certain things from the person she dates, such as someone who can carry on long intellectual conversations but at the same time be silly with her, I find my self thinking "I could be that for you." And whenever she tells me about cute girls she hangs out with, I think "I wish you would go on picnics or get coffee with me instead." I'm not normally a jealous person, but I can't help but envy the people she tells me about a little because they get to experience things with her I've never been able to.

I've been reflecting on this a lot lately, and I want to tell her how I feel. But at the same time I'm conflicted about it, because she lives in a different city and I'm already in a relationship with something else. Although my current SO is okay with me seeing someone else, I don't know if Lilly would be okay with that arrangement. Not to mention that it would be hard to see her regardless, since she lives an hour and a half away. Plus I'm ace and she's sexual. I know that she's never had a serious sexual relationship with someone before (she's still a virgin, I'm pretty sure) but that doesn't mean she won't want to later on. I'm not opposed to sex (I'm relatively neutral about it) but since neither of us has had a lesbian relationship before it's a bit daunting.

If any of you have advice on what might be a good way to tell her how I feel or how to handle the logistics of a relationship (if it gets that far) I would really appreciate it. I've been really anxious about this for the past few months and I just needed to get this off my chest.

**TL;DR - I need advice on how to tell my crush how I feel about her. I've never had a crush before and my situation is complicated. Help, please!** 














 I always get a small burst of glee whenever I vote on something and it ends up being the 100th, 2000th, 550th etc. vote. I really like having even numbers for some reason. Not just multiples of tens or hundreds, either - I also like fives. Or repeating numbers like "3333" etc. 














 I just finished reading A Game of Thrones, and have read a few chapters into A Clash of Kings. I watched the series before I began reading, and while watching the show I thought that the whole story arc with Ned discovering that Joffrey was actually Cersei's bastard and not Robert's son was pretty believable. After all, there weren't exactly paternity tests back in medieval times, and unless it was entirely obvious that a kid didn't belong to one parent (i.e. the affair was discovered, or the child clearly resembled its true parent rather than the one who supposedly contributed) you stood a pretty good chance at nobody finding out about it. Cersei could easily claim that all her children just take after their mother - after all, their father was her twin brother, not some other random knight that they might resemble, so they just REALLY look like her. And in the show, there aren't really many other hints about the fact that Joffrey isn't Robert's kid outside of Ned Stark's investigations.

The book, however, was a completely different story. There are hints dropped everywhere - for instance, in the lineage book that Jon Arryn and Ned both looked at, it talked about two previous marriages between a Baratheon and a Lannister where the kids all took after the Baratheon side. There was also Sansa's comment about how Joff was not at all like his father, which made Ned finally realize the truth. At Joffrey's birthday tourney, his younger brother Tommen wears Lannister colors instead of Baratheon ones when he goes to fence. Plus, nearly every other time Joffrey or his siblings are mentioned by an outside party, they lump them in with the Lannisters by habit.

So my question is, if it was this incredibly obvious in the book that Cersei's kids aren't related at all to Robert, why aren't more people discovering this much earlier on? I know it gets revealed at large eventually, but really ... Joff is 12 years old at the beginning of the series. This seems like an AWFUL long time to keep a secret that seems so poorly hidden.

Anyone else have an opinion on this? 



















 Trigger warning for descriptions of abuse.

Okay, so, I recently went to a therapy session where I talked about some stuff from my childhood. So here's some background info - I am the oldest of three children. My mom had me when she was single, but when I was about three she married my stepdad. They then had a boy when I was five and another girl when I was nine.

We were never a totally functional family; most of this had to do with money issues, and I know my parents' marriage was terrible, as my mom was pretty much miserable all the time. Whenever I was little I assumed it was because of me (like a lot of kids do) and this caused a lot of conflict between me and my mother. Add that to the fact that my stepdad was working most of the day and then whenever he was home he was too busy drinking to ever really have much to do with us kids, and I basically ended up in an environment where I had no one to talk to about my problems.

The biggest of these problems was my younger brother. He has always been mentally unstable, and went through a wide range of possible diagnoses as a kid until about a year and a half ago when he was officially diagnosed with Asperger's and Generalized Anxiety. He not only has problems with social interaction, but he also has an extremely volatile temper; he would completely freak out at people over the littlest things that everyone else didn't really care about. I might me talking about something completely unrelated and he would take it as a personal attack against him.

And with that temper came a lot of violence. He would often get upset at me and then hit me, or break my toys, or throw whatever was closest to him at my head. As we both got bigger I retained a physical advantage for a while - I was four years older, so I was stronger and could run faster, making it relatively easy for me to run away and hide in my room whenever he started exploding. I would have to hold the door shut, though, because he would grab chairs or other large objects and literally try to break my door down in an attempt to get at me.

It only got worse once I got into high school, as he hit puberty and started catching up to me in size. I'm only 5'2" (about 159 cm). Pretty soon he was nearly as tall as I was, and about as fast. We would get in fights and I couldn't escape completely unscathed anymore. I started getting defensive wounds - welts, bruises, scrapes, pulled hair, bloody lips. And once I got to college he was actually bigger than me. I remember the first time I came back home to visit he got upset in the car whenever we went through a drivethru and I told him he shouldn't order [Vault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vault_\(soft_drink\)) (a drink that was basically a hybrid soda and energy drink) partly because he wasn't supposed to have any caffeine, and partly because as soon as he said he wanted it my little sister immediately wanted some too. That didn't go over too well. On the ride home he reached up from the back seat to punch me multiple times, tried to smother me with a pillow, and screamed and swore at me almost constantly. I was silent the whole time, as I didn't want to provoke him any further. My mom tried to calm him down but she was limited as to what she could do since she was driving.

Whenever we finally got home, I walked with my little sister up to the front door, and mom went to get some stuff out of the trunk. My brother screamed at me again for a little while and then took off around the side of the house into the back yard. I thought good riddance, maybe now he'll leave me alone. He didn't. While he was back there he grabbed a gardening stake from our vegetable patch and then came out to the front of the house again. I was still waiting by the door, since my mom was the only one who had keys. My brother started yelling at me again, and then swung the stake at my head. I threw my arm up in defense and he hit me there, leaving a huge swollen bruise. My sister jumped out in front of me and shouted at him to stop hurting me, and he nearly swung and hit her as well, but decided to just smash the stake against the house instead, which promptly shattered it and sprayed us with splinters. At this point my mom came up and let us in the house, and told my brother he was grounded and to go to his room. I was livid because I was tired of taking this shit from him and told my mom I was calling my friend and going to her house for the night. She tried to get me to stay as I started packing but at that point I was sobbing and nearly hysterical so I told her no, I couldn't, I was leaving.

On my next visit home a few weeks later I said something my brother didn't like and he ran outside, then came back in with one of the broken off pieces of that same gardening stake and tried to stab me with it. I barely managed to run into the laundry room in time to get the door between us.

After describing this story and several others to my therapist, as well as two different instances in the past year or so where I was suddenly triggered by something and started having mild panic attacks, she said I show symptoms of PTSD (although it's not full blown - I don't have enough symptoms for an actual diagnosis). At this point in my life my mother is now divorced from my stepdad and we have a good relationship. She's started to see more of my brother's temper now that I'm not there anymore to take the brunt of his anger, and she now knows what my life has been like this whole time. She's been committed to getting my brother treatment.

But I've fallen out with my stepdad over this issue. He's in complete denial about anything at all being mentally wrong with my brother, refuses to take him to therapy appointments or even regular doctors visits, and won't give him his meds for days at a time. For those of you who don't know what happens when you suddenly stop taking your antidepressants, imagine someone who goes from smoking more than a pack of cigarettes a day to quitting cold turkey. It messes you up. He's making my brother worse, and he won't acknowledge I've been abused. Every time I talk to him, he tries to guilt trip me, saying that if we get in a fight it's my fault because I'm the oldest and should know better, or that I should be more loving and supportive of my brother. He's basically facilitating the abuse, saying that I somehow deserve it while simultaneously dismissing my suffering. I couldn't handle it anymore so I stopped visiting him, and the last time I spoke to him voluntarily was two Christmases ago.

Part of the goal of my therapy is to help me deal with the trauma of the abuse, but I also want a better relationship with my dad. The problem is, the only way for us to work on our relationship is if he acknowledges the problem with my brother first, and he refuses to do that. I have really mixed feelings about my stepdad, and I don't know what I can do or say to make him understand where I'm coming from. I don't want him to apologize or make up for anything that happened in the past, I just want him to admit that it happened so we can make things better. But I don't know if that will ever happen or if I'll just end up never speaking to him again. Any advice?

**TL;DR: My brother frequently abused me from childhood up until college and it's left me with some symptoms of PTSD. But my stepdad won't acknowledge that there's anything wrong with my brother, and blames me for the abuse whenever it does occur. Now I'm not speaking to him and I don't know how to fix our relationship.**  
























 So, there's a convention this summer in my city called [Fandomfest](http://fandomfest.com/en/), and I'll be doing four hours of panels for it. One of these will be called "Bat-Girls!" - a mostly lecture-style panel about all of the women of the Batman universe.

This will be the first time that I've ever done panels for a convention let alone a Batman related one, so I figured I'd go to you all at /r/batman for any helpful suggestions you'd have for the following:

1. Which heroines should I feature/focus on? I was thinking of doing a rundown of the female Robins and Batgirls (obviously, I mean it's in the title) but are there any other noteworthy heroines I should discuss?
2. Which villains should I highlight? I think Ivy and Harley are definitely noteworthy, but what about some lesser-known ones?
3. Also, I would like any recommended readings you could suggest for each character that would show off the best aspects of each woman/girl (e.g., read issue such and such to see Barbara doing blah blah).

Thanks in advance for all of your help! I recognize that I need to do the bulk of the work, but I want this to be a really good panel for everyone in attendance and not just "watch test_subject6794 talk about all her favorite Batman moments for an hour," so some different perspectives will be greatly appreciated!

**TL;DR:** I'm doing a panel at a convention about female characters in Batman comics, movies, and shows. Thoughts? 









 Ok, so I'm a short woman (even below the "short" threshold for this subreddit) and as I was browsing through some of the comments /r/short a thought occurred to me.

For pretty much my entire life I've been made to feel insecure about my height. I was one of the tiniest kids in every class in school and I got picked on a lot because I was too small to fight back. Even close friends constantly poked fun at my size, knowing that I was insecure about it. I am also constantly mistaken for being younger than my actual age - commonly four to five years younger.

Ultimately, a lot of the teasing also affected my self-esteem; among other reasons, I felt as if I was unattractive because my physical size made me appear less mature. I was never described by anyone as "hot" - the most I would occasionally get was "you look cute." I hate that word. I constantly feel as if I am being treated like a child. It doesn't help that I also have a very young-looking face and practically no boobs. Whenever I first started dating my SO (who is 6'0"/183 cm) people would make jokes about how I was so young-looking it made him seem like a pedophile or cradle robber. Now I am approaching my 21st birthday; I applied to get a library card about two weeks ago, but the person at the desk assumed I was still in high school and needed a parent to get the card for me.

So my question to men on this subreddit would be, have you also felt that your shorter stature has made people talk down to you or patronize you as if you were still a juvenile? Or does it affect you in other ways? Do you feel like people still treat you like a boy, or is it something else?

**Edit: If your first instinct after seeing this post is to make a comment about how short people just need to suck it up or how tall people have issues too, don't. That's not the point of this thread. The point is to see if there are any differences across gender in how height discrimination affects short people.** 




 I know most people on this subreddit have questions about issues that pertain specifically to themselves, but this one is about someone else I know - I hope that's okay.

Basically, I've been dating the same guy for almost 5 years now. I love him a lot and I've gotten closer to his family over the years, including his older brother.

Now, the brother (we'll call him T) is a generally nice guy; a little nerdy, average-looking, but funny and intelligent. I'm sure he could get along well with just about anyone. But he has a problem. Whenever we spend a significant length of time hanging out, T inevitably brings up the fact that he doesn't have a girlfriend (he is a straight, cis male btw). Most people have had the single blues at one point or another, but T is severely inexperienced. He's a virgin, he's never kissed anyone, he's never been on a date, and I'm pretty sure he's never even held hands with someone. And he won't stop complaining about it. Most recently, I went with him, my SO, and their parents to one of their other relative's wedding and he skipped half the reception because he was overwhelmed with all the lovey-dovey stuff I suppose, and I had to go and console him about it for half an hour.

Now, I don't mean to be selfish - it's not just that his complaining annoys me (although it does, to some extent). I'm also really frustrated about it because I know how he feels. My current SO is the only boyfriend I've ever had, the only person I've been intimate with, and until I met him I was just as lonely and hopeless about my dating prospects as T is now. I get where he's coming from. But every time I try to talk about it he just gets really angry and upset and won't listen to anything I try to say to make him feel better. I really care about him and I know for a fact that there is at least one girl in his life who would be willing to date him, so I want to make him feel better. But I really don't know how to approach the subject since he never talks about it unless he's feeling really upset about it at the moment.

If any of you have been in his situation, or in mine, and have some helpful advice about how I should approach the situation or things I could tell him, that would be fantastic. I want to be sensitive to his feelings and I know that me hanging out with his brother all the time probably feels like we're rubbing the fact he's single in his face sometimes. But on the other hand, he's really starting to frustrate me as he constantly asks if anyone I know is single or if I'll set him up with one of my friends, and he complains A LOT about how "forever alone" he is. I just want to help him so that we'll all be happier.

**TL;DR:** My SO's brother is single and has no experience with girls. He's really depressed about it and he's starting to bum everyone else out about it too. What should I tell him? 




 Ok, so I know this is a little late since ME3 came out quite some time ago. Forgive me. I started playing the first game on a friend's xbox, but then he moved and I had no way to finish it on my ps3 until the box set came out more recently (huzzah!). It took me a while because I was kept busy by school and whatnot, but I finally finished off ME3 and now I'd like to enter the discussion about it that I've been avoiding in order to keep from getting spoilers on everything. So without further ado, here are my opinions about ME3 (note: all the following spoilers are ME3 specific).

I have several complaints about this game. First, the way it tracks your progress for galactic readiness. I can't think of any good reason to keep it fixed at 50% from the very beginning to the very end of the single player campaign. At first I thought maybe this was the developers attempt at impressing upon us the idea that everything Shepard does is ultimately futile. But then I played a round of the multiplayer, and suddenly my progress shot up by 6% and that theory went out the window. This makes absolutely no sense to me. They put a big progress bar in your campaign, but it's only affected by online matches, and otherwise has pretty much no discernable impact on your campaign? Then why the hell is it there?? It just makes me feel completely impotent every time I look at it, and I played through the entire campaign before starting a multiplayer match so I know for a fact that this thing is completely useless to the actual story.

Second, I felt like everything I was doing was ultimately futile. I'm no stranger to doing the most inane things in a game purely to fulfill sidequests or get achievements for the sake of being a completionist. But I really felt like there was no point to doing any of the sidequests in ME3. Probably because no matter how many extra resources I gained my "galactic readiness" never budged. But perhaps also because this game felt like one huge, drawn-out ending to me. Because it's the final piece of the trilogy, everything is wrapping up and whittling down to one final conclusion, so it basically made all my choices pointless since I'd still end up in the same place. There was all this work but all the payoff was delayed until the very end, with the final choice of the game, and no individual choice before that really mattered - your outcome only changes after doing huge chunks of side missions. So why do I bother?

And that payoff was lousy. I know understand why so many people had a disliking for the ending to this game. Oh, guess what, Shepard? [No matter what you do, you're boned. Choice A: you die along with most of the galaxy. Choice B: you die so you can tell the reapers to fuck off. Choice C: you die so that your DNA can somehow be used to make everyone into cyborg ... things.] (/spoiler) Wow. Such a broad variety, how can I ever choose? It honestly felt like they were taking the heavily polarized moral system and applying that to your endings as well - you get your your renegade ending, your neutral ending, and your paragon ending. And none of those is really worth all the effort, if you ask me. Your only reward for hours of your life dedicated to this thing is [how many crew members will pop out of the Normandy in the final cut scene.] (/spoiler) There is so little difference between any of these endings that it makes me wonder why I didn't just play eenie-meenie-minie-mo to pick one.

Don't get me wrong, I love this series, and for the most part ME3 was a pretty solid game. But their management of the multiplayer features and the ending they seemed to pull out of the developer's asses really killed this last game for me. It felt like a major disruption in an otherwise interesting and seemingly well-thought out series.

All that said, what are some of your guys' thoughts? Did you enjoy the ending or no? What did you like or not like about ME3? I'm curious to find out! 
























 Um ... what? How is being a trans person okay, but being a cross dresser is too weird? I don't get it.

Whatever. I cross dress too, so I'd be totally into it! Sounds like a great time to me :D 




 I'm guessing I shouldn't click that link. 




 That is a really tough issue. In my current relationship everything works out because I'm not totally opposed to sex, and we're also poly so my partner is free to have sex with someone else if he wants. But we aren't married and don't have any kids, so I can't give you any perspective there.

What I can tell you is that you shouldn't feel horrible or that you're a freak. You can't help wanting to have sex with your wife - you're a sexual person, and I'm sure you love her very much. However, speaking from an asexual perspective, I probably understand your wife's situation better than I do yours. I sometimes feel guilty about the fact that my SO and I aren't entirely sexually compatible. I know that he wants to please me and share physical contact with me; that is a core part of a relationship for most people. Whenever we are intimate, I can tell that he wishes he could do more for me, but I'm just not that into sex. And then I feel bad because he feels bad, even though it's neither of our faults.

I think that's a key point here - this isn't anyone's fault. You can't help having desires, and she can't help not having them. Both of you are perfectly normal in this. But it is causing friction in your marriage, so it does have to be dealt with. If you've been married long enough that you have more than one child I assume you've probably been through a lot together, and you love each other and want to make each other happy. Start from there. Have a conversation about this with your wife. Remember that no one is the guilty party here, and have a frank discussion about your feelings. Be honest with each other. Once you figure out what each person wants and needs, you can work together to form a strategy to fix the issues you're having. This doesn't have to be a huge issue in your relationship, but it will only get worse if you don't communicate about it. 




 Exactly. This is something I've actually discussed at length in LGBTQ groups - all queer people struggle, but some gay activists try to claim that because there's no laws keeping asexual people from getting married (which of course ignores the fact that some aces have same-sex partners) and no one gets bullied for being asexual like they would for being gay or gets told they'll go to hell (neither of which are necessarily true either but it is true that it's probably not as common), aces shouldn't be considered part of the queer community. It's this mentality of "you're obviously not as openly oppressed as I am, therefore you don't matter."

Of course, not all people think that way. But ignorance like that is still a huge issue for us. Invisibility creates a whole different oppression dynamic. After all, if no one knows anything about you, then how can they possibly know your struggles or try to help you overcome them? I feel like being an ace activist, at least in my area, is first and foremost a struggle for people to recognize that I even exist. And that's pretty messed up. 




 Yeah, that can be tough. It's how life often works, though - you get unexpected reactions from people sometimes.

Whenever my roommate came out to his family, he thought that his dad's mother would be pretty understanding since she's relatively liberal, but was more afraid to come out to his mom's mother because that side of the family is more conservative. Turns out, dad's mom was really shitty about the whole thing and continues to tell nasty lies about him to the rest of the family, while his mom's mom has been his biggest advocate in the family and has actually gotten somewhat closer to him after he came out. There's really just no telling what will happen when you tell people about your identity. 




 I would say that you did. Who knows what could have happened if the situation had continued to escalate? The best thing you could possibly do is remove yourself from the situation, and in this case it was telling your stepdad to leave.

I can definitely relate to where you're coming from. I was abused as a kid, and just this past spring I had to testify in a court hearing over an issue that was completely blown out of proportion by my stepdad and younger brother. Family drama sucks, but it's especially miserable when your relationships are so incredibly toxic.

I'm glad you stood up for yourself and that your stepdad can no longer push you around. And I also understand why you feel bad for your little brother - I felt a lot of guilt for leaving behind my little sister whenever I finally escaped my family. She's twelve now, but she was only nine whenever I went away for college. I was always worried about what would happen to her without me there to protect her. But ultimately, you are your own person and you can only do so much. Your safety is the priority here, and I'm sure that if the argument between you and your stepdad continued it is very likely you or your husband or even your daughter could have gotten hurt. You protected them and yourself when you told him to leave.

Don't forget, though, that if you find out about anything bad happening to your younger brother, you can call child services. Most places have some sort of system where if they find out a child is being abused they can hold the parents accountable and remove the child from that situation. 




 One of the biggest problems with identifying as asexual is that so few people have even heard of it, let alone actually know anything about it. That's why so many of us go for most of our childhoods and even a large portion of our adult lives feeling that we're different but not really knowing why or how to explain it. I've seen people on the AVEN forums who are past their fifties and just now discovering the asexual label and community. That's a huge issue.

I can say it's definitely affected me personally, and I'm sure that others have had similar experiences. For one thing, I grew up thinking that I was a freak. I never had any crushes on anyone as a kid, but growing up as a little girl was tough because crushes and boyfriends are a primary discussion topic for girls from the time they're about eight or nine years old. I really struggled with feelings of loneliness and isolation for a long time, as well as my own frustrations that I should be fitting into the sexist notions of what it meant to be a young girl. I was constantly under pressure to worry about clothes, hair, makeup, boys ... and I hated every minute of it.

While I'm much more comfortable with myself and my identity now, I'm still usually the only openly asexual person that the people I know have ever come across. Coming out to people is so exhausting. On top of the concern that someone will reject you for being queer, you have the added pressure of explaining what your sexuality even means for the benefit of someone who has had absolutely no exposure to an entire group of people. It takes time, patience, effort, and it's a lot of pressure.

I feel like if there were at least one or two people in the public sphere that were well-known aces, in the way that there are now more and more celebrities or public officials coming out as gay or bisexual or even transgender, it would greatly ease the coming out process and other discussions around asexuality for the rest of us. Right now the conversations I have with people usually look like this:

 Me: I'm asexual.
 
 Friend: What's that?
 
 M: Basically I'm not physically attracted to other people, regardless of their sex or gender.
 
 Friend: ... That's a thing? I didn't think it was possible./How can you not want to have sex?/Are you sure you just don't have a hormone problem?/A lot of women are picky, that's okay. You'll feel differently once you find the right guy./Etc., etc.

Instead, the conversation could look like:

 M: I'm asexual.
 
 F: What's that?
 
 M: Basically I'm not physically attracted to other people, regardless of their sex or gender.
 
 F: Oh, I think I've heard of that before ... isn't [insert famous person] also asexual?

Considering how many people will deny the existence of ace-spectrum identities directly to your face after you just came out to them, having a few public roles models who are asexual would definitely help to ease some of that ignorance. 




 I've never been straight up told that I don't love my SO, but I have been told that if I did love him I should let him sexually assault me. There are some awful people out there that say stupid and ignorant things. All that really matters is that you and your girlfriend are happy, so I hope what they said doesn't get you too down. :/ 




 Really?? A gallifrey cross-stitch name would be awesome. I'm not even into DW really but I have friends who are and that is no small feat. How could anyone not like such a cool gift?? 




 I have at least 6 or 7 halfway-done projects right now ... every time I look at them I feel a little guilty but I just never feel like working on them, haha. 




 You're not the only one, haha. I'm panromantic so I'm certainly not limited to male partners, but a lot of people see me with my boyfriend and just assume. 

Yeah, AAW is pretty similar to pride month - same basic idea. It's a week where the community activists try extra hard to promote awareness of asexuality as well as demisexuality and grey-area asexuality too.  




 I don't mind at all!

I don't usually tell people right off the bat when I meet them or anything. However, whenever I'm talking to people and discussing relationship stuff (which happens pretty frequently when socializing with people), I'll bring it up occasionally. This is usually how I come out to friends - just bring it up casually as part of a general discussion. I've been lucky because most of my friends were pretty accepting of it after I explained it to them, and now I can talk with them freely about this sort of thing.

It doesn't really come up that often, though, so for a long time only a few close friends knew about my identity. So as part of Asexuality Awareness Week (which was back in October) I decided to come out on facebook. That went pretty well too, because I could just link people to stuff and they didn't have to ask me a million questions - they could go find out about it themselves. Quite a few people told me they were glad they learned something new, and a friend of mine from back in high school messaged me saying that she was also asexual and had been too afraid to tell anyone because she had a bad coming-out experience once with another friend. It made me pretty happy that we had something in common like that, and the stuff I posted gave her hope about her own future.

Since then, though, I've still been following the same method of waiting until it will be more relevant in a discussion about relationships. Also, I've had to correct people a few times whenever they assume I'm straight because I'm dating a guy, and that usually leads to discussion as well. 




 I do the same thing. I usually like to knit or crochet in my free time between classes or while listening to lectures, so I'll get 20-45 min. here and there. So a project that might take two weeks if I worked on it like a part-time job schedule ends up taking two months. 




 heterosexual romantic asexual

I think the term you're looking for is heteroromantic. And like I said in my other comment, such a relationship is possible, although difficult. If you aren't comfortable having sex at all, that does unfortunately narrow your choices. But it will probably help in the future if you discuss your identity with any future partners. That way you can both work out what you're comfortable with. Some partners are willing to forgo sex, other times (like in my case) you can have sex occasionally but not so often that you feel too pressured. Also, a lot of people (myself included) have poly relationships where their partner is allowed to have sex with other people. That solves the problem of not wanting to have sex on your end, but also your partner's issue of being able to satisfy their physical needs. This isn't for everyone, however, so you just need to think about what you want and are comfortable doing. 




 Fellow asexual person here!!

First off, I'm glad that you've figured out your identity and you're starting to feel more comfortable with yourself. Unlike a lot of other GRSM groups, being asexual is hard because there is so little known about it. Many people go for long periods without understanding such an important part of themselves because they don't even know that it's possible, or they don't have a word that describes who they are. Everyone knows what it means to be gay, but very few people understand asexuality.

It's totally normal for you to feel a little weird about this realization. Asexuality totally flies in the face of most people's conceptualization of sexuality, romance, and relationships. So it's understandable if you have some concerns!

As far as finding a partner, don't worry - it's not impossible. Fortunately, more and more people in the queer community are becoming aware of asexuality, and it's starting to come into public awareness as well. For a movement that only started in the '90s, asexuality awareness has come a long way.

That said, the chances of you finding another asexual partner are relatively low. But there are a lot of sexual people who are find with having an asexual partner. I'm currently dating a straight guy, and he's very accommodating about my identity. The important thing to remember is that open, honest communication is absolutely key - both of you need to communicate your needs and make sure that there is no pressure or resentment when it comes to the physical aspect of your relationship.

As far as coming out to friends and family, I will tell you right now that it will be hard. Again, pretty much everyone knows what it means when you say "I'm gay" or "I'm bi" but not "I'm asexual." You will likely have to explain your sexuality dozens of times to various people, and they will most likely have lots of questions. It's good that you've been looking through a lot of research on the subject already - this means that you can use those same resources when communicating your identity to other people. The AVEN FAQs are pretty handy. Also, I highly recommend [this Huff Post series](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/17/asexuality-the-x-in-a-sexual-world_n_3444417.html?1371476630 utm_hp_ref=fb src=sp comm_ref=false) about asexuality - it covers a lot of things that the FAQs don't.

Whether or not you do decide to come out, I wish you luck. Just know that no matter what happens, you're not alone, and the rest of the community is here to support you! Feel free to message me anytime. : 




 True. A lot of people don't understand the value of hand-made items. I didn't really have a materials cost since I used leftover yarn that I already had, but if I were to calculate how much it would cost by how many hours of work I put into it, that scarf would get expensive fast. 




 I realize, I just thought it was worth saying - like, this is the exception. The point is put some effort forth, right?

Also, thanks! Crafting talents certainly open up a lot of gifting options. 




 I mostly agree. Although it would be nice for personalized wrapping and notes, it's also difficult if you're buying gifts online. I'd say in that case that people should maybe send a card as well as a gift, or even a message on reddit if you're really strapped for cash. Just let your giftee know that you put thought into your gift and you care about them.

Also, I didn't spend $20 on my gift. I actually spent less than $10. But in addition to the things that I bought, I also added a hand-crocheted scarf especially tailored for my giftee's interests. So even though I couldn't spend a whole lot of money I still put a lot of effort into my gift, and I hope they appreciated it. Not everyone has a lot of money, but finding something special or making a gift should still be an option, I think. 




 There's a lot of people on the internet lately who've been diagnosing themselves or their friends with just about anything they can google. I've seen it a lot on tumblr especially.

Also, it's been more and more common in the media lately - a lot of characters on popular TV shows depict some version of mental illness. Sheldon Cooper (Big Bang Theory), Dr. Brennan (Bones), Sherlock Holmes (BBC Sherlock), Sugar Motta (Glee), etc. Of course, not all of them are entirely accurate and a lot of fans misinterpret symptoms (because not just anyone can pick up the DSM and diagnose, that's why people get degrees for it). This of course leads to further trendiness and also complete misunderstanding of how mental illness works and impacts people's lives. 




 Exactly. People who flippantly say things like "oh I'm so OCD" for wanting to be neat or "I was so depressed" about something relatively minor make it that much harder for people with actual mental issues to be understood.

OCD isn't wanting to stay organized, it's not being able to control your thoughts and being so obsessed with things you know are completely irrational but still have them to the point where it's debilitating. Depression is barely being able to muster the energy to get out of bed and go to the bathroom or find something to eat - you know, basic biological functions - because you feel absolutely no desire to do anything. You just sit there, being numb and completely unproductive, and you don't even know why, but the deeper your depression goes the more you feel like shit for being a burden on other people. These things are not fun, or minor. They quite literally take over your life.

The other one that really gets me is how autism has now made it into public awareness so anyone who's even slightly socially awkward says they have Asperger's. Being awkward does not mean you have fucking Asperger's. My brother has that. I challenge anyone who tries to claim they do to live with him for one week and then see how they feel about it afterward. Autism is not a joke. 




 People who try to claim they have a mental illness because it's trendy can fuck off straight to another universe. Anyone who does it is a shitty excuse for a human being. I share your frustration, OP - and if I were you I would not keep this "friend" around much longer. 




 I don't particularly care, as long as it doesn't start to get super crazy long because then it's harder to keep clean and you have the awful occurrence of getting hairs in your mouth during oral ... ugh. 




 I agree with Diogenes. If you're comfortable, come out to your friend and then take it from there. The easiest way to find out if he's interested is to just straight up ask. I wish you good luck, and I hope the two of you are happy : 




 My best friend is into Terry Pratchett, the only thing I've read by them is Good Omens. I'll have to ask her if I can borrow some of the Discworld books. 




 I hate when people complain about others "shaming" them for doing stupid, harmful things. If you're doing something wrong and someone points it out, that's not shaming you, it's correcting you. Ugh. 




 I never flush tampons. There are some tampons that have flushable *applicators*, but that's totally different than flushing the actual tampon. I have never seen tampons that are flushable.

Also, pretty much from the time I started having periods it's been pounded into my brain that YOU DO NO FLUSH tampons, or any feminine hygiene products, because they will clog your pipes. If your gf seriously thinks that wrapping them in tp and throwing them away isn't possible or it will make the bathroom "stinky" she's full of shit. I've done that my whole life, never had any issues. And I've lived with up to three other women at a time who also have periods. For women and no stink? Pretty sure that means it's okay. As long as you take out the trash regularly it doesn't matter. It's no stinkier than kitchen garbage - old food is way stinkier than tampons. 




 You look so great! I'm glad you were able to afford the trip and the surgery. It can do so much to improve your life :D 




 I don't care, honestly. I would be totally happy if they were friends or if they got together. But yeah, the bear feels fjdkls 




 Exactly. How often do you read a medieval fantasy book that not only has just as many important female characters as male characters, but has women who aren't super-beautiful-elf/princess/elf princess types? Pretty much never. Except for ASoIaF. So much love for GRRM. 




 FemShep is best Shep. Seriously, she has much better voice acting. It's so sad that she's been completely ignored by all the PR material for the Mass Effect series. 




 Brienne of Tarth and Daenerys Targaryen from A Song of Ice and Fire. All of the female characters in that series are really well written and varied, which is awesome, but these two are my favorites. Throughout the books you watch Dany go from being a frightened young girl who is abused by her older brother to a young woman capable of toppling cities with her armies and leading thousands of people. It's really interesting to watch her grow and struggle with love and the responsibilities of leadership. I love Brienne because I relate to her more than probably any other character in the series - she is a woman who is not conventionally attractive and prefers armor and swords to dresses and embroidery needles. Her struggles with the men surrounding her, threats of rape, teasing, disrespect, and constantly being underestimated and worrying about being a "freak," are all so real to me.

There are lots of others but those are the first two that popped into my head because I'm currently reading A Dance with Dragons. 




 Yes. It's stupid. Your feelings are your feelings, and implying that someone is moody because they're female is just a way to undermine someone's feelings. You're basically saying that "you have a vagina, your feelings don't matter." It's really sad when women say this too, because it's just internalized misogyny.

In the same vein, I hate whenever I (or another female) is angry or upset about something and some douchebag says it must be because I'm on my period. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize that I was only allowed to be angry about things while bleeding from my vagina and all the rest of the time I should be happy and perky constantly. 




 Speaking as someone else who's been through a similar experience, I realize how huge it can be to forgive someone, especially someone that has repeatedly done so many awful things to you.

I think what really made me come to the point that you have now was mostly practicality. After years and years of holding on to the anger, the hatred, the resentment, I realized that none of that really mattered. That the person I was holding all these negative feelings in for had no idea. They hadn't seen me in years; what did it matter to them whether I hated them or not? Either way, it would have absolutely no impact on their life.

I let it go. I finally figured out that I was just wasting all this time and effort and emotion for someone who didn't give a flying fuck about me, so why should I care about them? Not that I'll necessarily be overflowing with love and adoration for any of the people who have irreversibly fucked up my life, but at the end of the day *they just aren't worth the effort of hating.* That's really all there is to it.

So I forgave them and moved on. 




 Wow. I can't imagine how stressed out you and your boyfriend have been throughout this whole ordeal. It's always scary whenever you or a loved one has to deal with serious illness.

For what it's worth, I sincerely hope that you aren't positive and that your boyfriend is healthy as well. If not, then I just want you to know that there are lots of nice people on the internet who wish you well and will be here to listen, if you need it.

Much love and I hope that you and your boyfriend can be happy together, regardless of what happens. : 




 I would say that if your friend was already seriously pursuing this guy, it would be a good idea to back off. However, to me it seems like she's being pretty immature about it. Yeah, it sucks when one of your friends ends up dating your crush. But it's not like she owns him or anything. He is free to date anyone he pleases, as are you.

Regardless of whether or not your friend gets mad, I would say that you should definitely pursue this guy. You seem to have hit it off really well and if you're both interested, why not?

Obviously if you do end up together you shouldn't rub it in your friend's face or anything, but if she starts being snippy again or tries to raise a fuss over it just remind her that if she wanted to date him she easily could have asked him out herself. That's on her, not you. 




 *Extra awesome hugs*

I hope you had a great day too! And everyone else here. You guys are all awesome. Happy holidays, and I hope everybody has a wonderful new year! 




 I wasn't sure if it would accept it if the form wasn't all filled out. But I'll go ahead and do that, thanks! 




 So I've been tracking my secret santa package, and it came yesterday. Just called my roommate to confirm (since our mail sometimes gets stolen, I live in a sketchy building). I'm so happy and excited that my gift got to my house safely!!

The problem? I'm not at my house. I'm visiting relatives for the holidays. Relatives that live an hour and a half away. And I won't be home until well after New Year's.

 Yeah, you could accidentally end up looking like a huge ass. 




 I've been in similar situations too. I'm trying to chat with someone and then suddenly other people assume I'm flirting with them or we like each other. I guess that sort of thing is really subjective. 




 What is it about them that you find cute? Mostly physical features, or is it more about who they are as a person?

I dunno, maybe you could go with gray-a. 




 I don't blame you. It was pretty bad. That scene was certainly not for the squeamish. 









 Gotcha. I will definitely get them as soon as possible, even if I can't read them before ADWD. 




 Yes, biology can influence gender. No, it is not the only factor. And most of the division of labor has nothing to do with biology.

I'm not talking about transexuals, I'm talking about trans* people. Many of them would be much more offended by you using such an outdated and heavy-loaded word. And once again, you completely misunderstand how gender works. People who are transgender that experience gender dysphoria aren't the only ones involved here. There are also people who are genderqueer, genderfluid, third gender, agender, etc. All of the people who lie outside the gender binary fit into this idea. Many queer people realize that the way most of Western society is arranged with "male" and "female" as the only two categories is a gender construct, and they do not identify with this construct.

Also, it should be brought up that a lot of evolutionary theory in regards to sex in humans is biased and used to justify sexism. And I'm not even going to touch your last paragraph. 




 You know I'd completely forgotten about it, but Cat certainly follows her family's words quite well. 




  you are trying to spoil r/asoiaf by bringing radical sexology theory into it

I don't believe I'm spoiling anything. There is no reason that we can't apply critical thinking to the books we read and have meta-discussions about them rather than purely discussing the books' events and characters in regards to future plot development.

Also, I'm well aware of the David Riemer case. I study psychology. His unfortunate circumstances are often brought up in discussions about gender or childhood development. What John Money and Reimer's parents did to him was inexcusable.

 the theorist who came up with the idea that gender is a social construct, was proved wrong by his own empirical investigations and caused the depression and ultimate death of the boy he 'treated'

Actually, David's case doesn't prove that the idea of gender as a social construct is wrong. Assuming that this is the case completely ignores the existence of people who are trans*. Not to mention that it shows how you have a complete misunderstanding of how gender constructs work.

As far as biological sex goes, with the human species there is mainly male (xy) and female (xx), as well as many intersex people who have dozens of other chromosomal combinations. Sex is determined by genetics, and influences physical characteristics such as the development of genitals, and secondary characteristis like breasts or hair growth.

Gender, on the other hand, is the way in which people in a given society perceive sex and determine roles for its members based on those perceptions.

In other words, sex would be "this person has two x chromosomes, therefore they are female" while gender is "this person is female, therefore they have to wear these clothes and hold these jobs." Gender has no real biological basis; for instance, there is nothing in our DNA that determines men should wear pants while women should wear skirts or dresses. That is a gender construct.

This applies to Brienne, because she doesn't fit into the gender role society has prescribed for her - according to Westerosi society, she should be wearing dresses, getting married, and having children as part of the female gender role. Instead, she chose to take on a male role; she dresses in armor, has trained with weapons, and acts as a knight.

But your sorts try to convert everyone.

I don't know what you mean by "your sorts," but I'm not trying to convert anyone here, just have a discussion about what I see as a really well written character in a great book. You are the only person who is bothered by this. 




 I always thought that Cat was compelling because while she is a noble lady she is also a mother, and sometimes she puts her motherly duties before her duties as a lady. That's really what results in a lot of her rash, less well-thought out decisions; she just wants to protect her children, regardless of how it might affect politics. 




 Well I own the main five but not the other books, so I don't know how feasible that is. 




 I was wondering about all the other characters to, then partway through reading it one of my friends told me that AFFC and ADWD was originally one book and he decided to split it by characters rather than chronologically. It made sense to me, so it didn't really bother me. 




 To be fair, Brienne had to search a whole kingdom for one girl in the middle of a war. Of course it wasn't that likely that she was in the ruins, but she had to chase down the lead just in case. After all, what if it *had* been Sansa and Brienne had thought, "no that's not likely I won't even try." She had to take even the slightest chance just in case. After all, as far as Brienne knew Sansa hadn't been abducted, and even if she did know that it didn't necessarily mean she was taken to the Eyrie. After all, why would her aunt (who wants to stay out of the war) abduct her, rather than someone who wanted to use her for political gain? It just so happened that the person who did abduct her happened to go to where her aunt is. Don't mistake the fact that just because YOU as the reader know a lot doesn't mean that the characters do. It's called dramatic irony. 




 It was in Brienne VII, if I count correctly. After she and Podrick and the others got to the inn where Gendry and all the orphans were staying, Brienne went to go take Gendry some supper out in the forge. Then Biter and the outlaw wearing Clegane's helm show up, and start threatening Willow and the other orphans, so Brienne challenged them. The new "Hound" charged at her and she killed him, and that's when Biter attacked. 




 Same! The whole time I was reading the attack scene I was mentally screaming "OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD." I actually physically flinched more than once. 




 Exactly. He doesn't just show a bunch of awesome warrior ladies. He shows women who are forced to play a certain role in society because of their birth, which is really important, because not every woman can go off and be a knight. 




 Um ... yes, it is. 




 Well, there are plenty of asexual people who masturbate, or even watch porn. And not all ace people hate sex, either.

The key, though, is the attraction - asexual people aren't physically attracted to other people. So if you find people physically attractive, you probably aren't asexual. However, aces can still experience romantic attraction. So if you are attracted to someone's personality but not their body that would still apply.

That said, no one can really decide what your identity should be but you. I hope this all helps you figure stuff out, let me know if you have any other questions : 




 Well I downloaded the main ones as a set, but I haven't had the money for the other ones. :/ 




 Same. 




 I suppose that's understandable. But honestly, I don't feel like everything each character does necessarily has to have a huge impact on the entire country. I mean, a lot of the stuff that happened with Sam doesn't really have a huge impact on the main plot, either.

And sure, we know that Brienne wasn't anywhere close to Sansa. But while searching we were also able to check up on some of the other characters we hadn't seen in a while - the Brotherhood, Catelyn Stark, Gendry, Podrick, etc. 




 But would you honestly want to read pages of dialogue saying the same things you had just spent chapters reading? I would say that unless Martin had something else that was new to add, or could somehow use Brienne's dialogue to put new perspective on the events, there is no reason to watch it all happen to her and then also hear her tell someone else about it at length. 




 Ah, ok. 




 Long car trip? Yep, that would do it. I've been trying to read this book while also studying and writing papers for finals, so I was pretty much doomed to be interrupted. 




 I've definitely wanted to check them out, I was just trying to finish the main five books first. 




 Fair enough. Personally, the kingsmoot was my least favorite part of the book. I have absolutely no emotional investment in any of the Ironmen; I really could care less about their politics or who leads them. However, it will be interesting to see where Euron takes them... 




 I've been picking up the series whenever I have time to read, so this book has taken me about two weeks since I haven't read every day. But it definitely went really fast for me compared to the other books. I'm not sure if that's because it's shorter - I'm reading the ebook versions on my Kindle so I really have no concept of how physically long these books are. 




 I get where you're coming from, but I have to say I disagree. By the time Brienne tells him her story, we've already read through it. If Martin had decided to repeat the whole thing by having Brienne verbally recite it, it probably would have become tedious. Instead he just sums it up nicely for us. 




 I'm confused ... 




 Agreed, it was really cool to see all those women compared side by side and the differences (and similarities) in how they lead their lives.

I think the only part of the book I didn't like was probably the Kingsmoot with the Ironmen. That part was necessary, although relatively boring compared to the rest of the book. 




 I feel you there. Every time I hit another one of Cersei's chapters I was like "ugghhhh gotta get this over with." Not that the scenes aren't written well or important character development-wise, but she is just so unlikeable at this point in the story. I'm so glad that Jaime threw her message into the fire. 




 Biter took at least two big chunks out of one cheek as well as her ear, and from the description of the wounds that Thoros gave she would definitely have significant scarring. 




 It was certainly interesting to see a more realistic and lesser-taken approach to the knight's quest to save a fair maid story. I also appreciate that by showing Brienne's POV, Martin manages to fairly adequately show a lot of the issues that women who break the mold go through. It isn't easy being in Brienne's shoes. I can certainly relate to her character, and I hope that even if she does die tragically she at least gets a little justice before she goes. 




 Well I know I definitely enjoyed it the first time around, no matter what other people seem to think of it. It was really fun seeing how certain characters thought and felt that weren't given a lot of POV parts before, as well as giving more/new perspective for characters that we've already seen a lot of. This is the book that really cemented my liking Jaime Lannister. It might not have huge battles or massive plots but imho it had just as many emotionally charged scenes that really gave you a connection to the characters. And what's the point of having epic battles if you don't care about any of the participants? Why should I care who comes into power if I don't have any investment in the people I'm reading about? If you ask me, without those sorts of scenes the action-packed bits would be a lot less meaningful or exciting.

Oh, and I'm definitely looking forward to finishing the series so that I can finally start looking into all the conspiracy theories and whatnot. And then I'll read them all again and look for prophecies and foreshadowing. It will be a lot of fun! 




 Really? I thought they were interesting. I mean, sure, there are some slower parts as far as action and intrigue go but they were really important for character development, so they certainly weren't just filling up space ... 




 Okay, so I just finished the fourth book this morning. I gotta say, there were a lot of interesting events in this one, but the parts that got to me the most were Brienne's chapters. Hearing more of her backstory and finding out the details of all her failed betrothals and the treatment she got from the other soldiers she was stationed with was a bit of a tearjerker. Not to mention that every time she spoke to Tarly I wanted to reach through the pages into the world of Westeros and punch that guy in the face.

As infuriating as it was to read about all the shit Brienne goes through, at the same time I'm glad that Martin wrote the scenes the way he did. Some people (who haven't really read the whole series, or at least not closely) criticized him for making a series so brutally violent, and especially so for the incredible amount of violence against women. But after reading Brienne's story, I believe that Martin knows what he's doing. How he depicts Brienne and other characters' reactions to her is a rather good depiction of how gender roles are constructed, defied, and the consequences of such.

I, for one, hope that Martin continues to write his characters so well. 




 The only one I can think of is Lonely Yuri. It's mostly just really cute fluff, no actual sex on screen. 




 I agree, it's really stupid to shame girls for liking "girl stuff." I really liked the Avengers, because I'm a total comic book geek, but I also think that Love Actually is an incredibly heart-warming and cleverly written film (and one of the few romantic movies I genuinely enjoy). You shouldn't be made to feel small or lesser because you prefer romance to action. It's just a preference. 




 I applaud you, sir, for realizing the truth and being willing to speak up about it. 




 Nope. It's just a pillow - it measures 16". Just big enough to rest your head. Although you aren't the only person who wants a bean bag Snorlax, apparently. 




 Well, the yarn and the pillow cost just under $20, so not that expensive materials-wise, but it did take me the better part of a week to finish. I put at least 40 hours into it. 




 No, it happened when I was still a minor. Something like this would be ideal, but I live in the U.S. so unfortunately it doesn't help me much. Thanks, though! 




 Ok. I'll definitely post a comment here about it, and I'll try to message anyone who specifically asks so you won't miss it : 




 The easiest way would be to just use a smaller hook and a much thinner yarn. Modifying the pattern would probably take way too long. I think sports weight would probably do it. 




 Well I'm thinking about writing up the pattern, when I do I'll let you know. 




 Possible? Yes. Likely? Not really. At least, not if it was crocheted. That would take forever. Now if I was sewing it would be a whole lot easier. 




 Aw, man. Now I can't unsee it either. 




 No problem! I hope you find it as useful as I did. 




 Here's the link to [my shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Knitin8bit) if you're interested. 




 I tried to make a very happy Snorlax. After all, no one wants a sad Snorlax. 




 Hello, all! I would like to promote my shop, Knitin8bit. I just started a few months ago and haven't been doing much because of school, but I hope that it will pick up soon as I have a few things I plan on posting over my winter break!

I'm really into video games, so a lot of what I make is video-game related. Lately I've been creating items that are references to Legend of Zelda, Animal Crossing, Mario, PacMan, Pokemon, and others. I also make some anime-related items. Generally, anything nerdy is something I can get behind! I try to make things that aren't just plushies (although plushies are lovely), but also things that have some practical purpose while showing off your favorite games. For example, I've made gloves, scarves, hats, pillows, tote bags, and dice pouches in the past.

Here's the link to my [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Knitin8bit), I have a few items on sale at the moment. It's currently a mix of knitting, crochet, and a little beading.

Also, here's a link to my [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Knitin8bit?ref=stream) where I post updates occasionally about things I am working on or pictures of some of my creations that are given as gifts (and therefore aren't in my shop).

Even if I don't make any sales, I would still like some feedback from people about what they think of my products. Ideas on other things I could make are also welcome. Thanks everyone! 




 Yeah, I have that sometimes, I just pick it off and go on with my day. 




 I made this using a 16" pillow form and some worsted weight yarn. For the body of the pillow I just crocheted a circle and made increases and decreases as necessary to fit the pillow shape. For the legs, arms, and head I free-handed all of it. It's super soft and comfy, and I got a yarn that's machine washable and dryable so it's pretty kid-friendly too. If you guys have any questions I'd love to answer them!

Edit: Wow! So many people want patterns. Okay, I will definitely be writing that out later tonight or tomorrow, whenever I have time. I'll probably charge for the pattern, though - does $5 sound fair? 














 I really want to make a hood that will keep my face warm in this awful winter weather. Will be making up my own design to look like the [traveler from Journey](http://cdnl.complex.com/mp/620/400/80/0/bb/1/ffffff/4a9b343e63fcfd6377ab5bad41b450ae/images_/assets/CHANNEL_IMAGES/VIDEO_GAMES/2013/02/journey_by_warrand4t9abc.jpg). 




 While some fans of any given franchise might be annoying (as someone who is a frequent con-goer for anime related things, believe me, you have no idea how bad it can get unless you've done it too), you really shouldn't worry about other people "ruining" the fandom or how people from outside the fandom view you because of them.

Yes, there are a lot of things that have gotten hugely popular but the behavior of some people in the fan base has driven others away (Homestuck, Hetalia, SuperWhoLock, etc.) and this is certainly a problem. However, if it really bothers you that much the best advice I can give you is just don't associate with those people and like whatever the hell you want to like. You shouldn't be afraid of judgement of others for being a fan of something.

Also, as a side note, I've never had anyone look at me like a Brony for liking Hannibal. Probably because it's a show about serial killers, so I'm definitely within the target demographic, unlike MLP where a lot of the fans are decidedly too old to be within the target audience. Even then, though, I'm not gonna judge unless you're one of those Bronies that buys sex toy versions of the plushies because holy shit why. 




 If you're really worried that asking him will make you seem like you're being really nosy or that he might take it the wrong way or something, there aren't a whole lot of other options. Of course asking him yourself would be the most straight-forward route. But perhaps you can have one of your mutual friends ask on your behalf? That way if it turns out he's straight you won't have to deal with the fallout of "Oh, wait, you're into me?? No, I don't swing that way." 




 Maybe just a little. 




 [Here you go](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/17/asexuality-the-x-in-a-sexual-world_n_3444417.html?1371476630 utm_hp_ref=fb src=sp comm_ref=false) :) 




 Sexual assault is defined differently. Check the link. 




 I second this. 




 Actually, [assault](http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/sexassault.htm). 




 Unfortunately, there is somewhat of a double standard here. What you're describing is sexual assault. Sexual assault is not okay, and no one should have to suffer it, so of course you have a right to be angry. Someone touched you in a way you didn't consent to. That's not cool.

Unfortunately, while women face a lot of sexual assault because of sexism, whenever men go through it the same sexism comes back to haunt them. According to patriarchal thought, women are weak and should be sexually available for men's pleasure. So of course women get assaulted by men a lot, and when it happens it is largely ignored. But if a woman does it to a man, it's assumed that the guy should want it - because men always want sex, right? And even if they didn't, how could a weaker woman force a guy to do anything he didn't want to do?

This is one of those cases in which fighting sexism definitely benefits men as much as women. You might get a lot of shit if you complain about this sort of thing, but I hope that you won't let it stop you from doing it.

In the future, whenever a woman does this, you should call her out on it right then and there. Say "whoa, why are you touching me?" Tell her that's not okay. Because it isn't. And not doing anything when it happens reinforces the idea that sexual assault is no big deal, or that unless someone does something that leaves you in the hospital it isn't REALLY sexual assault. This is definitely a problem, so don't be afraid to stand up for yourself! 




 Depressed? Perhaps not. Personality disorder? More likely. 




 I don't think that wanting to get this guy out of your lives is partriarchal. It's wanting to get rid of someone who is increasingly becoming a source of stress, frustration, hurt feelings, and emotionally manipulative behavior. I'm not sure that straight up banning him is a good idea, because your wife seems to be a bit starry-eyed about the guy and might rebel against it just as a knee-jerk reflex. However, I would definitely suggest that you talk to your wife about this. Holding in your feelings isn't helping anybody.

You should tell your wife how you feel. Don't be pushy or judgemental about it. Just tell her that you think this guy isn't that great for her. Explain to her calmly why. Tell her that if your positions were reversed you would want her to tell you that you were in a bad situation. Tell her that you're concerned and you can't deal with how the emotional turmoil in her relationship with this other guy is affecting your marriage. Great sex is fine, but it's not worth wrecking your other relationships.

I hope that you can help your wife see that this dude is just toying with her. We've all been in situations like that, where someone pulls the wool over our eyes. But this guy is not healthy for her, or for you. 




 I wouldn't mind if they said hi or waved to them, maybe exchanged a few pleasantries to be polite, but if we're on a date you should be focusing on me, not someone you're no longer dating. Say hi and move on. 




 Honestly, though, even if someone was doing self-harm to get attention I don't think they necessarily need to be bashed for that either. If they are that desperate for attention that they feel the need to cut themselves, they're obviously a little fucked up and they need to seek help from a therapist or something. 
























 Exactly. It's damned if you do, damned if you don't. Regardless of how you look apparently your eating habits are everybody else's business. I don't get it. 




 I love that video. It's amazing how many people don't get the fact that doing shit like that is offensive until you do it to them. 




 Because asexual people never ever have relationships with anyone ever. /s 




 But there is a difference between finding humor in something you do yourself and someone else making fun of you for having a bodily function that requires ovaries. It's about context. To put it another way, in The Michael J. Fox Show, MJF makes several jokes about his own experiences with Parkinson's, and they are pretty funny. Using humor as a coping mechanism is totally valid, and often hilarious. But if someone else randomly came up to him and said something like "Look at that guy! He keeps twitching like a weirdo, what a cripple! LOLOLOL" you probably wouldn't think this person was funny, you'd call them an asshole. It's not so much the fact that the guy in my story was mentioning periods in a joke that bothered me, but the fact that he was doing it in an incredibly insensitive way. 




 Alright. I'll have to adjust my design then, to make sure there is enough fabric left over to wrap around the rods on either end. Thanks! 




 I recently took up cross stitch, and I plan on making a rather large video game-themed project soon. Rather than frame the completed cross stitch (as per usual with these sorts of things) I would like to make it into a wall scroll. I was wondering if it would be feasible to get some wooden rods and cut them in half, then tuck the fabric inside and glue them back together. Alternatively, I could always just wrap the fabric around the rods and sew it, but I don't know if it will look as neat or be as durable.

What do you guys think? I have rather limited experience with gluing wood, none when it involves fabric. What would be the best way to go about this project? 




 Actually, I would argue that the motion control feature is only marketable if it is mandatory for the console. If you look at the long history of motion control (it goes all the way back to the Atari), it's never done well before the Wii came along. Why? Because motion control was seen as a luxury, an optional accessory. Not that many people are willing to pay the extra money for something like that. This is reinforced by the Kinect and PS motion controls that came out after the Wii. They didn't sell as well, even though the Wii proved that there was a market for motion control, because they were optional accessories that (for most people) didn't add enough to their overall gaming experience with those consoles to be worth the extra money.  




 Honestly I haven't seen the movie, but from what I've been told by people who have it was meant to be seen as ridiculous in the movie. But most of the people who quote it to me in real life are taking it out of context and basically are just using it as a straight-up "LOL GIRLZ HAVE PERIODS LOL PMS LOL" kind of thing. 




 Yes, humor is subjective. But making period jokes is still sexist bullshit. Laughing at women because they menstruate might be "funny" to some people but that doesn't make them less of a douche. 




 In my head-voice I was reading in they were screeching. But to be fair that is merely my imagination and not necessarily an accurate description. 




 I would say no, loving problematic things isn't inherently bad, especially if you are aware of their problematic aspects. Media is made by human beings, and human beings aren't perfect, and often our media reflects the imperfections in our society. But if you had to entirely forgo ANYTHING that had problematic aspects to it, you wouldn't be able to enjoy like 99% of things.

For instance, I love to play video games. I own something like 30 PS3 games, for example. And if I separated them into stacks based on if they had problematic aspects, were neutral, or were really positive for oppressed peoples, those stacks would go from "pretty large" to "we've got a handful here" to "one or two, maybe?"

Does this mean I shouldn't play video games? Of course not. For one thing, you can't criticize something fully until you've actually experienced it. I couldn't very well say that video games are sexist if I never played video games. Also, the more and more women play games and get involved in their development, the more that culture of sexism (and other issues like racism, homophobia, etc.) changes.

So yeah, you can totally enjoy problematic media. Because life isn't about black and white, you absolutely hate it or absolutely love it kind of feelings. It's about ranges and complexity. Of course you're allowed to like movies or tv shows or games that are pretty sexist, but isn't it also true that you get super excited by a movie or show or game that is incredibly positive? For example, I really like Lord of the Rings and I've seen both the Hobbit movies so far. I recognize all the wonderful work that Tolkien put into the series, as well as the efforts of the actors and director and all the production staff for the movies. But when I got into Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire, that became my new favorite medieval fantasy series. Why? Because unlike LotR, GoT acknowledges things like sexism, ableism, and other societal problems and actually gives a pretty diverse range of characters and perspectives.

So don't feel like you're a bad woman or feminist for liking Casablanca. Just as long as you know that it has problems and you're willing to work for a future where we have better media to choose from. 




 No problem :  




 Exactly. The doctor clearly made a mistake, but I fail to see how this is somehow because of some huge trans invasion or some other bull.

Not to mention that trans people constantly have issues with doctors not wanting to recognize their identity - I imagine that most transmen have times where doctors assume they must be a butch lesbian because they wear men's clothes. The butch woman being mistaken for a transman would be the other side of that coin, I suppose. Either way it's still wrong, but there is no need to go around screeching about how trans people and lesbians who date trans women are ruining the butch lesbian identity. :/ 




 Ugh. More trans-exclusionary vitriol.

I totally understand why this woman and her friend that the post was about would be angry that the friend in question was assumed to be trans whenever she was a butch lesbian. That is definitely wrong, and the doctor clearly made a mistake which I believe anyone would be offended about.

However, to read her follow-up response and all of the comments about how trans people are somehow a huge threat to butch lesbian existence ... it honestly made me really sad. Drawing arbitrary gender lines based on physical traits is not going to help us topple the patriarchy. People should be allowed to be who they want to be, regardless of their sexual identity, gender identity, or gender performance. Demonizing trans people only creates more problems for everyone. 




 Probably super random, but it really irks me whenever people quote that Anchorman line about how bears can smell menstruation. Pretty much every time this has happened near me it was some douchebro who thought it was just hilarious that he's making a period joke. The most recent time it happened I actually called the guy on it. He did the quote, a few other guys nearby gave a half-hearted chuckle, and I just straight-faced said to him, "That's not funny."

He tried to make some excuse about how humor is subjective and just because I didn't like the joke didn't mean it wasn't funny. I wasn't about to take that, so I replied "When have you EVER known a woman to laugh at that joke?" That shut him up pretty quick. 




 Good! I hope everything goes well with you, too :D 




 Sounds like you're asexual to me. Being in a relationship with someone or occasionally having sex doesn't disqualify you or anything. And honestly, a lot of queer people have issues with depression/bipolar/anxiety, doesn't make you any less queer. 




 I think it is definitely possible, although it depends on the relationship and what you and your partner do to make it work. My SO and I started dating when we were both 16, and we didn't have sex until we were college freshman at 18. We still have sex fairly regularly, although probably not as often as other couples. I'm pretty neutral toward sex, so I don't mind doing it with him because I see it as just another activity we do as a couple, like going on a dinner date. I enjoy it because I'm doing something with him, although obviously since I'm asexual I don't really get much out of it physically. But we're also in an open relationship so he is able to fulfill his sexual needs with other people as well.

I think the key thing to having a lasting relationship as an adult is that you and your partner communicate openly and frequently and have a lot of trust and understanding for each other. Considering the fact that asexual people are a pretty small minority compared to sexual people, it might be hard to find a partner who is willing to have the sort of relationship you're describing, and even then it will be tough to keep the relationship going. I would suggest talking to your boyfriend about it and seeing what he thinks. Honestly, it's not unrealistic to expect that the person you love will want to make you happy, so I doubt that (assuming he is a decent guy) he will ever want to force you to do anything you don't want to do.

So to answer your question, the future holds a lot of possibilities. It largely depends on you and your partner, but what you want certainly isn't impossible to achieve. 




 Wow, that's so awesome! I'm glad that everyone at your work seems to be cool with it all, and that your mom is supporting you too! I hope things go well with your life from now on, and good luck! : 




 Well obviously if there weren't any out trans people education and awareness would be an issue. However, it is the individual's choice as to whether or not they want to be out. A lot of people go stealth after transitioning because they want people to just consider them the gender that they identify as rather than having "become" that gender or thinking they "aren't actually a man/woman". 




 I think it would be better if we made it safe for trans people to exist first. If there were no horrible consequences for telling someone about your identity then I could understand the resentment over hiding it. But until that point, trans people are still stuck between a rock and a hard place - be forced to hide your identity or face severe, lasting consequences for being out. 




 If I were you I would have said pretty much the same thing.

I hate when people try to frame the discussion about trans people coming out around this idea that it's somehow cis people's right to know exactly what kind of genitals everyone has and if you think that should be private information you're some kind of deceitful asshole. You aren't doing anything wrong by existing as a trans person - if someone pursues you mistaking your gender that's their mistake, and it's really not that big a deal. Hell, if they might even find that they aren't as straight as they think they are. How is that a bad thing? 




 Ugh. This is why I don't come out to doctors. 




 The problem with this, however, is that being trans puts you in a near-constant state of anxiety and danger. There have been so many cases of trans people getting brutally beaten or murdered because they were outed. When a trans person doesn't tell people they're trans, it's not because it might be a "deal-breaker" for some people, they're doing it for survival. 




 It's not really a "may be" at this point, it's fact. The number of states and countries that have legalized marriage equality is growing pretty quickly, but there are much fewer places that have comprehensive human rights protections for trans people. In the US they've been trying to pass federal legislation to make it illegal to discriminate against someone for their sexual orientation or gender identity, but conservatives are having none of that and many people in Congress have been pushing for a compromised version that excludes trans rights. 




 Actually there are more than two sexes - intersex people exist, and pansexual covers attraction to them as well. 




 US here. I say for fuck's sake relatively often, although not nearly as often as fucking hell. 




 I spent easily 5x more time in that level than I should have because I did my best to get rid of every damn block. 




 Well really it's more of a subset of the second one. It might be real but you're not it because once you fall in love with Prince Charming you'll get over it real fast. Because that's how women's sexuality works - you absolutely don't care about sex until you get married and then only for pleasing your husband and having kids. /s 




 In my experience, triggers aren't that predictable. You never really know when it will happen, and it might never go away. I haven't lived with my abuser for almost four years now and I still get anxiety attacks occasionally.

However, talking to a therapist and other survivors about it has helped me gain perspective and practice coping mechanisms for it. So even though the triggers haven't gone away, they don't affect me quite as badly because now I handle them a lot better. So there's that.

As far as moving on, you aren't "supposed" to do anything. You don't just "get over" abuse - it stays with you pretty much forever. But it usually starts to affect you less and less, gradually over time. Just take things at your own pace and do what's healthy for you. Talk to a therapist or abuse counselor if you aren't already. Do things a day at a time. Eventually it will get better. 




 Yeah, this sort of thing is super common and is really shitty. Black women have to deal with so much ridiculousness because of combined racism and sexism, I see it a lot in the southern US where I live. It really makes me want to be a better feminist and activist in general when I find threads like that, because a lot of people are totally clueless about how bad some women of color have it. 




 Mine was pretty fun! I got to hang out with some good friends for most of the weekend, although not much is new with my life. My SO, on the other hand, recently started dating someone he met on OkCupid that goes to our university. She came over Saturday and we all watched anime for a little while, then after I left to go hang with people they got some private time. And they had their first kiss! When I got home my SO was so happy and they're really adorable together so I'm glad things are going really well. : 




 I'm not sure yet. If I made a matching scarf it would be really big and take a lot of time and yarn (Journey scarves make the Fourth Doctor's scarf look like child's play). But I might make a scaled-down version, I dunno. 




 Maybe it only wants to stick around if it's combined with another colors and they can be friends 




 Huh ... not sure how that works, but ok, lol. 




 Well in my experience, freshman tend to be much less mature than upperclassmen (at least if they're not non-traditional students). They're younger and are just starting to gain more freedom from their parents' influence, so they don't always have experience in critical thinking skills or  making decisions for themselves. Therefore they're much more likely to go along with the status quo.

The good news is that in college, a lot of people I know went from being barely tolerable douchebags to actually being really awesome, well-rounded people. So the more you continue on, the better your peer group should get.

IN the mean time, though, just don't worry about the haters. Instead of thinking about the people leaving you as a loss of a friend, try to think of it as removing a person from your life who is not supporting you. Your time is valuable and finite - you shouldn't have to waste time on people who don't have your back. 




 That's what I'm afraid of! I don't want to have to redye it.

So which colors usually last longest, then? 




 /r/genderfluid might be a good place to check out too? 




 That sounds awesome! I've been thinking about doing some strawberry blonde, I've been flirting with the idea of red hair for a while now but I've heard it's really hard to manage compared to other dye colors. 




 I'd love to see it! An album of rainbow hair, lol. It might inspire me to do something fun with my hair :D 




 Generally, unless there is an entirely empty row or the empty seat is next to someone who is physically less threatening to me (isn't bigger than me, is elderly, etc.), I tend to stand. I live in a really sketchy part of town, and depend on public transportation to get where I need to go. This means that I and my roommates have all had various run-ins with people on busses. People have tried to solicit us for sex, tried to sell us drugs, have demanded money, tried to follow us, have sexually harassed us, or have told us we're going to hell for being queer, to name only a few occurrences. So yeah, I tend to just keep to myself as much as possible. Standing means less likely to get hassled. 




 You look so happy and fabulous! I love all your awesome hair colors : 




 I realize why you might want to create such a subreddit and that it might have the potential for doing a lot of good, but to me it seems like it also has way too much potential for abuse and I most likely will not be participating. The reason why existing subs have such strict rules is to create a safe space for oppressed peoples to have discussion; taking away those restrictions makes the space inherently less safe. 




 Actually, the modern definition is there to keep in mind the context in which certain actions happen. If person A and person B walk into a room and person B starts freaking out and refuses to talk to person A and wants to leave, according to your definition of prejudice person B is in the wrong. Why would they randomly do something like that just because of some arbitrary factor of person A's appearance or personality?

But then if you look at the situation in context and find out that person A belongs to a group of people that has systematically abused people like person B, that reaction starts to make a lot more sense. They react negatively to that person not because they are arbitrarily deciding that they don't like them, but because history and lived experience has taught them that being around that person will likely result in bad things happening. It will cause them stress, as well as the potential for physical harm or even death, with little consequences for person A.

To conclude, kids on a reservation not wanting to play with the white children which might hurt their feelings is in no way comparable to the systematic genocide which has been perpetuated against native peoples in the Americas for the last 500+ years. 




 When you invite an abuser and their victim to the same party, that's not a neutral ground. If you tell the victim to be "civil" to their abuser, that's not a neutral ground. Understand?

Exactly this. I wish I could upvote you more than once. 




 Finding more friends is also probably a good idea. I hope everything works out ok for you. Good luck in the future! 




 It's okay, just breathe!

I know that this sort of thing is really nerve-wracking, but perhaps it might help if you focus on something else while waiting for a response? After all, it's not like you can do anything about it until she texts you back, no matter what she says. So try to take a few minutes and relax, do something calming, and worry about what she'll do after she actually does it. 




 I don't think that it's necessarily bad for them to want to participate in the comments, but they shouldn't be overstepping their bounds. Obviously this subreddit is meant to get women's opinions or thoughts on things, so if a bunch of guys answered with their thoughts or opinions all the time it would kind of defeat the point.

Of course, I still think they should be allowed to respond to women's answers. Like if they wanted to compare a response they see to their own observations, or ask for more details, or even just to say "TIL".

So yeah, basically as long as they don't try to take over the subreddit it shouldn't be too big of an issue. 




 Non-transitioning transwoman still means you're a woman. I would say it's actually pretty important for you to answer so that we have different perspectives. If straight white cis women were the only people who responded to questions people would get incomplete or even misleading answers sometimes, so really your responses could be very helpful! 




 That's a really tough position to be in. I've also had issues with people I'm really good friends with then getting SOs and kind of ignoring everyone else. This isn't an issue with you necessarily, but more likely an issue with your friend and her bf. A lot of people fall into the trap of hanging out almost exclusively with their partner to the detriment of their other relationships. It happens.

Honestly, to me it seems like her bf is a little too controlling. If he was getting super jealous and making a fuss over her hanging out with you, it's possible he twisted her arm until she caved and stopped hanging out with you to make him feel more comfortable. That's pretty stupid, especially since you don't seem to be romantically interested in her, just really good friends. If that is what happened, bad on him for being really possessive and bad on her for not standing up to him.

It's also possible that they're just going through a kind of honeymoon phase since they just got to move in together. If he lived farther away before and they didn't get to see each other that often, it's only natural that she would want to hang out with him a lot now that she has the opportunity, but she takes you for granted because you've always been close by. That will start to fade at some point, though. It's really hard to only hang out with your SO for extended periods of time.

My advice is to just wait this out for a little while. If your friend continues to ignore you in favor of her SO, try to talk to her about it. If she really cares for you she'll probably try to hang out with you at least a little more, regardless of what her boyfriend says. Also, it may or may not help to talk to this bf and tell him that you're not trying to steal her away and make her your gf or anything, but this girl is a close friend and it sucks that he's monopolizing all her time. She should be able to socialize with whomever she wants. 




 I'd say that you sound like someone who is bi- or homoflexible-romantic ace. Really that's up to you. Of course, lots of people who identify as gay or otherwise queer have had hetero relationships in the past and truly liked the person(s) they were with. But sometimes you just realize that sort of thing isn't what you prefer. That's okay.

FYI, lots of bi people (ace or otherwise) have a preference for one gender. I've known bi people who were physically attracted to one gender and romantically attracted to another, or who preferred one gender but didn't mind dating or having sex with people who weren't that gender. You don't have to like everyone equally to be biromantic. Really though the label is more about what you're comfortable with and what you want to communicate to other people about yourself, so if you're at the point where you don't really want to be with men then identifying as homoromantic is fine. 




 Yes. This happens to me a lot.

Of course, I'm fairly masculine and often cross-dress so most people read me as "butch lesbian." I have short hair, I hang out with a lot of dudes, I love action movies and play video games ... I guess I fit a lot of the stereotypes that people assume apply to lesbians.

Strangely, though, people will often assume that I'm straight if they meet me with my SO, who is male. So with new people it often goes either way. Meet us as a couple, I'm a straight tomboy. Meet me by myself, I'm a butch lesbian. Meanwhile I just go "you're all wrong but it will take way too much effort to correct you so whatever." 




 I had to read through a lot of stuff for my epidemiology class last semester about this sort of thing. According to the CDC, it's a problem because people demand antibiotics for everything (they were marketed as a magic bullet for decades) and doctors cave in, plus with factory farms and whatnot we're pumping our animals full of antibiotics and then you get MRSA.  




 There's also the "you just haven't found the right person yet" argument. I've heard that one soooooo many times. 




 My personal experience with other queer people has been pretty similar to yours. Other GSM people have only been slightly more likely to be aware of asexuality compared to straight people I've come out to. And I've had more than my share of people tell me that it's not really a thing and I'm just trying to be a "special snowflake" and I'm taking attention away from the "real" queers. It sucks. But fortunately not everyone is like that. 




 Well speaking as a kid who was adopted, it's less about who your parents are and more about the fact that they love you. There are tons of kids in foster care who need to be adopted into loving homes. By adopting you are giving that kid a new chance at a life they wouldn't have otherwise. That doesn't suddenly change because you're gay.

I'm glad someone else was able to help you find UK-related info! 




 Well usually I would say yes, it is possible, because lots of asexual people have sex with their partners, myself included, with relatively few issues. However, if you've already tried lubes, foreplay, etc. and you are still having issues, it's probably time to talk to a doctor. It's possible that there's something going on with your body if penetrative sex isn't going well, so it's probably a good idea to talk to a gyno just in case. 




 But there was also another episode where they got caught in nightmares manufactured by Doctor Destiny (John Dee - also I loved the historical reference for that character). Flash's nightmare was that he was so fast everyone else just stopped moving. He became isolated because he was just too fast for other people. So I'd say it's probably still something he thinks a lot about. 




 I just rewatched all of the Justice League cartoon. The number of times where Batman must think "fuck, uh, hang on ... lemme pull out my gadgets" whenever all the other members just decide to fly/run super fast to get somewhere was a lot higher than I remembered from my childhood days. 




 Yes. It seems like a lot of anime these days just uses blatant fan-service to get ratings, and it is sooooooo tiring. So few shows are willing to go without unnecessary or nonsensical gratuitous T A anymore.

Literally the only show I can think of that I've watched recently without any fan service or vapid female characters is Attach on Titan. That's it. 




 That's rough. I recommend a nice nap. 




 Honestly, I don't get it either. You can still have a fantastic, memorable event without having to spend tens of thousands of dollars. That's just ridiculous. You don't need a $15,000 dress. You don't need caviar or expensive alcohol. You don't need a lot of the nonsense that some people have at their weddings. It's basically just a show of financial status these days more than a celebration of love for a lot of people. But in ten or twenty years, that won't matter - no one will really care how much money you spent on your wedding. What's important is that you and your family and friends all got together and made some memories. 




 Who says that museums aren't entertaining? I love looking at different pieces of history. 




 Thanks for such a well-written response. Honestly, I don't go to the library as much as I used to, but when I was a kid it was one of my favorite places to go. I've always been a huge reader, and I didn't have money for a tablet or ereader (or even new books, really) so the library helped me get access to all sorts of books. It definitely improved my quality of life - most of the things I know I know from reading, and it gave me a good head start in school that I otherwise wouldn't have had.

Plus, there is an important social component to libraries. Like you said, they are community spaces. I would often go to the library to hang out with friends after school. They often have workshops where you can learn new skills, or book clubs where you can meet people with common interests. It's a lot harder to get that sort of thing for free on the internet - people who live near you that can give you that sort of experience. Not to say that forums and chat rooms can't do similar things, but I don't think that interaction online will ever fully replace interaction in the real world.

Also, the library policy changes made after 9/11 just proves how awesome libraries are, at least imho. 




 As far as the kids thing goes, it's not impossible. I don't know how adoption laws work in the UK but that seems like a pretty viable option. Of course if you wanted your own biological child and had some money you could use a donor egg and surrogate mom. So you should tell your mom that grandkids aren't completely out of the picture.

On the other hand, you still have the issue that same sex relationships "make her feel ill." Honestly, this is kind of silly, but a lot of straight people have the homophobic tendency to be a little squeamish about gay couples. Hopefully, though, she'll get over it with time, especially if she realizes that there really isn't a reason to be squeamish and if she sees you being happy in a relationship.

A support group would probably be a good idea for your parents, or at least your mom. Again, I don't live in the UK so I don't know any specifics, but you should try searching on the internet for an LGBTQ organization in your area. They can likely help you out with finding resources for your parents, possibly a support group, or even just talking to them - they're probably more practiced at it than you are and they might be able to give your parents some perspective. Plus, it always helps to hear it from multiple people.

Other than that, just keep doing what you've been doing. Answer their questions and show them you love them. Your parents seem like they're just worried about you, but once they get used to the fact that you're gay they probably won't worry as much about it.

I hope that helps, and good luck! 




 I'm glad that you feel better about yourself! No, there is nothing wrong with you. You're just like the rest of us : 




 Wow, what a dirtbag. It's totally okay to be bothered by someone saying shitty things about you, regardless of how immature and stupid they are. Just remember that it's better to not respond, because that kind of moron is only going to hurl more and more insults at you. 




 I'd say that ultimately joining is up to you. I've found that the LGBTQ organizations on my campus are nice to go to if for no other reason than to have people I can talk to about being queer. Although there aren't that many aces on campus that are also active in the groups, it does help a little to be around other people who you know are more likely to be aware of your identity and less likely to judge you for it (although there are still some people who can be just as nasty as the rest of the heteronormative world).

If you don't think you'll get any good out of it, though, there's not much of a point in joining. If I were you I'd at least try it out for a little while just to see if I'd like it or not, but I wouldn't say it's unreasonable to not want to. 




 they group sets of believes and people subscribe to all of them, without judging each individual one on their merits

This is not true. That's why each broader movement has so many different subgroups. People are individuals, not hive-minds. No label is perfect, nor does any one person truly fit perfectly with that label.

Also, your description of what feminists "generally" do is merely a generalization. I've had many, many discussions with people where they were willing to debate or answer questions, and I always make an effort to do so unless someone is deliberately being offensive. Although, it is true that further discussion is often easier whenever someone is at least somewhat familiar with theory, thus feminists (or any other person with extensive knowledge in a topic) will often recommend reading to people who are interested in finding out more.

I can't speak for all feminists or the entire movement, but the way I try to approach things is to try to work with people to create awareness of problems, find solutions, and work toward a common goal. It's not about who is superior, because no one is truly superior, at least not in the sense that you're using the word. What's more important is that people learn from one another; sometimes I am teaching other people, but just as often I learn new things as well. No one knows anything, so anyone who thinks that they're superior to everyone else has a flawed personality or worldview.

That's my two cents, anyhow. 




 Well the point that I was trying to make is that trans people are more likely to experience societal privileges as long as no one knows they're trans, either before they ever come out/start transitioning or after they've fully transitioned and go stealth. Of course, even after transitioning a lot of trans people still have to deal with a lot of stuff, especially if they get outed. 




 Yep. People tend to assume I'm a lesbian all the time when they meet me. And I've gotten a lot of the "you probably just haven't met the right one yet" line more than a few times. 




 Gay guys that do that drive me crazy. Seriously, it's okay that you're not into vaginas. But you really don't need to go around constantly talking about how disgusting you think they are. It's not like there's a magical vagina fairy that can wave a wand and make them all pretty so they sparkle or shoot rainbows. We don't get to wish on a star and magically transform our bodies to please everyone. Jeez. 




 Yeah, there's that ... one of my good friends used to joke that Seed/Destiny were basically just really long toy commercials, because allllll the model kits. 




 Trust me, you're not missing much. You would only rage at her more as the series went on. 




 Seed and seed destiny were pretty terrible in general, let's be honest. 




 That's a good idea. I'll save up a bit and check it out. 




 Well I am, and I call myself a feminist. I understand why a lot of people have issues with it but really the only way to fix the movement is from within, so refusing to call yourself a feminist just because you don't agree with some feminists isn't really effective, at least imho. To each their own, though. 




 Same. Also, whenever I was watching Seed Destiny there was a character that I pretty much instantly hated and couldn't figure out why until I realized they used the same voice actress for both characters. 




 Good! I'm glad I could help. : 




 I'm so jealous! I've always wanted to do loom-weaving but I would never be able to afford a large loom like that. The most I can manage is a tiny bead loom ... 




 Same! I just love to hate Dio. His rivalry with Jojo is just too delicious to watch. 




 Flay Allster, from Gundam Seed.

On top of being incredibly racist, she is pretty much the culmination of every negative stereotype about women ever. She uses her body to make connections with powerful men to get what she wants (while cheating on her fiance). She flaunts her body to get attention. She's emotionally manipulative. She's completely fucking useless every time they're in battle and just goes running to some boy crying for protection. Oh, and she very nearly manages to fuck up several battles and almost the entire war for her side.

She is literally the worst character in any anime I've ever seen. 




 Thanks for the link! It's a pretty good one.

I really like that the speaker brought up the blog quotes talking about how just because you're not trying to get in a woman's pants doesn't automatically make you a feminist. I've talked to so many women who have had gay guys critically comment on their appearance, touch or grope their bodies without permission, etc. but when they tell them no the man will respond "oh, it's okay, I'm gay, it's not like I want to have sex with you." 

Seriously, just because you aren't physically attracted to someone doesn't mean it's okay for you to say that they're ugly, or tell them their genitals are nasty, or to fondle their breasts or ass. That shit is not cool. 




 Honestly, though, the academic discourse isn't even the problem so much as their misapplication of it - the idea that having a penis gives you privilege is true, even in the case of trans women, because for at least some portion of their lives trans women are raised as male. So while they are living as male, they do have privileges women don't. But that changes once they start to transition because people start to perceive them as female. If people assume you have a vagina they will treat you like they treat anyone else with a vagina. And this is what makes it so hard for trans women - they're getting misogyny from people, and if they don't pass well or are outed they have to deal with transmisogyny too.

But for some reason radfems can't see this. Having a penis doesn't mean you are always perceived as male, and unless you are perceived as male by society you won't get the privileges associated with having a penis.

Also, yes, you are the absolute worst kind of dick of you shit on trans people in the name of female solidarity. 




 Most of the changes that I liked were really small, because I appreciate subtlety. But I think that one of my favorites is probably the alterations to Tyrion and Sansa's wedding.

In the books, we view the wedding from Sansa's POV, so we're getting all of her internal thought processes throughout the ceremony. During the whole affair we read how humiliating and traumatizing this is for her. At one point she was promised to Joffrey, the prince of the kingdom, whom she assumed was as gallant as all the stories made knights out to be. Then he executed her father and viciously abused her, as well as making most of the knights she would have gone to for help complicit in that abuse. She was deemed practically untouchable after her father was declared "traitor," and she ends up being handed off to Tyrion, who is quite possibly the most insulting marriage proposal she could possibly be given. Not only is he a Lannister (therefore an enemy of her family), he is her abuser's uncle (so she will never be rid of him), and to top it all off he's a dwarf (which everyone in the kingdom seems more than happy to ridicule him for).

Understandably, Sansa is not happy about the situation. But she's also made it this far by the fact that she's pretty much gone along with whatever tortures the Lannisters think up for her. If she objects, she could very well be the next to die. But she can't just take it. So she fights back in what little way she can - by refusing to bow to allow Tyrion to cloak her as part of the ceremony. In her mind, she is refusing to debase herself further in an already terrible situation. Eventually, Tyrion is forced to climb on someone's back to finish the cloaking.

However, this scene only works when told from Sansa's POV. If the scene played out the same way in the show, all we would get out of it would be Sansa, for some inexplicable reason, suddenly deciding to be an asshole to Tyrion, a character that everyone seems to like considerably more than her. It would not do well in the show since we don't have access to Sansa's thoughts and reasoning for doing such a thing.

So rather than try to make the scene work as it exists, they changed it for the show, and I think it was a masterful stroke. This time around, Tyrion had a step stool placed so that he could easily reach Sansa's shoulders for the cloaking, but Joffrey being the sadistic scum that he is decides to pull it away at the last second. Then Sansa bows so he can cloak her. I love how they decided to change the scene, because it takes care of all the issues presented by portraying it from an outside rather than first-person perspective while still keeping everyone in character. In the show version we have Joffrey being a dick rather than Sansa being the one who is humiliating Tyrion, which means we don't have people feeling conflicted or irritated with Sansa when they're supposed to be relating to her. Instead, we just hate Joffrey more, which only helps the story along. Plus, we have Sansa witnessing how Joffrey tortures Tyrion just like he tortures her - this is a good setup for their later relationship. Eventually Sansa comes to like and trust Tyrion a little, despite her wariness over his lineage, because she can relate to how he suffers and realizes that he's not nearly as bad as his father, sister, or nephew. By having Joff humiliate Tyrion at the wedding, Sansa can immediately relate to her new husband; this means she's still in character as well, despite the contradicting actions her character takes in the book to movie transition.

I know that I wrote a lot about something so tiny but speaking as someone who loves literature and has studied theater techniques I just really appreciate what they did in the show to this particular scene. 




 I'm sure that Ned would have fought for himself if he was healthy, but considering he'd been injured fighting Jaime there's no way that would happen. Ned is honorable, but not suicidal. Given the chance he might have named a champion, but we'll never know because that's not the way it went down. 




 You know, I never caught that. Although I haven't discovered anything else to confirm or deny whether or not Varys heard the conversation, it would be really interesting if he had. It certainly has some interesting implications for how Ned's betrayal turned out. 




 You didn't format your spoiler properly ... might want to fix that. 




 There is unfortunately an entire subreddit dedicated to this stuff. It made me weep for feminists and women everywhere ... 




 To be fair, not all feminists think that way - in fact, third-wave feminism focuses on intersectionality and is a lot more inclusive to queer women, women of color, and other minority groups than feminism has ever been in the past. The blog post OP linked to represents one radical sect of feminism, and those views are not shared by everyone in the movement, any more than trans-exclusion is practiced by everyone in the queer rights movement. 




 TERFs are probably one of the worst things to ever come out of the feminist movement. It's so disgusting. A lot of their rantings sound very similar to the KKK's arguments about race traitors and whatnot. Trans women are not threatening other women, they often have it worse than cis women do. Radfems who cannot seem to understand that ... it makes me so sad and angry. Everything would be so much better for all of us if women would stop acting like this and actually band together to help out ALL women, not just the women who are like them. 




 I honestly have no idea why so many gynos are men ... it's weird. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that there are fewer female doctors in general, I dunno. 




 For most of my life I didn't know anyone else who was openly asexual, although I wasn't entirely open about it either.

However, when I started college I moved to the only city that (at the time) was the only one in the state that had passed comprehensive anti-discrimination laws for queer people (including trans*, which is still really uncommon). For those of you who live in the U.S., I live in a state that has been red for the last four elections. For everyone else, it's pretty much conservative except in a few major cities.

The result of this legislation, though, is that my city has a comparatively huge population of GRSM people. My school has a large and very active queer student activity center and activism group. And I now know probably 5x as many queer people as I used to in high school, at least.

This has included several ace people. My current roommate and his partner identify as ace or demi, a friend of mine from a school club is ace, and after coming out on facebook I found out that a friend from my high school days is ace as well. We've had a lot of conversations about identity and ace issues, and it's been really great. For my entire childhood I felt isolated and lonely because literally none of my friends knew how I felt. Now, I have people I can turn to that understand how I feel about romance, sex, relationships, etc. without me having to explain a totally new concept to them.

It hasn't always gone well, however. There have still been some people who, after I tell them about my identity, have claimed to feel the same way and then it later turned out they weren't being entirely honest. One person in particular lied to his partner (whom I was good friends with) and said he was asexual merely to avoid having sex with him. When my friend later found out about the lie and told me about it I was pretty upset. This person used my identity as an excuse to get out of something, when telling the truth would have been easier anyway, and then tried to make out like he was the victim. Ugh. It's hard enough to get people to take me seriously when I tell them about asexuality - there are so many who are willing to dismiss me by saying I can't or don't actually feel that way. People like him who fake it just make things so much worse. 




 Telling them you're asexual might be difficult, but telling them you're not interested isn't nearly as hard. A lot of guys don't want to hear that, though, and just ignore what you say unfortunately ... 




 How do you prevent any domestic abuse from happening? Like I said, problematic situations come up in any marriage, not just polygamy. The only way to prevent exploitation is to have a bunch of decent human beings get together. You can't argue that polygamy is a huge issue for exploitation and therefore we shouldn't have it because monogamous relationships have the exact same potential for exploitation. Unless you want to get rid of marriage or relationships altogether this sort of thing will happen. The only way to change it is to change patriarchal attitudes, which a lot of people in modern polyamorous relationships are already doing.

And really you don't have to make tons of extra laws and regulations. Every partner involved in a polygamous marriage would have the same rights as any other married couple. 




 Oh, good! I would hate to be sick on a holiday. I hope you feel all better really soon! 




 The most I've ever had in one sitting is two drinks, so I've never had issues with hangovers. I do not envy you there. Honestly I have just as much fun watching other people get drunk and be silly as other people have fun getting drunk, so I never felt a huge need to drink too much.

Still, it seems like you would have been okay with only three shots and that much food. 




 Oh jeez. That's not good. Did someone else buy drinks and put them on your tab or something? I imagine it's hard for one person to drink over $500 worth of alcohol in one night ... 




 Those sorts of issues aren't inherent to polygamous relationships, however. Also, not all polygamy is polygyny (multiple women with one male partner) - there are also historical situations in which polyandry was common and in fact beneficial.

Really, though, in Western patriarchal society, marriage PERIOD is oppressive to women. So as we improve marriage in general, polygamous marriages are improved.

Plus, I really don't see the point in arguing that because something is harder or more complicated we shouldn't do it. Of course poly relationships require more effort and are more complicated than relationships with only two people. Large extended families also tend to be more difficult to manage and more complex than families with single or no children. That doesn't mean people shouldn't have five or six kids if they have the means, or that three or more generations of a family can't live together. There are plenty of situations in which poly groups are just as good or even better than the "traditional" nuclear family, despite being more complex. To use an analogy, if we were talking about math you wouldn't say that we shouldn't teach calculus to anyone because it's more complicated and harder than simple addition, would you?

Really this isn't a matter of something being bad because it's complicated, it's a matter of everyone doing what's right for them. For some people, that happens to be polyamory and polygamy. For others, it's monogamy. 




 I love how this guy is describing polygamy like it would be the most awful ridiculous thing ever, but in reality it sounds kind of nice. I totally wouldn't mind if my primary partner and I and anyone else we bring into our relationship could all live together in one big happy group marriage. 




 Hello, everyone! How was your New Year's Eve?

Mine was rather eventful. I just happened to start my shark week yesterday (ugh) and I have really awful cramps, especially on the first day. Then on top of that my SO wanted to go to this party where I basically knew him and one other guy (he'll be M) at all well. I'd also met a lot of the other attendees but I only see them once in a while and I certainly wouldn't consider them friends but more like acquaintances. I'm the type of person that likes to hang out with people I know well at large parties, so I'm usually uncomfortable when I only have one or two friends but everyone else knows each other really well. So I assumed that I would most likely be miserable for most of the night.

Instead, I actually had a lot of fun! I was probably the only person who didn't drink much - I had a small glass of champagne and just had soda the rest of the night (didn't want to feel drunk icky on top of period icky). Everyone else seemed to be having a good time for the most part. I had some really great conversations with people that I didn't know that well, which was really fun and unexpected.

Then a few people got a little too drunk ... or maybe a lot. Our one friend (let's call him T) had apparently started drinking before coming to the party we were at, and had quite a bit while we were there, so he was pretty wrecked. He threw up Linda Blair style all over like three other people. They were obviously upset but took it all in stride and started a mini shirtless guy party, so much fun was still had by all. Well, M ended up taking care of T while he prayed to the porcelain god, so I stayed downstairs and chatted with M's girlfriend, C. Then C ended up getting sick too, although not so sick she passed out like T did ... poor guy.

I can't say I expected to spend two or so hours holding back some girl's hair that I barely knew as part of my New Year's celebrations, but I don't really regret it. C is really nice, and we ended up getting along really well despite the puking. We kinda bonded last night, and the four of us (my SO, C, M, and I) all agreed to hang out more in the future, sans alcohol.

That said, I hope that the rest of you had fun ushering in the new year, and that nobody got seriously hurt while drinking. Just remember that you have to watch your friends and make sure to take care of each other so that no one drinks too much or get hurt. Nobody wants to make a hospital visit on NYE. 




 Unfortunately, even gay men often think that they are entitled to power over women's bodies. In this case, this dude thinks he is entitled to rating your physical appearance. I would say that is definitely rude, regardless of his sexuality. His opinion was not asked for, nor did it need to be given. 




 Don't worry, it's totally normal to be worried about this sort of thing. Since you're worried about pain, I assume you're female-bodied? Or are you concerned about hurting a female-bodied partner? Either way, I'll try to give you some tips.

1. Don't have sex before you're ready. This should seem obvious, but a lot of teens are pressured into doing something that they later regret. I'm not going to tell you that you absolutely shouldn't have sex until you're older (although 15 is a little young, and can have legal implications depending on where you live and the age of your partner). However, if you want to have sex you should make sure that you're doing it because it's what you want, not because you feel obligated to or your partner wants you to do it.

2. Just because you aren't "turned on" by someone in general doesn't mean that your body won't have a physiological response to sexual situations. Even as an ace, if someone touches you, you will most likely experience some parts of physical arousal - for instance, if you are female bodied you will still lubricate or "get wet." This is something that happens regardless of sexual desire - women's bodies have evolved to be that way in case of sexual trauma so that they aren't severely hurt. So if you are concerned about lubrication, this will most likely not be an issue, although if it is you can still use artificial lubricant.

3. This leads to your comment about condom/lube use. [This link](http://www.healthyhorns.utexas.edu/hs_lube.html) has some quick tips for combinations of condoms and lube. You can buy these sorts of things online or in any drug store. Just make sure to read all instructions carefully to make sure that you are using each product correctly, and that combining them won't cause issues - usually a lube will have a label saying if it is safe for use with latex condoms. I would highly recommend using a condom, even if you or your partner is using other forms of birth control, to reduce the risk of infections or STDs. Safer sex every time means you develop good habits and have less risk in the future!

4. Go slowly. Especially if it is your first time having sex. Instead of jumping straight into penetrative sex, take a little bit of time to kiss and touch with your partner. You can then move on to manual stimulation or oral sex. This will help for a lot of reasons - first, it will help you become more familiar with your partner and get more comfortable with them. Second, it can help you become more physically relaxed and receptive to sex. If you have vaginal sex, it allows for more time to produce enough lubrication. Once you do start having penetrative vaginal or anal sex, you should still go slowly at first. For someone who is female-bodied, it will most likely be uncomfortable or even slightly painful at first if you have an unbroken hymen. If at any point you or your partner experiences moderate/high amounts of pain, stop right away. Sex should never hurt that badly (unless you want it to).

5. Once you become sexually active, you should make sure to tell your doctor. If you are female-bodied, this often also means starting to see a gynocologist. Most doctors recommend that you start seeing a gyno when you are 18 or if you are sexually active, whichever comes first. This is important for your continued sexual health - going to see your gyno for regular pap smears ensures that you don't have any issues, and the gyno can also answer any questions you have about sex or sexual health and address any issues you might have.

I hope that answers a lot of the questions you have so far. If you want to know anything else, shoot me a reply or a message. This was just generic info that would be helpful for anyone but I can also tell you more about my personal experience if you're interested. 




 To answer your initial question, no, being transexual does not mean you have the sexuality of the opposite sex. It means that your gender does not align with your physiological sex. Those are two very different things.

If you feel like you should have a vagina or breasts or that you are too hairy, etc. that is called gender dysphoria. You feel like the current state of your body doesn't quite match up with what should be there, right? I'd say that's a pretty big sign you're trans. Of course, you should probably talk to a queer-friendly counselor about this - they can help you better understand those feelings and you can discuss the possibility of transitioning with them.

As far as having a lot in common with gay men, I don't see anything particularly wrong with that. Personally, I'm female but I usually relate a lot more easily to guys because I'm fairly masculine. That doesn't invalidate my womanhood or identity. You're allowed to like what you like - no two women are the same, and there is no one "right" way to be female. Plus, peeing standing up is a pretty useful skill, especially if you don't have a toilet handy while camping or what have you.

So don't worry too much about that sort of thing! I hope that clears some things up for you, and I hope that you figure out your identity and find happiness in the future. 




 The first time I went to see a gyno, my mom told me to go to the guy she sees, but she had to work that day so she had her mom (my grandma) take me. It was then that grandma told me that not only does she also see the same gyno, but he delivered me. And he also delivered my mom. So basically this dude has been around to see three generations of my family's vagina. 




 Wow. After reading through some of these comments I'm a bit disappointed. There are a lot of people on here who don't seem to understand the idea that cross-dressing can be another form of gender expression and you don't have to be MTF or FTM transgender in order to want to dress differently. Some people just feel more comfortable or that they look better wearing different clothes. Why is it such a huge issue that a man wants to wear dresses and makeup but still be a man? THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF QUEER MKAY 
























 As a native Kentuckian, it really sucks living in pretty much the only oasis of liberal politics in the sea of Republicans and Tea Party crazies ... 




 Well, what happens now largely depends on you and your girlfriend. If your girlfriend is asexual (although it seems possible that she's in the gray-area), that doesn't necessarily mean that you can no longer sustain a relationship, but you will have to make some decisions as a couple.

First, she probably needs some time to figure out how she feels about sex. Just because someone is asexual doesn't mean they won't ever have sex; there is a lot of variation among aces, just like with everyone else. Some aces can't stand sex and don't ever want to have it. Others are pretty neutral toward it and don't really care either way. Others actually do enjoy sex. The key to asexuality is not necessarily that the person doesn't have an interest in sex (although this is pretty common), just that they don't experience sexual attraction. It is possible that your girlfriend will still have sex with you, or perhaps she will decide that she's not comfortable with that. It's up to her. Just give her time, don't pressure her into making up her mind right away, and make sure to respect her decision when she does make it.

Now on to you. It seems like you have a real problem with the idea that your girlfriend might not be sexually interested in you. A lot of people with asexual partners have similar issues, probably because in general sexual attraction is seen as a prerequisite for love in our culture. People typically develop a physical attraction and then a romantic one, or both happen simultaneously, so if you find out that your partner isn't physically attracted to you it can make you seriously question the legitimacy of your relationship. If I would hazard a guess, I'd say that this might be part of why you are feeling hurt right now. That's okay. This sort of thing can be difficult to handle. However, I just want you to be aware that for asexual people, a lack of physical attraction does not mean that they love you any less. They just love you in a different way.

I hope that this helps, feel free to ask any other questions. Hopefully you and your girlfriend will also be able to figure things out, and good luck in the future. 




 Lol that was definitely a wise decision on your part. My roommate suggested that and he got sooooo much hate mail for it. 




 Yeah, if you ship Irene and Sherlock you will be torn apart on Tumblr. There are so many fans who will viciously defend the Johnlock ship because they have to protect their cute gays and womenz are just a distraction. Strangely enough, though, nearly all the fanatic Johnlock fans are cishet women .... 




 Yep. That's one of my biggest issues with the show. It really sucks that the writers are deliberately feeding into the way that the fans ship the two of them together, all of which is just exploitative and really icky if you ask me. 




 I imagine that a lot of trans* people also have clothes dysphoria, but I don't really consider myself transgender or genderqueer or anything really past crossdressing, because that dysphoria doesn't extend to my body. I'm actually pretty apathetic about being physically female. I identify as female because it's convenient, but if tomorrow I woke up male I wouldn't really care that much.

Also, I'd definitely say that she was in complete denial about her own bi/homophobia. A lot of people just don't realize that stuff like that is totally prejudiced. And no, your orientation has nothing to do with your partner's orientation - that's basically implying that you and your partner aren't separate people with your own individual tastes. That's silly. More accurately, your orientation might conflict with your partner's gender identity, but gender identity and sexual orientation aren't the same thing. Some people believe that orientation only relates to physical characteristics, so someone who is a heterosexual woman is attracted to penises, and therefore to be "straight" they can only date cis men. I think that's a little off, because trans men are still men and trans women are still women, so you can be straight even if you date trans people, assuming that they identify as the opposite gender. Perhaps this is what she was really referring to? But even in that case it's still shitty because it's transphobic. Either way, she's not being fair to you.

I can also relate to that idea of coming to terms with being a part of the LGBT community. I think part of the problem is that queer communities can be just as hierarchical as the general population. Plus, often times people who don't fit into the prescribed narrative of what it means to be "gay" or "trans" or whatever are ostracized. A lot of people try to argue that asexuals aren't really queer, for instance, because we are just "acting like we're special for attention" or "because we aren't really discriminated against" or because we have passing privilege. There's also unfortunately a lot of gay, cis people who don't like including other identities and orientations in the queer rights movement because they make things "too complicated." Too bad human beings are all really complicated and none of us fit perfectly into neat little box. 




 Um ... that's not what I was talking about. Of course there are different interpretations of what Sherlock's actual orientation is. I'm referring to how the show constantly makes gags about "SHERLOCK AND JOHN TOTALLY LOOK LIKE A GAY COUPLE HAR HAR" 




 I'm mostly happy with who I am too, it's just the occasional nagging in the back of my brain. But it's about the same as other people thinking things like "If only I could shed a few pounds" or "If only I were good at sports" etc. 




 Yeah, the only time I ever play COD or Halo is with people I know IRL that aren't total assholes.  




 I dunno. Honestly shit like that is basically why I will never really get into fighting games or FPS. I'm just not that great at them to begin with, and putting up with that sort of harassment and constant sexism is too exhausting.

I will take anybody on at Galaga, though! : 




 Yeah, I often think things like "It would be easier if I were straight" or "I wonder if my SO would find our relationship more fulfilling if I were a better sexual partner." It can be hard not to criticize yourself for any number of things that are outside of your control, especially your sexuality.

At the end of the day, though, I just have to accept myself for who I am. I can't change myself and become allosexual just by wishing it, and getting to preoccupied with "if only"s only causes you more stress. So I try my best to just be happy with the way I am. 




 Well, first I just wanna say that you've been through a really rough time and that sucks. I'm a panromantic asexual (ugh trying to explain that is so ridiculous). I'm female-bodied and identify as a woman, although I also frequently cross-dress, have a lot of "masculine" traits, and people usually assume I'm a butch lesbian. I've never had body-related dysphoria, but I have felt some dysphoria about wearing female clothes or makeup - I'm always uncomfortable, and I feel like I'm wearing a costume, not being myself. So I can certainly relate to a lot of what you're going through.

Secondly, liking someone who is queer doesn't make you not straight. My SO is hetero, dating a queer woman doesn't suddenly make him queer too. That is a really terrible excuse to break up with someone.

After having multiple people break up with you over this, all I can do is offer you my deepest sympathies. I know that it seems like you'll never find someone to accept you, but at the very least you don't make me uncomfortable and I won't judge you, and there's plenty of other nice internet folks out there who feel the same. It might help if you find a few friends that accept you, even if you can't find a partner right now.

I recently participated in an LGBT therapy group. We had a good mix of genders and orientations. Together we all were able to work out some of our anxieties, and it really helped all of us to know that there were other people struggling just like we were. If you can find a similar therapy or support group in your area, I would highly recommend trying to attend.

Finally, I just want to affirm that *you are not a freak*. There is nothing wrong with your orientation or gender being what it is. There are plenty of people out there just like you. Calling yourself a freak is an insult to all the awesome pan and trans* people out there! I know when you're depressed it's really hard to push away ugly thoughts like that, but I really hope that you can learn to deal with them and they won't take over.

Well I've rambled on long enough, but I hope that what I've said can help you, even if it's just a teeny bit. Feel free to PM me anytime if you just need someone to listen. You're not alone, okay? 




 It seems like you kinda answered your own question. "This is frustrating!!" After all, that's what most people really mean to say when they shout "that's so gay" while gaming. 




 Too bad Sherlock is also full of blatant gay-bating. :/ 




 Well, there are a lot of shows that you can make the case for a character being asexual (Sherlock, The Big Bang Theory, Community, etc.) but the main problem is that none of them openly identify as asexual and many of those same characters are also written as if they have some form of mental illness (Sherlock is bipolar, the rest are usually some form of autistic). 




 I would probably be a lot more excited about this if it weren't so cheesy ... /forever writing snob/ 




 Never read the comments. NEVER READ THE COMMENTS 




 And by "friend" you mean "asshole that is no longer a friend," yes? 




 This was basically my first poly experience in a nutshell. My SO started dating a woman who was already seeing two other guys, and the rest of them all treated me kind of shitty because the group dynamic centered around her, and since I wasn't dating her I was seen as an outlier, and therefore my feelings or opinions had the lowest priority. 




 First, yes, demisexual is a real thing. I'm ace, I know a lot of demis. Just throwing that out there.

But on to the poly stuff. I'm just not a jealous person, but rather extremely pragmatic, so I've never had an issue with that aspect. I do, however, take issue with deception or breaking boundaries. I think it really helps if you and your SO keep up constant, open, and honest communication. You should probably talk to him about your jealousy. Even if you don't want him to stop dating other people, he still might be able to help you work through some of that.

Also, speaking as someone who isn't sexual but also has a male allosexual (non-ace/gray/demi) partner, I can relate to the idea that you aren't going to be getting a lot of the same things out of poly. But that's okay. Instead of focusing on what he's getting that you're not, try thinking about what you *are* getting out of this relationship setup. For one thing, if you don't really enjoy sex that much (believe me, I can relate) then the fact that your SO can pursue sex with others takes some of the pressure off of you to perform sexually. This is actually the best benefit for me with my own relationship. Also, just as sexual feelings aren't limited in poly, romantic feelings aren't limited either. It doesn't really matter if you get attached to another partner in a way that your SO doesn't with his partners. Even if he only views you as a "serious romantic relationship" partner and all the others are "casual sexual relationship" partners, that has no relation to how you might feel about other partners. You don't have to do poly his way, find a way to do poly YOUR way.

Now for some dos and don'ts:

* DO set clear boundaries. If there are things that make either of you uncomfortable, you should voice them. Don't try to drop hints or beat around the bush and hope the other person catches on. Not setting up boundaries and sticking by them can lead to someone walking all over you or taking advantage of the gray area and hurting you. This is what nearly destroyed my relationship with my SO the first time he found a paramour - I didn't set clear boundaries, so he assumed certain things were okay that were definitely not okay.
* DON'T punish someone simply for having feelings. To me, one of the greatest benefits of poly relationships would be that it gives people the chance to explore their desires without fear of condemnation or negative repercussions on their current relationship. So if either of you develop feelings (romantic, sexual, whatever) for someone else, you can safely explore that without losing what you already have. Just remember that actions and feelings aren't the same, and that you generally can't change the way you feel about things just by wishing it, so there's no point in vilifying someone over it - this will only lead to resentment on both sides.
* DO communicate often. I can't stress this enough. You really need to talk to your partner. Good communication helps in any relationship, but it will especially save you a lot of headache with poly relationships. Just be honest with each other.
* DON'T be afraid to stand up for yourself. You don't have to be a martyr for your partner's sake. Doing things for your partner is of course part of being in a relationship, but don't neglect your own needs for "the good of the relationship." In a good relationship, your partner should be taking care of you, too. It's okay to be selfish every once in a while. The key is striking a balance between the two.

Okay, I've rambled on enough. I hope all this helps, feel free to comment or message me if you have any other questions or just wanna talk : 




 It's also really weird tho because a lot of the sweeter ones then say something casually that's super racist and then you just feel awkward; on the one hand they seemed really nice but on the other hand holy fuck that's racist. 




 Since other people already answered, I just wanted to say I hope you enjoy them both! Analogue really got to me, and Hate Plus was probably one of the better follow-ups to any VN I've read that wasn't originally written with a sequel in mind. 




 I'm happy that a lot of people are starting to recognize that fat-shaming is wrong, but it's really sad that as an unintended side-effect people have also started thin-shaming more and more. Any sort of body-shaming is not okay. It would be better if people could just keep their stupid comments to themselves. : 




 Ugh. So much ugh. I feel like I can relate, being asexual myself. It really sucks whenever guys decide to be total assholes just because you're not interested. Also, toxic people are awful. I would seriously consider trying to get that restraining order. Even if you don't think it will happen, it's worth a shot, especially since this guy is trying to get into all sorts of personal stuff about you. Stay safe, and good luck. 




 Yup. 




 That's awesome! Yay for good friends :D 




 I'm a senior (21, F) in college, have been with my SO (21, M) for over five years now. We both like anime, so whenever we went off to college together it seemed only natural that we both join our university's anime club. We hoped that we would meet some new friends and share our hobby with others; however, there has also been a lot of drama in this club, and just recently we were also sucked into it.

It all started about a month ago. A local theater was playing the latest Evangelion movie for a special midnight showing, and the club secretary posted on the club's facebook page that if anyone wanted to go, the club would cover the cost of their ticket - all anyone had to do was respond to the post and they would purchase their ticket for them. I couldn't go, but my SO thought it sounded like fun so he told the club president he wanted a ticket. President responded that they had a ticket for him, so he made arrangements with a friend to drive over together and everything was set. Or so he thought.

When my SO got to the theater with his friend, about 15 minutes before the movie, he found the club officers and they told him that they sold his ticket back. Of course, my SO was confused, because they had told him just the day before they had a ticket for him. But apparently, they had posted on facebook earlier that day that he had to reconfirm whether or not he was going. Since my SO doesn't live on facebook, he missed the message, and they sold back his ticket. The show was already sold out, so my SO didn't get to go and he and his friend both left.

Later he checked facebook and found the post they were referring to. In a comment at 8:41 PM, president had posted that if SO didn't respond he was giving away his ticket. For a show that night at 12. Seem a little unreasonable? My SO thought so, and responded in kind. Then the club secretary decided to rail on him, saying he was a dipshit, irresponsible, lazy, a dumbass, he's whining like a bitch, and that if he had merely texted the president this wouldn't have happened. My SO doesn't have the president's cell phone number, but the secretary did have my SO's, and by his own argument they could have just as easily contacted him. So despite secretary's long, swear-filled tirade, my SO politely informed him that perhaps they should all communicate better in the future, and that although secretary had the right to say whatever he liked, it really didn't look that good having an officer cussing out a club member on the club's public facebook page.

The club officers apparently didn't like this. President made a post (which was afterward deleted) saying that both my SO and secretary's behavior were unacceptable, and since it was everyone's club they would vote on what to do at the beginning of next meeting. SO had work, so he told the president he couldn't make it but would go along with whatever the club decided. Not that he should have bothered, since it was never brought up in meeting. The officers decided among themselves that they were just going to ban my SO, despite the fact that there was nothing in the club rules saying they could. They claimed he was banned for "disruptive behavior" because he made a scene at the movie theater, which he didn't, because my SO is probably the most shy, non-confrontational man on earth. Even then, though, his first "offense" should have only resulted in a warning - permanent bans are supposed to be given for a third offense. But they couldn't be bothered to follow their own rules and made up some bullshit, basically telling my SO that it didn't matter what he thought or wanted because they'd already decided he was out. My SO didn't have the time or energy to contest it with the school, so he let the issue drop.

I still thought the whole situation was frustrating and ridiculous, but I can't afford to make any waves on his behalf since I make a little money by selling handicrafts at local conventions. Two of the major conventions I sell at are also partly run by - you guessed it - club officers. Specifically, president and secretary. And I know that if I try to protest they'll likely find a similar excuse to ban me from their cons. Instead, I just stopped going to club.

To top it all off, one of the people I was friendly with at club who happens to work with my roommate told roomie that the officers have been gossiping about SO and me. As I suspected, they used a flimsy excuse to ban him because they don't like him. But it gets worse. According to the coworker, after club they were badmouthing both he and I at length, saying that because I'm such a feminist killjoy there's no way I'd put out for anyone, so my SO must be raping me. WTF?? Coworker told them that they went over the line, but they just ignored her and kept talking about us. I guess I shouldn't be surprised because I'm a queer woman and they've said some homophobic and sexist stuff before, but I honestly thought that we all got along well enough. That's what I get for hoping, I guess.

**TL;DR - The officers from our uni's anime club banned my SO on some bullshit pretense because they're sexist, homophobic jerks and the club is ruled by cronyism.** 




 Imho, playing the Sims without cheating is way too boring. 




 Oh wow, totally forgot about Perfect Blue. Shame on me! Lol.

In the Disney movie, Frollo really comes off as all yan and no dere, imho. 




 I haven't seen any. Then again I haven't seen many yandere in general. 




 I actually really like Sherlock and Light, though. I think part of the problem might be because women are often portrayed as overly emotional and way too needy, not to mention that women are often more likely to be diagnosed with various mental disorders, and the yandere subtype tends to feed into those negative stereotypes and perceptions. So seeing a character like Yuno that's just outright psychotic gives me a sort of icky feeling. She does, however, fit in really well with the tone of the series, so while I don't personally like her I do see why she was important to the plot. 




 I've always been weirded out by Yuno, but I appreciate her as a sort of antagonist I guess?

The rest I've never seen/read, except for Ranma, but I never finished that series so I guess I never got to that part, haha. 




 Honestly, if the character showed signs of improvement I would probably like them more. For instance, if they were super obsessive but you later learned about their back story and it provided a good reason (someone close to them died, or maybe they were abandoned?), and then as you develop the relationship they start to get better, I would probably enjoy that. Just like with tsundere - one of my favorite tsundere characters is probably Taiga from Toradora!, because as you learn more about her back story she's actually a really complex character and she grows and develops throughout the series. In general, I really just prefer characters that grow as time goes on, so if a yandere character were able to grow somewhat I'd probably like them. 




 No, orientation is not a choice. However, I personally take issue with the whole idea of the "born this way" or "it's biology" arguments. Of course it's highly possible that genetics plays a role, and there are probably environmental factors as well, just like with any other human condition. For instance, how do you know if someone will be an Olympic athlete? Part of it is probably good genes for whatever sport they end up in, but it also involves a lot of training. And of course, someone has the choice of whether or not they will act upon their orientation; some people try to resist their desires, because they wish to remain celibate, are closeted, etc.

To me, the whole debate about whether or not being gay (or any other form of GSRM) is a choice is moot. It really shouldn't matter if you choose to be gay or not. People should never be discriminated against because of their orientation, but rather free to explore their feelings for others without prejudice. Even if it was a choice, people should still be allowed to make that choice. If you ask me, as a U.S. citizen, I believe that our Constitution and laws are meant to protect peoples' freedoms, and if being gay were hypothetically a choice, the law should also protect that choice. After all, the law protects peoples' religion, and even though you have the ability to choose which religion (if any) to follow, many people consider their religion a core part of their identity, and people definitely shouldn't be discriminated against because of their religion. So why is not okay to discriminate against people for their religious choice, but it is okay to discriminate against people for their (perceived) orientation choice? 




 Well of course it eventually boils down to personal taste, but I just couldn't personally think of any (I haven't read or watched that many things with yandere characters to be honest).

I forgot about School Days, I started playing it but it ended up on the back burner so I never got that far in. Also, I thought Rena was more strictly a yangire? But I think Shion does count, now that you mention it.

All of the rest I'm not as familiar with, but I will check them out. My biggest issue is that the whole yandere archetype is based entirely upon the fact that the character is a stalker and likely crazy. It sets things up for an unhealthy relationship, which can be really problematic, but if it were written well I'd most likely be fine with it. 




 I was playing through Grisaia and since there is a bit of discussion in the game as to which type of -dere some of the characters are, it got me thinking. There are plenty of tsundere, kuudere, etc. characters that a lot of people seem to like, but I can't really think of any yandere characters from games or shows that I could say are likeable or genuinely popular. Can anyone else think of some? 




 Yes. The only problem was that the guy who fell for me was a total asshole, so there was actually no chance in hell that I would ever reciprocate and make his life actually better. 




 Like the others said, it would definitely dull your scissors. Not to mention I'm pretty sure that trying to cut leather (especially thick leather) with fabric scissors would be about as effective as trying to cut construction paper with safety scissors. It ain't gonna happen. You should definitely get some sort of specialized cutting implement. 




 I'll second this. There are plenty of poly people on OKC, and they have specific questions about non-monogamy (i.e., would you ever consider dating someone who was already in a relationship) so you can find out just from reading their profile if they'd be willing to try it out. Plus you can set your search options to "girls looking for girls." 




 I really liked The Royal Trap and The Second Reproduction, but [here's a list](http://visualnovelaer.fuwanovel.org/2013/07/list-of-all-english-and-english-translated-otome-games-via-otome-hearts/) of more otome (girl protag) games. 




 Yeah. I'm sure it's actually really common (especially if you're poly). Right now I'm in a committed relationship with my SO whom I've been dating for over five years, but I also have feelings for a girl I've been friends with since high school. 




 No problem, happy to help. Good luck! 




 I dunno, I think it would be okay if my SO already knew what he wanted to get in general but consulted the metamour for specifics. Like if he wanted to get me lingerie but wasn't sure on sizing for something and asked her for help. Basically, if he put the thought into it and knows in general what I like but she has more experience using something it would be okay. I've done the same thing for gifts I've gotten in the past - for instance, if I want to buy him electronics I'll often ask his dad or brother to help me narrow things down because they know more about electronics than I do and they know what would work best for how he wants to use it.

However, if he just asked her to pick something of course it would be cheating lol :P 




 Hmm. This one is a little tough. On the one hand, you and C seemed to have had mutual feelings at one point, meaning that there was (and might still be) a good chance of you getting together. On the other hand, C seems to have suddenly changed his mind. I would certainly want an explanation if I were you, so that I could figure out where to go from here - should you keep pursuing things or move on? Without more info, it's hard to tell.

Although H asking him about it may be able to get you this info, it's not necessarily likely. He might tell her the reasons (if any) or he might not. And it's possible that even if he does tell her that she will be sworn to secrecy and can't tell you. Although it might take more courage and seem a little riskier, it could be better for your to just ask C about it yourself.

Does C know about your feelings? Even if he was told indirectly through H, you should probably work up the nerve and tell him about it yourself. I would try to arrange some time where the two of you can talk face-to-face if possible so that you can tell him you like him and ask if there was any particular reason why he no longer reciprocates, as H seemed to think that he was into you too. Honesty and frankness can go a long way in these sorts of situations.

Perhaps C is worried about being in a queer relationship? I assume that this would be the case if you did get together since you're posting this in /r/askGSM. In that case, it's possible that he still does have feelings for you but is worried about the social implications of being with you. Or perhaps he's just nervous about being in a new relationship in general.

Of course it's also possible that he thought he had feelings for you but those have faded, or he's just too busy, or changed his mind, or whatever other reason people stop liking each other. But you'll never know until you talk to him about it. So I would suggest that you do that, and then go from there.

Let me know if you need any other advice, and you should update whenever you find out more : 




 The world we live in honestly sucks. I'm really sorry for what your friend went through, and I hope that your friend gets the support she needs, if not from the school or police than from friends and loved ones like you. I also hope nothing like that ever happens to her again. Abuse is really difficult to handle, and I know firsthand that it really sucks when everyone else tells you that you're making things up or blowing things out of proportion or it's really your fault.

I feel similar rage whenever I read internet comments on things like this. Sometimes I just wish that a meteor would hit every single asshole who's ever harassed an abuse or rape victim like this, but the universe is not that kind. 




 The above is only a few of the reasons I loathe the American education system. 




 Being pissed that someone gave you a disease is not slut shaming. Wanting your poly partner to practice safe sex is not slut shaming. Calling them a slut for wanting to have sex is slut shaming.

Your primary doesn't have a leg to stand on here. There is a difference between shaming women for their sexual desires and calling people out when they make bad decisions with objectively negative consequences. She has compromised not only her own health but your health, and of course you're allowed to be angry because of it. She's full of it, and honestly I would consider no longer being with this person. Clearly she doesn't seem to make your best interests a high priority. 




 Hmm. Probably not. I really like most of my guy friends, but they are not usually the guys that I would want to date, for various reasons. Thus why they are friends, and not people I'm asking out. There are maybe one or two guys I might consider going out with if they asked, but it's a pretty slim chance that a relationship would develop there. 




 If you no longer love your husband because he has substance abuse issues and is turning into someone who is scaring you, YOU ARE NOT A HORRIBLE PERSON. You are totally normal and justified in feeling that way. I'm sure he has his own issues, but that does not excuse any sort of violent or threatening behavior. Plus, can you really justify being with him for the sake of your kid? I'm willing to bet that being an addict severely compromises his ability to be a decent caregiver to your child.

My suggestion would be that your husband needs rehab (and also therapy). If he is totally unwilling to get help or change in any way, then you need to get out. Don't wait until it gets worse - cut ties now before something really bad happens. And you shouldn't have to give up on your bf at all - if he is supporting you in all this, I would say that you should definitely stay with him. He can probably help you with taking care of your son and anything else you need while the husband is in rehab or if you do decide to leave him.

That's what I would do, anyway. Whatever you decide to do, OP, I hope that things start to look up for you in the future. And just know that you shouldn't have to feel guilty for not loving someone who isn't there for you. 




 Agreed, to me ultimatums are a last resort only to be used when you reach your breaking point of things you are willing to tolerate. 




 No, I don't think that ultimatums are inherently manipulative. Most of the time when someone gives another person (especially their partner) an ultimatum, it tends to be because they have a really serious issue and they are tired of dealing with that person's shit. An ultimatum is less about making someone else doing what you want, and more an expression of "there is something seriously wrong here, and unless a big change happens soon this relationship will fail."

So at least imho giving an ultimatum is actually healthy for a relationship. It's a way for someone to express the problems they are having and making sure that those issues are seen as incredibly important by the other partner.

Of course, like everything else it has the potential to be misused - for instance, if someone says "if you don't propose to me within the year, we're done" but they've only been together for a month, that would be a little ridiculous. And I'm sure that in the past there have been people who have used it purely to manipulate others into doing what they want. However, in my experience an ultimatum is supposed to be a last resort. It's like having an intervention for your partner.

In that line of thought, ultimatums aren't exactly the same as having standards or "deal breakers," it's more of an expression of reaching a breaking point about what they are willing to tolerate. For instance, my parents got divorced a few years back. After talking to my mom about it, one of her standards would be that she wants someone who is emotionally supportive. A deal breaker for her in looking for a new relationship would have been anyone who is addicted to drugs or alcohol. Her previous husband (my stepdad) was neglectful and borderline emotionally abusive and he was definitely a functioning alcoholic, but she put up with these things for 13 years while they were married. She finally issued an ultimatum saying that if they didn't seek out some kind of counseling she would leave him. He didn't want to admit they had any problems and insisted that they didn't need counseling, so she left. Thankfully, now she is much happier and married to a new guy that has his shit together and takes care of her and my little sister. 

So I would say that issuing an ultimatum can definitely be justified, and no, just because you give someone an ultimatum doesn't mean you're trying to manipulate them. Sometimes it's genuinely because you want to help them, but if it gets to the point that you have to issue an ultimatum to your partner odds are there are a lot of issues there and at that point it's about as likely that you'll be able to fix the issues as it is that the relationship will fail. 




 Yeah, assuming that you like a good variety of games, there is always something free each month that you'll like. It basically pays for itself if you keep it around long enough and download enough of the free games. 




 I would definitely say it's been worth it for me. I'm a college student living with two other college students and none of us has a lot of money to spend on games, but PS+ has given us several good ones that we would otherwise never have.  




 He has lost some weight, which is good, but I'm pretty sure it mostly has to do with the fact that he's still in his mid-20s and can get away with eating unhealthy things because he still has a relatively high metabolism. But their dad has diabetes and the food he eats has barely any nutrients, and I'm just internally going "ugh" every time we go to eat somewhere because in another five or ten years he's going to start feeling the impact of his crappy diet. 




 Thanks. It's not really a full-on trigger for me, but I still am not at all OK with it. But I have talked to other people who it is a trigger for and I know how that shit feels so I really try hard not to violate anyone's personal space. :/ 




 I really liked that part too! It was certainly interesting. 




  I quite liked the mindfuck

Well I didn't really hate it, lol. I was just horribly confused. But as far as those sorts of scenes go it was nice ... ignoring all the plot holes and physics-defying, anyway, haha.

And yeah, everyone has their tastes. I understood the target demographic they were going for with Mink, I just personally couldn't relate because if it were me I'd be like, "Forget this guy." 




 DRAMAtical Murder isn't otome, but it is pretty good. Still worth a read in my opinion. I still haven't read Hatoful, my SO played it and he seemed to enjoy it but I just never got around to it. 




 Unfortunately, no, it's not. I've actually been wanting to make my own VNs for a long time just so I can add some diversity to the available market. But I'm a college student and I don't have a lot of free time for programming. 




 *Exactly* 




 I usually play the bad end first to get it out of the way. They're usually shorter, and it helps lessen the blow to my feels if I know that the character doesn't actually end up in whatever state of misery the bad ending puts them in.

Plus, it makes the triumph of the good endings seem so much better if you go through all the bad ones first! (see Higurashi) 




 Basically, yes. It's one of those things, at least imho. Honestly I probably would never have played through Higurashi if I hadn't seen the anime first and known that the writing was really good. 




 So, I'm not sure how popular this game is as I've never seen any online discussion of it, but I finally finished this VN and I wanted to see if anyone else has played it and how they interpret some of what's going on in the various routes and subplots.

Here are my impressions in no particular order:

* I'm a little tied between Koujaku and Clear as my favorite characters. I liked Koujaku almost despite myself. He's basically your archetypal heartthrob and the whole childhood-friends-becoming-something-more things is a little overused, but he was still a really interesting character. His Scrap scene was really intense. Also he had a really good voice actor, I think that helped a lot. Clear, on the other hand, was actually the first route I ended up on and I thought his character was also really likable and endearing. But his ending ... [](/s "the writers were pulling some real nekige bullshit there. I think they were actually challenging themselves to come up with the most depressing thing that can happen for this character. Right after proving how badass he is by stabbing his own brain and taking down the bad guy, he finally gets to be with the man he loves ... as he slowly dies and falls apart. I was cursing the game for making me cry during that scene.")

* I really don't understand the appeal of Mink, at all. [](/s "I get that they were going for a whole dom/sub relationship there, but honestly, it doesn't seem all that plausible to me that Aoba would want to seek him out again after defeating Toue considering Mink repeatedly raped him. Honestly, the only difference between what Mink was doing to Aoba versus what Trip and Virus do to him in one of the bad endings for the Ren route is that Mink is presented as a "good" guy. It seemed like they were trying to go for "yes he's a jerk sometimes but really he's understood you see because his whole family was murdered." I really don't like these types of characters, never understood why they are so popular. Having your whole family killed is bad, yes, but that doesn't justify going around raping people. Seriously.")

* Oh, and about that "true" route. [](/s "I was willing to let a lot of things slide in this game, but this is the point where I just threw my hands up and said, "WTF, Japan?" Aoba falling in love with his robot dog is one thing. I mean, it's not like the idea of love between humans and non-humans is new or totally taboo. It's in plenty of classic fairy tales like The Little Mermaid, or in modern fantasy like LotR or Eragon. I was totally willing to accept this at first. I just assumed that after the showdown with Toue, Aoba would build Ren a new, humanoid body or something. But then as the plot advanced further it was revealed that Ren is actually Aoba's split personality that somehow managed to gain an independent body. So instead of fucking a robot dog, he is now fucking the robot dog version of himself. I felt like this was stretching it, but even then I could have lived with the idea. But the thing that topped it all off was the good ending, how Sei supposedly dies and gives Ren his body. First of all, I'm not entirely sure how this is even physically possible. They never explain how Sei survived the tower collapse, nor how Ren is able to keep living on in his body even though Sei himself said that his heart was failing. Unless he was talking about his heart failing in a metaphorical sense? But I digress. Now on top of fucking his robot-dog-self, we are supposed to believe that Aoba will continue to have a relationship with his robot-dog-self inside his twin brother's body. Like, how on earth does he explain this to people considering the fact that everyone at the hospital has identified him as Sei? He is officially on record as Sei, not Ren. Does he just come home to everyone and go, "now I know that you all think this guy is my long lost twin brother, but really he's Ren, my Allmate, in a human body. Also, Ren and I are technically the same person. But don't mind us, we're just gonna go off and live happily ever after now." I really don't see that as possible.")

Well, enough ranting on my part. Despite my complaints, the game was really well made and I actually did enjoy it. I'm not sure if the "true" route is really worth pursuing, but the main four routes are all much better. Honestly, anyone will probably find something they like in one of the characters, and I really enjoyed playing through it.

TL;DR - too many spoilers to give an accurate summary, sorry :/ 




 Also from the South, and I've kinda given up on being irritated with this because it is so common here. Most people just say it on instinct. That I usually let slide because it takes too much energy to fight it. But it still really irks me when people call me "sweetie" or "sweetheart" in a patronizing way. That is definitely not cool. 




 As a fellow southerner I'd say this is pretty common. It still drives me crazy though. I've never been comfortable with people hugging me, so going to parties where I don't know a lot of people and suddenly everyone wants to hug ... bleh. 




 Ugh, I hate these things too. For one, I was abused for over half my childhood and I am always hyper-aware of people touching me. It makes me seriously uncomfortable. But even if I'd never been traumatized, it's still really stupid to violate people's boundaries like that.

Also, people touching my head without my permission is probably my single biggest pet peeve. I keep my hair cut really short and it's pretty fluffy (especially if it just dried) and so people just come up and touch it all the time and it drives me nuts. I DON'T CARE IF YOU THINK MY HAIR LOOKS SO FLUFFY YOU WANT TO DIE, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO WALK UP AND MOLEST MY SCALP WITHOUT ASKING ME. 




 As someone who is a picky eater (mostly because of tactile sensitivities to textures) I try really hard not to be that stupid with food. I actually do try stuff occasionally, because you can't say that you don't like it if you've never tried it. And if I try it and end up not liking it I just say "no thanks, it's not for me" and then everyone can move on. There's no need to act all ridiculous about other people eating things I don't like - especially since they could just as easily turn it around and criticize me for not liking things that they enjoy eating.

So yeah, when I meet other picky people that refuse to even try shit before going on and on about how they don't like it and then get all dramatic when you force them to try new things, it drives me nuts. For instance, my SO's older brother is literally the pickiest person I've met. His diet consists pretty much entirely of chocolate pop-tarts, chicken nuggets, plain cheeseburgers (and he only recently started adding cheese), french fries, and gold fish crackers. He irritates me so much because he absolutely refuses to even taste new things 99.999% of the time. But he's trying to be healthier and lose weight. I just want to scream at him that if you don't try to change then nothing will change, but everyone else in their family just makes excuses for him and enables him and I can't stand it. 




 No, they don't have to be exactly the same. After all, if we tried to put everything to a standard of being exactly the same we wouldn't even have common experiences between individual queer people, even those of the same orientation and identity and race and social class and religion and everything else. Because all human beings are different to some degree and have different experiences to some degree.

I feel like the comparison between certain specific things like you mentioned is a lot more valid, like the fact that interracial marriage wasn't acceptable but is now, so why can't same-sex marriage? That's a relatively equivalent comparison. But not comparing the entire queer experience to the entire black (or other person of color) experience, because once again this ignores intersectionality and how people who face multiple systems of oppression are going to have their own set of unique issues. 




 Clearly you don't understand how sexism works, and I really fail to see how anything you say is still relevant to the discussion at hand. 




 The only thing you will learn from whether your son likes trucks or Barbies is which toy he'd like to play with at that particular moment. 




 Good on you for getting far away from that crazy. It sucks that you have to lose such a close friend, but friends like that probably aren't worth having. 




 human semen contains prostaglandins, which are responsible for cervical ripening

That was the part I was talking about. That part doesn't seem to be in question. And in my summary I did say that it MIGHT help induce labor, not that it definitely did. I didn't really find all of the breast stimulation stuff relevant to the discussion at hand. 




 Biologically, yes, parts of my body are capable of bearing children. But that is not the entirety of my being or existence. Just like how yours isn't to go around impregnating women 24/7. One of the benefits of living in social groups is that people have a lot more things to do than than eat, sleep, fuck. 




 From my experience, people are willing to pay a little more for something that's personal or unique for them. So that line of thinking isn't bad by any means. 




 Technically, no, attraction alone shouldn't be a crime. However, molesting or raping children is a crime. Comparing being gay to pedophilia or bestiality is flawed. Many religious people have made this comparison to say that all of these behaviors are morally wrong, but children and animals are incapable of giving consent to sexual acts. Adult human beings can. Thus, two adult people of the same gender having consenting sex is not comparable to an adult that engages in sex acts with children. 




 Oh, okay, that makes more sense. I hope they enjoy their gifts! 




 I would hope so! Seriously, just because it isn't sexual doesn't make it less awkward or creepy!! 




 Although the comparison to pedophilia is obviously flawed and once again tolerance does not mean allowing hate speech, this guy's song did raise one good point - people really shouldn't compare the struggle that GSRM people go through for rights to the struggle that racial minorities go through for rights so flippantly. Yes, both groups have been oppressed, but not always in the same ways, and they are not the exact same thing. Not to mention that saying "gay is the new black" basically erases all the struggles that queer people of color go through. 




 Actually, having sex with fluid contact during pregnancy can be healthy - semen can soften the cervix, which is important because it reduces the risk of complications during birth. It might also help to induce labor, if necessary.

That said, if the idea makes you uncomfortable you shouldn't have to do it, and especially considering how it might impact a fetus you should make sure that you, your girlfriend, and the other couple all get screened for STDs. 




 But the Tagalongs are objectively better. 




 I'm a little confused. You said they were for Gryffindor, but the pictures look like you used purple and yellow yarn but Gryffindor colors are red and purple. Is it just bad lighting in the photos? Also I have no idea what the snake has to do with Gryffindor in particular as it's the symbol for Slytherin House. 




 Definitely! Randomly touching people is just not okay, period - it doesn't matter what gender or sexuality anyone is. 




 A lot of gay guys I've met (or that my friends have had run-ins with) basically assume that they're allowed to critique women's bodies as much as they want, or grope women whenever they feel like, because "relax, I'm gay! I'm not a threat because I don't want to sleep with you."

I guess a lot of them don't realize that just because they aren't attracted to women doesn't mean that they aren't potentially threatening. After all, rape and sexual assault isn't about attraction, it's about power. I'm glad that you realize that even a gay man still has some power over a woman. 




 In society women are treated as if their only important functions are to be a sex object or bear children. Otherwise, we don't matter. Just because a guy isn't attracted to women doesn't mean he thinks any better of them than a straight man.

Fortunately, though, at least some of them seem to be cluing into this and I've seen a lot of gay men speaking up about their own misogyny and how to end it. 




 Generally I try to come up with my own patterns for things. Sometimes I'll have close friends say "I found this pattern, will you make it for me?" and I'll only charge them a little extra plus materials cost, but I also sell online and at conventions. On my Etsy shop and at cons I won't sell something made from a pattern unless I get permission from whoever made the pattern. A lot of times in the pattern copyright the original creator will specify whether or not it's okay to sell finished pieces made from their patterns.

As far as photos taken from things you make, even if you didn't design the pattern, I'd say that's okay. It's like building a portfolio - you're showing off your skill and technique. To make a comparison, photographers make money selling their prints all the time, even if they didn't make the thing they're photographing (buildings, animals, etc.) because the part they're selling is the *photograph*, which takes skill and effort.

As far as pricing goes, for larger projects I usually charge by the week, medium projects by the day, and small projects by the hour. For instance, if I make an accessory that only takes about 2 hours to make, I'll charge around $15 (minimum wage where I live is about $7.50, I worked two hours on it, it's tiny enough that I don't care about materials). If it takes me a weekend to finish a scarf, I charge about $25 (estimating $5 for yarn and $10 for each day). If it's a bigger project like the pillows or bags I've made, I'll charge about $10 per week plus materials.

It's basically a sliding scale. I still want to make money for all the effort I put into something, but I also want to keep it from becoming so ridiculously expensive that no one will buy it. For instance, I once made someone a sweater for a costume. I probably put 70+ hours into that sweater. But I wasn't about to charge them per hour, as that would have become a $500 sweater. No one will pay that. 




 Honestly, I'd agree with the whole sentiment of "only they are responsible for what happens between the two of them." This girl's boyfriend does not own her - she is capable of making her own decisions about who she wants to be with. If he can't handle that, then perhaps they aren't meant to be together. But that's up to the two of them.

You are totally separate from them. What you do with this girl is not up to the boyfriend, it's up to you and her. Of course there are potential consequences for anything you do, but it seems to me like you're coming at this from the perspective of "If I act on my feelings for her and she and her boyfriend break up, it will be my fault." In reality, if she is poly and her boyfriend is mono, that mismatch will be why they break up, not necessarily because of anything in particular you do. Some people just aren't sexually or romantically compatible.

To look at it a different way, imagine if there was a man and a woman who were together, but the man realized at some point he was gay and although he certainly cared for his female partner, he realized he would much rather be with another man he had connected with. Would it be the second man's fault if the first man and the woman broke up? No, it would merely be an unhappy circumstance. People can't control their sexuality or who they fall in love with, so if this girl you like and her bf end up separating that's not on you, it's just an unhappy circumstance. 




 If you want to, and you feel comfortable enough, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't come out to your mom. It seems like a pretty good time, if she's already asking you questions about your orientation.

The best way I've found to do it is to just automatically take people to a website like the AVEN FAQs or the Huff Post series on asexuality, since practically no one knows what asexuality even is. It really helps if you have an official(ish) definition and more formal explanations about how this stuff works because people are less likely to brush you off as being confused or making it up to feel special or some other bullshit. Also, answering the same questions over and over gets pretty tiring so it's usually a lot better if they can get background info first and then ask you more specific questions. 




 Speaking as someone who's mom just recently got remarried, I know why you would definitely worry about your kids. I'm 21, but I'm the oldest out of three - my youngest sibling is 12. So far though, neither myself nor my sister has had any problems. My brother (17) has, but he's got problems with everyone in general so that wasn't surprising.

But I digress. What I'm trying to get at is that you'd be surprised how easily kids acclimate to this sort of thing. Assuming that everyone's kids likes all the other parents and kids, this sort of thing really shouldn't be that hard. It won't be much different than my situation. I have three dads now, basically, it's just that my mom is only currently with one of them. If she decided to get back together with either my previous stepdad or my actual dad, the only thing that would change is I wouldn't have to make three trips if I wanted to see everyone.

Basically as long as it won't cause any legal issues as far as custody of your kids, I wouldn't worry too much about this. Kids are really flexible, and it's not like they'll lose out on attention if they suddenly gained two more parents. They'll probably enjoy it. But you should certainly talk to them about it at some point.

Edit: wrote down the wrong age for my brother, I can't math today 




 Wow, that is kind of a shitty situation. And you're right, it's not really anyone's fault, it just sorta happened.

If it were me I probably wouldn't tell Ann just because if she doesn't really need to know I can't see a reason to make her upset too. But other than that I would definitely try to just move on and do better next time. It seems like Beth understands that you wouldn't purposefully do something that would make her uncomfortable and you wouldn't have done it had you known she was awake. So yeah, icky feelings and all that but you can't change the past, you can only try to do better and not make the same mistake again in the future.

My suggestion would be that if you are going to have Ann over again would be to perhaps find a way for Beth to stay somewhere else (go visit a friend or family maybe) or perhaps invest in a pair of ear plugs. 




 To be fair though, it's still pretty shitty to tell someone that's bisexual that they can't be bisexual because they're actually a confused gay or straight person. It's ok to be confused, and it's ok to be flexible. But you should never tell someone their identity can't exist because it doesn't fit into a neat little box. 




 There is a lot in that series that can be horrifically taken out of context, tbh. 




 I understand genderbinary stuff, what I never could understand though is how people also assume that you can only be straight or gay and there is no wiggle room. There have been queer people since ancient times who were accepted by the society they lived in as normal. Yet somehow people seem to have forgotten that. Even in modern science, though, the last fifty or sixty years of psychological research has been full of examples of studies showing the range of human sexuality. So why do people still assume otherwise? It makes no sense to me. :/ 




 I would say that there isn't really a problem with you attending clubs or events as an ally. You mentioned that you got involved with a friend of yours who is trans - I'm sure that person really appreciates that they have an awesome friend who will support them with this stuff.

To me it sounds like you're an average straight guy who is really comfortable with himself, as well as other people who are different from you, and that's not a bad thing by any means. I've had a lot of friends in the past who said that they were accepting of the fact that I'm queer, but they never really want to go to events with me or talk about it or probably even think about it. They accept my personality, but really my identity and community makes them uncomfortable. I'd be quicker to call those people phony than you.

As long as you don't try to claim you're something you're not, or go to events that are meant to be safe spaces for queer people only (support groups, for example), or try to assert your thoughts or opinions as more important than the queer people around you, there's no reason why you shouldn't help out and support them. 




 I feel you, teenage years are rough. I never came out to most of the people I knew in school, and didn't have much internet access either so I didn't really find out about other asexual people until I was already your ate. It sucks. Also, once again proof to all the nay-sayers about how "gay people have it worse because at least if your asexual none of the religious people are going to tell you you're going to hell." Yeah, right.

The good news is, pretty soon you'll be a legal adult and you can go away for college or find a job in another town and start over with your life away from all those assholes. 




 Whenever I first saw it this is basically what I thought. My interpretation was that she was genuinely startled by that guy and didn't really mean to kill him but considering she just found a pillow full of the hair from one of her father's victims it's totally understandable that she would freak out and kill someone who snuck up on her while she was horrified and hyperaware.

Although I interpreted what Hannibal said to her as "This looks really bad and people are going to assume you murdered him" more than "You just murdered him." Of course, it's been a while since I haven't rewatched since it aired. What Hannibal said actually made a lot of sense and he was probably right - a jury would have a hard time believing that Abigail didn't mean to kill him, especially considering her dad was a serial killer and the guy was harassing her and her friend earlier. However, he was also definitely using the situation to his advantage so that he could further manipulate and isolate Abigail. 




 I frequently buy ICEEs when going to a movie in the middle of winter. I have never once gotten sick. That's like saying you'll catch a cold if you go out while your hair is wet. Pretty sure there is no hazard since *you're in a warm building while drinking it.* 




 I can say that after playing like 20+ hours of Sherlock Holmes games these last few days that I definitely appreciate this. 




 I will admit that I often get confused by riddles. Lol 

Honestly though I don't know why so many people assume that if you're bi/pan you must just be confused or still in the "questioning" phase. Sure, there are probably lots of people who are confused about their sexuality but there are more than two orientations . 




 I don't know how soon you plan on having the surgery, but if it won't be for a few months you should probably find a psychologist who is trained in  exposure therapy and have them help her out. It's a really effective treatment for things like phobias or OCD. It would probably help her freak out less because she can work her way up to it rather than going from totally fine to nightmare mode right away. 




 Yeah, that sounds about right. 




 Well I thought I made that clear in my initial comment, but I guess not. But essentially yes, he was being an ass about it. I tried to simplify the story for the sake of space but I suppose that was a bad move on my part. If it helps, he also tried to insinuate that my not liking his "joke" was because I was PMSing, so yeah I think it's safe to say he was in the wrong. 




 I legit asked my SO to buy me a ring like [this one](http://www.titanium-buzz.com/piston-wedding-ring.html?productid=piston-wedding-ring channelid=FROOG utm_source=CSEs utm_medium=GoogleShopping utm_campaign=TitaniumBuzzCSE). He wouldn't go for it. 









 My main expectation across the board is that my partner doesn't try to pressure me or guilt trip me into having sex. I'm asexual; not only do I have a complete lack of sex drive, but I also take quite a while to get comfortable enough with a person that I would be willing to have sex with them for their pleasure.

Other than that, I really prefer that the person is honest with me about STD risk, that we always use some form of protection, and that they are willing to communicate freely about what they want from the relationship as far as preferences or potentially other partners. 




 Sure, I wouldn't mind. It doesn't bother me at all. I know that a lot of women (from what they've told me) sometimes feel insecure dating bi guys because they don't just have to worry about women potentially "stealing their man," but they have to worry about him leaving her for a man as well.

Really though, I've never been a jealous person and it's never been an issue for me. Plus it would be rather hypocritical of me to forgo dating a bi man since I'm panromantic.  




 Also, speaking as someone who lives in the U.S. South, the term has a different meaning here ... 
























 Well I should specify that by "like these" I mean articles that are about sharing experiences from people who are from oppressed groups about their experiences in order to promote better understanding about their group, or articles people write to clear up common misconceptions perpetuated by the media about certain groups. Here's some other ones that I thought were pretty good:

* [5 Things Movies Don't Tell You About Mental Institutions](http://www.cracked.com/article_20897_5-things-movies-dont-tell-you-about-mental-institutions.html)
* [7 Things No One Tells You About Being Homeless](http://www.cracked.com/article_20720_7-things-no-one-tells-you-about-being-homeless.html)
* [Mathematical Proof That The Media Is Sexist And Bad At Math](http://www.cracked.com/quick-fixes/mathematical-proof-that-media-sexist-bad-at-math/) 




 I have no idea why your gyno would say that. Yeah, using speculums and getting pap smears can be a little uncomfortable, but putting in tampons should never be painful. You need another doctor who will actually listen to you. I would suggest asking friends or family about who they see, maybe they can give you some good recommendations? 




 [Spoilers ADWD] (/s "Stannis' men probably ate it on the way to Winterfell.") 




 The first time I did it I think it took me like 6 or so hours? I was so frustrated, ended up looking for a guide, too. Really that level has absolutely no flow and gives you barely any cues about where you should be going or what you should be doing and when. Just poorly designed in general. 




 So it was over modding practices? Ok, I see why that could be a problem. I don't really want to open old wounds either so we can just leave it at that. 




 I'm glad that Cracked has started publishing a lot more articles like these. Unfortunately there are still more than a few not-so-nice comments, but not nearly as bad as I was expecting. Tried to correct a few people who were very adamant about how your DNA should dictate which bathroom to use because otherwise it's not fair to the cis people, but not sure if the effort was worth it. 




 Or you could, you know, just stop assuming people's sex based on their gender presentation. 




 A little off topic, but what exactly was the whole schism between /r/lgbt and /r/ainbow about anyway? I didn't start redditing until a little while after, so I keep seeing people mentioning it but I really don't get it since as they are now the two subs seem pretty similar to me. 




 Seriously. The only thing that could make that situation worse would be if the manager was also shitty about it. 




 Being open certainly makes my relationship with my SO easier. I'm asexual, he's straight, so if he can get sex somewhere else it really takes a lot of pressure off of me. 




 I've been pretty stressed out lately. In the short term, I just got back from spring break but my professors scheduled two exams and a paper to be due right afterward, which to me seems silly because the whole point of a spring break is that *you are taking a break from school,* not "oh you have so much more free time to study now so giving you twice the usually amount of work shouldn't be a problem, right??" Ugh.

Of course, I'm also having long-term problems because right now I don't have an actual job job so much as a I sell things on Etsy occasionally job, but our lease runs up in May and my roommates and I will be hard-pressed to make the money last long enough to make down payments and our new rent throughout the rest of the summer, even if I do get a real job. I just feel like time is constantly running out for me and it's really wearing me down.

Honestly, on days like today I sometimes wish that I could just quit school and work full time doing costumes and props and stuff and have that actually be a viable financial option, but it's not so I just have to tough it out. 




 I think that is probably the key. Sure, everything should be able to have jokes made about it, but whether you personally are knowledgeable enough about something to make an intelligent joke that gets everyone to laugh at it is a completely separate matter.

For instance, a lot of people get up in arms about rape jokes (and apologists for the comedians who make them). And for good reason - a lot of the jokes made are by male comics who have never been threatened with sexual violence. In their ignorance, their "jokes" merely perpetuate casual sexism. But then there are also quite a few well-made jokes about sexual assault done by female comedians that address the issue in a way that doesn't make anyone feel icky or guilty for laughing at it. One of my favorites is probably [this one](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t rct=j q= esrc=s source=video cd=1 cad=rja uact=8 ved=0CDMQtwIwAA url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJv5pjSRSLGQ ei=6CopU5HrBKKT0QGjnoCYBw usg=AFQjCNEL8ux845yL89JRK5UGUmXXFRdkwQ sig2=_usgXErvnWnZKN3c_iec1Q bvm=bv.62922401,d.dmQ) by Wanda Sykes.

So yeah, no one should be excluded from humor. But how you frame the joke and the person who is telling it also matters. 




 Well, I don't know about that - there are some people who are paralyzed and lose use of their legs but retain their sexual capacity. We have no way of really knowing though, since I don't think Bran has really gone fully through puberty yet if at all ... 




 /internet hugs/ I know the feeling. I'm glad your SO's family is so supportive and nice! 




 At the Chinese food place by my university campus I'm the "sweet and sour chicken with sauce on the side, white rice, and a coke." 




 Wow. What a pig. I hope he chokes on his chocolate. 




 I don't normally tell people what to do in their relationships, just offer options or say "well this is what I would do if I were in the same situation." However, in this case I will make an exception.

You should probably leave him. Sooner, not later.

You should definitely go see a doctor, and I would also file a police report (of course, if you go to the E.R. and it's bad enough the doctors will call the cops). Seriously, that sort of behavior is not at all okay. Not only was he being incredibly rude, but he assaulted you and in typical abuser fashion later decided to both apologize and try and shift the blame onto you. Don't fall for it. You are not at fault here, he is definitely in the wrong. He has no right to your property, nor does he have a right to throw things at you or hit your or kick you, and he definitely doesn't have the right to try to keep you from leaving. That's at least three different criminal charges. Do not take this lightly. You're not overreacting for being scared or confused. What he did was wrong, you were in an awful situation, and there are a lot of potential problems facing you in the future.

As other comments suggested I would also recommend seeking legal advice to see about separating your name from all the stuff you cosigned with him. At this point I wouldn't even consider the possibility that this is a one-time thing and you might be able to "work things out," this sort of behavior is toxic as fuck and I don't think I've ever heard of someone doing this sort of thing only once.

And again, I have to emphasize that you should report this to the police as soon as possible. Having the assault on record would certainly help matters whenever you try to separate your assets, also if you do turn out to be pregnant it will be important in determining custody.

I'm so sorry that you had to go through this, I really hope that you are able to sort things out and he never hurts you like that again. Just remember, your safety is the priority here - you shouldn't feel guilty about taking legal action against him. 




 It helps if you play something so completely different that you don't even compare it to Bioware stuff. For instance, I'm really into the Etrian Odyssey series. Not much in the way of plot, the main drive to play is the challenge and the mechanics. It's a test of your strategic skills. So naturally I classify it in a totally different category than DA:O which is more narrative-heavy. 




 Yes, especially if you can get the Ultimate edition. The DLC is a lot of fun. Although the Mage's Circle quest is pretty much the bane of the fandom, the rest of the game is definitely enjoyable. Also, the potential party members are all rather varied and pretty interesting and/or funny. I would certainly recommend it. Not my favorite game, but certainly up there when it comes to medieval fantasy RPG. 




 Yeah! More PSP VNs would be fantastic, especially otome games! 




 The last game I spent a lot of time playing with my SO was Rayman Legends. We both enjoy platformers a lot, finally beat all the main levels and started on the back to origins levels. 




 Video games. I still haven't finished (or even started) so many of the games that have come out over the past year, but I keep buying them because I know I definitely want to play them at some point (most likely whenever I go on break from school). 




 Because horn that is obviously old and magical, would be my guess. I entertained the idea myself, I will admit. Not really sold on it, though. 




 Also, his injury kind of leaves Bran in a bad position when it comes to inheriting his lordship/kingship/whatever title the Starks eventually get. It's not impossible for him to come back and rule, and there are plenty of other examples of lords who aren't very physically strong for whatever reason (Doran Martell, for instance). However, I don't think ruling would ever appeal to Brandon, and even if he did return to Winterfell he would likely give up his title and pass it to Rickon anyway. 




 I dunno, I feel like after reading ADWD his identity is much less built around being Ned Stark's son and more associated with his identity as a Brother. After all, he still has a lot of resentment toward the Stark family; as with Theon, he was never truly one of them, no matter how much he wanted to be. And any time he questions himself, he always reminds himself of his vows. The Wall is his anchor now, not Ned.

Also, regardless of what name he decides to take, I'm pretty sure he'll always be "Lord Snow." 




 The only contention I have with this is that Arya doesn't kill completely without remorse. Especially with her earlier killings, she expressed shock but dealt with it because if she hadn't killed someone she would have died herself. She also expressed worry whenever the Hound was bringing her to what would be the Red Wedding that after learning about all the things she did Catelyn and Robb wouldn't love her anymore. I'd say that's not killing "without a hint of remorse." She is definitely burdened. But she moves on and deals with it. I think the turning point is probably after the Red Wedding. For all she knows her entire family is dead, so she wanders around lost for a while, but becoming a faceless man is her way of building resolve. She's learning to accept death and starting to develop a new world view - although her vendetta against the people who have wronged her certainly hasn't gone away. 




 Yeah, actually, I have two or three times. It's not very frequent, and usually the dreams are pretty awkward. Most of the time the stuff I dream about is not at all realistic so I usually wake up going "well, that would never happen!" and laugh it off. 




 You need to have a frank, honest discussion with your friend. To be honest, even if she is bi, if she told you she's freaked out by penises you should probably stop pursuing any sort of physical relationship with her. Clearly, she is uncomfortable with it on some level, and while she doesn't seem to have a problem with other physical contact such as kissing she seems to realize you are attracted to her. If you want to put her at ease, talk to her about this.

If you really value her friendship, then show her that. Talk to her as a friend. Just tell her you want to clarify how things stand between the two of you. She's probably nervous about this and is afraid of confronting you. Show her that you won't freak out or get super angry or stop being her friend just because she doesn't want to have sex or anything like that. Just ask her to explain how she feels about you so that there are no more misunderstandings and you can both move on with less trepidation. Ask her about boundaries. What sorts of things are okay? What kind of contact is she comfortable with? If you establish boundaries and follow them, that will help put her at ease and build trust between the two of you, which is really important if you want to continue your friendship.

Hope this helps, good luck. 




  This isn't about asexuality, though

Problem is, asexual people are often treated pretty badly for not wanting sex, the same way that people will harass those who choose to be abstinent before marriage for whatever reason. I am 99% certain that if the post in AA had said that OP's partner didn't want to have sex because they were asexual, the comments would have gotten much worse than they already were. 




 I would suggest you have a conversation about this sooner rather than later. I'm sure that if you bring it up he'd be happy to talk about it, especially if you show how supportive you are. Just shoot him a text or give him a call and say you'd like to get together and talk about it sometime, maybe discuss it over lunch or something. It's not exactly something that should be kept private (at least from partners), so you shouldn't feel afraid to bring it up. Are you just nervous or embarrassed? That's okay, don't worry about it! It's important for people to share this kind of info with their partners, and afterward you'll probably feel closer than you did before. I'm sure he'll appreciate your candor and the fact that you're so open to an important part of his self. 




 I've only had one - same one, started off as high school sweethearts and now we've been together for 5 and a half years. 




 I think you win this subreddit. Probably the only time I have actually declared "WTF?" after viewing one of these images. 




 My only complaint was the font color. I guess OP went with red to fit the whole murder theme, but it would have looked better in white imho. 




 Well I'm not really sure why translation is an issue here, but whatever.

Yes, it is true that there are obviously going to be some changes during the localization process for any medium that crosses languages and cultures. Not everything can be translated perfectly from Japanese to English, and some cultural context is always lost. The best thing we can do in these situations is to find a decent cultural analogue for the new version.

However, I would argue that while some dialogue changes are to be expected and some minor changes are acceptable, but changing the core part of a character is not. Especially if you're doing it at the expense of a marginalized community. 




 Yes, it does happen. You're right.

However, I think it should also be acknowledged that as the character was originally intended to be ambiguous, it's a little alarming that they are being progressively feminized with each new iteration. At first there was no indication of Hanji's gender. Then the Japanese anime started using female pronouns. Now the English dub is using a stereotypically feminine voice. If the character looks feminine, sounds feminine, and is referred to as feminine, they can no longer be called gender ambiguous - Hanji is now being portrayed as female.

And as a person who also sounds naturally feminine but is more androgynous, this is kind of disturbing to me. They're taking a character that lots of marginalized folks could really relate to and are now warping them into just another average woman. Not that having woman characters is bad, it just sucks that they're taking away literally the ONE CHARACTER that people who don't fall neatly into "male" or "female" can be represented by. 




 I have no idea how this comment is even relevant. 




 Yes, but the author also said that they weren't supposed to actually confirm whether Hanji was male or female. To quote the people [translating the manga](http://kodanshacomics.tumblr.com/post/73207971230/hello-i-wanted-to-ask-you-guys-a-question-about-attack):

Isayama has confirmed that were not allowed to confirm Hanges gender. He has instructed us to avoid gendered pronouns when referring to Hange, or at least to use he AND she with equal frequency.

In other words, Hanji is NOT supposed to be a "she," Hanji could be a "he" or a "she" or neither, this is intentionally ambiguous, and to deliberately use an obviously feminine voice is misrepresenting the character as that defeats the whole purpose of gender ambiguity. 




 Well I can't definitively tell you because I'm not the writer, but the implication is that Hanji is not male or female but rather gender neutral. How it might be important to the plot or character I can't say because again, I'm not the one writing it. Maybe the author just felt like having a nonbinary person in their comic. And it certainly can work in English, although it is slightly more difficult to do than in Japanese it is possible. There are ways to write around it, the easiest to just refer to Hanji as "they" instead of "he" or "she." 




 I would say that the Japanese voice actor didn't sound as feminine. Slightly, but the English actor seemed much more so. At least to me. Anyway, the point is Hanji is meant to be more ambiguous, and even the Japanese anime messed that up a little - they used female pronouns when the original creator intentionally left out gendered pronouns. 




 Except that Hanji is supposed to be nonbinary, and they make them sound WAAAAY too feminine. So no, actually, they picked wrong on this one. 




 Ah, yes, because if we just ignore all the shitty people in our lives then they will all go away and everything will be happy sunshine and rainbows!! 




 My relationship is really similar in a lot of ways. I'm a female panromantic asexual dating a straight male. I'm not really that into sex, at all, but we still have it fairly regularly (few times a month usually). I'm generally sex-neutral, and although I don't get a lot of personal fulfillment from it, I still enjoy it on an emotional level. I view sex with my SO not as a chore to make him happy, but as something we do together as a couple - just like going to the movies or snuggling on the couch watching Netflix. I enjoy it because I'm sharing something with him.

However, it's still not as often as he would probably like, if he were to have sex as often as he wanted. And I do sometimes struggle with feeling guilty that I can't fulfill all his needs. But the important part is that we love each other, even if we aren't entirely sexually compatible. He doesn't mind that we don't have sex too often, because to him making me happy is more important than him getting off. He's never pressured me to do anything I don't want to do, and I appreciate him for it. I feel like this attitude is really necessary if you're going to have a relationship with an asexual person and you're not asexual yourself.

Obviously you recognize the importance of communication in such a relationship (although communication is important in any relationship). My biggest advice to you is just to be honest, about everything. Even if you're feeling something selfish, even if you think it might hurt your partner's feelings, you need to be honest with her, and she needs to be similarly honest with you. Don't try to hold things in for your partner's benefit; that can lead to resentment, which can easily kill a relationship. It's better to tell your partner even about the less desirable or convenient thoughts and feelings you have, so that both of you can work out how to deal with them together. 




 Honestly, if you don't feel the burning need to come out and you feel like it's wasted effort since you won't see most of those people again, then you shouldn't have to come out. Coming out is an incredibly personal decision to make. You shouldn't let what anyone else thinks influence that choice too much, because you are the one who has to face the potential consequences of coming out. If I were you, I would weigh the pros and cons of doing it. If you feel like there's not a lot of risk in coming out (which it sounds like you have a lot of support already from loved ones, so that helps), it's worth considering. However, if you don't feel like there is any benefit, or the risks outweigh that benefit, then you don't have to force it.

I understand how you feel about letting people believe you're something you're not. If you don't come out, you can feel sort of dishonest or awkward, especially when people make assumptions about you that aren't true. However, at the same time you have to remember that the assumptions people make abut you aren't your fault. Our heteronormative society is to blame here, not you.

To sum all this up, I guess I should just say that you shouldn't have to feel ashamed of who you are and everyone should be able to live freely as themselves. But you also shouldn't feel guilty if you choose not to share that part of yourself. At the end of the day, who you love is your business, not anyone else's. 




 Yeah, I took that test. I score somewhat toward masculine but mostly in the middle for masculine, feminine, and androgynous. Pretty much lines up with what I identify as; female sex but gender nonconforming. It's interesting because a lot of cis people never question their identities, despite the fact that nobody fits 100% into only one category. But then a lot of people turn around and judge trans* people so harshly because they don't fit 100% into a given category either ... seems rather hypocritical to me. Honestly, I think that gender doesn't dictate your personality and is totally irrelevant to what you want to do with your life. You just identify with what feels right. Why is society so hung up on all these silly details? Why can't we all just be what we are and enjoy the things we enjoy? /shrugs/ 




 Bi erasure is super shitty. As someone who is panromantic and in an opposite-sex relationship, I feel that pain. 




 Nope. I don't want my own kids, I'd rather adopt if anything. Plus, if either party changes their mind vasectomies are reversible. 




 Yeah. His family has all sorts of crazy drama and despite the fact we've been together for over 5 years, I still don't know half their names. Fortunately we only see them on Thanksgiving, Christmas, and the occasional wedding/funeral. So it's not so bad.

At the very least, I feel relatively okay with his dad and brother, just not his mom or extended family. 




 So ... take tampons with you when you go hunting? 




 I've never cheated, although I'm asexual and in a poly relationship so not only is there no desire to cheat I also don't have to regardless.

I have been cheated on, though.

Edit: I'm 21, forgot to add that. 




 NOPE I was definitely not encouraged.

I remember one of my earliest gaming experiences was playing Pacman with my stepdad on an arcade table at our local pizzeria when I was six. We played once or twice, but I found out from that how much he loved Pacman (he was pretty good at it too). It's what got me interested; it was something to do, and clearly it had impacted my parental figure, so I was intrigued.

However, my mom was really against me and my brother having video games when we were little for typical mom reasons (they'll rot your brain, playing outside is better for you, go read a book, etc.). We didn't have any game systems until I was 12 or 13 I think? We got a Gamecube from my grandma for Christmas. Mom wasn't happy about it, but too late.

It was soon afterward that my younger brother started dominating the game system. Whenever we played we were limited to an hour a day, but lil bro was always spoiled; when I was reaching my hour limit, he would constantly pester me (even if I had plenty of time left) and sometimes even told my parents I was playing over my time and they would make me get off. However, whenever he played it was "just one more level ..." until he'd been playing all afternoon into the evening and wouldn't even come down to eat when we called him for dinner.

On top of this, despite putting "I want a Gameboy" or one or two games after we got the Gamecube on my birthday and Christmas wish lists every year, I got tons of gift cards to bookstores while my brother got nearly every game he wanted (this was mostly grandparents' doing). Every time my brother wanted a new game they took him to the game store; despite repeated requests to go along or to be taken at some point they never found time to take me or ask me before taking him.

Also, at one point someone opened up a gaming store similar to a net cafe (pay an hourly rate to use their PCs or consoles and have any game from their library type setup) near where we lived. It ended up closing within a year, but despite this my stepdad found time to take my brother there three separate times. They didn't tell me about it until after they got back the first time; I asked to go with next time but they never told me when they were going, I'd always hear about it after the fact. After it closed I expressed regret at never getting to go and my stepdad made some comment about how I never told him I wanted to - I just sat there dumbfounded because *I told you every single time after you went to take me with you next time.*

Even to this day, despite the fact that I am just as much of a gamer as my brother, stepdad's side of the family conveniently forgets this fact and may or may not get me one game while getting a whole stack of games for my brother. At least my mom has accepted my hobby now; she actually consults me whenever purchasing games for my brother because he has behavioral issues and she wants to make sure there's nothing too violent in anything she gets. For instance, she usually outright vetoes anything with guns, but asked me if Assassin's Creed II would be okay Christmas before last. I told her how the ESRB ratings work, and how they usually specify types of material that might be inappropriate for certain audiences (cartoon violence, sex, drugs, etc.); with that knowledge she eventually decided that she wasn't going to get him ACII but that the latest Sonic game would be more than okay.

Of course stepdad's family continues to spoil him and bought him every single other game my mom went out of her way to make sure no one on her side of the family would get him because they were too violent. They basically get him whatever he wants because he's the only boy - they've never shown any sort of spoiling affection toward me, and my little sister (she's the youngest) still doesn't get spoiled hardly at all, especially compared to my brother. It's pretty gross. 




 As I'm not an expert on locks specifically I'll just speak on cultural appropriation in general.

White people (or any privileged group) appropriating from oppressed ethnic (or other) minorities is shitty because it's basically white people saying "we're going to vilify you for doing this thing, then take that same thing and wear it (badly) as a costume." For instance, the feathered headdress thing - First Nation peoples in the Americas have suffered from genocide ever since Columbus first set foot here. Native peoples have been enslaved, deliberately infected with disease, massacred, forcibly removed from their homes, and robbed of their ancestral lands, languages and cultures. There are still people alive who were taken from their parents on reservations and forced to go to boarding schools or live with white families where they were literally punished for doing anything from their original culture (speaking their language, wearing their traditional clothes, etc.). BUT YET there are plenty of people, white people, who have historically perpetrated this genocide over and over again and who continue to perpetuate systemic racism, who like to dress up like Pocahontas every Halloween or wear headdresses for fun or have offensive caricatures for sports team mascots. You see how this is incredibly problematic, right?

It's the same thing with black culture. Black people were enslaved, brutalized, raped, tortured, and even after slavery was abolished by law they were still exploited in just about any way possible by the white majority in the U.S. Despite all this, they have managed to maintain their own unique cultural identity and have produced many great cultural feats - in music alone you have the origins of Jazz, Swing, Blues, R B, Hip Hop, etc. all from the black community. Despite all sorts of adversity, the black community has developed and continues to develop. But white society vilifies black people for doing these things. If black people wear natural hair or locks, listen to rap, etc. then they're called "ghetto" or "nappy" or "thug." But when a white person does it, they are unique or worldly and people pat them on the back for being so aware of other cultures. Violence against ethnic minorities is still a living reality here and in many other countries around the world. The idea that white people can appropriate from other cultures in this way is completely unjust.

So to address your questions about what we can do about it, one of the reasons why cultural appropriation is so offensive is because white people stealing from ethnic minorities often involves a) stigmatizing the original culture they took it from and b) using whatever they take out of context. The headdress thing is a good example - usually, only leaders who have proven their worth to a community are allowed to wear a headdress in First Nation cultures; the asshat who buys a cheap plastic version at a costume shop and wears it to a party hasn't earned the right to do so. They are wearing it out of context. In other words, they're doing it wrong.

So I wouldn't say that making sure all ethnicities can wear something without stigma is the issue. The real problem is the context of how they wear it. I would personally argue that we shouldn't necessarily bar white people from ever doing any of these things; after all, a little cultural admixture is healthy and often necessary for continued development (example - Chinese plows brought to Europe sparked the agriculture revolution which then fueled the industrial revolution). However, most people I've talked to tend to agree that people should earn the right to borrow whatever it is they're borrowing. If something is merely a cultural fad with no important deeper meaning to a culture, borrow away. But if it has some sort of religious or other cultural significance, treat that with respect. Don't use it if you don't know the story behind it or haven't done what anyone else of that culture has done in order to use it.

Edit: Wow, gold? Seriously? Thank you kind stranger, I never would have expected to get that sort of appreciation.  




 Yep. I totally agree. I happen to be a woman who cross dresses and likes a lot of "masculine" things, but that doesn't mean I'm any less of a woman than you or anyone else on this planet. You don't have to be masculine to be male, or feminine to be female - in fact, I'd say pretty much everyone has some mix of both kinds of qualities, so even dividing qualities into the "masculine" and "feminine" categories is pretty arbitrary. 




 Not gonna like, Dr. Girlfriend is my favorite character. Second favorite is a tie between Brock and Dr. Orpheus. 




 Why would you wanna get rid of that talent? Lol 




 Not trans, but my roommate and close friend is FTM. He struggles a lot because he isn't stereotypically masculine, and I always that it was really awful. Just because you're trans doesn't mean you have to buy into every gender stereotype there is. It makes me really sad to see people say things to trans people about how they aren't being feminine/masculine enough to pass and that they need to change all these things about themselves to fit into society's gender boxes. That's stupid and shitty. If you like your voice, you shouldn't have to change or "fix" it! Just be you : 




 Well, there is usually a little bonding between protag and whatever heroine during the sex scenes, but it's not so important that you'll be confused by anything if you skip them. 




 Most likely. Will doesn't really strike me as the type to just thrash around and throw a tantrum; he thinks things through. I'm sure he's probably biding his time and focusing on doing what little he can, given his incredibly trying situation. 




 I lean more toward extroversion. 




 Yeah. I definitely don't want my own kids. But if I were to have kids, I would adopt some older kids from foster care. There are a lot of older kids, especially teens, that are less likely to get adopted and I would rather give one of them a home than have my own baby. 




 I dunno, I feel like you can only be super angry about something like that for so long. Considering how incredibly intimate and subtle Hannibal's influence over Will is, I think he's probably feeling more disgusted by Hannibal than anything. This man violated his home, his relationships, his body, and his mind. Of course Will would be angry, but I know if I were in his position I would be less likely to react by yelling or physically attacking him and more likely to just want to throw up and go take an acid bath. 




 It looks sooooo adorable!! I'm a little jealous : 




 That's only slightly creepy ... 




 I'm from the Southern U.S., for context.

1) Not very important. Generally, in my group of friends, you are expected to notify everyone else if you start dating someone new, within the first month or so after you start going out with them. We are all free to comment on what we like or dislike about each other's partners, but just because they don't get along with someone doesn't mean I will stop dating them. My friends' approval is appreciated, but not necessary.

2) For the most part, yes. Usually I'm the first person someone asks when they need relationship advice (despite the fact that they all started dating before me). However, it's hard to distance yourself from your own circumstances, so sometimes it's important to get another person's perspective. That's where my friends come in. I ask them how they interpret things to see if I'm totally off base or if I'm being unreasonable about certain things occasionally. Also, if my partner does something that frustrates me or that I don't understand, they can sometimes help me think about it in a different way that clarifies the problem.

3) Yes, definitely. For one thing, there are certain topics we just don't go into detail about when all our male friends/boyfriends are around. But also, if we know they're listening in we sometimes exaggerate our opinions or behavior just to tease them. It's all in good fun.

4) Yes. Most of the friends my SO and I have are mutual friends that we both know. However, there are still several people I hang out with that he doesn't, and he hangs out with people I don't hand out with too. Also, even among our mutual friends, there are several people who are better friends with one of us than the other. Still, when we go on group outings it's expected that I bring my SO along and we all have fun together, unless it's specifically a girls' night.  




 Every time I hear someone ask a question like this, my knee-jerk response is to ask "why were the Europeans so far behind the Chinese in terms of technology 300 years before that?" 




 Childcare experts pretty much agree that the best way to get your kid to behave is to put them in time out or take away privileges (i.e. TV time, their favorite toy, etc.) when they do something bad, explain to them that you're giving them time out/taking something away because they broke the rules, and then keeping those rules consistent and always giving them the set punishment whenever they break the rule. As long as the kids know what the rules are and what happens when they break them, and the punishments for those rules are consistently applied, they behave a lot better than if you just yell at them for doing something you don't like. 




 You do realize that flirting with someone doesn't automatically mean you've signed a legally binding contract with that person that you will have sex? You can say no at any time if you change your mind - anyone who then proceeds to have sex with you regardless is wrong. Drinking and flirting do not explicitly tell someone you want to have sex, it tells them you want to drink and flirt. Telling someone enthusiastically that you want to have sex is the important part.

Also, there are plenty of people who don't say no but are still raped. If you're coerced in anyway or were somehow incapable of giving consent, even if you didn't say no, it is still rape. For example, if a date rapist slips something into a person's drink. Or if they threaten them with a weapon or say they'll attack someone they love unless they agree to sex. Or if they are in an abusive relationship and don't feel safe enough to say no. Or any number of situations. 




 People who don't have/have never known someone with a severe mental illness. 




 Wow. A lot of that is seriously unnecessary rudeness. It's like militant atheists who tell anyone who follows a religion that they're "backward" or stupid or whatever. People have different preferences; the whole idea of fighting for queer rights is that EVERYONE should be able to express their gender identity or orientation freely. Of course ces/het people already have that freedom, but that doesn't mean that they're wrong for being the way they are any more than queer people are for being the way they are.

Speaking as a queer/poly woman, I can definitely say that if someone said the same comments to me every time I commented on a man's appearance or something like that I would be pissed. There is no one "right" way to be attracted to people. Saying things like "maybe you do have something correct in you after all" is super fucked up, because that implies that only certain sexualities are "right" and everything else is "wrong." NOPE sorry try again.

As for the whole idea of berating someone for being monogamous, I personally believe that people aren't necessarily monogamous by nature. But just like sexual orientation, that doesn't mean that everyone is a certain way. I have lots of friends who are monogamous and in relationships and they could never imagine themselves living any other way. *And that's fine.* There is nothing inherently wrong with wanting to have only one partner, the problems only start when you try to force your viewpoint on other people. Saying that everyone should be poly and that monogamy is unnatural is like saying that everyone has to like Neapolitan ice cream. What if you're fine with just vanilla, or only chocolate? That doesn't make you wrong, or a horrible person. It just means you have different tastes. Just don't try to keep anyone else from having Neapolitan, and everything should be good. 




 I'm 21 and met my current SO when I had just turned 16. We'll be celebrating our six year anniversary this summer. That's longer than most of my peers have ever been with someone; in fact, I'm friends with a couple that's married in their mid-twenties and we've been together longer than they have.  So yeah, I definitely get how you feel. Sometimes you meet someone and you just know that you want to build a life with them - it doesn't matter how old you are. 




 Well I hope that I've cleared things up for you. 




  If you have sex with someone doesn't that mean you physically attracted to them?

Not necessarily, although that is usually the assumption that people make. But in reality, there are any number of reasons people might choose to have sex with someone. Haven't you ever met someone that had sex with another person they aren't particularly attracted to because they just wanted to have sex and the person was available? Or what about sex workers who have sex because someone paid them to? I'm fairly certain that most prostitutes have had at least one client they weren't attracted to in the slightest, but they had sex with them anyway. 




 MFW I believe you when you say you're British because you said "series" instead of "season"

https://tattoosandtherapy.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/wasnt-expecting-1.gif?w=640 




 That's a fair point. 




 Yes. But at that age, a lot of kids don't even know what sex is, they just talk about holding hands or kissing, which is still a physical act even if most people associate it more with romance.

Anyway, there are different types of asexuality. The general consensus is that you're asexual if you aren't physically attracted to anyone regardless of their sex or gender. However, asexuals also separately categorize their romantic attraction, or sexes/genders they form emotional attraction to, and they are just as varied as sexual attractions.

In addition, there are also varying degrees of asexuality; there are people who are strictly asexual and never experience physical attraction, people who are allosexual (in otherwords, would identify as straight/gay/bi/pan/whatever), and people who are somewhere in between (demi, asexual-ish, gray-a, etc.).

And asexual people also have varying attitudes on sex; some of them hate or dislike sex and don't want to have it ever, some of them are sex positive and actually have a sex drive that just isn't directed at anything in particular, and some are neutral and don't care either way (I'm one of those). 




 Then that person would be a trans woman. 




 Well, basically attributing adjectives to actions is wrong because that's not what those words mean.

* Heterosexual: someone who is physically attracted to someone of the opposite sex/gender
* Homosexual: someone who is physically attracted to someone of the same sex/gender
* Bisexual: someone who is physically attracted to two sexes/genders
* Pansexual: someone who is physically attracted to all sexes/genders
* Asexual: someone who isn't physically attracted to any sexes/genders

Nowhere in these definitions does a particular sexual activity come up. It depends entirely upon your attraction. For a different example, how do you know if you are straight or gay if you're still a virgin? Because of who you're attracted to. What about people who are in the closet? Are you less gay because you don't tell people about it or even have an opposite-sex partner? No, this does not change how you feel. There are plenty of people who don't come out until later in life after they've been married and even had kids with someone. Does this mean they aren't really queer? No, it just means that they weren't acting on their preferences.

In that vein, I know that I am asexual because I'm not physically attracted to people. I've had sex before, but the act of sex is not strictly associated with attraction. It can be a way to express attraction to someone, but it does not determine attraction.

Saying that having sex means I can't be asexual is like saying that just because I've tried sushi once, I can only eat Japanese cuisine from now on. For one thing, it makes no logical sense because you're taking one action to its logical extreme. For another, it totally disregards how the person actually feels about what they did. What if I hated the sushi? What if I thought it was okay but didn't particularly feel the need to eat it ever again? Eating sushi once doesn't make me a sushi lover. Just like sexual experience doesn't dictate your identity. 




 I've pretty much known I was asexual since I was about eight or nine years old, because that was the time that all of my peers suddenly started gaining interest in romantic stuff and a lot of them had crushes, but I never did. I didn't really have a word to put to that feeling until high school, though. 




 Is it possible he could have flavored it with her blood serum or something? I don't know that much about brewing or cooking, no idea if this is actually possible, but the thought just occurred to me. 




 Being on the receiving end of butt sex does not make you gay. Being a dude who is attracted to dudes makes you gay. Actions do not define your identity, your feelings do.

As another example, I'm asexual, but if I have sex with someone that doesn't mean I stop being asexual. It just means I've had sex. 




 Actually KS came out in 2009 ... was translated to Japanese by 2010, at least according to vndb 




 Not first few, thanks, also yes it is somewhat general but I'm saying that the two games follow a very similar pattern. That's all. 




 The worst I've ever played? Probably [The Nettestadt Troll](http://www.renai.us/game/nettestadt.shtml). I didn't expect that much since it's one of those free Ren'py games that's essentially the equivalent of a bad fanfic, but this one is especially bad.

For one thing, the art is terrible. All of the women are drawn the same, just with different hair and colors. The backgrounds look like something you'd find in an elementary or middle school art class. It is thoroughly mediocre.

Also, the plot is super contrived and full of holes. It takes places in some random German village in the 1500s-ish. In the beginning the guys that are all your love interests get involved in some sort of uprising against the local lord, then there's a time skip and the village is being terrorized by a troll that threatens them with ... something (to be frank I don't even remember what the threat was). In order to appease the troll, the entire town decides to let the protag get dragged off by him to a cottage in the middle of the woods to be his sex slave. And then suddenly she is his waifu ... it makes absolutely no sense.

But what tops it off is the whole German thing. It's obviously made by someone who doesn't know that much about the German language or culture, because for most of the game there are no indications of such and then occasionally it's like the person who wrote it went "OH CRAP I NEED SOME GERMAN STUFF IN HERE" and it ends up coming off a bit like that scene from Evangelion [where Shinji climbs into Unit 02 with Asuka](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion#Asuka_Strikes.21_.5B1.8.5D). I think the kicker was when the troll is trying to seduce the protag and he asks her, "if I were a bratwurst, would you be my bun?"

At that point I about died laughing. It was pretty bad. 




 Ah, so there was some influence. I never saw any articles or anything from the devs of either game, so I was wondering about that. Perhaps I should do a google search and see if I can find some interviews with the Grisaia devs about it. 




 I know Yumiko's route did that, can't say for Makina as I haven't played it yet. 




 I won't lie, I really liked doomfest's art. I think it fit perfectly with the overall tone and theme of the game. That said, I also recognize the difficulties involved as an artist trying to adapt to another artist's style that is very different from your own. I think that considering the circumstances, you did a pretty good job, and I know that you will do your best to improve and make the art for this game to the best of your ability. So don't stress the community reaction too much, just work hard on making a good game that you can be proud of. 




 That looks so great so far! I'm really excited to see how it turns out :D 




 I already have resources for most of that, except for statistics/academic research (I need more) and famous people.

I don't know that surveying before I start will be helpful, at least at this point, because like I said in another comment I don't know how much time I have to present yet. We have the option to work by ourselves or in groups, so the time given will depend on how many groups there are.

I definitely plan on making a post with a general outline for my presentation before I give it, though. For the most part I'll probably be working from my own experience but I know that I'm representing the entire ace community as well and I want to a good job for everyone. So there will definitely be a chance for community input later on down the line.

As far as the questions, I've been asked a lot of weird things and I'm pretty well practiced at explaining this to people, so I imagine that part won't be an issue.

Thank you for all your suggestions and support :) 




 Thank you :D 




 LE GASP~~~ I don't believe it!! 




 Huh. Never knew Yahtzee wasn't into sex.  




 Lol I get mistaken for a man all the time on reddit ^I ^^wonder ^^^why 




 Yes. This happened to me quite frequently in high school, since I cut my hair super short and I dress androgynously. Then in college I got bigger boobs so it doesn't happen as often but I still make people wonder occasionally.

It doesn't really bother me. I like to cross-dress, so looking like a man is sorta the point. 




 According to the anthropology field, knitting is classified as a folk art and it totally a valid art form. But that "folk" part is probably the reason why most people don't recognize it as such - because it's not formally taught, people assume it isn't "real" art.

Next time someone says something about handcrafts not being art, you should tell them about the [Gee's Bend quilts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quilts_of_Gees_Bend). 









 Well like I said, it isn't entirely up to me - I don't know if there are any rules against it with the university (although I would assume not), and since I know I'll be fielding questions from people I don't want to record anyone without their permission, even if they will just be talking from off-camera. But assuming that those aren't issues, I know that I can rent a camera from our university's library so I probably will record it. 




 Aw, thanks! : 




 Thanks! I'm also thinking about recording it and posting the video online as well. Haven't decided yet, I'd probably have to get my professors' (and classmates') permission first. 




 That's a pretty good gif for how I feel right now xD 




 Oh, I had seen it but I totally forgot about it! Thanks for the link (and for reminding me) :D 




 Indeed! But I have no idea how much I'll include yet, since we have the option of working alone or in groups and the amount of time we're given for our presentation will depend largely on how many groups there are. 




 That's not a bad analogy, actually. I usually use types of food, since everyone can generally relate to food. 




 Yeah, I think that's pretty awesome that they added new gender categories. 




 I wouldn't say that everyone's SO needs to be their best friend too. After all, some people (myself included) need our own space and friendships apart from our SOs so we don't feel like we're becoming the same person.

However, my SO is definitely one of the closest friends I have, and I wouldn't say that's a bad thing : 




 I actually thought he did a really good job of staying in character and not being a total idiot about it. Also, by feigning (?) ignorance, it keeps the dialogue going and a lot of people who watch his show and know nothing about trans* issues probably learned something. 




 I already posted about this in another sub, but I just wanted to share with you guys since everyone here is super supportive and awesome!

I'm a university student, and this semester I'm taking a communications seminar focusing on TED Talks ). We started discussing possibilities for final projects yesterday, and we have a lot of freedom with topics how we format our presentation.

The whole theme of TED is spreading "ideas worth sharing", and one of the biggest things I think is worth sharing is my identity - asexuality. I decided I wanted to do my own TED Talk for my final project focusing on asexuality: what it is, coming out, discrimination, etc. I brought up the idea to one of my professors (there's two for the class) and I was a little nervous about it since I don't usually come out to people in classes. But not only did she already know about asexuality (huzzah for getting to skip the lengthy explanation!) but she also immediately got really excited. She thought my topic was a great idea and really encouraged me to go for it.

I've gotta say, I'm not used to this sort of treatment when coming out to people. I've dealt with a lot of confusion, some disbelief, and even some really nasty comments and hostility from people, but never have I been encouraged by someone like this to share my identity. It felt really good!

I usually dread finals week like most college students, but now I'm actually looking forward to it. I'm still a little nervous because coming out to a room full of people and then allowing them to ask you anything about your identity is a little daunting. But I know that my professors will have my back, and I hope that by doing this I can help educate all my classmates on asexuality and perhaps a little more about queer issues in general.

Thanks for reading :

That said, I still have to figure out how I'm going to arrange the talk. I was thinking about giving a presentation with an overview of basic info and then doing a general Q A session where my classmates can ask me anything they want about my identity, although it might be good to plan some sort of activity or something to go along with it as well. I have until the end of the semester, but I gotta say I'm really excited about this, everyone! Thanks for reading : 
























 I have the same problem with DA:O - I create a new save and I'm all like "this time I'll totally be with Leliana or Morrigan!" And then instead Alistair falls in love with me because I can't not find him cute.  




 That's really clever (and also super adorable). 




 That I will agree with. Most of the time rape "jokes" are just sexism or other such nastiness disguised as humor. And even though you should be able to joke about anything, that doesn't mean that if you don't handle certain subjects with sensitivity no one will call you out for being an asshole. 




 Wow, that's really ambitious for a first knitting project! Most people I know (myself included) did something really simple like a basic scarf or washcloth. A whole blanket is pretty difficult. But it looks really good! 




 I would say that you can make jokes about rape or sexual assault which can be funny, as long as they're not encouraging sexist ideas or blaming victims or any of that nonsense. For instance, Wanda Sykes did a pretty funny routine about having a [detachable pussy](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t rct=j q= esrc=s source=web cd=1 cad=rja uact=8 ved=0CCsQtwIwAA url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJv5pjSRSLGQ ei=pK5NU46fJMOhyATMp4LgDg usg=AFQjCNEL8ux845yL89JRK5UGUmXXFRdkwQ sig2=f8viZ9fhz-TyifeqIeXKkA bvm=bv.64764171,d.aWw). She's joking about rape, but not in a nasty way; rather she's using humor to deal with an unfortunate situation. 




 Yeah, now that I think about it pretending to be jealous about Sansa because that's how a girlfriend would react or even being actually jealous because she's worried that she could lose her sugar daddy is definitely a possibility. But turning down the diamonds seems like the exact opposite of that.

Also, with Shae refusing Tyrion's gifts that sets her apart from other whores, as if she is the real deal, his girlfriend who just happened to be a whore - unlike, for instance, the story about the whore who became their grandfather's(?) mistress and started getting uppity about it until they stripped her naked and marched her around Lannisport. But if she betrayed Tyrion for money rather than jealousy Shae is also more in line with this theme. 




 You might want to consider going to /r/polyamory or /r/nonmonogamy and asking them for advice, if you want to pursue an open relationship.

Also, I would say that you should probably take some time to really sit down with your boyfriend and have some honest discussion about what it is the both of you want. If he's lacking confidence, perhaps there is some way you could reassure or encourage him to try rougher sex. Otherwise, you can talk more about the possibility of an open relationship. Whatever you decide, good luck and I hope things improve for you both. 




 I'm so sorry this has happened to you, and I just wanted to say you're not alone and your family is being shitty.

For a good portion of my childhood I was physically abused by my brother, and my stepfather chose to ignore this. Even now, my stepdad's family constantly tries to guilt trip me over how I need to be a better sister and they don't understand why I finally got fed up and cut my stepdad out of my life. But I just couldn't tolerate having every conversation with him turn into "you're a horrible sister and you need to treat your brother better" despite the fact that my brother left me with PTSD. Nothing about this situation is okay. And nothing about your situation is okay.

No matter what your family says, you shouldn't have to forgive your father or even be nice to your father if you don't want to. What's most important is your safety. I'll never forget the first time I heard someone say those words to me - "if you don't feel safe around your brother, you shouldn't have to be around him." It wasn't until I was 18 and in family therapy that I was finally told this, and I remember finally feeling validated. It's so awful when practically everyone around you is telling you you're wrong for not wanting to be nice to or hang around the person who hurt you. If you don't feel safe around your dad, you shouldn't have to be around him. If you aren't ready to forgive your dad, you shouldn't have to. It's not about hurting your parents on purpose. If their feelings are hurt, it's not your fault - it's theirs for causing this to happen in the first place and then refusing to amend the problem. So don't give in to their pressure, because you have done nothing wrong. 




 Especially if it's for an animal, because they won't even get the benefit of placebo effect. 




 Like the doctor in Germany that tried to tell cancer patients they should give up chemo and take vitamins? 




 Also, checking an animal's teeth is one of the easiest ways to see if it's generally healthy - if its teeth look nasty or there are a lot missing you know it hasn't been taken care of really well, and the previous owner is giving you a bad gift. 




 I kinda wish they hadn't gone that route, though. You still got some of it in the books, but it seems like the show is placing a lot more emphasis on "Shae betrays Tyrion out of jealousy." In the books, though, I like to think it was all about money from the get-go. Like the scene with Littlefinger talking about how a good whore will make a man think that she is enjoying herself despite her expectations, I feel like book-Shae was just making Tyrion think that she fell in love with him despite herself but wanted his money and status the whole time.

Also, I think that this motivation is more in line with Tyrion's motivation; its basically the inverse of his first marriage. It makes his rage a lot more justifiable if he wasn't merely betrayed, but felt like he was lied to from the beginning. Finding out that Shae betrayed him out of jealousy would put at least some of the blame on him for not properly maintaining their relationship - it was a problem he could have potentially amended. But if she never loved him to begin with, it is yet another example of how the universe has fucked him over and he never had a chance because he's a dwarf. And that seems to be the recurring theme with all of his issues - I can't get anyone to love me because all they see is a dwarf. 




 Actually, this is why I usually prefer fan translations to official ones - often times the fans will deliberately put in translation notes that will explain puns and references and whatnot that the official english won't always do. Of course there are still a lot of official translations that are really good, but there is always some cultural context lost whenever you are translating so usually you get a more nuanced view of the work if you read/watch/etc. in the original language and you are very familiar with the language. 




 Chaos Life is such a good comic. 




 The whole virginity contest thing made me equally go "gross, those guys are awful" and "shit, this actually happens in real life and that hits a little too close to home." 




 No, I haven't seen it yet. I don't have HBO, but a friend of mine does, so as soon as I can get together with them I'll be watching it. 




 Yeah, I was actually really shocked at how well he does some of the characters. I'm willing to bet he probably does some sort of research or talks to people about this sort of thing. 




 Yes, and no. I was more like Arya when I was younger, maybe - I would stubbornly refuse to be put into a box. But Arya also doesn't face the same pressures that Brienne does because she's still a young girl. It's not uncommon for younger girls to be given more leeway in defining gender norms because they're still children. Once they grow up, though, if they continue to defy those same gender norms they're treated more like Brienne is. After all, half the time Arya is mistaken for a boy so no one questions her behavior. Brienne doesn't have that luxury; pretty much everyone is aware that she is female and they vilify her constantly for not behaving in a way that is more aligned with the female role in her society. By now Brienne is supposed to be married and bearing children so that she can assure her family's political ties and continue her husband's family's legacy. No one is going to blame Arya for not getting married and having children - she hasn't even hit puberty yet. 




 There is no reason why two bi people can't have a great relationship. If you're having problems, that shouldn't be the reason. Is your family hung up on some misconception about bi people being more promiscuous or something? Because that's just wrong.

However, if hearing about your boyfriend's past relationships bothers you, I'd say this might be the real reason you're having issues. Have you thought about why it is that him being with guys before your relationship bothers you? Is it because you feel jealous, or think that it somehow threatens your current relationship?

You should probably bring this up with your boyfriend and work something out. Tell him about your misgivings, and you'll be a lot more likely to work through this and find happiness than if you just sit and stew over your family's opinions about two bi people apparently being incompatible because reasons. 




 I really relate to Brienne. I'm a woman who's not exactly feminine, so I've gotten crap from lots of people my whole life for trying to be "like a boy" or not doing things that are "appropriate for a young girl/lady." Well screw that. I don't wanna be a "young lady," I wanna be me. And being me involves a lot of things that it just so happens aren't stereotypically feminine. So yeah, I can really relate to her struggles with not feeling like she's pretty enough or not having a place in a world that pressures women into being a certain way. And I can relate to a lot of the harassment she gets. I think she's a pretty well written character. 




 I love comics. In fact, I sometimes talk about comics so much that even my nerdy SO gets tired of my Batman tangents. If I ran into you reading a comic book in the library, I'd actually be more willing to strike up a conversation with you about it than I would most other books. 




 #44 bothers me, it might be nitpicky but they wrote Peach's name wrong.  When written vertically, the second character should be a straight line going up and down, like this:

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/oW8UqTh.png) 




 I really like kissing and cuddling. I also don't mind groping or making out. But I don't really enjoy full on sex that much, either. 




 I would certainly be interested. 




 Wow. That could have gone really, really bad. Glad that you had some nicer (and less ignorant) classmates! 




 That's ... kinda gross. 




 I would say that, at least from your description, it seems like you might be bisexual but heteroromantic. In other words, you are attracted to men and women but you only have romantic feelings or desire to have a relationship with men. 




 THE NEW SEASON OF GAME OF THRONES IS COMING and the premier is on my roommate's birthday so we have an excuse to throw a wicked party. Or just get drunk and eat cake in our underpants, whichever. 




 Nope. Not at all. It's just clothing. In fact, if there was a freezing girl nearby and he had an extra hoodie/wasn't cold I would consider it rude to not give it to them. 




 Oh, yeah, the Iron Bank will definitely cause some issues in the future. Littlefinger borrowing from them and Cersei refusing to pay the debt has put the kingdom in a really bad position with the bank. They've already sent one representative to hound people and collect their due, but I doubt they'll stop there.

Even if they still play nice, though, at some point when the war is over whoever becomes king is going to have a huge issue paying them back. I doubt Littlefinger is willing to help anymore - he's moved on to other things besides being the Master of Coin. With winter here there's not going to be a whole lot of trade, either. More likely, they'll go bankrupt just trying to feed people considering the war kept them from reaping the full benefits of autumn harvest and a lot of the fields and crops were seized or destroyed by soldiers from various factions. 




 And my point was that he would make a much worse ruler than Daenerys because at least she isn't totally psychotic and is willing to actually reason with people instead of demanding things because "I AM THE BLOOD OF THE DRAGON RAWR" 




 Dany: I am the rightful queen and the mother of dragons!

Random peasant: Well, I didn't vote for you! 




  Viserys might have made a better ruler if he ever got to be king

I'll have to disagree with you there. Viserys on the throne would not have been much better than Aerys or Joffrey. Don't forget that Viserys was abusive, manipulative, and completely self-absorbed and entitled. At the very least, Dany is attempting to learn from others on how to be a good ruler. Viserys just demands that everyone does what he says because he's a king, despite the fact that he's really a king in exile and his lineage doesn't mean shit to people like the Dothraki who live outside of Westeros. 




 I agree. If anything, I'd say that Stannis never won love from anyone. He was, however, able to gain the respect of his followers, which is arguably more important in some cases. Still, Melisandre is not particularly good at winning people over to his cause. 




 I really appreciated Sansa a lot more after reading her POV chapters. In the show she's pretty passive and is mostly just a victim to the cruelty of the Lannisters; in the book, you see that she starts to gain a will of her own and not only finds a way to inject small acts of defiance, but also learns how to play the game of thrones and become more pragmatic rather than depending only on fairy tales. 




 That's certainly an interesting thought. I'm fairly certain we'll see more of Braavos in the future, especially since that's where Arya is. But how strong is Littlefinger's connection to the place of his ancestors? I suppose we'll find out. 




  He was also sent off after he got Lysa pregnant.

Actually, he was sent off after he challenged Brandon Stark to a duel; Lysa didn't tell her father about the pregnancy until after Littlefinger had left.

Also, the problem with "create chaos to assume power" is that chaos is rather unpredictable. In the midst of a war like the War of Five Kings, literally anyone can gain or lose power at any time. We see it happen constantly - leaders rise and then die, soldiers change sides, marriages are made and broken. Your fortunes can change before you know it, for better or worse. One of the things that Littlefinger is best at is protecting his own interests, and creating a volatile situation that could just as easily get him killed as it could get him a lordship seems a little risky, even for him.

I won't disagree with you about his hatred of higher nobles, though. There is some deep resentment there. 




 Wow. That theory actually makes a lot more sense - especially since it would explain pretty clearly why Petyr says he took the virginity of both the Tully girls, not just Lysa. 




 I'm pretty sure that the Targaryens are the exception, not the rule. For one thing, there aren't that many instances specifically mentioned, but whenever it is mentioned it's usually a group of siblings all marrying. This was so they could keep their Valyrian blood pure. There was no need for anyone else to do this.

Also, you have to keep in mind that in a feudal society like Westeros, everything is based on carrying on the male line; having multiple partners confuses succession, even if they aren't simultaneous relationships (see the Freys). Considering the fact that they literally started civil war over succession, you can see why people might want to keep things less complicated.

Additionally, it seems as if everyone else is going with the two people in a marriage limit; even in Dorne, where some of the nobility have relationships openly with paramours, they still only have one spouse. Margaery Tyrell was married multiple times and there was a lot of emphasis placed on how her marriage with Renly was never consummated and therefore invalid; if bigamy was allowed, this would be less of a concern. And Tyrion also seems to think that his marriage to Sansa is invalidated by his previous marriage and the fact that they never consummated after their wedding. 




 So I finished reading ADWD earlier this week, meaning I am finally able to read all the posts on the main five books! Huzzah!

I have to say though, the biggest question still burning in my mind after all this time is ... what the hell is Littlefinger's motivation?

It seems to me that his most obvious trait is his ambition. He was humiliated in his youth because of his lower social position, and it seems he'll stop at nothing to gain more power (while screwing over people who were born with it in the process). So his maneuvering to claim a lordship, become ruler of Harrenhall, marrying Lysa, etc. is obviously a part of that goal to gain more power.

What I don't get, though, is why he convinced Lysa to poison Jon Arryn. There are only a few possible reasons I could think of to do this; it's possible he knew that Arryn suspected Cersei's children weren't Roberts, and did it on her orders/to curry favor with her. Considering that he also helped Cersei when he betrayed Ned, it could be that this was all part of a ploy to get on her good side.

But then we're still left with the fact that he basically instigated the War of Five Kings. I just don't get why he would have told Catelyn that Tyrion was responsible for the assassination attempt on Brandon's life. It seems like he's going through an awful lot of trouble for mere personal gain.

Any ideas or theories about what Littlefinger's really planning? 




 Starfighter was originally a webcomic which I just started reading, so I can't give a great synopsis, but it involves some awesome art and sci-fi goodness. If you haven't read the comic yet, you should check it out [here](http://starfightercomic.com/chapter_01_page.php?page=Chapter_01_Page_01.jpg). If you're interested in the Kickstarter campaign, I would highly encourage you check that out too! I'm personally a big fan of visual novels (essentially a choose-your-own-adventure comic in video game format), but unfortunately not many make it to the English-speaking market. Supporting projects like these means we'll get more in the future though, so I'm certainly considering a pledge. 









 Looks really interesting! I love the art style. 




 Yes, I do find other people beautiful. I don't masturbate, and I'm neutral toward sex. But there are lots of other aces who like to do both. 




 Yeah, that's also true. 




 Technically, though, she isn't - since Tyrion was already married to someone else. 




 That is very helpful, actually. I had no idea there were THAT many books. But this certainly gives me more info on where to start so I can finally break into the series. My best friend's family loves these books, so they'll be happy to hear about my finally getting around to reading them. 




 Yes. But that's exactly why I don't like reading it - it reminds me of when I was young and foolish, lol. 




 I figured it was probably something like that. I know when I read through sex scenes it usually doesn't phase me, but a lot of times when I see them in movies or on TV I feel really awkward. So I can relate. 




 I play a Rover, occupation is a Tinker, and I was at the inaugural game in Indiana for the Iron Fields. I also have an NPC character that is a Tinker, which will hopefully be used again in future mods. 




 Were you at the first game this past weekend? It was pretty awesome! 




 No, it's totally normal. I don't personally do it, but there are plenty of aces who do. It's just not my thing. 




 Hm. That would probably be a better reason to skip the show then. If you don't like watching violence you shouldn't watch the show. Also, I'll go ahead and warn you that some parts of the book have pretty violent parts too, so if you don't like reading them be prepared to skip over certain sections. 




 If you don't like gratuitous nudity, I wouldn't force you to watch the show. You should definitely give the books a try, though! 




 Ugghhhhh Daario is such a tool, I don't know why Dany ever liked him. 




 Never heard of those, will check them out though. 




 But there are also other ways to have more inclusive language. Someone else mentioned that instead of saying "ladies and gay men" you could simply say "people who wanna see hot guys," which totally solves the problem. 




 Well the scene with Jaime and Cersei that Brandon walks in on is obviously important, also I'd argue that the scene with Drogo and Dany on their wedding night was necessary (but they completely fucked it up in the show). Also emberspark mentioned Jon and Ygrette's scene, which wasn't the one I initially thought of, but actually the scene with Melisandre making weird shadow-babies was kind of plot important. 




 Well, that and you don't shit where you eat. He owns the brothel, it would be bad business practice to screw his own employees. 




 Yeah, I like that about it too. 




 I've heard a lot of good things about Discworld and have read some other stuff by Terry Pratchet (Good Omens), but never got around to that series as there were just so many books in it that it was a little daunting. 









 Yeah, this actually looks like it would be a lot of fun for the kids, and there are lots of psychological and physical benefits to having a harness like this. Any way you can improve the quality of life for a kid that can't get around easily on their own should definitely be invested in. 




 Also, so does Tyrion's. 




 There are at least two sex scenes I can immediately think of that are absolutely necessary to the plot, and another one that while it wouldn't be necessary to give screen/word time to would still be important to mention or imply that it happened, so don't worry, there isn't just a bunch of needless gratuitous sex for no good reason besides sex. 




 Doesn't she have dreams about him? Can we get sexy dream Drogo? 




 Porque no los dos? 




 I can drink to that!

http://photostock.newsmonkey.be/gif/07/03/75.gif 




 If you like fantasy at all, you should probably give it a shot. The books are pretty fantastic too - it's the best major series in the genre I've read about treating women like actual characters and not symbols or objects, which is nice. 




 I don't really know either, I was mostly joking. The comment was made in good humor, thus the little tongue smiley thing. 




 But that's exactly the reason why pan was coined - bi implies that there are only two categories to be attracted to, and it excludes people outside the gender binary. Although there are also some bi people who say they only like two, such as women and agender but not men, for example. But pan covers everything.

Edit: Also to address your initial point, of course people who otherwise identify as nonmonosexual should be included too, I usually go by queer myself. I was mostly teasing the person who made the original comment. 




 I imagine you would notice though if you had some strange new fabric rubbing up all over them that you don't normally wear. 




 Okay, that one was pretty good :D 




 Tormund Giantsbane would totally disagree with you. Also the number of sex scenes in the book is pretty high. Oh, and Tyrion talks about dicks and sex a lot. There is a lot of that sort of thing in ASoIaF. 




 Well, considering that those types of retreat things are organized for the express purpose of bringing brothers closer together, I'm pretty sure that the campfire would be a good time to come out if you're ready. It will most likely come up in conversation at some point - there's usually some opportunity to share more private things about yourself. Just take the chance when you see it.

Don't worry about saying specific words or trying not to cry. It's okay to be emotional - coming out is a huge thing! It's okay if you cry a little, I'm sure some of the other guys will cry a little too.

The best advice I can give you is to just be yourself. Everything else will work itself out, or you can deal with it later. 




 For real, that shit is not cool. They go so far to avoid showing dicks on that show during sex, meanwhile naked ladies everywhere (cough Littlefinger cough) 




 There is an awful lot of talk about breasts, but then Dany also talks a lot about having sex with Drogo, so I think that's more because it's specifically from her point of view so of course she'd notice her own boobs. 




 http://www.vmusic.com.au/Vmusic.Web/media/images/tyrion_dancing.gif 




 Well, as someone who is female-bodied, if my partner wanted to be breastfed by me, I would decline. I am not into that.

Not to say that other people can't do it, just not something I would be comfortable with. 




 There is so much penis with Tyrion alone I'm pretty sure he should be the god of dicks and wine. 




 Or Hodor. 




 He deserved to be poked fun at just a little bit, though. He does talk about dicks a lot, and he has been promising dragons for forever ... 




 Not really. There are a ton of dicks in ASoIaF. 




 What about all the people who are bi/pan? :p 




 If your "friends" won't support you in this, fuck 'em. The only way to make things change is to take action, stand up for yourself, and nail this asshole to the wall. You should definitely press charges, and I hope that the law is on your side. 




 Manly Guys Doing Manly Things is one of my favorite webcomics ever. It's full of so much awesome. 




 Wow, I can't believe you're doing such an awesome project and kickstarter! I love Rooster Tails, all of your comics are really honest and insightful and funny and all sorts of other wonderful adjectives. I will definitely be contributing.

Also, if you do go on an American tour, you should consider a stop in Louisville! It's a wonderfully queer-friendly city; the first place in the entire state of Kentucky to pass legislation protecting trans rights. I know that there would be plenty of wonderful nerdy people who would love to see you and read your new books. : 




 You aren't just cute. You are super adorable : 




 Or panromantic. Unless they're already familiar with GSRM issues (and even then) most people have no idea what pansexual or panromantic mean. 




 Really though, that bias is in all self-report data; people always want to make themselves look better, and will often change their answers to whatever they think the investigator wants to hear. 




 I really love the DA TTRPG, it's pretty easy to learn the mechanics and if you play DA at all you're already familiar with the setting.

I don't know if I'll have time to play, as I'm gearing up for the hell that is the end-of-semester-in-college experience. But if I get more time later and you still need people I might join. 




  My original belief is that he would have taken her by now if that's what they wanted and it seems stupid a nice guy like him would waste his time trying to get someone. And in this time he's actively tried and found another girlfriend and hasn't waited for her to leave me.

I'd say that's probably an accurate assessment. If he was really that interested, he most likely would have made a move.

And yeah, the problem probably has a lot to do with your anxiety. I know how that sort of thing can really make you stress out over something that turns out to not be a big deal. However, it seems really real and important in the moment, so it's good that you took the time to examine this. Introspection, even when overblown, can still be a good thing. Sometimes you just have to stop and assess your life every once in a while to make sure things are all on track.

Anyway, though, just letting it go is probably the best course of action here. If problems arise in the future you can deal with them then, but there's nothing horribly wrong going on right now so try to relax. : 




 To borrow your metaphor, yes, "board members" get to all have a say on what will affect the corporation. However, each board member is still an individual person - they only come together to make decisions when those particular decisions affect the corporation. But whenever they are spending time out of the office, they are free to do whatever they wish with their own personal life. And if one of those board members hangs out with people that another board member doesn't happen to like, that doesn't really matter because what they do in their personal time is separate from the corporation.

Sure, marriage does make you to some extent part of a "joint life," but it doesn't mean that now and forever you have to do every little single thing together. The two people who are married are still two people; no matter how much their vows say otherwise, it would be impractical if each of them had to ask the other for permission before stepping out of the house or going to the bathroom. And whenever you're in an open relationship, that means that you and your spouse have the "corporation" but everyone you meet outside of that corporation is a part of "personal time," unless you both choose to bring them into the corporation as well. In other words, OP's relationship with the other guy is separate from her time with her SO, since they aren't both dating him; therefore, she and she alone determines how to proceed with their relationship. Husband might not approve, but since it doesn't directly affect their marriage he can't just outright tell her no. He can merely inform her of his opinion - ultimately the decision is hers. 




 When you marry someone, you might acknowledge their opinion as important to you. But that does not mean they have a right to control various aspects of your life, especially if it doesn't directly affect them. Women aren't their husbands' property. It is not a husband's job to tell his wife who she can and cannot be friends with or talk to or whatever. 




 I dunno, I kinda like the sound of dr_fishy, lol. But yeah, I might change my mind later, just for now I want a break so I can figure out what to do with my life outside of academia. 




 Unfortunately :/ 




 Thanks. As much as I wish I could quit, I also know that finishing my degrees will be better for me in the long run. Although I'm pretty positive now that I won't be going to grad school, I'm way too burned out. But you're right, it won't be bad forever, and I only have to hang in there for one more year so it's not too bad. 




 They can hurt if you don't put them in far enough, but assuming you're doing it correctly (it's not that hard, so I don't doubt you are) you shouldn't even feel them while they're in there. So no, it is definitely not normal for tampons to hurt. 




 Yeah, I remember that one too. It was pretty good, even if it was super depressing ... 




 While it is possible that your bro's girlfriend has a problem with some of the flirting, I wouldn't say that the three of you are weird or wrong at all to have the close friendship that you do. As long as the three of you are all comfortable with one another, and there are no hard feelings between you, you should be able to do whatever you want with your friends, even if it includes flirting or talking about sex. That sort of thing is pretty harmless.

However, if you really want to assuage your fears you should probably talk to the other guy's girlfriend about it. Next time you see her, just pull her aside and say, "hey, I know you know how we are and that we joke around a lot, but we never explicitly talked about it, so I just wanted to make sure that none of that stuff really bothers you. If it does, we'll stop."

Don't worry too much about being assholes this whole time without even knowing it. Most likely, even though the other girl doesn't join in it probably doesn't bother her that much, otherwise she most likely would have said something by now. And if it does actually bother her, it's on her for not being clear about it - not your fault for not knowing her true feelings, especially if she went this long without saying something. 




 This seems like it would be a really efficient method for TPing someone's house. 




 Of course I do. I feel like an important part of healthy self-image is being able to laugh at yourself. So yeah, I make jokes about my asexuality with the friends I'm out to quite often. I think my fallback is usually whenever we're on some sort of topic about sexiness/attractiveness and I'm just like "I literally don't give a fuck." 




 Agreed - it seems to me less like K is too immature to be with OP and more like husband is to immature to be with OP. 




 I understand that you love your husband and don't want to jeopardize your marriage. However, your husband does not get to pick who you have feelings for. He can't control your heart, any more than you can. It sounds like he has all this misconceptions about K, and honestly he comes off as really judgmental and hypocritical. How can he say whether or not K is mature enough to handle a relationship with you? Who made him the love police?

If I were you, I would just tell my husband firmly but politely that he doesn't have any say in this. You're poly, you can date whoever you want, and as long as nothing really dangerous is going on (abuse, drugs, crime, etc.) there is no reason for him to intervene. He might not like K as much as you, but that doesn't mean he gets to dictate what happens in either of your lives. 




 Usually, yeah, they do. And yeah, at least half of them were somewhere along those lines.

Still, there were more than a few supportive comments, which was nice. And it wasn't so bad that it had stooped to the level of YouTube comments, at least. 




 I'm genuinely shocked by the number of upvotes I got for it, tbh. 
























 Dystopia rising player here. Just wanted to give more details. The staff are somewhat disorganized, I will admit, since the local chapter isn't even a year old. However I haven't seen much dickishness. That's my personal experience though, I've only been to half the games and I don't know everyone. 

As far as expense goes, it's $20 for your first game and $45 each subsequent game for an entire weekend of larp. Not sure how that compares to other games, but I think it's reasonable.

As a woman, I have never had a guy say anything threatening or rapey to me at a game. However we were warned that a particular player might come to our chapter who people have had issues with in the past; it ended up being moot since he was banned from all of DR before he got the chance. There are actually many, many women who are regular players at our chapter, and a strong lgbtq presence too, so it's way better than a lot of other geeky events I've been to.

In regards to safe time, the mods will tell you there is no down time. However, that isn't exactly true; in reality although zombie attacks continue well into the night the staff actually has 4am to 8am off so they can all sleep. There are no npc shifts during this time either. That means you can at least expect a few hours rest. 




 Who told your fiance she couldn't play a genjian because there aren't any Asians in Indiana? Fuck that noise. First off they're wrong because Toyota has a huge presence in the Midwest, secondly there are quite a few players with a character from that strain. Seriously I kind of want to know who said that racist nonsense so I can report them, I don't want that ridiculousness in my larp. 




 Cool, thanks! 




 Wow, that is really cheap for international shipping. I'm used to upwards of $20-30 for shipping from other countries. 




 Thanks, there are a lot of neat yarns on that site! 




 Ah yes, please tell me how the severe allergy I've had since childhood really works. I am perfectly aware that the lanolin is what actually causes the allergic reaction and not the hair itself. I know this because when I was in elementary school I wore a wool jacket and did not get a "rash" but rather a very bad case of hives - it was so bad my parents were worried that I might have shingles. My skin became red and blotchy from head to toe, and it was so itchy and miserable I could barely move. I had to go to the doctor and get prescription allergy medications to combat the reaction and the rash still didn't completely go away for almost an entire week.

Since then I have done a lot of research about what causes allergies like mine, what fibers are safe for me, and have tentatively experimented with various blends. I have had a reaction to as little as 13% wool, and to be quite frank, I am not willing to risk my health on a possible fix when it has such severe consequences for me. So I have stopped using wool altogether.

I realize there are some people who get scratchy wool and think they're allergic because it itches and allergies = itchy, however I do in fact have a genuine, diagnosed allergy and I really hate it when people just assume I'm some idiot who knows nothing about fibers whenever I tell them I can't handle wool. And as a side note, it's rather silly to point out the difference between the hair and the lanolin considering that we should all as English speakers know when someone colloquially states "I am allergic to wool" or "I am allergic to cats" that they aren't referring to every part of the animal but rather the specific oil or dander that induces an allergic response. 




 The pattern calls for 400 grams of one color and 250 grams of another, so I have no idea what the yardage should be off the top of my head. I could probably look up the Paloma yarn to get an idea though. I actually hadn't thought to look at Etsy, that's a good idea! 




 I did see that yarn in the store I went to, it was pretty much the only bulky yarn they had. I didn't quite like it though, so I wanted to shop around for some other options. Thank you for the suggestion, though - I appreciate it. 




 Alpaca should be okay for me. I'll check it out, thanks! 




 Hello, reddit. I'm looking for some help finding a good yarn, and I figured this would be the best place to start.

I found a really great pattern for a sweater I'd like to make before fall weather starts, and the pattern calls for Debbie Bliss Paloma yarn. The problem is, this particular brand of yarn uses 40% wool, and I am very allergic to wool, so I will have to swap this out for a different yarn that doesn't have any wool. I checked my local craft store and they don't have much bulky yarn; there was only 2 kinds, the first one didn't really feel that soft and the second was variegated but I would prefer a solid color.

If anyone knows of a bulky yarn that comes in solid colors, feels cozy, and most importantly DOES NOT have wool, please give me your recommendations! Thanks in advance :) 




 Okay, I have a question. I was abused as a child, and as a result now suffer from PTSD. I'm currently receiving treatment, but I would also appreciate support from other survivors. However, all of the resources for child abuse that I've found are for people who were abused by parents. I was abused by a sibling. Is there anything out there - legal help, support groups, whatever - for someone like me? 




 Today I realized that "get off my server" is my generation's equivalent of "get off my lawn," and that I am now old. 




 Definitely. As someone in a poly relationship, I am upfront about that shit if there is any chance of dating. If they want to talk to my SO, fine. Honesty is key. Cheating/hiding that sort of thing is so not cool. 




 Good advice! My SO and I haven't been spending much time together as a couple lately, but it's because he's been really busy with work and whenever he's not working I already have plans or it's pretty late in the day so we only have an hour or so before going to bed. We talked about this a bit last night, and we decided to schedule in some couple time Sunday. Don't know what we'll do yet, but it's the first time we've both been free for a significant period in two weeks or so, and I'll try to make it count.

Thanks for your input, I appreciate it :) 




 Well have you asked her about it? Because the easiest way to figure out why she's acting in a confusing manner is just to straight up ask. Honestly though it sounds like this girl isn't really worth the effort. 




 My favorite, ever since AFFC, has been Brienne. I really relate to her on a personal level since I'm also a woman who has gotten a lot of flack for not being traditionally pretty and daring to defy gender norms. 




 Oh, ok. That's not as bad then. From the way you told it, it made it sound like she started blowing you off so you then you started spamming the Instagram. Which would make very little sense. 




 I hope you all don't mind, but not many people know I'm poly so I just really need to gush for a bit about my new relationship! :)

I've been with my current SO for 5 and a half years now, and we've been non-monogamous off and on for the last two. He's dated a few other people, but up until recently I never have. Not that I haven't been willing, I just hadn't found anyone I was interested in.

Last week, a friend of mine from my RPG gaming group asked me out on a date Friday. We had dinner, saw a movie, played a few arcade games, and got drinks. I had so much fun! We really hit it off and decided that we both definitely want to continue seeing each other. Since then we got to hang out a bit on Sunday and again last night. And we have plans to go out again on Saturday.

I'm honestly really surprised about how well this is going. I didn't have the best of childhoods, and because of past trauma I have difficulty trusting others and dealing with any kind of intimacy or physical affection. But the new guy already knew about a lot of that stuff before we started dating, so he's been paying extra attention to make sure that he doesn't push my boundaries or make me uncomfortable. We're moving slow for right now, but I've been enjoying myself so much, and I'm really happy about how things have gone so far. And he seems pretty happy too!

The only downside to all this is that my SO is still uncomfortable with our relationship. I guess he was okay with the idea of me dating other people in theory, but for two whole years it was just theory. Now that it's actually happening he's suddenly having a lot of issues with anxiety and a little jealousy about my new guy. SO has always felt a little inadequate and has expressed concerns in the past about how I haven't dated anyone besides him (we were high school sweethearts). He's afraid that since I have nothing else to compare it to my evaluation of him is good, but once I experience relationships with other people I won't think of him as highly. Logically, he knows that I love him and he can trust me and I wouldn't ever leave him, but he just can't shake this irrational fear of his that I'll replace him with someone else (despite being poly means I can have both). He's gradually started to feel a little better as he gets more and more used to me seeing someone else. But I feel like we still have a little ways to go before he's truly okay with it.

That said, since I can't talk to my SO about it and new guy and I haven't really told anyone we're dating yet, I just wanted to tell SOMEONE. I hope you all didn't mind reading, and good luck with your own relationships!

TL;DR - I just started dating someone new for the first time since being poly and I'm really excited but haven't had anyone to share it with. 




 Just going on what little detail you've provided, I can tell you that spamming someone's instagram with comments after they're being mean to you is not going to suddenly make them change their mind. If you're getting mixed signals, you probably won't get very far with this girl. And in the future, you should instead just simply send one text or message saying something like "I thought we were getting along, what happened?" rather than flooding their social media with unsolicited compliments. 




 Usually I'll do Paragon on my first playthrough and then go back and be an asshole to everyone on my second. 




  The people I know all either play WoW, League of Legends, or Titanfall, none of which I'm interested in. And I suck at online fps's, lol.

You basically just described my life and friends. xD 




 I hope so. And I'm just the type of person to take things slowly in general, so he will most likely have a while to get used to the idea before things get super serious. 




 I'm feeling pretty good right now. Last night I went out with a friend on our first date, and in fact my first date ever with someone besides my SO. We've been poly for a while and SO has dated others, and while I had some interest in dating other people too I never found someone I particularly wanted to date.

On Wednesday my friend made a facebook post that seemed a bit gloomy. I texted him to cheer him up and he mentioned that we should hang out more. Before I knew it, we'd planned dinner, a movie, and drinks for Friday night. The dinner (and conversation) was great, the movie was really enjoyable, and I got a little tipsy for the first time (never had more than two drinks before then). Throughout the whole thing he was really great about respecting boundaries, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. We held hands, and I kissed him on the cheek good night. We both agreed that there would definitely be future dates, and we'll be hanging out after work tomorrow. I can't wait!

The only problem is my SO is feeling some anxiety and jealousy right now. I think part of the problem is that he's always had issues with feeling inadequate, and also while I could have dated anyone in theory the situation has never actually come up before. I've had two years to get used to him seeing other people, but me seeing other people is still new to him. We've talked about it a lot though, and I'm trying my best to be mindful of his feelings as I explore my new relationship. 




 Rumpelstiltskin is the best character in the show, in my opinion at least.

I've picked up and dropped a lot of games online over the years, but the one I'm always meaning to play more of is Torchlight 2. If you haven't heard of it, Torchlight was made by a lot of people who worked on the Diablo franchise. In a nutshell, it's Diablo with awesome useful pets.

I started playing it with friends but eventually they all moved on to other games and I was a little sad playing it by myself, so I stopped. But if I had someone to play with I'd most likely pick it up again. 




 Well, Wonder Woman is usually drawn pretty fit too. But yeah, for the most part it's all soft lines and curves. 




 I actually have seen Once Upon a Time, but I stopped watching it after season 2 because I had too many TV shows to watch at the time and just never picked it back up again.

When you get it, let me know what you think! 




 I really don't think that calling people out when they do something problematic is divisive. I think it's necessary in order for change to occur. If we just let things slide, society will never improve. If I keep doing something wrong, but no one ever tells me it's wrong, how will I learn?

How about instead of just writing off someone as homophobic (which is not at all what I wanted), we label actions instead of people? For instance, rather than saying "don't listen to them, they're homophobic," instead whenever someone says something problematic you can say "that was a homophobic statement." Because like I said, unless someone points out to you that you made a mistake, you're likely to just keep repeating that same mistake. And by labeling the action, generally people take it better because they don't feel like they're being personally attacked. 




 Yeah I don't know what they're doing with Jon's plotline either, nor with Gilly's. I guess we'll just see.

If it helps, The Wolf Among Us isn't just riding the vampire/werewolf hype train, it's based on the comic series called Fables which started back in 2002. The story revolves around the idea that all the fairy tales we knew as kids were describing actual people in other worlds, but their worlds were invaded and taken over by a mysterious figure called the Adversary. So now Snow White, the Big Bad Wolf, Prince Charming, Beauty and the Beast, etc. now all live in New York City.

So really the main character, Bigby, isn't a werewolf so much as an actual, large mythical wolf who uses magic to hide as a human and blend in with regular people. I guess that makes him more of a were-human? Lol.

As for what I thought of it, so far the game is pretty good. The animation is stellar, and they manage to reincorporate the "force you to choose between two people" mechanic from The Walking Dead pretty well. And I was a huge fan of Fables, so seeing the comics in game format was pretty fun for me. 




 Anything that runs off of the Ren'py engine should be compatible with mac. 




 Not wanting to see one or think about one because you're not interested is fine, but I know a lot of gay guys who talk about how they think vaginas are disgusting. Do you realize how fucked up it is for someone to just sit there and comment on someone else's perfectly natural body parts as if they were some freak of nature or diseased corpse?  




 I disagree somewhat. I don't think words like "homophobic" should be reserved only for people who do really terrible things, because honestly lots of somewhat problematic things over and over can really add up and cause just as much harm as the bigger stuff. And when people have this idea that people who are racist are Nazis or KKK members, or people who are sexist are the guys that beat their wives, or people who are homophobic are the ones who disown their kids and leave them out on the street, there's this tendency for us to think, "well I'm not a bad person, so I can't be racist/sexist/homophobic/etc." But in reality anyone can be prejudiced, even if they're an otherwise good person. 




 Just because someone is old and religious doesn't mean that saying gay people kissing is gross doesn't make it any less homophobic, though. Nobody should get a free pass on bigotry just because you can't convince them to stop being assholes. 




 Well the point of the article wasn't if you find PDA offensive or uncomfortable, just that it's homophobic if you ONLY find gay couples (especially gay men) kissing to be disgusting *purely because they are gay.* Not liking PDA in general is not homophobia. No one claimed it was. 




 I really love Pod and Brienne, too! They have great chemistry together, and I bet they'll be good friends later on. And there are definitely some good changes the show has made. For instance, I liked how they redid Tyrion's wedding to make Joffrey into more of a complete sadistic creep. Because no one can be mad at them for making Joff more evil, lol.

OMG I love The Walking Dead!! You HAVE to finish it. The ending is so worth it! Also, if you liked that one you should also give The Wolf Among Us a try - it's less jump-scare prone. 




 FYI profiling is not nearly as glamorous (nor as easy) as the show makes it look. Becoming a profiler doesn't make you magically able to know everything about someone just by looking around a room they've been in. And it's not an exact science. But if you're interested in the subject, you should look at the FBI's website and search for books authored by former or current profilers. 




 That's probably the best use of that gif that I've seen on Reddit yet. 




 I've heard good things about Origins, never been though.

I totally understand why those scenes would be off-putting. Honestly the Dany/Drogo scene was a really terrible one. The show changes a lot of the romance scenes purely for shock value and ratings, which I hate so much. I basically just watch the show for Tyrion, Arya, and Brienne. I like the books a lot more, too.

I've been playing through quite a few VNs lately. Some of my favorites are Katawa Shoujo, Higurashi, and Dangan Ronpa. If you haven't played them, Katawa Shoujo is free, and Dangan Ronpa came out for PSP (and the sequel is on the Vita). Higurashi is a little harder to find, and is a bit expensive pretty much anywhere you do find it, unfortunately. 




 Yeah, my best advice would be to just treat LGBT couples like any of your other couples. 




 I'm from the southern US, they still say it in over half the ceremonies I've been to (which is a lot, since I have a large family). 




 First off, you need to realize that asexual does not mean "low sex drive/never wants sex." There are plenty of asexual people that have higher libidos and enjoy sex. A person is asexual if they do not experience sexual attraction, but over half of asexual people surveyed masturbate and plenty have sex with their partners. So there's no reason to think that your SO isn't asexual simply because of libido.

That aside, it seems like she is having some issues with her faith. It's hard to say more without more details, but it's possible she's just confused and trying to figure herself out. In that case, you should probably talk things over, maybe give her some space until she's more sure of herself. 




 I have gone to Ohayocon once, but I can't make that one of my regular cons unfortunately since I moved a little further away and that would now be a minimum of 3 hours of driving, assuming there is no traffic. For a long time my regular con has been Sugoicon, but I skipped last year after hearing about the attendee limit and the date coinciding with 3 other cons, once of which was closer to me anyway.

What sold me on the show was Sean Bean playing Ned Stark. I couldn't get over the Boromir feels induced by them basically casting him in the exact same role. And dying. Again. The one good thing I got from watching the show first was that I already knew who all the major characters were, so it was easier to keep track of people since I didn't have to learn a whole bunch of new names all at once.

If you do, you should definitely subscribe to /r/crochet and post pics of your projects! I would love to see them :)

It has kept me rather busy. I have to spend an extra year in undergrad to finish both degrees.

As far as how I became interested in those subjects, I have pretty much always had an interest in psychology. This was partly driven by the fact that many of my family members (as well as myself) have mental disorders, and partly because I like to know how things work and psychology is essentially the study of what makes people tick. I did a lot of reading on the subject in high school, and decided to major in psychology whenever I got to college.

Anthropology, on the other hand, wasn't something I planned on doing. I loved archaeology as a kid. I was fascinated with dinosaurs when I was really little, and loved studying ancient Egypt; in fourth and fifth grade I read Greek and Roman mythology for fun while the rest of my classmates were enchanted by Harry Potter. But after middle school I started getting into other things and mostly lost interest. Once I got to college, I took the two intro anthropology classes for general education requirements (cultural anthropology counted toward cultural diversity and biological anthropology fulfilled a science requirement). Then while going over my school schedule with a friend, I mentioned how interesting all the anthropology classes looked and it was a shame they wouldn't count for anything since I wasn't an anthropology major. My friend responded by saying, "well why don't you become an anthropology major?" And then I did. 




 Just a thought, but perhaps his tan is also meant to emphasize how Oberyn has done a lot of traveling to places where people have darker skin? I mean, if you go on a trip to someplace closer to the equator you're going to come back with a tan, and he did say he spent 5 years in Lys. It seemed logical that someone who's traveled to a lot of sunny places would be more tan. 




 I don't take him seriously anyway, frankly. 




 Speaking of hair dye, why haven't they dyed Sansa's hair? 




 When discussing this with my roommate, he commented that it was probably because they were giving screen time to Renly and Loras purely for ratings, not for character development. I think I agree with his assessment; lack of follow-through suggests those scenes were only there in the first place because "LOOK GAYS PAY ATTENTION CONTROVERSY."

I think this also goes along with how they changed scenes with Dany/Drogo and Jaime/Cersei by removing Dany and Cersei actually being pleasured by their partners and instead decided to make the scenes non-consensual and rapey. They just want to stir up controversy. 




 I need to reread that book ... I haven't touched it since middle school, waaaay too long ago. 




 I have! They are so much fun! I usually go to the Ohio Renaissance Festival. My friends and I used to go every year until I moved away for college, although I went again for the first time in a couple of years last summer and it was pretty awesome.

Oh god, I can't even imagine having to stop halfway through because of the Red Wedding. I watched the third season of the show and then read all the books while waiting for the first season so I already knew it was coming, but it was still heartbreaking to read. I did hear about the Red Wedding before watching the show, but similar to you I only vaguely knew it was probably a bad thing that happened. But I was in no way prepared for the bloodbath.

 I wish I had the patience to learn

This is one of the most common things people tell me whenever I mention I know how. I got good at it by doing it in my free time while waiting in between classes or while in waiting rooms at the doctors or in the car, etc. Also, YouTube is super helpful if you forget how to do a stitch. As far as finishing craft projects, you can look for a book called One Skein Wonders - it has a bunch of super short projects that take maybe an afternoon or two to finish and don't need much yarn, so you can make an entire thing in relatively little time. Otherwise I don't really know of a way to help finish more projects as I have the same problem about not finishing things sometimes ;P

I'm double majoring in Psychology and Anthropology, with a minor in Asian Studies. 




 Cas is basically the best part of that entire plot arc. 




 That is one of my favorite quotes from Supernatural. 




 That sounds like a lot of fun! And yeah, copying something is really difficult. But if you mess up making your own thing, you can always just write it off as "I meant to do that."

You just finished A Clash of Kings? Awesome. How did you enjoy all the weddings? Lol

I do a lot of needlework, so I knit and crochet things like plushies, bags, some jewelry, and other accessories. 




 I used to read a lot more, although since I started college I've been doing a lot less reading for pleasure and a lot more reading textbooks and research articles. As far as what I have been reading, I just finished A Dance With Dragons, and I started this YA series called The Frost Chronicles just for fun. I also read manga sometimes, but haven't been doing much of that at all.

I, too, have a problem with finishing games. Especially if I get stuck. I have quit playing so many games because I can't figure out what I'm supposed to do but I'm too stubborn to look up a guide.

If you want to get into cosplay, I would suggest starting simple. There are plenty of options for found-item costumes, where you basically purchase pieces here and there to put together an outfit. It costs a bit more, but it's easier than trying to make an entire outfit from scratch. Once you start making outfits, it helps to know a bit of sewing, although I've also used knitting, crochet, and papercraft for some of my costumes. Additionally, sculpting skills come in handy, and some people even do leather or metalworking. But that all comes later. Just start small and work your way up. Most people are really nice and will give you plenty of good pointers to help you improve :

I've been trying to go to more cons lately, although the last couple of cons I went to I was selling stuff in Artist Alley so I didn't get a chance to look around much. 




 Cool! What kind of hobbies are you into? 




 Considering your brother is still rather young, I don't think it's impossible to change his mind. Try explaining it to him another way. Ask him how he would feel if someone told him that he couldn't be friends with or like other boys. Would that be reasonable? No. Who you like and become friends with has nothing to do with sex or gender. It is the same way with love. Romantic partners shouldn't be limited; people can fall in love with anyone they like and they shouldn't be made fun of or persecuted because of it. 




 While I definitely understand while your partner and meta are offended and upset about her not being invited, I think you're probably right in this situation. Your family shouldn't have to invite meta. It would be one thing if you were the point in this V and they invited one of your partners but not the other.

However, in this scenario, there are three degrees of separation between the marrying couple and meta. Inviting your sister to your wedding is standard. Inviting your sister's partner is to be expected. Inviting your sister's partner's date? That's a bit of a stretch, even if you are poly-friendly. If I were in the position your brother is in, I would be like "it's great you're in this relationship and all but I barely know this person and have no connection to them, and my future wife doesn't know them either, so why should we invite them to our wedding?" She might be important to you and your partner, but that doesn't mean she has to be important to any of the other people you know. And if they invited everyone they had such a tenuous relationship with, the guest list would soon be ridiculously long.

Honestly, I think your partner and meta should probably just let this one go. This event isn't about them, it's about the couple getting married, and who they want to celebrate with at their wedding. There are family members who I haven't been invited when they got married, but we still see each other at other family functions. I would be more offended if the family didn't want to invite her to Thanksgiving or a reunion or something. So focus having your family get to know meta better, and I'm sure they'll start inviting her to more things in the future as they get to know her and start to warm up more to your relationship. 




 It does feel really good to be able to laugh with someone. 




 I really love when my SO gives me a backrub. Not only is massage really close physical contact, it's also a good way to show someone you care for them and want to ensure their health and well being. 




 If it makes you feel any better, this treatment was considered relatively humane compared to techniques from a few decades earlier. For instance, filling people's skulls with ethanol, yanking out their teeth, or removing large portions of their intestines.

For more info about how terrifying psychological practices were at the turn of the 20th century, I recommend *Madhouse* by Andrew Scull.  




 I'm just glad that this time around they didn't turn a character who was socially incompetent/crazy/robot/alien/otherwise misanthropic into an asexual character - e.g., Sherlock, Sheldon Cooper, Yuki Nagato, The Doctor, etc. 




 Who you are or aren't attracted to has nothing to do with your genitalia. See: any queer person ever. Also, I'm pretty sure any fan of GoT would know that Varys is a eunuch, but thanks for stating the fucking obvious. 




 Eunuchs can still experience attraction. Just because you don't have a penis anymore doesn't mean you can't wish you did. 




 It doesn't, necessarily. There are plenty of aces who want to have kids. In fact, it's a pretty common topic over at /r/asexuality. I've seen plenty of people bemoaning how they feel that their sexuality makes it difficult to pursue relationships, marriage, and children.

Being asexual doesn't mean that you don't like sex, never want to have kids, or aren't interested in relationships. It just means that you aren't physically attracted to any sex or gender.

As for me personally, I really don't want to have biological children - not because I'm asexual, but rather because pregnancy is terrifying and I'd just rather not. I might adopt, though. 




 I'm pretty sure that I remember that line from the books. I'd have to read through it again and see the show in context though to give a solid opinion on it.

Edit: I watched it. The scene was pretty great. Can't believe that just happened. 




 Well first off, that guy can go to hell. Fuck him, you're a cop, it's your fucking job, not playtime.

But yeah, I get stuff like this all the time since I'm gender non-conforming and I was a huge tomboy as a kid. 




 Nope, sorry. 




 Hello, redditors!

I'm a college student who is really into video games, comics, anime, sci-fi, fantasy, cosplay, and all sorts of other nerdy goodness, and I'm looking for other people who share my interests. I'd like to have some internet pals that I can occasionally chat with and perhaps play games or roleplay online together.

FYI, I'm queer and don't tolerate nonsense, so if you aren't okay with that we probably won't make good friends.

Edit: I should also add that I really like visual novels. If you're into VNs hit me up! 




 Thanks for the input, I couldn't personally say as I've never been to the Belton location (my local chapter is near Indianapolis). 




 Well if you're looking for larps near you, I figured there would be plenty in San Antonio. /shrug/

Anyway, I'm currently playing Dystopia Rising (a great post-apocalypse larp) and the Texas location is in Belton, which should be a little over two hours away for you. I know the people from there are all pretty awesome, so if it sounds like your sort of thing you should check it out. They meet up one weekend a month. 




 Possibly linked to a UTI. 




 He specifically said "my wife did not poop *on our daughter*," the implication being that she might have pooped, it just didn't get on the baby. 




 I agree with the blogger in the link. While no one should be ashamed of their sexuality, straight people do not need a pride movement. Straight people don't have to deal with the same bullshit. When was the last time a straight person:

* Was told they were going to hell for being straight
* Was told they were an abomination because of their sexuality
* Was told that they were probably abused as a child because of their sexuality
* Was told that they should get their hormones checked after mentioning they're straight
* Was told that being straight is "just a phase"
* Was told by family members that they are no longer welcome in their home/at family functions because they are straight
* Faced harassment by random strangers for being straight
* Was afraid of getting stopped by the cops because of their sexuality
* Was fired from their job because they were straight
* Was evicted from their home for being straight
* Was not allowed to marry their opposite-sex partner simply because they were an opposite-sex couple
* Was told that if they were sexually assaulted they would then have the "correct" sexuality
* Was brutally attacked/killed because someone found out they were straight
* Etc., etc.

I'm not saying that straight people should be ashamed of being straight or cisgender, because they shouldn't. But no one is telling straight, cis people that they shouldn't exist or don't have rights because of their sexuality or gender identity. The whole point of the pride movement is that people who are GRSM are fighting back against the incorrect notions that they are wrong, disgusting, or lesser. We are fighting back against all the people who say we aren't human or don't deserve to live freely as everyone else. Straight, cis people don't need a pride movement because telling you to stop being shitty to gay people is not the same thing as oppression. 




 I started playing Dangan Ronpa a few days ago. Right now I'm in the investigation of chapter 2. So far I like it. 




 When I was born, or maybe for my first birthday or baptism or something (it was really early on okay) one of my relatives bought me The Giving Tree. My mom would read it to me every night. She told me that at one point when I was around two or so, she went in to read me the story before bed like usual, but I stopped her and said "No, mommy, I'm going to read it to you." And then I went through the whole book, page for page, line for line, and "read" her the entire book, which I had completely memorized. I didn't actually know how to read, I just knew where all the words were. Ever since then I've always loved that book, and I also liked Shel Silverstein in general as a child (I got his other poem books later on).

The author I really liked as a kid was Dr. Seuss. After The Giving Tree, the next book I remember having read to me every night was Fox In Sox. My stepdad read that one to me. Every night he would first read through the whole book at a normal pace, and then again really fast - it was a lot of fun because the whole book was full of tongue twisters and he would inevitably mess up the lines, and I would laugh.

I miss those days sometimes ... 




 Welp, that is certainly a pickle. I can certainly understand that you don't want to cause any untoward harm toward either your husband or your new guy, but honestly there is no pretty way out of a situation like this. You can only do the best you can and hope that it all doesn't implode.

First, let's address the husband. It's great that you love him, but honestly it seems to me like you really love him in a more platonic than romantic way. This means your relationship would be inherently imbalanced; you don't have the same feelings for each other. Also, you don't seem to have the same boundaries for what is acceptable in the relationship - since you can see other people you pretty much have an open marriage, but you were in favor of this so that your husband could be happy while he is only allowing to see your beau out of guilt. If he's only letting you see someone else because he's already seen other people and can't reasonably say no without being a total hypocrite, that's an issue.

You feel like you're stuck and that you owe husband something, but honestly you've already put a lot of effort into this relationship. If after five years of marriage (plus however long you were together before then) isn't enough to make you feel like this relationship is worthwhile, I don't think anything will at this point. You really need to sit down and assess your feelings on the matter. If you still love him at all in a romantic way, then it's not unreasonable to want to keep trying. But if you feel like you're only in the relationship because you feel like you owe him, then this is not going to pan out. Staying in a marriage out of pity is unfair to both of you.

Now, on to the beau. It sounds like you've found everything in this guy that you wish you had with your husband. You love him, you're attracted to him, and things are going well. Some of this is probably to do with new relationship buzz, but I wouldn't be so quick to pass this guy up. If you've only been together a short while it would be rather daunting to ask him to wait around while you attempt to patch up your marriage. But if this guy knows you're having problems then maybe you should talk this over with him and see how he feels about it. It seems like you don't want to quit seeing this guy, and I don't blame you. So unless giving up this relationship is the only way you can save your marriage (which I really don't think it is, you have too many other issues) I wouldn't do it.

Long story short, you need to do what's right for you. It's nice that you're thinking about other people in this situation, but trust me, trying to worry about everyone else's feelings to the detriment of your own will get you nowhere. Don't worry about what your husband or your new guy need right now, worry about what you need right now, and decide where to go from there. 




 Yeah, dragons are pretty awesome! :D Thanks. 




 We went to Destination (they're more figurine heavy than comic heavy), and we also went to a newer one in the strip across from the St. Matthew's mall. It only opened a few months back, so if you haven't checked it out yet you should - it's pretty small but they had a decent selection. I think it's called The Zone.

My favorite is still Roll of the Die, though. 




 Derby traffic was interfering with Free Comic Book Day. 'Nuff said. 




 If you're worried about leading her on, you should probably confirm with her at some point that this isn't a date, you just wanted to hang out as friends. Otherwise, if she seems interested later on in dating, just tell her that you had fun but you're not really feeling a connection. You don't have to come out to her to tell her you're not interested. 




  I get really frustrated being the walking encyclopedia

I know that feel. It's definitely frustrating and exhausting being the only out person your friends know and constantly being interrogated about it.

I have no problem with people who are genderfluid, but I can definitely see where you would run into problems. There are tons of people who have no idea what that is or how it works, and it really doesn't help that the same "just pick one already" mentality that bi and ace people get is shoved onto you, too. For some reason people can't comprehend that gender and sexuality don't have to be rigid, sometimes they change, and just because you used to be one thing doesn't mean you're faking it or you went through/are going through a phase. Temporary change doesn't make it any less valid. So I hope you can stick it out, too, and keep being you despite what everyone else thinks.

To be honest, for a while now I've been contemplating my own gender identity. Although I'm female bodied I also usually feel more comfortable with more masculine clothes and whatnot. I don't have body dysphoria, though - the only time I really feel dysphoria is when I have to perform as hyper-feminine, like when I have to dress up for family gatherings (weddings, etc.) where I'm required to wear makeup or dresses. I hate wearing that stuff, because it feels like I'm wearing a costume, putting on a feminine persona, and it's not really me. I don't really care about pronouns or anything, I just usually go by female stuff because I have female parts and that's what's most convenient. So if asked I tell people I'm "gender non-conforming" because nothing else really seems to fit. 




 Thanks for the kind words and support. 




  I wonder if your frustration is amplified because it is juxtaposed against your recent upswing.

I think that it certainly is. Having to deal with ignorance is always frustrating, but it especially sucks whenever I hadn't had to deal with ignorant comments from people I know in a while. There have always been ignorant people on the internet, but at least I could say "well that's the internet, my IRL friends are all cool so it's good."

I still feel kind of crummy, but I'll be hanging out with friends this weekend and that usually makes me feel better since I can complain to them and they'll understand and back me up. Plus hanging out with them is fun, and I could use some fun.

The upside of all this is that despite how exhausting it can be to constantly have to educate people about my identity, it's times like this when I realize that asexual advocacy is certainly a place where I am needed and can make some real, positive change. Dealing with ignorance sucks, but every time I take the time to call someone out or answer their questions (which I've been doing a lot of lately), I'm also investing in the future. Because the more I work to amend ignorance now, the less me or others like me will have to deal with it later on down the road. 




 Can't say that I have, although I know what I'll do the next time I'm sleeping over at a friend's house and we're really fucking bored at stupid o' clock. 




 Once I made a post asking for some relationship advice on how to make my SO feel better about being shot down when asking other people out (we're poly). Some random dude then proceeded to tell me that because I'm asexual it's probably causing unnecessary strain on the relationship (despite the problem having nothing to do with my orientation) and I should either leave the man I've been with for five and a half years or let him rape me because MEN NEED SEX. 




 The worst kind of prudes - sex-obsessed prudes. Literally our country's conceptualization of sex is so fucked up and contradictory, it's amazing that we haven't created some sort of black hole of un-logic. 




 Hello, lovely people. I hope you all have been doing well. I haven't been doing so well lately for many reasons, and I just need to share and hopefully get some understanding, I hope you all won't mind.

After many many years of not saying much about my sexuality, I have recently been coming out to more and more people about the fact that I'm asexual. It came up in conversation with my mother after she sort of cornered me about it in the car, and that went well(?) for the most part. Also, I was at a large family gathering recently for my grandfather's (mom's dad) funeral, at which some of my relatives brought up a facebook post I made discussing my identity. They wanted to know more, but didn't have time to talk because funeral. But I think I'm okay on that front as well.

In addition to telling more of my family I also decided to do my final presentation in my communications class about asexuality; it was well received by my professors and classmates. Now if only I could work up the courage to actually post the talk online ...

So anyway, things were starting to look up for me as far as coming out goes. I have plenty of great friends who accept me and even some fellow ace buddies. And family seems confused but mostly alright with it. After so many positives, I thought I'd be able to handle coming out to people who are relative strangers.

I started going to my very first LARP (live action role play) event a while back, and joined the newly-formed facebook pride group made up of various LARP members from across the country. And things went downhill quickly. I have realized after several conversations on various posts that I don't quite fit in with these people. At first I thought it was great that I was meeting so many new queer and nerdy friends, but then people starting making posts talking about how labels don't matter (which, for most asexual people, they do - a lot). Or about how the A stands for Ally - or was it amoeba? Because humans can't be asexual.

Ugh.

I know there were at least two or three other asexual people who were a part of that group, but it honestly felt like I was the only one in those conversations who was well educated on asexual issues because the rest of them barely talked at all about it. Basically I had to single-handedly explain to some very ignorant people what my identity is and why it's not okay to call me a bacterium etc.

I hate that "safe" spaces for queer folks often end up being places where I am yet again dehumanized and erased and talked over, just like everywhere else. It's shit like this that makes me wish I never came out in the first place, because it is so fucking exhausting to have to explain to people over and over and over that I EXIST AND I HAVE FEELINGS. Is it really so much to ask that I be treated with the same human dignity as everyone else??

So yeah, after dealing with a lot of other stuff - funeral, family drama, university finals, no money - this last bit of awful just really tanked my mood and even several days later it's still bothering me. Thanks to anyone who's read so far, I hope you all are having a better time lately that I have. 




 As someone who is both queer and suffers from mental illness (including depression), I really don't like the comparison they're making. Activists have been fighting for decades to make sure that being gay, trans, ace, etc. is not seen as a pathological illness, and then this person comes along and says "saying you have depression is just like coming out as gay." No, no it is not. Those are two fundamentally different things. Yes, mental illness is stigmatized. However, the parallels here are tenuous at best. GSRM people are discriminated against because of an innate part of who they are that they cannot willfully change, but nor should they have to, because there's nothing wrong with being queer. There is, however, a real need to treat mental illness.

The stigma is unfortunate, but we have diagnoses for a reason - if you are mentally ill, you can find treatment which will hopefully help you achieve a better quality of life. That has a lot to do with what's going on with a person internally, though - in contrast to the issues that the LGBTQ community faces which are due to external pressures. 




 Because historically, this is where some of the most outspoken shitlords have always lived. That's the best explanation I can come up with, anyway. Don't worry, though - there's little pockets of sanity here and there. 




 Agreed, if they pick one it will probably be Koujaku. As long as it's not the "true" route I'll be fine with it. 




 Cool, I'm not the only one who took issue with it then.

Also I mostly played it for the feels, and the stellar art. Because everything else besides the plot was actually really well made. Honestly, I don't normally go for the super-slick guys but Koujaku was super adorable, and he ended up being my second-favorite even though I never thought it would end up like that.

Also, have you seen that they're releasing an anime for DMMd this summer? I wonder if it will be any good, and also how they'll address the multiple routes. 




 Yes, because Batman's never dealt with super strength opponents before ...

 Welp, I can no longer go to bed now because all I can think about is cockroaches crawling all over my face the moment I fall asleep.

 Presumably the Starks would know what he looks like, since they have his image carved in stone somewhere in the catacombs. Of course, they also mentioned at some point in the books that most of them don't wander into the older levels often. But Bran has if I recall correctly, so maybe he would recognize him. 




 I'd be inclined to believe they can turn anything, considering they also have undead mounts and whatnot, plus if you recall not all of the Night's Watch men are from the North, and it's reasonable to assume some of those who turned where from other areas. 




 But Batman fights best at a mid-distance. Spiderman would have a higher advantage closer up, where he could put his super-strength into play (although it would diminish the impact of his precognition). 




 There's a difference, though, between sensing danger coming and being able to appropriately respond to that danger. There were plenty of times when Spidey's senses were tingling, but he didn't have time to appropriately react to it. It's not like he's a freaking oracle, he just gets a vague sense of "Oh shit!" right before it hits the fan. 




 Yeah, I'd say that a Spidey vs. Bats fight would probably go the same way a lot of Batman fights go - he loses initially, then goes off to the cave to regroup. There, he makes a new gadget and/or comes up with a new strategy, and in the next fight he creams them.

This is why Batman is ultimately better, at least imo. What makes him a fearsome opponent isn't that he wins all his fights all or even most of the time. What's terrifying about him is that he has such dogged tenacity. In fact, I'd argue that obsessive determination is Bruce Wayne's superpower. 




 Don't get me wrong, I love me some Spiderman - in fact, he was probably my favorite superhero for a significant portion of my childhood.

But nobody is better than Bats. 




 Also, people who were made tranquil because they were afraid of their own magic powers suddenly getting their magic back might result in a lot of spontaneous abomination type scenarios. 




 I dunno, it's hard to read this as satire of gender assumptions since the usual point of satire is to exaggerate or mock something in order to point out how ridiculous it is, and therefore cause people to rethink their assumptions. This doesn't seem to aim to get people to rethink the assumptions that men are horndogs who only want to get in your pants or that women are emotionally needy and will use sex to manipulate people into getting what they want. It seemed like it was very pointedly saying "this is what happens and I'm above all that," like you were saying about the "asexuals are better" trope (which I agree is super gross). 




 I don't particularly like the gender-based assumptions in this pic. 




 I think this largely depends on what kind of larp you're doing and the particular community you're with. Right now I'm larping at the Dystopia Rising location near Indianapolis, there's actually a lot of women in that group (which I didn't expect but I'm pretty happy about since I'm not in a tiny minority for once), and a good mix of POC as well. Not many black people specifically, but quite a few people of all sorts. Out of about 100 people, maybe 15-20% or so. There have been a few issues with casual racism that I've witnessed but not anything really horrible and not very frequently.

Can't say much about Maryland, I haven't spent a lot of time down that way but you'll never know until you try I suppose. 




 Sounds good to me! 




 You look fantastic! Also your makeup is way better than anything I could do lol 









 That's awesome! Black Panther does not get enough love. 




 I think the most important thing to keep in mind is that asexual/aromantic people are often totally fulfilled and happy having close platonic relationships. Often times people will assume that asexuals are unhappy because they can't have relationships (which isn't true - we can). That, or we're described as robotic or somehow less than human because sexuality is a "natural" part of the human experience (which of course implies that asexuality is somehow "unnatural").

As long as you can show your character being happy with herself and her friendships, you're well on your way to writing a good asexual character. Really, just write a good character first and foremost, and think about asexuality as a secondary concern. Because ultimately we're all people.

However, if you wanted to have some sort of plotline about experiences that are specific to asexual people, you should read through some posts here and asexual blogs talking about microagressions and oppression and whatnot, it will give you a good idea of what we sometimes have to deal with.

Edit: Oh, by the way, I'd also like to read your story when you're done! And if you need anyone to proofread for you I'd be happy to help - I have a lot of experience with that sort of thing.
