 Another interesting part: Some scientists are upset that the risky expedition caused important resources (supply ships, crew, equipment) to be diverted from other research sites in Antarctica. http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/31/rescue-effort-for-trapped-antarctic-voyage-disrupts-serious-science/?_r=0 
























 Renewables now make up 15.9% of U.S. generation capacity, more than oil and nukes combined. 
































































































































































































































 Seems unbelievable, but the key is the size of the wind farms they modeled. The number of turbines ranged from 78,000 to 540,000. An array that large could slow the winds enough that they wouldn't immediately destroy the turbines themselves. 









































































































































































 Yes -- here's what a 2011 Nature study (linked in article) says: "Contrail cirrus are composed of ice crystals thatsimilarly to natural cirrusreflect solar short-wave radiation and trap outgoing long-wave radiation." Because they're so long-lived, the trapping effect outweighs the reflection effect. 









 NBC poll shows that most Americans--67%--support new EPA carbon emissions standards--will policymakers listen to their constituents as we head into the fall election? 




 Portland sets a great example of how to be a bike-friendly city! 




 The West's wildfires are increasing in size and the fire season is expanding along with the costs of fighting them. The most proactive way to fight fires is to fight climate change. 




 Not good news, especially for Pacific Northwest shellfish aquaculture, and a call for increased proactive coastal management that includes acidification. 




 Unlikely place to test agricultural pesticides, especially when so many of Kauai's species are listed as under the Endangered Species Act.  




 Hopeful news for a binding agreement in Paris. 




 The benefits of walkable cities extends beyond energy efficiency and economics to include community development, which contributes to higher GDP per capita in these cities.  




 Obama's proposal to protect 782,000 square miles not only helps Pacific bluefin tuna, but also becomes a sanctuary for marine species long into the future.

 The media's job is not ostensibly to present both sides of an issue. Doing so leads to "false balance," which has been especially apparent in scientifically settled issues such as anthropogenic climate change. See http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/sciencetoolkit_04 and http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/may/23/john-oliver-best-climate-debate-ever 





























 Agreed -- very cool phenomenon. Here's a link to the video: http://e360.yale.edu/slideshow/blizzard_helps_scientists_visualize_airflow_around_wind_turbines/328/1/
