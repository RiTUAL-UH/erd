 If we are really rational, I cannot imagine why someone would dare to bear this kind of responsibility because any real default will have a huge impact not only on the U.S. and China, but on the global economy, said Professor Zhao Longkai, a dean at the Guanghua School of Management at Beijing University. Its hard for us to imagine anyone can be that crazy to push the limit to that level.
