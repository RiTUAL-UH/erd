 Agreed. 




 Drapes would be too interesting. 




 Yes. 









 It's've* 




 Oh, you're too kind, dear.  




 I know someone like this. He's a dear.

 Examples? 




 My manager who used to work at a casino in Louisiana said that he would see the Duck Dynasty guys all the time and they would lose ridiculous amounts of money on a regular basis. 









 Whoa 




 Studying for math. 




 I remember the first time I played Oblivion. After leaving the sewers, I didn't turn around, so I had no idea the imperial city was right behind me. Just spent two hours walking around looking for one of those damn cities. 




 I think the most interesting thing about a WWI game would be the fact that they combined (at the time) futuristic weaponry with very obsolete strategies. That's one of the things that made the war so devastating. It wasn't only trench warfare, a lot of interesting things could be done with it.

 They've announced Lobo as the first DLC character. 




 What did your grandmother ever do to you?

Edit: and now my joke makes no sense... 




 It actually works on low and high attacks. I'm not very good at hitting it at the right time, though. 




 I think I'd enjoy MK style mechanics over SF style. Street Fighter has just never really appealed to me that much. Just my two cents. 




 You, sir, are a poo. 




 Actually, a project called "Version Two" was supposed to be made into Battlefront 3. First Assault was gonna be a marketplace game to help fund the soon-to-be Battlefront II sequel. 




 Wait, people don't do that? What do they say now? 




 Yeah, I think it's RMCF, I remember the one in Winter Park, CO had one outside. 




 Man, this is totally shopped. Get out of this subreddit, poseur. 




 Feminists are so conceited sometimes. I swear to god, they think anything to do just with men is an insult to them, somehow. I once held a door open for a woman and she started screaming at me about how I'm doing it because I think she's "weak" and because she's a woman. Bitch, I don't care what gender you are, I was just being polite. 




 Russia isn't, sir. 




 If you want a Star Wars shooter, there's a pretty cool mod for CoD 4.  




 Since I work for mainly tips, fuck you, you can't have my services.

 To put it simply, Tolkien really didn't like technology.

 "Ahh.. Pop that pussy for a real nigga
Pull out my black card, that's my lil nigga
Make a movie with your bitch, Steven Spiel nigga"

Oh, Lil Wayne... What would we do without you and Steven Spielnigga? 




 I can't blow my goddamn nose. 




 That's an awfully curvy L, don't you think?

Edit: in all seriousness, though, that's pretty cool. 




 My parents and I all thought I was just high energy, then I was diagnosed with ADHD. Aren't logical fallacies awkward? 




 Relevant username. 




 Totally just read that in Nigel Thornberry's voice. 




 Dude, me too. Fuck rainbows. 




 You smiled at your sex as the door shut? 




 As someone who works at a car wash/detailing place, I can relate. I can relate so gooooood. 




 A friend of mine was at the Olympic training center for archery and met Michael Phelps. When he tried to say hi, Phelps just said, "Fuck off," and walked away. 




 Hit the nail right on the head. Exactly how I feel, man.

 This is essentially Japan's wet willy. 




 Nice pin stripe! 




 I've been fairly lucky with my first gen PS3 still kickin'. Though the fan sounds like a Boeing. 




 Would a "put.... Put your dick in it" be relevant here?  




 Totally thought a car was gonna hit him at the end. 




 Am I a bad person if I saw black face immediately? 




 I stopped going to the fridge at night because I'd accidently leave the milk in the glass cabinet.... 




 If you aren't making eye contact you aren't doing it right. 




 It literally took me 2 minutes to see the damn goat. Ashamed. 




 The fact that that happened to her is kinda morbid, but the general post is kind of uplifting.  




 Well, from the video he could've easily been white, so you did make assumptions.  




 Put... Put your dick in it... 




 She's cuuuuute. Kinda. Like in a baby kitten road kill kinda way. If it were covered in more dead kittens. And then had that volcano on her face added on for good measure. 




 A Russian exchange student at my school told me it's just highly recommended.  




 "Ur" repetitive. 




 She should go pro! 




 He died instantly.... The next day. 




 I've heard they also have villages where they send people with HIV and AIDS to die.

 Half-Life. I want them to just say that 3 won't be made so I can be done with it forever. The fandom is annoying, Gordon Freeman isn't really a character, so why should he be revered the way he is, and I'm tired of hearing about it literally everywhere. 




 That band, man... 




 MOTHERFUCKIN' SHIBE 




 So worth it. 




 I Hate Hartley 




 Saw these guys on their first American tour. They were amazing then and have only gotten better!

 I never got to see it, what was so bad about it? 




 Shaking hands....

 We've known Teppei personally for a few years, now. He's a really cool and layer back guy!

Edit: We took him to dinner before the shows every time he came to CO since we met him. 









 I still do. It's the handle, man. The handle makes drinking anything better. 




 Most probable worst case scenario, you YLOD and need new thermal paste. You'll probably be ok! 




 My school had an assembly about it. I had no choice. 




 Wait... Then what the fuck is a berry? 




 It's a collection of all the TF2 comics, L4D comics, and the like for other games. 




 That sounds fucking awesome. Literal all-star cast. 




 Ah, I see you've unlocked the [Butthurt] trait. New player? 




 Thanks for making me realize I don't know how borrowing works... Asshole. 




 Aaaaaaaaand you're a bad person. 




 One of my favorite bands! 









 FUCK YOU, FERD, YOU UNFABULOUS SHIT

Edit: Why the *fuck* do I keep seeing you?! 




 You two will always be at odds.  




 Well, realistically, Tolkien never would've been able to finish it because it's just so extensive. 




 Dammit, I can't handle unfinished Middle-Earth, if GoT is never finished I'll go insane. 




 Yeah, I pretty much said "fuck that" after seeing words like vivacious, bemused, and haughtiness. I learned two of those words last year. 




 Everything on NoSleep is true even if it isn't. 




 Dude... Fuck you. 




 I'm afraid of the beach, oceans, and lakes for this very reason. 




 Tricycles. I am terrified of riding tricycles.

Edit: also, laying on my stomach with my legs hanging over an edge. I'm terrified someone is just going to walk up and break my knees by hitting/pushing my lower legs really hard.

Edit 2: OH! And moths flying into my ears.  




 It's gonna be Cooking Mama X Mass Effect! 




 I thought that was a subreddit and tried exceptionally hard to figure out how it would be relevant before clicking on it. Needless to say, I was disappointed. 




 /r/DIY ? It sounds like it belongs there... But I've never seen a casket on it, so I don't know. 




 Well there's different words for different age groups. I can't remember off the type of my head, but pedophile really only applies to a range of like 7-9 year olds or something like that. 




 What's one of the most fun things you've ever done and why? 




 I agree. Not to mention, I feel like exclamation points make me seem excited, so caps convey anger better. 




 I'd like some recommendations, any genre at all.  If you like it, I'll check it out.

Edit: Thanks a bunch! I'll do my best to check all of them out! 




 I'd like something new to read and I'm not going to say what I've already read in order to get a little more variety. So, bring it on!

Edit: Why the down votes? I'd just like a few new comics to read....

Edit 2: Thanks a lot, guys! I'll try and check all of them out!

 I saw a Prius that said "smuggg" on the plates in reference to the Southpark episode. I thought it was pretty funny. 




 There's nothing fabulous about you, Ferd.... 




 THANK YOU O_O 




 That's my phone's shadow. 









 Ooh! ME! 




 Over yonder! 




 I'm a T Swift fan, myself. 




 With Taylor Swift? She won an award and he jumped up on stage and took the mic from her and started screaming about how Beyonce should've won. It's where the "I'mma let you finish, but..." Joke came from. 




 There was a duffel bag left in the school parking lot and the police were called. All this bomb threat jazz and it was later found out to be a Kermit the Frog doll that was stolen from one of the teachers earlier that year. It is now a school "holiday" where everybody wears green.

 No one beats Liam fucking Neeson in FO3! 




 Well, since I'm all the way down here.... 




 I know a lot of military and they're good people that are going through exactly what we're going through. Don't blame them. 




 It was the same with me. A game with no dialogue or really in depth backstory made me tear up at the end. Only game that ever made me do that. 




 I'd recommend you get Journey and the Unfinished Swan. They're both PS Store purchases and they're amazing. 




 Oh, yeah. My bad. 




 There's an arcade game called T.E.C. 3001. It's awesome.

Edit: Indie* 




 Because it's a heavily anticipated game from a prestigious studio. 




 Well, by your logic, you got your ignorance from your father and you're completely ignorant of the fact. 




 YOU'RE AN AWFUL THREAD 




 As much as I dislike GameStop's way of business, I'd hate to see them go. They have some good stuff and the employees their are some of the best conversations I've had about the video game industry and really nice guys. 




 Completely absurd, my good man. 




 May I partake?


YOU SHIT-EATING, CRUSTY, JAGGED PIECE OF WALRUS ANUS 




 Not exactly what I was looking for, but I still like it! Thanks! 




 Like one that shows off really cool or creative cars, motorcycles, ect. 




 I also think the PS3's Netflix layout is a lot better. The Xbox' is just annoying to use. 




 I saw the thumbnail and didn't read the title... I thought it was an Anchorman 2 picture. I'll just say I was disappointed. 




 In quite a butthurt fashion, might I say. 




 The butthurt is strong in this one. 




 Ah, I believe you meant to say empanada, my good man. 




 I keep getting Serious Sam and Duke Nukem 3D coupons. 




 What's with Guy Fawkes masks and these pictures? 




 I... I take 45 minute bathroom breaks. No one believes that I just don't care enough to get up sometimes.

 We also like to verb nouns. 




 I just cannot do the Misfits. I can't explain why. 




 They were just touring with a bunch of heavier bands. If you're into metal/metalcore, that is. 




 My name is Mac. It's not so much annoying as much as I've just heard it all by now.

 Nope. 




 I've heard a lot of good things about it. I'll check it out! 














 So, "wore in my underwear while I made your order?" 




 Just your monthly reminder to go get a dog! 




 I feel like I've seen this video here multiple times in the past few weeks. I may be wrong, though. 




 Well, I can't explain them to you! I don't know what they are, either! 




 If you go to /r/bitcoin, there's lots of info there. 




 Don't need none'a that here! 




 I may have gone a little overboard... 









 I was seriously thinking it was the one I usually go to.... But your comment has made me second guess myself. 




 Every now and then I find myself wondering what it would be like if we just ejaculated one big sperm. It keeps me up some nights. 




 My neighbor's sister rear-ended somebody.... On her way out of the dealership. 




 When she was really young, my sister cut her hair on only one side of her head and then tried to walk past my mom and go to a friends house. She tried to play it off as her "falling" when my mom stopped her. 




 Yeah, but, ya know.... Fuck that. 




 KoTOR has to be one of my favorite games of all time! I've had it for years and only just finished it for the first time a few months ago. 




 Thank you! 









 Sex. I really don't care. 




 You realize how dark those movies really were, later on... And it's so fucked up. 




 Which Flashpoint is it, exactly? 




 I almost never use the Masterball out of fear that I'll need it some other time... 




 Why does religion always have to be cited as an enemy of science? The group that doesn't believe in these things is in the minority. You're being just as closed-minded as they are. 




 I don't know about trading, but you can sell at the LS Customs. 




 Swamps of Dagoba is a fucking masterpiece. 




 Well, there's all this philosophy about whether people are inherently good or evil. It's all perception and not really an answerable question. 




 I fucking loved this video in drivers ed and can't forget it. 




 That game has been and will remain in my top 5 forever! 




 *Karmanaut* 




 You are Karmanaut 




 I've been using an old piece of paper as a mouse pad for around a year, now. It's worked surprisingly well, so far. 




 This is seriously one of the most difficult questions, ever, for me. 




 It's especially sad because none of them recognized him. 




 All I hear is CITROEEEENN! 




 I'm having great fun with it. I just haven't been able to join any sessions the past 5 days.... 




 Nah, just as fun, though. 




 Because he's fucking good at it! 




 Whoa, there. 




 The seller has been killing everyone that they have sent the camera to and taken a picture. 




 I realize that it's not common at all, but I am currently learning about the stock market in American high school. 




 Oh, I didn't know that. Thanks! 




 I'm a pretty big fan of the Prius plugs on Bones. 




 The closest one is probably the Ruiner and that's pretty loose. 




 Do you have to keep putting cars back into the garage (mainly the 4 car ones)? I've noticed that if I took one out and didn't put it back in or it got destroyed, it would no longer be saved in the garage. This happened 3 times (once in franklin's/aunt's house garage, once in Trevor's 4-car garage, and once in michael's 4-car garage) and I'm wondering if it's a glitch or the game is supposed to be like that. 




 You *know* Rockstar would put that in, too. 




 It is a country, isn't it? 




 As someone who isn't even halfway through, yet.... Oh, my fucking god.  




 I'm pretty sure that's what happens when they grow up in too small a space.

 I don't own a WiiU, but I have a PS3, so prepare for bias. PS3 is awesome. Get one. 




 I consistently fall behind technology-wise and end up moving to new eras a lot slower than all the other civs. I don't really know what to do about it... 




 Because they're actually a communist propaganda manufacturer.

Edit: as well as the letter Z and the number 20. Those are tools of communism. 




 CoD4 has a HUGE PC player base. It is a little more popular if you look for ProMod servers though, which makes the game a little more difficult. 




 Hey! I have one of those, but it's shaped like a deer! 




 Well, he *is* really good at dying. 




 It looks like whoever took this screen cap is missing some models and textures. 




 I think what you're talking about is the guy that kept a journal of everything he did in Skyrim. It actually really helps with immersion if you like writing, at all. 




 You should check it out. It's really good! It's called the Titan EP. 




 Have you heard their new EP? 




 Somebody make a subreddit just for these videos. Now. 




 I thought people liked that movie, am I wrong? I haven't seen it yet, so I don't know any of this. 




 Still haven't seen a show better than these guys. 









 The Unfinished Swan is a really cool indie game. 




 As a teenager, fuck them. 




 I finished that game for the first time since buying it years ago.... And it felt great. 




 Simultaneous isn't bad.  




 I definitely didn't play the third one to see the ending. I really wanted to see how my decisions in the second game affected the third game. 




 Oh, my god. Fuck those guys. 




 I got to have the rare experience that is a wall of death in a 150-200 person venue. It was... Odd, to say the least. 
























 CO is best state!

 It's working. I've fired a gun once in my life and after spending time on reddit, every picture with a gun makes me look if their finger's on the trigger. 




 I don't think I'm responsible enough. :P 




 Someone should make this. 




 I think that's just because Killswitch is a lot more radio friendly than the average metalcore band. Which could be a way that they're the Nickleback of the genre, I guess. 




 Good God, man! Restrain yourself! 




 A longer part would have been hilarious. 




 Oh, my god. I forgot he was in that movie! You're absolutely right! 




 Like the big climbing puzzles to get Altair's armor. Those were badass! 




 Was it really only 60? It felt like it went on for so long! 




 I think he's always been a Christian. He's just being a lot more open about it now. 




 I think it's amazing. You should at least give it a try. 




 I'd think it would be a much more mature Invader Zim, considering that guy wrote IZ. 




 I know it's not a real accent, but that weird shit from After Earth. Like... It's just bad. 




 /r/punk can help you out. They have regular posts about bands from certain countries, genres, etc. 




 It's always been his character. Easy to recognize. 




 It's true, though. Miatas are good cars, but people won't shut up about them. 




 I'm learning about it in school right now. Albeit in an optional class...

 The AmA in question:

 A free doughnut? 




 That's not true. It went April, June, August, October, November. Only that last one actually came in about a month. 




 Isn't that like a tie-in with Flags of Our Fathers? 




 The graphics are actually still fairly good looking.  The game's aged really well.  I feel like, with that in mind, and HD remake would look pretty amazing. 




 Wow, thanks for explaining that. I hope everything gets better, soon. 




 Thanks for answering. That lighting actually sounds really cool! 




 I finally get to one of these early enough and I can't think of a question! I'll just settle with saying that the game looks amazing and I'm excited to see where else it goes! Big fan of Obsidion. Good luck!

Edit: OOH! I thought of some.
What thing about PoE has you most excited?
Also, what would you say is the most unique thing about the game? 




 Yeah... I'm usually not phased by gore, but... I think I'll just leave this one alone. 




 I usually do fine with gore, but I'm afraid to click literally every link in this thread. 




 I'm honestly curious if *this* would make someone cut again or want to stop right then. 




 Tellmewhatstherebecauseimscared 




 Post it. Now. 




 I understand you not liking Thrice's change in style, but personally, I thought they were just as good in the end. Obviously for different reasons, though. 




 Yeah, I liked then until Johnny left. Then it just wasn't the same. 




 I would've told my friend to go fuck himself. That's really shitty that he made you leave because he didnt want to be there.

 Nope 




 It's a famous scream that's heard in a LOT of movies.

 I believe AC4 had an in-game answer about a modern AC. Something along the lines of vehicles not fitting the kind of game they want AC to be. 




 I think he always has the ring, he just doesn't wear it in the real world, where Mal is dead. In the dream world it's back on his finger because Mal is "alive" there. I could be completely wrong, though. 




 Written by the guy that writes the Walking Dead comics, too. 




 Those new-ish automatic shifters (like on the Prius) are the fucking devil at my wash. I've worked there over a year and still can't figure out accessory mode. 




 Only slightly related, but those stupid alarm systems that make the car *HONKHONKHONK* whenever you open or close the doors are ridiculous. 




 "Bless your heart" is the rudest way of saying that they pity you. And it hurts. 




 DAMMIT! DOLLARS, MAN, *DOLLARS!* 




 That whole trilogy is awesome! 




 Fuck, barely anyone remembers it now! 100 years just sounds silly. 




 What the fuck? Why? Those are fucking weird. 




 I was thinking the same about the second. I mean, Jesus... 














 Oh, I see. Thanks! 




 Does anyone know what the difference between part 1 and 2 is going to be? I just want to know so I don't end up buying 2 games when it wouldn't be necessary. Sorry if this is a stupid question.

Edit: words 




 You could always just grab Deadpool Classic. Or I started with Merc With a Mouth, which is an amazing collection. 




 It *was* short, but I had fun and that's all that matters. 




 Jack. 




 Despite them obviously going against the canon, I think this game still looks pretty good. As a fan of both the books and the movies, I'm kind of excited for this. 




 I always just assumed they were really sturdy clothes lines in AC. 




 It is. If people don't specify, I just assume its american unless I see a flag or something. 




 I'm not really sure if I'm using the right words, but I meant like of they're doing it to make fun of themselves or something else. 




 Not if it's self aware. 




 It felt like a bag of sand. 




 FO3 and NV as well. 




 I've had the memorized for all Bethesda games since Oblivion. 




 Well, to have a subreddit about the lack of belief in something makes no sense. It's the same as having a subreddit for people who don't like the color blue or don't use Netflix. An anti circle jerk is pretty likely for such a pointless idea. I don't feel superior, I just think that the idea is ridiculous. 




 I think the worst ones are fucking seasonal achievements that you can only get at one point of the year it was put on and then never again. 




 Mine, too. It took forever to delete so I went to turn the TV off and let it do its thing, but turned the Playstation off without thinking. The file got corrupted and promptly took 2.5 hours to delete. 




 *That's* it! You're right. I guess, now, the question is, what does it do to you? 




 Why does that name sound so nasty? 




 Uhhhh, Suzuki X-90, brah! 




 I mean for more games. There just aren't enough on it, at the moment. 




 Dominic Robilliard, previous experience: creative director of an unreleased game with excessive amounts of hype. 




 I agree. I wish I'd waited a little for more games to come out. All I've used my PS4 for lately is Bluray, Netflix, and ACIV. Other than that, it's all PS3 and PC. 




 I organize them by genre (not very well, either), but I like the idea of "not completed," "completed," etc. I might switch to that. 




 I see a dog. 




 That's my favorite model of the STI. I think I just like cars that are a bit more square, I don't know. 




 The SX4 automatic has AWD as well. 




 I think you're replying to the wrong guy. I was just pointing out that 300 was based on a comic book. Looking back on it, I'm not sure if it really added to the argument or anything because the comic book is based on history, but is extremely fictitious. 




 The photo description says that it was also simultaneously stinging him. 




 I just saw you guys with ABR. I'm totally going again. 




 Yeah. Not everybody has the same taste. 




 My two favorite indie games, by far. 




 Yes, but 300 was based on a graphic novel that doesn't claim to be accurate in any way. 




 I agree. I just can't get into it. 




 Jesus, deep water terrifies me. 
























 At the end of last year in place of the ever popular Hchste Kaiser's Word, there was a live showing of the execution of the show's news team. Before the execution, Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 explained to the people that the news team was being punished after the discovery that they were stealing classified information and supplying it to the terrorist group currently at large and killing Liechtenstein's citizens. The execution was done by pistol and carried out personally by the nation's leader. After the execution he stated that betrayal to the country in any form will not be tolerated. 




 At this point just asking would be more unique than anything else. 




 Jesus, for a second I thought he was. 




 Well I feel silly. I meant to add something to the post before submitting it. 




 Liechtenstein is doing nothing. We had no property in space. 

In other news, the terrorist cell currently attacking unarmed civilians and government buildings has begun spreading its demands across the Internet. They are calling for a stop to the construction of the Wall and reopening of the nation's borders. The group claims to be making these demands in order to stop what they foresee to be a rapid downfall in the country's economy that they fear will have a large and irreparable effect on Liechtenstein's people. The still nameless group had threatened to continue the attacks until their demands are met. Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 has yet to make a public acknowledgement to the terrorists' demands.

Edit: forgot stuff 




 Liechtenstein welcomes you. We have sent a fruit bouquet in hopes of peaceful relations from now on. 




 Yeah, the Ajax near my house is selling a couple really cheap. 




 "Stay out."

~Hchste Kaiser, /u/test_subject7429 




 Liechtenstein wishes for a public execution competition. 




 Fucking do it 




 Our ancestors were right. We'll protect this secret with our lives. 




 Aw man. Well, thanks for letting me know. 




 Hchste Kaiser will attend your silly convention. 




 If you could please clear the confusion on the shape of the Earth, Liechtenstein would be most appreciative.

 When I last saw them Caleb had disappeared into the crowd and someone from the crowd got on stage and finished I Have A Problem. It was pretty great. 




 I've seen them twice now and let me just say that they are the only opening band I've ever seen with so much enthusiasm. They got the entire room moshing. It was fantastic. 




 No problem. I'll wait. My bad. 




 We'd love to continue the service. 




 Liechtenstein might be willing to pay for Sealand's mail service to continue of it's in Great Britain's best interests. 




 Thanks for looking out for me ;) 




 [Meta] Thanks! [Meta] 




 [Meta] Yeah, I'm just having fun with this. And of course, if it ever becomes a nuisance, I'll set her free. 




 Liechtenstein would like to send diplomats to the micro nation of Sealand to discuss annexation as a strategic base. Since its leadership has gone quiet for over a year since claiming the territory, Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 assumes that it is now open to new leadership and, because of it's size, wouldn't count as a full country in regards to annexation. 

Liechtenstein withdraws its attempted negotiations with Austria for annexation of one of its territories. 




 Liechtenstein is willing to send SHIT squads to help with the relief efforts. They're trained for all manner of emergency situations beyond just combat. 




 In the last couple of months there have been three more terrorist explosive attacks. One on a military training facility and two in busy public areas. Liechtenstein's original ideas on the size of this group are either too small or the group is in much deeper than the government originally anticipated. Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 has dispatched multiple SHIT squads and even sent some private agents to various areas to investigate these attacks. 

The entire country's militarization has had little affect on the terrorist attacks as they have all been carried out by lone men and been swift and without warning. 

Hchste Kaiser has voiced his outrage at the terrorists' willingness to harm unarmed civilians and directly disrespect his own rule over the country. He has stated that he will not stop until the group's leader and all of its members are killed or captured and that he is willing to take drastic measures to do so.  




 I was on a tricycle and a friend and I were rolling down a neighbor's driveway into another neighbor's lawn to slow down. Long story short, my shitty trike was nothing on her Big Wheel and I had no helmet. The grass didn't slow me down enough and the front wheel hit a rock. I flipped over the handle bars and hit my head on the rock and blacked out. Then I saw one of my neighbors running toward me yelling my name. Blacked out. Blood on the sidewalk. Blacked out. My front door. Blacked out. Then it was the next day. Tricycles make me nervous now. 




 Beautiful 




 Our eternal leader, Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 has named the bass guitar the national animal of Liechtenstein. They are now government protected creatures under the guidelines set by the newly passed Godly Rythm Act of 2020. All citizens will treat bass guitars from here on out with reverence, love, and the utmost respect or risk public execution. That is all. 




 Liechtenstein has sent a fruit bouquet as a welcome back gift. Just know that they aren't  actual flowers, but fruit under the guise if flowers. We hope you enjoy the fruit man's ruse. 




 I live here and didn't know that! 




 (I was busy yesterday)

Hchste Kaiser's third year as the supreme general of our great nation has been quite eventful. An attempted terrorist attack took place at the capital building while Hchste Kaiser was meeting with all of his officials. Luckily, the explosive malfunctioned and wasn't able to detonate. Turkey was able to supply intelligence that told us that this isn't a single man's idea, but a group effort. The terrorist is still being interrogated for information.

On a brighter side, our great leader recently started a new program for the military elite. The SHIT program will include the best if the best soldiers from both Liechtenstein and France. These SHIT Squads will be used as Hchste Kaiser's personal guard and in missions considered to dangerous for the average soldier or police officer. Hopefully, once the program releases the first groups from training, a terrorist attack like the one mentioned will become much more difficult to execute.

In more recent news, our wonderful leader sent delegates to the Vorarlberg region of Austria to negotiate an annexation. If Austria's own annexation of another area comes to fruition, then Vorarlberg may well become the newest addition to our great nation. These negotiations also led to an alliance between the two countries.

In other news, the construction of the Wall is going as planned, but, sadly, the **subway station's** construction has been haulted until further notice. And finally, Texas finally gave Hchste Kaiser his money back. When asked about the country's new leader, /u/test_subject7429's only response was, "Who? Oh, s***! I'm late for my banjo lessons. Get out!"

This concludes your only choice in yearly news. We thank you for choosing Hchste Kaiser's Word, even though you have no other option.

 Batman   Robin isn't the worst movie. It's just really, really bad. 




 Excellent! Good luck, for both of our sake! 




 We think that would be a great idea. 




 Whatever you choose, Liechtenstein respects the decision. 




 Thanks for considering. We understand if you'd like to keep the land. 




 Liechtenstein would be willing to donate $10B to help with the project. We are also willing to help train pilots and design weapons systems for the ships if needed. 




 Hchste Kaiser wishes to expand, fearing that the small size if our already great nation is a weakness. If Vorarlberg will allow it, we will welcome them into our arms as a new addition to our country. 




 This information is concerning. Thank you for sharing this. 




 Liechtenstein is interested in helping with this project, if you'll have us.

 Recently there was an attempt on the Hchste Kaiser's life. During a meeting with his parliament, a large car rammed itself through the front doors of the building and the driver attempted to detonate an explosive in the vehicle. Thankfully, the explosive didn't detonate and the bomber was captured. He is currently in custody and being questioned. Hopefully this was an individual attack and not a group effort. Any information will be extremely appreciated.  




 Liechtenstein would be honored to have France's legendary soldiers take part in the SHIT program. 




 Today, our great nation begins a program that will not only ensure our land's protection, but help efforts all over the world. This day marks the beginning of the Special Hunt and Infiltrate Trooper training program for the country's most elite military personnel. This elite team of soldiers will have the newest in prototype military technology and have the best training the country can offer. This is a great step forward for Liechtenstein's military and a great day for our country! 

Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 




 Hchste Kaiser will make an appearance. The yeti menace has terrorized the great nation of Liechtenstein for far too long. 




 I'm a a pretty big fan of Mike Litoris, myself. 




 I completely agree with you. I don't know what it is, but I find that the more affordable cars are a lot more interesting. 




 I wish they'd had the other characters you'd unlocked around the city fighting crime or something. That would've been badass. 




 With the return of Liechtenstein's money, the construction of the Great Wall of Liechtenstein will begin as planned in January of next year. However, without the help of the former dictator of Texas, a completion date is still unknown. But do not worry, people.  The continuity of this great nation is still of utmost importance to me.

Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 




 Thank you very much. 




 Return Liechtenstein's money and I will consider making an appearance at your silly concert. 




 Does Matt Greiner play guitar? 




 This year has been a stressful one for the great leader of Liechtenstein. The panic cause by the meteorite impact in Northern Africa forced Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 to close the border to all but the most important persons and events. Despite the crisis being solved, the leader remains cautious and has yet to reopen the borders to the rest of the world.

In other news, a **subway system** began construction. Everyone is extremely excited for the **subway** and hopes to be able to **travel the country quickly and in comfort** soon. Sadly the **subway** does not yet have a definite completion date, but stay tuned! 
(*Disclaimer*: **subway system** is definitely **not** a military bunker.)

On the topic of construction, the leader of our great nation also began construction of the Great Wall of Liechtenstein. This wall will surround the entire country and be fully armed with soldiers, artillery, etc. Sadly, did to the recent change in leadership in Texas, the previously expected help in building the wall seems to no longer be the case. This unexpected delay has caused this project, too, to no longer have an expected completion date.

On a related note, Hchste Kaiser expects Texas to, "Give me my money back. Like, now, guys. I mean... Come on."

Lastly, Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 has named the raspberry as Liechtenstein's national fruit. All citizens are now required to consume at least one raspberry every 6 hours in accordance with the laws set by the recently passed Freaking Delicious Act of 2018.

This concludes your once a year news source Hchste Kaiser's Word. Tune in next year for your only choice in Liechtenstein news!

Stay tuned for Sing-Along Disney Songs with Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 




 Why have I seen this same story in different formats so much these last couple of weeks? 




 Due to the recent change in leadership in Texas and unrealistically enthusiastic deadlines by our great leader, the **subway** that was planned no longer has a definite completion date. We **apologise to the citizens** and **hope they will be able to ride the rails** sooner than later.

Hchste Kaiser's Minister for Expansion 




 Yeah, that was just me being enthusiastic more than anything. It'll definitely be a while. 




 Either Notch or Lived a Lie by Codec 




 Oh, it definitely is **legit**. 




 Liechtenstein has begun construction of an underground **subway.** This amazing **transportation system** will run throughout the entire country and **be able to transport the citizens of Liechtenstein all over the country**! This is **in no way** a military base or a vault or anything of the sort! As a sneak peak, I am willing to say that the new **subways** will feature extremely large 3 ft thick gates that will stand around 20 ft high and be able to be withstand even the most powerful of **train collisions**! Isn't that fantastic? The **subway system** will also be going hundreds of feet below ground with multiple levels to **allow for more trains and routes**! Wow! To give you people an idea about the size, it may or may not be able to hold the majority if not all of the citizens of Liechtenstein in the event of a great **celebration** so everyone will be able to **party together**! Amazing! We anticipate that this **subway system** will be complete in a matter of 3-4 years and then **everyone** will be **allowed** to **ride the trains all over the country**!

 Liechtenstein 




 Holy shit. The fez thing. I know someone that wears one every day.  




 Ohmigawd you guys so I was on tumblr and everything they said even the stupid way they type without punctuation as if they were yelling and never taking a breath is just crazy and I'm literally dyING YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW 




 That has to be one of the shortest ever. I swear it lasted all of 3 days. 




 Wonderful. I've sent the funds. 




 Sir, you have your self a deal. Maybe we can even go one step further... And build both. 




 Preposterous. I won't pay a penny over $98M 




 Hmm, how large of a fee? 




 After reports of a multitude of people secretly entering the great nation of Liechtenstein despite the heavily enforced closed border rulings, I have decided that in order to keep the peace and integrity and ensure the defense and safety of this perfect nation and its citizens, a barrier must be built. The wall will stand 50 feet tall, be heavily defended, and surround the entire nation. This decision is not one made easily, but must happen in order to ensure the safety of my nation and its people in these unpredictable times. 

Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein, /u/test_subject7429 




 Social experiment? 




 Well... That's awkward because he's... Ah... Dead. 




 The newest leader of the great nation of Liechtenstein began his eternal term this year rather successfully. He was able to bring the country's military strength up well over what was necessary. When questioned, the Hchste Kaiser responded, "What the hell does 'moderation' mean?" The nation's great leader was then given a dictionary and, upon reading the definition, had the reporter publicly executed.

As of now, the nation's borders are still closed due to the bacterial crisis in Africa and will only be opened for reasons of the utmost importance.

In other news, the Hchste Kaiser has said that he won't nor will he ever recognize Duck Rights.

That's all for now, but tune in next year for Hchste Kaiser's Word. You're only choice in Liechtenstein national news.

 You guys are so cute together! 
























 [Meta] could we get dates next to the issues so we know which ones are current? 




 After numerous setbacks, the Great Wall of Liechtenstein is halfway to completion! Only the actual structure is halfway complete, the defenses and enforcements will take longer. The wall is expected to be completed in February of 2030. For now, the parts of the country that remain wall-less will be defended by a sturdy white picket fence. That is all.

Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein /u/test_subject7429 




 This year was rather in eventful for Liechtenstein.

Our eternal leader unveiled his joint project with France, the AT-23 Spectre Multi-Terrain Vehicle. This vehicle can be exported to any country willing to pay and only France and Liechtenstein hold the rights to manufacture them.

Second and lastly, Hchste Kaiser offered refuge to monsoon victims and offered supplies and refuge to all involved in the Argentina conflict.

This has been Hchste Kaiser's Word 2022. Tune in next year for your only yearly choice in national news.

Next: TV Static with Hchste Kaiser 




 Looks great, man! 




 Perfect. They'll arrive in 2 months. 




 Liechtenstein can build you AT-23 Spectre Multi-Terrain Vehicles for $600,000 each. 




 Then I assume we nominate/vote for new members. Though I don't know about anything since the chairman stepped down. 




 It's for the security council. Everyone can be in the alliance permanently, but the Sec Council has 3 permanent seats that have been voted on and 4 temporary ones that we vote on periodically.. 




 Liechtenstein would be honored to participate in this event. 




 Liechtenstein is deploying Spectres and SHIT squads all over the effected areas to help with rescue and relief efforts. We are also willing to take on a limited number of refugees and cooperate with other countries for more complicated relief operations. Finally, we'll be sending food, water, and medical supplies with the squads. 




 Liechtenstein will send a team of scientists and $500 million in support of this project. 




 The permanent seats are already filled though. And they're, you know, permanent. 




 Alright, then. We've sent all available scientists to help complete the project. 




 Liechtenstein would be willing to send scientists if not for a seat on the council then simply for the advancement of technology. 




 It was good, man 




 You can expect them in a month. 




 They should arrive within a month. 




 You should get them in a month. 




 You can expect them within the month. 




 The Hchste Kaiser had a chuckle. 




 Hchste Kaiser congratulates you on your coming to power and has sent you a 9x6 painting of himself. Stare at my beauty. 




 Liechtenstein is present and votes to officially recognize all proposed nations excluding Indonesia.

I would also like to propose that we discuss how to respond to various countries' (Iceland and Indonesia to name two) manufacturing of chemical weapons. 




 Today, Liechtenstein and France are proud to reveal the newest addition to their arsenal of military vehicles, the AT-23 Spectre. These lightly armored vehicles are capable of conquering even the roughest of terrain at a moderate speed in any weather. With brand new tire, shock, and suspension technology, this vehicle can go through much rougher terrain for longer periods of time than the older models. This vehicle will be able to hold up to 7 people, can support weapons attachments to the top of the vehicle, and is prepped for all environments. Liechtenstein is currently ready to mass produce and export to any country with any specifications. Average price per unit will be ~US$600,000. Currently only Liechtenstein and France hold the rights to build the AT-23 Spectre. 




 Aye for all four. 




 Sweet 




 Liechtenstein welcomes you to power and has sent you an invitation to he a guest judge on Liechtenstein's Next Top Model. Judge my women. 




 Question: as a normal member do I still have the ability to vote? Or is that just Security Council? 




 Liechtenstein congratulates your coming to power by sending you a jar of Hchste Kaiser's Own Raspberry Jam.  Spread it on your women. 




 I was ecstatic when I was able to find Liechtenstein! 




 To clarify, Liechtenstein is willing to take refugees from either side. 




 OK, thank you for clearing that up. 




 Due to lack of information, Hchste Kaiser has decided to refrain from armed participation in this conflict.  We are willing to take on refugees, but only a limited amount due to the size of our nation.  We will also be willing to deliver supplies to different countries depending on their standing with Liechtenstein. Besides that, Liechtenstein is taking no sides and will not participate in the actual fighting in this conflict.  

[Meta] Seriously, though, I have no idea what's going on or how this all started. 




 You will receive a formal invitation before the next season begins. 









 Oh, sweet! Thanks! 









 Welcome to your yearly programming of Hchste Kaiser's Word 2021! We're your new news team!

To start things off, the reason why we're here. At the beginning of the year, our great leader personally executed the previous mess team upon finding evidence that they were leaking confidential information to the terrorist organization that was attacking the country and other nations. He ended the executions stating that betrayal will never be tolerated.

On a lighter note, Liechtenstein announced the plans for its very own car company this year! So far all we know is that Kaiserwagen will be selling all over the world and will include cars of all types.

Next, the terrorist organization that had been attacking innocent civilians and government facilities has finally been out down. A defector informed The government of the organization's location and, upon further investigation, SHIT squads were sent in and all terrorists were either killed or captured. The next month after questioning, all captured members were personally executed by Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429. The organization's leader was never named.

Continuing military news, the government revealed its intentions to design and mass produce a new military all terrain vehicle. The vehicle is being designed in collaboration between Loechtenstein and France and is expected to begin mass production within this next year. Designs have yet to be released.

On a much sadder note, our great leader revealed that he had, until recently, forgotten his own title. And then, to add insult to injury, Hchste Kaiser offered diplomatic relations to a leader that was no longer in power. The whole country joined our great leader to wallow in depression for a few days.

Well, that wraps it up for Hchste Kaiser's Word, your only choice in Liechtenstein news. Tune in next year.

Next: Hchste Kaiser Dancing With the Stars 




 Hchste Kaiser greatly appreciates the company. 




 News travels to Liechtenstein very slowly. Hchste Kaiser has retired to his home and has once again, begun binge eating ice cream and Taco Bell. He invites all of the country to join him in his embarrassment. 




 Despite the controversy that the seizing of power has caused, we believe that the instant decision to declare war on your nation is a very rash decision. Therefore, Liechtenstein would like to extend its congratulations and hopes that, upon the reopening of the borders, Luxembourg would be willing to peacefully negotiate trade relations amongst other things with the people of Liechtenstein.

Hopefully,

Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein, /u/test_subject7429

Meta Edit: Shit. 




 Hchste Kaiser commends this decision from the AI. 




 ~Signed, Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein, /u/test_subject7429 




 Given Liechtentein and France's relations in the past, we'd be honored to join the ACE. 




 Devil and God's artwork is a photo by Nicholas Prior if you're interested. 




 As a welcome gift, Hchste Kaiser has sent you a minivan. Fill it with children. 




 Oh you! *blush* 




 [meta] well now I'm all excited to get home and do this. I hope my subpar drawing skills will be enough! 




 The Hchste Kaiser has just discovered that he has been spelling his own title wrong for years. He is currently in a fit of embarrassed depression, binge eating nothing but fast food and ice cream and watching Liechtenstein's Next Top Model. 




 [Meta] Exactly 




 Originally the time frame was to try and go into the mass production phase within one or two years (if that's realistic enough), but with your help it may be even faster. 

[meta] I'm planning on drawing something up when I get home later. 




 Liechtenstein accepts the offer. The investment and scientists will most certainly help speed up the research and prototype processes and help us move into the mass production phase much quicker. And of course, in exchange for the help, France gains the right to mass produce them on their own. 




 [meta] Mine is more of a Humvee than an AFV. Only like 1,000,000x cooler.  




 Excellent. We'll inform you as soon as your vehicles have been prepared.  




 We're planning on the vehicles to be lightly armored, most likely able to carry six people (maybe multiple sizes), able to support light weapons attachments, and we're researching new tire, shock, and suspension technology that can last longer and withstand rougher terrain. These vehicles can be painted however the receiving government sees fit and will arrive ready for operations. 




 ~signed, Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein, /u/test_subject7429 




 Liechtenstein actually just announced its intentions to create a new all terrain vehicle for their own military. We'd be willing to export to you once production begins. 




 Liechtenstein has sent a German shepherd as a congratulatory gift for your coming to power. Pet him or offend me. 




 Starting next month Kaiserwagen will begin designing and producing all terrain vehicles for Loechtenstein's military. We hope for a lightly armored vehicle that can hold at least six men and support attachable firearms. These vehicles will, in theory, be able to maneuver Liechtenstein's mountainous terrain much easier than our current vehicles. Along with the vehicles, Kaiserwagen will be researching a new form of tire that will be more durable and last much longer in the rough terrain. Liechtenstein is accepting help with designs and has plans to export to anyone that inquires. 




 Good. Let our positive relations begin. 




 This is nothing new. Hchste Kaiser has personally executed many prisoners. Mostly those that have made personal threats or attacks on him. 




 Today, Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 personally executed every captured member of the terrorist organization that had formerly been attacking innocents for well over a year. After the capture of their leader and the disbanding of the group, they were kept away from the public and questioned for just over a month. Early this morning, a verdict was reached and it was announced that they were all to be executed. At noon, all men, looking battered and beaten, were lined up and, one by one, shot by our eternal leader. The final execution was that of the organization's leader. His name was never released to the public. Hchste Kaiser explained right after executing the man that his name will never be public knowledge because, "He did not deserve the satisfaction of a legacy." 




 Hchste Kaiser welcomes you and has sent you a basket of many breads. Enjoy its wheaty goodness. 




 Hchste Kaiser despises the color yellow. 




 Liechtenstein is interested in joining. 




 What's the difference between small front overlap and moderate front overlap? 




 It is with great joy that I personally announce the end of the never-named terrorist group that attacked facilities and civilians all over the country. With the help of a defector from the group, we located their base of operations and SHIT squads were immediately sent in. The group was found to be much smaller then we had anticipated, just over 50 members. 

SHIT squads were met with gunfire upon entry and the majority of the group was killed in the ensuing firefight. The remaing 17 members, the still-anonymous leader included, were captured and taken to an undisclosed location for interrogation. Once questioning is through, punishment will be dispatched posthaste. Terrorism and betrayal to the nation won't nor will it ever be tolerated and the punishments these men receive will be just and deserved.

I personally invite all citizens of our great nation to celebrate with me. On this momentous day, a group of murderers was put to an end. Finally, we can rest and our country can return to the prosperity it knew before.

~Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 




 Liechtenstein commends you for the way you think. 




 Hchste Kaiser has sent an annoyingly large bouquet of flowers as congratulations for your coming to power. Smell them or insult me. 




 Ok, I gotcha. I hope that's just as fun for you as being a country! 




 Well color me confused. 




 [Meta] So are you Madagascar again? 




 Hchste Kaiser has sent a pig in congratulations for your coming into power. Eat it. 




 Liechtenstein is authoritarian and capitalist. 




 Liechtenstein is interested in joining the alliance because it is against socialism. If its government ever becomes an issue, we are willing to leave. 




 For f***ing yourself or authoritarianism? 




 Hchste Kaiser has sent finger foods as congratulations for you (finally) coming to power. Eat them or hurt my feelings. 




 Hchste Kaiser has sent an assorted cheese platter as congratulations for you coming to power. Eat it or become my enemy. 




 Hchste Kaiser kindly tells your alliance to go f*** itself.  




 Sith Lord of Korriban is best lord of Korriban 




 How does the alliance feel towards authoritarianism? 




 Highest GDP per person, broOOoOOo 




 You don't got nothin' bro. Just silly accents. 




 NEW ENGLAND SUUUUUUCKS!!! 




 Hchste Kaiser is forever thankful of your gift. I will raise them as my own and train them to be my heirs upon my extremely unlikely death. We hope this means positive negotiations far into the future between our two great nations. 




 Go kick his ass and tell him that Madagascar is nothing without a leader 




 Kaiserwagen's catalogue will include all kinds of cars from the consumer minivan to super cars designed by the country's top engineers that will soon be available for purchase by people all over the world. Hchste Kaiser has given the company his blessing and hopes for its success in the long run. 




 Do it. You'll be immune to all diseases forever!! 




 What will happen to Baobabia now? 




 Mine was already there. Sorry, I just felt bad for not filling mine out yet. 




 Hchste Kaiser has sent a fruit bouquet as a congratulatory gift. Eat it or offend me. 




 You just reminded me that I need to fill mine out. I'll do that soon. 
























 Liechtenstein thanks you for your support. 




 Wait, wait, wait, wait. You are putting a "police force" in my borders without my permission... And this *isn't* a declaration of war? 




 Currently, Liechtenstein is in a state of war, but as soon as the conflict ends, we would gladly sell you equipment. 




 Yep. I'll have my wiki updated by the end of the day. 




 Liechtenstein is asking the EMU for help/intervention since this declaration of war by Poland, another EMU member, is unjust. Tuva ceded Kaliningrad to Liechtenstein fairly. If Poland had indeed been in negotiations with both the former NSF and Tuva (which Liechtenstein was unaware of) they obviously saw the nation as unfit to lead the territory and chose not to cede it to them or else they would already have it. Liechtenstein tried to make agreements with Poland upon hearing about their interest in Kaliningrad and they took the first deal. I request that Poland be removed from the EMU and other member nations help Liechtenstein in this conflict.

[meta] And let's be realistic. I have one of the smallest countries in Europe. I really can't win this on my own. He has at least two people blindly following him without question. 




 [meta] Actually, Sealand got claimed around a week after I annexed it. I think the claimer is inactive, but i never re-annexed it, so I only have Kaliningrad. Sorry I haven't updated my wiki. I have to research a little more on my military now since its grown a lot with Kaliningrad and I have work in an hour.

Edit: in fact, I just checked the unclaimed countries list and Sealand is on it.  




 And the acid rain. 




 As leader of Liechtenstein, I am taking this moment to formally announce the conclusion of negotiations for the joining together of our two regions! Kaliningrad will remain the name of the Capitol, but the exclave itself will be Knigsberg. In recent years, the economy and population of Knigsberg have been falling, but Liechtenstein is hoping to boost its economy by making it Liechtenstein's center for overseas trade. On top of that, we will also be taking advantage of its amber deposits, fishing, boat, and auto industry, and tourism to boost the economy as well.

Liechtenstein has also made a deal with Poland to insure safe passage of goods to and from our ports in exchange for a percentage of goods that enter and leave the area. 




 I guess I'm just thinking in US terms. There are so many more automatic cars in the US, even older ones. 




 Maybe because they're making more cars automatic or with paddle shifters?  




 We understand and thank you! 




 Liechtenstein would like to invest in the hologram projects. We feel this is a great step forward in communication technology and would like to see it become the norm. 




 Liechtenstein would like to negotiate the annexation of Kaliningrad Oblast since it is an exclave and not connected to the main land of Russia.

Its name will most likely become the previous name of its capital, Knigsberg while the capital will remain Kaliningrad. 

Its population sits at just over 940,000 at the moment and its GDP is about US$14,000 per capita. Unfortunately, both have been falling. Liechtenstein hopes to reverse this buy boosting investors and helping with overall quality of life.

The population is currently 86% Russian with the rest being made up of various Eastern European demographics. 

We hope to make use of its ice-less ports and make it Liechtenstein's center for sea trade. We also hope to utilize its tourism, amber deposits, fishing industry, and boat and auto manufacturing to continue to boost its own economy and help our own. 




 The Kaiser gladly accepts the Freefold's huggies. 




 Liechtenstein is formally offering SHIT squads and other aid to all affected countries that request it and is joining in the search to end this terrible group.

Anyone who needs assistance need only ask.

Edit: I misspelled my title and am sad. 




 Liechtenstein is willing to send SHIT squads to all who request it. 




 Yeah, I'm struggling for ideas as well. 




 They'll arrive ready for operations in approximately one month. 




 Liechtenstein and France jointly developed an off-road reconnaissance and transport vehicle, the AT-23 Spectre.  (http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/25mxbk/event_liechtenstein_and_france_reveal_at23/).  The base price is US$600,000 per vehicle and they will arrive ready for use. 




 Hey, now. Don't start this. 




 Despite all efforts put into monthly searches for Bogeymen, we have come up with nothing.  This is a sad failure on my own part and I apologize.  However, simply finding nothing does not disprove the existence of the Bogeyman.  He is a wily beast and Liechtenstein will immediately begin researching new ways to catch him as our previous ways are archaic and outdated.  Do not worry, citizens, this beast will be caught. 




 The aircraft will take off and land vertically, but the rotors will be able to turn to allow the aircraft to maneuver and move quickly.  When the rotors have been turned a full 90 degrees the aircraft is predicted to be able to reach speeds of over 100 knots, however, the horizontal speed isn't the main goal. The main goal is to have a veihicle that can hover and provide air support and recon in combat zones and be able to arrive and leave the combat zone quickly along with being stealthier than current VTOLs (Sort of a get in, get out type vehicle). The aircraft will be piloted by two men and be armed with a 20 mm Gatling gun at the nose and hold eight MIRV-style rockets for anti-armor and building attacks. More information will be released as research continues. So far the research is expected to take between eighteen months and two years. 









 We can only hope. 




 All beds are to be overturned quickly in attempts to surprise the Bogeymen and all closets are to be prodded around in with a stick or stick-like object. When asked about this strange mandate, Hchste Kaiser would only explain that he was afraid and that this menace needed to be stopped. This procedure is to be performed on the 2nd of every month beginning next year. 




 I'm here and I'll be trying to be more active than the past few weeks. 




 Not much has happened in the past year. Our great leader's only public declaration was to make vaccines mandatory for all citizens. However, he has promised to be a much more active leader in the coming years.  




 Liechtenstein would like 10,000 for US$800 million. 




 Sorry, guys. Not her.

 We understand. We'd still be happy to provide a donation to speed research up. This is a technology that we're very interested in. 




 [meta] Haha! [/meta] 




 From here and onward, all citizens of Liechtenstein are required to receive  vaccines. Those who refuse will be quarantined until they agree to be vaccinated. People wishing to immigrate to Liechtenstein are now required to show proof of vaccination. If they have not been vaccinated, they will be given one week to be vaccinated or risk deportation. 




 Liechtenstein would love to help finance and research this project in exchange for rights to continue research and manufacture upon the project's completion. We're prepared to offer US$10 billion and a team of researchers. This combined with Liechtenstein's current personnel armor would be a great step in military advancement. 




 Welcome back, man! 




 Liechtenstein: Present

**Resolution #0004:** Nay

**Membership:** Aye 




 Liechtenstein and France are proud to announce the completion of their newest advancement in military technology! After some setbacks, the fully customizable Titan Infantry Armor is being mass produced and used by France and Liechtenstein and is for sale for approximately US$5,000 per suit.

Quick description: The armor is made of a weave of spectra fiber and Kevlar, is made up of paintable panels on a suit that can be added or removed for added mobility/protection, and the armor is fully customizable to the wearer's ability. The second part of the armor is the helmet. It is made of the same materials, covers the entire head, features an HUD that displays location, weapon, and other information, an eye piece with zooming, night vision, and other abilities, and can be fitted with a gas mask and oxygen supply.

Once again, each suit is also available for export to any country under any specification and will arrive combat-ready for US$5,000 or more depending on specs.

 France said he'd be a little inactive this week. That's probably why you haven't seen him much. 




 Sweet 




 Sorry I've been so inactive. I should be able to start posting regularly again within the week. 




 I get it. I completely agree. 




 Is that partly because of Beartooth's last few tours? Because the last two times I saw them they were with ABR and BTF, and then MMF. 




 Liechtenstein relinquishes power to you.

Meta: I didn't see this yesterday. Welcome to the game :) 




 I'm still here. 




 YEESSSS 




 [Meta] Hah, it's no problem. [/meta]  




 We apologize for the inconvenience. If we ever decide to dominate the Earth and more space becomes available, we'll inform you first. 




 Considering that's over 800% of our population, I'm not entirely sure of that's possible. 




 O ja 




 It's good to be back. However, the influx of new people makes me nervous. 




 Over 6 years ago, due to threats to the nation and the world, Hchste Kaiser closed the country's borders and only allowed those on important business to enter, and even then, only after extensive security precautions were taken. Today, though, the great leader of Liechtenstein reopened the borders for public travel and immigration! Hchste Kaiser was asked what made him finally decide to reopen and was quoted saying, "I forgot to open them after a few months..." 

Well, today anyone with a passport may now enter Liechtenstein for whatever reason they please, be it the scenery, our famous jam covered women, or simply to worship our wonderful leader!

**Disclaimer:** Not all women in Liechtenstein are covered in jam. 









 Everyone is job in Liechtenstein.

 Alright, I'll admit I was wrong in the way I reacted. 




 I didn't say I didn't know. 




 I was upset because he wasn't backing it up, he just denied what the others were saying. Not because I wanted to actually know. 




 There. That's all I wanted. You're right. Thank you. 




 I did? 




 Why don't you actually back it up instead of arguing the same way my 12 year old brother does? 




 You can put your flair on yourself in the sidebar. Just so people know your title and what country you represent. 




 Liechtenstein's 6+ year effort, the former subway station turned bunker is finally complete! This bunker is, for now, to be used for research and storage of government rations, weapons, vehicles, etc., but its true purpose is in fact a shelter in the event of a nuclear holocaust/meteor strike/other threat to all life on earth. Due to Liechtenstein's small population, the bunker is equipped to sustain a good portion of Liechtenstein's citizens for years. 

Guarded by a large blast-proof gate, it is equipped with living quarters, water purifiers, air filters, environment suits, research and medical facilities, a command center, and more. Despite Liechtenstein's readiness, we truly hope that this bunker's true purpose is never actually needed. The bunker is also equipped with office space and storage facilities for Mann Co. Liechtenstein will always be willing to expand the bunker to make space for any country that is willing to pay and aide in the development. 

The bunker is also home to a large meeting room and living quarters to allow for lengthy meetings between multiple world leaders to discuss business in a much safer and more private setting. 




 What about Liam Neeson simply as Dad 




 I couldn't stop laughing when he started talking. 




 Perfect. 




 If you help fund, we would be willing to send you part of the first batch of suits when they're finished. 




 Liechtenstein has been working on a bunker for years. We may be willing to negotiate expanding to allow for a small amount of space for Mann Co. 




 Liechtenstein and France have begun planning a new type of lightweight armor for military personnel. The armor will be made of a light plating sections attached to a suit. The material being used is a weave of spectra fiber and Kevlar. The plates will be separated along the suit to allow for easy mobility, but it'll be possible to add plates for situations where less mobility and more armor are necessary.  If this is successful, the armor ahould be able to resist a moderate amount of small arms fire and withstand anything less. The plates will also be camouflaged to allow for tactical use in any environment. The armor itself will be able to be upgraded and customized as the wearer sees fit.

Along with the suit, we will also be developing a helmet made of the same materials that covers the entire head and face of the soldier. These helmets will be fitted with a radio, a heads up display displaying information on the location (elevation, coordinates, temperature, etc.), an eye piece that allows for night vision, thermal, telescopic, etc., and in some cases, the helmets will be fitted with an oxygen supply. More information will be released if more research is deemed necessary.

This research is expected to take, if all goes according to plan, around 18 months.

As usual, this technology will be available for export upon completion and beginning of mass production.

Edit: some more stuff 




 We forgive you. 




 DO NOT QUESTION THE MOTIVES OF LIECHTENSTEIN! 




 Liechtenstein requests that this rail system goes through our nation. We are prepared to offer labor in return. 




 Liechtenstein's delegates have succeeded in negotiating the annexation of the micro nation known as Sealand. For the time being, Sealand will serve as an Atlantic watch post, small boat rest area, and marine study facility until future plans are complete. 




 Establishing a better relationship with our close neighbors is definitely in Liechtenstein's best interests. We will consider this. 




 Liechtenstein feels that a more permanent relationship between itself and France would definitely be beneficial. Especially after already experiencing working with France. 




 Liechtenstein is looking for a more permanent partner (or partners) to continue helping with military equipment research. This would also open a permanent free trade agreement between Liechtenstein and the country in question and Liechtenstein promises to help that country in its own endeavors. The first project will most likely be Light Personell Armor. 




 ~Signed, Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein, /u/test_subject7429 




 Hchste Kaiser is happy to attend 




 You're not alone. That movie is the shit. 




 As we said before, Liechtenstein fears no one. However, this expansion isn't militaristic. At least not at this moment. 




 Liechtenstein fears no one. 




 Liechtenstein has sent a diplomat to the teeny tiny nation of Sealand to discuss joining together our two great nations.  




 We'll send all available workers to aide in the construction immediately. 




 Liechtenstein could help you in planning and building this barrier. We have a lot of experience in wall building. 




 It's the Great North Land I think. 




 Though I fully trust my citizens, I agree. BACKGROUND CHECKS: REAPPLIED! 




 Liechtenstein is a fully militarized country. All citizens are trained soldiers and I trust them to the fullest. 




 [Meta] I'm pretty sure news posts aren't to be used unless its Sunday. 




 Hchste Kaiser has hereby made all firearms legal to privately own. Citizens no longer need background checks or any form of identification to own different types of firearms. All firearms minus government weaponry are now available to the public. Hchste Kaiser has also proclaimed April 12th to be national Go Shoot Things Day. All citizens are required by law to participate in this holiday. All of these rules have been implemented in the newly passed You Get a Gun, You Get a Gun, Everyone Gets a Gun! Act of 2023.

Edit: HCHSTE KAISER RETRACTS THE NO BACKGROUND CHECKS PART 




 I'm active! 




 Thanks!
