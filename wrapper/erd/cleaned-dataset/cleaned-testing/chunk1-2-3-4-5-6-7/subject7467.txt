 Is there any websites that you can buy dogecoin from? I'm pretty new to the cryptocurrencies thing  




 so I have my wallet and cgminer downloaded. What do I do now? I have no idea what to do in cgminer and i feel like all the videos and tutorials are above my head. Help me mine like i was your grandmother. 




 I don't know anything about processors at all. Here is my laptops specs http://www.cnet.com/laptops/hp-pavilion-dv7-3165dx/4507-3121_7-33970190.html  I have CPUminer downloaded already. I understand I wont make anything but I'm cool with that. 









 I'MMA MAKE IT RAYNE!

EDIT: OOOO IMMA BUY ME A PADDED TOILET SEAT COVER!

EDIT2: HOW DO I MAKE MOAR DOGECOIN?!? 




 How and where do I get started? 




 OOOOOO MAMA here's my address 1KGA1tmajhZV4kHyxrk1WPSuYTwBGL79YM 




 So I downlooaded electrum earlier today after heaqring some of my friends talk about bitcoins. I googled websites that payout small amounts of coins and tried those. I just copied one of my recieving addresses and pasted it in the website. Does it take time to show a transaction? 
























 Found out my local bookshop has a magic section yesterday. Bought a book called mastering witchcraft. I've never been into witches and magic but the bible mentions them and if god is real and the bible is his word would witchcraft not also be real? If it is real how do I summon things and get super rich? 




 My friends and I have been wanting to play dungeons and dragons but none of us have played before. I bought a dungeon master book today but understand I need a lot more. I can ring beer to a group if you're willing to teach me how to play.  




 I've brought her over twice now. The first time they avoided and hissed. This time they are still hissing but they don't seem to be avoiding each other as much. I've lived with dogs before and other people would bring their dogs over all the time. I know dogs are pack animals but will my cat ever get along with other cats if they only ever meet sporadically?  




 This is probably like the third semester I'm gonna fail. I just don't care about school. I know I need a degree for a good future or whatever but I just for want to do it. I'm totally happy just working. I love my job. I just can't do school right now. I've already told my mom I'm taking time off I'm just nervous to tell my dad. When I graduated high school I never thought this would happen. I've gone from an a student with scholarships to a college dropout and I don't care. I've been in meds for about a year but I've stopped going to therapy because I didn't feel that I needed it anymore. I'm happy but I hate school. I guess there's no point to this post I just wanted to talk to some people who have been through something similar maybe.  














 I'm in my fourth year of college. I haven't had a good semester yet. I just have no desire to go to school. I'm a biology major and have no idea what I would do with it when and if I graduate. All I really want to do is take some time off and discover myself, but that sounds so cliched and pathetic. I haven't seen my therapist in about a month but I've been keeping up with my meds. There isn't really a question I just wondered if anyone else has been down this path before.  









 I was debating this with a friend earlier. Does the butane in a lighter not completely turn into CO2 and H2O when it's lit? Or does some butane not combust? 









 I have a drumset with hardware and cymbals that I would like to sell and was wondering where I could most likely get the most money.  




 I know one day I'll move and I don't know what I'll do with my self if I can't buy family packs.  




 So I'm in my 4th year of college and I hate it. I'm a bio major and really don't want to do bio related stuff. I'm thinking of taking a semester off and trying to find a hobby or something I want to go to school for. I feel like I can major in anything I want to because I'm still just gonna be working shit jobs when I get out and anything that requires a degree needs just that. A degree. I don't think it matters what kind they just want to see a degree.  














 And more importantly who would win? What would the major consequences be? 




 I've struggled with depression for years and have been on medication for the last year. Subsequently my school work has suffered. I'm entering my fourth year of college and I'm still about a year and a half to two years away from a degree. I've bounced between several majors with my current being biology. I feel like my depression is under control now and I'm really happy with my life, but I have no idea why I'm going to school. I don't care about biology and don't plan to do anything with a degree. I just feel like I'm pissing money away for a stupid piece of paper. I also feel like I'm pretty close and might as well just get a bio degree just to have a degree.  



















 It's probably just over thinking, but what do y'all think.  




 I wanted I write something about an average twenty something living in the time the first space elevator is completed. How it would affect his life and the resulting explosion of space travel.

 So I've been in lexapro for about seven months now. It's done an incredible job for me. I feel like a new person, except for one thing. It takes me forever to ejaculate now. It makes sex really tiring and frustrating. I can feel the build up but it vanishes several times. Has anyone had a similar experience and what did you do? 









 My rabbit doesn't seem to like people that much. He doesn't mind if you pet him but he generally likes to be left alone. Is this just his personality or can I encourage him to come up to us while he is out for some love?

 I live in the mesquite ridge townhouses and I see this cat all the time. Super friendly but it has no tags. I was wondering if anyone knew anything about it. I can't afford to help it if its stray but it's such a nice cat 









 My therapist recently suggested a family group therapy session. Has anyone had an experience like this? Ideally I would like it to be me my mom my dad and my sister. My moms and dad only talk when necessary. I have no idea why they split and I think finding out like that would be very beneficial. I'm worried about tempers flaring and feelings get hurt and irreprebale emotional damage. 

  




 Sometimes I can't find all my subreddits on the sidebar. Any fixes? 




 Has anyone else had nightmares about their jeans? It sounds so strange but last night i dreamed it was time to clean my jeans, so I got in my car and started cleaning them with a sponge and water and turned on the heater so they would dry. I had horrible horrible dream fades. I also dreamed I put mine in the washing machine and the came out baby blue. 




 So i've been on lexapro for a few months and in the past couple weeks i got real lazy on taking it at the same time, which led to me missing days and eventually just not taking it when I ran out. I started skipping or cancelling my therapy sessions during this time as well. I think it's because of this that I let my school work slip and now I am failing all my classes. IT all culminated in a breakdown on thursday where i really wasnt sure what I was going to do. Suicide kept racing through my mind so instead I went on a long drive to try and gather my thoughts. In my car I found some papers from my therapy sessions and i read "Is the way you're thinking now going to help your situation"? Suddenly a light went off and I realized I needed to be an adult. So i've been back on the meds for a week and feel so much better. My only problem now is school, which my parents paid for. I plan to tell them very soon that I messed up school because I got off my meds. I'm going to offer to pay them back for this semester and pay for all subsequent schooling my self. I'm also prepared to give my car back to them. I work and pay for my own housing in a city where I dont need a car, so i think i can make it without the car and on my own if i have too. I might have to take a year off school for academic probation which is really scary to me. Has anyone been in a similar situation? I'm just wondering if what im doing is the right and responsible thing. I feel like it is since i was doing well on the meds and I screwed myself over by getting off. 




 I want text from the feminist perspective and men's rights perspective. 




 I stopped smoking a month after a mental breakdown of sorts. I've started going to therapy, was diagnosed with depression and have started antidepressants. I'm really excited for 2013. I feel like this will finally be the year I get my life together. 









 I got some cdbs for Christmas and was wondering if anyone had put  orthotics in theirs. they don't have a removable insole and I usually only put mine in shoes that do. 









 I don't care what the stupid people you know think. This subreddit is for serious discussion and if you want to be taken seriously use serious sources. /rant 




 Today I finally told my dad about all the mental problems I've had my whole life. I get stressed and depressed super easily, always feel anxious and have panic attacks and I know I've gotten more withdrawn as years go by. I can't keep up with school and work because I get overwhelmed and give up. I've been sent to therapy twice, once after my parents divorce and after I was kicked out of my universitys housing for paraphernalia charges. I never talked to the therapy either time and i'm really nervous about it. I've never opened up emotionally to anyone before and i'm scared I won't be able to. And what if I do and they tell me i'm just lazy and everything is my fault. Sorry if this is long and doesn't make sense. I would just like to heat from someone who has been in this situation. 




 I got caught in an unexpected light shower today. I've taken really good care of my denim and I don't want them to randomly be ruined.

 A lot of the winter and fall clothes I see look too heavy for texas. We get maybe one week of really cold weather. Most of the styles here seem like they would work better in a northeastern climate. I was just looking for some examples of clothing that would work in our climate. 



















 I understand that it's strictly theoretical at this point, but why all the recent buzz? if it was proven at a small scale what applications could we expect. I'm assuming actual warp drives are still years away, but could this research lead to energy or weapons breakthroughs? 




 I'm open to any suggestions. I like my hair long, but its so thick and curly I don't know how to style it. Any product or haircut suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 




 I was kicked out of kerr for paraphernalia my freshman year and I would like to offer incoming freshman some tips.

1 Never, ever, ever leave anything in your car. That's how I got caught. Dogs can smell a one hitter in your car.
 
2 Never leave anything in your dorm.
 
3 Make friends off campus and stash your pieces there. This is the easiest and best thing to do.
 
4 Avoid campus when you're riding dirty, especially north Texas avenue. Campus police love pulling people over.
 
5 If you are caught you will be kicked out of  the dorms, so be prepared. You will also have to go through substance abuse counseling.

6 smoke joints. They leave no evidence.

7 Avoid bike cops. They are the worst.

Feel free to post your advice here or ask questions. I want to help as many people as I can avoid what I went through.

 My roommate has gotten in to eastern spirituality lately and told me yesterday that philosophy was shit. Obviously I'm not going to win a debate with someone who believes in chakra.systems and martians, but.i was wondering if anyone had done reading I could recommend to him. plato meets a platypus got me into philosophy but he thinks it's a childish book that shows how dumb philosophy is.   Edit: I suppose I should mention that he takes acid every two weeks so he.might be fried.

 I have given my rats plenty of comfy spots to sleep, but every time I walk in they are sleeping on the ground. anyone else have rats like this? 




 So I've smoked dmt a handful of times but only broke through three times. Of those three times, twice I found myself in a large room made of colors/patterns where I watched this woman made of the same colors dance. has anyone had a similar experience? 




 Currently i am on a oral prescription for ketaaconazle and For the past week or so, every time I smoke weed I get a strange visual distortion in the center of my vision.

 So I'm over a foot taller than my girlfriend and I also have an above average penis and it seems like not every position works, particularly rear entry. I was just who seeing if anyone else had similar problems and what we could do. 














 So I have a roommate who seriously believes in crystal healing. There are  rocks all over our place arranged in "energy grids". I was wondering if anyone had any super effective counter arguments. I've already told him that if quartz crystal is magic then all technology would be magic since quartz is silica and I've pointed out the complete lack of scientific proof. He just claims its my masculine energy and western biases that are clouding my mind. 




 I'm currently a business marketing major, but I find it dull and unfulfilling. I've always loved science and nature and I believe I can do something good with a biology degree. I was just wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation and what you decided.

 After seeking treatment for depression and being on meds for two years I'm off and feeling great! My only problem is I feel like I can't focus. I'm more distracted and know for a fact my attention span and memory are not the same. Has anyone else experienced something similar? I have been off lecapro for a few months now also. 




 Where does this leave me? I fundamentally agree with communism and Marxism, but the violent employed by lenin and stalin are appalling to me. How can you justify slave labor and famine as means of control? It seems like I can't be a pacifist communist. Would I just be a socialist then? 




 I am looking for readings about feminism. I figure there had to be some people who have a real knowledge about it, not just stuff they picked up on a blog, in this sub.

 And communism as well. I understand there aren't a lot of communists, but in my view almost all the worlds problems are socioeconomic. If we lived in an equal society we wouldn't need mens rights or feminism. I used to think that was the goal of both groups, but now I think they want to be better than each other. Both want their gender to dominate. It just seems odd and at ends with the origins of both movements. 




 Obviously we are gonna lose some people along the way. But basically we should breed bears to be smaller so we could keep them as pets. That would be easier than domestication. If they were like bobcat sized that would be awesome. 




 Why did he make the war on drugs can suck my cock? 









 So my prescription ran out like two weeks ago and I haven't been able to go see my doctor since then. First week was terrible. I had gotten off on my medication I've before during the two years I have been on them so I knew roughly what to expect. I thought I could get them this past week, but my new job and school didn't give me any time to go to my hometown doctor. So now it's been a fee weeks and I feel again. The brain zaps have stopped too. I am supposed to start therapy again soon, but now I don't want to go back on meds. I feel good. I.didn't realize I was.zombied while on meds. I've felt so many emotions lately and it's great. Had anyone experienced something similar? I'm seeing my doctor tomorrow and I don't know if I want to start meds again.

 I was watching cosmos last night and NDT described the knowledge that all things are made of star stuff as spiritual. I've always immediately dismissed the word spiritual or anything people claim as spiritual. Now that I'm older I feel that spirituality doesn't have to be incompatible with atheism, but I don't know how they can coexist. Thoughts? How do you define your spirituality? Is it something intrinsically human that we as atheists are trying to suppress?  




 He's upset with me right now for two warrants I have out for unpaid parking tickets. No reason I didn't pay them, just that I just didn't care about them. He's been telling me I need to get it together and I know he's right. I'm just too embarrassed to call because I haven't taken cars of the warrants yet and blew all my money this week.  




 So I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for two years now. I've also been on medication and attended therapy. I feel like I've made no progress. And I'm tired of it. Lately I've had the thought of taking shrooms or acid to see if that helps my depression. I've read lots of anecdotal trip reports where people claim if helped with theirs. I have experimented with psychedelics before, but never more than stupid swaying or mild visuals? Has anyone had the type of experience I'm looking for? 



















 I really like warframe, but my biggest complaint is a lack of storytelling. The Tenno universe is so cool, but the only story you really get is occasional chatter from bosses. I wish DE would expand on the story more.  









 Preferably more recent writing that talk about 21st century communism? That might not make sense but I'm new to communism. It just seems that a lot of the suggested readings are a bit dated. Not that it makes them invalid, I was just looking for a modern interpretation.  



















 The contestants would have to find a new romantic partner and keep the relationship going. The partners can't know anything about the show. The contestant that manages to stay in their relationship the longest will split a large sum of money with their partner 70-30 for the contestant; if the contestant breaks up with their partner upon learning they are the last contestant. The contest could go on for years, with deep intimate bonds forming. If they don't break up they win nothing. This contest will only attract terrible, terrible people. Which will make great tv.  




 I've been on lexapro for a year and a half now. I've been to therapy as well and I feel good now. Im starting a great job this week where I'll make at least three times what I make now. I'm also going back to school in the fall to get a degree in something I like. I know I need to talk to my doctor and gradually taper off, but what was it like when you stopped medication?

 I have something crucial to sing about! Lol. If it really was important you wouldn't sing it.  




 Well I don't think everyone in the world uses botnets like these hackers do to hack in to psn.  




 Duh. Their stuff is shit, and your shit is stuff.  




 Right. So it's a tool hackers use, but it's not hacking. Square and rectangles man.  




 Are they not exploiting network weaknesses? 




 But this poor multi billion dollar company who had been hacked multiple times just within this last month did nothing wrong and obviously had the best network security. There is nothing they could do, since this is soooo unprecedented 




 The animation for it is much better than the knife, especially if you get them from behind

 Why? If any other business messes up their product I expect something from them in return. A restaurant messes up my meal and it's free. Why is Sony different?

 It's still their product.
