 Boobs. 




 Is that just, like.. A big bowl of meat?? 




 At first I wasn't sure about this compilation but by the end of course I had tears in my eyes. A unique version of a "Most Heartwarming/Heartbreaking Photos" collection, I thought it was pretty touching. 




 Mind over matter; what a crazy wild thing! 




 I LOVED this book when I was little and currently still love it. I found it again at a yard sale last year and all my positive childhood memories came rushing back!  




 Seconded: go see a doctor and they'll give you the answers to these questions but seriously dude this is not an area to take any medical chances with in my opinion.

Likely it's a rash from some kinda soap or clothing or whatever, but you're best bet is to have the doctor tell you that and get it cleared up before it gets worse.  




 Lemons; some full and some cut in half. The full ones can be thrown at people and the cut in half ones can be squeezed into peoples eyes mwahahaha! You walk in with your lemons, attack anyone who gets in your way, blind everyone with lemon juice, and walk out with the diamonds!

Edit: oops got caught up in the fantasy and forgot it was a has station. So instead you walk out with the CASH and CANDY!! 




 This is the perfect type of question to ask the people over at r/outoftheloop :)

you should try posting there if you are confused about something and looking to to get an explanation.  




 We can't stop here; this is bat country! 
























 its ok that you really liked her and now you miss her even if she wasnt in your life that long. i get it; it happens. thats just something you are going to have to give yourself time to get over and move on. 

On the other hand it sounds like the girl has some issues of her own that she is dealing with; trust, commitment, not knowing who she is or what she wants (all hypothetical of course but she was obviously flipflopping at the very least based on this tiny impression you gave on her) so this might just be for the best. 

keep in mind; you didnt end anything on bad terms, take your time and go easy on yourself and try to find some fun distractions in the meantime is my advice. you said you have gone on other dates, so you will clearly have new options, keep an open mind and you never know what will happen.

you should maybe post this over at r/advice or r/relationships because i feel they would be more inclined to give in-depth advice at those types of subs. 




 so but who gets that donut? 




 the home depot logo makes it particularly classy ;) 




 its gross but ive probably gone like 1-2 weeks when im in a bout of depression; they get all stained up (mostly by coffee and cigarettes) and they feel grimy in my mouth. Also plaque builds up, which is the only thing that isnt fixed once i start brushing again (thank god for whitening toothpaste). 

when i start back with the brushing and flossing i also notice all the space and holes between my teeth which i couldnt feel at all during the non-brushing weeks, and notice the food stuck in between them immediate. so the less you floss your teeth, the less it feels like you even have to floss, cuz your teeth are all clogged up with grime.

i feel like i talked for way too long about this gross personal subject. im going to hit save before i change my mind completely.

 my highschool had "math for everyday life" which was supposed to be the remedial math class, but was probably the most useful class for highschool students since it taught you how to understand and calculate mortgages, bank ( /other) loans and interest rates, how do understand and do your income ( /other) taxes; stuff that people actually need to know to be an adult. I thought that was pretty good, too bad it was only supposed to be for the "dumb" kids cuz im pretty sure everyone would benefit from that type of class... 




 highschool sweetheart: we were both too immature to particpate in a real relationship. we are friends now and have talked about how different it would have been if we were both mature adults. our relationship was technically "off and on" because we broke up over every (stupid) fight but became "official" again shortly thereafter, rinse and repeat for 2-3 years. lots of jealousy and dumb arguments, that type of shit.

 leave it; its his closet now. 




 WHOA WHOA WHOA that was some cold shit outta nowhere..!

..Wait maybe the ex learned to read and write? 




 0_o 
























 cobra's gunna cobra: cant argue with that..

another gem: we SHOULD make fun of drunk drivers. 




 the question is: what was it used for??

but really i think its fair to use a washcloth with soap to wash your body, i'm sure i know people who do that. I remember thats how we showered when we were kids, but i personally havent used a washcloth in years. straight up soap to skin all the way! 




 Lawlz. Of course. 




 YOU are a fat ...mmBITCH! 




 thats fair 




 shes gunna look super hot lying prone on the couch when her back is out tomorrow, amirite guys??  




 ...is it? i feel like things like winters are cold enough to freeze things... 

although actually i guess the cold beverage may only count as "nice" if you are drinking it while you are very hot, which maybe requires electricity, so since then, sure i could see that. 




 maybe im trying to overthink this but... i dont get it? whos taking off the top? man or woman? does it matter? im definitely overthinking this; help a brother out people! 




 right? 

here's an idea; lets give drunk people tiny razor sharp objects and encourage them to throw them around the bar. 
great work, everyone!

its actually shocking and/or impressive  how rarely you hear about horrible dartgame blindings or maimings.. 

edit: words 
























 now, im not a bartender but isnt that, like.. its job?

still, definitely a r/perfectfit :) 




 mmmm tree blood... plus like, fruit is flower fetuses, no? or no wait, flower genitals? SOMEthing delicious. 




 no no you're missing the point; if we make fun of the drunk drivers maybe they WONT die in drunk driving accidents; it will help them change their ways! that or the younger generation will grow up really believing in how stupid it is, because they will get made fun of it they ever did it. we're not making fun of the families who have already suffered; we're not monsters! 




 okay yep thats a good call; but in that case i prefer the scrubby things instead of a washcloth, or an exfoliating face/body wash. i feel like a washcloth doesnt scrub hard enough somehow; so apparently for me its either no scrub just soap; or super scrub shiny face styles... i never thought about this before but its strange and true. 




 no, i wash my ass with face soap.

nah but really, the soap is clean; thats why its soap. as long as you rinse after using so theres no hairs or whatever. 




 this is a tough one: my heart says GO FOR IT but my head says make sure you know what you are doing before you go messing  around in that little kids life; he should be her and your priority when it comes to any kind of life decisions. dont go in and out of his life needlessly, it sounds like he has it rough enough as it is.

other than that it sounds like you could be good for her and it would be worth having this kind of conversation with her if she feels the same way. 




 i think this doesnt always work: i dont know if its because they dont update at the same rate but im pretty sure links ive already voted on my computer still appear on mobile unvoted. conversely, however, i think sometimes voted app links appear purple on the site. i might be wrong though, i wasnt paying attention until now.. 




 pretty sure comment karma is straight garbage; link karma or GTFO  




 (-_-) 
























 ohhhhhhhhhh SNAP 




 dude hates the band.. or maybe his entire life. 




 im confused, no vaping allowed, so people smoked instead? 

Seems... conspicuous. 




 The SuckCut: it SUCKS as it CUTS 




 talk about your first world problems... 




 this seems more creepy than funny... 




 bummer, dude. 




 okay wait, lets talk about this because i dont understand it either. what exactly do all the children mean, can someone explain? im super out of the loop on this one.. 




 okay sure, but drag a mop around once it awhile too, k?

edit: now im just imagining the bathroom at the beginning of Trainspotting and thinking there arent enough flushes in the world... 
























 i dont see anything wrong with this idea in principle, but i think it really depends strongly on what this guy wants/would want. If he WANTS a relationship but just doesnt want to take these steps, or doesnt have time or whatever, then it could be a really nice favour for him that he would appreciate. If not, he might not be too happy about it, right? Theres the risk of him feeling insulted or that you are overstepping your boundaries or soemthing like that.

i don tknow if this is something you'd want to ask him about first? like you can still take care of the whole thing for him just let him give you the okay first? OR if you definitely know that he would appreciate it without talking, then i dont see a problem with it and pleasantly surprising him with a few potential women who want to meet him. really, i think it all depends on this guys personal reaction to the idea. 




 i think a big difference between leaving a narcissist versus leaving a cancer victim is that a narcissist is generally capable to taking care of themselves ( even if they want you to believe they aren't); you are not leaving them to suffer and/or die, whereas by staying with them you are in fact suffering yourself. 

also, at a certain point (and i think this is true when you are trying to help anyone) you have to let your own self-preservation kick in. If something is causing more harm to you than help to them, sometimes you have to save yourself instead. You cant let someone drag you down and ruin your life simply out of guilt for leaving them. You wouldnt allow a drug addicted or abusive partner ruin your own happiness for the sake of theirs, ESPECIALLY (when it comes to narcissists) nothing you do seems to even make them happy. I feel the comparison is stronger between nFamily and abusive partners than between n's and those who are suffering from illness or injuries. 

There can always be some overlap; not every cancer patient has a heart of gold and sometimes sick people are abusive too, but in general i think the key difference is that you might hate caring for a cancer patient or invalid but you at least know you are helping them even if they dont appreciate it. but you are not helping or saving a narcissist by staying with them (and probably CANT help them anyway because its not that kind of illness i feel); you are only hurting yourself and letting them drag you down with them and ruining your own life for their sake. When you get to a point where you can realize that its either you or them, you have to choose you, because you are just as important as anyone else and deserve the chance to have a happy life just as much as anyone else.

 i totally understand feeling regret over things from the past, even if it doesnt seem completely reasonable or worthy of regret. i usually refer to it as getting stuck in my head; stuck in a vicious cycle of bad memories, and it OFTEN happens when im trying to go to sleep. but it can happen anywhere and i think there is a way to force yourself out of that cycle, using willpower, and distracting yourself, and also learning to be fully HONEST with yourself about accepting the things you cant change, and cutting yourself some slack. anxiety makes it easy for you to be honest about your negative aspects, its a skill tht you CAN aquire to learn to be honest about your positive aspects, and to learn to be kind to yourself. 

when im in bed having a panic attack over shit from highschool or family or whenever the hell long ago i like to just try to CLEAR MY MIND and focus on thinking NOTHING. sometimes by mentally repeating a word like "clearrrrrrr" (like a personal 'ommm") or a phrase like "just keep swimming" over and over (this one is good if im walking somewhere cuz its a rhythm) and if i notice myself thinking anything other than that i force myself to go back to my repetition; like meditating, and i will do this anywhere i need to; rushing to work, on the subway, in crowds etc. sometimes you just need something to stop the train of negativity in your head. again, its not something that is necesarily easy you need to practice it like a skill but it DOES get easier. and it works no matter what kind of anxiety im feeling; regret about the past, fear of the future, social situations, whatever. the meditation-style response has become very helpful for me.

i believe in you, its going to be ok 3 




 i think its normal and i think she will grow out of it to a certain degree, although sometimes they stay pretty chatty. i would just talk to her back; when my cat starts getting chatty i have a convo with him until he gets tired of it. Also, make sure she nots trying to tell you something: dirty litter, out of food or water, toy is stuck somewhere, could be anything you never know but my cat has definitely done things like that and tried to communicate about something specific.

beyond that in terms of advice; maybe earplugs? just try to be understanding and kind and not take out your frustrations even tho its annoying its not her fault she doesnt know shes being a brat! you could call her a brat though, thats fine :) 









 Awesome!  




 ok thats pretty funny. 




 oh my GOD it all makes so much sense now! thank you! and i see now that the "parent" comment was right there all along..

wow. just wow. 




 can and WILL

keep that in mind folks; no matter how hot you think you are now; wait 20 years and everyone looked ridiculous.

 I'm not sure what was happening here: someone in the comments said it was a black protest march. So the gun guys decided to make it an open carry march? I can see how that's a bit presumptive maybe but the gun dudes didn't seem to be bothering anyone; was is considered racist to bring guns to a black march? He seemed to be marching in support with the black people, just with guns.. So that's racist? I don't get it. I'm not even into guns or open carry laws etc but why did the gun dude seem like the most reasonable person there? I was confused by it. I was confused by the whole thing.  




 oh calamari thats another one i love! clams are pretty good too, and mussels and especially scallops! I'll add conch to the list of strange seafood i gotta try! 




 you are VERY welcome. i can relate to feeling guilty over just about anything; i dont know why but guilt has always been a huge part of my anxiety issues. its like, i KNOW im trying to do the right thing and be a good person but somehow it often FEELS like im just a douche, if that makes sense? one of the hardest things sometimes is taking care of yourself and being kind to yourself. i think because we worry we are just being selfish or narcissistic ourselves, but not wanting to take on someone elses issues because you know how much it will hurt you actually shows empathy, in my opinion, which is the opposite of narcissism. especially if they only want you to hurt anyway.

its like; if you can pull a drowning person out of the water, you can try to help them and give them mouth to mouth and bring them back to you. but if you cant pull them out, if they are fighting you and dont want your help, you have to recognize that before they drag you under with them. 

sorry that got a bit dramatic at the end there but i think its still relevant :/ i think knowing you are doing the right thing and dealing with your own guilt issues is a far more manageable task than dealing with other people abusing and shaming you because of THEIR issues. its not worth it, you do not deserve it, you are better than that and although it may not feel like it, there is NO SHAME in saving your own life (literally or metaphorically) if and when it comes to that.

 i can definitely appreciate that. i actually generally like those kinds of "niche" foods (another one thats a super overrated thing i really like is escargot with garlic butter) but now i dont know if ive ever tried cavier. i'm gunna have to do it sometime. 




 like, im not even saying cavier is gross, but talk about overrated; crazy expensive, tiny portions, status symbol (at least the "good stuff") fish eggs... its pretty weird if you think about it for too long.. 




 haters gonna hate, you just do you, bro. 




 learn to say the alphabet backwards: whenever people hear thats a sobriety test they are like WHAT i cant even do that sober! then you could be like oh yea? check THIS out ;) 




 Caviar - its JUST fish eggs people! 




 i have to go to work 2-4 days EVERY WEEK :(
