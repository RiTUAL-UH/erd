 WOW...I didn't know that Batman's costume looked that bad. He looks like a chode of some sort TBH 




 I'd give Alan Watts a chance. Check out a video on youtube. He's a modern philosopher like I've never seen before but then again I don't know many philosophers other than Socrates and his pupils 




 Not necessarily, if you eat more then you have to get rid of the waste products that you're body doesn't use and if you eat more then you are bound to have to poop more. So technically, a thinner person can poop more but on average the bigger person will expell more fecal matter. 




 No 




 Oreo is definitely one of the biggest cookie companies in the U.S. There are a ton more (We are capitalist after all) like Chips Ahoy, Mother's cookies, Famous Amous just to name a few. Oh and you probably already know that biscuits=cookies in the states. 




 I want to say no, but he might be that to you so idk 




 Okay??? Just because he had a vice, like us all, doesn't mean his philosophies are not valid.  




 Go listen to Alan Watts and his philosophy on life...Your Welcome.

 People will always go for easy karma. I for one, think people should boycott reddit gold. 




 If you say moral of the story is to not listen to a redditor's advice but you, a redditor, tell me not to....WTF 




 In PKA 132, Woody claimed to have a MMA fighter guest who fought a chimp lined up. Did he ever follow through getting this guest? I personally don't remember this ever being brought back up. 




 Ohhh. Yeah, she wasn't a very good guest. I remember her saying something like "People come to watch my streams for gameplay" and then I saw her twitter feed...And was like BULLSHIT https://twitter.com/MystikGunn/status/489593547062927361 




 Well, thats a pretty boring answer. Was she asked this before? 




 They've talked about this before but it was a guy who payed something like court fees or maybe a ticket in pennies. Don't know what episode sorry :( 




 I know, Lot of ways you could go with this  




 If I Only Had 24 Hours I Would... 




 Get off your fucking phone in the movie theaters! I don't give half a shit if you so much so desire to snapchat that you are watching Jurassic World, hoping on the inside that your friends are jealous that you are having fun.  




 Thank you so much for this post! 




 I guess you're Australian now mate :) 




 Just...Wow 









 I've put in a ton of work finding samples (mostly on youtube). I was just trying to get some new artists or songs that I might not have heard before! Thanks for the input! 




 Im 16 y/o, I make hiphop instrumentals and whatnot, I am running out of samples and I was wanting a challenge or even just some suggestions. I'd prefer ambient, chillwave, downtempo, soul, disco, or rnb samples, although any suggestion would be great!  




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tniZ20PbWRQ

Not sure why the link wasn't working in the text. SKIP TO 0:20  









 Not sure if you need a song? but I make beats and if you like it then let me know. https://soundcloud.com/sonnywane/demons 




 I am currently 16 but when I was 14 I was in a similar situation. Try FL Studio's free demo. I used that for a year. Save your projects and export them all you want! You just can't re-open saved projects after closing the program :( 




 Simple Kick on every fourth beat, a oldschool hat, and a clap. Not my genre per-say (  I'm 16) but its just a simple drum loop over a sample. I could re-create it in like 2 minutes. Sorry, but I don't know what exactly you are asking. 




 I'm not an expert, just a 16 y/o hiphop music producer, and I use samples a TON, but I think the situation varies on who you are sampling. If you can get into contact with the creator of the sample source, he/she can give you permission to use the sample for free or they might charge you/want a cut for the use of their artistry. If you're releasing this for monetary gains, usually the label would take care of sample clearance but I'm not sure if thats possibility in your situation or not. 




 What episode was it discussed? I consider myself a PKA Historian but I don't recall when this was discussed. Time stamp would be great, episode number would be good too! 









 I'm no PKA veteran but,my experience is that, Woody pronounces Liam Neeson correctly nearly everytime he attempts to on the show. 




 Can't wait to see how the Punisher is gonna be in Season 2! 





























 Woody's channel would then be the equivalent to the sahara desert. 




 Is it on Netflix? 




 I just wanted to know, cause the show needs a little more salt in its game. 




 I thought you were correcting my spelling, but it was correct and I just didn't know what you were trying to convey. Good day sir. 




 "They just cracked inter-dimensional travel" 




 ??? 




 This is a suggestion for the PKA crew to watch. Woody, in PKA 238, said he wanted to stream movies and I immediately thought of Black Mirror. WATCH EPISODE TWO, this is a tv show like 'The Twilight Zone' only it is a more modern, rated-r version. I would love you guys to give theories on what you think the second episode (the best episode) symbolizes because there is a lot a room for interpretation.

Edit: I think Kyle may have mentioned this show before on PKA. He may have already seen it so idk. 




 After the fiasco on PKA 238, where 98% of viewers were screaming map names at their computer screens. I have engineered a link of sorts that will resolve any future map name struggles. Your welcome. 

http://www.themodernwarfare2.com/mw2/multiplayer/maps/ 




 You know, it wouldn't be hard at all for woody to literally search 'MW2 Maps' on google.

 I wouldn't risk it bro.  




 Dude, worse could have happened, trust me. Just wait about a month and no one will ever remember that you said that. It really wasn't even a scumbag thing to say in the joking atmosphere. Don't worry about it. 




 Good ol' anvil jokes 




 I cosign with this suggestion. It really was great Netflix original, very dark. 




 You might be my long lost twin...Hello brother. 




 Gotta keep in mind that they are just friends that are having a conversation, not your AP U.S History teachers.

 Only problem is that these subs only have like 2,000 subscribers and max 25 people on at a given time :( 




 Thanks for posting this! 




 None of them allow you to post your own music. If they do please let me know where you post. I make Hip-Hop beats 




 It really is annoying :( 




 It seems like you get on sub-reddits like WeAreTheMusicMakers and I can't even show what I have created. Kind of frustrating to see every subreddit I encounter discourage self posting. Anyway, where can I post my music? Which sub-reddits?

Edit: I'm a Hip-Hop/Rap Music Producer 









 If you have 1 video and split it in to like 8 videos, but get a fourth of the views of the original on each of the 8 videos he'd still be making twice as much money.  









 I actually charge $25 for a basic lease. PM me if you're still interested! 




 Woody probably still going to do short clips, Gotta get that money. 




 Annnnnnd Fuck your Poll it is! Love those style of videos! 
























 OP /u/chimpaman, contrary to common belief when you use e.g. you are supposed to list things and i.e. is when you elaborate/restate what you just said. 




 All I have to say is that, a good story excutes on a few basic points. Character development, conflict, suspense, and the resolution. All this were either non-existent, half-assed or just plain unsatisfying. I just don't understand how so many people could like the movie. 




 Green place confused me, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that, if I remember correctly, where the water was being kept...just above that...there was grass and whatnot and that's where the main female character ended up in the end when they were going up the 'elevator' contraption. Also, WHY do they want to go to the greenland in the first place, didn't get that either. 




 No man, They did him right in my opinion. Granted, I never read comic books at all so I don't know exactly the in's and out's of Kingpin's character but I get the essence of him. And I feel like they took a comic character and made him a REAL human being. Also, the reason he was a 'numbskull' was that he truly fell in love and it changed him. I think we will definitely get a more darker Kingpin in the future of the show though which would be cool to see. 




 Thanks for respecting my opinion :) 




 Where do I begin. I hated the orange filter over the film, Tom Hardy doesn't even talk, they didn't really introduce the setting or environment for those who have never seen a mad max film before (like me), the conflict at hand was sort of confusing, they drive for about an hour in one direction only to drive back, their were probably more explosions than words spoken and dare I say that the transformer movies that people shit on had more of a story and coolness factor than this movie, they want to see the green place or whatever the fuck but you see the grass on top of the pillars in the beginning of the movie, this movie could have been over in 13 minutes had they seen the grass on the top of the pillars, OHHH and if the mass majority lived without water and power why the fuck don't they revolt, how did the world become the sahara desert, what is the world like on other continents, and lastly the story was absolutely non-existent which kind of pisses me off and I am not hard to please when it comes to movies, but this is one of the few movies that I've ever truly hated and it disgusts me that people drool over it and honestly demand more movies like it.

TL;DR: Mad Max is garbage. Don't get sucked into the hype. 




 Marketing. Get as many people to know about the game. Advertising early gives you more time. 




 It depends...If you run in the direction of the earth spin you would stay in the same place in space (therefore it would take 24 hours). However, if you run the in the opposite direction of the earth spinning then you would actually take only 12 hours. 




 Love to experience 'The Dark Knight' in the theaters for the first time. 




 Funnel Cake. Only get them when I go to the beach. Only twice in my life. 




 The Holy Grail 




 Read the 'Death in the Family' comic book. That's probably what had happened years before the Man of Steel encounter. 




 This didn't change me or my life, but it was a great read. Check out 'The Most Dangerous Game'. Really short intense story. 




 'The Stranger' introduced me to existentialism 




 1984 definitely 




 The graphics kind of suck TBH 




 I remember when I was younger I once had a dream of Darth Maul chasing me around my house...Those Star Wars prequels really messed me up man.

 I just imagine Kyle in a batman costume porking that one chick, and him just asking her "Do you bleed" as he 'dislodges' her diaphram with his huge manhood. 




 Not gonna downvote you, no one should. You have your opinion. I'm not trying to make a choice between the hosts and Wings (or say that one side is bad) but I just really miss the old fun spontaneous times ya know. I just watch alot of old PKA's out of nostalgia and it kinda sucks that Wings, arguably the life of the show, is gone. WE WILL NEVER SEE THE OLD CAST TOGETHER EVER, which really upsets me. Anyways, Murka and Kyle are great. I'll keep watching until those two are gone. 




 [Tum hi Ho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umqb9KENgmk) is definitely one of my favorites. Love song in which you feel the story. Music is the universal language. 




 Did you take this picture with a toaster? 




 Thanks for the link! 




 I would love to see a Green Arrow film. That'd be really good, the TV show is one of my favorite things out right now. 




 I don't know how you could do a proper green lantern film. Just like they can't do a Hulk film correctly for the life of them. 
























 I'm looking for quality FREE Vst's. I make Hip-Hop music. Any VST/Filter/Compressor you feel a producer should have please leave in the comments below and a link to where we can get them would be great (not necessary)!

Edit: I use FL Studio.

Edit: Thank you to all who have posted! You guys help me find tons of new things to play with! Some more mastering tools would also be great, I forgot to mention that in the text   title when I wrote it! 




 Thank you BROOOO :) 




 Not very hard at all to get into it. Check out busyworksbeats on youtube for things you really need help on. I was in a similar position to you when I was 14 and I started making beats on FL with no knowledge of chords or scales. All I really suggest is buying proper studio monitors. For hiphop production THAT IS ALL THE HARDWARE YOU NEED. Get some good VST's and demos and your set. I've been making beats for about a year and a half and [these](https://soundcloud.com/sonnywane/my-chain/s-unAqy) are the types of things I'm doing now.

 I love Murkah, but he's no Wings. Wouldn't you agree the show would be even better if it were Woody, Wings, Kyle, and Murkah. That's the All-Star lineup, doesn't get any better than that.

 The hosts don't care about our input. Just keep watching old PKA's and...never forgive, never forget. 




 I don't know why it didn't link in the title. I pasted the link in the box. Link is now in the text above. 




 These are PKA stats, but I have sources that have confirmed 80% of PKA viewers fell victim to the ruse. 




 You have a good point 




 The Babadook 




 I hate games of thrones talk. I don't watch the show, but I thought you guys who do watch would enjoy this article I found. (I have nothing against the show, and I don't agree that it is a 'satanic' tv show)

LINK TO THE ARTICLE: [Here] (http://christnews.org/en/game-of-thrones-7-raisons-de-boycotter-cette-serie-aux-messages-satanistes/) 




 If it wasn't a Doctor Who mug would you have reacted the same way? He wan't flaunting it, he was just casually drinking whatever he was drinking. 




 What urks me the most though is that the hosts pretended to like him during the show for 50+ shows, but they talk badly about him now openly. Kind of makes me realize that I'm watching a SHOW and not a couple friends who are having interesting conversations. 




 Thanks for the parody of my post, but Lefty was god-awful and I was commenting my hate for him the second episode he was brought back as a permanent host. I mean did you listen to him and his fake laughs and the pseudo-intellectual rants he would get lost on. Huge blemish of the show. 




 oooooorrrr maybe he was just thirsty.

 How did they get these shots of his home? Was he in on this? 




 It wasn't a good film. (I watched a bunch of reviews on youtube) 




 Are you an idiot? 




 I watched with both my parents and only because EVERY review I watched mislead me into thinking the movie was the best action movie of the decade. 




 I've never walked out of a movie, but I would have had I come to the movies alone. Come to find out the people I went with also wanted to leave during the movie.

 Hello, recently my Chrome is being affected by a virus of sorts that always appears when i search something on google, it brings up suggestions that says 'Ads by SuperAdRemoval' as you can see on the photo.

Any help would be appreciated, thanks.

 No, whenever he brings up the topic about companies with names without meaning, he always mentions Seananners, Pepsi, and Cisco. If you're a PKA Historian then you heard him talk about this topic like 5-6 times already. He doesn't know that Cisco stems from that.

 Well...you can burn trees, but you can't burn steel beams. So the question we should really be asking is, Can steel beams live forever? 




 A lost dog strays into a jungle. A lion sees this from a distance and says with caution "this guy looks edible, never seen his kind before". So the lion starts rushing towards the dog with menace. The dog notices and starts to panic but as he's about to run he sees some bones next to him and gets an idea and says loudly "mmm...that was some good lion meat!". The lion abruptly stops and says " woah! This guy seems tougher then he looks, I better leave while I can". Over by the tree top, a monkey witnessed everything. Evidently, the monkey realizes the he can benefit from this situation by telling the lion and getting something in return. So the monkey proceeds to tell the lion what really happened and the lion says angrily "get on my back, we'll get him together". So they start rushing back to the dog. The dog sees them and realized what happened and starts to panic even more. He then gets another idea and shouts "where the hell is that monkey! I told him to bring me another lion an hour ago... 




 When did he say that? smells like BS to me. 




 They are long gone friend...Prank calls, hilarious untold stories, and Wings of Redemption. Those are all done. 




 No bad at all. Could be mastered a bit better and randomizing the velocity of the hi-hats would give a less robotic sound to something more human. 




 Where do I download? 




 So I can just add it like I do all my other vst's to FL. No alternative method to add it? 




 Murkah is my favorite host/guest. But where I think many might get confused with my comment is that Wings brought a certain type of spontaneous entertainment and hilaritiy. And, yes most of the time we would laugh at him but that was what cause most of the best moments on the show ever. Seriously go watch some 'Funniest moments of PKA' videos on youtube 90% the funny spawned from Wings. I love Murkah but he's more intellectual and calculated with his sarcastic remarks. Murkah is my favorite host/guest of every single person whose been on PKA but no one truly can replace or replicate what wings did for the show.

 What is he talking about??? Margot Robbie is FINEEEEE 




 Yea, you lost me when you mentioned the Star Wars prequels. I really hope 'The Force Awakens' furthers the plot with some more fun senate meetings! 




 I liked them too, but since the fanboy-dom died down in me since my viewing I can objectively look back and say they weren't up to par with some of their good movies. Ant-Man was good though. Just go into it like its a fun heist movie and you'll be pleased.

 Did the same thing except I said "Attention Walmart shoppers. All items will be 90% percent off for the next 10 minutes. Thank you." And I watched the store turn from a place where civilians buy goods to a trackmeet of sorts in which people rushed through every isle half-jogging, grabbing what they could and sprinting to the cash register as the workers looked at each other in complete confusion. Some middle-aged man had watched me walk up, and me not wearing the typical walmart get-up...ya know the blue shirt with the khakis, and when I had finished my 'announcement' he looked me dead in the eyes while shaking his head and said "Some people just want to watch the world burn."
