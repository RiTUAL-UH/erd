 Hahahahaha your doom awaits you, John.

 That's actually a human corpse dead center  




 *meanwhile the caller robs you blind of every earthly possession you own* 




 I'm in love  




 Dude has a massive receding hairline. Maybe he thinks you work for Bosley 




 What the actual fuck 




 That's a beautiful song, honey. 




 Imagine her in bed. That's mad luxurious. 




 he looks weird. Like he has a spray tan and tons of botox. Seriously get a group of guy friends and confront him like you gotta a fucking problem?! And go from there. If he still keeps up I'd take it to the cops or take matters into my own hands. My two cents.
 









 Lemme guess he's Daryll for Halloween  




 reddit* 




 I'd hit it  




 I work with an organization called doctors without diplomas... 




 Legit as Fuck OP. Good shit. 




 Lol you're all like this is what my life is...coming up with Masters level thesis' on fictional stories on nosleep  




 Billy. Tasted. Divine. 




 Let's go have a drink with Alan Good time I bet he has some good stories to tell  




 what exactly do you do for a living? Damn I wish I had that kind of time  




 Frosted flakes nigga damn 




 I've never understood how people randomly get possessed by a demon. Did she summon it? Involved in the occult? If not, why did it chose her if it is a demon? Oujii board? Fuck idk  




 Hah I knew that would be the outcome before I read one line of this. Guess only people with cats could understand they're some weird little shits. Still love mine though. 




 Bet she had a great bush 




 I hope that was more than one bottle  




 Especially playing Goldeneye 




 Ok I can tell you for a fact you're either 1. Dead 2. Insane 3. In another dimension

A mass government evacuation isn't plausible without you hearing a whisper or seeing any signs of it. Awesome truck too btw  




 Shhhhh he can see you everywhere  




 The Cheshire Cat from Alice visited Willy Wonka 




 It's a portal straight to hell 




 Go steal an Xbox one and we''ll talk it out over some Destiny  




 Someone else said it but I'm just glad he's dead. Think about the sleepless nights you would've had if he got away...wear his shoes as a trophy  




 Loved you in BB! How was it working on the set of arguably one of the best shows to grace the screen?! And what can we look forward to on Better Call Saul? Any good cameos? More Huell? 




 Sounds like you're confused on your sexuality and are having some violent wet dreams! 




 Who should you be more afraid of? The govt or the aliens? 




 I'm extremely curious to try this..I have had trouble remembering parts of my childhood I wonder if this would reveal anything.. 




 Fuck you man! Nothing better than stuffed crust cheese Digiorno with Frank's and ranch...I put that shit on everything! 




 You're a beautiful snowflake. 




 C-L-A-I-R-E...I...W-A-N-T Y-O-U-R P-U-S-S-Y 




 You wouldn't believe what kinds of things I saw in people's bags. 




 Ok right before I left a "supervisor" got into a fight with another airport employee and cut him with a box cutter. I was working that day but didn't witness it, I was on break. 

http://m.wsbtv.com/news/news/tsa-agent-arrested-allegedly-cutting-worker-box-cu/ngCSF/

Employees were stealing passengers credit cards out of their checked bags and using them to buy things online. FBI got involved and conducted a sting operation. Yeah, bad time for all involved. 

Employees would routinely cuss out upper management..I'm talking management coma parable to RVPs/AVPs.


Employees got caught trying to transport cocaine through a secured area and onto planes. 


You get it I think...
 




 You're telling me! I fucking would die reading those. It was like the ideas and thought process of a 3rd grader. And everyone would belittle each other it was hilarious. Even the top rated ideas hardly ever got implemented.  




 Exactly. Look at what privatizing the prison system did.  




 They need to implement a fitness standard and arm competent individuals.  Like CBP.  




 *rolls over and see lady from Send Me To Hell* 




 I recently left TSA for a much better job. Have college degree and consider myself intelligent. They actually pay decent...I made $16 an hr. However, they have literally NO hiring standards besides a high school diploma. I remember talking to one of my supervisors who was actually competent and did interviews and he told me that in one of his interviews a guy told him his relevant experience was being a "hall monitor in middle school." No shit. Of course the supervisor politely told him he wasn't a good fit but management gave him shit for it and I think hired the guy anyway. Also, EVERYONE within is not satisfied. The level of incompetence extends to upper management. I have so many stories of things like this happening. They need to completely revamp this organization from the top down. Things like this will never stop. The good ole boys club was the method of promotion at the airport I worked as well. You would have guys making over 100k a year with no military/law enforcement experience trying to manage the biggest/busiest airport in the world. Sorry for being scatterbrained but /rant. 




 You can get a shotgun for $200 




 Just make sure you follow the code, Dex. 




 Haha 3  




 Contorting in all those positions seems to be a great workout! I bet you have a killer body, OP! 




 Ok so after hearing shit like that I would've never went back to sleep. My Mossberg would've taken the place of your crowbar. Not a happy ending for that guy  




 Call PETA/ASPCA 




 If he wasn't mentally ill, I would've gladly kicked his ass if I was you. Jk even if he was mentally ill too ;) 




 If you're a true Christian, and have accepted Jesus into your heart, then demons/evil spirits can't touch you i thought? Unless you're inviting them in via Ouija board..keep us updated OP I've been curious as to situations such as this.  




 What the actual fuck...looks like some real life Hills Have Eyes cousin-fucker bullshit. And donating dog food for admission? Da fuq  




 False imprisonment is what that would be called. Add on some assault and battery charges. Mayne Malicious Mischief, disorderly conduct, really whatever the fuck the cops wanted to charge them with. 




 Haha okay Dexter.. 




 From the sound of it, I'm sure you can handle yourself, OP. Raquel's friend sounds like a nerd. Well written as well, OP.  




 Saw this on Drugs Inc episode a while back. Makes you trip balls to the point of having a spiritual/enlightenment experience. Guy runs a camp that is devoted solely to therapy down in Chile? Can't remember country exactly  




 Kids *see* the darndest things! 




 This...

http://youtu.be/G7RgN9ijwE4 




 Such beauty and mystery all in one picture.  




 That sounds like a horrible daily routine. No idea what that could be.  




 Fuck that. I can take ghost stories any day but anything with the occult/pentagrams/Satan scares the shit out of me. Id have to be heavily intoxicated/armed to go in that bitch. 




 Actually I stay on no sleep and whatever's on the front page. I'm sure it's good though I was only thinking via writing. Hah. I read one about that wasn't my husband I slept with last night and that took half the day at work lolol winning
 




 As opposed to the Xbox One which is 8 




 I'm sure this is decent but reading 12 updates to catch up?! Meh.. 




 Waiting outside a movie theater? That's low. Bitch I hope the fuck he do! He's be a dead son of a bitch I can tell ya that 




 Not as creepy as I expected but still weird. I think seeing him the first time driving by scared me more  




 Buried alive but left you with a cell phone?  




 Plot twist or annoying double post? You decide.. 




 My point exactly... 




 One of the first believable stories on no sleep 




 But who exactly wrote "help" is the real question. #plottwist #redherring 




 Thanks for sharing and sorry for all you've been through. Try to pick up the pieces and find meaning in your life. Positivity and good vibes for you my friend. 




 Go back go back go back! I bet you won't! 




 *yawns* 




 That is so bizarre I've never read of a spirit causing hair loss. I think it's definitely a good idea to get a priest/pastor involved. Your wife is probably confused and doesn't know that she's dead or hasn't come to grips with it. Get Michelle blessed and seek medical attention. And tell her to stay far away. Good luck look forward to the next update. 




 Weirdest post I've read on reddit thus far. Da fuq..all my experiences with acid never teleported me through time and space.  




 Whatever is inhabiting your brothers body is probably a lot smarter and stronger than you, seeing as he knocked you down without even realizing it. 'It' is probably already doing the same, plotting how to kill you or stage your death. Be careful! 




 Gotta love dogs :) 




 Dammit, Casper! 




 Ryan started the fire! 




 Why does your hand insist on being so violent?  




 Damn. Kid or not I would've absolutely destroyed that kid. Guarantee you he gets out at 18. The CJ system is ass-backwards. Sorry, OP. :( 




 True. She admits to psychological issues as well which probably played a huge part in it. Anyway, hope you get the help you need OP and figure out what's going on! Best wishes. 




 Morphine induces auditory and visual hallucinations in some cases. I've seen it first hand. My grandpa was in the hospital and on a Morphine drip...he was pretty comical. He saw monkeys in the ceiling and other obviously medically induced hallucinations. No worries. 




 Sewing set? Do you drink cranberry juice while you sew as well? Pussy 




 These are awesome! 




 Ok the fact that you admitted to previous psychiatric care makes this story void. Sounds like paranoid delusions and/or hallucinations. It seems extremely unlikely that someone would go to that great a length to stalk a call center manager.  Also, I feel like this is a plot from a movie..., 




 So a couple nights ago I experienced what I think was sleep paralysis for the first time in my life (I'm 26). It was the most terrifying yet interesting experience I've had in my entire life. Basically, I went to sleep that night and woke up in the middle but I was paralyzed. I had an overwhelming fear take over my whole body as if someone or something was in the room with me. I read up on it and basically my mind was awake but my body was still "asleep". It gives me the chills thinking back on it. It lasted maybe ten seconds then I was woke up woke up and was able to move and function normally. Anyone else experienced this? Idk what could have triggered it as I have no family history of this and as I said I've never experienced it in 26 years. So random to happen now.  
























 Bobo the clown went hard as fuck last night!

 "The floor is lava! That's the lava game, when you pretend that the floor is lava and you climb up on all the furniture. I see some of you don't get that. I don't care, that's okay. You might have called it something else, but it meant the same thing; you were poor. I'd tell my mom, "I want a Nintendo." and she'd reply "The floor is lava!" "What's wrong with our house? Why can't we afford better carpeting? It's called two jobs, bitch!" That's how I used to talk. I was very street" -Daniel Tosh  




 Can you imagine dropping and watching this video in its entirety?

It could have been $3,000 but we wanted the money up front

 You're "special" brother Daniel ;) 




 Hey Brother Daniel, you're a big p*ssy boy!  




 Guy just kept cleaning and didn't even care that the guy drove off lol like you Think any normal person would be like "hey sir I'm back here!"  




 I wonder how painful it would be to get that filled in with ink. Think about the stories you could tell...
"Cool tat bro where'd you get that idea?..

"Oh that's where I got struck by lightning back in '99"

 Ah Fuck me in the goat ass 




 he says "sex time!". I said fine but only if he took off his knife hands

This had me fucking dying. 




 I've got the weirdest boner right now  




 Not a terrible movie, actually pretty comical at times. Not purposefully, either. 




 Who's the blonde? 









 Dex! Which season did you enjoy filming most? Least? 

In my opinion season 4 was the best. 

...now bring me one of those donuts! 




 Your girlfriend pulled a fast one on ya with the most elaborate setup yet. She "faked" sick   clued in one of her friends to your little game. She even planned it to the extent of when it would be storming and also pretended to be asleep. All the while snickering behind the door while you look for her and talk to yourself.  




 Is this a depiction of Noah and the Ark? 




 Cocaine is a helluva drug! 




 Exactly what the Fuck is this supposed to be? Dude cannot drive for shit either  




 Yeah I'm sure this one is similar to the brick above in regards to the screams. The officer truly was pleading for his life. And screaming after being shot multiple times. The sounds he makes in his final breaths are disturbing too, don't watch it. 




 Great parenting right here! World needs more selfless men and women like this. Well in this case girl :)  




 Slice of Life 




 That'd be perfect because if I raged I could just throw all my shit right in the river  




 He's all like "sup, bro?...don't mind me." 




 Love how the one chick responds with "why thank you!" Haha no shame  














 Yeah it's so sad. Such a storied franchise tarnished by such incompetence. It pisses me off more that they haven't come out with any statement since. Just tell us what's going on. Quit saying thanks for your continued patience. Nobody's been patient. You got the benefit of the doubt but two weeks later and nothings fixed.  




 Wait so someone escaped the cradle? Through your floor and out your door?!? Please update, OP! And a gun is useless unloaded btw  














 Wear pooka shell necklaces and Abercrombie clothes. And frosted tips. Nobody does that anymore unless you're Guy Fieri

 This seems safe. Good thing the guy has some rhythm. 




 Damn that's rough. How did she survive by drinking her own blood? 




 Hi Nick! Its me your secretive Santa. Well I think you know who I am by now. I saw you staring out the window and figured you saw me this morning! Oh well but have you received your gift?! I'm sure you'll love it! Haven't seen you much lately so figured you've been busy at work. 




 At first glance at the pic I thought it was a snowman with a dick and balls _ 




 After sex you would basically just push me off of you or get up and leave the room or something

Holy shit this had me dying  




 I can't tie my shoes but I can fuck your bitch! 




 I'll come across the pond love and take you to a nice steak dinner  




 He's about to swallow Mr Hoot owl in two bites  




 I've got a gsp/lab mix. She's super sweet and intelligent but really high strung. She can be very destructive if you don't give her exercise and attention. Luckily my wife rescued a kitten and they've been bff's for a couple months now. My cat just trolls on her 




 Or maybe OP is really hot with a killer bod and he wants to fuck the taboo 




 LATER BITCHHHhhhh 




 Curb stomp that motherfucker! Then your dog can eat it's remains :) 




 This is relevant but me and my wife saw "Into the Woods" last night. I was blown away by the sexual undertones and general themes for a 'kids movie'. There's a scene in the woods with Emily Blunt and Chris Pine where they hardcore makeout (when Blunts married with a newborn child) and carry on for 5 minutes with song about how it doesn't matter what happens since they're in the woods. 

There was death and disfigurement throughout as well. Maybe its just me but it did seem a bit much for a children's movie. Just my two cents. 




 The black one comes over and has a cute pair of slippers on like oh hai I'm here tew 




 Because all I can think of is that dumbass State Farm commercial with the talking baby and the mine  




 The souls of a thousand corpses. 




 Its Toucan Sam's used condom. 




 What a fucking idiot that "cop" is. He had no reasonable suspicion to search her for drugs in a fucking divorce hearing. And the other fat fuck can fuck off too for being the one to arrest her. False allegations against a police officer? Stupid fuck doesn't even know what laws he's supposed to enforce. And finally a big fuck you to the judge. Hope you're barred from ever practicing law again. 




 It's the necrophilia sex doll! 




 
My friend Shannon told me that he had discovered a super easy way to make money.

I thought it was a guy the whole time. 

Also, out of curiosity, how much money you make Rhonda? 




 Why didn't he just kill you right there?

Rhonda please don't scream you know I can't take the screams  




 iiiiii caught ya! Youuuuu can't run from me!

 Just watched it on Xbox video. Definitely some laugh out loud parts. Franco made this movie, imo.  




 I bet it took at least 15 minutes to do that  




 The movie guy seeing if he was liking his movie! 









 Do you think criminals read shit like that?!

These are the kind of people that should spend the rest of their life rotting in a cell. Stop giving long sentences and incarcerating non-violent offenders for petty crimes. 




 Babe! It looks great!  




 [Reminds me of this scene](http://youtu.be/aEMQDIzZzFw) 




 Wow the fuq 




 That's fucked up but I'm still smiling. Gotta love reddit. 




 Sussana Reid can beat me off anytime  




 Back when halo 2 was in its prime my friend made it a point to create the most vulgar gamertags he could. Xbox Live kept letting him change it for free and never actually banned him. I think one was CumOnMySweetAss and then he changed it to xFxIxNxGxExRxMxEx. Good times.

 So tell me more about Vega? Are bald eagles as badass handling as they look? I've seen one from a distance because they migrated south where I live and they are fuckin huge  




 You mentioned birds make bad pets. Why is this? Because they can fly or just because they're assholes in general? 

PS fuck yeah Vega! Fuck yeah America!

 I think this is the only instrument they used (and needed) in both insidious movies. 




 No idea how the threat got all the way out the door. With that many cops the threat should have been eliminated immediately. Getting in a firefight in a doorway is bad news. They got the job done though and kudos for no one else being killed (hostages).

 Proud American here. 

I've followed this story since the beginning and I have felt so connected. So connected to your pain. To the newspapers pain. The families. The victims. France. 

It's a great travesty that not only France suffered but the entire world. It was no doubt an attack on free speech. 

Our Secretary of State, John Kerry, said it best: "every American stands behind you." And I truly feel that way. Feel for everyone involved.

I hope these mother fuckers are found and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I hope they rot in prison for the rest of their pathetic lives.


Much love from USA

 This all comes down to the golden rule. He treated them like he would want to be treated and potentially was saved from serious injury or death. 









 Does he put mayonnaise in toasters? 




 Any birth defects in your family? 




 Umadbro 




 Now I'm hungry  




 Speaking of context I think you've taken this way out of context. It was funny because she made up a ridiculously long word trying to sound intelligent. Guess I need to specify for all you keyboard, altruistic warriors.  





























 No Mr Duck walked in on the bird having a rager. "You betta nod yo' head in my cage you plastic fuck!"

*beat drops* 




 Haha he's a masochist  




 Third Eye Blind? 














 Or maybe none were reported to the police? 









 Why am I oddly disappointed? 




 Hmmm idk. Depends on how hard the trip is. I've had acid trips that I wanted to end they were so intense. 12 hours is a long time to trip can't imagine 36 holy fuck 




 They donate a small amount to actual research and CEO takes a huge salary I think around 700k/yr 




 I think they all decided to try rowing for the first time that day and this is the result. 














 Hah that's a leopard seal. He's just thinking of how tasty your leg would be  




 They're everywhere (soft whispers) 




 Fuck me lol  




 Apparently its a harbor seal. Leopard Seals are somewhat of apex predators and their only known predators are Killer Whales...sometimes. Plus leopard seals are fucking huge usually 1,000+ lbs and over 10 feet in length..

 If I had the money me and my wife would move to Australia now :( 




 If there's a discrepancy in the order do they respond via fax as well? 


































 Wow you look ravishing today  




 Hey babe wanna let me wrangle you tonight? 




 Yeah because you see melted cars everyday lol dumb bitch  














 Proof? 




 Haha thanks for clarifying it at the end  




 I sense some sarcasm here.. 




 Interesting that women are more sexually aroused at the idea of rape then men. Kinda scary also. 

Edit: as a fellow redditor pointed out, I guess a better adjective to describe this conundrum would be confusing. Women are more sexually aroused by "rape" however it's more of the characteristics of a legitimate rape that they like. Being dominated, forceful, etc.  




 Poison dart frog? Put some poison on an arrow and shoot it at someone does that count? 




 I love how it says "patent pending" like someone might actually infringe upon it  









 I'm a liability adjuster for a large insurance company and I deal with disputes like this every day. That's why we get as much evidence as we can from both sides. In this case, if I received this video I would just deny liability (if she was a claimant and OP was our policyholder). At best, she could deny liability as well and her insurance company could pursue arbitration. However, once the arbiter receives video evidence that clearly puts her at fault, her insurance company would just write it off as a loss. You can't really charge her with anything because she legitimately may think she wasn't at fault. Criminal charges and investigation by the state attorney General generally occur if she was claiming an accident happened at 'x' time without a police report or any witnesses or evidence to support her claim.

Edit: Also, liability and determining who is at fault in an auto accident is more of a civil issue. Therefore nothing could really be filed against her. 




 Now I def know you were dreaming ;) 









 If she's a 6.5 in the office wouldn't she be higher out? I guess depending on the companies dress code  




 Fuck you guy  




 And the ice cream? 




 Parkour* at its finest  




 Doin' parkour bruh 














 He is  




 I guess it's possible...just figured it was shitty quality  



















 http://i.imgur.com/y09qLMR.gif 




 Wait so is this part of the reason why he does such dumb shit? 



















 Haha the sign for the yard it was located in has a website: autobeyours.com

The sign also said "hybrid cars and parts". Fuck they weren't lying.  




 They just wanted the fuel efficiency of a Prius with the reliability of a Subaru.  














 That is so surreal like holy fuck I can only imagine the taxi driver shit himself  














 You mean her titties are? 




 What exactly is going on here? 




 Exactly what I was thinking. He had to be tall because he doesn't look big at all.  




 http://i.imgur.com/y09qLMR.gif 




 Top of the morning to ya  




 Holy fucking shit do not look at those screens on acid  









 Yeah it'll do that to you..best binge-worthy show  




 Haha exactly what I was thinking. Saul Goodman to the rescue! 


But seriously can't wait for the new show...apparently getting good reviews so far... 




 It seems like animals with disabilities like this are always the most affectionate, loving creatures. My wife and I were at a shelter once and a German Sheperd was missing one front leg as the result of a car accident. It was the sweetest dog I think I've ever come across. Brings a tear to my eye thinking of that sweet girl...hope she found a good home and is living healthy and free. 




 What about the one where someone posted a map of the coordinates of a well where a girls remains allegedly were? I think this was a couple months ago...anyone know if anything ever came of that? 




 Funny you posted this I literally just watched this again like two nights ago. When Claire meets Dr. Lecter for the first time and he's just standing there in his cell..all awkwardly just staring waiting on her haha 




 One time, back in my high school days, I rage quit so hard I unplugged my Xbox and went outside and threw it as high and far as I could down my parents driveway. At the time, it was so gratifying seeing it shatter into pieces. I've since learned the value of money...RIP Xbox 360   damn you Halo 2 tryhards :( 




 Just don't die  




 What a dumb bitch..so sorry you had to deal with that scum kitty :)

 Saw an episode on TLC about extreme cheapskates. One family used washcloths as toilet paper and would just wash and re-use them. Stopped watching after that episode. 




 Because of NATO agreements and also in case something did happen on that side of the world the US needs a way to respond quickly.

MELINDA BROWN DAWKINS BABY! 




 ELI5: Is it just me or does not providing any support for terrorism in the last six months seem like a short time? And the "I swear we won't do it in the future either!" Seem sort of trivial? Or is it one of those things that you're not on the list until you prove otherwise? 




 Rip Marlins  




 How mad bro  




 These fucking inbreds think that because of recent events regarding police brutality that every single interaction is now a social injustice and against the law. The ignorance is strong with this one.

 She has the right to be an attorney  




 I wish his two cunt sisters got bodyslammed and he caught it on camera

 Animals truly are a gift from God. Seeing stuff like this really crushes your soul when you can imagine how people could be cruel to such innocent creatures. 




 Instead they get to hide behind the facade of a business  and don't get charged with anything. The business just gets a slap on the wrist.

 Best course of action would have been to walk your property with a weapon. Showing anyone who is potentially hiding you are armed and not afraid to use it. Worked in my case at least. Nobody fucked with my house anymore.
