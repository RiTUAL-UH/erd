 I have the Hogwarts crest, Always, and the dark mark  




 I have tattoos. Like three so far. And more on the way. That's how I rep the wizarding world!!!  




 Maybe post a link to it? I can't find it.... 




 Why is r/Hogwarts private?  




 I was just wondering if there was a sub reddit for Hogwarts.  




 In the audiobooks, it's pronounced Voldemore. In the paper books and movies, it's Voldemort. Someone help?  




 Not true, they die in the reverse order.  




 I actually started at 24mgs because that's the amount a real cigarette has. It's actually better than the patch in my opinion because you still have the hand to mouth, which is what did me in so many times. The hand to mouth habit is the true killer in smoking, and vaping really helps with that. The patch won't satisfy that feeling, so you're more likely to go back to smoking.  




 One nice thing about vaping is that you can progress down!! I'm currently on zero nicotine, but I like the flavour I use. So I continue to do it anyways.  




 So I don't know how to post how long it's been for me, but it's been over a year now. The e cigarette is a joke. I tried one for a while, and I fucking hated it. What you want to do is go to the nearest vape shop. Look it up, google can tell you where it is. Go in and tell them your story. They will help you out. I have a regular shop I go to, and they are some of the nicest, most supportive people I've met (besides my girlfriend of course.) 

Keep it up!! You can do it!! 
























 I'm willing to bet JKR realised that her faithful fandom would bring this point up, though. Hence the reason that Harry became a horcrux.  




 I feel as though the Room of Requirement was a perfect place. In plain sight, however, for close to 50 years he was the only one who knew what it looked like. Incredibly smart in my opinion.  




 He used the blood of a foe (that for being Harry Potter, his 7th and final Horcrux) 




 Bacon, coffee, clean hair, and beer 




 In my opinion, reboots are inevitable. It's gonna happen. My only hope is that the reboots do these movies justice. Otherwise, I don't wanna live on this planet anymore.  




 I'm with you. Never read a single comic. But I love the movies. Like no other.  




 You and I not only have something in common, then, but would also be excellent friends.  




 Cloak and wand. 

The only people I know who have passed, are at peace. I don't want to disturb their peace. They are waiting for me on the other side of the Veil. 

The cloak and wand, they just seem like the logical choices.  




 Ah yes. Some of those plot lines were missing. However, I still believe it was the best. The final movie haas too many disappointments for me.  




 What issue did you have with the third movie? I thought it was the best done of the series.  
























 I don't think I ever noticed that!! You, dear potter head, are awesome!!!  




 And I would be honoured to be among those numbers alongside good brothers and sisters  




 Oh yes. It's real to us.  




 So I'm rereading the fourth book for the 400th time. And I'm at the graveyard with Harry. And I noticed something. One of the trees mentioned is a yew tree. And voldemorts' wand is made of yew. Thought it was an interesting little tidbit!!  




 Welcome home, friend!! 




 I like this idea. This one seems like the most likely to me.  




 Is anyone else curious as to how a howler doesn't explode en route? Like, what kind of magic is used for that? What if a howler had to be sent to somewhere like Bulgaria from England? Just thought of this!!  




 Not all the trials are present before getting to the sorcerers stone.  




 And this is what I was trying to point out :) thank you.  




 Think about it. JKR says that the process for making a Horcrux is difficult and time consuming. If we hold this to truth, then how was Harry "accidental"? Voldie would've had to have had this planned out, correct? Share your thoughts!! 
























 I'm 21, and I've rather recently discovered that I have early onset arthritis in my right knee. So I definitely know your struggle. It's not easy. I usually just use either a compression brace, or a full on DonJoy knee brace, depending on the pain level. However, there are many days I can go without one. But on bad days, I can't really seem to cope with it. I get really irritable, and my closest friends and family can't really seem to be near me. The only one who has been able to stay by me is the wonderful woman I'm dating. She always seems to know what to say or do. My biggest recommendation is to find a good brace, and an even better support system. Because otherwise, at least in my opinion, the pain may just over take you. 

Also, lots of ibuprofen. Always a big help when it comes to inflammation, or any sort of pain. Hope this helped you!! You are not alone!!  




 ......Can someone please tell me what video this is? I've actually never heard of it..... 




 That's not pathetic at all. It's never easy to lose someone you're close with, and when something like this happens, it's completely natural to want to make amends. Don't think that it's pathetic that you want to talk to your grandfather again, and tell him how you feel. 




 As far as the Miranda Rights being read is concerned, they only need to read them to you before booking you. So they have from the time they arrest you to the time they book you to read them to you. Otherwise, anything that you have said before that won't count against you. 

After you've been read them, then the only thing you should say is "I want to speak to a lawyer."  




 First off, congratulations on being clean!! My father ended up kicking meth, so it's always amazing for me to hear of others that are also doing well!! I love hearing about how others can kick those kinds of habits to better themselves!! 

Second, it sounds like your parents don't really deserve your time. (Now that is just my opinion, but I've also had to cut toxic people from my life, so I know the struggle.) It sucks to write/hear, but sometimes that's what's necessary to building a happy and healthy life.

I'm honestly curious, you said the help of NA, and I know that one. Who is the "Bill W" mentioned in this post? 




 This. This is the reason Ron would never join Voldy. He's way more afraid Mrs. Weasley than of the Dark Lord.  




 That makes total sense. Her character feels to forced. And (at least, this is how it feels to me) she is always going on about how she's a lesbian. It almost feels as though the writers just want people to know that, rather than focus on making her a hunter. That's just my two cents though. 




 I never really thought of Charlie in that sense. In fact, I never really think of any of the characters in that sense unless it's a situation like when Sam or Dean has a female guest over. Other than that, to me, they are all just people who hunt the things that go bump in the night. So I guess I'm saying that I personally have never had a problem with Charlie, however, I can definitely see where you would have a problem with her. And kudos to you for pointing this out :) 




 Everyone keeps saying Tony. For some reason, I just can't see it being him. I can, of course, see it being Fury. I, too, feel it needs to be him.  




 That's the best thing about this fandom. Everyone helps everyone else.  
























 My 10 is probably about a 7-7.5 for most of you. For others, it would probably be considered higher, and for the rest, it could even be a 3. Pain tolerance is dependent on the person, and I know for me, a 10 is when I can't walk (Early-Onset Arthritis.) My knee is in so much pain, I have to judge just how badly I need to use the restroom before getting out of bed just to walk across the hall. My SO has on more than one occasion had to go to the kitchen for me just to get me some water because I'm at a 6 for me. A 6 cripples me, a 10 just means that I can't move at all, for fear of passing out. 

Unfortunately for me, if I'm having a day when I reach a 10 and still need to go to work, I have to push through due to the fact that my job requires I be on my feet all day. Those are the worst days for me, because no one at my office knows that I have arthritis in my knee.  




 If there's a chance the treatment won't work, I think you should try the surgery. No one likes to be in pain all the time, and I for one would do anything I could to help the recovery process. I'm willing to put down good money that your insurance would cover this kind of surgery. I say go for it, OP!! 




 So that "foreign" language looks and sounds Enochian to me. That would be the language of the Angels for anyone who didn't already know. Those are very dangerous spells, OP. Be careful dealing with those. 




 Yeah, I pressed it. Couldn't stop myself. AMA!! 




 I currently have a Turtleship Brass, but it's getting old, been dropped one too many times, and it's just overall time for a new mod. However, I'm broke as all hell. Can someone suggest a good mod that's fairly inexpensive? I'd like to spend $150 or less if possible. Thanks guys!! 




 I honestly can't read the books or listen to the audiobooks without feeling like this. This universe is just expansive and including that I always feel as though I'm a part of it, and it's so well written that I just get sucked in and have a really difficult time leaving. That being said, NO REGRETS!!!! 




 All demonic entities have a dark side. That's why they are considered demons. That being said, not all are pure evil. In fact, some try to do good, and bad things happen as a result. Some try to help, and things just go awry. Try to focus yourself on what he wants, OP, and remember this. Maybe he's trying to help. Maybe he's trying to rectify his sins of past. 

Always acknowledge him when he wants it. It's when they get angry that the bad shit really goes down. That's when they strike that hardest, and the strongest. 

They are always there watching, waiting for the right moment.  




 Can you ask this "site" why the shadow people only went for those with souls? I feel as though those without souls (such as yourself and myself) would be of more use. We could cause destruction, mayhem, and chaos.  




 I also work at Starbucks, and I must say, being burned by coffee is usually the least of my worries in a day. I usually burn myself a good three or four times a day. My hands and wrists are so used to it, I just don't feel it anymore xD 

ANYWAYS!!!! I digress. Honestly, I feel for you :/ It's really shitty when you burn yourself at work. Did you supervisor at least let you go to the back to take care of it? 




 Simmons. The chick that plays her is fine, and the accent, oh god the accent...... 
























 Can anyone tell me where these woods are? I want to do some research on the Whistlers. To me, it seems as though they are just people that are driven to this primal place in order to survive these woods, and then are drawn into a war they had no idea was taking place with this creature out there. This creature is the true problem, the reason that people may die. However, if the Whistlers can get to the people first, then the people would be safe.  




 Keep us updated as to whether or not it's Tommy!! And stay safe, OP. Seriously, the supernatural is not something you want after you. Ever.  




 I just won't tell anyone about her :D Then she can't kill me, can she? 




 So I'm curious, and a little lost, OP. What does cracking your knuckles do?  




 First, I want to thank everyone here for your support :) you're a great group of people, and I'm glad I have this sub. 

Second, this isn't a work related injury. It's just pain brought on by my arthritis. I appreciate everyone's concern, but this isn't the first time this has happened. I'll get through it, I was just hoping someone would have some advice on pain management :/ 




 So some background first. I work in an office as a facilities assistant. That basically means I'm the Break Room Fairy. I stock up the break rooms in the morning, check/set up the conference rooms, deliver mail, that sort of thing. This typically means I'm on my feet all day. As someone with early onset arthritis in one of my knees, this can become quite painful. 

However, today was different. I was delivering some packages, and went to turn around on my heel, a motion I have made thousands of times around here. The only difference? I somehow twisted wrong, and my knee explodes into an instant ten on the pain scale. I couldn't move, nor could I call out. My coworkers don't know I have these knee problems, and letting them know would be bad, as it's only my fifth week on this job. After a few minutes, the pain subsided to an easy seven, but has remained there since. This happened about an hour ago, and every time I go to turn, instant ten again. I just don't know what to do, I'm hoping someone can help? Maybe a couple of pointers, other than not turning on that leg? As I work in an office, it's incredibly difficult to not move and turn this way and that....

Sorry for the long post!! 




 I haven't started season ten yet!! Don't tell me anything!! I tried to start it on Hulu, but Hulu is really dumb and only streams the 5 most recent episodes. So I haven't started it yet. 




 Do you know what House she belongs to? Because that could be a very big gift op there. 




 Are you Sirius with that? That was a very Harry joke. 




 Honestly, I want them to go back to the roots of the show. Start bringing in new monsters like the first season. Or even repeat a few monsters we've seen before. We've seen a few episodes with Shapeshifters, and Vamps of course. But only one werewolf, one woman in white, one Wendigo, etc. However, over 100 demon episodes, plenty with angels, and the like. Honestly, I want some new damn material.  
























 A) I'm pretty sure it's a continuation, and B) why was it removed? It was a good story. 




 I just went to my GP 




 .......The fuck? 




 I don't have the books in front of me right now, so I could be remembering wrong, but isn't it stated somewhere that McGonagall told all the teachers about Hermione's time turner? If so, Lupin could've seen both, and just realised what was really happening.  




 I just want to know, why did the turtle have to die? 




 He sounds like a good man. Music is one of the most important things to hold onto. I wish you the best.  




 I'm sorry for your loss. What was your father like?  




 I would see myself living with my girlfriend, having become my wife, pregnant with our child. We live somewhere far away from here, whether it's Portland (we've both expressed great interest in living there) or abroad. Only seeing our somewhat messed up families on the big holidays. Surrounded by friends close enough to consider them family. 

Money and status mean incredibly close to nothing to me. Those things buy comfort, not happiness. So the house we live in would be big enough to support the family, but it wouldn't be overly extravagant.  




 So i actually figured it out.... but i know someone on here would've greed, for which i am grateful..... 




 So i have no idea how to create a post on my reddit to go app.... i made this post on chrome, btw... can someone please tell me how to create a post on my app?
