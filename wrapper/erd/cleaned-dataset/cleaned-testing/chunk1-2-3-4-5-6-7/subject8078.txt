 I went from having ZERO ads on anything to ads appearing on Facebook, Twitter, OKCupid, reddit etc.  I personally haven't changed anything or any settings.  

I am able to use the "Block element" function to get rid of the sidebar ads, but the in-line ads in Twitter (Promoted by....) and Facebook (Suggested Post) still appear.  

Was there a new update that removed preferences?  Should I just switch to Ad Block or something else?

I am using the most up-to-date Google Chrome (Version 32.0.1700.107).

I am using the following extensions:

* Adblock Plus
* BugMeNot Lite
* Disconnect
* Ghostery
* Google Cast
* Google Chrome to Phone Extension
* Google Dictionary (By Google)
* Google Docs
* HTTPS Everywhere
* Imagus
* imgur Extension by Metronomik
* Jeffrey's Exif viewer
* Reddit Enhancement Suite
* Save to Google Drive
* Search by Image (by Google)
* SmartVideo For YouTube
* Stealthy
* TinEye Reverse Image Search

This is my first post in this subreddit, so please let me know if you need anything else!  

**EDIT:** I removed ABP and a few other extensions.  Then installed AdBlock.  Now everything looks normal again!  

I also updated a setting in Ghostery.  In the Options, under Advance, "Block new elements by default" was unchecked.  So I believe that allowed new trackers to sneak in.  Hopefully that won't occur anymore.  

Thanks for everyones help!

 Long time lurker, first time poster.

I searched around MFA and google first, but I need some additional help.

First off, I currently have a self-tie adjustable bow tie with thistle ends.  

I originally adjusted the tie to match my neck (like with my shirts), but I wasn't able to get a good knot.  When I folded the tie over, to form the knot, a thicker part crossed over.  So I increased it by 1.5 inches.  Is that fine? As long as I have enough fabric for a good knot? 

When I start out, I've seen a lot of places say you need to lower the left end 1.5 inches.  I usually match the right end with the concave dip in the left end.  Is that fine?

For a normal necktie, I know how to make it look good.  Good looking knot, with dimple, etc.  But what are some things to do to make sure my bow tie is a step above?  Should I have a dimple on both sides of the knot?  Should those dimples be symmetric?  

How about the back part of the ends?  There are the "front" ends, that everyone sees, then the back ends, which are behind the front ends.  Should/can they show?  Or is it like the skinny part of a necktie?  The bow tie I have has two different patterns on each side, so it wouldn't camouflage in.  I think it looks fine if a little bit of the back end is showing, but I don't want to commit a faux pas.

I'm going to a wedding with this, so I want to make sure everything is on point.  

One tip I've figured out is once you pass the tie through the loop and you're in the home stretch.  Then lightly tug on the single end on each side.  Then do the same thing with the double end on each side.  Eventually it will make the knot tighter and create the dimples.  

My apologies if I misused some terminology or whatnot.   






























































































 Assuming I don't have the original on my computer, I would need to pull it off of facebook. 




 The NCAA first had a University Division and College Division. The University Division became Division I and the College Division became Division II and III, in 1973.

In 1978 Division 1 divided into Division 1A (Football Bowl Subdivision) and IAA (Football Championship Subdivision).  

So each break made the club more exclusive.

Now we have the AQ conferences that at one time was 66 of the 120 schools in FBS (I haven't counted all of the new schools).

So are we going to a point where we will have an NCAA FBS "AQ" National Champ and NCAA FBS "non-AQ" National Champ, along with the FCS champs?

Let's face it, no team outside of the current AQs or the merged conference are ever going to win consistently.  

Or am I just talking out of my ass? 







































 The Farm and The Point are two covert CIA training facility. 

The Farm, [Camp Peary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Peary), is located near Williamsburg, Virginia.  This seems to be the main CIA training facility.

The Point, [Harvey Point](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Point), is located in Hertford, North Carolina.  It conducts counter-terrorism courses that involve high explosives and ballistics.

So what are other grey/black places in the United States that aren't on the official maps. 




 The subreddits I'm subscribed to on reddit.com aren't on reddit is fun. My subreddits used to be on RIF.  What happened? 




 I have a few (if any) links that are all seven days old. Vast majority have around 20-30 points, none over 75.  I have my "links from:" option set to today.  WTF gives? Anyone else having issues? 





























 So lets say we have medication X that comes in two forms, instant and extended release.  For my question, lets say both are prescribed as 20mg.  I know the instant gives you the full 20mg dose of medicine X.  And I know the extended release has a part of it (usually half) in an extra coating to prolong the time for you to feel the effects.  

So the instant release has 20mg of active product, my question is how much does the extended release have of the active ingredient?  Would it be 10mg instantly, then 10mg in the coat?  Or 20mg instant and 20mg in the coat?  Or something else? 
 



















 For some reason I am still rocky with Redox reactions.  Every time I feel I get right to the cusp of getting it, something throws me off my game.  I know **OIL RIG** and **LEO GER**, and I have watched Khan (besides reading my chem books).  So is there anyway to look at a (pair) of molecules and know if they're reduced or oxidized?

To the second question.  I've been messing with [Glutathione](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) (GSH) and its partner [Glutathione disulfide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione_disulfide) (GSSG).  So GSH is also referred to as L-Glutathione reduced and GSSG is also referred to as L-Glutathione oxidized.  So is having the Hydrogen always equal reduced?  And not having the hydrogen equal oxidized?  

So in other words HR (**H**ydrogen, **R**educed) and NoHO (**No** **H**ydrogen, **O**xidized)

Also going off that we have [NADPH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_phosphate) which is the reduced form of NADPH.  So NADPH, with the H, is reduced and NADP, without the H, is oxidized.  

Looking on wikipedia, they have another memory aid: "**LEORA** says **GEROA**"  Loss of Electrons is Oxidation (Reducing Agent) and Gain of Electrons is Reduced (Oxidizing Agent).

So with my GSH/GSSG example, GSH is the oxidizing agent (because it is reduced) and GSSG is the reducing agent (because it is oxidized).  

I apologize for the length of this, but I am at the point where I would be embarrassed to ask anyone (even though it is better to be embarrassed then not to know it).

Plus if anyone has any tips regarding this, I would love to see them! 
























 And today was the first day I took my prescription of Adderall (10mg).  What are some things I should look for or know etc?  The only thing I felt today was a warm feeling for a little while.

I read about the abuse (they have to give a pamphlet on it).  I am not worried about that.  

So any hints, tricks, or whatever I should know or look out for? 






















































 Obviously, Arrested Development was a beyond awesome show.  This show isn't on that level, but it is probably the best 30mins on TV currently.  

All "normal people" watch The Office (which sucks and is old now), and somewhat 30 Rock (which is awesome as well).  No one I know watch Community.  

God I hope the C word doesn't happen to them........ 




 It was simple animation/cartoon.  I remember a black background.  I looked on wikipedia for the name, but didn't see anything that stood out.  I can't recall though if this was the WHOLE show, or part of it.  I just remember it was a bunch of chemistry stuff on a VERY basic level.  Like I was around 5.   




 Come on Ira Glass, get off your ass and make some more free shows for me

 Facebook gave you the option to change your url to something you know.  So it now takes this form http://www.facebook.com/qwerty (whatever you chose it to be)

When you sign into facebook, type "qwerty", instead of your full email address.

It should allow you to sign in a little quicker.   




 I keep up with a few websites, but I have to randomly check on them to see if new information is posted.  They don't use RSS or anything like that.  Is there a program that could do that? AND if so, is there one that is free? 









 I used to use my mouse for everything, but after learning keyboard shortcuts, I've completely use the keyboard, outside of things where the mouse is faster.  I've actually developed a snobbery towards "mouse only user".  It is quite sad.

Some of the shortcuts I use:

Crtl C - Copu
Crtl V - Paste
Crtl X - Cut
Crtl T - new tab
Crtl W - Close opened tab
pgup - page up
pgdn - page down
Crtl Shift N - private browser
Atl Tab - Rotate between open windows
Crtl Tab - Rotate between tabs

I'm sure there are other ones I use, but don't recall the shortcut keys. 














 Isn't natural born via normal vaginal birth?  Has this ever been discussed?  





























 It is another cop show.  It started on NBC, but "moved" to TNT.  I really enjoy it and it seems "realer" than others.  I'm not a cop, but it is put together well.  The grittiness of it reminds me of The Wire.  I am afraid it is going to get dropped though..... 
































































 Sure there are some shitty programs on Discovery Health, but where will I be able to watch Dr. G: Medical Examiner, Medical Incredible, Mystery Diagnosis, Trauma: Life In The E.R. etc?  I don't care about anything Oprah does.

 [Edward Digges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Digges) served as one of the Colonial Governor of Virginia.  

On his [tombstone](http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr GRid=32117881) it states, among other things:
 "...He had issue **6 sons and 7 daughters** by the body of Elizabeth his wife who of her conjugal affection hath dedicated to him this Memorial."

The [Will](http://books.google.com/books?id=f8kWVOafFtQC lpg=PA170 pg=PA174#v=onepage q f=false) of Edward Digges only mentions "four boys and four girls"

In the book **[The Spirit in the South](http://books.google.com/books?id=QLETmBQzY8YC lpg=PA335 ots=mLJY-d6xnC dq=%22Catherine%20digges%22%20%22edward%20digges%22%20jamestown pg=PA335#v=onepage q f=false)**, it gives a lot of circumstantial evidence that Catherine is indeed the daughter of Edward.  

[Catherine](http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr GRid=68821007) married William Herndon in 1677.  William supported Nathaniel Bacon, and his [rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon's_Rebellion), which could have given cause for Edward to disown Catherine.  

According to this [post](http://genforum.genealogy.com/cgi-bin/pageload.cgi?doubts::herndon::457.html), the New England Historical and Genealogical Society doubts Catherine is the daughter of Edward.  But I can't find the actual document.  

Is there anything out there that could give more evidence towards lineage or not?

 I almost had this happen to me.  I had some random very specific question about Word, and couldn't find anything online.  So I called my university's IT support and asked them.  They had no idea, but gave me a number to Microsoft Office tech.  Called that number, everything seemed fine at first.  He remotely logged into my computer via Logmein. But "bells" started going off and he said I had a virus on my computer etc etc, but he could fix it.  At that point, I realized it wasn't Microsoft and I let some random person into my computer.

I shut down that conversation and ran a bunch of scans. I also spoke to the "higher level" IT people at my university and they ran stuff as well.  It sounded like a Scare scam to them.

They seemed to have gotten an old Microsoft phone number, but websites still has MS as the listed business.

Learned me a big lesson.

 Counterpoint: Ted Stevens who was a United States Senator from Alaska, whose tenure extended from December 24, 1968, until January 3, 2009.  

He is the internet is "not a big truck," but a "series of tubes" that could be clogged with information.

Stevens also confused the terms Internet and e-mail. 

He was also the Chairmen of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, which oversees internet regulation.

 Florida will pay Idaho full $975,000 to Idaho   schools agree to play at UF in 2017 




 Confimed by AP tweet: https://twitter.com/AP/status/507257950868885504 









 There is a big chance none of these schools will be good in 5 years, whereas P5 schools will at the very least still have a lot of fans who will travel. 

Look who is talking, Ole Miss.  Y'all seem to be no more than two years removed from a .500 season.  

And JUST because a team is P5 doesn't mean they have fans.  Try to get Wake Forest, Boston College, Illinois etc. fans to their own stadium, much less an opponents.  

What I am saying is dividing current P5/G5 teams as of now is lazy way to do it.  There are too many teams that should switch places.

 I thought I read somewhere where people were creating fake FB accounts, so Tinder didn't pair up with FB.  But they didn't get any swipes, it just idled.  But maybe not.  




 They're evolving?!  Shiiittt 




 AFAIK the only 'thing' you need to get Tinder is Facebook with 50+ friends.  

So I assume they outsource to Asia/Eastern Europe some 12 year old to create a bunch of fake accounts, making them friends in the process (to get over the 50 friend threshold).  Then I am sure they is a way to spoof their location, then let the bots do their 'dirty work'.

 This is what I did.  Make a new Facebook photo album   set the privacy to only you.  Then upload pics there.  Then you can use those pics on Tinder.

But now you have those pics on the facebook server, and at mercy of any "random" privacy changes that might occur.  




 Southern Comfort bombed in sprite

Think a jager bomb, in how to make it.  




 you guys still gave up 41 points

Might wanna look at the play-by-play, before making a general statement like that.  

Their first TD came from a trick play. They did a Wide receiver pass to get the points. That occurred with 9:51 left in the FIRST  http://www.tarheeltimes.com/article59839.aspx

Second TD came on a 4th down   5 trick play.  Their punter threw a pass for a TD.  That was 14:47 in the Second. 

They got two more TDs in the 4th quarter.  But it was already 56-27 at the start.

So they got 14pts off of trick plays and 14pts in garbage 4Q time.  Yes they count as much as legit TDs, but the defense only gave up 13 other points.   




 Yup, on Android.  














 Hope so! Or A LOT of kids are missing around me.  




 Currently, the match list is sorted by your most recent matches/messages.  It would be good to have the option to resort by distance.  

If I go to City B for a weekend, then come back to City A, I don't want City B matches clogging up my match list.  On the flip side, when I travel back to City B, it would be nice to see who I previously matched with.   




 The new Tinder match sound reminds me of an "Emergency Alert" I receive for Amber alerts and what not.  My heart always skips a beat when that thing screeches.   




 One idea is reverted back to the previous **Notification** settings.  Now, you can either have notifications or not.

In previous versions, you could choose between an icon, sound or both.

I don't want to broadcast my Tindering to my friends, so I have to keep my phone on silent. 




 Could we have a thread on realistic improvements to the Tinder app?  I say realistic, because asking for an "undo swipe" button won't fly.  But there has to be ways to make this app better.  

Hopefully someone on their development team is subscribed to this subreddit.

Today was the first time the block list has appeared.  But no, they didn't (or I didn't see them) on the first page.  




 Here is my full screenshotted list: https://imgur.com/a/VlzoX

I'll refresh my /r/all list now.  It was interesting beforehand.  None of them showed up immediately.  It was a couple of pages in before they would appear.   









 Only one had an "r/" in front of it.  And it wasn't a filtered subreddit that I saw.

I have a filer list that I haven't messed with in a long while.  But today, after redditing on All/Top, I had a Trees then Atheism post pop through (Both on my filter list).  Now many others on my list are showing up.

I've restarted Chome, but the same thing occurs. 

Thanks! 




 The blue from the flag bleeds over to the Coat of Arms.  But I think it does look better than the clip art.  




 I guess mine is magical.

But the reason for the post is to give an option on buying a suit (or nice clothes in general) that might be a little too large.  But save money, because it is on sale.  

You shouldn't go buy something more than 1 or 2 sizes too large.  Anything larger and your tailor might not be able to help.  And the price to tailor might reach the breakpoint price.  And even then, you can take it too the tailor and let them look at it.  If they can't help you, return the clothes.   




 It is a little (lot) more complex, especially at the FBS level. But that is a good birds eye view of things.  




 This might get confusing.

Dayton is in the Football Championship Subdivision.  Division I (your top level) is subdivided into two subdivisions: Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and Football Championship Subdivision (FCS).  

FBS has your more well known teams. 

So Dayton plays at the 2nd highest level of collegiate football.  




 Whenever it looks like I struck gold, it usually ends up being Fools Gold.  




 Arrrgh! 




 Exactly.  I watched like a quarter of the MNF game last night, before I came out of my brainfart and realized it was on WatchESPN.com.   




 The key for a good looking suit, is to get a tailor to do his magic on it.

They can also tailor suits that wouldn't fit otherwise.

Let me give you an example.

I recently bought a Brooks Brothers suit for 70% off.  It ended up being around $90 total.  But it was a couple of sizes too large for me.  So I brought it to my local tailor. $80 later, I had a suit that fits/looks good.  The only reason it was $80, was because it was A LOT bigger than what I needed.  I took another suit that was closer to my size and only spent $50. 

So I paid $90+$80 for a $300 suit.  

This is ESPECIALLY good for the normal sized people out there.  It always seems like the clearance rack is full of plus sized clothes.  

--------

They also have repaired numerous things (backpacks etc), cheaply as well.  

It never hurts to buy something and take it by the Tailor and see what they can do.  At worse, you'll have to return the item.   




 Do people not borrow login info from family/friends for WatchESPN.com?  




 What would it look like if they converted the white background to transparent?  

What about someone *improve* their flag?   














  punishes the P5 schools

I thought G5 is guaranteed a spot. As in that wouldn't punish them.  

Wait....This isn't about getting into the 4-team playoffs.  No G5 team will get that, almost ever.  This is about one of the NYD bowl games. 




 If Marshall wins out, they CAN'T get the New Year's bowl, unless every other possible team stumbles.

Why?

Because if an undefeated Marshall gets in with their SOS, then every team will start to schedule down. 

The committee HAS to set a standard in regards to SOS.

 Also, the American Athletic Conference isn't listed, and Big East is.  That needs to change.  Along with that CUSA has a lot of new members as well.  




 Are you the owner of this website?  If so, I have a few suggestions. 

* If you choose a certain division, repopulate the conference list with conferences on in that division.

* Have the ability to make each conference a different color, so people can compare schools/conferences.

* Have the ability to choose multiple divisions/conferences to display at once.

 You don't know the "reddit story" about Colby? 














 A lot of the MAC would do better in FCS, I believe.  




 Logical candidates to replace UAB in C-USA: 

Liberty, James Madison, Georgia State, South Alabama, Texas State, Arkansas State, ULL 




 Yeah, maybe more along the lines of FCS or lower division.

But take Eastern Michigan.  They have average attendance around 4,000 for the past 3 years.

The past 4 years, Ball State has averaged around 9-15k.

Akron 9-17k.

The NCAA REALLLY needs to bring back the 15k butts-in-seats average over 2 years.  Four teams didn't cross 15k in 2013.  Another SIX averaged 15-16k. 

It just feels like a bubble that is about to pop. 




 There are plenty of FBS teams that should disband football. But UAB isn't one of them.

 When was this particular scene in relation to when we know at that time?   




 Thats pretty awesome!  It would be cool if there was a site that had all the FBS stadiums broken down like that (when possible).  But that would be A LOT of work, for such little payoff.  




 It would be neat if someone color coded each section on when it was built.  So we could see which area was the original - more recent renovation.  



















 I just used this to see when the comet landing will occur, at 14:00 GMT. Typing in "14:00 GMT" converts to local time 




 I don't understand why there aren't any commercials.  Especially if it can help spread some of the cost around.  









 What is *"neat"* about this is to look at the total votes, compared to the congressional districts won.

In **2010**: Democrats had 45.2% of the vote, Republican had 54.1%.

Democrats won 7 seats, Republicans won 6.

**2010 Redistricting**

In **2012**: Democrats had 50.60% of the vote, Republican had 48.75%.

Democrats won 4 seats, Republicans won 9.

In **2014**: Democrats won 3 seats, Republicans won 10. I don't have the percentages for this race yet.

So before the redistricting, both parties reflected the overall direction of the state.  Post-redistricting, and gerrymandering has taken over.

https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/550054063358738432

**EDIT:**  For people talking about being a repeat offender:

The repeat offender policy was modified in 2014 in terms of what a player had to do to have a clean slate. After a first violation of a safety-related rule, a player must go 32 straight games without another such violation to have a clean slate. Includes reg. season, postseason and 2 preseason games. 

Suh's last such violation was in Week 1 of 2013, when he was fined for a low block. So he went the rest of last season, 2 preseason games, and 15 reg. season games.  That's 32 straight. So by letter of the law, he had a clean slate. 

Merton Hanks thought stepping on Rodgers was bad enough that even as a first offense should be suspension. Appeals officer Ted Cottrell saw it differently.
