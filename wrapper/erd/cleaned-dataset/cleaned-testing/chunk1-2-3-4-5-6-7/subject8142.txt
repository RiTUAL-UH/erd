 That's why I'd want to be a longsnapper. 




 And of course the flattery of calling her a 7. 




 I've had 3 or 4 professors show that in management classes. 




 In fairness, I'm not sure Weis would still be here even if he'd gotten continued #1 classes. Now assuming Weis still gets fired, we might have won 1 or 2. 




 Dollar drink night? 




 I won $400 in amazon gift cards for winning a GameFAQs contest. 




 [I found two guys for her.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPy1D-bsFDE) 




 This guy is way more excited than he should be for a lot of things. Learn a new description. Almost as much as he says artsy fartsy. 




 Plus there's the prospect of not going to the compass bowl this year. 




 Reminds me of Paul Finch from American Pie. 




 Nothing sets the mood like fucking in a cemetery. 




 Sergio Brown. Was surprised to see him get to the NFL at all, and now he's played 3 years and doesn't seem to be going away. He was bad on a terrible defense while he was here. Couldn't tackle at all. Or cover anyone. 




 I read yepp in the voice of Dave Hester from storage wars. 




 I like that he felt he needed to have hahas all the way to the 140 character limit. 




 Doesn't everyone play for the national championship game for at least the first week? You're at least playing for it until you lose. 




 You've clearly never been to youtube. 




 Aside from all the incredibly uncomfortable adjectives, the names should really be reversed so they line up with whose name it is. Unless it's a girl named Ross and a boy named Hannah. 




 At our campus gym over the summer, a lot of local high school football players would come in. A few of them would come in and sit at the bicep machine for 30 minutes, doing one of the lowest weights you could do, and then leave. Gotta get big. 




 People get excited to go to Alabama for the academics? 




 I have a friend who always makes the same face in pictures when he's drunk. We made an album of all 100 or so pictures he's done it in. 




 It's like when someone selling cars goes into the back to talk to their manager. Trying to negotiate and telling you what an opportunity you'd be missing. 




 It was my first question when he said he was a professional gambler. 




 It's called bargaining. 




 I like to imagine this is a form letter where you can circle which ones you'd like him to be. 




 When all else fails, compare the girl you're trying to impress to a man. 




 hi every1 im new!!!!!!! *holds up spork* my name is katy but u can call me t3h PeNgU1N oF d00m!!!!!!!! lol...as u can see im very random!!!! thats why i came here, 2 meetrandom ppl like me ^_^... im 13 years old (im mature 4 my age tho!!) i like 2 watch invader zim w/ my girlfreind (im bi if u dont like it deal w/it) its our favorite tv show!!! bcuz its SOOOO random!!!! shes random 2 of course but i want 2 meet more random ppl =) like they say the more the merrier!!!! lol...neways i hope 2 make alot of freinds here so give me lots of commentses!!!!DOOOOOMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! --- me bein random again ^_^ hehe...toodles!!!!!

*~t3h PeNgU1N oF d00m~* 




 Obviously you want one of those two options. 




 There's always a few kickers or punters every once in a while that played rugby or soccer. That's usually about it. 




 Hell we had 4 years in a row in the 80s where a QB from ND named Joe was starting in the Super Bowl. 




 Ringo's the Beatle of choice? 




 Yeah definitely the Stanford game. Even the rain just made it so much more exciting. Was just a ridiculous game. Granted my memories of it are pretty hazy, though. Gameday was fun as hell, too. And since we'd already beaten Michigan earlier, it was the last team I needed us to beat to not go 0-4 against anyone while I was here. 




 When I was in 1st grade I wanted to be a paleontologist but my teacher couldn't spell it so when we drew pictures of what we wanted to be I had to be an astronaut. 




 Time to take his talents to South Beach. 




 The amount of people I see wearing shit like jeans and sweaters and polos is ridiculous. And not even just lifting which is bad enough, but doing cardio like the stationary bike and elliptical. That's gotta be either really uncomfortable, or you're not working out hard enough to do anything. 




 Easily my favorite part. 




 Somebody took introductory psych and polisci. 




 The ESPN commercial wasn't lying! They really do say Roll Tide randomly and in awkward situations! 




 There's also the fact that you only graduate about half your players. And it's even worse if you're black. If you're just trying to go somewhere with good academics, why not go somewhere that's going to make sure you graduate? Schools like Notre Dame, Northwestern, Stanford, Rice and Duke all graduate over 85% of players. Hell Notre Dame actually graduates a higher percentage of black players than white. 




 And part of the only brother sister anchor team in America! Or something like that. 




 He didn't get fired but somebody posted a picture of his dress code at Epic. I showed it to a friend of mine who works there and she told me he'd get in trouble for it. A week later she texted me saying the guy got called out at a staff meeting or something. 




 Wow at that 2007 class of QBs. That's one hell of a deep class. 




 And then Bruce Almighty for whatever reason decided to do a real number for the theatrical release.  




 At least they won. 




 Those are Michigan fans complaining. We're the ones that dropped the series. And we dropped it to play games with the ACC. 




 Maybe I'm missing something, but what does Sandlot have to do with Notre Dame? Or did you just digress into sports movies from 1993 you don't like? 




 A guy in my dorm freshman year was named James Crowe. Never went by Jim. 




 I lived across the street with a family whose son was named Gehrig. Their other son was Nolan. Middle name Ryan. 




 1, 2, and 4. I went there, my dad went there, and I lived in South Bend until I was 14. 




 Shocker: sports stories get romanticized over the years! 




 Who gets excited for tax day? Unless you're an accountant who's excited to get a little bit of a break. 









 I have a friend who until she was 20 didn't realize you could have sex during the day. Someone made a joke about daytime sex or something and she looks at us all wide eyed and asks "Really?" Apparently she'd somehow managed to skip sex ed when she switched schools in high school. This was coupled with the fact that we can't have anyone of the opposite sex in our dorms between midnight and 9 on weeknights and 2 and 9 on weekends. She assumed it was to stop people from fucking, which is also technically against our rules. That defines sheltered. 




 Hell I go to Notre Dame and even all our science professors believe in evolution. 




 USC: Their weather. Right now at least. 




 Personally I think one should be the N, M, and Iowa division, and the other one can just be the other division. 




 If they changed their mascot to that it would make me so happy. 




 I've got a few.

My freshman roommate tried to give the head nod to Jimmy Clausen. Clausen shook his head at him.

Was in a seminar with our punter, Ben Turk. On several occasions the professor just called him punter. His text message noise was also "Where the white women at?" from Blazing saddles.

Used to play basketball with some of the football players at the gym. As the biggest guy in our group who played some center in middle school, I always got stuck guarding the linemen. The worst was Kapron Lewis-Moore. Dude had over 100 pounds and about 3 inches in height on me. I've never had to box out harder in my life.

My favorite story is of a friend of mine though. She's from Spain, so she doesn't really follow football, even as a Notre Dame student. But she was in a fairly small major, and Eric Olsen, our center, was also in that major. She was leaving class with him one day when they run into one of Olsen's friends. He tells her it's his friend Mike. She asks if he's on the football team, and he says yes. Then she asks what position he plays. Dude just looks at Olsen and asks if she's for real. Olsen has to apologize and say she's from Spain. Mike was Michael Floyd. 




 I was pretty convinced it would be him. Doubtful now though. Maybe in his honor we can have a blank cover. 




 Ironic because all of Holy Cross in Rudy is from Notre Dame. 




 Different girl, not Alex either. 




 And everyone know Frankie's is the best BBQ in town anyway. 




 I know a guy named James Crowe. He doesn't go by Jim. 




 The chem one is false, but the others are true.  




 He was dating someone before, too. Different girl. 




 I think it's hilarious. I've been waiting for something to come out because I knew he wasn't actually dating her. He was dating someone else at the time. He even just called her a friend early on I believe. This probably led to less shock when it all came out. Though I'd never have guessed she didn't exist. I'm pretty sure he was in on it to some degree due to rumblings I've heard, but to what I'm not sure.

As for ND fans in general, the student body seems to be pretty skeptical of him, the rest of the fan base who doesn't know him as well is pretty much buying his story entirely. 

 




 Yeah Tyler Eifert is in a one credit class right now because he's already graduated from what I've heard. 




 I always thought it was funny when I'd see someone go in to a PG-13 movie by themselves and pay the 12 year old price. 




 My guess is it had more to do with the buyout. I think once Purdue's or Michigan State's become a little more manageable we'll probably replace one of them for Michigan. 




 Ours are actually fairly smart for the most part. We had a guy a few years ago who was the first player ever I believe to be in law school while playing. 




 They weren't from players. They were from some other kid who I assume was in his dorm. 




 The Lennay Kekua Car Crash Cancer Foundation. 




 Once it had happened, I thought they handled the Declan case well. My bigger issue is it never should have happened.

For Lizzy Seeberg, obviously what happened to her is terrible. However, non-rape sexual assaults are incredibly difficult to prosecute. It all comes down to he said she said. In this case, there were inconsistencies between even what she said versus her friends. This all makes it really difficult to do anything about. I'l agree that the non-athlete friend was a complete dumbass and should have been punished for what he did assuming they could get a consensus he did it. 




 Sadly no, that's Stanford. We just have people who will date imaginary girls rather than someone actually at the school. 




 There basically hasn't been any point recently where he hasn't been with someone that was real and went here or SMC. It was what confused the shit out of me when the whole thing started in September. 




 What a coincidence. My dorm is right by a grassy knoll. 




 On the bright side it improved your chances at the Fullmer Cup. 




 Hell I think it's hilarious. I've been waiting for something to come out about this whole thing for months. I knew he wasn't actually dating her, never would have guessed she wasn't a person. 




 But does his girlfriend exist? 




 Made by Apple. 




 I've also been told there was a girl who broke up with him in September when this all came out because he told her he'd made it all up. 




 I can confirm this. He was dating someone in september too. 




 Token ND student here. That never was a question because he was hitting on girls. He was dating someone when the story came out from everything I've heard. We all thought the original story was weird. 




 I have those same Hulk hands. 




 As soon as the divisions came out all ESPN could talk about was N M and Iowa. I then remember that this is the Legends division because Michigan isn't in leaders even though it's in their fight song. 




 Or he wants everyone to know he had a girlfriend at one point.  




 I learned from the Scooby Doo movie that if you eat too many peppers and you don't have  anything to drink ketchup can cool down your tongue. 




 We tried to do this this year to let Manti play in Hawaii at the end of the year. Couldn't make it work. 




 That or:
Kelly: So I'm really excited to be moving up to the NFL with the Eagles.

Eagles: Yeah we're not so interested in you after all.

Kelly: Shit, better go back to ND. 




 So who's not irrelevant? LSU lost Saban to the NFL. USC lost Carroll. Stanford lost both Harbaugh to the NFL and Willingham to ND (They could have kept him). So unless we're arguing that Alabama is the only relevant school, then I'm not sure what makes this any different. 




 Twist: He does the press conference in ladies' underwear. 




 Davie had a much better resume than Diaco does at this point. Plus he'd actually been interim head coach for a game where we blew out Vandy I believe. 




 Notre Dame actually lives its boat shoes. 




 Please no more assaulting police officers. 




 I honestly don't think I've ever seen a worse recruiter than Ty Willingham. 




 Also Urban Meyer and Nick Saban because they're both definitely interested. 




 No, nothing should be done to limit what Lane does or USC. He should be in charge of as much as possible there. 




 I fully support this. 




 I don't mind it as much in the acronym. I think actually saying The Ohio State University is kind of obnoxious, yes, but in the acronym it at least makes it less confusing considering how many OSUs there are. 




 In fairness, that was the year where the upperclassmen were from the classes where Ty hadn't recruited oline at all. 





























 Lyk dis if u cry evertim 




 Where are you that there's this much snow? Because there as hell doesn't seem to be that much anywhere else in Indiana. 




 So then who's the Tecmo Super Bo? 




 Fortunately we figured that out this year. 




 JUCO transfers like Aaron Rodgers I'd be ok with us taking. I don't want us taking guys who had trouble qualifying academically, but if it was a skill thing I don't see a reason we couldn't, or at least have 1 exception a year for it or something. 




 AXE Body Spray: Because who doesn't want to smell like a middle school locker room? 




 I won't miss his ability to somehow make our DBs forget how to cover. 




 Same idea but with icy hot. 




 Yeah I got eliminated from valedictorian my first semester of high school when I took electives. The salutatorian was 2nd because he accidentally took an extra art class freshman year. 




 I wish this was the first thread where I'd read about someone sticking their dick in milk today. 




 He did Parks and Rec instead. 




 Terrifying. 




 They said learned how to dress. 




 Every time I see a picture of Shaun White I think why is someone talking about Carrot Top? 




 Yeah I'm at Notre Dame and our highest paid employee is our investment officer. And he's still only making a fraction of what he'd make in the private sector. 




 I have full faith in us being the first 1 seed to lose in the first round if we ever get seeded that highly. 




 Your mistake for having faith in us to win. 




 I thought everyone thought that. 




 We finally found the one person who would hit the share button when watching porn. 




 My marketing class was basically teaching us how to do market research and what you needed to know. I.e. how to figure out where to sell, who to target, what types of products will be successful, etc. 




 Best: Notre Dame beating Stanford this year.

Worst: Losing to Boston College in 2002 or the Bartman play. 




 Seeley Booth vs. Angel.

On the other side of the spectrum, Miachel Cera as George Michael and Evan would be pretty even, too. 




 Lynyrd Skynyrd, Public Enemy, and Lady Gaga. 




 Buffy taught me no. 




 I work at my campus dining hall. This kid got fired while making personal pizzas for people for insulting students, throwing knives, and using the word "nigdick", his own invention. After he graduated, this wonderful human being enrolled in seminary, but then I ran into him at a bar later and learned he dropped out because "celibacy sucks". He is one of 2 people to have fired in probably the last 6 or 7 years, the other being a student manager who gave out tequila shots to students in the basement. Another was almost fired for dealing to full time staff, but he got arrested first. 




 Doubly so for /r/funny. 




 We had a presentation from a guy that does innovation for a beer company. The one time I didn't want to see a presentation on beer. 




 But Scotty doesn't know. 




 He went to IU though. 




 I had an RA that used to do this. 




 Click. That shit was supposed to be Adam Sandler playing with time and kicking people in the balls.  




 The Ivy League is all private. 




 Ring by Spring. 




 "Memories" 




 Should have masturbated more. We talk about prostate cancer plenty. 









 The fact that the B1G is all state schools except Northwestern doesn't help either. That has the potential of being on the wrong side of a lot of votes. 




 No parents no rules! 




 And so stylish. 




 I think now it's grad students that start it and goes to seniors. No more grad students splitting sophomores and juniors. 




 I hope it was [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxq-aOiGmQU). 




 The shower's in the toilet! That's amazing! 




 Debt can even be good if you can invest the money toward something with a higher rate than the interest you're paying. If I'm paying say 4% interest on my house and I have extra money after monthly payments, I could use that money to pay off extra money on my mortgage. However, given that the market tends to average somewhere between 8 and 12% in a year that's not a crash, you're usually better off investing that money elsewhere. 




 I had this same thing happen with my ex. 




 The only one I remember was someone bought condoms and a drug test. She paid all in singles. 




 This happens to me all the time Not having Friday classes really fucks with my head. 




 It make you look like Dwight. 




 Freitag just felt wrong though. There needs to be a Yeagley coaching there forever. 




 That's a cheap wedding. 




 Next: Beer 30! 




 Beer 30 has my favorite can ever though. 




 I took it as part of a job application. It was really easy. 




 Hamm's 




 Maybe LSU is just more willing to rise above it.

In all honesty it's most likely because of the way it was phrased. If they mentioned LSU doing it, too, Louisiana probably would have been ok with it. 




 I don't think anyone underrated Samardzija when he was here. Everyone knew he was awesome. I'd go with Jimmy personally. He had a great year for us his junior year, but had an awful o-line and a defense that didn't tackle, they just pushed. Was he an asshole? Yes. But a damn good player. 




 I've been really impressed with Wilson. I think he's going to lead you guys to a level that you haven't reached since Mallory. Also the win for Hoep in 2007 was just awesome. Considering how bad 2007 was for ND, IU at least gave me something to be happy about. 




 Fucking Gary Gray and Fucking Tommy Rees. 




 I don't think I've ever had a minimum time for presentations. Questions counting for time would screw me over every time because it'd end up pushing my presentations over the time limit. 




 Shit I just assumed that's what those were. 




 My nightmares of ND football all involve Tommy. 




 That has nothing to do with snow and everything to do with it being 465. That's awful driving no matter what time of year. 




 Hell yeah Chilly Willies. 




 What part of Indiana is this? Every part I've been in has been fine driving with snow. 




 Tell that to an accounting firm. 




 I'll agree with you on that first one. We have an assload of bandwagon fans. That's pretty much what leads to all of those other 3. We get preferential treatment because we have a lot of fans so our games = ratings and people will go to them as well. It's that combined with the fact that we have a fair amount of wealthy alumni, so they'll pay to go. 3 comes mostly from the bandwagon fans. Most alumni and students have the most pessimistic views of ND. As for 4, there's no reason for us to join financially so why should we? That comes from the first 2. 




 The Big Ten is an awful idea. I'd completely prefer the ACC. The ACC has schools that are way more similar to us, such as Duke, BC, Wake, Miami, and Syracuse. In the Big Ten we'd have Northwestern. I don't want to be one of the only 2 private schools in our conference. Conference affiliation need to be about more than athletics. Only reason I'd prefer the Big Ten would be to join the Committee on Institutional Cooperation. Still don't want to join one though. 




 He threw a really pretty ball by his junior year, too. I don't think he gets enough credit for how good he was his last year because he spent 3 years with a defense that didn't know how to tackle. 




 If it's in the game, it's in the game. 




 It won't be 600. It'll be 599 US Dollars. 




 I felt like in this scenario it was the equivalent of shouting while someone is talking and saying I can't hear you.

"Please stop writing to me"

"I can't understand a word you're saying" 




 We had a 3 week debate 2 years ago about them. Started by a guy who was against them. 




 He didn't end up taking it I think. I think that was before he came back for another year to get enough credits for the CPA exam. 




 That engineering wasn't for me. Almost failed out of school before I realized it. Made the switch to business and I've enjoyed it so much more and done way better. 




 I used to live in Bloomington, so IU apparel was huge there. I worked at a Kmart, and there was one month we got a huge shipment of Oklahoma gear. I'm pretty sure someone fucked up because of the similar logos. Needless to say they didn't sell very well. 




 A friend of mine took a year off from college because he had cancer. At an interview the interviewer said "I notice you took a year off from college. Were you spending a year finding yourself?" in kind of a smarmy tone. He of course replied no, he was fighting cancer. He got an offer. 




 My roommate did this for a summer and only sold one thing. But he referred a guy who got really into it and so he made a bunch from that. 




 Fucking magnets, how do they work? 




 But that means you're missing Pigtostal! 




 We've got a couple of those. 




 It's not that we're too good to join a conference, it's that there's no reason for us to. We're not going to join one for the sake of joining one. 




 We've won national championships in women's soccer, fencing, and women's basketball recently, and are competing in each of those every year. We're also really strong in men's soccer, men's lacrosse, and men's hockey, and have a good but not great men's basketball program. I think our tennis teams are usually pretty good, too. Women's lacrosse has also been good in the last few years. Our rugby team was good until they got disbanded for selling the vans they rented to go on a trip in the 90s to buy alcohol and drugs, but it's back and doing alright. 




 Except in 1989. 




 This is why I don't want us to join the Big Ten. No desire to be on the wrong end of a bunch of 2-whatever votes. 




 It shouldn't take Mad Men for you to realize this. 




 I think I'd take another year of Eifert over Rudolph honestly. It'd be pretty close. I also think we're weaker at WR next year than TE so I'd probably go with Golden. Plus Golden was just awesome. 




 Mendoza! 




 And as Amy Poehler once said, BC is the Harvard of Boston. 




 Someone never read [The Official Pokemon Handbook](http://i.imgur.com/YOkOqpo.jpg) as a kid. 




 But whips and chains excite her. 




 For Love of the Game as well. Awful book, great movie. To a lesser extent, Field of Dreams also. 




 Always glad to help. 




 Seems like you would have had trouble typing that then.

 ND-USC has been much more consistent as a rivalry than ND-Michigan though. We've been playing playing USC almost every year since the 20s. Michigan has been off and on. 




 All girls are suckers for that neckbeard. 




 Quick! Someone call Kevin Bacon! 




 Would have been better if she'd said wicked smart. 




 I'd never have believed it if he hadn't assured me it was true. 




 No that's just katy. 




 And that's why you always leave a note. 
























 About 8 years ago we used to have a commercial for a car place whose tag line was "If the tranny is dead, just call Fred." I always used to think it sounded like it should be a slogan for a really shady law firm, a la Saul Goodman. 




 I felt so cool back in the 5th or 6th grade when I broke into my friend's lego club account by answering his security question. Back when everyone had Harry Potter as what's your favorite book? 




 A significant portion of Indiana actually hates Notre Dame. 




 I've never seen a bad puppet episode. 




 1 tequila, 2 tequila, 3 quetila, floor.

FTFY 




 There's a lot of drinks where you won't taste the alcohol after the 4th or 5th one. 




 She did in the wishverse. And the comics. 




 Pigfarts Pigfarts, here I come. Pigfarts Pigfarts, yum yum yum. 




 Back when I was still in Civil Engineering, every other major had all these guys complaining about how there were no girls. We were at about 50/50. Apparently girls only become civil engineers. 




 And the Aarons have the most Home Run by brothers even though Tommie only had 13. In fairness they still manage to beat all 3 DiMaggio brothers though. 




 Super Saiyan Dwight. 




 And in fairness on the decommitting from Indiana thing, it was because he didn't like they way they treated his brother. 




 The last 5 minutes of Cheers was absolutely incredible. 




 What if I told you that being it wasn't all it's cracked up to be? A Children's Game: Part of ESPN's 30 for 30. 




 Your goodwill sells DVDs? Mine still only has VHS. 




 Yeah I should have clarified. That movie didn't portray what happened with Rudy well at all. But Indiana as a place was portrayed fairly accurately. Devine never would have stood for the whole giving up jerseys thing, and the players never would have thought to do it either. And the chanting was mostly joking/sarcastic. 




 My senior year of high school we had to take a fairy tale and rewrite it as film noir. We chose little bunny foo foo. The Good Fairy was a mob boss. 




 Alpha as fuck. 




 THE Ohio State. 




 A friend of mine apparently broke up with his girlfriend as an April Fools Joke. I'm still waiting to see how that went over. 




 A lot of the state is, honestly. I've spent some pretty boring days in random small towns because we didn't want to drive home between basketball games in the playoffs. Because it's always the random small towns that have gyms that hold 10,000 people. 




 I've always liked Deshaun Thomas. Disappointed his team didn't make it far enough his senior year of high school for him to end up the all time leading scorer in Indiana history. 




 Hulls is at least 5'11", and might be up to 6'. I've never stood back to back with him, but he always seemed pretty close in height with me. 




 Yeah the biggest inaccuracy I can think of are that the buildings in Rudy that are supposed to be Holy Cross are actually at Notre Dame. That and I'm not sure there's ever been a South Bend shovel slayer. Hoosiers was pretty much spot on, Breaking Away, too. 




 I thought LA was already Lob City though. 




 Land Before Time got run so far into the ground it made it all the way to China. 




 Better dead than orangered. 




 Those orangered bastards. 




 Look at how nice I am while I'm calling you a dumbo bimbo bitch. 




 Guys, what's the fourth? 




 We'll end up finishing somewhere in the upper middle of the ACC. This will give us a seed somewhere between 5 and 10. We'll then proceed to lose our first game in the tournament. 




 A good Easter for Notre Dame. 




 Isn't it always? 




 I agree. Just because someone with a suit can pull off a fedora, doesn't mean they looked better with them on. Even then, they were for function. It was just the acceptable hat to wear with a suit. 




 He definitely halved the value of the car if he's lucky. 




 For a second I thought the blue pie was drinking, but I see now your priorities were indeed correct. 




 He didn't own the Bobcats when this came out. 




 The Pope doesn't even have the power to execute priests. And if they did that'd be an even bigger set of issues I would think. 




 They're just downvoting. 




 81x7. 




 Yeah they decided to go as people in the Justice League. Local news never caught on. 




 [What this meme should be.](http://qkme.me/3tlsnc) 




 Unfortunately only about half, though. 




 This whole time I was under the impression that atheists were smarter and superior to the rest of us. 




 Some guys in my dorm did [this](http://www.abc57.com/video/Avengers-assemble-Summer-movie-season-kicks-off-150154375.html) last year. 




 It's there now. 




 Shit how many people do we send to USC? I thought it was weird even having the 1 from my grade, and I'm guessing you're not the same person. 




 The may be senile old men, but they're our senile old men. 




 I bet he's a such a "nice guy" though. It's not fair that no one wants to be with him. 




 If this is how he acts, I doubt he was having a lot of sex in high school. 




 The Dobler-Dahmer effect. 




 Isn't that basically multiple personality disorder? 




 While I was in high school our team had 2 losses to Oden and Conley, one to Gordon, and one to Hayward. I believe we also had 4 wins over the Teagues. Never got to play the Zellers.  




 Yeah Sampson got a few guys likes Gordon, but a huge issue was that for most part his guys weren't serious about basketball. He was essentially running a program like Blue Mountain State. The only guys who weren't getting stoned and drunk all the time his last year were Gordon and White, which is part of the reason neither came back. And why a lot of the guys in state weren't considering it.

Side note, posts like these just remind me of how much talent the state produces. I think half my high school's losses while I was there were to nba lottery picks. 




 I still wonder how different things would be if the whole O'Leary lying thing hadn't happened and we managed to hire him. 




 Hulls wasn't even going to consider IU when Sampson was there. And he hasn't known anything but IU for pretty much his whole life. 




 At least they still have Bob Davie. 




 In fairness, Wooden went to Purdue. That said I have nothing but respect for UCLA and our mutual hatred of USC. 




 I'm not sure there was ever an age where it was acceptable to wear rip off pants to a dance. Or anywhere besides athletics. 




 I see what you're doing here Chevy. /r/HailCorporate No more of your clever advertising. 




 I don't know that I remember a time where my bedtime was that early. 




 I had a friend with long blonde hair. When he went to bars guys would come up to him and ask if they could buy him a drink. He would just turn around and say sure. 




 I love the kid having the phone conversation in the background. 




 Yeah this definitely made the aim buddy info rounds. Because what 13 year old doesn't think this is hilarious? 




 Maybe she was just orgasming over his incredible guitar playing. 




 Leave your door open. That's how you meet people. 




 I say it because my 4th grade teacher drilled it into our heads. 




 /r/stopgirl So simple. So great. 




 Still only allowed if you don't get her off before you finish. Source: Catholic school. 




 The fact that he had crushes on that many girls clearly means he didn't date much in high school. As does him deciding this was a good idea. 




 As long as he was making shit up, I half expected him to get invited back for a threesome. 




 M'LADY 




 The Monstars. 




 I hope this account comes back in 9 months. 




 I plan to start saying this now. 




 I bet he skipped leg day. 




 Hell I actually confronted one. We'd dated for a month or so earlier then gone back to being friends. Then she started acting like she had feelings for me again a few months later. Finally after about a month of that I confronted her about it and called her out on it. We ended up dating for a few years after that. 




 I believe they returned 2.2 ppg his first year. 1.8 from Taber and 0.4 from some other walk on. 




 I'm just jealous that those are the lows. I'd take them as the highs. 




 I always like to ask people who talk about Lynyrd Skynyrd to name 3 songs by them. A lot of them can't. 




 When I used to work at KMart we had someone try to return an open box of condoms. He was told we couldn't give him his money for an opened box. His response: "How else was I supposed to know if they fit if I didn't try one on?" He got his money back right away so that he would go away. 




 I choose to believe somewhere out there there's people who like those bizarre sex moves. 




 Thug means never having to say you're sorry. 




 Except it would flood the market. you have to ration them out. Like diamonds. 




 This is also before UCLA was the UCLA it is now. Minnesota is much closer to the Minnesota of the 40s, without the benefit of a strong football team. 




 Also Puff lives by the sea. I'm not sure he'd want to leave that weather for Minnesota. For Santa it's practically tropical though. 




 Good job getting Tyrone to dress up like Luigi. 




 Or you can text them then offer $100 when they say they're waiting until marriage. 




 And yet he's still half hover handing. 




 They are always right. 




 Mine has Duke over Miami in the finals, with Arizona and Florida in my final four. The coin knows all apparently. 




 Well it's not like Luke had good options for leaving. 




 We don't even own that, we sold it to some Europeans. 




 I don't have class for about 9 hours. 




 Sociopath Steve? 




 Ask some females what they think of fedoras. 




 Hey now, don't forget the short sleeve button ups with flames. 




 Well not necessarily that good. I more just meant guys who weren't talented enough in high school but had the grades but went juco to try to get into a better program. I'm ok with taking jucos who went that route because of talent, just not grades. 




 I have those scissors! 




 DAE remember 2005? Only real 90s kids get this. 
























 Actually they usually say valid at McDonald's only. 




 Also an awful drinking game. 




 I was once told to reinstall the game. I wasn't sure how that would help. 




 Scrubs: A show about the men TLC rejected. 




 Don't hate on Mad Dog. It was one of the higher ranked choices for my "how drunk can I get for $5?" game. First place was far and away 2 cans of either Four Loko or Snoop Dogg Blast, the Colt .45 answer to Four Loko. A beautiful product. 




 Get the cans that just say beer. 




 Accountant? 




 Man we're talking about practice. Not a game, not a game. Practice. 




 That's why he's too busy to study for accounting. 




 My mall still has 2 Gamestops thanks to the EB Gamestop merger. 




 In all likelihood it's due to the new ACC contract where we have to play 5 teams a year from the ACC. Michigan was probably the least expensive game to cut, and most people here think it'll be added again once Purdue or MSU run out their contract. 




 The administration also refuses to build a basketball practice facility. 




 I went and finally did all the Heisman Challenges I'd never gotten around to last week. 




 Tons. 




 Make them support only. For wards, healing, stuns, etc. 




 Don't forget probably the most unbeatable NBA record. Sheed's 41 technicals in a season. Still technically possible, you just have to get one in almost every game you play. 




 One of my friends got a letter from them telling him he'd been in the top 10 in bandwidth used in the area for 3 or 4 straight months and to please stop or they'll look into what he's doing more closely or something to that effect. He was pretty proud. 




 It's really not. Having a few of each type that you can play is part of the strategy. 




 Honestly as long as you can play a few it doesn't really matter. If you can play 2 champs of each type you're pretty much set. And a pro would need a max of 5 champions that he can play, since their roles are set, and that's assuming the other team was so worried about him that they used all their bans on his champs and the person in the same role on their team also picked one that he played. 




 Honestly you're probably going to be worse off. If you've only unlocked champions you like you've probably played those ones more, meaning you're better with them. If you have too many you're not going to be good with any of them. And even if you did get more, if you're only good with a few it doesn't matter about the others.

Also if you play ARAM (All Random, All Middle) having more champions is a big disadvantage.
 




 I had a friend get yelled at for ap yi in aram once. 




 Maybe she was in the middle of king's cup and was question master. 




 A friend of mine from high school is dating a girl like this. Fortunately it's been 5 years and he hasn't noticed. 




 So would a lot of moms. 




 I had a friend who thought that you couldn't have sex during the day. That's why we had visiting hours between 9am and midnight for our dorms. What confused me most is that on weekends visiting hours didn't end until 2. Apparently she switched schools a few times in high school and managed to miss sex ed entirely. 




 I've always wanted to fight a dragon. 




 Class dismissed. 




 Yeah she's avoided it on multiple musical episodes between this and Buffy now. 




 You say no to ratchet pussy, JuicyJ can't! 




 Use Your Allusion. 




 Man Alyson Hannigan really hates singing. 




 Wow awesome, that fixed it. 




 Yeah that's when it started. 




 Oh cool, I thought that was just me. It also does this when I try to save item sets. 




 I kind of agree with you. My opinion is Buffy would have better individual episodes. I think there are a lot of Buffy episodes that are better than pretty much any Angel episode on an episode by episode basis. But Angel had way better overall storyline and plot arcs. I felt like Angel was actually building somewhere, especially since it had a consistent enemy throughout the show. Plus obviously the redemption story for everyone in the show was great. I feel like Angel just got much deeper. 




 I had a Catholic brother as the rector of my dorm in college. He had been in rehab the semester before I got there for alcoholism. He was absolutely oustanding, for the record, the entire time I was there. I imagine the loneliness is part of it. I think for him at least, a big part of it was the temptation was there all the time. It's got to be a lot harder to stay sober when you see college kids getting drunk on a tuesday. That said, it also made his talks about the dangers of alcohol and alcoholism a lot more powerful. 




 Read that as Uncle Phil and was confused. Though I'd watch Uncle Phil teach a kid to be street smart. 




 And yet Trevor Mbakwe was allowed to come back for a 6th year when he lost a year because he had legal issues. 




 We'd had problems for a while, and had always had fights over really dumb stuff. She was clingy and had a distinct lack of trust. She'd accuse me of cheating even though I was spending all my free time with her (apparently those group project I had were made up so I could go hook up with other girls). These were all exacerbated by distance when she graduated and I had a year left.

The straw that broke the camel's back, however, was a game of League of Legends. We would play together a fair amount. She was a pretty inconsistent player, though, so she'd have some pretty bad games. League's community being what it is, she'd get yelled at sometimes in game. Finally, after being told to stop feeding and eventually to uninstall, she quit in the middle of the game and within a week it was basically over. And that is how League of Legends ended my relationship. 




 Who doesn't love a nice beersicle though? 




 Harvard basically gets the racial percentages in america for each class. Exactly as diverse as the county as a whole. 




 Ours were like 50 people crammed into a dorm room with probably at least 10 cases. 




 We had a challenge in our library where you had to drink a beer on every floor. 14 floors. No using the elevator. 




 I paid less to go to an expensive private school than I would have to go to a state school. Yay for starting college right after the market tanked. 




 Just don't forget about it. 




 Heroes get remembered, but legends never die. 




 Named after "Far Quad" at Notre Dame. 




 Holy shit I'd completely forgotten about eon8. 




 Possibly in relation to the remake of the original they'll be coming out with soon, as well as the possibility of an announcement about fable 4. 




 For Love of the Game. 




 He's also incredibly self centered. Just watch his interaction with George Michael. 




 I've used organizing Humans vs. Zombies on campus as an example in a ton of interviews. 




 And if we do decide to do change the helmet, at least make it even. Let's not have another 2/3 of one color and 1/3 of the other anytime soon. 




 My guess is Michigan comes back eventually in place of MSU and/or Purdue, once those buyouts are more manageable. 




 In all honesty this may have killed any notion of us ever joining the B1G. It wasn't that likely anyway, but it was definitely going to be up for a lot of consideration if it ever became necessary to join a conference for football.  However, given the history of feelings such as this, going all the way back to Yost and his telling us we couldn't join because we were Catholic, it just seems unlikely.  




 What bothered me wasn't even the Catholic comments as much, it was the fact that he singled out Fr. Joyce. Don't speak ill of the dead, especially one of your contemporaries. It felt like a completely unnecessary potshot. 




 And this is why straddling is often a bad decision. 




 I worked there 5 years ago. Their goal is to straddle the 2. They showed us some video about how Walmart is the cheap store and Target is the trendy store. They wanted to be the smart store. 




 Yeah to me half the point of college is the experience. You don't get that going to CC or even a commuter college. 




 Community College isn't always cheaper long term. Yes, tuition is lower, but you also can miss out on a lot of scholarships the only make available to freshmen, making your long term tuition higher. 




 Tie between two people. One would be Chris Stevens. Grew up in foster homes. Ends up being good enough at basketball to get a scholarship to Notre Dame. Plays on the team that stops UCLA's 88 game win streak. After school goes to play in Europe for a year before working for Proctor and Gamble and then running a Budweiser distributor. Finally gets tired of that and helps to found Keurig. After having done that for a while he's retired now and just funds interesting projects and is now teaching at Notre Dame.

The other would be Alasdair MacIntyre.  He's one of the most highly regarded philosophers in the world and incredibly interesting to listen to. 




 I believe he's more of a Jimmy John's and Krispy Kreme fan. 




 All the accents in that were really impressive. 




 Which is almost sad considering she won a Tony. 




 On the other hand if Hitler hadn't risen to power, someone similar might have. And that person might have been more strategically sound than Hitler.

 The sun is out an hour longer during Daylight Saving Time. 




 But cops have to tell you if they're a cop if you ask them! 




 Salary cap is a bitch. 




 Baseball. 




 Carla was Dominican. Not being white =/= black. 




 Children might have seen that! 




 My favorite still goes to "Out. for. a. walk....bitch." 




 He needs a new accountant if he's paying 37% on 70k a year. 




 Ooie Pooie! 




 The next dorms are going up east of Knott and PE. Right on the newly minted Knott Quad. I think there might also be plans for another 2 on West Quad. 




 Hey he looked great against us. I'm pretty sure ESPN was ready to proclaim him the next combination of Montana Elway and Marino combined. 




 (`) 




 People actually have this issue? Now if the questions could somehow decrease time, that'd be helpful. 









 Nate Montana is probably the worst quarterback I've ever had the misfortune of watching. This includes high school games. He came in against Michigan a few years ago and wasn't throwing picks like Tommy Rees was because he didn't have enough accuracy or arm strength to get it near anyone. Absolutely awful. 




 Golic was easily the weakest part of our O-Line this year. And the year before he filled in for Cave at center when he got hurt. He must have been telegraphing terribly because suddenly every D-Line we played jumped right at the snap. I'd be shocked if he's on the roster when games start. 




 I very much doubt it happens, but Troy Niklas is a guy who at least has first round potential. It'd take a pretty big year, but the dude is a beast. 




 And become some combination of bigger and faster. 




 Whoosh 




 They're just happy anyone's going to the game instead of tailgating through it. 




 Hufflepuffs are particularly good finders. 




 In fairness, who wants to be the guy that tackles one of your best defensive players and accidentally takes him out for the year? 




 Boom/Mordor/Smack a Hoe

Everyone stands around a table. There's a bunch of cups with about as much beer as you'd used for pong or flip cup, and one that's all the way full for the last person. 2 people are playing at once. It usually starts with people on opposite sides of the table. The goal is to bounce a ping pong ball into your cup. If you do that, you pass to your left. If you make it on your first try, you can pass it anywhere. If the person to your right manages to make one before you do, they slap your cup of the way, pass their cup to the person on your left, and you have to drink a new one. It goes until the last cup gets finished, and that person is the loser. 




 I almost drunkenly bought this last week. 




 And then those lucky one or two people get thunderfucked and have to drink through an entire verse. 




 A kid I went to high school with's sister did Girls Gone Wild. She apparently made it into the commercial for that one, too. So he, his sister, and his parents are watching something like Comedy Central late at night and the commercial comes on. He sees his sister, looks over at his family, and walks out and goes to bed. He never asked about anything after that. 




 It's a one hot album every 10 year average. 




 That's where they're from. 




 Yeah I understood the point which was they did better in low scoring games, but it came across that way. 




 I loved during the NCAA tournament one year they were talking about how Wisconsin did really well when they held their opponents under 50 or some really low number. It just seemed so monotonous and obvious that they did well when they held the other team to a low number of points.  




 It's like Pavlov. 




 I also bought a ds with mario kart. 




 Hey I won the fall 2005 one! 
























 Someone really ought to let the [gameday website](http://gameday.nd.edu/experience/athletic/) know about this. They still have it as a stadium tradition. 




 Fuck that. You always sing the alma mater. 




 He really hasn't improved that much since he was a freshman. He had a solid floor as a freshman, but pretty much no upside. 




 I hate the K. Not that I know what I'd replace it with, but the K looks weird. The Ws and Ls just looked so much nicer. 




 What if it's petty theft? 




 Get more in the bank. It's all about the frenzy lucky combo. 




 What if I learned something yesterday? Am I allowed to post it here? 




 I've never wanted anyone in a TV show to die more than I do Jesse right now. He just needs to be put out of his misery. That or he, Badger and Skinny Pete need to go get a farm in the middle of Idaho and chill there and watch Star Trek. 




 And who knows what happened to J.D. McCoy either. West Dillon had a black QB in season 5. Lance didn't like his BFF getting replaced. 




 I took a Business Problem Solving class in college. Probably my favorite class in my 4 years. Lot of being given problems and finding solutions. We'd bring in guests with problems and then write up memos and presentations about our solution. 




 I'm pretty sure this happened with Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis, except for the her not remembering it thing. Have you taken her to meet your Alzheimer's father and then fallen in love with her yet? 




 It's been this price on Amazon for months. 




 They're not going to be that successful streaming if they weren't competing at the highest level. It's the same with professional athletes. Someone like Tiger Woods or Michael Jordan made way more money from endorsements than they did from playing. But no one's going to pay you for it unless they were competing at the highest level. No one wants to buy shoes from Michael Jordan the random guy who went to school in North Carolina. 




 To show off your deceptive speed. 




 I think I still have PTSD with Crazy Train. 




 When aren't they? 




 Don't try to fight Carlo Calabrese. His people will get you. 




 That doesn't change the fact that Kelly's playcalling is also horrendous. 




 No I know today. But today is definitely a first from Big Ten refs. 




 I really thought that was against Robinson. Since when do B1G refs give us calls? 




 I'm terrified of what the commentary will be like when we play you. I'm not sure NBC will notice there's a game. 




 I would watch the shit out of a show where Jason Sudeikis coaches in the Premier League though. 




 In fairness, there's a video on the NBC sports website about Tommy Reese. 




 The Rex Grossman era Bears strategy. 




 I've been so spoiled by Amazon Prime. Had to send an Xbox into Microsoft for warranty repair and Fedex ground doesn't compare to 2 day UPS. 




 Finally something that makes me feel better about We Are ND. 




 But we need to be able to ask people what time the narwhal bacons so we can feel super cool. 




 Time for everyone to wear breakaway pants. 




 Snapchat selfie is the clear winner. 




 My middle school decided too many kids were looking at porn. They blocked google images. This was 7th grade, so half our presentations were find pictures of something and put them on a powerpoint.

My high school also didn't want people using the internet in one of the computer labs that was only used for computer classes, so they just deleted the browsers off those computers. It didn't take us long to realize you can browse in Windows Explorer. 




 "Make it so" OP, nerf pls. 




 I choose to believe you're not married and are actually going out to find a wife, not that you are and she's in another room or something. 




 If it were 5, I don't think Kmart or Target get any, since I'm sure Amazon is getting plenty, too. 




 There were middle school valedictorians? 




 You're not all good at hiding it. We had this super old English teacher in my high school who everyone knew had a flask in her desk. But she'd been there so long that she taught all the Vice Principals, so no one could really fire her. 




 I work at an IT help desk at a large state school. We also do work for a major community college system. It's amazing how many 20 year olds don't want to call in to have their password reset and have their parents call instead. Joke's on them because they still have to talk thanks to FERPA. 




 My issue with Weis is that he gets too cute. He wants to prove with his offense how smart he is instead of just using his players who are flat out better than the other team. Granted Kansas doesn't have players like that, so maybe he's a good fit. 




 Nah, he fails upward. Bama time. 




 We're already paying Weis to coach at Kansas, I'm sure we'd be happy to pay Kiffin to coach at USC. 




 I worked at a retail store for a while that had stopped selling CDs. So there was no display for them at all. I would have people ask me to check the back for CDs. Like we just kept all of them in the back so no one could buy them. 




 I don't care what system you're in, that's pretty impressive for a true freshman walk on. 




 Michigan sounded like they were going to cancel, too. They were just mad that it got cancelled with us getting 2 of the last 3 home games. 




 I prefer shitted. Like the midget from Trapped in the Closet. 




 I had a P.E. volleyball class the morning after St. Patrick's day my freshman year. Out of 30 people in the class, I think 6 or so had to leave class to throw up that day. That was probably the worst volleyball I've seen in my life. 




 There have been a lot of really inappropriate songs on Kidz Bop. Toxic was another. 




 It wouldn't have been able to have half those actors, though. 




 The lack of assists makes me wonder how they were even thinking those could be steals. 




 I've been hyperventilating since I read it. 




 And in greater numbers. 




 So you're 11? 




 Apparently they don't require the rappers to be nice like they do the girls. 




 I had a friend do really well with them. Not because he sold that many knives, but he recruited a friend of his to do that who sold a ton of knives. It's all about putting the pyramid scheme to work for you. 




 Fuck Free World, 313. 




 I especially find it weird when they say we. Personally I think you should only say we about an organization you've been a part of in some fashion.   




 I had a friend get asked "you're one of those asians, aren't you?" at a Taco Bell in Alabama. Not meant to be racist or anything. The woman genuinely wasn't sure. 




 Rolling Rock is also a little above the price point of what I'd consider cheap beer though. I'd go with Natty, Keystone, PBR, and Hamms, with Miller Lite, Coors Light and Bud Light being around the top end of that. 




 Thug means never having to say you're sorry. 




 As far as cheap beer goes it's not too bad. I'll take it over natty or keystone. 




 And at least for Worlds that's in September/October. You're competing with playoff baseball, the NFL and college football. If I own a sports bar, I'm not bumping the end of the regular season or beginning of the playoffs for esports, and definitely not football. 




 I once had someone complain about how hipsters had ruined PBR because she drank it before they made it cool. I gave her a look and started to question her before she realized the irony of that statement. 




 I mean honestly, how often does anyone actually use the extra pockets in cargo shorts? I'm not sure I've ever used them in any pair I've worn. 




 I've driven some automatics with fairly weak engines that still rollback. Sucks in those, too. 




 Yeah for real, O'Rourke's is the CJ's of Eddy Street. 




 It's all about the salmon shorts now, yo. 




 Yeah Papa Smurfs from Between the Buns are probably a better option in that regard. Plus they already sponsor a bunch of minor sports anyway. I have a bunch of shirts from volleyball games that have Between the Buns ads on the back. 




 I say we go for fuck buckets from Feve. If for no other reason than I refuse to drink a Clover Quart from anything other than a mason jar, and that would get dangerous. Papa Smurfs would also be acceptable. 




 Also Willow and Wesley Wyndam-Price. 




 Make it TheYourTube. It's cleaner. Like TheNetflick. 




 Well I said Catholicism because for example Gordan Gee specified Catholics. Fielding Yost, while it was a long time ago, was definitely specifically anti-Catholic (also anti-immigrant). 




 One issue is that we don't want to be on the wrong end of a public vs. private school vote. Another is the history of anti-Catholicism in the B1G. 




 Just because they were amateurs doesn't mean they haven't dedicated their lives to it. College athletes are also amateurs (most anyway), but that doesn't mean they haven't spent most of their life dedicated to that sport. 




 They actually don't because they're available to everyone. If your school was free you wouldn't have to worry about scholarship limits. That's how Nebraska had such good walk on players for a while. They were pretty cheap in state. 




 The guy who played him was apparently just as excited. He kept asking when they would film that scene. 




 I didn't choose the Vayne Life, the Vayne Life chose me. 




 Runeless: An ESPN 30 for 30 production. 




 99 Luftballons. 




 I like to imagine they actually said LOL. 




 I had a guy on the other team be late because he was making Kool-Aid. It was grape though so it was ok. 




 I've had a few books that were kind of old that I needed before, I ended up paying $3.99 to ship a book that cost me a penny. One semester I think I spent almost as much in shipping as I did on books, not that I was complaining at that point. 




  (`)  




 I can't wait for ranked ARAM. 




 That's not even the tri state I know of that has Indiana, I consider it Indiana Ohio Michigan, since that's where Trine/Tri-State University is. 




 Honestly it's lack of talent. The Bulls are ridiculously deep, hence the strong regular season records, but star power wins championships. 




 Sorry, by that I meant season ending losses, i.e. playoffs series losses, since that's where their success was being questioned. 




 Catholic theology at the very least has a place for the "righteous pagans". Basically that the people who were good people but were never introduced to Christianity and therefore never had the chance to be saved can still be saved in the afterlife.  




 In fairness though, in the 3 years under Thibs, there's been 2 losses to the Heat, which imo are understandable due to the fact that Miami is flat out more talented at the top, and one where they lost right after their star and really only major scorer was hurt. They didn't have time to learn to play without him.  




 Because the Bulls have been showing a tendency to take any opponent for granted for the last 2 years. They basically play every game like it's the finals. 




 It's not anymore. 




 Just outside the last decade but the Cha Cha Slide will definitely be one. And the Cupid Shuffle in that same vein. Basically songs that have their own set of dance moves to go with it, preferably said during the song. 




 Truly the greatest song about [military bears](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twQlpFrm5iM). 




 5 years ago when minimum wage was still $6.55 Walmart was paying between 7 and 8 an hour by me. Target and Kmart were both paying $6.55. 




 I think she's got some vaginal hubris. 




 The second has Urkel though. 




 Of the 4 girls I've dated, 2 are married, one's engaged, and one's living with her boyfriend. The pattern seems to be marriage 5 years after they date me. I'm like a delayed version of Good Luck Chuck.

I should mention I just turned 23. 




 Kanye didn't become famous until after 9/11! I sense a conspiracy! 




 How exactly do you determine the sexuality of someone born 2000 years ago? Not to mention all the time he spent hanging out with prostitutes. 




 I had a boss last year who would tell all kinds of stories from his youth about stealing cars and drinking and doing drugs, all at the same time of course, and would always justify them with "It was the 70's". 




 I hope the prime directive doesn't often come into question in your marriage. 




 I was told to reinstall once. It didn't make me any better. 




 I enjoy the irony of people complaining about a feminist being important in gaming being the post right above 3 female cosplay posts. 
























 I think that might be less than what my high school drew, and I'm from Indiana. I know we got more than that for basketball pretty regularly for weekend games. 




 I'm still lobbying to let Muffet McGraw, our women's basketball coach, coach as many teams as possible. 




 I bet Kansas would let you have another former coach of yours named Charlie back. 




 Not really singing, more just waxing poetic. Though I guess it's similar to the way Shatner sings, so there's that. 




 I fucked Ted. 




 So are the other 2. 




 Don't hate on CJ's. Bar of choice for football players and who wouldn't be distracted by all the people under 21 there? 




 I could see that if it were the Beatles or Michael Jackson, or someone equally big. I'm not sure the Beastie Boys are quite big enough to be listened to 250 years from now. Sabotage never even made it onto the Billboard Hot 100. 




 Katana umbrella, even better. 




 As does Captain Kirk, who apparently drives to 250 year old music. 




 He looks like The Situation. 




 This and clearing cache and cookies. Solves 95% of my calls about things that aren't working. 




 Navy does that to us all the time. Niumatalolo says it's ok because they play for Navy. I'm fine with the cut blocking, they don't have the athletes to keep up otherwise and I understand that. It's the flagrant dirty hits after the play's over that are 15 yards away from the ball that I have the issue with. 




 Fair enough, Northwestern might as well be in the leaders division though. 




 I understand that, I just figure if one of the teams has a division's name in its fight song, you might as well make that division the one they're in. 




 How was Michigan not put in the Leader division? 




 My complaint is more at plays like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcTaRThg2mQ) 




 This is why I hate playing Navy. So many cheap hits. 




 I'm pretty sure we always lead the country in 6'8" unathletic white guys. 




 Yeah, I'm a huge Hulls fan, but you have to go with Zeke here. 




 My favorite Gunner Kiel moment was at one point he tweeted something and ended it with #GunnerKielQuotes . Alpha move right there. 




 My issue with Rees is that he reached his ceiling about 3 years ago. His ceiling is not high enough to win us a championship without great players around him, and probably a Heisman candidate at running back. Golson has a much higher ceiling, and is a better fit for Kelly's offense. 




 Ross Browner and friends were pretty good for us in the 70s after leaving for a year. 




 Things Boys Do We Love. 




 Baylor hasn't been in shootouts though. Yeah it gave up 42 to WVU, but who cares when you score 73. That's not a close game at all. Their closest game is a 2 score game over the defending conference champion (who admittedly is nowhere near what they were last year). 




 A 19 year old complained about getting carded? I'd understand maybe if they were like a young looking 30 year old or something who maybe looked 24, but a 19 year old is barely old enough anyway. 




 I have him, and of course the guy I play today has Megatron. 




 Title IX, yo. 




 To be honest, though, even without the rule, a top 8 Notre Dame is going to a BCS bowl. Honestly a top 12 Notre Dame probably is. That has nothing to do with a sweetheart deal with the BCS, and everything to do with our fanbase. The same is true of an at large Texas or Alabama or USC or Ohio State. Financially it just makes more sense for the bowls to take those schools. 




 Which for the record, is actually a more difficult rule than the non AQ conference teams. They have to be in the top 12. Granted it's much easier for us to be in the top 8 than them be in the top 12, but that's more a product of who we play. 




 Not to mention I can't imagine he'd be feeling great during the game given the altitude. 




 Nixon's foreign affairs wasn't terrible either. He did open up relations with China. 




 At this rate in 3 years he'll win a national championship. 




 Please no. 




 Well we already know Rees can't outrun cops so they wouldn't have too much trouble catching him. 




 Hey now, they did manage to to hold the running game under 250 yards. 




 Dan Fox holding onto that leg for dear life. 




 Thanks for the PTSD, ND. 




 How was that not a block in the back? 




 He watches game film of the 2011 Michigan game for help. 




 The Tommy Rees vs Michigan special. 




 I could have made that pass. 




 In fairness most teams will see a pretty substantial drop off to their 3rd string QB, which is basically what Hendrix is. 




 Bring back the Irish Chocolate package. 100% TD rate to this point. 




 I've known all year he was our best option. My issue with Tommy is we're not winning a championship with him. He's a 9-10 win QB. Nothing wrong with that, it still means he's a good QB. It's just that someone like Golson has the potential to win a championship someday. 




 This would work a lot better if we believed in fullbacks. 




 I'd probably rather not. Tommy ought to be back next week, or at least by the time we play someone we can't beat with Hendrix. It'd be a shame to burn a redshirt for a quarter and a half, even if it is SC. I'd rather just run all game. 




 Poor Dayne. Couldn't catch a break. 




 [The Observer](http://www.ndsmcobserver.com/sports/kelly-says-tuitt-stumbled-into-question-about-future-1.3095756#.UmM2xvleZ8F). 




 Who's ready to start running the triple option? 




 Tuitt's playing better now that he's not going pro after this year. 




 The occasional good plays do not a good QB make.  




 I miss Manti. 




 Carlson and Zibby were the only bright spots on that 2007 team. 




 Last time one did the SEC got screwed. 




 Best player ever in ppr. 




 And those aren't even the home games they coached. There's probably more that have coached less than 14 at home. 




 I would be so conflicted if Sexy Rexy coached at USC. 




 That makes more sense. I was wondering who could have possibly lost a flair bet to Purdue. 




 And you're Eskimo brothers through Montana. 




 The main reason I liked City better was I felt like there was more to do. Aside from the main story Asylum was basically just go get Riddler trophies. City had a bunch of other side quests. 




 It's not often you see Berkeley calling another school nerdy. 




 So half the people wouldn't show up to vote and then would forget about politics until the next election when they make sure they're registered? This is how my fantasy leagues go. 




 Oh ok, I was wondering why she was making a pizza while shaving her legs. 




 Good field position is an understatement. He was handed 7 points, and basically giftwrapped another 14. 




 The Lout Holtz approach. A few years ago Lou was talking about how Weis would have an easier time coaching when we played at BC because he was used to playing in the Boston area and his mind would be right. He then said he always felt like if he got to coach at William and Mary while he was coach at ND, he would have coached a great game. One of the other guys called him out on it and said yeah and they would have had a Heisman caliber QB and been favored by 30 points according to you. No one could talk up Army or Purdue like Lou Holtz. 




 Personally I think USC needs a coach with major college experience. Maybe one who's won a major conference and gone to a BCS Bowl like the Rose Bowl. One who's coached places like Stanford and Notre Dame, who has ties to California recruiting and the west coast.

The only option is Lionel Tyrone Willingham.  




 Fuck that bullshit. I'm a Dem in Indiana, but I loved Richard Lugar. Tea Party tries to oust him with an idiot like Mourdock. They could have, too, until he started talking. Thank God the strategy backfired and we got Lugar 2.0 in Donnelly but from the Democrat side. 




 My guess is it's not so much sneak attack dates as they don't want to date outside the church, and figure they'll just be upfront about it. 




 Windows-C also does this. 




 Now if I refer to him as Brobama, where does that fit in in terms of respect? 




 It wasn't 3 time all american, it was 3 year letter winner. 




 A Mac Mini. 




 I would watch a 50 shades movie if it starred Seth Rogen and Emma Stone. 




 But aren't they all "Nice Guys"? 




 I'd like to thank Purdue for not playing this week. 




 We need the NBC 360 cam! 




 Or you have Sam Bradford who stayed another year after being projected to go #1, got injured and barely played, and still went #1. 




 South Carolina has also lost to the only good team they've played. 




 I call shenanigans. That puts the game over in the over/under. Clearly something is amiss here. 




 Yeah, I mean I won't complain about an almost game winning pick, but you need to just bat that down unless you've got nothing but grass between you and the end zone. 




 Could've been a big play.... except for the overthrow and the holding. 




 There was one play where Lombard was blocking 3 people successfully. It was ridiculous. 




 ND doesn't even have a parks and recreation major! Clearly ASU  ND academically. 




 I'm not sure there are too many schools left that USC plays that could actually upset them anyway. 




 Brindza may not be the most accurate kicker, but he's got a hell of a leg. 




 And an 80 yard run against Air Force 2 years ago! 




 How I foresee the rest of this game playing out: We get a TD at some point, one more FG for ASU. We're driving down the field as time's running out at the end of the game. Kelly starts calling pass plays inside the 10 and Tommy throws an INT, instead of trying to kick the FG, Graham beats us at dream job #3. 




 Torii Hunter, Jr. 




 Did anyone else know that Corey Robinson's dad is David Robinson, the NBA player? 




 That's one of the reasons Utah schools do well. They have a bunch of players 2 years older because of Mormon missions. 




 I know a lot of guys that age that buy it. It's health conscious people who don't normally drink soda, but want to mix drinks.  Can't mix rum with water. In the words of my friend who tried "It retains none of the flavor and all of the what the fuck". 




 One of the things KLM said that I feel needs to be clarified is that Tommy wasn't getting booed last year when he came into games. There were boos, yes, but those were at Kelly, for what was perceived as giving up on Golson. We'd just seen Dayne Crist removed after a half the year before, we wanted Kelly to give someone else a shot. Tommy Rees for the last 2 years felt like a crutch for Kelly. A nice safe QB that can get 7-9 wins on a decent team. Those aren't the seasons we play for though. As a student body, at least, there's been nothing but respect for Tommy Rees. Do people wish we had a better QB, absolutely, but that doesn't take away anything that he accomplishes. He's part of the ND family, and nothing's going to change that. 




 You guys should just do tradesies with USC. 




 I think the ACC is better fit. We don't want to be on such an extreme end of any votes that come down to private vs public universities. The ACC is almost tied depending on how you want to count Pitt. And academically they're pretty similar. Yes we like playing UM, MSU, and Purdue from the B1G, but the ACC does have BC, Miami, and Pitt. I also feel like for nonfootball sports it's at least a toss up, if not leaning toward the ACC. We do love our lax. 




 I was under the impression from watching the game on Saturday that Rees was basically Peyton Manning and Bell was Roethlisberger. 




 He's not a comedian, but Mike Tomlin looks like Omar Epps. 




 Honestly the best part is just not wondering how I'm being insulted in a language I don't understand. 




 I stopped playing for about a year. Latin America servers were easily the best addition when I came back. 




 Shit, I was hoping for a nice easy win. 
























 7 Heismans, 6 winners. Archie Griffin won 2. 




 OSU only has 6 winners, though.  




 [Jizz Everywhere](http://imgur.com/krQK4Av) 




 ND has plenty of attractive women. They're in the college of business. 




 I'd put Purdue up there. I see way more from my Purdue friends about IU losing than I ever do about Purdue winning. I'm half convinced that being a Purdue fan really only means rooting against IU at all times. 




 I'm holding out hope he plays for us. We're collecting famous people's children. 




 Yeah that was 93. 89 we would have won if the best loss logic they used in 93 were used.  




 We should have won in either 89 or 93. 




 I've never seen as many dirty blocks by one team as I have by the Niumatalolo led Navy teams. And I understand how the academies have to play, I don't have anything against that. It makes me prefer we didn't play them, but I don't hold it against them. My issue is that it seems like every year there's at least 1-2 plays like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcTaRThg2mQ). 




 Am I allowed to hate their coach? 




 Gary Gray was great his junior year. He was the only one on that team that could tackle. That one admittedly horrendous game against Michigan killed him. 




 Ah yes, the many different business trades. Who wants to actually make money though, that's for tools. 




 Can confirm this one. 




 We have a similar issue.... 




 What kind of 5 year old's favorite movie was Gremlins? That shit would have terrified me as a 5 year old. 




 I was, I graduated with him in May, he was a pretty good friend of mine. He's off in Denver working now, still trying to make music, though, so hopefully that comes through for him. Great guy. 




 All the time he lived next door to me. 




 Love D. Montayne. 




 Don't forget all the meth. 




 What are the chances of winning the lottery and dying the next day? 




 But Beiber clearly never would have been famous in 1993. That was when people had taste. 




 Nixon was a pretty solid president except for that whole Watergate thing. He'd also be a filthy Hollywood liberal by today's standards. 




 "It's really catchy, but I don't understand how it got so big." 




 Thank god for a real reply. The reason this song got big was the video though. A quirky video like that can go a long way towards making a song big. Same reasoning that helped Here It Goes Again. 




 When I first started playing on Xbox Live, all I could think was wow I didn't realize so many girls were playing Left 4 Dead. After about 10 minutes I realized they were all little kids. 




 With current technology, who's still worried about missing a show? 10 years ago I'd understand, but we have dvr and Hulu. No reason to skip out unless it's something live (sports being the only reason I have cable really). 




 This is definitely great for us, I just wouldn't have picked GAIII as someone who would be declaring. On the other hand, like Darius Walker, he's clearly not going to improve his stock by staying. 




 Basically it's better to have something that even might be slightly embarrassing than look like you're hiding something worse. 




 Caps Lock and Shift like a normal sentence. 




 Same with mine, but I was in a really liberal college town. By senior year more people didn't say it than did. 




 I think to actually beat out Stop Girl she'd need 3. Stop Girl has at least 2 subs. 




 He's a business, man. 




 They also need to stop asking questions like "Did you resolve to catch 'em all?" when clearly everyone will respond with "I can't, put out bank" 




 Fucking same siders. 




 For home games we get the visiting teams' refs. Away games we have our conference for non football sports' refs. 




 I still don't understand how that escalated. People seemed to be getting upset out of the blue. 




 Pauly D and Vinny were awesome and both seemed really chill. 




 For that matter, he has 47 million followers on twitter. 




 No one in the media should be calling out college kids. Just not classy. Professional athletes are paid and it comes with the gig, college athletes aren't. And if anyone shouldn't, it's Doug Gottlieb about anyone at Notre Dame. 




 Since when do we play well in the Garden? 




 Catholic schools. 




 I was once in line getting my picture taken for a student id. There were Asians in front of me taking pictures of getting their picture taken. 




 They've talked it to death for 4 years now, there's only so much left to say. 




 The Land of BMWs! 




 #HASHTAGSWAGOVERLOAD 




 He's actually having a pretty good year. Not lighting it up, but he's an ILB, so not a position where you make a ton of plays. 




 I thought the point was that it's delicious. 




 I have friends in their 20s who routinely share articles from the Daily Currant, only to delete them from Facebook every time they're told it's satire. I'm not sure if they actually read them or not. 




 I wouldn't wish Ty on anyone. Except maybe USC. They hired the wrong UW coach. 




 I'd prefer it be like the Bachelor. They can give out yellow roses. 




 Shit the Pasquerillas just donate all kinds of buildings. I think we're up to 3 named after them on campus. 




 Hey we just got our first Saint. We're on our way to getting a Pope. 




 How is that any different from your schedule only being as good as Auburn, LSU, TAMU, UT? 




 In fairness, last year was also just a weird year for QBs in the draft. There were a lot of QBs that were all relatively close in talent, meaning no one had to prioritize getting one early. Some years being the 4th QB taken keeps you at least late 1st early 2nd. 




 I've always wanted to start off all my sentences with "I'm not racist, but" and then just say whatever I'm going to say. 




 [Baseball actually has much more parity than the NFL, in spite of the salary cap.](http://espn.go.com/mlb/blog/_/name/stark_jayson/id/8908029/mlb-more-parity-nfl) I won't try to make a direct comparison in terms of teams making the playoffs with the NBA, because it's too hard to compare a league where over half the teams make the playoffs, but 12 of the last 15 championships have been won by the Spurs, Lakers and Heat, with the 3 that weren't still having one of those 3 teams making the finals. The Heat also beat the Spurs in the finals last year, so it had 2 of those teams. The 15 years prior to that only had 5 different champions, which brings us to the beginning of the NBA's salary cap era. We've actually only had 7 champions in the 30 years of a salary cap. In comparison, MLB has had 19 in that same time span. 




 In fairness, tuition also has a lot more it has to pay for as well. In 1938, you had to pay for basically teachers, chalkboards, a few administrators, and people to take care of grounds and buildings. Now, you have to pay for all the technology, which also means you have to pay all the people take care of the technology. Not to mention all the other amenities that most colleges have now like gyms, more extensive health centers, higher quality food and housing, etc that costs more. Yes tuition is rising at an extremely high rate. But so is the cost of what is being provided for students. 




 Only in the northern half of the state, unfortunately. I miss Meijer. Something I'm excited to have back when I move to Ohio in a few weeks. 




 He can just keep replacing Championship winning coaches. 




 If he wants to coach in 2015, too, that'd be ok. 




 Unfortunately I don't have access to the data on that, it's just something people in admissions have told me. And I know not all athletes are football players, I was just trying to say they don't let anyone in, even athletes, that they don't think can handle the school academically. 




 I was a business major at ND, so I had classes with a good amount of football players as well as other athletes. Some athletes may not have necessarily been as smart as other people in the class, but I never felt like they weren't smart enough to be in the class. Yes, many athletes get some help with admissions, but they aren't going to admit anyone who can't handle classes. Also, just as an aside, legacies at ND do worse academically than athletes do. 




 He was already redshirted, so he'll be a RS Junior. We don't actually call people RS anything at ND, but given that he also missed a semester of school, I'm not 100% sure what they'll call him. 




 I've never seen a better description. 




 I wouldn't put us as a top 3 job. The tradition is great, and depending on the recruit and/or their parents, the quality of education can be a huge boon. On the other hand, for a school with as much success as we've had, there's a lot of recruits we can't even attempt to go after, because they won't be able to get in. Not only that, we don't have any "athlete majors" where athletes can slack off and do nothing. Combine that with needing to recruit much more nationally, I still think it's a great job, probably top 10 or so, but not top 3 by any stretch. 




 I was hoping he'd at least go coach somewhere he wouldn't have to keep playing Navy. 




 Saban to head up the Longhorn Network? 




 I had someone once ask me where our CDs were. I told them we'd stopped carrying them a few years earlier. I was told I was wrong and should look in back, apparently for our entire CD display. 




 Am I under arrest or should I guess some mo? 




 We beat USC, too! 




 My favorite part of that was "Your'e still scared of terrorists on planes". 




 Tommy Rees, the man who kept Michigan State out of the MNC. 




 I prefer thunderstruck. 




 Funerals that are celebrations of the person's life are the best kind. 




 Hufflepuffs are particularly good finders. 




 He also bases his opinions on some form of reality as opposed to Skip. 




 This. You can't start a negotiation by starting asking for what you actually want. You have to give the other person room to get you to come down so they feel good about it, too. 




 He still puts out great music. 




 I could have sworn Usher did it, but looking now I guess he only had 4. 




 We just need to show coaching candidates the finer parts of South Bend. Fever and Backer trips are a must. If 23 were still open that'd be the deal closer. 




 Brian Kelly wouldn't know how to exploit a weakness in a defense if he found one, though. Unless that weakness happens to be their pass defense. 




 This is how I felt about Charlie Weis 4 years ago. 




 Who decides what's officially a song? Is there some committee I wasn't aware of who listens to things and decides what is and isn't a song? 




 They're already coming up with [ways to fix that](http://myfit.co/). 




 We actually compete in robot football. http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82a5defa/article/notre-dame-wins-inaugural-robot-football-game 




 Girls still wear dresses and knee socks. Someone's clearly never seen Halloween. 




 What the hell kind of high school only lets gym classes play sports 1-2 days a week? I thought that's what you did in gym. 




 On the other hand we have freshmen rushing the field after a god damn 3OT win over Pitt that we needed a miracle to pull off. 




 I was bored and did something similar once. Finding West Virginia Wesleyan's schedule from 100 years ago is a bitch. 




 Tennessee might finally get to sing Rocky Top all night long after beating Florida! Lane didn't lie when he said he'd make  sure it would happen. 




 They spent more fucking time talking about her than the game. It was awful. 




 It's how I've purchased all my games so far. And it fit my purchase history perfectly. Right all the way. 




 Red Gatorade and Jack, however, do not work well together, despite being sugar, sour and liquor. My freshman roommate learned this the hard way. 




 For a second I though it was McDonald's orders over $30, and was horrified. 




 And honestly, if you're Bryce Petty, do you really want to go there when Tyler Bray is going to be the same year as you? 




 Aside from all of our suspects being 6' tall white males with brown hair wearing grey hoodies, like everyone on campus, we had some great crimes (should be noted we have single sex dorms).

Guy was going through a girl's closet at 4 in the morning wearing nothing but a blue shirt.

A guy was exposing himself while on a bicycle, the logistics of which both confuse and impress me to this day.

Two girls woke up in the middle of the night to see a man in their dorm room. Upon them waking up, he left out the window. This was further explained to me by someone in their dorm, who told me they lived on the 2nd or 3rd floor. Apparently it went about 12 hours before it was reported, because they both assumed it was a dream. 




 I'm always the person that when I ask someone how they're doing gets the non small talk answer. Inevitably the person who I've met twice will tell me it's not going well and then tell me exactly why. 




 But it was mostly attended by Irish Catholics. 




 I feel like targeting is going to encourage offensive players to lower their head so they can take a hit there and get someone ejected before too long. 




 He gives me PTSD. One of far too many QBs that Willingham or Weis made look like a damn Heisman candidate.
