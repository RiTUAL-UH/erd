 yes but those movies are shit  




 also has the same actor on there  




 The Walrus fight from Tusk  




 that was probably the most shocking thing I have ever seen in a theater oh man those screams tho and the brief glimpses before we were given our first look.  




 Oh well your loss  




 Yeah its more comedy than horror but there are some truely terrifying and creepy moments.  




 Yeah even when they showed the little glimpses and his horrible screaming I was like WTFFF.  




 Yeah I noticed the fake CGI right away and just thought it was someones cool new video but then they said it was supposed to be real so I was like oh.  




 Holy hell how did I not notice that!!!!!  




 LOL  




 HAHA they make a joke about that in the film  




 AMEN  




 See it in the film itself the buildup and reveal is so messed up I cringed when I first saw it.  




 Hes not TOO obvious tho most people might recognize his voice and eyes but thats it. He was freakin hilarious in it LOL  




 Just saw it wow WTF was that LOL so funny and terrifying at the same time I LOVED it cant wait to see it again!!!!! That walrus was scary looking LOL and Johnny Depp oh man was he great in this!!!!!  




 OMG yes I cringed when I first saw it and I rarely do that with movies.  




 Then watch it and have it explained for you  




 Because they r awesome!!!!!!!  




 LOVE that scene!!!!!  




 WOW I did not know that.  




 Thats what caused me to start the thread LOL  




 What are some movies that are an actors last film appearance ever and in their last scene they die in it??  




 Boring, artsy, and not enough Hulk.  




 sounds cool.  




 Avatar  




 Looks pretty good cant wait to see it also hope it gets some award recognition.  




 she didnt want to reprise a role that she earned a razzie for LOL.  




 Yeah she would have been apart of one of the biggest grossing movies ever. She chose to do mad whatever tho.  




 It was a good movie I kinda got confused at some parts but I loved tom and james performance RIP BTW. It was a good crime drama.  




 GOD YES THIS BETTER BE TRUE!!!!!!!!!  




 What is the origin of this term??  




 Just keep reminding yourself that it is NOT real just a movie with actors and a director.  




 Memento the first time I saw that movie I was blown away now everytime I rewatch it while still good it lacks the shock factor or whatever.  




 Not a good way to phrase it LOL but if she likes those kind of movies than why not!!!!  




 Hellboy 3  




 Yeah thats what I was thinking it would explain a lot.  




 Interesting theory how have I not noticed this yet.  




 They should just have a renner damon teamup movie.  




 Ah man I was gonna say that one, but yeah thats true.  




 Daniel day Lewis in Lincoln to me that was just WOW how he recited all of those monologues and stories while still doing a perfect lincoln accent so awesome.  




 Yeah but most of it is based on other unknown facts that I am not familiar with like if it bombs he will have lost a lot of money.  




 maybe  




 Yeah thats what I was thinking I also read somewhere that frank the rabbit was sent by some invisible gods or something to fix the timeline.  




 I Am Legend  




 now that is a good one I remember downloading the script and reading some of it it was genius. Too bad it will likely never be made be nice to see stallone behind the camera only and to see him do a pure drama biopic.  




 I love that movie!!!!  




 Yeah thats what I think too so a brooklyn accent.  




 I always wanted to use one of those but I never did.  




 Like what are some things that seem perfect for someone but will likely never happen because of one person being a jerk ie Steven Seagal is perfect for the expendables franchise but will never appear because of his beef with avi lerner.  




 I cannot stand hardcore girlie movies like the sisterhood of the pants or the yaya sisterhood. Also directtodvd kids movies. Anything else tho I generally like oh yeah except crappy b movies like the ones steven seagal does nowadays.  




 Yeah I love that movie I remember how scared I was when I first saw it.  




 Yes  




 Dam she has an oscar I forgot and she hasnt put it to good use yet either.  




 Ig u havent seen Ghostbusters then it would be an amazing experience to watch it in the theater brand new!!!!  




 Its all about the benjamins for him, it is really sad cuz I think he does great in drama and he should do it more but all he does is shitty comedies all the time.  




 Daniel Day Lewis as Lincoln in the movie Lincoln also Heath Ledger in the Dark Knight.  




 I would feel like a horrible person. 




 yeah that one  




 that movie that Marion Cotillard won an oscar for.  




 that one doesnt count cuz the thread is about heroes and villains who only meet once.  




 good one  




 Yeah that POS was released in theaters.  




 Man i wish that had a sequel just to see Sinestro as a villain anyways.  




 Yeah I love snowpiercer and why did I just realize that one?? Interesting.  




 Movies where the hero or protagonist only meets the villain once in the entire film.  




 Who would be cool in a film version of the book carte blanche?? Just for fun.  




 What are some perfect film collaborations that never happened??  




 UGG I HATE it when he drinks, it is SOOOO annoying!!!!!!  




 Like I will move either my leg or arms for something and they will make a creek sound, kinda like a floorboard. Why does it do that??  




 My BMI is 31 and I weigh 244 Lbs I want to get my BMI down to a healthy weight which is 184 so I want to lose 60 pounds at least. How can I do this without getting dangerous I dont care about the time either.  




 like regular actors who donet usually do comedy but r actually very good at it, like van damme on welcome to the jungle.  




 Go the hell to bed now!!!!! You have literally been sitting there for 13 freakin hours!!!! Give someone else a shot on the tv now!!!!  




 When you are expected to do something do it!!!!!! Dont just blow it off and ruin someone elses whole day do what is expected of you and also get off the dam couch for at least 30 minutes!!!!! God I HATE people who do that!!!!!  




 I sleep 8 or 9 hours a night band I am 22 years old but why do I yawn all day everyday??? Is there something else?? I wont feel tired at all but I still yawn.  









 I just mean actors not actresses because we all know what they did to get famous LOL, Like just guys who have no acting skills or anything but still get roles for no reason.  




 Its my soda god damit go get your own!!!!!! I only have a little and it is for ME noone else!!!!! Jesus christ if it was yours I would have said it is mine and yours, I dont care if you raised me it is MINE.  




 UGH I HATE when people randomly drink my god dam soda like they dont even care!!!!! I am on a budget and I cant afford to keep buying them damit if it isnt yours dont touch it!!!!!!  




 So I live with my dad and me and him were never really close I am more close to my mom and sister but I live with him because he lives close to where i work and I dont have enough money to get my own place yet. Anyways it is a one bedroom apartment and he sleeps in a bed and I sleep on an old military cot we both take turns on the tv and stuff but sometimes I wish I just had my own space!!!!! He is also kind of an ass sometimes, earlier today he assumed I was gonna go stay with my mom and sister for the weekend and I didnt correct him, then when he got home that evening he said "I thought u were gonna go with them" Then I responded " I never said that" He responds with "yes you did" UGH I HATE when people put words in my mouth that is one of my pet peeves!!!!! GOD I need my own place again!!!!! When I leave I will never call or visit him again that is the truth.  




 I have always wondered how do they know which bullets came out of what kind of gun???  




 I mean something along the lines of Daniel Day Lewis when he played Bill The Butcher who hated Abe Lincoln but eventually went on to play him, stuff like that.  




 I recently realized that I have crooked ears by almost a thumbs width. Why did this happen to me??  




 Whenever I hear the term inflation like for how much a movie has grossed and stuff I always wonder what it is???  




 Wat r some good ones where someone is first billed but they have very little screentime??? 




 I remember watching an episode of johnny bravo where he finds something and there is the sound of a choir and you think it is in his head but it actually was a choir singing behind him and he tells them to cut it out cuz that is annoying. Anyone know which episode that is???  




 A long time ago I remember watching this movie with my parents about a group or guys who defend a fort or something in the middle of the desert there was the main guy who may or may not have been played b Jean Claude Van Damme. There was also a black guy who gets captured by the enemy and a guy who gets an eyepatch over the course of the movie. At the end of the major battle it is just the main guy and the eypatch guy left, that is all I remember. Anyone know???  




 Like do u always get snacks if so what?? Also is there a favorite place u like to sit in the theater??? For me I always get snacks usually just popcorn and a drink but for longer movies I get candy too which I usually sneak in LOL. I also like to sit in the middle of the theater that way I dont have to crane my head.  




 What kind of film career would he have had?? God I wish he had lived I assume he would have been in The Expendables at some point.  




 I have always wondered what does having a mortgage mean???  




 What are some uncredited roles that are more than a cameo I mean a full fledged supporting role that was never credited for some reason.  




 Also what do u feel when u get scared, or startled??  




 Basically she is a few years younger than me and we used to go to the same high school and we r facebook friends and I really want to ask her out, but I dont know how I never see her around town and I dont want to ask over FB that sounds lame, I did look her up in the phonebook and I know her address and home phone number but I dont want to use those as it would be too stalkerish. What should I do???  









 What are some good ones???  




 I know an author gets an advance or something with a publisher but exactly how does this work??  









 I remember seeing a foreign commercial with all of the horror icons and stuff just outside doing normal things. Like Freddy Krueger, Michael, and Jason although I forgot what they were doing but I do remember Chucky was on a pogo stick bouncing around. It was all in live action.  




 I am considering reading 2 hp books at the same time. I am reading HBP but I also want to read GOF. I am just wondering if I should or not. Has anyone ever done this before?? LOL 




 I am just curious what other actors would u guys have seen in other roles. I for one think Bob Hoskins would have made a fine Horace SLughorn. Any other ideas??  




 A long time ago I watched the ending of a movie which had Men in Black as villains, I mean they were also aliens but they had big alien eyes that they would hide with sunglasses and they had white blood I believe. I also remember a bunch of the men in black attacked a house at night and tried to kill people.  




 Im sure this has been asked for but what if Tim Burton and Michael Keaton had returned for Batman 3 I think it would have been pretty amazing actually. I liked the first 2 and It is sad that they only made 2, thoughts???  




 A few years ago I walked in on my friend watching netflix and he was watching some movie that I have no idea was but it seemed intriguing. It was the very end of the movie and a prisoner got a letter in a jail cell and as he read the letter with a voiceover of the kid who wrote the letter, he was poisoned or something and the guy just dies there in his cell with some kind of poison that was on the letter I believe.  




 When I was younger I used to watch this anime show about some guy named Tenchi I believe he lived in the forest with a bunch of girls and one of them was nemed reoko or something like that. I remember he would fight people with a sword too.  




 To me some of the worst movie lines ever have to be on Taken 2 "look a flip flop" or "I just shot some guy". Another one was After Earth "my suit is black I like it but I dont know what it means". What are some others???  




 title  




 Like a relative or something.  




 Like a movie where there is no actually villain or antagonist for the heroes to fight it is just them against the clock or something like Inception.  




 I know there is Nicky in The Bourne Ultimatum and Angel in XMen First Class but r there any other ones where there is a character who doesnt talk after like halfway into the movie??  









 Like when a british person is playing an american and in the movie they "pretend" to be british and then revert to their real life accent. Any other country would work too like Australian, or Irish or german.  




 Every time I try to use Hola unblocker to watch netflix it takes me to the page but it never fully loads. Does this happen to anyone else?? Also what is another program that does the same thing as Hola???   
























 Hes retired  




 It was a movie about a guy who lost his family in a car crash and the girl who killed them a drama story basically, it could have been its own movie without the Other Earth storyline.  




 Yeah I mean it was a good movie I liked it but just seems like a huge wasted opportunity.  




 Yeah the first one was stupid but I did like the AVP fight scene thats about it. The second was a little better but not that much.  




 Another Earth  




 Its pretty good cant wait to see what the rest of the season brings!!!!!!  




 Yeah she is now the new Jennifer Lawrence and Shailene Woodley.  




 She was a little underrated before both this and Jack Reacher made her a little bigger. Hopefully she gets some well deserved recognition for this one!!! Might I also mention that she was very sexy in GG too.  




 Yes she was really good in it I am hoping this movie raises her profile more.  




 I dont think neither won its left deliberately ambiguis.  




 I watched a trailer for this movie with Haley Joel Osment called Home of the Giants and it literally gave away the entire movie. I felt bad now after watching the trailer first from that point on I never do that.  




 Maybe  




 I liked it, it was Homeland I like how they have a new start with new storylines and stuff. Just what this show needs.  




 Whenever I have an argument or someone has wronged me I usually imagine myself getting revenge on the person often in horrific ways. Example I was fired a few months ago and the boss was so unforgiving about it he is an ass and sometimes I imagine myself returning to work there and taking him out. the same with my dad I dont like him that mush and I imagine making him pay. Just thought I would put that to writing.  




 I also remember a movie with Robert Redford and Willem dafoe called The clearing that is rated R for literally 1 F bomb.  




 As well as some graphic nudity.  




 I Love You Phillip Morris.  




 Lost in Translation is rated R for one brief scene of nudity but I have seen other pg13 movies with more nudity than that that didnt get R.  




 jax doesnt know that he was high when he said it plus he doesnt really have a good track record with the club.  




 I wish he had killed Lin and all of his guys that way he can be done with this pointless vendetta.  




 thats what I was thinking and I hope that that happens.  




 Me too what scares me the most about that is that it can actually happen that thought just gives me the shivers.   




 I just used my fist to break my fall that was it.  




 Just leave dude dont let your life get any worse.  




 Yeah true.  




 Its entertaining, thats about it.  




 I dot have a job ATM so whenever I somehow scrape together some cash and I am a little short I go into my dads room and grab a few quarters. Over the past year it must have equaled 20 dollars. I kinda feel bad but not really cuz he is an asshole.  




 Jesus FUCKING CHRIST!!!!!!! I didnt mean to hit you it was an accident I tripped and hit you on the back with my fist it was a complete accident you did not need to act like i actually hit you for no reason because I didnt!!!!! And you made me look like a fool in front of my fucking MOTHER!!!!!!! You are a piece of shit I always hated you!!!!!! You dont know what an accident is or use common sense like I was trying to explain to you, you just started yelling at me for no fucking reason!!!!! You are a piece of shit and I officially hate you now.  




 Mike Myers - The Love guru  




 Charlie Wilson is indirectly responsible for 9/11.  




 it took WAY to long to come out and it just wasnt as good as its predecessor.  




 Yes  




 Never seen it.  




 Good one  




 What are some good ones???  




 Best Actress fo sho if she gets a nom tho.  




 Yes she probably went to China for a few years in the universe anyways.  




 I used to get Abbie Cornish and Katherine Heigl confused 
 




 Christopher Meloni and Elias Koteas  




 YES!!!!!!!!!!!  




 Also because of all the nudity and stuff plus I thought anything Gay related automatically got an R Rating.  




 Joe Dirts dad  




 I always wondered why Chuck and Larry is Rated PG13 it seems R Rated to me.  




 LOVED it it was an exact adaptation of the book also loved the performances especially Rosamund Pike she was so DAM SEXY in that movie!!!!!!  




 Yes he is a good actor and one of my favorites I wish he would become an A Lister again. He just needs the right role I guess.  




 Exactly.  




 I didnt like it at all I wish at least one of them died or something. Cant wait to see the movie tho!!!!!  




 Fina-Freakin-LY  




 Bale  




 let the Harry Potter jokes begin!!!!!  




 Breaking Bad  




 They r all about the same but my personal favorite out of the 3 is Phoenix he is so good in all of his roles.  




 Tusk and I want my mind erased of everything I knew about the movie beforehand too so I could watch it blind.  




 yes I will.  




 LOVED IT!!!!! A bit disturbing at some parts but still funny and weird all at the same time.  




 Yes  




 halloween the original.  




 Interesting  




 Yeah I am, almost done with the book just like 80 pages left and stuff.  




 K I got some reading to do then but first i have to finish Gone Girl in time for Friday LOL.  




 Oh alright im gonna keep going I think I heard Brans storyline doesnt add up in the books and tv show anyways.  




 Yes thats why they became decepticons they r basically Megatrons Children.  




 Alright cool I will keep reading then, its just so long and I already know whats gonna happen.  




 BOOOOOOOOOOOO  




 I am currently reading the Game of Thrones books and I am on book 2 a clash of kings but I am wondering if I should just skip ahead to book 4 because I have already seen the tv show and know what happens. what should I do??  




 I liked it a very realistic revenge film and well made to for a debut film.  




 cool  




 Gemmas secret not getting out.  




 Yeah I like seeing them at church now it doesnt really happen that much.  




 Wolverine 3 will come out a year later I believe.  




 All  




 Star Wars  




 Yes would love to see more of Davids adventures and what villains he would encounter.  




 Yeah he is a good actor wish he was in more movies that would challenge him tho instead of just playing Bruce Willis all the time.  




 Mostly cuz he is a part of a worldwide Cult but aside from that I like him he is a good actor and I have only seen him in a few bad movies.  




 Good  




 Did u miss Mel Gibson???  




 The Cabin in the Woods I thought it was gonna be another horror movie where everyone dies but I was pleasantly surprised now it is one of my favorite movies.  




 Furry Vengeance happened.  




 Why is there a picture of Godzilla???  




 i am a student studying something else now and i am currently looking for a new job.  




 I went to film school for a year and a half.  




 I agree with everything u just typed I hope Dumb to will bring his career back and that he will become a leading man again it has been forever and yeah I dont think I will ever watch Mr Poppers Peguins even if he is in it. He is like my all time favorite actor.  




 Jim Carrey  




 Finally some good news about this project.  




 Yeah Jax will probably fuck him over and stab him in the back like he does to everyone.  




 Yeah Jax will probably fuck him over and stab him in the back like he does to everyone.  




 Oh yeah thats what I like.  




 It is awesome nothing can stop it now!!!! I am glad AOS is here that way I can get my weekly dose.  




 It could go either way I wouldnt mind seeing Marks be a badass again and actually killing someone.  




 So the club is now going to kill at least 3 people every episode now?? AWESOME!!!!!   




 Yes loved that part its good to see Marks threatening people again instead of being all goody goody.  




 Not really movie news plus that is Colin Farrell  




 Cant wait for the trailer!!!!  




 Not at all  




 Oh yes and IMO there has never been a more perfect time to play that song in a movie.  




 Thank you  




 Denzel Washington, Tom Hanks also Jim Carrey  




 Interesting theory how have I not thought of this already.  




 LOL  




 O okay well I am not religious even if I was I wouldnt care LOL.  




 I have always wanted to read the books and see what happens. I think I will now.  




 probably  









 Likely Juice before he is finally killed by Jax.  




 He was just misunderstood or something like that.  




 Jason Bateman NOOOO!!!!!!!!  




 Yeah that would have been cool.  




 YES!!!!!!!  




 Hobo With a Shotgun  




 Memento, The Dark Knight, Star Wars Episode III, and now Tusk  
























 Because Jim Carrey doesnt like sequels and just recently relented. 




 Paula Patton  




 Ah man im gonna miss it I actually liked it mostly for Karen.  




 Interesting very interesting I had no idea. Also know who ALbert Fish is and wow.  




 Yes hes a villain but not really if ya know wat I mean. Plus he tried to call it off too but was too late.  




 ???????  




 Yeah I kinda wish they had stayed with Evil Jigsaw in the sequels.  




 Is it just me or is Jigsaw on the original Saw a lot more cruel. In all the other movies he says he despises killing people yet Gordon is ordered to kill Adam and he also slashes Tapps throat. Its like he is much more of a psychopath in that one and all the others he seems like a vigilante.  




 Because he had money problems.  




 Okay cool thanks 




 I have always wondered.  




 OMG YES!!!!!!!!!  




 When is this movie coming out damit!!!!!  




 that would give me nightmares  




 maybe  




 Because they were just a waste it seemed like.  




 I will force it out of you. Okay so heres how it goes I understand that you gave birth to me and you care for me but dont freakin talk to me like you understand my life alright. Your such a freaking hypocrite also. I HATE when you drink it makes you into an obnoxious bitch I cant wait to get out of here and i will NEVER call you when I leave for the last time. Oh yeah one more thing when I give my opinion to you you tell me to leave but you have the right to tell me yours all the freaking time?? That makes no sense like at all.  




 My apologies  




 Now thats a working man.  




 I think you know  




 Thanks yeah she was I miss her so much now.  




 Do you just live to annoy me in the most subtle way??? Why is it you always do things that annoy me so much. Like when I want to be alone you come in and steal my solitude from me. Also you never do what is expected of you.  




 She died the other day I miss her so much already my beautiful Daisy I will miss taking her for walks.  




 They will hand it to some one who will be a puppet basically.  




 Jesus you watch The two Hobbit movies all the dam time its like the only movies you watch!!!! Why are you so obsessed with them??? This year alone you must have seen them both 5 times each whats so special about them?? I mean I like Hobbit and LOTR too but not that much. You always complain when you say I rewatch movies but your worse then me you freakin idiot.  




 That has happened to me 3 times for Dont be afraid of the dark, the raid 2, and recently Tusk. It is an awesome experience!!!!! U can text and switch seats as many times as u want to. When I saw The Raid 2 I sat in like 10 different seats.  




 Yeah its just too much.  




 Isnt it annoying when they announce a date for a movie trailer?? I mean we have already been waiting for some footage for months possibly even years dont make us wait longer just release the dam thing.  




 Yeah but probably not.  




 I always get there at least 15 minutes before the movie starts if its a new movie I get there earlier tho. I cannot watch a movie in the theater without a snack so I always get a popcorn and soda depending on the length sometimes candy too. I always sit in the middle so i dont have to crane my head or not. I ALWAYS put seasoning in my popcorn i have been for 3 years now let me think Caramel, Kettle Corn, and Ranch. I dont really eat or drink the snacks during the previews because I like to save it for the movie. I normally go to Harkins Theaters a local chain but sometimes I will go to AMC for a 5 dollar movie. Sometimes I go to a dollar theater too they have a special every tuesday movies for 1.50. Anyways those r my habits.    




 dam stupid marvel  




 His wife has only been in his movies I believe. She basically has no career except in his movies.  




 Yes those are the main 3.  




 Man that really bites.  




 $7 exactly sometimes 7.50 depending on the chain I go to, I usually always get in at matinee price during the evening because I have a student ID.  




 The Catcher in The Rye dam JD and his family so stubborn.  









 Good finale Good show gonna miss it.  




 Good finale I got annoyed with all the flashbacks tho still good poor nucky.  




 UGH I hate when this happens I mean it has prospect and it has Robin Wiliiams so its guaranteed to make money.  




 The Cabin in the Woods  




 I was just thinking of watching this show now  




 Unless its still playing in some theaters then u will have to wait til late november when some torrents hit.  




 All Halloween movies, All Friday the 13th movies, and all Nightmare on Elm Street movies.  




 I just realized that John Wick was released yesterday the same day that the show Constantine premiered on NBC. is that weird???  




 "When I arrive at my destination I am gonna Kill Bill"  




 Its the only time someone actually says Star Trek in Star Trek  




 One of my favorite scary kids movies ever!!!!  




 Its just sitting there noone is touching it sadly I really want to see them too.  




 I thought it was an okay movie good cast and good direction.  




 OOOH LOL!!!!!!!!  




 Okay I get it you are a homophobe you dont like Gays now please STOP saying everytime even the smallest mention of a gay person you criticize it. So annoying everytime I watch Modern Family you comment about Cam and Mitch its getting fucking old!!!! Im slowly starting to think you are in the closet like that guy on American Beauty.  




 WTF  




 Mr Marks doesnt like to be fucked by anyone excet Mrs Marks!!!!!!  




 Does he look like a Bitch!!!!!!  




 Ullysses Something.  




 AHHHH man I liked this show. Gonna miss it.  




 Interesting theory I wouldnt be surprised if it was the truth.  




 Yes great episode last night cant wait for the finale but I am gonna miss this great show.  




 Yes me too I hope it lives up to expectations.  




 He was a scottish sailor who made a deal with calypso to ferry souls who died at sea to the other side.  




 a rant  




 I thought we were friends in real life we had some good convos together but for some reason you refuse to add me??? I want to see what your life is like and you wont add me you suck!!!!  




 Yes you are.  




 Man I wish I can erase my mind and watch that movie again for the first time i was so blown away when I finally saw it.  




 aha sure  




 Harry Potter survived in Deathly Hallows because of the piece of Voldemort inside him he survived because he became the master of the Deathly Hallows.  




 Jack Nicholson and Quentin Tarantino  




 If its already filming why not release it next year?? It is a directtodvd and those dont cost too much.  




 Nice musical scene  




 Its just a limited release in the next few weeks it will get more.   




 OMG I hate the dam news you watch it every dam night!!!!! Sometimes multiple times a day and they just replay the same stories over and over!!!! When you miss just one of them you get annoyed well who cares. When I get my own place I will NEVER watch the news and when you visit and ask to watch it I will not let you!!!!!! I dont know why you are obsessed with that stupid show anyways.  




 What r some??  




 Cant wait to see wat they do to Juice.  




 Yeah im surprised he didnt tell Nero or Alvarez the man really wants to die.  




 Yes  




 Just say that he wasnt actually Spiderman by that time.  




 K I will probably just get new ones tho  




 They didnt really show him its weird. Would have loved to see him.  




 okay cool  




 So I was listening to my headphones today and the left side all of a sudden stopped working. I messed around with it a little bit but then I had to position the cord into a certain position just to hear it out of both sides. I dont want to get rid of them but what is wrong with them?? Can they be fixed cheaply??  




 LOL thanks  




 Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder  




 Oh god yes!!!!!  




 Yes just have them make the amazing spiderman movies intigrated into the mcu.  




 It came out in March  




 Like the shortest amount of time that a trailer was released between the film itself?? Was there ever one that was weeks before a movie opened??  




 The one where Lucille tells George Michael that Maebe "spent her inheritence getting here". I laughed when I first heard that scene.  









 Yeah so that means season 4 of Arrow will be Oliver in prison.  




 Yeah.................................yeah.  




 Thomas Jane  




 I think I found my new job LOL  




 Awesome thank you!!!!!!  




 Okay well thats not right  




 Yeah noone major wants to work with him its a shame cuz he is such a good actor.  




 Its sad that most of the former james bonds arent that big anymore.  




 HAHAH I remember that episode  




 OMFG dude wow!!!!!  




 He didnt like being a star so he only does smaller stuff nowadays.  




 Yeah shes nothing nowadays man she used to be the queen of the world.  




 He still makes stuff he had a few movies this last year.  




 Okay cool  




 o okay alright thanks love reacher  




 I mean there is an arc or something that follows a story 61 hours and worth dying for it says they have a story or something.  




 YES!!!!!!!  




 So I just got back from the library and the only reacher novel they had is A Wanted Man I looked it up and it said it is part of another storyline. Do I need to read the other books 61 hours and worth dying for in order to understand this one?? Id hate to have to take it back.  




 I think he just made a shit ton of money that he didnt think he could work again except for Rush Hour but I did like him in Silver Linings Playbook.  




 He says he is semi retired but he hasnt done a movie for like 4 years so lets just say he is retired.  




 He burned a lot of bridges and stuff and noone wants to work with him anymore. I dont think his career an be saved.  




 Joffrey and then Cersei.  
























 OMG EPIC  




 any steven seagal movie  




 I used to love those  




 o good choices you went old school  




 what did u end up watching???  




 Yes he definitely should have found out.  




 Yeah the one thing I like to think that Abel will one day seek out the Club and try to join them just like his father did.  




 Ive always thought she was an angel.  




 This  




 Jack Nicholson wish he had done The Judge.  




 He is still in movies but I agree he needs a major comeback something that makes him an ALister again.  




 Yeah shes the grim reaper or something.  




 Yes I would love to know what happens to the club afterwords, what kind of leader chibs will be.  




 RIP Jax  




 Yes it was cool!!!!  




 HAHAH I LOVE Honest Trailers!!!!!!  




 cool  




 Edward Norton he is a good actor and I love his movies but he is just a big control freak it seems.  




 LOL Yeah I rewmember laughing so hard when I first saw that.  




 Nice  




 Woody Allen  




 Thats what im thinking.  




 Saw, Fight Club, Usual Suspects, and of course Oldboy 2003  




 Yes finally this is going to happen!!!!!  




 Its because he loves it so much as it is the only connection he has to earth and his mom.  




 What in the flying fuck!!!!!!  




 God I have seen it so much it is scarred into my brain.  




 Yeah thats what I hate they both went out the way they wanted to they didnt suffer well juice did I guess but thats it. Jax should have killed Gemma the same way she killed Tara.  




 Yeah true and they were all killed by/because of Jax it is so fitting.  




 That would be awesome!!!!!!  




 Now that is a cast!!!!!!  




 Only the ones I see in theaters yes, it is a word document I use a different one every year.  




 Die Hard no other  




 good also I have heard that a movie called martyrs directed by paca laugher is pretty scary too I havent seen it yet but I want to.  




 The first VHS was pretty good you can try the second one too but dont bother with the crappy third one.  




 Duncan Jones would have been cool.  




 Man I wish I can rease all knowledge of Star Wars and rewatch them in release order just so I can be shocked at that part.  




 The Lovely Bones I have only seen it 6 times because I like to preserve the feeling I get when watching it.  




 ^^^^^^THIS  




 Looks pretty funny.  




 His last few movies have been crap but I sure hope Exodus and The Martian bring him back.  




 It looks pretty good I wish I had a time machine so I can watch it now!!!!!  




 wow you seem just like me  




 Cuba Gooding Jr by Far  




 O okay yeah I keep my ticket stubs too I have been 62 times this year.  




 To me that is the only one.  




 What is today Steve Zissou day??  




 yeah true I am a student too and I know how that feels but lots of times I will go to the movies anyways even if I will burn all of my money.  




 WOW u keep track to awesome!!!! Whats the most u have had in one month???  




 Every god dam day!!!! But Hellboy 3 will likely never happen.  




 wow I didnt know intermissions still happened. Also is your name Jack Sparrow LOL  




 U r my hero  




 Hes still alive?? cool Wish he would direct again.  




 How often does everyone go to the movies?? And whats your opinion on them. For me I try to go every weekend sometimes once a week if I am lucky cause for me seeing a movie in the theater is the best experience ever.  




 Why have I never thought of that before. Good one  




 OMG YES!!!!!  




 your a cop arent u 




 HMM i will look into that thank u.  




 well its true  




 because every time i have ever talked to one including last night they were all jerks to me. I asked one for directions once and he said "im not a map" and walked away from me.  




 They have computers there??  




 UGH my bike got stolen last night I am so pissed!!!!! I wish I could find the person who did that and give them a piece of my mind if ya know wat I mean. Stupid city. Also another thing I hate cops they r all assholes.  




 LOL  




 That is cool!!!!!!!!!  




 just do a google search and find a site that has them.  




 I loved that part!!!!! Shes a good singer.  




 I would have made it one 3 hour movie and little if any lotr connections, noone but the characters that were in the book. I would probably keep ian holm as bilbo but only bookend and narrarate it.  




 here here. 




 Hangover sequels and son of mask, also ace ventura jr and big mommas sequels.  




 I listened to that for 3 days straight LOL its not that much of a challenge.  




 God I hate that just release the trailer dont make us count down to it.  




 She will never do a comic book movie, she has had many chances to in the past.  




 Yes!!!!!!!!! and yes!!!!!!!!  




 no  




 Jessica Chastain I dont like her because I think she is overrated and her face is ugly.  




 I liked it too slow at some parts but still good. I liked that jump scare at the end.  




 I like the middle part of the theater it gives u the best spot so u dont have to crane your neck. Occasionally I will sit at the bottom for the leg room.  




 It used to be cool when it first started but now its just repetitive I guess.  




 Yes  




 thanks!!!!!  




 She wont be missed or maybe.  




 I asked he does.  




 ALright yeah I just decided if I just get a new screen then thats just 200 right there which I can fund with one paycheck then send it to my friend who fixes computers for a living im sure he can help with that.  




 My bad it is a macbook 2010 model and the repair would cost 400 altogether I am not rich at all. I could get a new windows for less than that. I just dont know which way to go.  




 So my Macbook broke the other day well it didnt break break just the display doesnt work anymore and so I am forced with a decision I could fix the mac and keep using it or I could just buy a new one a windows laptop. I do not want to lose the mac forever but at the same time the concept of having a new one is intriguing. What should I do???  




 Okay yeah im gonna try that as soon as i get home tonight  




 Okay hmm I wonder if i plug it into a tv through HDMI it will still show up and I can work on it like that.  




 It wasnt on the keyboard thank god it was on the back at the bottom and where the thing folds that black part in the back.  




 Okay so I was at school today and my water bottle accidently seeped onto my mac a little bit then when I started using it the screen started flickering and then the display turned off now it wont turn back on and the computer is still black. I made an appointment at the genius bar but first I need some opinions and help.  




 Shes still alive???
 




 Josh Brolin in GOTG  




 WOW cool I had no idea.  




 I like to think that he didnt exist until IB.  




 God I hate when they announce the trailer dates for movies just freakin release it.  




 Hello Natalie I am a big fan of yours I was wondering, what is your favorite role you have played like ever???  




 Awesome movie saw it awhile ago.  




 Doesnt look that good  




 I just noticed that every phone number has them now, why do we do that?? And when did it start???  




 Man my old roomates gf is obsessed with movies like this, caused a lot of heartbreak because she only liked "happy" movies.  




 Thats what I like about her tho.  




 Looks cool  




 Hes such a joke.  




 Theres another IMAX movie coming in a few weeks I believe. The Hobbit The Battle of Five Armies  




 OMG YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  




 Memento  




 God I just love that shot she looks so hot!!!!!  




 Wes Anderson is AWESOME so is Stop Motion!!!!!  




 LOL Yeah.  




 That seems about right  




 Chucky  





























 A few here and there but not every single year.  




 Most of his movies nowadays r shit but he is one of the biggest stars in the world and people pay to see his movies so theres that. Personally I think he should stop doing comedy and just start being in Dramas nowadays because he is really good at that but that will likely never happen.  




 I havent seen it but I wish David Ayelo got a nom for Selma.  




 Probably the stupidest "movie" I have ever seen in my life.  




 You expect me to watch Berlin!!!!  




 Most of the time the movies change things like certain plot points and stuff. So no its not if you want to know more about the world and stuff.  




 I kinda think he killed himself onstage and the last hospital scene is just a fantasy of his or something  




 Then why did he have conflicts with the director??? 




 God I hope Keaton or Carell wins for Best Actor.  




 God I wish they would just announce something already quit playing with my emotions!!!!  




 Yes and yes  




 I liked it and TBH I have no freakin idea if she is from the future or not.  




 YES!!!!!!!!!! I am already counting down the days.  




 Yes  




 Man that sucks for her LOL  




 WOW she should have said i wish I had a boyfriend  




 Christian Bale  




 you ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight???  




 yes he did but they died a long time ago  




 So Hitler could understand her.  




 I kinda think he died there on the stage by really shooting himself and the final hospital scene is just his final thoughts, notice how everything goes good for him in that scene.  




 Bitches you bitches!!!!!!!!  




 Well now you know!!!!!!!  




 Yeah it was good I loved it.  




 its decided then  




 How bout Bradley Cooper in there for Best Actor.  




 Should I watch this tomorrow or Inherent Vice???  




 The Norton one didnt make that much money so Marvel decided to give up on giving the character his own series.  




 The Wicker Man 2006  




 Sutter thinks thats who he is.  




 that was also a tribute to Opie I believe.  




 LOL  




 Unforgiven or The Good bad and ugly those are the two best westerns IMO.  




 yes it is.  




 well he said call him so just put two and two together.  




 Thats what I have always wondered too I mean he just left them in a room with a madman LOL.  




 It had his phone number on it.  




 No he wont be nominated even though he deserves it.  




 Yeah true Sutter kind of retconned some stuff, I wonder if in later years him and Piney grew apart and Clay and JT became best buds thats why TellerMorrow was formed.  




 That explains why my Netflix Canada site wasnt working last night.  




 Yeah true but for the shows that arent on netflix too like Community and South Park its better than going to some sketchy website and stuff.  




 Harkins theaters $7.25 all the time because I am a student. the normal price is $10.25 usually. At AMC its like $5.20 or something.  




 whoa I literally just watched that movie too!!!! 









 O okay I get it now. Thanks!!! 




 No  




 Yeah some not all of it tho.  




 Wolverine Origins is no longer canon Fox basically swept it under the rug.  




 Thank you  




 True I guess I just wanted Jax to live above all else rather than the typical main character is an antiherro so the final scene is him dying ending.  




 So I was wondering when JT died and Clay suceeded him as President was he already VP?? Why wasnt Piney VP since he was one of the cofounders and stuff. Just something I was wondering.  




 I kinda wanted to have it end with Jax getting away with the murders of Gemma, Unser, Marks, and Barofsky. Then he sends his kids away and still stays on as President just a broken man though who finally makes it legitimate.  




 Too late he has already done that.  




 Sylvester Stallone  




 Yes true  




 Thank you!!!!  




 Yes I saw that now IO dont have to use Hola unblocker to watch Community.  




 yeah true but who would ever pay 100 for ads   




 I like it so far except for the ads I already have Netflix too so I guess my entertainment needs r taken careof for a few months!!! I cant wait til my shows start coming on again in January so I can no longer download stuff and I can just stream them.  




 Yeah he didnt really leave them with a lot of plausible deniablility.  




 wow someone loves birdman  




 So what do yathink the club is up to now??? It is in good hands with Chibs as President but I wonder what kind of adventures they will have now that the teller family is gone basically.  




 LOL  




 Spiderman 3  




 alright Drax  




 its gay  




 I wish he would do another Tron but disney has its hands full with Star Wars and Marvel  




 Twilight because its Gay  




 Well I want it to be nominated but usually that means it wont get a nom.  




 Hes a really good actor hope he gets an Oscar some day.  




 Beat me to it.  




 After they refused to stream it exclusively in the first place??  




 I liked it it was really funny, maybe I should rewatch it havent seen it for awhile.  




 I LOVED IT!!!!!! So glad the terrorists didnt win and i got to watch this IN a Theater. Also Some guy had a seizure while watching it and we all got free movie tickets because of that.  




 ahhh sorry to hear that.  




 never  




 Yes  




 I believe I mean the battle of the five armies.  




 I have gotten into a few actually one was wether or not the cartoons and comic were in canon, one was who was better the jedi or the sith and another was darth maul vs darth vader.  




 Yes Star Wars  




 Good movie I loved it one of the few that made me cry.  




 From what I hear the directors cut is exactly 30 minutes longer.  




 Lots of them.  




 Interesting  




 Okay thanks dude guess I will see it on christmas day like I originally planned.  




 Because I want to.  




 In my theater it is there for at least a week.  




 So I really want to see the Interview on Opening Day there is a theater close to me that is showing it but I am still spooked by the terror threats, should I watch it opening day or wait a few days???  




 Why just why???  




 There was naked people??  




 Well whoever gave him the drink is a murderer!!!!!  




 Oklay that makes sense but wow 20.  




 20 movies?? Seriously???  




 Yeah true  




 O okay interesting.  




 do they charge you 99 flat?? or is it broken up into monthly payments??  




 Okay hmm I still havent decided but thanks!!!!!  




 no  




 So I already have Netflix but I was thinking of adding Amazon instant too just to see what the selection is like too, should I do it?? It might be worth it just to see all of the HBO shows too.  




 Cool  




 He was a terrorist.  




 This sucks balls  




 Man I was looking forward to a dangerous visit to the movie theater on Christmas Day. I hope you are Happy Cyber Hackers.  




 torrents although most of them can be found on youtube  




 Man I still listen to that song it is on my iphone!!!!  




 AHHH thats so nice, I wanna reread this book again now.  




 Yes completely agree.  




 13 Reasons Why it got me thinking how life is so precious and how people can come and go in your life.  




 Yes they could do some kind of crossover movie with marvels two teams that would be pretty cool actually.  




 LOL  




 What are some of the easiest paychecks for actors in movies???  
























 yeah that was sad, could have been a good franchise I dont understand why it bombed.  




 man that would have been awesome!!!!!  




 I think it was Abed alone.  




 Yeah I guess you right and WOW 2 billion dam.  




 I wish Marvel or Disney I should say broke out the checkbook and bought spiderman back for good. I mean its cool he will finally be in the MCU but Sony still has control how awesome would it be for Marvel to have the rights back forever.  




 if they never sold the rights then marvel probably wouldnt exist today.  




 Leto will own the role.  




 Theres really noone worse than Uwe Boll.  




 Probably not  




 because thats the only one I have seen.  




 Kingsman  




 I wish he made a few jokes or something or was in a sketch UGH. was he only there to please the fans???  




 I wanted Wolverine to win.  




 Absofuckinglutely!!!!!!  




 Keaton duh  




 I will harvest that planet tomorrow before I let her take it from me  




 A good performance by Arnie and a few good action scenes but other than that its crap. I couldnt tell if itwas trying to be comedy or thriller sometimes, still worth a watch tho.  




 LOL  




 Awesome movie!!!!! Im gonna see it again!!!!!!  




 LOL  




 I thought this was a creepy post LOL.  




 I know he was only there for five minutes and is played by eric forman of all people but I did like Venom, I wish he was the main villain though.  




 Awesome!!!!!!!  




 Yes he would be good.  




 God its so exciting seeing all of this!!!!!  




 John Mcclane  




 Lion King  




 Heath Ledger  




 Yes  




 YES!!!!!!! its so exciting seeng Spidey come home I hope they can make him have a major role in the civil war film that would be epic!!!!!  




 Logan Lerman or Dylan Obrien  




 I wish they would rewrite the movie to include Spiderman in the major role he has in the comics that would be so cool!!!!!  




 No  




 Movies are meant to be seen without interruptions.  




 Yes thats the reason i go to the theaters so much even watching movies multiple times.  




 Every dam time.  




 I wouldnt mind a sequel but the director is busy it seems.  




 No this is print we dont air Speculation.  




 no  




 Oh god just make it stay dead please.  




 Okay they are just lazy then.  




 they kind of gave up on it because the first one didnt meet their expectations, personally I hope they make it work soon.  




 cool LOL never noticed that before.  




 Did Eddie Redmayne remind anyone else of Pollux troy???  




 its the reason they delayed the movie.  




 lets hope its true.  




 Yes hes an awesome director I think if he focused solely on that it would be cool.  




 Cool  




 Yes I hope thats what Afflecks future is.  




 I didnt think he directed. He would be a good one actually.  




 LOL  




 Good movie I havent seen it for about 10 years now maybe I should revisit it.  




 Which ones do you think should pull a Clint as in Just start directing movies from now on and also act in them??? Personally I think Mel Giobson and Kevin Costner should do that they are both great directors and arent really getting good roles nowadays. Thoughts???  




 OMG that seems horrible!!! Thank god I have never had an experience like that there were a few loud guys yes but not like that. I still go to the movies all the time and I LOVE IT!!!!! Its a shame that people like that still roam around in them.  




 rofl  




 Yes  




 Shes hot.  




 No not the bees!!!!!  




 Yes thats what I was thinking those r considered the Golden Age of cinema.  




 Gibson is an awesome director hope he directs again soon!!!!  




 Sylvester Stallone tried to make a movie about him a few years ago but the studio cancelled it or something and he made expendables instead I read the script and thought it would make a good movie.  




 his gun and badge from when he was a cop.  




 Thats about right.  




 Cool 




 theres something I really didnt know 




 Yes  




 Yes watched it the other night great movie wish i had seen it sooner too.  




 Is it actually confirmed that they will be in the same universe???  




 Jennifer lawrence, Anne hathaway, Rosamund Pike, Zooey Deschanel, Emma Stone, Shaileme Woodley, Brie Larsen, Alison Brie, Karen Gillan,Hayley Atwell, and of course Anna kendrick  




 Yes he should.  




 Yeah its mostly with b movies man there is one i saw once where it is glaringly obvious LOL.  




 Thats for an actual scene in the movie In the movie a documentary crew was filming the reunion between the mom dad and son.  




 The Fault in Our Stars  




 I will read it wish it was being written by the master himself though. 




 WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!  




 Yes I wish they would make one already but disney has bigger fish to fry I guess.  




 Because they want to take away the shock factor of it. I also found it annoying how they announced them all the time.  




 NICE!!!!!!!!  




 I just saw it to man what a good movie.  




 Cool  




 Yes but who could play him????  




 Yeah true they could go with an older spiderman in the MCU if it ever happens though.  




 I forgot that scene I must rewatch it I guess.  




 marvel has already said IF they get Spidey the role will be recst, thats the one drawback I see if marvel gets the rights.  




 true
 hope its real tho 




 Star wars and Back to the future also Lord of the rings.  




 I liked Lone Survivor a little better because of all the action and stuff. Fun fact the main characters of both movies Chris Kyle and Marcus Luttrell were friends in real life, man what if they had tied the movies in somehow.  




 Id make The Mandarin the villain he was supposed top be. Just have Killian be the brain guy and have Ben Kingsleys character do everything including kill maya and fight with tony at the end. Also his plan is to start a world war by making it look like the president was killed by some other country or something.  




 AMEN Germany AMEN  




 OMG dude  




 All of em.  




 I just saw it and I enjoyed it a good little comedy tho like all comedies of course they showed all of the funny parts in the trailer.  




 After everyone and their mom has seen it.  




 Michales Proposal to Holly in The Office  




 I really wish that they had gotten the rights back for Spiderman how awesome would it have been to see Spiderman, captain America, and Iron Man all in the same movie. I hope this Infinity war rumor is true now that would be something.  




 HMM Ill check it out.  




 Who knows???? 
 




 Not atm, sad too I wish they would hurry up I want to see Rooney mara as Lisbeth again.  




 I need new audiobooks for work what are some good suspenseful ones???  









 LOL  




 It was an okay season better than coven at least but not as good as the first two, I was just happy that when someone died they STAYED dead this time. Also Evan peters got someone pregnant again LOL.  




 LOL YES!!!!!!!  




 Because shes russian.  




 WOW that is so weird I was just doing voiceoverwork!!!!  




 Malcolm Mcdowell just watch the Book of Eli.  




 Normally I will watch most of the major ones including all best picture nominees. this year I might take it a step further and watch EVERY film nominated.  




 I was literally about to post Gary oldman for the Professional good job!!! Another one I can think of is jack Nicholson in the departed he was so awesome in that film!!!  




 Yes I will never forgive the academy for that one, he was easily the best performance in that film and they nominate and give the gold to christoph walz who already had one for playing an evil version of that character basically.  




 A bunch of them. the Lovely Bones is one I haev caught every year since its release because that is my all time favorite movie.  




 OMG YES!!!!!  
























 No  




 indeed  




 Absofreakinlutely  




 WHOA  




 Oh yeah I remember that scene.  




 We Missed you!!!!!!!!  




 good episode god I missed this show!!!!!!!!!!  




 hes in the top 10.  




 Indeed  




 Youve got a playdate with destiny!!!!!  




 id probably put him in the top 20.  




 YEEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH  




 Funny How????  




 Oh god hes such an ass!!!!!!  




 Yeah i remember him.  




 Yeah I remember him.  




 what are some of films best Movie jerks ever?????  




 OMG LOL  




 WTF  




 All of them.  




 thats not the storyline at all LOL.  




 This show hates Black guys LOL.  




 The Revenant 2009 
 




 Cool which film????  




 LOL cool.  




 Your mom  




 Star wars I am actually most pumped for that one.  




 whoa youve seen him work???  




 I dont think I have ever read of him actually finishing a movie on time and with no issues.  




 Didnt he threaten one of his actors with a gun or something???  




 I think he said he has no interest in being a big star and he is content with just doing the projects that interest him.  




 Jim Carrey  




 My peers  




 Every time I watch a movie I look up the trivia on IMDB regardless if I have read it before or not.  




 reading the trivia for those ones is like reading a long essay too LOL  




 They are called Stringers I think and yeah its legal just everyone doesnt like you LOL. Its a good movie I watched it last night good performance by Jake and it got me curious about it.  




 Who is Alex trebek???  




 Yes but not for the shaw brothers.  




 We will find out in a few days LOL.  




 Ill check them out they sound interesting  




 This was already common knowledge  




 3 of those things??? WOW I thought there was only 2 sequels.  




 Maybe  




 Ive only seen one polanski film the ninth gate, I was thinking about watching some of his other movies but its hard to knowing that he should be in jail.  




 Most of his later movies are shit anyways plus he is a racist ahole.  




 Thats kind of a bad reason LOL  




 I was thinking of seeing maps to the stars but I didnt know he was in it oh well I guess I will watch my second movie of him.  




 Thats pretty much me too.  




 Robert Patinson because I never liked him and I have only ever seen one movie with him harry Potter.  




 I remember seeing the previews and stuff when it was first released and thinking it was a ghost film or something instead its about deacon frost wanting his old house back.  




 Yes LOL  




 The Invisible 2007, its almost like a completely different movie than the trailer shows.  




 Fuck You  




 theyve teamed up before cool!!!!!!  









 Cool  




 I was hoping he would keep doing them and keep doing them.  




 Im sure they will all be remembered.  




 The last 20 minutes of that have always made me sad as hell.  




 It would have been a completely different movie and yes The Joker would return though not as the main villain again. God I wish he hadnt passed away it would have been so epic to see him come back as The Joker.  




 Awesome!!!! I thought Disney gave up on this project but no LOL 




 I saw it on Netflix and was thinking of watching it soon wow thats weird LOL.  




 Ite been rumored for awhile now that he will die in it.  




 Interesting  




 I have seen my all time favorite film exactly 8 times. I tend to watch it once a year only because I dont want it to get stale. 




 I had a black one it was awesome!!!!  




 Sounds about right they seem to act a lot like themselves and stuff plus the music thing LOL.  




 WOW how did I not get this already.  




 Saw it earlier it was pretty good like an R Rated South African Short Circut movie. I will probably see it again but man was Die Antword annoying.  




 Ive watched a few if them from those times the ones I have watched never dissapoint.  




 5 or 6 per week and at least 2 a week in the cinema I also keep track of every movie I watch there I have for the last 5 years. 
I like ALL types of movies but my favorites are action and comedy.
I like current movies like made in the last 10 years but occasionally I will watch something from the 80s or 90s.
 Last 5 were Submarine, Zero Dark Thirty, Selena, Iron man, and The Last Five years.   




 HAHA She thought she was gonna live ahhhh how cute.  




 Sutherland would be cool and Mr T, as well as Ron Perlman, and Michael Chiklis.  




 LOL  




 Saw it yesterday and I LOVED IT!!!!! A really good musical im glad I got the chance to see it in Theaters Anna is so great too I love when she sings.  




 man I cant freakin wait!!!! I have been waiting for season 6 for so long!!!! I will watch it on yahoo screen as soon as it is available.  




 Looks awesome!!!!! cant wait for two more weeks!!!!!!  




 I literally came here to suggest this wow you beat me to it.  




 Yes indeed.  




 Well he is the president he is so bust nowadays.  




 Yeah true.  




 The once a week is better IMO I mean I like House of cards and all of the episodes at once. It just spreads it out more I guess.  




 HMMM Alright I will do that I tend to like movies no matter what. And again I do love anna kendrick.  




 Interesting  




 To those of you who have seen this would you recomend it?? Its playing at an arthouse theater near me and I was thinking about going and watching it on my day off. I do love Musicals and Anna Kendrick.  




 Yeah he was important behind the scenes and most of his appearances were just cameos except for like two of them. RIP Leonard.  




 WHOA I thought he was on more wow was I wrong.  




 AHHH Man I that brings back memories of 1st grade for me.  




 He was playing a certain type one specifically for that film. I hope he at least becomes moderately successful in the business he just needs to do some more stuff.  




 I LOVED IT!!!! When I first saw the previews and stuff i wasnt really interested but when it got all of the oscar noms I saw it and wow was i blown away just like you!!!!!  




 I liked it it was a gimmick yes but one that payed off.  




 He had no cameo it was a major role.  




 I hope so at least a mention theres still time to shoot something real quick.  




 So far i have only read for 40 minutes at the most one of these days though I am gonna read for 3 or more hours at least. It usually takes me a few weeks or more to finish a book.  




 fuck you  









 ROFL  




 No Country for Old Men  




 Cool wish the other guys would return though.  




 Yes such a waste.  




 No that year was the last where they did 5.  




 Not even nominating The dark Knight for Best Picture.  




 Sorry to hear that, my bike was stolen in november I was so pissed. I just recently got a new one and this time i have two locks.  




 Probably dead.  




 Boyhood  




 Every year I think of this god I wish i could time travel.  




 Joy will likely get 20 nominations just like russels movies have in the past.  




 I wish they would change thijngs up at least one year they are always so frekin predictable. Other than that tho I liked them they were funny and neil was great.  




 Yes I try to watch most of the acting categories at least I never really get around to watching all of the best picture nominees though.  




 Riggan Thomson  




 Sad news I wish they would just make it already!!!!
