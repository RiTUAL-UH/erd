 Same thing happend to me. Only way I was able to settle this was to show PROOF of ownership by looking up my modem s/n via the manufacturer website. Actually, proof that Comcast didn't purchase it. For Arris/Motorola/General Instruments:

 Google 'CA Proxy' - then update your internet proxy settings. 









 Yes fortunately. But you can register to allow login or call their support line and hopefully they'll provide the proof of purchase.  




 For Motorola / General Instruments / Arris: https://mobilityonline.motorola.com/services/BCSApps/BCSSerialSearch.aspx

  What's the manufacturer name for your modem? 




 Nope - self install/provisioned online when I plugged it in. 




 Bummer. Usually you can confirm modem ownership if you contact the manufacturer. They can decipher the serial number to determine original purchaser. 




 Ditto same thing I purchased a docsis 3.0 modem from Newegg, then I was billed for renting my own modem. Tried 3 times to remove the rental fee. Their warehouse folks claimed they owned the modem after verifying serial number. I went to Motorola's broadband unit ownership portal, typed in my serial number and showed PROOF it was purchased by Newegg. They finally removed the fee.

 I purchased the Lenovo Q190 and installed XBMC for all my multimedia needs. Works great, but comes pre-loaded with Windows 8. Cost: ~$299. Here's a xbmc [discussion thread.](http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=157563) 




 Unfortunately, the majority of US cities have no competing alternatives, including mine in Atlanta. 




 Just like most folks here, I have several bills I pay on a monthly basis, and never think twice about paying them. But with Comcast, I utterly despise each month I give them money. I feel as if I'm directly funding their company to stifle innovation and competition. Data usage caps, overage fee's directly influence how future technologies are developed. It pisses me off to no end and I feel sorry for the next generation folks who have to put up with this bullshit.

 Here's some reasons, which ironically is provided on **[Wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Wikipedia)**:

  

* Anyone can change an article in Wikipedia. Because of this, some articles in Wikipedia may not be completely true and accurate. Instead, they may show a hoax or false information.

* There is the problem of vandalism, or purposefully making bad edits. Some vandalism is easy to see. 
* Other vandalism may be harder to find.

* Sometimes, people have a strong opinion about a subject. They will try to control the articles about that subject.

* Things stated in articles need to have reliable sources. This is especially needed if there is controversy (argument) about them. Often there are controversial claims in articles, without good evidence.

* Some editors do not like each other; they will do things that do not make the Wikipedia better (like edit wars)

* 
A lot of the time, one group of people wants to change Wikipedia more than others. For this reason,
the opinions of that group and their interests may be covered more in Wikipedia. This is usually called a systematic bias, and can be very misleading, because it only shows one side of an argument. There are also certain kinds of social groups that begin to think alike. This means that the group of editors as a whole want to please themselves rather than change articles.

 Yea - I think a rep reviews and will reply. Try calling them up if you don't hear back. They're required to provide you with this information.

 If you watch TV via digital set-top, it's a data transmission. So if you leave your set-top on 24/7, how come that's not being charged for usage?  

My point is, it shouldn't matter how much data is used, just like the air you breath.

 I think if you register your modem via my.netgear.com, it'll provide this information. If not then email customer.service@netgear.com requesting ownership information. They should be able to tell you who purchased the modem - if it was a cable company it'll have their company name since they purchase directly from Netgear.

   "This is my way of proving that the NSA isn't invincible and that the rules of mathematics are stronger than the rules of any state," he added. "Even so, I generally shy away from calling anything 'NSA-proof' since even with as much as we know from recent NSA coverage, there might be more secrets waiting to be revealed."
