 Yeah, I'm back on them now broseph.  




 Edit: I've been back on my meds, but I've kinda not taken them properly? What I mean by this is, I wake up at weird times of the day, so I take my morning dose a little bit later and my nightly dose a little bit later, but so far, I still have my symptoms somewhat under control.  




 Those are non-specific symptoms I believe. 




 I think we still use it, but very rarely... Do vets not use it anymore? 




 I live in the UK and I know that we use it but I've never actually even seen anyone on ketamine here, weird. I would love to try some if I could find it somewhere.  




 I started taking prescription opiates at about 14-15 with my girlfriend at the time. Do I regret it? Yes and No.  




 That's pretty much true I suppose, but it definitely depends on how you look at it. For example, opiates, benzos etc. won't produce the same "euphoria" as say, MDMA, Cocaine etc. 

 




 I was just wondering what your thoughts on stimulants were? I know that for me when I have some extra money I will buy any real stimulant I can get, usually Methylphenidate and Amphetamine (Rarely). I usually do this 1-3 times a year, but from my recent usage of stimulants I have realized that I don't really like them that much, but I use them because I used to really, really love stimulants. It's kind of a weird relationship with them.

Anyway, what are your thoughts on stimulants? 




 Why the heck would they put someone with psychosis on anti depressants, especially Bupropion. They should've started you off with an anti psychotic first, that's what usually SHOULD happen. 

How long do you have to wait for? (I live the UK so I don't really understand health insurances). 

Edit: If you were depressed before, then you should've been put on an anti depressant AND an anti psychotic, but it's still kinda weird putting someone with Drug Induced Psychosis on anti depressants, especially if it wasn't caused by the depression (Psychotic depression).  




 Mood lift does count as euphoria, same with sociability (to me anyway, because I'm usually not social). Well I didn't feel anything noticeably physical, so I don't think it was much L-Amphetamine, but I could be wrong on that.  




 I think your doc is correct, you are definitely paranoid for sure, so the drug induced psychosis thing is definitely a good Dx. I have schizophrenia, so I know what it's like, albeit a little different but when I'm in a psychotic break, its essentially all the same. Are you taking any medications for this psychosis? 

MDMA and Coke can both cause psychosis if abused the way you abused them, and acid also can I believe, but more commonly it's usually HPPD with acid but psychosis can definitely happen with the use of acid as well. So basically, you abused 3 drugs that can cause psychosis... Hopefully you're taking some meds, or therapy at least, but psychosis usually can't be solved by just therapy itself.

Stay safe.  




 You do realize that Amphetamine is a euphoriant?  




 So, I remember taking Freebase (Paste) Amphetamine from the streets that my sister had at my cousins wedding, she gave me a dab of it, and it didn't feel as good as something like Ritalin (that I've use quite a lot in the past). I know Amphetamine is meant to be better than Ritalin, but to me, it felt like pretty much nothing. I thought this was weird, I did get a nice feel for the music and I did get pretty talkative, but not that much, and there was no body like euphoria there. Why is this? It's kinda strange to me.  




 DHC is good, it actually feels a tad weaker than codeine to me for some reason, but it definitely lasts A LOT longer. I'm guessing codeine is pretty strong for me because I must be a good metaboliser. Have fun. 




 I've never really felt anything from caffeine, it hardly even keeps me awake, but I do drink a lot of energy drinks and stuff pretty much daily.  




 Why do people say, "I laughed longer than I should have"... How long are you meant to laugh, is there guidelines that I don't know about?  




 During the black death, it wasn't just the bubonic plague, it was also the pneumonic plague, which, is extremely contagious.  




 If you can't even speak proper English, then you can't make a cheat, whatsoever.  




 I can tell you this with experience, a lot of the time when someone gets a prescription for oxy, sooner or later, they will do something illegal with it (snorting, injecting, or just taking it for a buzz and no longer for pain). Criminalizing anyone for drug abuse/use when they are otherwise a loving parent is just, insane. Also, I think you CAN do something about it, YOU can also fight back at the heart of it.

And it would be nice to become a foster parent when I'm a little older. 

But can't you just change something at the core? Yeah, we should do something to, but YOU (and others that work in the system) can change it at it's very core. 




 Thing is, weed? Really? You wouldn't take a kid away from a family that has a few too many every night, but are otherwise loving... I just don't get it. 

Also, a parent popping a few oxy because of their "bad back" is fine, right? But weed obviously isn't because its the "law". 




 If you truly believe in that, then you aren't a modern feminist, so, good for you.

You're an egalitarian, which is great.  




 I'm sorry, but is a job more important than a persons life?  




 Hey, why don't you draw something as good or even better than this then? 




 This is actually somewhat a good story, believable and the doc will also feel sorry for you. 




 Not exactly true in all cases. 




 I had a very hard time, I know I'm schizophrenic but I there has been people that do good without meds.  




 Where do you live? I live in the UK and people with bad back pain, arthritis (depends on the type) and other shit get opiates codeine to oxy.  




 Why do people not like morphine? I dont get it... 




 Okay, so I know its incredibly stupid to come off meds without a doctors go ahead or supervision, but I accidentally came off my meds a few days ago (Seroquel) and I'm not doing so bad, the meds were working, which is good, but I wonder how long I can last before I relapse into the illness again... What if I never get ill again? I mean, do I need the meds? I'm not even sure if I even need meds... 

This is just some thoughts I wanted to write down and decided to make a reddit post.  




 Also, the OP is 20, opiate prescriptions at 20 aren't uncommon at all. 




 Question, how does going on methadone or sub screw the OP from an opiate script for the rest of his life? Here in the UK (depending on the doc I guess) I can still get opiate prescriptions for legit pain even though I am a recognized addict, even though its a little harder I might add.

Is it different in the US? Because I'm sure a doc wont just leave someone in pain just because someone's an addict. 




 Man, that's fucked up. I live in W. Scotland and my town is like 10k population (if that) and I can walk to the pharmacy which is about 5 mins walking and I'd probably see at least one or two blatant heroin addicts.  




 You may be schizophrenic, but most of what you describe is some sort of personality disorder, like sociopathy with some narcissism... Can anyone correct me if I'm truly wrong?  




 I'm sorry, but how can you be a junkie depending on the day you're having? Elaborate please. 

And western feminism is completely lost... Equalitarianism is better. 




 Either idiocy or extreme corruption.  




 Feminazis are worse than any form of junkie, so it really doesn't matter.  




 I've heard a while back (kinda just remembered) that a lot of schizophrenics gets better faster and better over time than the ones on meds. In my opinion I think that's somewhat false because everyone is different, but have you heard about that?  




 Morning is usually a break from my illness for me, until about 2 hours after I wake up, and then when it hits dark, I get really paranoid and my illness basically just gets worse during the dark.

I also get more depressed during the dark.  




 I know this is old news but it really does outrage me when shitty clinically retarded (probably 10 IQ) come into someone's house and shoot a harmless dog (and I mean harmless, eg labs, Jack Russell's etc) for no good reason other than being a brainless sub 10 IQ moron that should be euthanised. YOU DO NOT TAKE A DOGS LIFE OVER DRUGS, ESPECIALLY WEED. 

Also to cops that know cops that do this, give them this message, if
you come into my house and shoot anything for no reason, I will, and I repeat, I will get a gun and blow atleast one of your retarded brains out, thanks. 

I don't care If this sounds stupid, but it angers me beyond belief. Thanks for listening.   




 Either a mental condition or he is just fucking with everyone. 




 It's sad that certain African countries governments are so corrupt that they give about 2% of the donations to their people basically live and THRIVE through them. Have you seen certain African country leaders? They live in wealth, while their people live in extreme poverty.  




 Also, does any leader that starts unnecessary wars deserve compassion? Like a lot of US presidents, UK prime ministers etc? 

But civilians that have done nothing to deserve this, they indeed, need all the compassion they can get.  




 I love how you take that out of context...  




 Things have changed, but most of the donated cash goes to the government of certain African countries and the government of these countries basically steal the donations. 




 Everyone deserves compassion... 




 Isn't China/Chinese more clean than most of the west as well? Or am I wrong?  




 What do you mean 'Yes'... Do you mean that's what you believe or are you just answering?  




 People still believe schizophrenia means split personality? My god...  




 FEAR THIS NOW!!! 




 Not to give in to hysteria... Does he realise he's talking to the human race here?  




 No one really gives two fucks about terrorists, well compared to this anyway.  




 Enzymes bro, everyone's different. 




 It's not just bad that they're spewing misinformation (of course that's bad) but it's when people basically say that you can't have schizophrenia because you can type or make somewhat coherent sentences, because we already have a hard time believing that we're ill in the first place. 




 So in my experience I have encountered a lot of people that just don't believe schizophrenics are on the Internet. It's gotten to the point that in online society that if you even ADMIT you have schizophrenia, everyone laughs, why is this? It's as if that if you have schizophrenia or even bipolar (to a lesser extent maybe) that you can't come online, it's just simply impossible to these people.

Does the wider Internet still believe that schizophrenics pretty much just sit in a corner and cry or babble insanity as if we are insane? Do they not realise that we are just normal people that can come online and share experiences? I don't get it. 

I've even seen people that are allegedly in a psychosis come on reddit and type their thoughts, of course when I'm in a severe psychosis I don't say anything online about it and sometimes end up in hospital or... Worse, but I'm not in a CONSTANT severe psychosis that some people seem to think. 

So basically what I'm annoyed at is, on the wider Internet if you even ADMIT you're schizophrenic, you're deemed a fake and a "dumbass". Its really put me down because now, I don't know if what I experience is real. Maybe I am just a dumbass. Who knows. 

Please share you're thoughts, this was just a rant.  




 Have fun with that man, Gabapentin and Hydro, nice.  




 So basically what I was saying is that my psychosis came first and I basically found some prescription opiates and thought that maybe this will help (which it did at the time).  




 Yet to read it all yet but for me I started taking opiates (before I was prescribed meds) to basically try and "self medicate" so to speak... So for me it's/was basically a form of instant relief in a way. Anyway, love your blog :). Gonna read it all now.  




 I've been diagnosed btw, I dunno if that was a quote that yoh responded to about me or not haha... anyway may I ask something (that MAY be kinda personal) in a pm?  




 But what I'm telling you is just what I've gathered from a lot of health professionals (neurologists and stuff also) and about a year and a bit of opiate use. 

So schizophrenia wasn't really caused by anything for me, it's just stuff I've gathered from health pros :). 

And even they don't even fully understand the brain  




 Scientifically though, opiate use no matter what stage USUALLY doesn't do anything long term, except maybe depression. Also opiates have Anti depressant, anti anxiety and anti psychotic properties (I have no idea why they have anti psych properties, I don't even think scientists know this because we don't know SHIT about the brain let alone schizophrenia. 

Opiates are actually one of the safest drugs (besides weed, heck even weed can bring schizophrenia out apparently). I know quite a lot about drugs especially opiates and alcohol since I was addicted to opiates and my parents are alcoholics.

 




 It really depends on the drug, for example, opiates/opioids will not give you psychotic symptoms (except maybe through withdrawal) but drugs like amphetamine etc can. So you have to consider that.  




 Yes I have tried a few other meds, they either produced more symptoms or made me a zombie (but not sedated just emotion wise). They're working a little I guess, they've made me more insightful but the symptoms clear up then come back for longer than they've cleared up, it pretty much feels like the meds are trolling me.

I don't feel like being medicated forever, I'm just a little sad with having a mental illness I guess. Thank you for your input. 

Also, it's just my positive symptoms that somewhat get better, negatives never have.  




 I've started seroquel as my new med, I've been on it for a month and a bit, and I've been starting to get a bit better but now it feels like symptoms still breakthrough and they're doing it a lot harder now, are meds just a false hope, I was pretty much better for a week and a half (maybe 2) and it feels like everything is coming back, especially paranoia (not so much the people inside my head).

I think meds are just a false hope... no point in them now. Love you guys :* 




 Make them live with an alcoholic for 15 years. 




 I'm still in that phase were the illness is really bad... And what makes the social aspect worse is, I have really bad disorganized thoughts, I talk a little like this, "yeah so I um I dunno what I was saying so maybe we can go and chill out at the mountain? Yeah uh, yeah I dunno". Which is hard. 




 Ever since I got my first symptoms of this disease I started withdrawing, it took a little over a year to basically be in complete isolation, I'm in the midst of this isolation and it's killing me, it feels like I've pushed all of them away, and it hurts that I don't have my best friend anymore, he's been my friend for a very long time. 
Please help me, I don't know what to do, I see pictures of all of them having fun on Facebook, I drove past them all today, and they saw me like they saw a ghost... I just want my old life back. 




 Would you rather everyone essentially going mad?  




 Man, I can't handle pain at all. I had a lumbar puncture and needed pain meds for a week or two. Your pain threshold must be higher than Pluto compared to mine. 




 WHAT? No narcotics? Damn, how can it not hurt? I thought the mouth and stuff had pain receptors. 




 http://imgur.com/qUlb8G4 




 I feel like I'm a pussy for not being able to handle it better, sometimes I think everyone has what I have and they're just better at dealing with it and I'm lower than everyone.

Thank you, a lot. I don't know if I've hit rock yet, but I think I'm slowly getting there, but I don't want to, I want to go up NOW!!! 




 I did start CBT but I never finished it. It's really hard to do CBT for depression and anxiety when I'm psychotic, thank you for giving moral support so to speak. 




 Hey. So I've had moderate episodic depression for a while now along with schizophrenia and I just feel like it never gets better, the loneliness, the sadness, emptiness etc. sometimes when I come out of it I think that I will never go back into it, only to find my self depressed again. It's like it gives me hope when it goes away, and then takes all that hope away when it comes back.

Meh, I must just be a pussy. But does it ever get fully better? Ever?  




 But why would people thinking because I'm sometimes aware I'm ill that I can't be disabled with it? That's like saying people that know they have the flu or cancer can't be disabled with it, right? 




 Well, she thought the symptoms of schizophrenia weren't actually symptoms, which obviously made my depression worse because she put me down for having symptoms that she didn't see as symptoms... I just want to know why people do that? I don't get it.

And of course it made my schizophrenia worse because I lost more and more insight because of her.  




 I'm not irritated at all by self diagnoses, as long as you're very educated on mental health, as you said you were.

People in my family knew I was schizophrenic before any doc diagnosed me, so self diagnoses or semi self diagnoses or family diagnoses (in my case) can be helpful to the person and the doctor that will later diagnose you, well, in my case that's how it went.

And all you can do is get out of the house and get a psychiatrist AND psychologist and if you need one, someone that's educated on mindfulness, or research that form of meditation yourself and try it out while you're "in the dark" so to speak when it comes to meds. :)  




 The people that you would never think to even be depressed, commit suicide from it... It's extremely sad and shocking.

I'm very sorry, RIP.  




 Hey, so a story of my ex girlfriend... 

Well, every time I was in the midst of a delusion and acting weird and strange, and very out there and you know, "paranoid", she would get angry and say, "you can't POSSIBLY blame your disorder/illness for this", I found this very insensitive and out right stupid.

As the disease progressed I would stop seeing people, essentially isolating and not washing and having thought issues, like word salad, and again she would look at me weirdly, scoff and say, "you can't blame schizophrenia *scoff*"... Funny thing is I never blamed schizophrenia at all.

And this goes for hallucinations and my depressive episodes too.

Why is this? Please answer anyway you want, you don't have to be nice if you don't want to :).  




 How do you know you're bipolar without a Dx? 




 I have a form if schizophrenia, and I'd like to ask, what's the worst mental illness to date? Jw.  




 Do you like fame? If so, why? 




 Everything in my head is telling me I'm dying, I just want some help, I'm in seroquel, I just want something to make me feel normal. I feel really trapped in my head and don't have anyone really to talk to. Thank you. 




 I've been told it can happen in psychotic disorders too (but I might be wrong). Maybe your brain is overwhelmed with all the noise and stuff and becoming detached. 

And trauma doesn't HAVE to happen, no.  




 Dissociation? 




 Sorry for bad writing  




 Oh and suicide wasn't exactly in my thought, I'm thinking ebola got me  




 I love I'm the uk and I got sick and I'm in fear of my life that I got or had ebola and I'm giving it to people or that I'm slowly dying from it without knowing... And even if I didn't get it, what stops me from getting it in the future, I don't know what I'm even thinking... Just round and round, ebola, ebola, ebola in my head... What is this?  




 May I ask? Do you have any mental illness that makes you paranoid? Not judging as I do too but I try and not believe my insanity. 




 Hi, im still here. I was having a VERY bad few weeks, I'm starting to have some better days. I has a lumbar puncture so I've been incapacitated with pain. 









 For me at the start of delusions I know it's paranoia, then after a while if I don't take meds for a few weeks while it's starting, or maybe 5 months idk, I totally lose insight and shit... It's all insight. 




 So why are people wanting to kidnap me and my family and torture us? Why can't I think? Why can't I have relationships that last? Why do the voices commentate in what I'm thinking or doing? What is all of this? Why does it even exist, fuck it all.  




 This psychotic shit happens non stop, with or without meds, they just make it easier, without meds, I have no idea what time and place is. 




 I would give you gold if I had money, but most of it goes on opiates  




 Lately I've been having really on and off nausea, I've been having to force myself to vomit... I've been somewhat constipated (not going to the bathroom as much I used to) and unable to pass gas... I feel pretty bloated in the general abdominal, and my stomach is rumbling quite loudly and I've also had a runny nose. What could this be?  




 Either the pain meds (hydro) is causing it, or making the ibs worse... But without extra info or more symptoms I can't say for sure. 




 Well I knew I had some sort of mental illness before most doctors... Didn't know exactly what one, just thought some of the shit I was hearing and thinking wasn't right. 




 Haha, I love you man ha. 




 The longest I've made it is nearly 2 weeks lol, I've tried many times... But bad shit in life when you're trying to stop seems even worse, and that's what always makes me go back, ill try and make today my last:) 




 Alcohol made my dad into a loving caring emotional person into a hateful abusing pile of shit, in a matter of years...  




 I don't even know what I'm doing anymore, opiates aren't even recreational fun anymore, they're just something to block out the pain in life and stop my fucking obsessive fucking tendencies and all that shit, idk what I am saying, just sick of having to go through  so much shit day to day and having to hide it from everyone that can help me... What's the point? Does anyone have any advice here? I need my life back  




 I hate how people say addicts are these evil people, when in reality it's usually the opposite. 




 If I HAD to choose between alcoholism and opiate dependency, I would choose opiate dependency by far... Alcoholism fucked my family up. 
























 That USED to happen to me early into my usage. 




 They have a form of it called Lunesta (Eszopiclone).  




 None anymore but I used to smoke Marlboro and Mayfair (a British brand). 




 Isn't it Sched 1? 




 Overdosing on opiates, especially heroin, would usually kill you quite fast and painlessly when you IV (that's why it's my get out free card). You basically just pass out and not wake up again. Dunno about snorting though, just sounds like you got super high like everyone else is saying.  




 Damn... This sub is actually starting to give gold now, seen it a few places on here... We have evolved! 




 The question is relatively simple but basically every time I don't use I get very, very agitated and angry. The only way to solve it is to know I'm getting some pills or whatever. Does anyone else get this? Is it common? 




 Having to confess a porn addiction for just watching porn at 17 is total and utter retardation. What a shitty situation... *Fucking religion*. 




 Nice one. /s 




 The US doesn't control everything you know... Just sayin'...  




 Do you think these riots will cause something bigger to happen in Mexico? Like a revolution?  




 What I mean by BPD is Borderline Personality Disorder, it's extremely complex, but the symptoms he has from it are basically, suicide threats, and what you just described there "*He's also telling me I'm better off leaving him one moment then demanding we get artificial insemination*" which rings borderline for me. The cold rage as you describe it, definitely sounds either like sociopathy or narcissistic personality disorder, or both (both of them happening together is very common). 

NPD and Sociopathy (anti social personality disorder, but I don't like calling it that because it's way too broad of a term) happen very, very, very commonly. More commonly than I would like to believe. 

He needs either a form of intensive treatment, or you just leaving him, as hard as that may be.  




 This sounds like an incredibly difficult situation. It's downright emotional/psychological abuse, and that can be worse than physical abuse because it lingers for a very long time once you're out of the relationship. Like the others here have said, I've never seen someone with depression persistently abuse their SO, yeah, maybe it happens but it's relatively rare, especially at a persistent rate. I would also like to know what you mean by cold rage? I have an idea, but not sure what you exactly mean by it. Another likely possibility is that he has a personality disorder and not depression, this could range from BPD (which is things like, threats of suicide, self harm etc. among other things of course), Anti-Social PD (basically sociopathy/psychopathy, but I believe it's a more broad term), Narcissistic personality disorder (which, is actually somewhat likely in this case). 

My advice is to take a break and check him into a hospital if you can, in fear for his and yourself's safety. On the break, think, think about your relationship, and think about who he really is and if he deserves to be with you in his current state. 

I'm not a doctor, so I can't exactly say if he's depressed or has a PD or nothing, I just don't exactly know for sure. 

Also, you're definitely not too "old" to have kids, that's silly, 28 yrs old is a decade and a half away from being too "old". Also, fat at 165? That's just simply bullying, and false. 

Anyway, I hope you get through this, life is hard and it's even harder when someone is somewhat weighing you down... As hard as that is to hear.  




 You'll most likely not get a heart attack. I have a history of heart disease in my family, and Ritalin (which is more hard on your heart I believe) has never gave me a heart attack and I've been on and off it for at least 7-8 years. Also, frequent heart burn isn't a thing to do with your heart, it's stomach acid jumping up to the throat and chest and you SHOULD get it checked out, because if it's really frequent it could be GERD.  




 Seroquel is pretty sedating, and by pretty, I mean really, really sedating until you build a good enough tolerance (which is also hard for me because I come off my meds). I am not Bipolar though, just schizophrenic. For some people it doesn't work (or it's just so sedating that there is no point in taking it). 

It takes away the good feelings for anyone I believe because it basically blocks dopamine (among other things). 

The sedation may go away (it does for me if I take it for long enough) or it may not... Will it work? Maybe, or maybe not (if you've been taking it longer than 2.5 weeks and it still hasn't made you feel better, then change the med. 

I would ask your doc for depakote or lithium, and try that with another anti psychotic (abilify might work for you).  




 So here's the thing, I know that the game is supposed to be "emotional" or whatever, but I just don't see it. This game (whether I am watching someone play it or I am playing it myself) doesn't affect me. Is it meant to? I don't feel sad, or anything when someone dies, or when I read something that's supposed to be sad, etc... So my question is, is this game meant to be emotional and is it meant to affect me in any way?  




 Yep, for schizophrenia... I'm not honest with my psychiatrist for reasons but I don't see a psychologist.  




 I agree with everything you say. Some may say I'm even on the extreme end of "freedom of choice" because I believe that most drugs (including highly researched opiates) should be as legal as alcohol (with a little more regulation of course).  




 That stopping isn't as easy as it seems... That alcoholics can actually be worse than drug addicts (and most of the time are)... That alcohol kills way more people, than heroin.  




 Psuedoephedrine is technically "addictive". 




 But it's quite sad. It makes me really wonder how many people are cheating... 




 Well, that's fucked up... I'm guessing you live in the US? 




 On probation at 15?  




 I don't understand why 14-15 year old's would be concerned with getting a piss test... 




 Usually they would use something like a benzodiazepine for nausea, and high doses of opiate pain medications (for pain). Both of them get you high. 




 It also might make you feel nauseas because weed is an anti emetic (I believe).  




 I wonder what it must be like to detox from long term use of laudanum. I've never tried PST, and this is what pretty much scares me to try it.  




 That's a rip off imo. You won't be able to make that money back. 




 She didn't know if it was weed or chloroform. 




 [I didn't know Oxy could cause it](http://gyazo.com/2209fb4ee40eba0d13a15ea827d55d66) 




 He looks like there's no one home in there. "It might have rabies", yeah because when an animal has a disease you want to slit it's throat and get its contaminated blood all over you. *smh*

What an idiotic criminal.  




 "ALL OF THIS IS ON RECORD" 




 It's so fake it's funny.  




 I feel like a lot of people wear merchandise to look cool, or to fit into a certain club at school. Not saying that's what you do keep in mind.  




 I know a lot of people that say that they don't like the feeling... I don't get what's different about us and them. It's weird, I might have to ask them.  




 It's extremely irritating. Kurt Cobain wouldn't even want people buying Nirvana T-Shirts anyway, I'm sure... Especially the people that just wear it to see better than others.  




 You're right, it's basically the hydrocodone of the UK... It doesn't mean that there isn't other opiates around though.  




 I hear that a lot by people that take opiate prescriptions for pain and stuff, that they don't like it... I wonder what makes it different from us and them? 




 If it was Fentanyl wouldn't that have been really overpowering for him or worse, kill him? 




 It's always wisdom teeth I hear about (especially with people in the US). What is it with people getting easy opiates through dentistry? My teeth have always been perfect, damn... 




 The face looks odd for the coat and body, still cute though... Should post on /r/aww. 




 I guess I take it for mental problems as well, even though I'm prescribed Seroquel for my Schizophrenia. Apparently opiates have strong anti depressant, anti anxiety and anti psychotic effects. 

I feel you brother, keep on going, you'll eventually reach that peace of mind, one day.  




 I'm from the UK too, and finding Oxy is kinda difficult, but not too hard, and hydro is not prescribed here for some reason, and finding morphine is quite easy, it's probably the most prescribed pain pill for chronic pain (other than Tramadol for the chronic pain), cancer pain etc. in the UK. The reason it's harder to find pills here in the UK is because the "black market" so to speak for pills don't really exist. In the UK (especially scotland) the black market is FILLED with heroin rather than pills (sadly).  




 Peoples pupils react a little slower, differently etc. But yeah, that's generally true, but as I said, peoples pupils ARE different. Also, going up to a guy looking into his pupils would be kinda weird if you ask me. 




 I hope your brother is safe, and when he comes back (notice I say when because it's positive, *yay*) try and get him some psychological help because when someone is using computer duster, they need psychological help because he is probably running away from something or he's trying to deal with some sort of emotional stress.  




 Nitrous is safer, it's used medically... 

Edit: I know not everything used medically is safe, but somewhat gives credibility that nitrous is a lot safer than fucking Computer Duster.  




 What about nitrous? 




 I have a question. What if someone looks at their usage and doesn't see a problem (when it probably is) or just doesn't care? 




 I've never tried Fent, so how long does it last for *you*? 




 He COULD be using stimulants. On the other hand, he could just be very hyperactive or have ADHD? Who knows. Does it really matter to you though? 




 One word... Lighting.  




 It's sorry, not, "sowwie". 




 I started taking opiates for persistent headaches that I still get when I come off of them (even when I'm past the withdrawal), but when I'm on them I get no headaches whatsoever. These headaches were sometimes extremely debilitating and have made me wake up in pain and throw up, other times they're just a 2-4 on the pain scale but can go up to an easy 7-8. I've never had them really checked out, but I did have an MRI and Lumbar Puncture a few months ago and nothing came up, so obviously it's not a tumour or anything... I've not told doctors about my headaches so I've never had them diagnosed, but I came to the suspicion that they're cluster headaches.

*I take opiates for the high as well, but I legitimately need them for pain.*

Now I have a pain in my tailbone area that's been going on for about 3 weeks I would say, I had it checked out last week and the doctor just gave me some shitty Naproxen (which didn't even touch the pain at all) it's EXTREMELY uncomfortable to sit down and about 7-10 when getting up from the seat. Anyway, that's why I take opiates aswell as chasing that high.

What's your story? 




 I'm sorry brother, sending positive vibes your way.  




 Alex Jones: "YOU'RE ALL GOING TO DIE... But first buy my T-Shirts and my DNA FORCE" 




 Good luck finding that, I'll be here when you do.  




 You like it more than heroin? Damn, I gotta try it sometime.  




 Well, basically, I've liked Nirvana for a couple of months as of now, their music is/was just great, but when I mention I like Nirvana or whatever, someone, somewhere, always says, "Then why don't you have Nirvana T-shirts", or, "You're not a true fan of *enter musician here* if you don't have their *MERCH*". It pisses me off because it basically says, even if you like a band or musician or whatever, if you don't have their "merch" then you're not a true fan or a big of a fan as me... As if it's a contest, FUCK YOU to whoever does this.  




 I doubt she would use your hand, that would be lack of trust on another level right there. 1.5 weeks is a long time without talking to your GF/BF/Wife/Husband. I hope (for you) that maybe she's either just, 1.) Sick (Cold, Flu, Allergies, whatever). 2.) Just busy. Hopefully she isn't mad with you or breaking up with you. All the best, stay calm because worrying  and panicking just makes things 10x worse for you.  




 If you've been with her for a while, at least 3 months, then the likely hood of a vengeful ex is pretty slim. Does she know your pass code on your phone? I would just chill out for now and wait and see what happens... I take it she's ignored further text's?  




 Just before me and my ex-GF fully broke up we didn't speak to each other for a week or two, but then again, before that we hadn't even seen each other in person for months. Also, how do you think she would've found out?  




 Opiate crack. 




 [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_fever) 




 Well... Good for you? 




 No, I am Renton from trainspotting.  




 Damn, I wish my psychiatrist or whatever got high...  




 Some people like the 90s grunge junkie look. 




 I always thought having an uncontrollable erection would be great, because if you took some opiates with it you could last forever. 




 You're saying that without giving much information. When someone wants to do something and someone says, "No, do not do it", or anything like that, it makes them want to do it more.  




 You sayin' we're fucked up here? Wanna fight about it? Just kidding, I agree with you 100%.  




 "Disappear" 




 Calling an ambulance was probably the best thing ever. You weren't even there and you still called one for her, that's great. On the other hand, It's not great that you HAD to call the ambulance, I wish you all the luck, I hope she pulls through, my love goes to you and your friend. 

GHB and Benzo's are a no no no no no no mix.  




 Yeah, you definitely don't retain full tolerance forever and ever, that'd just be biologically impossible, but I'm sure that I heard somewhere that your body can handle it better than people that are completely naive.  




 Snort all the dust off the screen? I don't know, just a suggestion.  




 That's something I'm gonna research, your tolerance obviously lowers after months, but I've heard that once you're addicted or tolerant to opiates that your brain recognizes what's happening once you take it again... It's interesting, I don't fully understand it and I don't think anyone really does.  




 Yeah, but your body was still quite familiar with opiates.  




 Then no, there was no build up of MDMA, and even if there was "build up", it would not even be close to enough to get high.  




 They inject into their feet, not their toes, so the doctors made a massive mistake there. I'm the same way, I've had nurses poke holes all over me at the same time trying to find a vein, and I think one poked it in a vein so much she collapsed the vein, or at least damaged it.  




 Why would they even say, "in his toes", I've never heard of a heroin addict injecting into their toes.  




 Lol, have fun fucking your seeds.  




 If you take them all at once? That could be potentially fatal, especially mixing Oxycodone and Morphine at the same times.  




 Being addicted to a drug isn't fun. Having to NEED a substance in your body as if it's food or water is soul crushing. It could take you years and years and years until the addiction finally ruins you and everything around you is gone, and then, you'll probably get help but because the substance had/has such a massive grip on you, what's stopping you going back when things get a little tough? Nothing, unless you have something or someone that keeps you going.

When you're addicted to something (Opiates for me) even if it's ruined everything in your life and you finally get help, you can still (and probably will) relapse a few times into that same thing, that destroyed you.  




 When was the last time you took MDMA when this happened? 




 There's mushrooms and various research chemicals, but that's about it when it comes to psychedelics IME. Meth is extremely neurotoxic same with Cocaine, Dexedrine and Adderall, Ritalin etc. They literally damage your brain, but not only that, they damage the shit out of your heart if you do it long enough. While opiates, don't damage organs at all, the biggest risk from using an opiate is severe repository depression and stopping breathing. 

It's extremely easy to get E here too, but I've just not been involved in that scene in particular yet. I've never tried nitrous but I'm sure it'll cross my path, either medically or just recreationally. DMT is something I wanna try but it's not easy to get here I don't think, the easiest psychedelic to get is shrooms. 

The drugs I have most exp. with are Opiates and Stimulants. The funny thing is, the Amphetamine I've done was from the street, Amphetamine Paste (Oral). The few times I've got it though it's never really hit me as hard as say, Ritalin, for some reason, but Ritalin is said to be the pharmaceutical cocaine.  




 It comes from Afghanistan (the street stuff), but I've heard lately that we grow our own poppy plants for our pharmaceutical stuff, especially the pharma diamorphine. Morphine and Codeine is probably what I will stick with forever because my tolerance never seems to go too high, even after a year and a bit of pretty much non stop abuse. It probably did boost tourism in Glasgow, but it's funny because the movie and book are set in Edinburgh.  

The DHC here the 30mg (per pill) is basically our hydrocodone, and some people say it's better than hydro, and I use that sometimes because it just lasts a lot longer, and feels kinda like dihydromorphine. 


The weirdest thing about my drug history is that I started off abusing stimulants, especially high doses of snorted Ritalin (which will most likely fry your brain if you binge on that stuff for more than a week), and Amphetamine a few times, then basically I saw some codeine 30mg (per pill) and started off abusing Morphine and other kinds of opiates from there. 

Btw, I've only tried Tamazepam 20mg (for sleep during WD), Valium and some Librium I found that was quite old. What's the Valium like for you on a recreational point of view? They never seemed to do much for me. 
 




 I love trainspotting, you can't be Scottish and not have watched/read trainspotting. Also, I can read Scots, I'm from Scotland lol. Yeah, I read it just there because you posted it on this thread, everything said in trainspotting is spot on about heroin, and it really shows the problem with heroin in Scotland. I can literally go down to the local store which is 2-5 mins away walking and see at least 1 to 5 heroin addicts, it's stupidly easy to get heroin here. 

This is my favourite "quote" from the movie: "People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored. But what they forget is the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pissed. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit." 




 Looks like photoshop to me. 

Note: Sarcasm is fun. 




 I had undiagnosed chronic pain, especially really bad headaches (which was the thing I had the longest) which basically felt like my brain exploding  but nothing showed on an MRI or Spinal Tap, and recently I've been having really bad pain in my lower back, tailbone and legs. I had nothing prescribed and didn't even know what an opiate really was back then, so I saw some tramadol and codeine 30s in my cabinet and took some and it made me feel good while taking away all pain. I've not had a headache while on opiates but when off them, it's extremely painful and nothing else solves them. 

Pain sucks bro, especially persistent pain and some doctors won't even prescribe chronic opiates for longer than a few years, when someone might need them for basically ever. 

I've always heard opiate addicts quit for 15-20-30 years and still relapsing and sometimes dying even, opiates have a weird, sometimes life long grip on someone, especially someone with pain. 

Why don't you get a suboxone doc or whatever once you want to quit? 

tl;dr: I started using for pain and recreation at the same time basically.  




 Whatever I can get my hands on really, usually 210-240mg codeine a day and/or 30-100 mg of morphine (depending on ROA), and sometimes 180-210 mg of DHC, which is said to be equivalent to hydrocodone if not better.

A 500mg a day of oxy would've fucked me so hard.

I've only been an "addict" for a year and a few months. You? (If you don't mind answering how long you've been taking opiates). 

Edit: I believe I'm an extensive metaboliser of codeine basically. Living in Scotland, I could easily go and get heroin in about 5 mins, thank god I haven't done that... Yet.  




 Diamorphine is just a short way of saying diacetylmorphine, and yes, the UK does use pharma grade heroin in a hospital setting. I've also seen morphine liquid suspension here, my next door neighbour had some of it when he was dying sadly of cancer. 

Yeah in America you get straight up Oxymorphone, 

Edit: Diamorphine and Diacetylmorphine are both heroin, diamorphine is just a short version of saying diacetylmorphine.  




 They are, but the black market for the Rx opiates aren't here and some drugs don't get prescribed (eg. hydrocodone) but others do like, Oxy, DHC, Diamorphine (in some cases). But the black market for the Rx's don't really exist apart from benzos. 

Also, before they prescribe oxy they usually prescribe morphine pills or liquid.  




 Oxymorphone is a lot stronger than oxycodone because it's the straight drug in your system, 15mg of oxycodone isn't 15mg of oxymorphone, it's just that one of the metabolites of oxycodone is oxymorphone, you follow me? Btw, oxycodone isn't a "pro drug" it just has oxymorphone metabolites. 

I live in the UK and have never heard of anyone being prescribe oxyMORPHONE but oxycodone is quite common for chronic pain. Does Australia not use diamorphine (in a hospital setting or on prescription for terminally ill, usually cancer, patients) like here in the UK? Because I thought I heard someone that you guys do use it, but I'm probably extremely mistaken.  




 Yep, heroin is basically a bullet train going to the brain and once it's there it converts into morphine. Not all opiates convert into morphine though, for example oxycodone and hydrocodone convert into oxymorphone and hydromorphone.  




 You get Oxy, DHC (which some say is better than hydrocodone) and various other opiates in the UK (Including diamorphine in a hospital setting). 




 No problem. 

I've always liked codeine and morphine better than almost any other opiate. People always hate on codeine because they "don't feel anything" but there's multiple factors into why you wouldn't feel much and one of the main reasons is the lack of the (or lowered function) enzyme needed to make CodeineMorphine. 




 Codeine is a pro drug, so basically in order for it to work it needs to be converted/metabolised in the liver by an enzyme called CYP2D6, some people either lack this COMPLETELY or the function of it is basically nil, therefore they can't convert it into morphine as much or at all.

This will kinda explain it a little: http://gyazo.com/5c16983af33c7ce3663fd3804b7e6448 




 IVing things, if done correctly with good techniques, can be really safe (of course not as safe as taking a pill, snorting normally or any other method that doesn't require much technique). Keep in mind also that heroin addicts for example pretty much need to move on to IV because once your tolerance gets stupidly high, smoking, snorting or whatever just doesn't cut it any more and it gets insanely pricey. IVing heroin is cheaper because you need less.  




 Codeine for me is quite good, you have to realize that maybe you're just an ultra poor metaboliser, or just a bad metaboliser.

I for one know that I'm a very good, maybe even ultra rapid metaboliser... Hate it when people bash on codeine. 




 Good luck, opportunities like this should always be seized.  




 I take it you're giving up opiates? If so, good luck bro, see you on the other side one day.  




 Ritalin (Methylphenidate) is what I'm more experienced with, coke costs too much for all that hassle imo.  




 Pretty in pink bro. 




 Methylphenidate makes me crave it so much I redose stupidly high doses until it's all gone. 
























 Yeah well, ours is better, take that! 




 Adderall IS amphetamine.  




 What is the right measurement of laughter? 




 Why do people say it gets better? How can life get better when your future is ruined by an illness inside of your brain? I actually have 2-3 of those illnesses inside my brain. My future is gone, why should I continue and just suffer all the way through it, why can't I be mercy killed, peacefully? I know I may not be terminally ill, but I am chronically ill that makes me wish I was terminally ill just so my suffering would end. How can it get better, when it's already destroyed?  




 CS  Heroin. 




 Looks like super high sens or super high accel, either way, turn that shit down.  




 Every time I watch a pasha stream I want to play again... Then I realize I'm not pasha.  




 Vicodin wont make you spout stupid shit. This guy is just fucked up... Or *trolling*. 




 Oh.. My.. God... THAT'S why there's always smoke there... God dammit. 




 Anti-Psychotics slow down or stop your metabolism all together. I don't get appetite increase that much, maybe I eat a 100 or so more calories than a normal person. 

There is also no way that someone that used to NEVER put on weight put on 80-90 pounds in 11-12 months. It's not possible without eating at McDonalds everyday, every night and every midnight. 

When you say "meds don't cause weight gain"... Steroids do and so do Anti Psychotics...

[here's the evidence, found on the Quetiapine wiki](http://gyazo.com/b363db4cfe0c7a5bd501eb8b1870eff5) 




 Even though I've got somewhat "clinically" better, I now don't see the point in continuing this life. I've lost most of my education (I was a very smart/good student), I've gained about 85-90 pounds in a fucking year from this medication and I don't even eat a lot, I eat normally. I could've went back to my school yesterday, but because I'm so overweight I can't bear the reactions I would get, I don't feel good at all. I have chronic pain as well, and it's undiagnosed because no one cares to help me. 

What can I really do in society? I'm nothing, I can't even function when I'm "better".   




 Jesus gives you morals and the bible is the most moral book in history... /s 




 Gold Nova 3-4 is a lot different from a silver. I've personally never been in silver longer than a day or so though.  




 I hate it when people do things like this. I also hate it when someone rages because they don't do good one game but when they do great the next game (better than you) they say, "I'm so bad", in a snarky, passive aggressive way (I'm not talking about random's here).  




 Yeah, I think I just didn't make it clear enough like you did.  




 "And fentanyl isn't dangerous"... Then he deserves to go shoot up 5mg.  




 Are you 100% sure about that? 




 I think it causes people to focus on it too much and get upset when they rank a little lower. It also causes "elitism" among players. I myself don't like it but at the same time I do like it. I just don't like how it lowers my rank even though I carry my team but we still loose.  




 That depends on height, type of girl etc.  




 I could eat all of these 10x over.  




 What about Opiates? 




 Sure. 




 Every pistol round is a panic.  




 Yet when you hear an accent like mine (Scottish) I bet you get mad because you can't understand me. I don't blame you though, I can hardly understand myself.  




 I usually have a lesser appetite. The only "drug" that's gave me hardcore munchies was a lot of weed. 




 What? How is that weird? Your classmates seem immature.

 




 But what if he thought that giving her this gift would get him at least a date? 




 Leading people on is NOT fair, at all. Just don't accept gifts if you know that this will potentially lead him to believe that there is a chance of dating you.  




 Yep, I agree totally.  




 Wait, what? How do you not know what any of these are... Common knowledge I thought.  




 She seems kinda annoying and bitchy. Don't buy expensive shit for girls when they'll just friend zone you harder and harder.  









 Sorry for not posting anything in the text box... Updated. 




 I wouldn't jump to schizophrenia just yet... 




 Do they not test for fentanyl and fentanyl analogues?  




 Glad you're not another statistic. Always test your shit before you do it. It was most likely fentanyl, fucking retarded cut if you ask me, but whatcha gonna do when the government illegalizes drugs and makes them unsafe?

Again, glad you're okay. 




 Sorry I didn't put anything here, I didn't know exactly what to put. I asked this question because I started LISTENING to William Burroughs read the book and got quite hooked, still haven't finished it though as it's 3 hours long... Gonna listen on and off, seems really good. 

I just wanna know what you think about it.  




 Welcome, and enjoy your stay... *dark laugh*.  




 3:54 is probably the best part.  




 Don't beat a dead horse. 




 It'll come back like people here have said. It's usually the other way around for me, usually I have 0 sex drive when I'm using and it comes back with a vengeance when I get clean.  




 That's fucked up man, punch him right in the dick. 

I just got my script filled (Scotland here), and I overheard someone trying to fill their opiate script and the person working there said, "Sorry, this is a controlled drug so you need a recent script (or whatever), but if you just go over to the doctors office I'm sure they'll write it for you and once they do, just come back over and we'll fill it"... So atleast there's some good people working at pharmacies.  




 I wish I was a rat... I would get all kinds of drugs all the time.  




 Do you take them longer than 1 month straight? 




 But subs basically make you dependent on THEM. It's like trading one thing for another, and the other doesn't even make you feel good... 




 *I guess they just stopped giving a fuck*... Truest thing I've read lately.  




 Why can't you guys buy codeine OTC? You can seem to do it in almost every other country.  




 I always hide my shit because I always go looking for shit when I'm sick and I usually find it, it feels like winning the lottery even though I put it there.  




 That taste smell combo when you're coming up is amazing.  




 As people said, alcohol and apap will hurt your liver, but drinking + opiates, can kill you, and has killed people through respiratory depression.  




 Morphine is made to be shot up, oral and snorting bio sucks so much.  




 Yep, pharma grade heroin is clear as water.  




 It most likely wasn't just heroin, it was most likely cut with fentanyl as well.  




 Si.  




 Yes, yes you do. *hugs* 




 This is what professional means...  




 I wouldn't call them "anonymous **PSYCHOPATHS**". Most people on the internet that send death threats are just people that can't take their inner rage out at someone in real life, so do so to someone they hate over the internet.  




 He just said he was 1.  




 ESEA: Here Valve, this is how you do it. 




 Or it's British for disgusting, dirty etc.  




 Best strategy. 




 JW's name shouldn't be 'JWonderchild' it should be 'JWanker'...  




 I wouldn't say you're schizophrenic at all. Schizophrenia is a chronic illness, and the early signs are usually there for years before you get a full blown episode, and months (sometimes years) you get a prodrome which is basically the illness leading up to the illness. 

You're just paranoid, people with bipolar can get paranoid too you know.

I'm schizophrenic btw, if that means anything. 




 It's really good. I'm so bad at ready walls of text though because I usually miss lines... Upvoted. 




 His poetry usually makes no sense at all, it's actually really amusing.  




 Mixing Ambien w/heroin is just about as dangerous as mixing benzos and dope.  




 In my view, I think that if you legalize heroin for 21+ at about 2.5g per 2-3 days then that would actually help more people than it hurts. Getting heroin off the street is what makes heroin dangerous. Pharma grade diamorphine (heroin) is no worse than oxycodone, morphine etc... Hydromorphone is actually stronger I believe. 

Over here in the UK we already use diamorphine medically, and not just for terminally ill patients either. 

Edit: Nothing ever happens over night, and nothing ever happens if we just sit on our asses and do nothing because we think it's impossible.  




 Are you against recreational legalization? 




 Yep... Most drugs that have been highly researched (including most opiates) should be legal.  




 I do believe how things are worded matter, I just don't think anyone should really care about it if we kinda know what he meant... You know what I mean?  




 Man, who cares on how he worded it? Cut the dude some slack. 




 I know that my life may not be completely ruined but I just can't help that I could've done so much more if it weren't for me being "ill". I've even said to my self, "what's the point in going back if I'm a year and a bit behind everyone". Nothing feels like a huge accomplishment, it feels more like a completely failure in my life, and that I've dug a hole that I can't get out of because of something that I couldn't have controlled, or maybe I could've controlled it... I don't know any more. 

I have positive times where I say to myself, "maybe school just isn't/wasn't for me right now and that I've learned a lot of stuff myself and maybe that'll come in handy", but no one else seems to agree... I know that I have to go back to school, that's not what I am even saying to people, I'm just saying that I've learned a lot of somewhat useful things while I wasn't at school, but people always seem to disagree when I bring that up thinking that I mean that I won't go back to school, and it shoots my confidence all the way back down again. 

Thank you for making me feel better and actually listening to what I have to say, unlike others in my life right now. 




 My man Vincent, you always have money... You need more opiates for that money you always got.  




 Damn man, to be fair, I would probably do that haha. You would have taken them again if you did, most likely. 




 If it's stealing illegal drugs, then it's a little different because I doubt that the guys that got robbed are gonna go to the cops and complain that their heroin was stolen.  




 Fires smell good... I don't know why, but they do. 

Note: I don't set stuff on fire.  




 Quick question though... Is it possible to EVER take stuff from the pharmacy, in small quantities, because I've heard of pharmacists doing that.  




 I never understood why people don't like opiates, whereas people like us do? I'm on a mission to find out... 

Note: We were nauseas on them first too, so it can't be that.  




 I'm not a girl, I'm just fat as fuck lol, but I've never had good veins, even when I was a normal weight... They're always hiding, even nurses/doctors have a hard time.  




 I'd like to point this out, as crazy as this may sound /s... Giving someone a syringe that they are paying for is extremely humane. How would you like it if you were addicted to heroin, and no one gave you a clean rig, and you contracted a life threatening disease, like Hep C and HIV?  




 I literally can never see my veins... I always wanted veins like those, *sigh* maybe in another life. Hope you enjoy that shit.  




 I don't really know where to start, but I'll try anyway. I was diagnosed with Psychosis NOS about a year and a few months ago, then it progressed into a diagnosis of basically schizophrenia, to put it bluntly. With schizophrenia we have 2 blocks of symptoms, negative and positive. Negative is basically, lack of emotion, extreme lack of motivation, poor hygiene, disorganization (which Is pretty strong for me, stronger than the other negative symptoms) etc. Positive symptoms are just basically psychosis. Anyway, because of this, I had do drop out of school, as directed by my doctors. I lost most of my friends, except one and he has always been my best friend, but he's just came back into the picture (which is great btw, when you've been in extreme isolation for a year that shit will touch your heart more than anything). Being in extreme isolation and barely getting sunlight other than the sun rays coming through my window, is extremely depressing especially when you're not in an episode and have to reflect on how this has affecting your life... 

I've just started getting tutoring back in my school, once a week... I don't see the point in going back to school any more, I'm already behind everyone, people think I'm stupid because I don't go to school (even though I've learned a lot of stuff on my own in the past year). Schizophrenia (with depression, but depression hasn't been diagnosed, it's probably depression because of the schizophrenia). I feel absolutely hopeless, it's like I can't get something inside my head out... I just want to be normal again, but there's always something inside my mind stopping me. I used to think I would have a good career, have a good life etc... That's all completely ruined now.

I'll answer any question to clarify anything... Thank you. 




 Here in Scotland we don't have to pay for scripts, you live in England? 




 Trainspotting.  




 Everyone knows that green crack doesn't cure anything, it just makes you go insane, kill everyone then turn gay... /s 




 Kinky... 




 Why not? I would show this to my boss... 




 I was watching a little bit of news last night for some reason on TV (I live in the UK), and they still spoke about it a little.  




 Do you know how the world works? Or do you live in a delusion of grandeur all the time?   




 Highly contagious Bird Flu is probably my worst fear when it comes to pandemics.  




 Illuminati confirmed...   




 I honestly think Half Life 3 or EP3, will still be coming out... You know, they could be doing this all for marketing. Making people wait 10 or maybe 15 years, that could drive sales through the roof when it finally comes out, I would think.  




 Yeah I figured it might not be used for that, I'm not actually prescribed it for insomnia, I'm prescribed it for schizophrenia but it was nice to have that sleep aid feature... And dude, that sucks, ask your doc for a benzo or something to sleep.  




 I just got prescribed Seroquel XL 200mg. I used to take 100mg x2 but because it's easier to take 1 pill rather than 2 a day she moved me onto the prolonged release. I am not sleeping when I take it at night, it doesn't even make me tired like the IR versions did, not even one bit... Actually, the first time I took it (which was last night) I was up all night until 9am. I don't understand because Seroquel used to make me pretty tired when I took my night time dose, but the XL doesn't at all... Why is this? I of course take it for Schizophrenia but it was nice to sleep when I took it because I do usually have insomnia as well.  




 The "weed" smokers that spoke about it non stop and acted higher than they actually where in high school were probably the most annoying people at that time. 




 That would be cool as hell. 




 You are incredibly wrong and ignorant.  




 Well over here in the UK diamorphine (heroin) is given to you when you're in extreme pain and morphine just won't cut it, and heroin is quite big here, especially in Scotland. 

EDIT: Usually drug addicts don't use their DOC because it's "cool" btw.  




 An opiate that doesn't kill you through respiratory depression, meaning you can go as high as you want without dying of respiratory failure. It doesn't cause nausea at any dose whatsoever, and at very, very large doses, is psychedelic and at very, very low doses feels a lot like Amphetamine without the comedown. 




 Well you do sound fucked... Hard to believe that there is 0 euphoria. 




 How much did you do? And what ROA? 




 Poppy Seed Tea. THAT IS ALL... But in all seriousness, OP, morphine is my favourite opiate, but I usually get 'Morphine Oral Solution' which has always worked for me. It is definitely more of a body high, but I always feel great on morphine, whether I get the oral solution or I bang that shit. 

 




 That's how aiming usually works in FPS's (besides recoil control). You aim, you shoot (and control recoil) and you kill... What are you trying to get at here? 
























 Can anyone make this into a T-Shirt? 




 Nice try, DEA. 




 3004 actually. 




 Dude, he's from England, he must know English the best.  




 Because nothing lasts forever. It's that simple, not even the universe will last forever.

 How can I send ice cream from Europe without it melting? 




 You wouldn't just automatically be immune to it but the blood transfusion will give you an insanely better chance at surviving.  




 You are a teenager, you are meant to be rebellious, not sit on reddit complaining that your PEERS are breaking the fucking school rules.  




 What type of Internship (like what job)?

Edit: Just saw that you said accounting as her job/internship, accountants earn quite a bit don't they? Maybe she's jealous. 




 Seems legit.  




 Alcohol never really even made me happy when I drank it, drugs like opiates, weed etc actually make me happier with my life, I'm starting to think the government literally just don't want any substance that makes you happier, legal.  




 Cannot be unseen. 




 You do realize that it was normal when I started and it FLUCTUATED to 161-65. 




 Okay, so I bet you've never had ping fluctuations in your life?  




 What? I didn't leave, I didn't even want to leave but my ping went past 160. Did you even read what I said? 




 I was playing cevo about 30 mins ago, I was playing alright and my team wasn't horrible and we got a lot of rounds on T side Nuke, so I had no incentive to leave but because my ping randomly kept fluctuating past 160 for some reason I got "kicked" and couldn't join back because my ping was staying way to high (most likely internet problems or something). So I waited it out and it was back to normal, joined a game until it started and then I got kicked because I was on a cool down because I apparently left the game? But I didn't, I got kicked because my ping kept fluctuating to quite literally 161-65... Just a minor complaint but I think it shouldn't be like that because sometimes you can't really control what your shitty internet does.

Was only banned for 30 mins so it's not too bad... [screenshot](http://gyazo.com/dc48505e62cd889e7e6e6b74255d010c) 




 Now I wanna play CS on acid. 

Good job btw, and as /u/saippuas said, make this into a sticka. 




 That name kinda de humanizes the victim in a way.  




 Maybe they would just fight until the other gets a BSOD.  




 It'll be like Terminator and there will be 3 people alive until all the robots get a bsod.  




 If two AI reach the state of constant victory in boxing, who would win? 




 I used the Sensei MLG (because I'm so MLG) for a few years but now I've upgraded to the zowie FK1, it's a lot lighter imo but the sensor is about 20x better.  




 Maybe people don't wanna say tit because it's extremely offensive and might trigger someone.  




 You said Dick, that's so sexist man. I'm soooo triggered, god.

 




 Are you an archaeologist because I need a big bone examining, Ms. Pretty Lady...
(   ) 




 They should've had the author as God, then everyone would still believe it.  




 Shut up, Jesus.  




 I have D so I'm not sure about C but the only thing that helps me is basically mild/moderate opiates, if I don't have them then I'm fucked mainly because if I don't I'll either be out at school and have to run home while trying not to shit myself, which is harder than it seems. 

I actually like being constipated (that's what opiates do to your GI tract) but it's probably A LOT different than the constipation from IBS-C.

I also get extreme stomach pains from time to time (they don't happen that often) that will literally floor me and make me scream in pain, even if I'm out in public.  




 Fuck you sky news. I'm from Scotland and I think we should have it all over the fucking news and every where else.  




 They still need improvements, some of the meds will literally knock you out for what feels like forever and make you gain a lot of weight that you previously wouldn't have put on. They can also make you feel like an emotionless zombie (but that CAN be due to the schizophrenia, but the meds also do that to you). So they do need to work them out a bit, and I've read recently that schizophrenia is most likely 8 different genetically distinct diseases, so maybe if that's true that'll open the gate for better medication.  




 I was at a psychiatric appointment earlier in the week (Tuesday) and I was basically describing OCD-like "symptoms" if you will, it's basically having to check things constantly until I know it's the way it is and ask someone certain things (not gonna go into detail about it) until I believe them, it's kinda like paranoia but more anxiety driven. I get a lot of intrusive thoughts, pretty much every day actually. I used to go for a shower about 6-7 times a day as a kid, but that died down a lot as I got older, and now it's completely opposite. Has anyone here ever noticed anything like this before? In the past or maybe right now or whatever? 




 It would be really nice if they came out with better meds in my life time. The meds right now kinda suck.  




 And child onset schizophrenia is soooo much more rarer than normal onset schizophrenia.  




 120-180mg to start. Not everyone can feel codeine because some people don't have the enzyme that processes it into morphine.  




 TOO SOON... 




 Is this minecraft? 




 Why not meth and crack? 




 Try crack.  




 I would've said... "Woah, you don't know me that well... yet ;)". 




 I usually get moderately depressed (sometimes just mildly) during the winter times, even though I love winter. 




 Can you share some of that cake? 




 Because that would so not be overpowering. /s

Also, RIP headphone users. 




 Isn't var not meant to go above 1 or 2? 




 You're always practising... Pugs, MM, Scrims, are all practice matches.  




 "I am currently MG2 now I can bash on MG1's" 




 Seasonal Depression is thought to be related to human hibernation that possibly happened WAAAAY back.  




 Usually when I use codeine it doesn't last longer than 2 hours. So I wait a couple of half life's to redose, seems to work.  




 If you make a habit out of codeine you can certainly have withdrawals... 




 Or you could just wait 3-6 hours before redosing.  




 Codeine varies between person to person because it's a pro drug. Some people lack a certain enzyme and don't get anything out of it, not even pain relief because their bodies can't properly process it into morphine (or not at all). Anyway, I would dose about 120-180mg (I would really start with around 120-128 though. 

DPH would help with nausea and it will also make the effects stronger (I personally used to like promethazine though, if you can get that). 

Have fun and don't make a habit out of it.  




 Tar is some dirty shit for sure.  




 Why would she cry over LSD? I've never understood that.  




 I can't full on tickle myself, but I can KINDA tickle myself.  




 Amsterdam has always been progressive when it comes to drugs. The rest of the world just needs to speed it up.  




 I personally think all drugs that have been highly researched (most opiates, most stimulants, weed, definitely MOST psychedelics etc) should be fully legal but of course regulated, kinda like alcohol. Except with drugs like opiates and stimulants you can only buy a certain amount every 2 days. 

Alcohol killed people and made them blind when it was illegal back in the 1900s, alcohol STILL kills people but not to the same extent. The reason heroin and the like kill people is because its prohibited. Imagine if heroin was legal, you would know the correct purity at all times, you would have clean needles (so the infection rate of HIV will plummet), there will be MUCH less crime because there will be no need for a black market for these drugs, there will be much less people in prison and there will be a lot more and better rehab/treatment facilities  around. The "war on drugs" is a massive joke and shouldn't still be around, god damn its been about 50 years. COME ON.  




 It has an animal reservoir. Disease with an animal reservoir cannot be fully eradicated. Unless of course you go about trying to immunise all of the animals that are suspected to be holders of ebola, but that would just be simply impossible. 

  




 You can't eradicate Ebola.  




 "Good morning little pussy!" 




 I grew up with a severely alcoholic dad, and a mildly alcoholic mother... You're a good man for divorcing her, alcoholism really hurts a kid.  




 Mustard works for heartburn?  




 I live in the UK and when I tell people that we use diamorphine in the hospitals (and I explain that it's pure heroin) they're shocked and don't believe me until they see it. People here are wakening up a little bit, but there are still a lot of people here that call heroin addicts things like, stupid, useless, smack heads etc. 




 HOLY SHIT, YOUR KID'S A PIRATE! 




 I love how Oxy was in there. I guess some people just don't know it's in the same category of drugs.  




 This guy just doesn't give a fuck any more.  









 That's true but it just seems so funny man, like you've got a bank of drugs in your house.  




 That is extremely overkill, lol.  




 You drunk bro?  




 I've never actually been to Aberdeen and I've lived near Glasgow all my life.  




 This is yet another plot from the Scottish to kill the English.  




 BUT SCOTLAND ISN'T THIRD WORLD, ARGHHHH. *stabbed*. 




 Damn, that's some dedication.  




 God dammit. Reddit comments need to be straight for this. YO REDDIT, THIS IS GAME BREAKING.  




 Trainspotting. Isn't about psychedelics and shit but it portrays the effects (kinda) of heroin and definitely nails the life style opiates bring.  




 Wait... I was supposed to sleep? 




 That's just called bad awareness, some people naturally have good/bad awareness.  




 This has to be just silver 1's, no nova with half a brain is like this.

Also, nice smurfing, I totally respect that. /s 




 Usually m4a1 but I changed when they made the price equal to try the m4a4 out again, but I keep forgetting to change it back to the a1.   




 It's not like MDMA...  




 I would rather go to someone that actually loves what they do rather than just some company that wants as much money as they can eat. You're welcome/Thank you.  




 This guy is basically just an independent store that builds gaming PC's for a living, and if it has problems they usually fix it for you (but it usually doesn't).  




 Rather them smoking mid than smoking meth.  




 We're all addicted here, muahahahah... 




 I give a list of components to some computer IT guys that I've known for a while (but not like a regular, just go there when I want a new PC built) and they build it for me (it's a small indie store).  




 Do they know what those 8 different disorders are? Asking out of interest.  




 *Stronk. 




 What rank are they? ESEA Invite? lol. 




 Why not both? 




 Yeah, it usually does. But for me it's as if it's there, but not really, if you get me? That's why I said it's a mix of outside voices and inner voices, it's a weird thing. I've also had inner monologue being corrupted by some jackasses, dunno what that's about though. 




 I don't know. Only tried Abilify (Sucks for me, made me worse), Amisulpride and now Seroquel, seroquel seems to be fine I guess.  




 What about weight gain on it? 




 No one knows what causes mental illness. No one seems to really care either. Where is our charity for schizophrenia research? If there is one, I hardly even hear of it.  




 Well, voices can come from both inside and outside I believe, but it's mainly a weird combo of both IME.  




 Who knows? No one seems to really know. Ask your doctor why your meds "work" or don't work, they have no clue... Why is psychiatry so behind when psychiatric illnesses can literally disable you as badly as not being able to walk?

Edit: Oh and happy christmas :) 




 It's pretty awesome, done it before. I think it's for the purpose of when you're at lan so you can identify your mouse or something.  




 Yeah, I do kinda feel my rank ups coming now since I've been ranking up somewhat fast lately, every 2-3 wins usually. The anticipation is great. 




 They really should make an official statement on how it exactly works, would help me understand why I rank up fast sometimes but slow other times, even though I either do better, or the same. 




 Thank you, my friend. 




 Basically, I don't fully understand how the ranking system works exactly. I thought it was based completely on the Elo system but then the guy from Valve said it's more "complex than that"... How does it exactly work? Is it based on wins/losses, performance or both? 




 Fucking, Supreme's... 




 I like it when the eating noises scrape against my inner ear and make them bleed... Feels good.  




 'MURRRICAAA 
























 What about acid? (low doses) 




 Temazepam is good. A lot of people actually say Xanax is the most recreational BENZO, but etizolam (pretty sure that's RC, if its not been regulated yet) is considered to be extremely recreational to some but I've heard some people don't feel anything from it but still black out somehow. I also think Midazolam is one of the more recreational benzos out there too but I believe it's pretty sedating and creates a lot of amnesia (they use it as a sort of pre anesthetic). I also believe Flunitrazepam is considered really, really recreational. Basically what I'm getting at is that it all depends on the person and what that person personally wants out of a drug and how they react to it. 

Edit: Benzos all in all aren't considered that recreational though, but alot of people obviously do find them recreational.  




 Promethazine is shit. I don't know why people like to take it with codeine. In large doses it blocks dopamine receptors and is a mild antipsychotic.  




 [Everyone please send them this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJGl0FQK9Ew) 




 Good question. 




 I don't think it's neurotoxic no. I believe oxycodone is derived from the thebaine part of opium. 




 Are you considering rape, sir? 




 You either missed out on a good dick suck or you dodged an STI/STD. 




 Fuck seroquel lol. I take that for the real reasons it's prescribed (schizophrenia) and that shit will knock you out no matter what, and if you have to wake up early for school or work it'll still be sedating as fuck. 




 I'm a certified reddit doctor and I think it's foot cancer.  




 It's just the oxy, this is what opiates do that's why people get addicted to things like heroin.  




 [that was dreadful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjnkV_tsjn0) 




 Because opiates are better than sex? 




 Medications have never stopped the cognition decline for me. It feels like I'm developing dyslexia and fucking dementia right now.  




 You're right, they do get rid of the positive symptoms for a while but they're never completely gone. Negative symptoms have probably interfered with my life more than the positive, I think. 




 Pretty much just described what basic methylphenidate is also, both have the same effects more or less except ritalin will only last around an hour.  




 Isn't there images released now that show him with his thumb practically blown off from the recoil of the shotgun? 




 There was quite a lot of heroin found in his blood when they found his body.  




 Nirvana is my favourite band and kurt cobain is probably my favourite person that I never knew personally. RIP brother. 




 Have to keep up the health while injecting some tar.  




 People say valium but I believe he was prescribed rohypnol. 




 WAIT, WHAT YEAR IS THIS? 




 Ethylphenidate, Methylphenidate and dexmethylphenidate are all my faves. 




 Not even... Wait, I'm smoking it right now. 




 I've been on old anti psychotics and new ones, and the current one I'm supposed to take is Seroquel and it feels like a fucking elephant is jumping on your back. 

The hard drugs I currently do are anything opiate.  




 Antipsychotics are completely shit, it's extremely hard to function on most of them, and then when you find a drug that's deemed "illegal" but helps you and you can still function, psychs will still say it'll make you worse.  




 [After a few months it just becomes as boring as breathing air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0cQSFCSENI) 




 INTP and pretty much do opiates exclusively.  




 Not read it yet but I like the title, you like Nirvana? 




 It's fucking Tuesday here. 




 Would probably be listed as a Schedule 1 movie.  




 Not even close. 




 Okay... /u/iCoy told you why scamming ruins the game and you just replied with, 100% irrelevant, as if you don't care that people get scammed (or you don't think its that bad that it can ruin a game) therefore you probably have scammed people in the past, think about it... 




 "Scammer spotted" means I molest children, you should work for the FBI.  




 Scammer spotted.  




 I remember when I was off for a year and came back, got 1 win and went back to MG2. 




 Maybe he doesn't get 144fps+ in other games? 




 Yeah, I use 1024x768 with -freq 75 but 1080p 60hz on my desktop, definitely makes the game a lot smoother.  




 I don't think I've ever actually seen 2G.  




 IV morphine is stronger than oral oxycodone, so if OP is willing to shoot some morphine up then it would be: Hydro, Morphine (oral), Oxycodone, Morphine (IV) etc.  




 Heroin WILL kill you, you don't even need to OD you will just magically DIE because you're using HEROIN, did you know that? We just use things in the hospital setting and sometimes outside the hospital that is around 90x stronger called fentanyl, BUT ITS HEROIN THAT DOES IT NOTHING ELSE BECAUSE ITS ILLEGAL. 

Edit: Quote: "Give an addict heroin and there is a chance they will die. Not because of fentanyl. But because they are an addict that is doing heroin."... This whole article is retarded.  




 Fuck her and fuck this generation that don't give a fuck about anyone else and are so fucking naturally narcissistic... I'm sorry for your loss, it would devastate me if someone I loved died.  




 Everyone on reddit is a pharmacologist or a dr.  




 Finally something creepy on here.

 I may be wrong or misunderstanding here but it said, "The SURVIVAL rate of the current outbreak is around 40%", not the fatality rate. 




 Holy shit... I thought I was crazy for the longest time, I do this too.  




 It's not got withdrawals anywhere close to heroin, but the psychological addiction is definitely comparable. 

Edit: Might be a stupid question but what exactly is poppers? The poppers I know about are like the solvent things, like "Isopropyl nitrite". 




 Opium has been used for thousands of years, it should be socially acceptable as much as alcohol but of course it's not because of the propaganda that's been fed to us for the last 50-60 years. Alcohol is such a dirty drug as well (even compared to opiates) because it acts on so much receptors, obviously mainly NMDA and GABA, but there quite a lot of receptors it acts on directly and indirectly. 

I don't hope that alcohol comes out of "social acceptance". I just hope that other drugs can enter social acceptance as well.  




 I have a retarded habit of replying to people before reading the whole thing, sorry, I get what you mean now. They thing is though that you would have to spike someone constantly for months and months before they got psychosis.  




 You could make a medication up? I know this isn't based on real drugs but a lot of movies, books etc. do it. You could get a collection of what people are saying here and mix them all and make one up based on real stuff? Just a thought.  




 Psychosis isn't fun...  




 And not just alcohol poisoning, it can actually kill you when you attempt to stop after a long time of usage. 




 Fentanyl patches are kinda weird, they have hot spots. Basically one part of the patch can have WAAAAY more than the rest of the patch, and the other patch will have a different "hot spot" than the last. I would cut them up really small and stick them on or something, without a really beafy tolerance there's a pretty big risk of overdosing. Don't fuck about man, fent is around 100x (if not more) potent than morphine.  




 Alcohol withdrawals don't just make you feel like you're dying, they can actually kill you, it can also cause a form of dementia... I never understand why alcohol is considered socially acceptable.  




 They sure as hell never look normal even when they get their alcohol. Must be a shitty life when you're addicted to it.  




 Beer shots, lol...  




 I wonder why alcoholics sit up and drink all night all day everyday for months and months, kinda like my dad. Are they no longer euphoric or are they still euphoric? I don't get it.  




 Yo doc, I got this growth on my groin.

Anyway, Abilify is also an antagonist of the 5-HT2A receptor.  




 I feel your pain. I'm not on any benzos currently but I'm on a moderate dose of seroquel (after trying a few other anti psychotics) shit will make you feel like you're just a body with no brain or emotion.  




 Hell, there's been studies out there that say nicotine can just be as addictive as things like cocaine and certain opiates.  




 Whats wrong with being weird? Much better than boring.  




 How so? Can you explain at all? 




 Meth isn't a dirty drug chemically, it's just the way it's made in those random shitty clandestine "labs". It's used in America as a treatment for severe ADHD and possibly severe obesity (if nothing else has worked). The name for it is Desoxyn.  




 Some people don't know shit about drugs and/or brain chemistry, you shouldn't hate on them for not knowing that stuff but instead you should just try and educate them.  




 I've never really had a comedown from tramadol, maybe a bit of a headache and nausea but thats it, it's not a stimulant though, it's an opioid with SNRI activity.  




 They're really good if you've been constipated for days or you need to stay awake for something, or at a party. Other than that, it's such a waste of your day due to the comedown.  




 For me it's methylphenidate (ritalin) when snorted. That shit also made me look for some powder on the carpet, like a crack head.  




 He could be a chemist and he makes really pure coke. /u/ex-ALT can you make me some coke bro? 




 Ritalin (methylphenidate) is insanely euphoric, especially with alcohol but that comedown made me think I had a brain hemorrhage.  




 You should do it like cocaine, snort lines every hour... This may be flawed.  




 Try normal methylphenidate, that comedown made me feel like my head was gonna explode. Good drug though. 




 Do people still think that you can get rid of drugs? We've been taking substances for thousands and thousands of years. 




 This is so fucked up, holy shit. His mind was literally gone.  




 It's weird that heroin and morphine are a little different, mainly because heroin really only works because it breaks down into morphine.  




 You should get that checked out.  




 Plugging isn't always that great. If you haven't shat in a while then it'll just go into the shit and not work. 




 Yeah I totally love having to have to shit 10x a day and probably need surgery in the next few years on my GI tract... /s 




 I wish I had a routine, just going day by day now bro. 




 Opiates don't really cause organ damage long term, and if they do it's extremely rare. Everyone thinks that heroin, morphine etc. cause liver damage, but that's untrue. Cigarettes are worse than opiates because they have a lot of strong carcinogens in them, which WILL eventually cause some sort of cancer, maybe in 10 years or maybe in 40 years of smoking, but it will happen. Opiates can cause your immune system to weaken, but not to the point of something like AIDS or anything, just minorly fuck up your immune system. 

Also, they reason he said it should be legalized is because it would decrease the amount of OD's, yeah there will still be people who intentionally overdose or just overdose accidentally, but it would decrease. 




 If your T levels were negative you'd be dead.  




 Doesn't every knife say 1337 though?  




 I wouldn't say it's charity work. These are our "athletes" if you will, they should get payed even if they don't win, just like in any sport, and this is a good idea for it.  




 It's not exactly CSGO-L paying players, it's just that a % of the bets go to the players. It's a really good idea.

 I've not posted here in a while because I've been doing pretty okay, not great not bad, about a 6-7/10 though. But I do have one big problem that I can't get over and that's pretty bad memory loss, I'd say it's gone from mild to moderate pretty fast (a few months) I'm not sure if this is related to schizophrenia, meds or some other health problem (definitely not aging because I'm not old enough for dementia). I'm currently on 150-200mg of seroquel. I get confused pretty regularly, but not soo often, I've forgotten things I've literally JUST done about 2 seconds ago (confirmed by family members), I'm forgetting what to write right now actually, I just don't know really what's going on or happening, but yet I do, it's literally like things will just not hold up in my head, I do something forget it, do something else forget it, It feels like I'm forgetting everything. Someone will tell me to do something and I'll forget they ever even told me to do that a few mins later. 

The worst part though Is I just generally feel really confused and as if I'm forgetful in the moment about everything... Can anyone tell me why this is? Is it schizophrenia, med related? Or something else?

I feel it's a lot more than mild forgetfulness, I just know I'm forgetting things really bad because other people are telling me in the moment, and confusion is really bothering me, i feel like I just can't remember most shit. 

Anyone help?  




 Just wondering, what exactly was it that you done? 




 Oxymorphone has the worst bio orally, it's like 10%. At least hydromorphone is like 30%.

 This is a competitive game. It's one of the biggest eSports titles. If we want to be taken seriously as a real sport there HAS to be rules/punishments and the tournaments aren't necessarily a gift, they're apart of the game because as I said, it's a big eSPORTS title.

 They also say that autism is "on the rise". When It's not really on the rise it's just that the diagnosis is much wider now than it was in say, the 80s. 




 I don't get them from the street anymore. I get real prescription stuff mainly because there's an abundance of them in my house because most of my family have prescriptions. 




 Imodium is an opiate that just doesn't cross the blood brain barrier and acts primarily in the gut, but the thing is, it either works really well, works too well or doesn't work at all. It doesn't feel consistent, but maybe that's just me.  




 I've never understood the argument that vaccines cause autism. If that was the case wouldn't most of the world have autism? 




 Hello everyone I'm new to this subreddit mainly because I didn't have much to post about. I have IBS-D (most likely, still need to do a little more tests but that's my diagnosis right now) and I get extreme relief from opiates, mainly morphine and codeine. The relief actually feels like a cure, when I take them I have no diarrhea whatsoever (mainly because opiates cause constipation but constipation for me is a relief), I still have chronic nausea and stomach cramps though. The only problem is that I'm not prescribed these meds, but they're easy to come by and make me able to function. If I try to come off them I would probably go to the bathroom around 8 times in 7 hours and I would have to take sleep meds to get any relief from that (if i didn't have any morphine or codeine). 

Anyway, my question is, is it possible to get prescribed these meds for this type of condition?  




 But they're still essentially the same as the other atypicals.  




 Antipsychotics will produce the opposite of euphoria.  




 I've never known anyone that's white to take offence to being called a "white boy" or a "cracker". Maybe if it's more complex racism but not one word.  




 Why the fuck is it that only white people can be racist? Can't black people be racist too? It's so fucking stupid, if I hear someone thats black call me a white boy or cracker I'm gonna play the race card because that's also racist. Also, why do black people get so offended when someones mildly racist to them? I don't get offended if someone's racist about white people. 

I'm not being racist if some idiot thinks that I am. If everyone wants equality (which I've always fully supported) then we should ALL get treated the same at the basic level.  




 I would've said, "Fuck you, you're racist too", to the teacher.  




 So what do you say if he wasn't american? What about a british person that's black? Do you also say African American? God damn, people are so dumb and stupidly sensitive when it comes to racism.  




 I've heard about the CBD recently. It apparently sounds good for negative symptoms as well, hopefully they finally try it out in a few years.  




 First horse burgers now deadly erection spiders, god dammit Tesco.  




 I was wondering that because the medications used for schizophrenia right now aren't exactly the best (albeit they are better than the very old style antipsychs), do you think they'll be new antipsychotics in the next 10-15 years, or are there already some in the making? 




 God dammit, she's a dumbass.  




 Could ebola not go endemic because of this outbreak (especially if it's not over soon)? 




 I think this is a very informative sub reddit. I like the posts here but I have a question... Who's serious? 




 Thanks, I've saved it so I'll read it a little bit later.  




 Thanks. I'll definitely do that.  




 So I haven't played minecraft since beta because I've just been playing other games basically and I've just started up a world and was wondering that there is a lot of changes that I don't particularly know about. Any tips and information anyone can give me about the new game? Remember the last time I played was mid beta. Thank you! 




 He looks so grungy. I like it. 




 If you could understand context you'd realize that I was being distant and just not dismissing him, I wasn't exactly trying to fully diagnose him it's called not being dismissive of someone.  




 Yeah it would be cheaper because amphetamine paste is just mix amphetamine salts like adderall but it's less pure. It's basically the stuff you got in the 70s and 80s. 




 Yeah it might not be your goal but if you had the option you would do it (if you were a sociopath) right? Also, look into narcissistic personality disorder or just narcissism (since you said you like talking about yourself). It co exists with antisocial disorders.   




 I have read up on the topic of a lot of personality disorders. Sociopaths usually have little to no emotion and empathy. They have little to no guilt for the wrong things they do and they think people are there to be exploited and oh, I don't watch TV either, that's so 15 years ago.  




 Alcohol is neurotoxic and CAN cause alcoholic brain disease and dementia. Alcohol is definitely worse for your brain and no, it's not different for a teen because you're just a different age not a different species. 




 [This is what he means.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity) 




 They were trying to plug it.  




 Why would there be a market for a less pure amphetamine? Adderall is basically just the same except it's more pure and you know exactly what you're getting.  




 I never used to get mad on opiates until I got addicted to them. 




 That doesn't make sense. Sociopaths usually don't recognize any fault within themselves and will only say they are if they can get something out of someone.  




 When I was taking ritalin I used to just snort the shit out of it. I would go up to 200-300mg in a day. Amazing drug while it lasts but when you come down it's metal as fuck.  




 I was even taking ritalin medically and I still felt the recreational effects initially.  




 Amphetamine is pretty recreational lol. 




 Why do we still have street amphetamine? Because doctors don't prescribe dexedrine or adderall as much as they do in the states so it doesn't get on the streets as much.  




 Yep, in the UK street amphetamine is speed. I've never actually heard or seen of anyone using meth in the UK.  




 Ants are gonna be Sched 1 soon.  




 Do you mean prozac and sertraline?  




 90c? That could cook my chicken. 




 I can't find EpicScale in my programdata, I uninstalled uTorrent. Is it possible I could have the miner still? 




 But why is it always in the Ritalin? /r/Conspiracy 




 I've been off them for a bit now and I'm fine. I'm more inward recently but that's about it.  




 My appetite isn't exactly great lately so I know I'm not over eating (well right now at least).  




 Holy shit, I'm on a vice article.  




 I've stopped taking my seroquel because it made me tired all day until it wore off 24 hours later (I took a controlled release version), but not only that but it made me gain 80-84 pounds (not just seroquel but the other anti psychotics I've been on in the past year). I've been off of it for just over a week (I know, not long at all) but my weight is still not back to normal, it's essentially still the same. I've been walking quite a lot (hard exercise is hard for me right now, just got bloods back saying that I've been pretty anemic and I have a stomach condition). I got a pedometer thing and It says I walk around 3-4 miles a day and I've also not been eating much, just lunch and dinner and maybe some chips, that's it. The only days I didn't walk much is when I got sick a few days ago but that was only for 2-3 days. I've not been losing any weight at all, I'm still between 235-238 pounds. Is there ANYTHING I can do? I've came off my anti psychotics because they're starting to just be a waste of time (yeah, yeah, I know, they "helped"), I walk quite a lot and don't eat more than 2,000 calories and at the most I eat around 2,500 calories. I've posted this here before and people didn't think it was possible, but yeah, whatever. I'm starting to lose it here, coming off anti psychs haven't helped (yet) and I walk and eat right and my weight still isn't coming off and my docs don't want to hear it. Is there anything I can do?

PS; If anyone doesn't believe I walk around 3-4 (maybe 5 at the very most) miles a day then I'll take a screenshot next time I'm out walking.  




 ##DID I DO IT? 




 One of my favourite movies. I even live in Scotland.  




 You're pretty much right. It's just an opiate that binds to the mu opiate receptors in the gut (just like any other opiate under the sun).  




 My dad is (was) an alcoholic and he's had to stop now mainly because he's developing a form of dementia that a lot of alcoholics get, luckily the thiamine has helped but it doesn't help everyone (he's not even 60). 




 I play CSGO (taking a massive break right now because it gets extremely boring) I'm a pretty high rank and I see what you're saying. Toxic players are so fucking stupid and annoying, I have one dude on my friends list who just rages because he dies (even if we win the game). 




 He seemed like he was actually bullying himself lol.  




 Tell them to fuck off (literally say, fuck off) and stop faking remorse, fucking losers. And PTSD from breaking up with a boyfriend? God damn, fuck that family they seem like a pathetic bunch of losers.  




 Have you seen a cirrhotic liver? Looks like a pickle. 




 Well alcohol can literally pickle your liver and give you a form of dementia, I would say its 9001x better.  




 Depends on how much you take and how much you drink.  




 I've got pretty bad "negative" symptoms (mainly not washing for days/weeks and not wanting to do anything other than sit in my room on my own) still but doctors NEVER ever take a look at it for some reason so I'm stuck not being able to fully function while no one really understands why and scold me for it.  




 It happens in the UK just not at the same rate as America. As /u/Fillyhaze said, the younger the doctor is in the UK (or Canada) the more likely they'll prescribe something, it happens much more often with psychiatrists in the UK than other doctors though. Psychs are often the most corrupt.  




 They're pretty much the same thing but certain people like to say psychopath or sociopath. I just got used to saying sociopath.
 




 Real narcissists (Narcissistic personality disorder, which most peoples parents in this sub reddit actually have) are also sociopaths, they can make anyone believe them or like them.  




 After reading a lot on this subreddit I've came to the conclusion that narcissists are so fucking stupid and self centered that they don't even deserve human interaction.  




 So they're literally committing crimes against humanity, in a way? 




 You should leave, really fast. You'll either crack and kill THEM or they'll end up hurting you or worse, kill you. They're extremely abusive and bad parents.  




 [This is how much receptors they act on. The ones that are blank for efficacy are basically antagonists](http://gyazo.com/f32f36ce833a74312e3b2498e2f2a45a)
6-7 are agonists partially, but most are antagonists. So it's definitely not just one or two receptors, so doctors that tell you that are probably just mistaken because they're not exactly pharmacists or pharmacologists.  




 Seroquel will calm you down a lot more. Heh heh. 




 If you don't mind me asking what autoimmune disease(s)? 




 She said that her sister thought it was in Japan.  




 People either never take enough codeine (180mg-120mg) or they can't metabolize it into a working drug because they don't have the enzyme or insufficient amount of the enzyme.  




 I didn't exactly say that he isn't damaging it, he's obviously mildly damaging it but the other dude said that he's "KILLING" his liver. I don't exactly think he's killing his liver with only 900mg over the recommended limit.  




 You're right, my mistake. When you're constantly studying this shit you often mistake an agonist for a releasing agent or a reuptake.  




 Was just about to say that lol.  




 I don't itch from opiates as much anymore. I used to scratch really bad but not that much anymore. Tolerance can play I role I believe.  




 best answer. 




 Every time I do CWE's I don't get as high. You should still do it OP, maybe you're not as dumb as me. 




 I wouldn't say he's KILLING his liver with 4.9g a day. 




 Money.  




 I've had ritalin controlled release that was just little balls that didn't have much wax or fillers and was really easy on my nose. Depends on what kind he has. If it's concetra then don't just crush it up and snort it, that's probably the worst for snorting.  




 Either way, benzo withdrawal can kill you. It's just like alcohol withdrawal but arguably not AS dangerous but it's still in that ballpark and should be treated with care. If he was my patient and he even called me all sorts of names and shit I would still taper him before just letting him go.  




 Oral ritalin doesn't really do much other than for therapeutic uses. Focalin and Ritalin are only really euphoric when snorted. So try again in 2 days and just snort them. Are they XR or IR? 




 God damn pot head.  




 It's so fucking weird. You're chilled out and happy but you're also mad as fuck at the same time. God damn opiates, not even... wait, I'm doing them right now. 




 No problemo. 




 Opiates make me happier but god damn my temper threshold is so fucking low.  




 20-100 hours and 36-200 hours (for the active metabolite) is the HALF life. So if you take 20mg, after around 36-200 hours (usually it's in between those times) will go down to 10mg in your system. When I was taking lorazepam I was very happy and social for a week later.  




 I'm pretty sure it is but not to the extent of heavy recreational use of course. Amphetamines use a lot of dopamine and serotonin and pretty much deplete these receptors (thats pretty much why you come down) and someone who takes them every day for a few years would definitely have some brain chemistry changes. 

I remember being on methylphenidate (ritalin) and I would have to take breaks every weekend just to EAT, so if someone is not eating enough and basically starving themselves due to no appetite could that also damage the brain? Because I know that korsakoffs syndrome is caused by a thiamine deficiency usually seen in alcohol but can happen because of malnutrition too. (Legit question, even if it seems dumb). 




 Xanax is pretty much the exact same except its stronger.

Edit: Yeah, don't freak yourself out of course but using benzos for a year at any dose (even theraputic) can cause seizures. It's DEFINITELY something to think about and have a friend with you incase it happens, you know, seizures aren't always deadly, seizures kill you usually by banging your head or having an injury when no one is around not by the seizure it's self. Honestly, seizures are the worst physically thing that can possibly happen but it doesn't mean it's set in stone. Just watch out for the mental stuff, you'll be cool though. 




 If you can survive benzo withdrawal - then you can survive anything

You're right. I've been through opiate withdrawal numerous times and it seems nothing like benzo withdrawal. Makes opiate withdrawal a walk in the park and that's saying something.  




 Stims (methylphenidate etc) never really made me feel warm and fuzzy inside (or maybe I was too speedy to realize lol), opiates do that.  




 Since that's what it was prescribed for you could have rebound symptoms of PTSD (not related to withdrawal, but withdrawal will make the anxiety worse for sure since that's part of the withdrawal syndrome). If it gets too bad I would definitely call the hospital, they'll give you a benzo if it's bad enough. Your doctor should NEVER have done this to you, with any psychiatric drug (ESPECIALLY benzos) you need to be tapered slowly off of them. 

Edit: Remember, you wont get every symptom thats listed on the wiki, that's just a list of possible symptoms. If anyone got all those symptoms they'd be effectively dead lol.  




 Yeah lol. 




 If you've been taking it for a year religiously then it is a concern for sure. [This will tell you all the withdrawal symptoms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine_withdrawal_syndrome). Seizures are pretty common with benzo withdrawal, it's kinda like alcohol withdrawal. 




 Yeah, they use them in hospital when someone comes in having a seizure.  




 Does he realize that benzo withdrawal can induce, seizures and kill you? Medical negligence. You should taper, yes but have someone with you incase you do seize or worse, nearly die.  




 Even if it is rare, it still happens. Rare =/= never ever happens.  




 It requires dropping out of elementary.  




 And they should be reminded every day that they DID kill someone.  




 Those dispatchers should have been charged with some sort of murder or manslaughter and sentenced to a minimum 21 years.  




 It's a phenothiazine, basically an old style anti psychotic kinda related to thorazine in a way. There are a few (mainly old I believe) antipsychotics out there with anticholinergic effects. It isn't accepted as an antipsychotic anymore since it's pretty bad at being one but it does have those properties, mainly mildy blocking some serotonin receptors and dopamine receptors.

I remember taking it to get to sleep a few times and I would have audio hallucinations and feel really confused. Thank god it's not used as an anti psychotic anymore.  




 The comments on YouTube by those fucking trolls really piss me off. We should shoot this operator in the head and ask her a bunch of questions for 6 mins before getting her help.  




 I would wait for sure. LSD and Psilocybin act on serotonin, particularly 5-HT2A (which is a serotonin receptor). 




 Sexy.  




 Someone with severe anxiety or even just moderate anxiety and they take a benzo they'll definitely feel a "high" but the high will just be no anxiety. Maybe most people in our society feel pretty anxious and when they take benzos they have absolutely no anxiety and put it down as a "high"? Who knows.  
























 No problem. 




 They've not yet become self aware, no. 




 It's been kinda progressive for me but it hit full blown(ish) suddenly a few days ago. And it pretty much feels like I'm an empty shell, like nothing really matters anymore. 




 That's what I mean by that it's kinda weird. Plus, it's an RC they can range in quality and stuff. I've heard of stories of people not feeling anything from a large doses but their friends black out. Have you tried any other benzo or benzo-like drug? Maybe try a different one. 




 Anyone else who comes on this post, I have a question; Should I see my psychiatrist? Even though every time I tell her about negative symptoms she pretty much ignores me and moves on to a different subject. 




 I'm starting to think that it's the illness and the meds just make it 10x worse, because I've not been on medications for around 2months and my apathy has just started to actually come back... Weird.

 




 I can also completely relate to the 0 sex drive. My sex drive went from pretty normal to pretty much -100 out of 100. I still don't know for sure if it's medications that causes it, because I mean, I've been off meds for around the same time as you (by myself, docs never, ever take me off meds). Schizophrenia can cause you to have apathy I guess but I'm really hesitant to go back on meds because they make that part worse. Also, having suicidal thoughts because of lack of a sex drive isn't good, you should see a psychologist (they can help better with that on a psychological level than a psychiatrist can, a psychiatrist are just licensed drug dealers imo)... When I don't have a sex drive I just think of it like, well, at least I don't have that burden anymore, even though it's a bad thing, if you understand? I'm pretty sure lack of a sex drive is because when your emotions are extreme lowered (apathy) you can't really connect with anyone else, could also be due to anhedonia which accompanies apathy nearly all the time. 

I hope you eventually start to get better.  




 I'm pretty sure etizolam is good for anxiety (although it is an RC "benzo", it's not exactly a benzo but it's extremely, extremely close).

Anyway, OP, I'm not all that knowledgable about etizolam but I heard that it's pretty good for anxiety, but I've also heard that it's kinda weird and can be heavily sedating and cause black outs with small doses to it's kinda hard to dose with it for anxiety... I think everyone's different with this particular drug (kinda like every other drug, I know, but this one seems to react differently with everyone).

Sedation - In terms of energy level alterations, Etizolam is extremely sedating and often results in an overwhelmingly lethargic state - Got this from [here.](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Etizolam).
So yeah as enigmaticdoge said, either stick with it until you build a tolerance or try a different benzo.

Edit: deleted because I accidentaly replied to enigmaticdoge. 




 No, I don't think I had a very big interest on the government trying to wipe out everything on Earth. But the lead up to the big "delusion" I had obsessions about it, I guess. 




 Can I meet you there? I don't have any friends in hell, I'll be new there. 




 I made a post not too long ago about how I was dealing with a shit ton of emotions but I just couldn't really express them even though I wanted to, so now I'm back and well, I don't feel anything. I should probably see my psych but I think she's still away sick. It's kinda like some part in my brain where emotions are kept was just swept clean, like there's nothing really there anymore. I mean, I still have feelings but they're extremely died down, for example; on a scale from 1 - 100 my emotions right now are about 6-12 (at the highest) and half of those at the lowest (3-6). I haven't been on medication for about 2 months now I think, dunno if it's that but if it is then, whatever, meds make this 10x worse.

It feels like I might be posting here like a diary, maybe no one noticed because my post are far and few between but whatever, have a nice day everyone.  




 4 grams CAN be lethal, yeah, sure (I still go with 127-130 per kg though). I was just saying that he didn't take anywhere near 4 grams, that's all. 

Edit: wrong numbers, sorry. 




 I fucking love Amsterdam. 




 Doing drugs as a hobby is the worst thing you could do, seriously, take it from me... For me for example, if I don't get any morphine I will seriously just go out and try and do random shit that would get me into a lot of trouble just because I was insanely bored (even if I was in WD's). If I couldn't get some morphine for even just one day, I would go out with friends and not come home for days and when I was out of that bender my friends would be magically gone, they went home days ago. Basically what I'm trying to say is that having drugs as a HOBBY is seriously self destructive because once you don't have that drug you will do anything to alleviate the boredom eventually. Not only that but doing drugs like MDMA that much will damage your brain, and don't even get me started on heroin, that's just not a road you want to take.

Being clean is a good thing you know... Yeah, yeah, I know being sober is really fucking boring but eventually you will have a hobby and build a routine out of that hobby and you'll eventually start to like life again. It takes time, maybe try a program like 12 steps (just keep in mind that it doesn't work for everyone), and/or maybe therapy. But yeah, even if sobriety is boring as shit, it's better than being self destructive and building your fun around drugs, because they don't last forever. 




 I wasn't saying anything about him fainting. The guy above me said that 4g is deadly, because he probably thought 400mg was 4g for some bizarre reason, so I corrected him. 




 The daily mail are just a bunch of mentally challenged people pretending to be smart. 




 I find the euphoria from methylphenidate to be like a 7.5 for 1 hour then it's all downhill from there. 




 He didn't take anywhere near 4 grams of caffeine though, or am I missing something? 




 Do they use Desoxyn in Europe (including the UK) because I've never heard of that outside of the US. It's mainly Amphetamine and Ritalin for ADHD and severe obesity. 




 Opiates won't exactly "kill your appetite" unless you use it chronically. The only reason it reduces appetite is because it slows down gastro-motility (and cause gastroparesis in some cases) and they also reduce physical hunger in the same way that they reduce pain. But I can say from experience that opiates won't kill your appetite like stimulants do, they might reduce it a bit but you will still feel hungry but just a little less frequently, and using drugs like this to lose weight is not only unhealthy but unsustainable.  




 That's great that you've been clean for 3 months, may I ask what drug(s) you were trying to stay clean from? Anyway, like the others have said, find a hobby, do something that's packed with adrenaline. 




 That's probably why I have severe trust issues and have to see a psychologist. 




 Thanks, mate, and yes the books are good. They have a great Scottish vocab (which is where I'm from). 




 [Yes, super saiyans are real.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xA0ZHEwU2Q) 




 Adderall is pretty hard but normal street amphetamine is pretty easy to get ahold of, and I like methylphenidate better anyways for some reason. 




 Don't ruin the dream, the dream will live on. Also I'm pretty sure all the Methylphenidate based drugs are on a 12 month ban. That apparently includes, Ethylphenidate, isopropylphenidate, propylphenidate, 3,4-CTMP, HDMP-28. 




 And it's not sustainable, they'll find out eventually (even if they're not overly suspicious). 




 Damn, your post didn't come up when I was typing that. Thanks, I'll read it. 




 Just get some Ritalin and drink alcohol. Ritalin is super easy to get in the UK. 




 I like to set people on fire too, don't you?  




 That little kid must've been like, "IS ANYTHING REAL ANYMORE?". 




 They don't for me. I have heard about that though, I've also heard that stimulants like meth also do that, they don't for me though. I still like chips and stuff over sweets. I've heard (on the internet) that opiates can almost put you in a hypoglycemic state, and that opiates make people have a reduce acute insulin response, so maybe that's why (but that's just speculation I think, feel free to do more research on that). I don't think it's anything to worry about though. 




 I'll suck yo dick man. 




 I have a pretty chronic, annoying and sometimes painful gastrointestinal disease (or just stomach, we don't know yet) that's not been fully diagnosed yet. It leaves me with low appetite, constantly shitting, (chronic) nausea, and feeling bloated after small amounts of food for hours. I feel tired, miserable and helpless but then you get these people that think they know how to cure it, even though doctors don't even know what the fuck it is (yet), or they tell me WHY I have it and somehow I end up with all the blame like I wanted this or something. Yes, because I totally wanted to become chronically ill. It's also super, super immoral to tell someone that they caused their disease, or that they can cure it with just 29.99 A MONTH, just fuck off you morons... If I could cure my disease on some stupid diet then I would do it but I have more sense than to hand over my fucking money to some low lifes that just want to make a few bucks on someone elses misfortune. 

(FUCK YOUUUUUUU ALL) 




 They actually don't usually lose intelligence, we might just find it harder to speak and get caught up on words and stuff but we do not lose intelligence.  




 They're all good.  




 Some of the stuff I'm seeing in the comments really disgust me. Kurt and Layne were both great, I personally loved Kurt more because I felt a connection to his lyrics, but can everyone stop acting like such immature little babies? Both were great, RIP to both.  




 OMG MY MOMMY SAW THAT... 




 I can't even imagine what life would be like without a washing machine. I'd have to hand wash my clothes, you're right, washing machines are pretty important.  




 It's Topiramate.  




 I think so, it's at least similar.  




 Yeah, at such a low activity that it probably wont have any interactions.  




 Actually, I'm starting to lose a bunch of weight which I'm hoping will make me feel better. 




 This should get upvotes because it's fucking hilarious.  




 Yes, he "shot himself". 




 And even if he was, diamorphine is definitely not OTC.  




 So, I don't think I've actually made a dedicated post on here, I usually just leave comments but I've been thinking about something lately and thats self-esteem, confidence etc. whatever you want to call it. 

To start off, I'm an opiate addict (morphine and a few others) and I started off like most opiate addicts, pain. Anyway, other than opiates I do take stimulants when I'm out with people to basically give me a sense of self confidence and obviously self-esteem, although it's chemically induced, opiates also give me this alien feeling of "confidence" that I've sadly never had in my life. I've tried therapy and gave up because it never did anything for me, I mean, talking about stuff obviously helps but I can do that to anyone without having to set up an appointment or pay money but the actual therapy itself does nothing. Drugs on the other hand, although it's considered "false", does help, they do give me self-esteem and confidence. I don't just have a low self-esteem, I have what you considered a shattered self esteem, when I'm sober I don't feel worthy of anyone elses care... I would rather do therapy if it worked, but sadly it doesn't, the only thing that works are opiates and stimulants.

So to my question, is it possible for someone to never have self confidence sober? As in, is it possible for therapy to never work and for people to have to have a chemically induced confidence and esteem?

If this sounds like rambling, I'm sorry. 
 




 ...

That's all I can say to this. 




 What the fuck? Yeah, and while you're at it eat some tea. 




 I never understood why. I always prefer opiates.  




 I just clicked the context button on reddit, am I doing it right? 




 So you should've said... "Test it AND buy rocks", not or. 




 Bu... But drugs are bad.

 Renton is a reference to the main character in trainspotting, haha. I've been asked if it was a reference to Renton, WA... At least Washington is my favourite state. 




 Tramadol is strange. For some people it's their DOC and then there's others exactly like you. Probably because of the SNRI activity. I've tried poppy seed tea, but I can never find any that's not really washed.  




 How can someone say "the good cancer", since when is ANY cancer good? 




 I find it extremely hard to express emotions to other people, lately I've been talking to an ex (and we both still have feelings for each other) and I find it difficult to say what I'm feeling to her unless I get drunk. I don't think this has anything to do with schizophrenia (or maybe it does, I don't know) but I post here anyway because its one of the only subreddits to do with mental illness that isn't overrun by attention seekers. Anyway, I don't know why I can't express any emotion to anyone, all I do is huff and puff so that they know something is wrong, and then when they ask me, I don't know how to put it into words. Does anyone else get this problem? 




 I think you actually can in Canada, no harm in trying I suppose.  




 What don't you like about it? 




 Okayy? That doesn't mean he won't have a copy of the enzyme, I'm guessing you're talking about CYP2D6.  




 I always feel proud that Gordon Ramsay used to live like 5 mins away from me. 




 I'm pretty sure the 'thebaine' is pretty stimulating, hence why oxycodone is more stimulating than the morphine derived drugs, like heroin. So if vaping it reduces the morphine then you will feel more of the 'thebaine', I'm guessing.  




 "He was searching for whatever made him feel like he wasn't alone"... Speaks to me more than anything, especially right now.

 The main alkaloid in opium that produces effects is the morphine, of course it has codeine, thebaine etc. but it's pretty much the morphine.  




 I mean, at least we would have a real diet pill for once if we legalized adderall. 




 There's never anyway to be 100% sure.  




 Weed, Cocaine... Same difference.

/s - for everyone that doesn't get sarcasm over the internet. 




 Mixing depressants, especially alcohol and opiates is a VERY bad idea, trust me. 




 I bet the last thing on his mind is going crazy again.  




 The reason I don't want to go back on meds is because they make me feel even lower, I have a history of depression as well and I think I'm having some sort of episode of it, which in return might be producing psychotic effects. I don't wanna go back on meds when I'm depressed, mainly because I don't think it'll help the way I'm feeling. I don't even have any antidepressants and my psychiatrist is off sick. This may seem sad and stupid but this "depression" may have been triggered by a girl I still love(?), I broke up with her a few months ago and we've recently started to kinda see each other on the side again (and she's said she still "loves" me), the thing is, I don't want to see her just on the side. I can't express what I feel, so I just bottle it all up, when I try to say how I feel I just come out with a bunch of words that don't make sense and stutter and stumble all over the place. I don't know why I'm telling this to someone over the internet, but I don't really have anyone else.

The trigger for my "depression" (which in return has triggered some symptoms of schizophrenia) may seem stupid, but I feel like killing myself but I don't know how to tell anyone.

Sorry for a late reply. 




 Welcome to reddit buddy. 




 Same difference.  




 Can you see through the chairs? 




 God dammit, evanallmighty. 




 I always knew pharmacists were druggies.  




 At least he didn't go from nothing to like, fent. 




 So, I've been off my medication for a month or so now and some shit happened that really got to me, needless to say I can feel pretty depressed (even though I can't feel anything, I just know I feel like complete shit), I can't think, like all my thoughts are fuzzy, I don't know. I just can't think. I feel like I might be relapsing, and even going back into a depressive state but I don't know how to tell anyone at all, I feel stuck, like my thoughts are screaming for help but I can't do anything. 

Thank you, just needed to get that out there (even if it seemed like nothing and even if it made no sense).  




 Any nirvana song.  




 The only dealer is a pharmacist.  




 Sir, are you high right now?
 




 Medication can even make negative symptoms a lot worse. Including the flat affect and avolition.  




 And this kids, is why you never do meth.  




 I've had dreams where I take crack (never done crack but I think I wanted to at that point), and morphine because well, I'm addicted to opiates. I also found MDMA in a dream at one point too, but I never done it in the dream. 

I don't really want to do crack anymore though, lost that interest a while ago.  




 Lol, then why comment? 




 Maybe, just maybe, you just THINK you're making the right choices when drunk? 




 No, it will just give you severe autism.  




 Depends. I've been just given antipsychotics, and lorazepam (when I was inpatient).  




 They're pretty much just injecting morphine mainly, so it shouldn't be that bad.  




 Harming pets is usually a psychopathy thing, right? 




 She sounds spoiled as fuck. Why does a 12 year old have a phone anyway? What does a 12 year old exactly need a phone for? If this was me I would've flipped my shit and she probably wouldn't be here right now, so good job for keeping calm.  




 Two and a half men was good until they got rid of Charlie Sheen.  




 Opiates aren't unsafe to take if you're schizophrenic. They actually have antipsychotic-like effects. 




 People mainly want to go on a suicide mission to mars because they don't think that Earth has anything for them, they may even think they failed on Earth so much that they would rather die on mars. It's actually quite sad, but I don't think they're all idiots.  




 Your name is extremely accurate.  




 Eh, whatever. I still think we COULD make it to mars in the next 30 years though.  




 So I guess an off brand tylenol will get me suspended for a year because it might look like a prescribed opiate? 




 You're missing out bro, you're missing out. Pill binder is strong shit. 




 And it should be on every official (police, paramedics, firefighters even etc).  




 It's hard losing someone but it's even harder losing someone to heroin or any drug for that matter. I'm sorry for your loss, and I know it's cliche but it isn't your fault. I bet he was a good dude. Remember, try and celebrate his life and not his death.
