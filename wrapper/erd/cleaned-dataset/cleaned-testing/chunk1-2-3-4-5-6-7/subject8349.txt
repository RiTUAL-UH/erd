 I believe there are thousands, maybe millions of people who you could be extremely happy with and consider them your "soulmate". You may find a "soulmate" but keep in mind there are lots and lots of others who could make you as happy, or even happier than yours. You're with yours mainly because of where you live and have been to.  




 Maybe a cologne that isn't available in Europe (the new Old Spice ones, for example, aren't available here in Europe).  




 Avoiding to borrow things to people. I'm sure everyone would say I'm selfish, but I'm not lending you my expensive smartphone so you can drop it or check my personal text messages.  




 Girls with blue eyes. 




 English. I didn't like it as I didn't understand it, and the fact most PC games and movies were in English didn't help. Now I prefer it over my first language ^^

 Who's Razor1911's cracker in real life. 




 I've cracked a few software protections. 




 How he always tries to please me and my sister, despite the fact he doesn't make that much money and rarely gets anything new to himself. 




 I'm from Portugal, and it's hard to find something I like here. We've got beaches, (usually) sunny weather and a cuisine that pleases many foreigners, but unfortunately I don't like any of that. I'd much rather life in a cold, snowy place like the Scandinavian countries or Canada. Oh well, maybe one day :)  




 Back when I first got Internet on my computer, I was infected by several trojans. One of them was a fake antivirus software which claimed it could disinfect my PC if I purchased it. I decided to format the PC instead. Ha, bad old times :) 




 I wish they had been more strict about my behavior. I was a stupid "rebel" during Elementary school, without realizing it at the time. I also was rude to many adults then. My parent's punished me but it wasn't enough. Is that a weird thing to say? 




 When I was a kid, I ran to the road not knowing there was a car passing. My neighbor actually closed her eyes as she thought I was gonna be ran over. 
The other time was also when I was a kid, my mom was about to give me some medicine that was made for adults and could potentially kill me. Thankfully, she always reads the whole paper that came with it, and returned it to the pharmacy, where it had been recommended. The pharmacist got really nervous and apologized a lot. 




 Not being down-to-earth. 




 Change BF4 servers' maximum ping to 20ms. 




 Don't feel too bad about that, man. I also have the "chest hole" thing, although it's not THAT bad, and so does a popular friend of mine. In the locker room once in a while other guys have fun poking at them (no homo) :p 




 Man, there's gotta be a great story behind that. 




 When my puberty began I didn't know I had to wear deodorant (most people my age already did), so...  




 I went to the bathroom and there was a green rag on the bottom of my shower. After looking at it, I get progressively scared and eventually wake up. WTF. 




 People who complain about how they have bad grades because of their teachers. There are cases when teachers are more demanding and harder on students, but in most cases they don't have good grades because they don't work for it, or their studying method needs optimization. I'm not that smart, people always seem to figure out how to solve math problems before I do and store more information than I am able to, but I usually have either the same or better grades than them, because I study more and harder than them. 




 Make all states allow guns and abortion, throttle non-white immigration and make sure there are more people speaking English rather than Spanish. 




 Multiculturalism. 




 Being pretty outside (cute face, blue eyes are a huge plus for me) and being honest, sweet and polite.  




 Run to the electronics store and steal all the big-ass TVs, 700$ smartphones and consoles I possibly could. 




 lel u dont kno mah stori, u dont kno me et all, dunt judje me 




 Counter Strike (game) and Game of Thrones (TV series). Nearly everyone I know loves them but I prefer Battlefield and TV series which plot occurs in the current days. 




 The last episode of "Lost". 




 What happened after that? 




 I've cracked a few software products. It's not worth mentioning to anyone in real life as people have no interest in it. 




 My hair is thick and it has two colors: black and light brown. Some people think I dye my hair, others think I spilled hydrogen peroxide on it :p 




 Post pics please :)
Are they blue? 




 Damn Desmond, forgot to push the button :/ 




 Yeah, sure looks like it :/ 
























 The countries with the highest percentages of white people tend to be the most developed and have better quality of life and gender equality.

 And then you found out it was on ThePirateBay? :P 









 The Internet as we now know it. I find it amazing we can send a message to the other side of the world in less than 1 second, store thousands and thousands of photos when we once need countless albums... 




 Visiting London for 6 days with my classmates/friends. It'll be next year, and of course I'm going. 




 Would people in Sweden consider someone white if they have black hair, dark brown eyes and slightly tanned skin? 




 CyberGhost is great as well, and they offer a free version. Premium is worth it, though. 




 Most brands are worth the money unless they're incredibly overpriced (like Apple, for instance). Some generic brands are good enough, but you never have the guarantee you're getting a quality product. Two things from these brands you should avoid are shower gel and toothpaste. 




 If so, tell me a bit about your experience. I'm a newbie that cracks simple programs for entertainment. 




 Ignite. 




 North 




 Crysis 3. I enjoyed the alpha/beta multiplayer, so I bought the full game. 1st mistake was buying it on a local retail store instead of some online key store. 2nd mistake was buying it at all :) 




 My Portuguese teacher wanted my to help her make a PowerPoint presentation of some poems we were forced to write. I don't get paid anything in the first place, needless to say I refused :) 




 A friend's gameboy, when I was like 5 years old or so. I freaked out when I saw it stopped working. The guarantee wouldn't cover it, so my parents ended up paying either for the repairs or for a new one (can't remember). 




 They saved money on toilet paper to buy all that expensive cool stuff ^^ 




 I didn't win the "genetic lottery" at all. I have dark brown eyes, black hair, big nose, big lips considering that I'm white (or at least I think I am), wide teeth that have gone yellow-ish even though I never had teeth problems and always washed them, and tanned skin. I would love to have light blue eyes, small nose, normal-sized lips, normal white teeth and fair skin. The only thing I like is being tall, actually. 




 No. There are no real movies in 4k yet, many TV channels still broadcast in 720p and the price of a 4k TV is ridiculous. By the time 4k gets popular, they will be 1/2 or 1/3 of their current price. As someone suggested, a 4k monitor might make a difference, though. 4k gaming is great, and a huge monitor can be great if you usually have many windows opened. 




 Wait a day before spending money on something you've just seen and are really excited about. I guarantee that in many cases the "excitement" just goes away and you save some money. 




 I never quite knew how to socialize, specially with people I didn't know. The older ones in the parties always found something to make fun of me, and I was never seen as an equal to other people in the party. 




 Just the way I style it, I guess.

 MOIST MOIST MOIST MOIST MOIST MOIST MOIST 




 I have this memory of looking up in crib and seeing those crib toys. Probably a fake memory though. 




 Besides of the basic info about yourself, try to memorize the names of new people you just met. If you meet them again, they'll feel nice as they were remembered, and if you need anything from them you're more likely to get it. 




 Gravity. It was so boring and pointless (in my opinion). If there are guys who like it, I recommend checking their testosterone levels. 




 Meeting a tourist girl around my age. I create various scenarios and daydream.   




 I hate them, I'd much rather date a flat chick. Having fake breasts means you're not confident about yourself to the point you wanna "get a masK".

 Oh come on, y'all just don't want to admit the 50$ you paid for a Sims 3 expansion that should have already been in the main game is totally worth it. DON'T FORGET THE BF4 BATTLEPACKS. 




 Ha, just imagine fingering a chick after that :P 









 You can buy cheap refill kits on eBay. Or actual full cartridges, if you don't like to get your hands dirty. 




 I bought the Fiji stick on eBay as it isn't available in my country, and it's not that great. Smells like a cleaning product, and stains (not permanently, but still) my dark t-shirts. I use either Wolfthorn or Danger Time, both spray. 




 8 hours, post it! :) 




 Not having blue eyes.

 A few years ago, I woke up (only an hour or two after going to bed, so I guess it was a light sleep) and started crying a lot. To this day, I have no idea what I was crying about. WTF 




 I guess he didn't try "hey bby, wnt sum fuk" :P

 Camel toe 




 To chew with my mouth close. My parents NEVER told me. I remember once in elementary school I was eating cookies when some girl said "Ewwwww, he's chewing!" and I had no idea what I was doing wrong. 




 Pretty much all "old" technology. Old PCs, old phones, old televisions, Walkman CD players, old video games... technology improved a lot in the last decade, but I still prefer the old tech. 




 How sharks don't eat underwater fiber cables. 




 You reverse engineer software to understand how it works, and can then do stuff like bypassing the copy protection, analyzing its malicious behavior (if it's a malware) or fix it. 

When I didn't know anything at all about reversing, I started reading [these](http://thelegendofrandom.com/blog/sample-page) tutorials. The first ones will introduce you to reverse engineering/cracking, and teach you to use the (main) tool to crack software, called a Disassembler. A Disassembler converts binary/hexadecimal code to instructions of Assembly code.

You see, you can't easily "edit" an .exe. After the guys who make a software program it, they compile it to the .exe, and it's all converted to Assembly code. Assembly code is incredibly confusing and no one in 2014 still programs in it, it's really only used in reversing. [Here's](http://www.ollydbg.de/Pics/OllyDbg2.gif)  what it looks like. I know it looks like hell, but those tutorials I mentioned will explain the basics. At some point, though, you'll want to learn Assembly to make sense of ALL of it.

The disassembler you'll be using is called OllyDBG, the one in that picture. It's included in the tutorials, as everything you possibly need. With it you can see that Assembly code that makes-up programs, see the text strings they have, etc.

They start by teaching you how to crack simple software known as "Crackmes". After a while, easy commercial software will be included, so you can practice on real targets.

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to crack simple commercial software, although this can be reeaaaly time consuming. Please note cracking DRM like Origin, Steam and Battle.net is much harder than the targets you'll be cracking, and you might only be able to do this after years of reversing.

[Tuts4you](https://forum.tuts4you.com) is a community of reversers who's always glad to help you. One rule, though, is to NEVER give info about what software you're trying to crack. 

So here's the more in depth explanation :)
Cheers!
 




 They are, actually :P  in simple protections, at least 




 See [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2c8kns/whats_the_most_interesting_underrated_hobby/cjd3m33) post I made. 




 Ha, it is indeed. I've spent 15+ hours trying to patch an unpacked VisualBasic program, but still can't. By going deeper into the calls before the conditional jumps that decide *goodboy* or *badboy*, I couldn't find the place where the serial verification is done at startup, and that can get frustrating.  




 Not until now. Thanks for the heads up, it's an interesting read :) 




 I don't think it's legal, but as long as you make sure the software doesn't connect to the Internet, and don't upload it anywhere, you should be fine. I recommend [these](http://thelegendofrandom.com/blog/sample-page) absolute begginer tutorials. If you have questions about stuff, there's [this](https://forum.tuts4you.com/) forum with tons of people who are into reversing software. 




 Oh... I was referring to DRM cracking :P

 I'd save half of it. Half of the remaining 12,500$ would be to help pay my parents' debt, and the other half to spend on PC upgrades, new phone and clothes (it's 6250$, so it would be enough for all that).  




 You sir, are a lucky bastard.

 VPN needed? 




 I'm using the v3 crack by Team 3DM. The game only crashes when there's something that involves a menu or a loading screen, like traveling, selecting seems to move to your lot, etc. Just save the game often and you should be fine.  




 *cough* Sniper Elite 3 *cough* 




 No surprise. These days, the only thing a game needs to sell is a good marketing campaign to get the hype out there. And if you add a recognized series name to it, bam, you're rich. 




 Alright then. I don't see the day people will buy a long awaited game, try to play it and surprise surprise... "Server is down. Pls wait a few hours. Maybe days" / "Seems like your internet dropped. Game stopped. Sucks for you, usually playing games is what you do in these situations lol". 




 You're comparing Origin to an always online DRM. Origin is NOT an always online DRM. You need an Internet connection to activate a game, and that's it. Maybe people will change their opinion on Origin as it might bring those sales you're talking about. But that won't happen for always online DRM, because it causes the problems I mentioned in the other post. I have absolutely no idea why you say Steam can bring any optimization to a game. Dude, SteamCEG is known for actually decreasing the performance (most DRMs do this to some point, but they certainly never improve it). 




 Yes, I like the way you think, Mr. EA's CEO. Take a sh!t on paying costumers by making a singleplayer game dependent on a stable server connection. And yeah, the online DRM totally worked with Simcity. Everyone could play the game when it was released, and EA got so much love for it. Just like Ubisoft did with their always online DRM a few years ago. Last, but not least, a new study showed that games with aggressive DRM usually sell more. Take a look at Sims 3, for example, it had an uncrackable DRM (CD checks, lol) and thanks to that it sold 10 million units. 




 The crash problem is better now, but still present. It seems to occur in loading screens, not the game per se. It crashed to desktop like 5 times before I could get a Sim to move into my house. SKIDROW didn't release any crack btw. The crack was done by team 3DM. 




 Battlefield 4 




 im a broy btw ;) 




 Sounds like a keeper 




 I go to the bathroom and there's a green rag on the floor of my shower. I get increasingly scared, until everything gets dark and I wake up. 




 Yeah, it was much more likely hacking. The lesson to learn here is that not even a 'secure' cloud service from a reliable company like Apple is safe. Don't take noods. Or if you do, encrypt them in RSA 2048 :) 




 Ignore all these trolls, they're just jealous of your PC. Most of these guys still have a Pentium III and a 6600GT. You can easily play this game on High @1080p, but that CPU would be kind of a bottleneck. For Ultra, you should get a Pentium IV. 512MB of RAM is enough for today's gaming, but keep an eye out for BF5, as it might require 1GB. 




 Hardline is far from an alternative to BF4. It's not too late at all to get Premium, but if you really don't want it, buy Dragon Teeth. Great balance between infantry and vehicles. 




 It's not impressive at all. The guy who killed you just needs to lock at the vehicle, shoot it a little bit to the left/right and after 2/3 shots you're dead. I've done this a lot from the Skyscraper in Siege of Shangai to snipers in other buildings and it's so easy. 




 Optimize my game's graphical options. GeforceExperience my ass. 




 It's not THAT bad, if you're know where to buy. Like, Premium in the US is being sold for 39.99$, and 39.99 in Europe. HOWEVER, if you buy them in a trustworthy cdkey store like G2A, it's actually ~40$ that get converted to ~30. That's how I got my Premium, and so far, haven't had any problems. 




 I payed 60 for a retail copy at launch and barely played it back then. Oh well :p 




 I'm glad you agreed to never be creative again before you ran out of time :) 




 I avoid using the color green. 




 "Big lips for a white guy"  - I'm white. 




 I have:

-No facial hair, except on my chin
-Big lips for a white guy

 I call bullshit. 




 Swedish. OK, maybe it's because of the blue-eyed blondes. 




 I agree with OP. I get killed much faster when playing in a server with 50ms ping than one with 140ms, it's ridiculous. It's almost impossible to lose a front-to-front when you have a high ping.  




 Ah, thanks. I haven't played much in that map yet. 




 What map is that? 




 Yeah, but which program did you use? 




 How did you extract the texture? 




 Talk about online video games all the time, specially League of Legends.

 Electronic Arts. Just because they sell unfinished games for full price, split them into several paid DLCs and include micro-transactions doesn't mean that they suck. 
Just kidding. they suck.

 It boggles me how people from Western cultures are so tolerant with an outdated culture that doesn't even respect human rights. Swedes really need to open their eyes, because once the 3rd world immigrants are there doing bad stuff, there won't be an easy way to revert the situation. 




 Yeah I got that problem a few times lately and only a reboot would fix it. So I installed the DirectX on the BF4 redist folder and so far so good. 









 RemindMe! Oct 18th Download PayDay on Steam! 




 It wasn't just based on the poorly optimized crap Watch Dogs is. I play BF4 a lot and there were some AMD-related memory leaks that were never fixed, and the game crashed if I tried enabling MSAA. Not to mention AC Unity and Far Cry 4 are coming out soon :) 




 Yeah I said medium because I kept in mind graphical evolutions like the Unreal Engine 4. Well, I'm glad to know that :) 




 I had an old HD5850 from when I built my PC in late 2009.  It was starting to suck on games like Watch Dogs and 1-2 months ago I decided to get a MSI GTX 760 Twin Frozr 2gb for 234 (cheapest I could find). 

Should I have waited for a price drop and got the 770?

Overly manly grandpa 




 My grandfather once told me something I consider to be incredibly useful and valuable to me.
It was a story, back from the old days when he worked. His workplace had a cafeteria, which sometimes had a full stock of food and beverages. Certain greedy workers noticed this and started taking them home and/or wasting them. And of course, after a while, there weren't enough food and beverages.
 "If we use our resources slowly, they'll always be enough.
 But if we get greedy and abuse them, they'll never be enough".

Fortunately he's still alive, but since he's 81, I fear it won't be for long :(
 




 I changed the birth date of some friends' Green Cards so they could go to a club (took a copy and photoshopped them). According to them, it worked. 




 Not being able to hold a conversation. Sucks when I ask a long question and she replies "yeah" or "lol".  




 Hardline is good enough, but not for full price. It's like a cops   criminals DLC to BF4. I'll probably buy it, but for a VERY discounted price on G2A (25-30). 




 Rich people sure know how to live. 




 But if you oppose to it, you're an evil nazi and the cancer of society. This isn't Sweden but I bet they have really similar situations. Where hard working people sponsor the life of those who don't contribute to society... 




 It would be considered racism if there were blondes touching black kids' skin and hair instead.

 Pale girls with blonde hair and blue eyes. 




 A woman pregnant with triplets was a victim in a robbery, and was shot 3 times in the belly. She went to the doctor and he said although the bullets reached the triplets, it wasn't in a critical zone, and eventually the bullets would come out their bodies. 2 healthy girls and a boy were born.

After 12 years, one of the girls was peeing, when she peed the bullet.

- "Mommy, some metal thing just came out of me" - she said.
So, mom explained to her what had happened when she was pregnant.
A week after that, the other girl was peeing, the same thing happened, and the mom explained it again.

After another week, the boy was in the bathroom and calls his mom.

- "Mom, you won't believe what just happened!" - he screamed.

- "It's OK son, you just peed some metal thing, wasn't it?" - she replied.

- "What? No! I was masturbating here in the bathroom when suddenly our dog died". 




 Did he have to disassemble, debug and patch the projector? :) 




 Model from Google Earth :p 




 That only happened with Sniper Elite 3, as far as I know. And I'm sure that with G2A shield you'd get this problem sorted out. 




 PhysX would be nice and it sounds plausible, considering previous GTAs were part of the TWIMTBP program. 




 They'll probably be enhancing DRM and downgrading the graphics. Bunch of crooks 




 I'm rather new to the Battlefield universe. I've only played BF3 (singleplayer) and BF4 (singleplayer + 400 hours of multiplayer) and I like the fact they offer modern warfare, but not futuristic (at least, not that much until Final Stand).
I just don't care for futuristic games with robots and super galactic weapons and stuff like that. I think Titanfall and COD are already enough when it comes to this matter, despite their differences to Battlefield. 

Then again, I might be wrong. I didn't play BF2142 after all. What's your opinion? 




 Ah I see. Thanks! 




 Oh, I see. thanks!

 Heeeh, a bit too short. I would have liked to answer more questions :) 




 ... I can't see it. 




 Lol don't even get me started on YIFY :p All of their 1080p releases have bitrates of ~2000 Kbps. Pretty much every 720p scene release I've ever downloaded is at least twice that.
Although I traditionally prefer scene PC-ISO/apps releases too, as protections get tougher some stuff is either gonna take a VERY long time to be released, or won't be released at all, thanks to their rules. Some fine examples of that are The Sims 4 and the new Dragon Age. This is where 3DM and their friends come in with their v6 crackfixes 'really workz now!', but well, it's better than nothing, I guess.
And well, I think SKIDROW has failed me more than P2P (Far.Cry.4-SKIDROW) :P 




 I love when 3DM or some other P2Pers release something, these fake blogs publish it and people are like "omzg skidrow juzt released crack for futball managor 2015 thx so much skidrow u r da best". 




 I really wasn't expecting to get so many replies, specially with so many explanations (I read all of them).
First, [here's the Google Form's summary of the responses.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1AU3sEVFAlJ9kpGZkkZjrxPlZx2tGoI_hxxgURzWl0Ac/viewanalytics#start=publishanalytics)

I noticed that it just had the names of the countries and not a graph. So I made [this interactive map.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CC6VcZIpSAF5Jq0ScFTX1j_dPiiGa1_RDUXjGa95mRc/pubchart?oid=528833391 format=interactive) 

Some interesting stuff (keep in mind that there's not as much data on non-Americans, non-whites and females):

* 64.4% of the USA participants think their country's dominant race will become a minority in it.

* 14.3% of the females would not have an interracial relationship, while only 6% of the males wouldn't.

* 78.4% of non-hispanic whites like being the race that they are, while this is only true for 63.3% of the participants of other races.

* "Propaganda" was the least popular factor of influence with an average of 0,83/4, while the most popular was "personal experiences in real life" with an average of 3,155/4. 

I also made a word cloud (using [this)](http://www.wordle.net/) with the words in all of the explanations you guys gave, [here it is.](http://i.imgur.com/QEIPSP8.png)

Finally, [here is a copy of the raw data in spreadsheet form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PqQb7pyPrXcdoHD8kbF_4R8xdB8kWIJarvHTeeVywck/edit?usp=sharing)

Thanks to everyone who was a part of this! :)
 




 I gotta start paying more attention to what I'm doing :/ 




 You guys mean the survey or the actual speech?
If it's the speech, I'll be one of the last of my class to do it, thanks to the alphabetical order, so it could take a few months. I could tell you guys how it went but I doubt by then you'd still be interested. But I'll be sure to publish the results of this survey when this leaves the front page or something! :) 




 I'm gonna give a speech for my Portuguese class which focuses on racial issues. This survey takes like 2 minutes if you're in a hurry, but more if you decide to explain your opinions. Thanks everyone :) 









 Damn this is awesome. 




 The door wasn't wide open. According to my parents, they left it closed (not locked). The trust we put in society was extreme, and yes, leaving the door open was a stupid mistake. But isn't invading someone else's house and taking away what's theirs much worse than honest people who would never do that forgetting to lock a door? Yes sir, we're the "cancer". Now I must go, though. Gotta support these people's welfare and their drop-out kids :) 




 My parents used to go to the supermarket thinking I would close the door when they left. And I usually did, but  one day I had my ear plugs on as I was studying, and didn't hear them leave. After a while, I seem to hear some small noise. I open the door and there are 2 filthy gypsy women in the kitchen. My heart starts racing and I pretend I believe their "oh we thought this home was for rent - or is it your neighbor's?" bullshit, as I'm physically weak and don't want trouble. One of them asked to go to the bathroom while the other one kept developing that fake story. When my parent's arrived, besides cleaning the toilet, they noticed some gold stuff we had (like necklaces we've been offered at our birth) had gone missing. 
Now I'm just hoping the government decides to cut welfare for these pieces of cancer. But I doubt it, in Europe we love supporting those who not only do nothing for us, but also damage our lives :) 




 I don't think that could have happened if you bought in the actual G2A website (not some phish crap) with PayPal, while using a PC with no malware. Not sure if G2A allows actually entering your credit card without a middleman like PayPal, but if it does and you did it, it was quite dumb. I bought BF4 Premium from G2A months ago and it worked, but I paid it with Paypal (Paypal credit from a bank transfer, not credit card, though). 




 This deserves gold. But... you know... not in this economy...

 I'd suggest lowering the the texture quality, but wow, you have a Titan. Does it stutter immediately after you start playing or only after a while? If it's only after a while, it might be a memory leak. 
Also, try changing the settings to "Maximum performance" in NVIDIA's control panel. And the texture thing, just to see if it makes any difference. 




 Nice one, will you publish the results once it ends? :) 




 I photoshopped a friend's ID card so that he could enter a night club. He said it worked. Oh, and I've cracked a few programs. 




 RELOADED has been releasing stuff under "DOGE" (like Goat.Simulator-DOGE). They just name that DLL for fun. You can clearly see it's part of the uPlay emu: http://i.imgur.com/XnhvAPl.png 




 Until 1 or 2 years ago I don't recall ever having problems with FPS stutters. Everything always worked fine. 

Now all of a sudden it seems that new games start to stutter, even though I upgraded to a GTX 760 (not top of the line, but hey, I get enough frames per second with it). Watch_Dogs, AC Unity, Far Cry 4... I know they're poorly optimized crap, but still, there are people with similar graphic cards who don't suffer from it. 

Does this happen to you?
 









 Dude complaining about i5 3570 and here I am with an i7 920 :/
 




 How did you make that glitch happen? 




 I think this happened when I had installed [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler). I fixed it by opening it and closing. But that's probably not what's happening with your PC. Try checking if you have your firewall on, and if your Internet connection is working properly. 




 Server name pls? 




 Create a retirement home for old porn stars. 




 Poor teammate :( 




  [OP] Objective Pushers Obliteration 

Ah, I'm adding that server to my favorites. I saw tr1plex, Yay_Dogecoins and ONYXGFX on then feed, so I thought it was SAS. 





























 Yay :D 




 No damn patch notes yet. 




 I guess they found another way to proper WaLMaRT :p 









 Huh what? 




 Yeah, that's pretty stupid and just kills the scene. By scene drama I meant the RELOADED-SKiDROW girl fights :p
Edit: maybe you meant [this](http://scenenotice.org/details.php?id=672)? 




 Scene drama 3 




 You're absolutely right. I mean, Razor and FLT are almost 30 years old, I don't think anyone would expect the old guys to still be active. Even "back in the day" there were members joining and leaving all the time, judging from old NFOs I found on [defacto2](http://www.defacto2.net/). Nonetheless, dispite its ups and downs the scene kept being about competition and quality, which is lacking these days, for the reason you said.
Great post! 









 OK. Maybe it's a bit pointless to create a whole new sub just for Warez Scene discussions, but it's a subject that some people like me find very interesting.

I've even made a [small wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/warezscene/wiki/index) with a "what's the scene" FAQ in there. Nice read, if you'd like to know what it is.

Anyway, sorry for promoting this sub here, I hope the mods don't take it the wrong way. If so, sorry :/

Keep in mind that while you can discuss cracks and whatnot, posting them isn't allowed. 




 You can easily find it pre-activated in several public trackers. 




 Maybe check your internet connection. I guess Windows needs a working one to retrieve the new passwords you set. 




 thx? 




 Using a technical preview OS as main OS. What could possibly go wrong? 




 You can download an ISO from most torrent trackers. Usually you can find an activator there too. Some actually claim to be pre-activated. What's the Windows you want?

 Exactly.
Or... well... actually...
**FIFA.13.INTERNAL-RELOADED**
Note: This release is meant for our sites, its ops and users, and those who
request it. 




 The fact scene veterans could but don't is the main reason I made the thread. 




 I heard about it, and tried it once, I think, but it looks sketchy. It's cool, yes, but just think about it. A "cracked steam" allows you to download games with several dozens of GB, increasing some server's load a lot,  **for free**? Maybe it's legit, but I wouldn't take the risk. If you want my advice, avoid it. 




 All the very popular games still get cracked but with no demand for the smaller ones, scene groups don't bother

Actually, I see many meaningless Steam being released by the scene, while titles with lots of demand (FIFA 15 and Dragon Age Inquisition, for example) aren't released, not even [internally](https://scenelingo.wordpress.com/2008/07/16/what-does-internal-mean/). 
I think the increasing toughness of DRM is the reason. 
 




 There have been reports of that, but I think such cases are rare.

**Prototype.2.Proper-SKIDROW**
 So now we have decided to proper Fairlight's Prototype 2 release,
because our crack is fully reversed and CEG free. Which gives the end
user a more stable crack, with less crashes, startup problems gone,
fast loading, better framerates etc. are some of the problems that our
fully reversed crack prevents.

Worth mentioning that in some cases, properly removing DRM might actually improve the performance.

**Prototype 2 STATEMENT READNFO-FLT**

Here we
have Securom as protection, what is known to slow down a game's performance
in general, with more protection features activated, the more of a
performance hit you might see in theory. 

As someone said it, if the game is not updated (it's done manually, so there are many pirates who probably don't bother doing it), you might be playing an unoptimized version of the game. Fortunately, both the Scene and the P2P usually release updates.
 




 Not sure I get your point. Steam, Origin, uPlay, whatever, which you use to preload the game (and are necessary to play it) are DRM. That's the topic here. 




 Whether the P2Pers can fulfill my wish to play pirated games, it's sad (in a way) to see the current state of the Scene, compared to what it used to be. 




 Done 




 Demo division is still active (a couple of their members will be in Revision 2015 Easterparty). Not much is known about their warez division, though, but it might have something to do with their member dycus dying. **Rayman_Origins__RiP_DYCUS-Razor1911**:

He was the one behind many Trainers
    and without him even our few releases wouldn't have seen the light of day as
    he was the best game tester you could think of. 

This is also very interesting:
**Response.To.Our.Recent.Nukes
.SCENENOTiCE-WaLMaRT**
This is where we introduce **Cracker B**. The guy was
very well spoken and appeared to be very skilled.
He was able to patch CEG games for us in a fast and
efficient manor. He claimed to be an ex member of
Two other groups, which he backed up by sharing their
tools with us.
- SteamStub Unpacker Enigine 0.4 Win 8 Version
- Origin Unpacking Dumping Engine 0.2
These tools included an icon with a **Razor logo**,
so we can only assume they came from there. None
of these tools were used in any of our release, we
were making our own. Cracker B was purely showing
off the fact that he was in possession of these tools.
After some time we received another nuke, this time
concerning suspicions that the release was stolen from
a P2P source.
Tensions were high in the group after the nuke and the
member was soon banned. **He has since moved on to another
group with Cracker B**

Now, I have no idea if it's common for groups to share tools, but I guess it's not, since it takes a lot of effort to develop them. So is this "**Cracker B**" a former Razor1911 member? If so, I wonder what's that group he moved to...
 









 Steam games are the most popular, but they seem like the worst titles to crack if they want their e-penis to grow. I mean, everyone cracks Steam. Well, by everyone I don't mean just about anyone who can open a disassembler, but you can actually find some documentation about reversing Steam in the open web, and many, many P2Pers do it just fine. I actually recall SKIDROW mocking FLT for only cracking "lame Sims expansions" which only had some disc-check protection. Remember when Razor1911 released The_Settlers_7-Razor1911? They said they didn't care about cracking Assassin's Creed 2 for technical details, that The Settlers had the true real Ubisoft DRM, and thus they just waited. Now, if more games == bigger dick, they would have just released ACII... right? I think the tougher the protection the more bragging rights. But then why doesn't FLT start cracking harder stuff? I'm confused... :/ 




 Scene releases usually follow [some rules](http://www.sbytes.info/NFOwb.php?id=Rules.For.The.Game.Scene.Charts) that can actually mean better cracks. Most times you might not even feel the difference, though, since it's mostly technical stuff. Also, sceners can proper each other until there's a working release, and their reputation is important to them, so we're less likely to see poor quality stuff (SKIDROW doesn't apply to this, of course :P ) 




 Not necessarily, but that seems to be happening. 




 I don't wish we had less Steam releases. In fact, it's quite the opposite, since there's much more scene competition with Steam. My point is that protections are getting tougher to crack, specially if you follow the old scene rules, and it's easy to see that groups are avoiding such DRMs and sticking with simpler ones like Steam, which one day may be in danger as well, since DRMs tend to get tighter over time, not worse.  




 I don't think most downloaders realize what's happening in the PC-ISO scene. I haven't payed attention to it for as long as some you might have (let's say, since the early 2000s), but the future seems dark. I feel that there until 3-4 years ago there was a lot more competition. I mean, what's happening these days? FLT cracks nothing but a few Steam releases, RELOADED cracks UbiDRM, most Steam Releases and some Origin releases. Oh yeah, let's talk about the Origin stuff. Not looking good.

 FIFA.13.INTERNAL-RELOADED 

 Crysis.3.INTERNAL-RELOADED

 Crysis.3.Crackfix.INTERNAL-RELOADED

 Crysis.3.Crackfix.2.INTERNAL-RELOADED

 Crysis.3.Update.v1.2.INTERNAL-RELOADED

Not to mention The.Sims.4-RELOADED that was released like a month after the P2P release, and FIFA 15 that wasn't released by any scene group at all.

SKIDROW used to be annoying with their rushed P2Pish cracks, but at least they tried hard. Now they pretty much only release Steam stuff and get into little girl fights with RELOADED (check out Assassins.Creed.Unity.v1.5.Update.STATEMENT-SKIDROW).

CODEX looks promising, but I guess we'll have to wait and see.

And where's the old Razor1911 in all of this? Cracking Linux and OSX stuff from time to time...

Sid_Meiers_Civilization_V_Complete_Edition_Linux-Razor1911 

Wasteland_2_MacOSX-Razor1911

Wasteland_2_Linux-Razor1911

 XCOM_Enemy_Unknown_The_Complete_Edition_Linux-Razor1911

What do you guys think? 




 It was a freaking lame-ass server emulator with random values. 




 "3 extra lines of assembler" - LOL. Shut up instead of saying that kind of shit. You probably think today's DRMs are crackmes from youtube tutorials. Those "cracker kids" are people who spend years learning Assembly and improving their Reverse Engineering skills. 




 Are you in Europe or the US? 




 Hello,
I'll be visiting London for the first time next month. Is it okay to address men as "sir" and women as "ma'am" in the UK? While I don't think "sir" would be much of a problem, I think I read somewhere that some women don't like being addressed as "ma'am" as it's usually used with old ladies.

Thanks in advance :)
