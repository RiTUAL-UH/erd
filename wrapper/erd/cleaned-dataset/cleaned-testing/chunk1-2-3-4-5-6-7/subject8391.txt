 I disagree on it's easy. When I walk out a bar in Japan, I have a choice of taking a train, bus or cab home and they will all be there waiting for me within minutes. That doesn't happen in the US and when you've been drinking, preparing for alternative transportation usually is not on the top of your thoughts.

That being said, it's no excuse to drink and drive. I simple made the statement because even with tougher laws, I don't think the US would see the same dramatic drop in people not breaking the law due to it not being easy to find other transportation. But even a small drop would be fine by me. 




 The key difference is that Japan has quality and safe public transportation so that it's easy to go out drinking without driving or designating someone as a driver.  









 Not to have any resolutions - I learned long ago that if something was worth making a resolution about, it was worth beginning immediately instead of waiting for the New Year to begin.  



















 It is this reason that I still don't understand why Kucinich is polling so low. The man tells the truth and has made the right call on all the big issues from a Democratic standpoint. I hope that we as voters are also brave enough o vote for a person that stands up for the truth and not someone who is supposedly "electable" 









 ??? Why is the goal $200,000 when the blimp costs $350,000 - am I missing something?

update: I see they changed it to $350,000 




 How about putting together a very simple webpage for an opposing candidate so not only does he lose money, it also earns the opposing candidate money ;) 









 Someone that seems to be talking from the heart for once instead of taking polls to see what they are supposed to say. If there is a better democratic candidate running, someone please show me what I'm missing. I don't understand why this guy isn't leadng in the polls. 




 Seriously, what happened to us as a country? Quite depressing to see what we have let our leaders do and it is abominable that there are not more in congress fighting to uphold the true American values.  




 It just depresses me to no end that of all the Democrats, there is only one that is willing to stand up to Bush and Cheney and try to hold them accountable for what they have done. If what the Bush adminstration has done sickens you, support this guy and help him keep up the fight to get rid of those that don't deserve to be where they are

 The more I listen to him, the more I hope he gets the nomination. Granted, I don't agree with some of what he is promoting, but then nobody is going to agree with me 100% of the time. What is nice is he seems to have principles which I just don't see in the others running for office. It would be nice if he could garner the Internet support that Ron Paul has and although I have been silent on this thus far, I will do my part to help from this point forward (and hope that others here on Reddit who believe he is the best candidate of the bunch will do the same)

 Actually, Japan uses paper money far more than in the US. When I wasliving in Japan (10 years ago) I was paid in cash each month to the tune of $3000. Almost all homes have a fairly large stash of cash which would have been washed away. Things have changed quite a bit, but the older generation still uses cash almost exclusively.

 I don't know enough about James Wilson or whether this is accurate to respond to this. Part of the problem is she jumps about and talks about a lot more than just the pledge of allegiance. Need some help on the best way to respond to this argument. This was her response after I explained that God was added to the pledge of allegiance in 1954 and explaining the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

"What is been taken away is the freedom to acknowledge God in schools and government arenas ...that was never the intent of the Founding Fathers.....Just because the did not the phrase "under God" until later it does not reflect the original intention. Founding Father, James Wilson, Supreme Court Judge He was appointed by George Washington to the Supreme Court. He served for nine years. 

Signed the Dec. of Ind. And the Constitution His legal lectures (three books) were used in the first organized legal training for law students. You can still get copies of those books. Here is what he said. Law made for men and nations flows from the same divine source the law of God, what we do must be founded on what he has done. The deficiency of our laws must be supplied by the perfections of his. 

Human law must rest its authority ultimately upon the authority of that law which is Divine. 

In factthe early court made numerous decision defending the Ten Commandments. You were just as likely to find the Ten Commandments hanging in a government building and school, as you were a church. 

Marshall said the Ten Commandments must be fundamental precepts of our civil society 

Quotes from George Washington: 

You do well to wish to learn our arts and ways of life, and above all, the religion of Jesus Christ. These will make you a greater and happier people than you are. 

While we are zealously performing the duties of good citizens and soldiers, we certainly ought not to be inattentive to the higher duties of religion. To the distinguished character of Patriot, it should be our highest glory to add the more distinguished character of Christian. The blessing and protection of Heaven are at all times necessary but especially so in times of public distress and danger. The General hopes and trusts that every officer and man will endeavor to live and act as becomes a Christian soldier, defending the dearest rights and liberties of his country. 

I now make it my earnest prayer that God would most graciously be pleased to dispose us all to do justice, to love mercy, and to demean ourselves with that charity, humility, and pacific temper of the mind which were the characteristics of the Divine Author of our blessed religion."

 It helped me make a decision. I usually fly to LA from SF bay area and rent a car, but I decided to rent a car and spend a day driving down there next month. The cost is about the same (an extra two days of rental car + gas = plane ticket), but it does mean a lot more time - something I am willing to accept to avoid the screening machines. 

Unfortunately, this isn't going to be possible for many of the longer flights that I must take, but I'm hoping if enough people start opting out of shorter flights, the airlines will also start to place pressure on this issue. 









 I have always thought I believed that all human beings are equal. I recently started thinking that I could save someone's life if I were to donate one of my kidneys to someone in need of one. Why is it that I hesitate in doing this because I don't know the person it will go to when I wouldn't hesitate to do the same for someone I know. Does this mean that I really don't believe that all human life is equal?

 I often find that the cheapest ticket still ends up being on the airline's site. After using an aggregate search, always go directly to the airline site that was the least expensive.

 Video Explanation:

Ivn Fernndez Anaya: True Sportsmanship Display @ Cross Country Race, Burlada 
Is winning all that counts? Are you absolutely sure about that?

Very little has been said about this.....On 22 December 2012, Basque athlete Ivn Fernndez Anaya was competing in a cross-country race in Burlada, Navarre. He was running second, some distance behind race leader Abel Mutai - bronze medalist in the 3,000-meter steeplechase at the London Olympics. As they entered the finishing straight, he saw the Kenyan runner - the certain winner of the race - mistakenly pull up about 10 meters before the finish, thinking he had already crossed the line.

Fernndez Anaya quickly caught up with him, but instead of exploiting Mutai's mistake to speed past and claim an unlikely victory, he stayed behind and, using gestures, guided the Kenyan to the line and let him cross first.

Ivan Fernandez Anaya, a Basque runner of 24 years who is considered an athlete with a big future (champion of Spain of 5,000 meters in promise category two years ago) said after the test:
"But even if they had told me that winning would have earned me a place in the Spanish team for the European championships, I wouldn't have done it either. I also think that I have earned more of a name having done what I did than if I had won. And that is very important, because today, with the way things are in all circles, in soccer, in society, in politics, where it seems anything goes, a gesture of honesty goes down well."

He said at the beginning: unfortunately, very little has been said of the gesture. And it's a shame. In my opinion, it would be nice to explain to children, so they do not think that sport is only what they see on TV: violent kicks in abundance, posh statements, fingers in the eyes of the enemy ...

 Personal finances is usually the discussion of money, how to earn it and where it goes. Is that really what should be the focus when helping people with personal finances?

 Saturday September 29 is [National Public Lands Day](http://www.publiclandsday.org/) and as part of that, all [National Parks are offering free entrance](http://technorati.com/lifestyle/travel/article/free-entrance-to-national-parks-on/). Here is a [list of National Parks which usually charge a fee](http://www.nationalparksblog.com/national-park-fees-list/), but will be waived on the 29th. 



















 Yes, it is a bit confusing. Any entity that falls under the national park system (park, monument, preserve, seashore, etc) are all consider "parks" (there are 397 of them). The link you gave shows all those that charge an entrance fee (most don't at any time) -- and that fee is waived on the free days.

 Most people know that quarters and dimes before 1965 are made of silver and those made in 1965 and after have no silver content. Many people assume it's true for half dollars as well, but it's not. While half dollars made from 1965 - 1970 have less silver (40%) than those made 1964 and earlier (90%), their silver content still makes them worth much more than 50 cents. Check with your bank if anyone has recently cashed in half dollars in rolls, and if they have, buy them. There will often be half dollars from 1965 - 1970 in them.

 Since it's a non profit support organization for the national parks system, I'm sure they would love to do it for everyone, but simply don't have the funds to do it for more than one grade level. I don't know why they chose 4th grade for sure, but it's an age when they kids are young enough to still love exploring, but old enough to also appreciate the wonder around them...it seems like a good age to target for their goals. 




 All the national park [annual passes](http://www.nps.gov/findapark/passes.htm) are remaining the same price -- this is by far the best deal for visiting national parks and by getting one, it encourages you to visit them more.

 This beach is actually quickly disappearing.

 Thanking people for the work they do. 

I started doing this about 2 years ago because of a friend. I noticed everywhere she went, she would thank people for the work they do. We'd walk into a fast food restaurant and some person would be mopping the floor, she would stop and thank the person for keeping the place clean and safe. Walking down the street and some guy holding up a caution sign, she would thank him for helping to keep people safe. When we would be out hiking, instead of just saying "hi" to the rangers we passed, she'd say "thank you for the job you do. It's greatly appreciated"

The vast majority of people work very hard at what they do and never get recognized for it. You'll be amazed at the surprise and the joy people have when you recognize their hard work. It's simple, doesn't cost anything and it will likely make someone's day.

 None of the warehouses are better than shopping sales. What you do get is a consistently decent price if you usually pay retail at other stores.
