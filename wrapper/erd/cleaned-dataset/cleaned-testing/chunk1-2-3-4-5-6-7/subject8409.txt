 It seems legit http://i.imgur.com/i9oKXza.jpg 









 What did you say before that

Exactly. Yet Abraham calls them Lord.

I was responding to your mindset that every time the Bible says Lord it means God.

On that I said it is untrue, adonai is used as Lord/Master of all or as Lord/Master.

But in this context it it is correct to say that in verse 3 it means God/Lord of all.

 




 The headline is from Reuters. At the time the details were not known.  




 This guy is usually correct, except when it's about Israel...

https://conflictantiquities.wordpress.com/ 




 Neither have I. 

The whole thing doesn't make sense. As far as I know Shiites don't destroy Mosques.  

IT 'source' [Al-Araby](http://www.alaraby.co.uk/society/a911a6c0-0d6a-4450-afe7-138feb8c1838) writes clearly that the militias only seized the synagogue. The Shrine of Ezra still remains under Shi'a control.

I have no idea what went wrong..

I now compared [Al-Araby's photo](http://www.alaraby.co.uk/fullimage/3f9b540d-4039-45e8-a648-9a4779a0938d/a911a6c0-0d6a-4450-afe7-138feb8c1838) to multiple photo's of the Shrine of Ezra.

There's absolutely no resemblance. 

Side note; Josephus writes that Ezra Hasofer was buried in Jerusalem.

 You got it all wrong.
One angels assignment was to tell Abraham that Sarah would him bear a child. Once his task is over, the Bible doesn't feel a need to continue speaking about him.


God appeared. 

18:1

Now the Lord appeared to him in the plains of Mamre

The three angels.

18:2

 And he lifted his eyes and saw, and behold, three men were standing beside him,

This doesn't mean actually standing "right" beside him for then there would be no need to run towards them

and he saw and he ran toward them from the entrance of the tent,". 

Abraham asked God not to leave him while he attended to the three angels.

18:3 
My lords (The word  (My lords) is plural, but the plural is interpreted as respectful, not meaning more then one), if only I have found favor in your eyes, please do not pass on from beside your servant.

One angels assignment was to tell Abraham that Sarah would him bear a child. 

18:10
And **"he"** said  

(note it's in singular form, it was one angel speaking)

I will surely return to you at this time next year, and behold, your wife Sarah will have a son.

The angels task was over, the Bible doesn't feel a need to continue speaking about him. 

The other two angels who continued on to Sodom still had a task to fulfill. 

18:22
And the men turned from there and went to Sodom

18:32 

And the Lord departed..

(Source: Midrash) 




 




 Like I said before. 

The context of Abraham asking God not to leave him while he attends the three arriving angels clearly implies that God was NOT one of them. 




 verse 1

           

Now the Lord appeared to him in the plains of Mamre, and he was sitting at the entrance of the tent when the day was hot.

verse 3

      ****     

And he said, "My lords (The word  (My lords) is plural, but the plural is interpreted as respectful, not meaning more then one), if only I have found favor in your eyes, please do not pass on from beside your servant.

**** is in singular form because Abraham was addressing God, not the angels. 

Abraham asked God not to leave him while he attended to the three angels. 

where did yahweh come from?

He was there the whole time. 



 



















 Nope. Jacob was face to face with an angel who had God-like attributes, not God.
You admitted to this by Moses and Aaron.
/infinite loop 









 {deletion needed} 




 And so was the angel to Jacob....

 









 The meaning for the word is always God.

Was Moses and Aaron Gods??? 














 Never.  Jacob was striven with an angel, not God himself.



Besides for in reference to God, the word "Elohim" is used all over the Bible for false gods, angels and humans (Kings etc.).

Quick example, Exodus 7:1

The Lord said to Moses, "See! I have made you a **"Elohim"**( Lord) over Pharaoh, and Aaron, your brother, will be your speaker.

The Bible means that Moses was "divine' over Pharaoh because Moses was God's representative to Egypt.

This is how Genesis 32:29 should be read
 And he said, "Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, **because you have striven with an angel of God** ("Elohim") and with men, and you have prevailed."

Edit: Just remembered Psalms 8:6 with "Elohim" in reference to angels

Yet Thou hast made him but little lower than the **"Elohim"** (angels), and hast crowned him with glory and honor.

 Very sad! May his memory be blessed.

 




 You are correct. Jabob wresling with the angel of Esau. 

Some Christians try to twist the meaning of scripture and claim it was Jesus.
They have this weird obsession with the Hebrew word "Ish" (Man).  Every time it is mentioned in the Bible they try to push Jesus in to it.

I'm in no way a Bible scholar and quite certain that I'm much younger then him.
But for anyone who reads the Bible in Hebrew all these claims sound completely ridiculous.

For any real questions, the proper person to ask is a Rabbi. 




 True, but my statement is still valid. "Adonai" is pleural  and "Adoni" is singular. 

According to you God, Jesus and the Holy Ghost all appeared in human form as "MAN" to Abraham. This is absurd. I doubt even Christians agree with you.

You also never answered my original question. If you interpret "Ish" to mean Jesus, how was Jacob able to overpower a God?

 
26 **When he saw that he could not prevail against him**, he touched the socket of his hip, and the socket of Jacob's hip became dislocated as he wrestled with him.	
 




 Exactly. Yet Abraham calls them Lord.

Sir, you are mistaken. The Hebrew word "Adonai" is used tens of times in Bible in a non divine way. 

The meaning is Lord as in Master *Edit 2/17 for Clarification:[ and also as Lord of all or God]. 

I'm mobile right now, but if you'd like, later tonight I can bring examples to prove you wrong. 

Your mistake may originate from the fact that you are reading a translation of the Bible instead of the Bible in its original form. 

*Edit 2/17 for clarification In this case it does mean Lord/Master of all or God but he's mistaken to assume that Adonai is always is in reference to God.

But as far as I l know according to the Judaism  the text is not referring to the three men only God

See http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/2vy0r5/serious_i_need_clear_explanation_for_this/conet74
for a proper explanation 

This mistake comes from translating Hebrew to English and defining one word as it's meaning without looking at each case for its context  




  [Genesis 18] 

They were three MEN

[Genesis 32:22-31]

Are you claiming that Jacob overpowered a God?  




 The Christian concept of "trinity" came much later (I think John) and flies in the face of the Bible's account of God being one. 

Being three and somehow also one doesn't make sense. 

If "God" is composed of the unity of three, then each part of that "God" is lacking and not absolute. This is not "One" "God". 

Grouping the three dependent parts together and calling that trinity a one "God" doesn't diminish this.

Also no were does the Bible suggest that the Messiah will be in any way devine. 

G-d born to a virgin mother is an ancient pagan concept which was later adapted by the Christians.

 I'll keep it mind. 




 Suggest you click on 'take a tour' for a tour of our solar system. 




 Mass chaos 




 As of now its not legal for a search and rescue org. to use a drone to search for a missing person from the air.  The FAA considers them like for profit which aren't allowed to operate without a whole bunch of licences. 

While a hobbyist can do as he pleases.

The FAA is clarifying the rules this year. Hopefully this will change.    




 The headline is the text from the website and what they claim to prove. [I](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2vi2wt/http_vs_https_speed_test/cohw968) and others clarified it in the comments section.
 




 No, thats not it. Thanks anyway for the effort! 

I'm also too young to have watched that... 




 Indeed it is. This site reminds of an IMAX film I once watched. Can't remember the name. Wish I could watch it again.

I stumbled on this website a few days ago.  




 That looks like a case of an inaccurate HTTPS speedtest result being sort of accurate... ;) 




 These types of fruad are also repetitive.. 




 I got flamed for criticizing Obama on his Vox Interview.

 In the end, after a very long covo. I managed to get a half-hearted apology from one of the Jew haters. 
 




 SPDY can disabled in Firefox by going to about:config and find network.http.spdy.enabled  and double-click on it to make it TRUE

Is this the case? 




 Its HTTPS with SPDY. Technically HTTPS is slower then HTTP, it's the SPDY that makes it faster. 




 Yeah, but currently the FAA deems all non-profit's as commercial and it would be illegal for an emergency responder to fly outdoors. He'd have to endanger himself to physically put the drone in the collapsed structure to be allowed to fly it.

 Insane. 




 Be careful, I was flamed by two users for posting that video

 




 This is why many Journalists ask to not have their passport stamped.   




 Thank you for the advice. I will surely keep it in mind. I apologize for calling him a troll.

In this case, I sent my post before reading his comment in entirety. It was sent after reading the first line, his fake quote. I thought he was just messing around.   




 Pravda means "Truth" in Russian. There's an old joke on Pravda Newspaper's so-called "Truth's" 

"There is no Pravda in Izvestia, and there is no Izvestia in Pravda" 

English "There is no truth in News, and there is no news in Truth."  




 It's a dying dialect. 

One of the times I was at The Center for Jewish History, the librarian practically begged me to switch our conservation language to Yiddish. It seems she doesn't have too many people to practice her language skills with.

With Duolingo-Yiddish on the way, maybe there is still hope.
  




 litvish/akademish, you mean the yiddishist dialect? 

 




 You caught me :) 




 I never suggested that, I agree with you.

I have no idea why my religious affiliation was brought up in this sub.

My political opinion and has nothing to do with my religious views. If the victims would have been Christian, Muslim (one of them actually was), Hindu, Sikh, Atheist etc. I'd feel the same way.

My only issue is OBAMA calling it a RANDOM event and THE CONTEXT.

France declared it a targeted attack against Jews, Obama is calling it just a RANDOM act of violence.

He is ignoring the CONTEXT of the event, the Jewish victims and the supermarket, because the CONTEXT actually shows that it wasn't RANDOM. He is being politically biased to his views on policy. I wont get in to the details, it's a side topic...  


So what? Jews aren't special, they're no better than anyone else.

Jews are not special and are no different than anyone else.

Jews don't claim to be "special".

What do you think "chosen" means?

If you think "privileged" you're making a big mistake, because being "chosen" doesn't make things easy. Actually the opposite is true. Were the Jews killed in Auschwitz "special" or "privileged"?

You get chosen for something specific, not just generally "chosen".

According to Judaism, G-d chose Jews for more duties, not privileges and is harsher to them when it comes to judgment. Jews have to obey 613 Laws while non Jews only 7.

It's directed at the Media. Understand?

Yes, it may have been written in poor taste and I will delete it, but it's in no way how you think it is, islamaphobic etc

Lol, seriously? Look at the subs your a moderator of. look at your comment history. Your obviously a zionist 

bang head on wall

Thank G-d I have a high tolerance level and can keep my cool but it's nearing the breaking point.

Do you even have a clue what the subs stand for?

I am interested in genealogy (the study of ones ancestry).
Here's reddit's Genealogy sub  http://www.reddit.com/r/Genealogy/

I created a board for people who share common Jewish ancestors to connect and help each other with their family trees.
As of now it's inactive.

All the subs stand for 'Jewish Genealogy'. 

/r/jewgen
/r/Jewish_Genealogy
/r/jewishgen
/r/JewishGenealogy

They aren't  "Zionist" code word's...
Please explain what is racist or Islamaphobic about that. If anything you're the who is being racist and Judeophobic. 

Am I not allowed to be interested in my Jewish heritage and ancestry? 
 
Have a good one. I'm taking a brake from this non-sense. /bang head on wall
 




 The source is irrelevant? Wow. You forgot how to be a credible person.

The source only uploaded an unedited video of Obama. Anyone can listen to it without bias and decide for themselves. 

Understand?

Edit 2/10
Is it important that it's disclosed what type of Muslim the victims are and what type of establishment they're in every time another situation happens?

Like I said before, my main issue is Obama calling it a RANDOM event. 




 Thank you for you concern.

My comments on this thread is my own political opinion and  has nothing to do with my belief. If the victims were Christian, Muslim (one of them actually was), Hindu, Sikh, atheist etc. i'd feel the same way.

My humble opinion is that Obama is ignoring the victims and portraying this hideous attack as something trivial. Be the victims of any race or religion.  He is ignoring the CONTEXT of the event, the Jewish victims and the supermarket, because CONTEXT actually shows that it wasn't a RANDOM act of violence

When I said that it appears that Obama is biased, I mean, that Obama has a political bias. Obama has a reason why he refrains from such discussions. I wont get it to it now, it's a side topic...

The only one who brought religion in to the discussion (if you can call it a discussion) was [andsothenbut](http://www.reddit.com/user/andsothenbut) and [secondaryaccount22](http://www.reddit.com/user/secondaryaccount22).

 [andsothenbut](http://www.reddit.com/user/andsothenbut) "knows" I am a Zionist (even though I'm not) and [secondaryaccount22](http://www.reddit.com/user/secondaryaccount22)" knows" what's better for Jews  (I have no idea why my religion was dragged in to this political discussion) and expects I listen to his orders (typical liberal view of claiming to know better then the person and then advise them to do as they think).

You are both bigoted and anti-semitic. 




 Thanks for the heads up. The OP deleted his post and you are now only quoting my comment WITHOUT CONTEXT. 

The OP posted that 
violence against civilians doesn't equate to terrorism

my response was;

"Yes. "Hitler wasn't a terrorist" because he "didn't kill" for the purpose of scare tactics, rather for ethnic cleansing and world domination. According to you "Hitler was the good guy"?
 
My only issue is OBAMA calling it a RANDOM event and THE CONTEXT.
He is ignoring the CONTEXT of the event, the Jewish victims and the supermarket, because the CONTEXT actually shows that it wasn't a RANDOM act of violence. He is being politically biased to his views on policy. I wont get in to the details, it's a side topic...

Edit: I noticed you edited your post to try to make it look better in your favor  




 That's a lie.

Anyone can do that. Example:

 I just quoted [/u/probablyreasonable](http://www.reddit.com/user/probablyreasonable) being unreasonable
 




 The source is irrelevant.  Please stick to your argument. 

Why is my title ridiculous? The accuser must bring fourth the evidence. 
 
I agree with you that there's nothing wrong in calling Jews a "bunch of folks" or a Kosher supermarket a "deli". 

The ONLY issue IS WITH THE CONTEXT, as you so rightfully say. 

France declared it a targeted attack against Jews, Obama is calling it just a RANDOM act of violence. Couple that with the fact he doesn't mention any of the CONTEXT of the event, the kosher supermarket and the victims being Jews(which shows that it wasn't a random act of violence). It appears to me he's being *Edit for clarification 2/10 [politically] biased. 

So yes, actually it's all about CONTEXT.

Interesting observation.  Your mouth is spewing vile hate, "extremist diartbags", "Zionist".. (which to your misfortune isn't true, I'm not a Zionist) and you have the audacity to call me an extremist? 

Even though you don't care about all that I wrote an till now, i'll still do you a favor and tell you that you're ruining the image of whatever political party you belong to.

I suggest you take some deep breaths or maybe even a walk and then if you speak as a decent human being should i'll listen to your opinion. 

*Edit 2/10 for clarification: The source only uploaded an unedited video of Obama to youtube. 
 Anyone can listen to it without any bias and decide for themselves. 




 I agree  that there's nothing wrong in calling Jews a "bunch of folks?" or a Kosher supermarket a "deli". 

The ONLY issue is WITH THE CONTEXT, as you so rightfully say. 


France declared it was a targeted attack against Jews, Obama is calling it just a RANDOM act of violence which didn't target anyone specifically. Couple that with fact that President Obama did not mention any CONTEXT of said event and who was the target, makes me see him being politically biased. 

 OP, you're not going to garner support for your causes

You are wrong here again, Sir. I came on reddit to have a civil political discussion/debate. What makes you think I am trying to garner support. Am I a lobbyist?
 
 




 He had in the past.. 




 Friedlander actually did write commentaries under his own

Yes I know. That's what I wrote here.
 could have just stuck to publishing commentary under his own name

You aren't to blame, my writing skills aren't the greatest.

Also, Friedlander appears to have been a bit of a maskil 

He also left his wife a agunah and took a second wife([1](http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=50517 hilite=f96a31c0-a616-49b8-b37c-addcfc58d7f0 st=%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%93%D7%9C%D7%A0%D7%93%D7%A8 pgnum=193)[2](http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=50517 hilite=f96a31c0-a616-49b8-b37c-addcfc58d7f0 st=%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%93%D7%9C%D7%A0%D7%93%D7%A8 pgnum=197)) .

 and if he had published the commentary under his own name it would probably have been reasonably popular

Friedlander who forged the Yerushalmi was also a very knowledgeable person and could have just stuck to publishing his own commentary under his own name, if he would have put his mind to it. This is just something that I won't be able to understand.

And, at least in the edition I own, he includes a translation of Conan Doyle's story (presented as nonfiction) as an appendix to his own story, which is essentially a parallel narrative about the same events involving the Maharal acting behind the scenes. (Its been a long time since I actually read it so I don't remember all the details.)

Just looked it up. You are correct. 




 They enter Gitmo with a Master's degree in "Death to the crusader America and the Zionist Jew's" and graduate with a doctorate...

You can run your own Private IRC chat server on a $20 WRT54G router.  Use point to point antennas for 10 mile+ TX/RX on WiFi Band's. No FCC power limits.

 Hummus's main ingredient is the mashed chickpeas. 




 The line's that you see are called contour lines.
Each contour line represents a specific value (number) of depth below the surface of the water.

The maximum depth till the bottom surface under the water (more deep) would be the high number and minimum depth of surface till the bottom surface under the water (more shallow) would be the low number.

So let's look at question 1a: What is the maximum depth (more deep/high - number) you would reach if you traversed along the path shown below?
Follow the red line, at about 19.5 lat and 66.5 long the depth is -8,000 which is the deepest point on the line.
  




 I second it. 




 It has very much to do with what people answered on the question "What does it mean to be Jewish". 




 Interesting results.

I noticed Pesach/Passover is more important to [r/Judaism](http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/) then Yom Kipper/Day of Atonement and Rosh HaShana/New Years. 

Edit: Another interesting detail, remembering the Holocaust is a lot more important to [r/Judaism](http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/) then Judaism being a part of your identity.

Also Maimonides scored the most in "Who is your favorite Rabbi/Theologian.
 




 Thanks for the link. I'm also going to check if hebrewbooks.org has any of his Seforim. 

Just remembered another wild claim. He wrote that President Woodrow Wilson was a descendant of a character in his book. 
 




 Most of the story's on the MaHaRaL's Golem comes from the book Nifl'os MaHaRaL miPrague by Rabbi Yudel Rosenberg. 

R' Rosenberg also put out a book called Choshen Mishpat. I once read it and noticed it is almost an exact copy of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's book The Jew's Breastplate.

He basically plagiarized the whole plot, story-line, just switched the main character to the *Edit: [MaHaRaL] and added his own ending. He then presented the fictional tale as fact.   

In the preface of both books Nifl'os Maharal miPrague and Choshen Mishpat Rosenberg claims it was based upon manuscript's he acquired.

Since I have proof he lied regarding the book Choshen Mishpat there's no reason for me to believe Nifl'os MaHaRaL miPrague  is anything more then fiction.
 
I believe the author has zero credibility and most if not all of his story's on the MaHaRaL's Golem is false.

 The hate on social media is out of control. Search twitter for "Lakewood" and "Jew" for endless vile and anti-Semitic tweets.

Lately there has been significant raise in hate and anti-semitism from Jackson. 

The cause may have to do with recent events. A Hasidic sect built new house's bordering Jackson. For reason's I don't understand, some people don't like it.

Although this girl is clearly deranged, she is not the only family member that shares her views...
             
From social media post's it appears she may be using drugs, which explains a lot.   

Edit: I stand corrected. As far as I now know the new houses were not built near Jackson.

 It appears you are grossly ill informed on the Shi'ite Houthis relations with the Jews.

The Houthi's have a vast history of anti-Semitic violence against Jew.

The Jew's of Yemen are anti-Zionist due to the secular nature of the State of Israel. This hasn't helped them one iota.

In January 2007, Houthi leaders threatened the Jewish families in Saada and Raida, "We warn you to leave the area immediately... We give you a period of 10 days, or you will regret it."

The entire community fled to the capital where the President of Yemen gave the Jews protection in the Jewish quarter in Alafi Qaa, Sanna.

In 2008 Moshe Nahari, a well-known figure in Raida's Jewish community was shot dead.

Not too long ago a Yemenite Jew was stabbed to death. I also remember another incident where a hand grenade was thrown at a Jew which killed him. I don't know if it was by Houthi's or AQAP.

Last month two Jewish boy's in Sanna were beaten by Houthi's and forced to convert to Islam by praying the Shahadah (There is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God) to their prophet Mohammed.

The Jews of Yemen are constantly being being assaulted and harassed.

The Houthi's destroyed their homes, sanctuaries, cars, took their money and property.

They took over Yemen's Jewish library which also holds many antique Jewish manuscripts and a very ancient and rare Torah scroll.

In the 1930's there were over 40 synagogues in Sanna alone, today there's only one left. Many Jewish cemetery's were also destroyed.

This the end of the 2,500 year's of Jews in Yemen.


So no, "Death to Israel" is not a reaction to government policy, it's plain old Jew hatred. 




  but unlike the Sunni extremists they don't go above their heads to kill Americans and Israelis and won't if they're not fucked with in Yemen.

This the end of the 2,500 year's of Jews in Yemen.

So no, the Houthi's aren't any different then other extremists with regard to their hatred to Jews. In a sense they are worse. Anti-Semites justify their hatred by saying they are only anti-Israel. The Jews of Yemen are clearly anti-Israel and still being targeted.
 




 If it's disturbing your normal routine of life you should see a psychologist/therapist. Cognitive therapy may also help. 


Do you experience the same level of anxiety in all large gatherings and events or is your anxiety predominant in a religious setting?

If your anxiety is predominant in a religious setting, it may very well be that your anxiety stems from a fear of being judged/guilt on religious observance or someone finding out a dark secret/sin which you are embarrassed about.

 It's illegal for a private citizen to run a tag on a plate. In some states it's a felony even for an officer if it's for unofficial purposes. But a private investigator can access the info without problems.  

There's a website operated by PI's that do this legally online for $40. 




 Activist and blogger Abu Ibrahim Al-Raqqawi (from Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently) tweeted this back in Jan 8, 2015 A group of #ISIS members in #Raqqa are talking among them enthusiastically about the execution of Jordanian pilot, Maath al-Kassassbeh, who was burned to death by #ISIS,

He is usually correct.

 There's an ongoing attempt to re-brand the entire Haram al-Sharif (The Temple Mound) as al-Aqsa, a campain for an overall dejewification of the 'Har Habayis'.


The Dome of the Rock is a shrine (with 7th Century mosaic passages, some anti-Christian) with no special holiness in Islam while 'al-Aqsa' or 'Farthest Mosque' is a 'Masjid' (Mosque) where according to Islam happened the first 'Qiblah'.

They intentionally uses pictures of the 'Qubbat As-Sakhrah' (Dome of the Rock) for 'al-Aqsa'. 




 I don't know if here's the right place to discuss.

My comment was in reference to this;

 No prophet has the authority to go against the Torah in any way

After further thought I agree that in essence you are right. It will never be considered going against the Torah, since the Torah itself commands a person to follow the prophet even when in the situation mentioned before.  




 You may be surprised, your question is in fact discussed in rabbinical literature.  Rabbi Yechiel Michel Epstein (18291908) the 'Aruch Hashulchan' (YD 83:10) raises this hypothetical question and concludes that mermaids are not kosher.

In the Brooklyn Museum (p.276, fig. 310) resides a papyrus scroll numbered Brooklyn 35:1446 which was acquired in the late 19th century by Charles Wilbour. This dates to the reign of Sobekhotep III, the predecessor of Neferhotep I and so the pharaoh who reigned one generation before Moses. This papyrus is a decree by the pharaoh for a transfer of slaves. Of the 95 names of slaves mentioned in the letter, 50% are Semitic in origin. What is more, it lists the names of these slaves in the original Semitic language and then adds the Egyptian name each had been assigned, which is something the Bible records the Egyptians as doing, cf. Josephs name given to him by pharaoh (Genesis 41:45). Some of the Semitic names are biblical and include:- Menahem, Issachar, Asher, and Shiprah (cf. Exodus 1:15-21) - John Fulton

 Why did you hassle me with all of the RaMBaM's thirteen Ikarim when you could have just used the Sefer HaIkarim's three. :)  




 Here we go. I was right. http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/no-jordans-king-abdullah-ii-not-personally-flying-planes-against-isis-1486742 




 Doesn't make sense. Jordan's King is a helicopter pilot and never flew a fixed-wing, let alone a fighter jet.

 It's the cockpit of a blackhawk helicopter. 




 I think these reports are not true.

The photos of the Jordanian King wearing a flight suit was in a non-combatant role in a H-60 black hawk helicopter. He is a helicopter pilot and never flew a fixed-wing, let alone a fighter jet. When Jordan bombed ISIS it was with F-16 fighter jets. 




 Yes. It seems so. The video editing alone would not have been possible to create in a short period of time.    




 Interesting. From what I read on twitter, it seems there's a very big crowd awaiting him at the airport. I had the impression the mood was quite different. - We are all Moaath, Kullnah Moaath,    :)  




 I wrote this brief chronicle of events pertaining to the killing of Jordanian pilot, First Lieutenant Muath al-Kasaesbeh.

Aug 17, 2014 - ISIS posts a video of Haruna Yukawa, a captured Japanese national.

Sep 2014  The King of Jordan   Japan join the US-led coalition against ISIS.

Dec, 24 2014 - ISIS posted a video which purportedly shows a successful hit from a shoulder fired missile on a Jordanian F16 Fighter Jet.
Videos and photos of captured Jordanian Pilot, First Lieutenant Muath al-Kasaesbeh was also uploaded.

Dec 24, 2014 - US Central Command said in a statement that evidence clearly indicates that ISIS did not down the aircraft.

Dec 25, 2014 - The Pilot's father went on Jordanian State Television and pleaded for ISIS to have mercy on his son (later, not sure when, I think Kasasbeh's brother was also on State TV).

Jan 6, 2015 -ISIS released a video titled Message from Muslims to the Family of the Pilot.

Jan 8, 2015 - Activist and blogger Abu Ibrahim Al-Raqqawi tweeted A group of #ISIS members in #Raqqa are talking among them enthusiastically about the execution of Jordanian pilot, Maath al-Kassassbeh, who was burned to death by #ISIS,

Jan 17, 2015 - ISIS released a video titled "Interviews About the Jordanian Pilot".

Jan 19, 2015 - In a video titled A Message to the Government and People of Japan ISIS threatened to kill two Japanese hostages if a ransom of $200 million was not received within a 48 hour deadline (no pun intended).

Jan 24, 2015 - After the 48-hour deadline passed, ISIS released a video titled Slaughtering a Japanese Captive and Appeal of Second To His Family and Government in which Japanese hostage Kenji Goto Jogo stated that his fellow captive Haruna Yukawa was executed.

ISIS then switched their demands and stated the Jordanian will be killed unless Sajida al-Rishawi, an AQI (al-Qaida in Iraq) terrorist held by the Jordanian Gov. is released within the next 72 hours.

January 27, 2015 - In an ISIS released video titled Final Deadline for the Jordanian Government To Release Sjidah al-Rshaw Before Sunset Thursday, Japanese hostage Kenji Goto stated that the Jordanian air force pilot held by ISIS will be killed unless Sajida al-Rishawi, an AQI terrorist held by the Jordanian authorities is released by Sunset.

ISIS intention was to swap Kenji Goto for Sajida al-Rishawi.

January 27-28, 2015 - The Jordanian Government agreed to free Sajida al-Rishawi, but only in exchange for their air force pilot Lieutenant Muadh al-Kasasbeh and only after proof of life was given.

Japan wanted to stick to ISIS demands and have their journalist Kenji Goto freed.

ISIS did not publicly respond to the Jordanian Government.

January 29, 2015 - The deadline set forth by ISIS passed, with Jordanian Officials demanded proof of life of before agreeing to any exchange.

January 31, 2015 - ISIS released a video titled A Message to the Government of Japan with footage of Kenji Goto's dead body.

Feb. 2015 - Jordan threatened to expedite the execution of ISIS and AQI terrorist members who were currently in their custody if Kasasbeh would be killed by ISIS.

Feb. 3, 2015 - ISIS posted a 22-minute long video titled "Healing of the Belivers Chest" which includes footage of the Jordanian air force pilot Kasasbeh doused in flammable material, locked in a cage being burned alive.

Feb. 3, 2015 - Jordanian State TV reported that Jordanian pilot Kasasbeh was killed a month before on January 3, 2015.
It is unclear how they concluded his exact day of death and why it wasn't known or publicized before.

Feb. 3, 2015  The Jordanian Government said that prisoner Sajida al-Rishawi, the woman ISIS wanted in the prisoner exchange and Ziad al-Karbouli, both AQI terrorists, were executed in response to the video.

The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum purchased this from University of South Carolina Newsfilm Library in Columbia, South Carolina in April 1992. The footage was obtained as research for the Museum's Permanent Exhibition.

Notes:

This clip is also on Film ID 235. Film IDs 235 and 236 have the same time codes. Film ID 235 contains more stories than Film ID 236, but the USHMM only has a VHS copy of Film ID 235.


The big question is if Film ID 235 is in this video (Film 237) or there's more footage.

 A check dam doesn't have gates that can be opened. It's a small fixed barrier which reduces the water flow velocity in order for the water to be diverted.

 There are no dams, only [check dams](http://www.appropedia.org/Check_dam)  and diversions. The diversions and check dams actually mitigate flooding in Wadi Gaza.

 and then fill a bucket and hold your head underneath, 

As much as you'd like to think so, the truth is Israel is not in-control of rainfall

The real question is, what is happening in the rest of the area under Israeli water control? Have any Jewish-majority areas in Israel been evacuated because of floods? Any West Bank settlements? These aren't rhetorical questions, I really don't know and you seem to have access to reliable sources.

http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4629185,00.html

"Around 2pm, Southern Police's Negev Mountains rescue unit was called up to help two civilians whose car was stuck in a flood in HaBesor Stream on Route 222."

"Police closed Route 222 and other roads in the area and urged the public not to try to cross Vadis and running streams, even if it seems passable."
 
"Meanwhile, residents of Ein Gedi, Neot HaKikar and Ein Tamar have been stuck in their homes for two days now after flooding in streams in the area led to the closure of Highway 90."

 









 I brought proof that before Israel diverted water into farming and reserves, the Wadi Gaza used to overflow during every winter, bring huge amounts of rainwater and disturb the transportation between the northern and southern parts of the Gaza Strip.  Israels diversion of the watercourse is mitigating the flooding.

It's logical to assume that harsh weather could bring on same conditions as was before the diversion.

 OMG there are no israeli towns flooded and no Israeli farms flooded over the last 12 hours

Wrong.

"Meanwhile, residents of Ein Gedi, Neot HaKikar and Ein Tamar have been stuck in their homes for two days now after flooding in streams in the area led to the closure of Highway 90."

"Two civilians whose vehicle got stuck in the flooding from HaBesor Stream in southern Israel found themselves in need of assistance from an IAF helicopter and police divers on Saturday"

"We hope there isn't an emergency because we can't get out," Shahaf Homeri from Ein Gedi said. "The Arugot Stream is completely flooded. All of the streams south of here - Hever Stream and Tze'elim Stream - are flowing in a raging torrent and there's no way we could cross them. We're stuck from north and south, we can't go anywhere. It's just like we're on an island, you can't get to us." 




 [Wadi Gaza](http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en lat=31.321821 lon=34.490461 z=15 m=b show=/31088593/) is a wetland that has a potential to store the volume of more than 100,000 m3 of surface water.

 It is historically known to overflow during the winter, disturbing the transportation between the northern and southern parts of the Gaza Strip. Before Israel diverted some of the water into farming and reserves the Wadi Gaza used to overflow during every winter and bring huge amounts of rainwater. Now after the diversion the flooding is only after a big storm due to natural causes.

Could flooding possibly be because Hamas won't build proper infrastructure? 




 It came from the same place the flooding did till the late sixties 

 




 Where is the proof there was any release at dams? The flooding was caused by excessive rain.  




 The diversion is mitigating the flooding.

"Interviews with local community of the area clears out that the wetland site till the late sixties (1960's) was much bigger than it is now. Local people says that the wetland site was permanently flooded and that it was like a jungle starting about 100 to 150 m from the railway line..."

 If a nation takes all the water of a watercourse and then releases mass amounts into a dry water way in times of heavy rains it must take proactive steps to prevent damage to other nations.

For the third time, where is the proof Israel released any extra water in to the watercourse? 

Before Israel diverted some of the water into farming and reserves the Wadi Gaza used to overflow during every winter and bring huge amounts of rainwater. Now the flooding is only after a big storm due to natural causes.

"Article 7 makes clear that the "no-harm rule"..

Not only is Israel not violating the "no-harm rule", the diversion is mitigating the flooding.

has the potential to store a volume of more than 100, 000 m3 of surface water." 

"Interviews with local
community of the area clears out that the wetland site till the late sixties
(1960's) was much bigger than it is now. Local people says that the wetland site
was permanently flooded and that it was like a jungle starting about 100 to 150
m from the railway line..."

"Yet it is evident that," Wadi Gaza used to flow in winter and bring huge
amounts of rainwater, disturbing the transportation between the northern and
southern parts of the Gaza Strip" (Goodson, 1999). Also due to interviews with
the local community of the wadi they confirmed that wadi Gaza used to flow
regularly during the winter season for at least two months and used to bring
huge amounts of water."

Could flooding possibly be because Hamas won't build proper infrastructure?

[Like I said before](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2ws8ja/hundreds_of_palestinians_flee_as_israel_opens/cotnmwi), historically, flooding in the wadi was a yearly phenomena.

First they blame Israel for diverting their natural resources and creating a shortage of water. Then, when it  rains an abundant amount of water in a short period of time and the Wadi naturally overflows, Israel is blamed for flooding. Logical?

Could flooding possibly be because Hamas won't build proper infrastructure?

 From a [Times piece](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1120657-6,00.html) on Bill Gates:

It's a rainy night, and Gates is bombing around in his dark blue Lexus. He loves fast cars. When Microsoft was based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in its early years, he bought a Porsche 911 and used to race it in the desert; Paul Allen had to bail him out of jail after one midnight escapade.  





























 Saw that a few days ago and looked in to it.
 

ITs 'source' [Al-Araby](http://www.alaraby.co.uk/society/a911a6c0-0d6a-4450-afe7-138feb8c1838) writes clearly that militias only seized a synagogue. 

The Shrine of Ezra still remains under Shi'a control.

I compared [Al-Araby's photo](http://www.alaraby.co.uk/fullimage/3f9b540d-4039-45e8-a648-9a4779a0938d/a911a6c0-0d6a-4450-afe7-138feb8c1838) to the Shrine of Ezra and found no resemblance. Don't trust me, do it yourself.

 I found the missing pilot in the December 23, 1943 [Aircraft Action Report] (http://imgur.com/7kxWDC7,jorNfTW,upyKYiy,Svesq9E) (4 pages).

It was a F4U-1 like you said not a F4U-1D.

My [source](https://books.google.com/books?id=nV1IAwAAQBAJ pg=PA394 lpg=PA394 dq=F4U+12/25/43 source=bl ots=U9yOOfhg1G sig=NWuahXkkGVxs-IIM4bzmb4fSeVE hl=en sa=X ei=dzvlVNveKoOXNtingdgK ved=0CCQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage q=F4U%2012%2F25%2F43 f=false) is incorrect. 
  




  Corsairs were in the Pacific in 1943, but not F4U-1Ds

On [12/25/**1943**](https://books.google.com/books?id=nV1IAwAAQBAJ pg=PA394 lpg=PA394 dq=F4U+12/25/43 source=bl ots=U9yOOfhg1G sig=NWuahXkkGVxs-IIM4bzmb4fSeVE hl=en sa=X ei=dzvlVNveKoOXNtingdgK ved=0CCQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage q=F4U%2012%2F25%2F43 f=false) a F4U-1D based in Vella Lavella went missing.

So yes, F4U-1Ds were in the Pacific in 1943.
 




 EDIT: I should also mention that this would have been taken in 1945 most likely, or perhaps very late 1944, but definitely not 1943.

EDIT 2: I should also note that the US Army Air Force did not use Corsairs, so this is either a Navy or Marine aircraft, as they were the American users of the type.

You are wrong on *Edit:[the first] (both) assumption(s).

In February 1943 the [307th Operation Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/307th_Operations_Group) of the United States Air Force was assigned to the Thirteenth Air Force and stationed to Solomon Island in the Pacific.
Navy Corsairs were assigned as fighter escort for Air Force B-24 bombers belonging to the 307th Bomb Group.

 Very misleading. Material non-lethal aid not Military aid. 




 The Hoover Dam was actually the first construction site to mandate hard hats on the job.

The Las Vegas Review Journal -  October 28, 1931
 
Nobody will be allowed in the canyon bottom without one of the helmets, henceforth, according to Ed Brockman, supervisor of insurance and safety for the Big Six. 

"And Six Companies is paying the bill.  A helmet for every man!  And more than fifty dozen already have been issued.  Others are en route from the factory, enough to protect the craniums of the army in its entirety.

I guess it was 
"A helmet for every man!"
except politicians...  




 It sure took a lot more then two workers to build those penstock steel pipes.

Quote from pro-Russia writer you linked
 
Back then, the opposition believes, the leak was organized by the FSB security service and was directed at Mr. Nemtsov to discredit the politician.

Who trusts information originating from anonymous FSB/KGB leaks?

 That's a very slanted hit piece

From [buzzfeed](http://www.buzzfeed.com/miriamelder/new-york-observer-stands-by-journalist-who-smeared-kremlin-f#.ip327m7z0q)

The New York Observer is standing by a reporter who has written more than a dozen articles for the outlet with a **slavishly pro-Kremlin bent**, the most recent a story **with no sources** that blames the murder of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov on his love life.

-

The reporter, Mikhail Klikushin, has written 15 articles for the outlet since November 2014, according to the Observers website. **He has no online presence  in English or Russian  beyond the stories he has written for the Observer**, which have also been picked up by other outlets. **A Nexis search turns up no public record of Klikushin**.

-

**Klikushins 15 articles are remarkable in how directly they line up with pro-Russian propaganda points**. The Kremlin regularly issues talking points, either via official statements or, more often, by reports in state-run or Kremlin-friendly media

 Lulek's Rifle

At one of the station stops, my thoughts were interrupted by a group of American soldiers standing on the platform. Noticing the placard on one of the train doors: "Children of Buchenwald Coming Home," written in English and French, some of them got on the train and started talking to us. Lulek was sitting next to me, nibbling on an apple.

-

 One of the soldiers asked him in Yiddish what he would most like right now. Lulek did not hesitate. Pointing to the soldier's rifle, he said he wanted to kill German murderers. The soldier exchanged glances with his friends and got of the train. A few minutes later he returned, carrying a small rifle with the firing mechanism removed. "Kill as many as you can," he said, giving Lulek the gun.

"Greetings We too wanted to pledge our allegiance and commit ourselves while not present there. I am in USA now but we don't
have any arms. But is it possible to commit ourselves as dedicated martyrs anyway while here?
What I'm saying is, to shoot Obama and then get shot ourselves, will it do? That will strike fear in the hearts of infidels."

"In addition, JURABOEY stated that he would harm President Barack Obama if he had the opportunity to do so, but currently does not have the means or an imminent plan to do so."

While admitting that he does not like President Obama because of bis role in killing Muslims through his support of Israel and the recent bombing of ISIL, JURABOEY stated that he would not kill President Obama because of ill
will towards him, but rather because of "Allah." When asked to clarify the nature of his contact with ''H......news.com," JURABOEY stated that he wanted to communicate his approval of the actions of ISIL and establish contact with the group. He added that, if ISIL ordered him to kill President Obama, he would do so.
He further stated that any order to kill the President could come from anyone within ISIL-not necessarily only from ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi-provided that the order had a basis in the Koran and the "Sunna" (the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad). JURABOEV noted that if he received an affirmative or positive response from ISIL to the above-referenced posting on H......news, he would kill President Obama. JURABOEV added that he would also plant a bomb on Coney Island if he were so ordered by ISIL.

This is from the [study](http://vinc.s.free.fr/IMG/palsd_hydro-2.pdf)  Wadi Gaza Wetland Area by [The Mediterranean Wetlands Initiative](http://medwet.org/aboutmedwet/)  


-

"Yet it is evident that," Wadi Gaza used to flow in winter and bring huge
amounts of rainwater, disturbing the transportation between the northern and
southern parts of the Gaza Strip" (Goodson, 1999). Also due to interviews with
the local community of the wadi they confirmed that wadi Gaza used to flow
regularly during the winter season for at least two months and used to bring
huge amounts of water.
Since the early seventies this amount of water started to decrease considerably
due to the built up of [check dams](http://www.appropedia.org/Check_dam) and diversion schemes by Israel on the upper
course of the Wadi (Photo.., Annex 3). 
Since then the volume and duration of flow has decreased much with some
occasional flash floods sweeping down the Wadi bed at wet years. 

-

"Interviews with local
community of the area clears out that the wetland site till the late sixties
(1960's) was much bigger than it is now. Local people says that the wetland site
was permanently flooded and that it was like a jungle starting about 100 to 150
m from the railway line..."

-

Although accurate topographical maps are unavailable, the watershed of [Wadi Gaza [wikimapia.org]](http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en lat=31.412183 lon=34.449949 z=14 m=b show=/27826964/Gaza-Wadi) is estimated to cover more than 3500 km2 of the Northern Negeve Desert and the Hebron Mountains as well as the small catchment in Gaza. The Wadis length from origin to mouth is about 105 km, where the last 9 km of it is located in Gaza Strip. Its name Wadi Gaza is only for the last part which is located in Gaza. Wadi Gaza has two main tributes one is [Wadi Alshariah [wikimapia.org]](http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en lat=31.358914 lon=34.569340 z=13 m=b) which collects water from the Hebron Mountains in the West Bank and the other is [Wadi Alshallala [wikimapia.org]](http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en lat=31.321821 lon=34.490461 z=15 m=b show=/31088593/) which collects water from the Northern Negeve highest.

Conclusion: There are no dams and the diversions mitigate flooding.

 Just a thought that, if you can count them, you can shut them down, continuously, until they stop sprouting new heads.

Pro ISIS Asawitiri media's 104th Twitter account was just suspended. Shutting them down doesn't do much except make a few armchair twitter anti-jihadists feel good about themselves for mass reporting. 

I don't know how they got the number 46,000. I'd think it's impossible to give a conclusive number of how many 'real' supporters they have on twitter because many twitter accounts are actually run by terrorism analysts and government agency's for analysis, to gain access to their online forums and for other reasons. 
























 Agree. 

Al Jazeera's Jane Arraf tweeted that they used a bulldozer to level the winged bull statue. I think that statue might be an imitation. The British Museum has one and it's partner is now in the Metropolitan Museum, New York.

See http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/c/colossal_statue_winged_bull.aspx

 It seems the PLO is not happy with this.

They [decided today to end security cooperation with Israel](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2y22ko/the_palestinian_liberation_organisations_central/). 


This leaves the 92,000 Palestinians who worked for Israelis and had a 55% average increase in salary over their peers in the Palestinian territories  at risk of losing their jobs.

It's hard for me to comprehend the sick logic behind this .

 Ukraine voluntarily gave up its nuclear weapons in exchange for 'territorial integrity guarantees' from NATO including America... and Russia.

The [agreement](http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_25457.htm) cites, 

NATO vows to respect Ukraine's sovereignty, i.e. not to invade it, and it's member states will "consult together" if the country is threatened.

It would be a non issue 'if' American troops were involved in protecting Ukraine's sovereignty. While Russia must abide to the NATO vows and not attack Ukraine's sovereignty. This is why on 1 April 2014, NATO decided to suspend practical co-operation with Russia. 




 Why would a Palestinian work for the

92,000 Palestinians disagree with you. They worked in Israels private sector until now and were happy with it. The decision to stop security cooperation's with Israel is PLO politics.  

Israeli government 

Most if not all work in the private sector

whom withholds $100,000,000 in tax revenue

Although I disagree with Israels practice, Hamas has 209.7 million dollars of electricity payments taken from Palestinians that rightfully belong to Israel's electricity company

thus punishing millions of people.

It's mostly Hamas who is punishing the people

Seems that the 92k workers are fed up of the gangster liar Israeli government

You are wrong 92,000 times. 









 This means 92,000 Palestinians who worked for Israelis and had a 55% average increase in salary to their peers in the Palestinian territories are now at risk of losing their jobs.

 Cattle walking the last mile to this slaughterhouse are treated to this dazzling, but incongruous display of light before the end in Gross-Umstadt near Darmstadt, West Germany, on November 29, 1962. The chandelier came from a nearby factory that didn't have room to assemble it there, so they decided to assemble it in this slaughterhouse. The name of the Arab ruler who ordered the 532 bulb chandelier made up of 200,000 separate parts is a secret. Also, a secret is the price he paid for it.

  There are two different straits important to the Battle of Leyte Gulf. One is Surigao Strait, at the southern entrance to Leyte Gulf. The other is San Bernadino Strait, between Luzon and Samar, which you must pass through to enter Leyte Gulf from the east if you are coming from the west (Leyte Gulf opens east and south).

You are correct. Here's from World War II War Diaries

 I have no clue! I'm just as dumbfounded as you are. 
























 Interesting detail. It wasn't until December  1944 that the sinking of the Musashi was confirmed through prisoner interrogation. 

From World War II War Diaries. [Image (last paragraph)](http://imgur.com/uYgFaDq) 

Reports of prisoners of war interrogation on the South-west Pacific indicated that the MUSASHI, new Japanese battleship, had been definitely sunk in the Sibuyan Sea by THIRD Fleet carrier attck on 24 October. The reports also confirmed previous sinking claimed by the Commander THIRD Fleet and confirmed extensive damage to the remain-ing Japanse battleships which were now either in navy yards under repair or operating at reduced efficiency.

 What a joke

Russia's President Vladimir Putin has called for an end to "shameful" political killings in Russia. 









 Update:

The speaker in Ukraine's parliament said 32 workers were killed in an explosion at coal mine in eastern Ukraine on Wednesday, **but later said he can only confirm one death**. 










































































 In the spirit of transparency Jeb Bush dumped all his emails online

You can search here: http://jebbushemails.com/email/search 




 When people write about the phenomenon, they tend to focus on rocknroll, but a lot of Russian music that people had grown up with was also banned. Theres a Ukrainian singer called Pyotr Leshchenko  a Russian emigre who specialised in South American tango and gypsy music. After the second world war, when his music was outlawed, people would have to tune in to stations like Radio Tehran to hear his songs. The authorities set themselves too huge a task ultimately. You had popular Russian tunes that were classified as criminal songs, but they werent really. They were just regarded as low culture.

Title from information supplied by American Folklife Center staff. Title was formerly "Piegan Indian, Mountain Chief, having his voice recorded by ethnologist Frances Densmore," but American Folklife Center staff determined that the photo shows a playback horn on the cylinder recorder, so Mountain Chief and Densmore are listening rather than recording (12/2013).

 The tragic death of Ahmed al-Jumaili had nothing to do with Islamophobia.  Does Max Fisher do any research before publishing things?

Alia Salem added 2 new photos.

March 5 at 9:55pm  Dallas, TX  Edited  

Assalamu Alaikum

Update regarding shooting death of Ahmed Al Jumaili in North Dallas:

I had an opportunity to meet with the family of Ahmed to discuss the incident that led to his death last night. 

Imam Shpendim Nadzaku and Attorney Shayan Elahi accompanied me in the 2 meetings we held. May Allah reward both of them. Their support was invaluable. Here is what we learned:

-Ahmed Al Jumaili, 36, just immigrated from Iraq 20 days ago

 - The perpetrators were 5-6 young AfAm males

 - The shot that killed Ahmed entered the side of a pickup truck bed and cleared through the other side striking Ahmed in the chest as he hid behind the truck. *see picture*

- There was nothing said to Ahmed or his wife and her brother by the perpetrators in advance of the shots. Including no verbal insults or derogatory slurs.

- They do not wear clothing that would indicate their ethnic or religious identity and Ahmed's wife, Zahra, was wearing a winter hat that concealed her hijab.

- The family is understandably traumatized and is in need of community support. Emotionally as well as financially. They are refugees from Iraq and only Mohamed, Zahra's father, is working.
After meeting with them I do not believe there is enough evidence to indicate that this was a hate crime. Thanks to Sana Syed, the PIO and our contact for the City of Dallas, I was able to speak with Major Jeff Cotner with DPD Homicide and here is what I learned:

- They have not completely ruled out a hate crime but the evidence does not indicate Ahmed was specifically targeted.

- The perpetrators have not been caught but they have some concrete leads. If anyone is interested in sponsoring a reward to help find these murderers they would be interested to discuss.

- They need the community's help is submitting information that could lead to the arrests.

In my assessment I truly believe that the DPD is doing everything they can to solve this crime completely. We have exchanged contact info and he was very grateful for our support.

Attached is an image of the bullet exit hole that left the truck and struck Ahmed in the chest resulting in his death as well as a lovely picture of Ahmed and his wife Zahra.

"Inna Lillahi wa Inna Lillayhi Raja'oon - Verily we are from God and to Him we shall all return." Please pray for this family. This death was so violent and traumatic. We should rally around them in this difficult time.
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns that I may help with.

While getting ready to fish for porgy several miles offshore, A. L. Kahn, a manufacturer, tossed an anchor from his small motorboat. The anchor went down and down - and right into one of the gills of the giant Manta. After a battle of several hours a coast guard vessel came along and hoisted Kahn, his motorboat and the devil-fish aboard and brought them to port. Kahn (now Captain Kahn) **had the creature stuffed** and became a showman. Says it beats the manufacturing business all hollow.

 How do they know it was a model?

The newspapers from 1933-34 write it was the actual fish, he just stuffed it and hung it up for exhibition.

 Arabs + nameless Delaware plates +  trespassing on multiple synagogue property's + taking pictures + acting suspicious =?

You are singling out one factor out of a big equation, which I never did.

  No real terrorist is going to arouse suspicion by walking around taking pictures of the outside of the building

I see you got the 'real' terrorists all figured out. One word, Mumbai (this is just one example off the top of my head).  




 For ten hours redditors were commenting on this post [without having a clue about the circumstances of this criminal event](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/2yc4sv/nypd_steps_up_patrols_after_two_suspicious_men/cp8ng98), now I should be listening to you? 




 nothing they did was illegal

They drove illegally with nameless Delaware plates.  Typical, commenting without knowing the facts.
 




 And none of the redditors here knew they drove with nameless Delaware plates...  




 It's a active criminal investigation. The NYPD is looking for the individuals who drove illegally with nameless Delaware plates and acted suspiciously. I posted it in the hope that a good citizen will be able to help the NYPD identify them.   




 ISIS supposedly destroyed the Palace of Ashurnasirpal II.

Here's a link to what's in The British Museum from his Palace

 It was stuffed.

 There's no conclusive evidence that it's not real

 There's a difference between fear and caution. 
 




 I didn't make it, it was created by terrorists. 




 It was caught in 1933 so this photo is from 1933 and on. 




 Do you know more than the rest of us to be so sure?

No. I consider them suspicious, I am uncertain of their motive. You on the other hand claim they are above suspicion. 




 Do you think [this](http://imgur.com/9Mi05FH) is fake?

https://archive.org/stream/louisianaconserv29depa#page/4/mode/2up

It's  

so turgid, with the wings sticking out and the cephalic lobes all standing up like that 




 That's fine with me, I hope everything is OK by you. 




 The process of stuffing can also explain the rigidness. Why come up with new theory's?  

 




 I also dislike it.. 




 It seems from all the down-votes that they haven't. Some people don't want to hear the truth because they don't want their illusions destroyed. 









 Given what is going on in Europe and the Middle East, if this Arab had two functioning brain cells he'd know they should clear a synagogue visit ahead of time if they're just curious and don't want to raise suspicion. 

As for all the downvotes, sometimes people don't want to hear the truth because they don't want their illusions destroyed.

 He is mistaken. **A. L. Kahn had the captured manta stuffed and hung it up for exhibition.**


This appeared in many newspapers in 1933-1934

But the star of the exhibition is a local luminary - a 5,000-pound devil fish that proves New York's most amazing fish story.

While getting ready to fish for porgy several miles offshore, A. L. Kahn, a manufacturer, tossed an anchor from his small motorboat. The anchor went down and down - and right into one of the gills of the giant Manta. After a battle of several hours a coast guard vessel came along and hoisted Kahn, his motorboat and the devil-fish aboard and brought them to port. Kahn (now Captain Kahn) **had the creature stuffed** and became a showman. Says it beats the manufacturing business all hollow.

A Giant Manta Devil Fish became entangled in the anchor rope of Captain A. L. Kahns fishing boat while he was angling just off the shore of New Jersey, almost capsizing the heavy boat.
A Coast Guard vessel came to the rescue, and killed the 5,000-pound monster Manta Birostris with 22 shots from a high-powered rifle. The sail-like fish has been mounted and placed on exhibition by Captain Kahn.
An 18-inch baby Manta was born shortly after the mother fish was dragged ashore. These huge rays are seldom seen, since they live in the deepest parts of the sea.

This signed photo postcard shows "THE GREAT MANTA" that was captured by Captain A.L. Kahn on August 26, 1933. The huge ray was reported to have weighed over 5,000 pounds and measured more than 20 feet across the wing. The critter was caught when it became fouled in the anchor line of the "MISS PENSACOLA II" and was unable to free itself. The ray was towed to Feuerbach and Hansen's Marina in Brielle, New Jersey where it was hoisted ashore with a travel lift.

 Devarim - Deuteronomy - Chapter 28:6

You shall be blessed when you come, and you shall be blessed when you depart.

The Talmud in Bava Metzia 107a says, the way you 'depart' from the world should be like the way you 'come in' to the world, just like you 'come in' to the world **without sin** (blessed), so too your 'departure' from the world [should be] without sin (blessed)

but that does not seem related to adam and eve.

The Talmud seems to imply that people are not born with deficiency's from prior sins including Adams

But like I brought before, the Tchebiner Rabbi has a different interpretation for the Talmud in Bava Metzia 107a

Superficially this text seems to imply that one can't come in to this world with sin

There's a famous RaShaSh on this

   

(This RaShaSh is very controversial and some believe it's a forgery)

The [Tchebiner Rov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dov_Berish_Weidenfeld) refutes this and argues that the  passage actually is proof that one CAN come in to this world with sin

 According to the latest exit polls, President Obama lost the Israeli election

The Talmud in Bava Metzia 107a seems to disagree

 he's making shit up


What..

A bipartisan probe is being launched by a U.S. Senate Investigatory committee, designed to look into the funding of a not-for-profit group that has been trying to oust Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

-

New Israel Fund and its social change and political lobbying organization - known as SHATIL - have received more than $1 million from the State Department under a program designed to create political change, reform, and activism in the Middle East.

-

 OneVoice Movement, a group in Washington which has received $350,000 from the State Department. Until recently the group was headed by a veteran diplomat from the Clinton years.

-

A subsidiary of OneVoice is the Israel-based Victory 15 campaign, itself guided by top operatives of Obamas White House runs, which seeks to replace the government of Israel.

-

Jeremy Bird, Obamas previous campaign director, arrived in Israel to help direct V15, which was trying to reach a million households in an effort to remove Netanyahu. OneVoice is prohibited from directly targeting Netanyahu, but its Israeli partner V15 can carry out the campaign.

Update regarding shooting death of Ahmed Al Jumaili in North Dallas:

I had an opportunity to meet with the family of Ahmed to discuss the incident that led to his death last night. 

Imam Shpendim Nadzaku and Attorney Shayan Elahi accompanied me in the 2 meetings we held. May Allah reward both of them. Their support was invaluable. Here is what we learned:

-Ahmed Al Jumaili, 36, just immigrated from Iraq 20 days ago

 - The perpetrators were 5-6 young AfAm males

 - The shot that killed Ahmed entered the side of a pickup truck bed and cleared through the other side striking Ahmed in the chest as he hid behind the truck. *see picture*

- There was nothing said to Ahmed or his wife and her brother by the perpetrators in advance of the shots. Including no verbal insults or derogatory slurs.

- They do not wear clothing that would indicate their ethnic or religious identity and Ahmed's wife, Zahra, was wearing a winter hat that concealed her hijab.

- The family is understandably traumatized and is in need of community support. Emotionally as well as financially. They are refugees from Iraq and only Mohamed, Zahra's father, is working.
After meeting with them I do not believe there is enough evidence to indicate that this was a hate crime. Thanks to Sana Syed, the PIO and our contact for the City of Dallas, I was able to speak with Major Jeff Cotner with DPD Homicide and here is what I learned:

- They have not completely ruled out a hate crime but the evidence does not indicate Ahmed was specifically targeted.

- The perpetrators have not been caught but they have some concrete leads. If anyone is interested in sponsoring a reward to help find these murderers they would be interested to discuss.

- They need the community's help is submitting information that could lead to the arrests.

In my assessment I truly believe that the DPD is doing everything they can to solve this crime completely. We have exchanged contact info and he was very grateful for our support.

Attached is an image of the bullet exit hole that left the truck and struck Ahmed in the chest resulting in his death as well as a lovely picture of Ahmed and his wife Zahra.

"Inna Lillahi wa Inna Lillayhi Raja'oon - Verily we are from God and to Him we shall all return." Please pray for this family. This death was so violent and traumatic. We should rally around them in this difficult time.
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns that I may help with.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns that I may help with.

Apparently Yemenite girls DO wear Hijab head coverings and many even wear Niqab/Burqas.

 Is there any plans for re-float the wrecked MUSASHI? 




 In case anyone is interested.

It wasn't until December 1944 that the sinking of the Musashi was confirmed through prisoner interrogation. 

From World War II War Diaries. [Image (last paragraph)](http://imgur.com/uYgFaDq) 

Reports of prisoners of war interrogation on the South-west Pacific indicated that the MUSASHI, new Japanese battleship, had been definitely sunk in the Sibuyan Sea by THIRD Fleet carrier attck on 24 October. The reports also confirmed previous sinking claimed by the Commander THIRD Fleet and confirmed extensive damage to the remain-ing Japanse battleships which were now either in navy yards under repair or operating at reduced efficiency.

 Julie Sheldon was featured in the Jun 6, 1955 [LIFE Magazine ](https://books.google.com/books?id=hlYEAAAAMBAJ pg=PA177 lpg=PA177 dq=In+1953,+when+she+was+only+10+days+old,+julie+sheldon+of+los+angeles+was+taken+into+a+pool source=bl ots=TSAg0Ld5AG sig=9ZZ6x0Ai6HGeOd45cc2Gwqpl0Mc hl=en sa=X ei=i9QBVc6aM4TBggSEv4CABQ ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage q=In%201953%2C%20when%20she%20was%20only%2010%20days%20old%2C%20julie%20sheldon%20of%20los%20angeles%20was%20taken%20into%20a%20pool f=false)

**Julie Sheldon, who swam at 9 weeks, now plays under water at 19 months**

-

In 1953, when she was only 10 days old, Julie Sheldon of Los Angles was taken into a pool by her grandmother, Mrs. Jen Loven,  and given her first swimming lesson. At 9 weeks (left), already established as the youngest swimmer in the world, Julie could swim for distances up to 10 feet as her grandmother walked closely behind (LIFE, Jan 18, 1954).

-

Today, an accomplished swimmer of 19 months, Julie has also become an underwater baby. In the outdoor pool on Hollywood Boulevard where her grandmother keeps toys resting on the bottom in the 4-foot depth, Julie submerges for as long as seven seconds and intently plays with everything from a tricycle (above) to a teet-totter.

 **What were Bone Records?**



Bone records, or roentgenizdat, were music recordings on an unlikely medium: discarded x-ray plates. During the Second World War in Eastern Europe, vinyl became an extremely expensive way of producing records. Therefore, during the 1930s and 40s, the lack of available materials caused both labels and individual music enthusiasts to search for new ways of production. Music became available on all types of wax and film, but most notably photographic film and x-ray plates. The plates were favored because of their thicker density.


Demand only grew in the USSR in the 1950s when records and tape recorders were in increasingly short supply and music was growing as a necessary escape from political tension. Young people in Eastern Europe realized that they could duplicate records using a converted phonograph and create an imprint of a record on discarded x-ray plates. Used x-ray plates could be purchased for next to nothing from hospitals and medical facilities once they were no longer needed. Then they could easily be cut into discs with scissors. Altered phonograph machines using wax disc cutters and machines like the voice-o-graph could produce grooves in the film that were nearly undetectable. Soviet society promoted science and technology and search of knowledge. It was often students who were studying engineering who would be the ones creating these records.
Termed rock on bones (rok na kostiakh) or rock on ribs (rok na rebrakh), the records became a visual symbol for underground Soviet resistance and rebellion. The quality of these bone records was not very good at all, but the price was right. They were rather flimsy and would warm and break easily, but they would only cost a ruble or two.
In 1950s Russia, women usually controlled the family budget. On a days lunch or drink allowance, one could purchase an underground pressing. Better quality recordings would require a week or twos worth of allowance.

-


**Music Censorship in the Soviet Union**

In the years after World War Two, Stalin tried to get rid of any American influence on Soviet civilization. His first target in the 1950s was American jazz music. Artists like John Coltrane and Thelonius Monk were never to be heard by Soviet ears.
Jazz music turned to rock-and-roll and Bill Haleys 1954 Rock Around the Clock was deemed a threat to civilization. The x-ray press system was discovered by the Soviet government in 1958 and was promptly made illegal. The same was true for the samizdat, which was the self-publishing means for writers.
In 1962, a Soviet paper in Lithuania said of the Beatles and Elviss music: These pearls of Western culture are part of an imperialist state policy corrupting the masses, promoting low animal instincts, and dulling the mind. Similarly, in 1961, an East German newspaper said that Chubby Checkers Twist was being used by imperialists in West Germany to rally the young people for war.
It wasnt only the records that were censored by the Soviet government  rockbands were disbanded and rock concerts were raided. A task force of music patrols was started by the government in 1959 to control illegal music activity and the largest ring of roentgenizdat production was broken up the same year.

-

**Melodiya**

Melodiya, the only official record label of the USSR, was founded in 1964. Melodiya produced mainly classical music and recordings of famous actors, as well as records with fairy tales for children. Melodiya had firm policies against protest rock. They later produced records of many of the pop and rock artists of the 60s and 70s, but not until years after they were originally released, and at an extremely high mark-up. Melodiya was state-owned until the fall of the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989.

-

**Government Response**


The Soviet government attempted to flood the market of bone records by creating unplayable records in an effort to kill the demand. They would either make records that would physically mess with players, or the would include vocal recordings in the middle of the music saying things like, You like rock and roll? F**k you, anti-Soviet slime! There were about 10 individuals who were suspected of distributing bone records who were sent to the gulags (the Soviet labor camps).

-

**The Music**

The most popular productions were Western artists  from early jazz to the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and David Bowie. Soviet rock artists such as Yuri Shevchuk ran into problems with the KGB. Melodiya produced an official record by the band Aquarium that was only approved by the label as a reaction to Western concerns in USSR censorship.

-

**Death**

The two main factors in the disappearance of bone records were the government reconciliation and the replacement technologies. As reel-to-reel tape recorders gained in prevalence in the 1970s, they were able to successfully replace the system of x-ray recordings. The x-ray records had an extremely poor sound quality and were produced by select individuals. Tape recorders provided a better quality with easier and neater production. One source called tape recorders the Bit Torrent of the 1970s. At the end of the Cold War, during the perestroika era of restructuring in the USSR, censorship of music lightened up and the need for underground production of music died.

X-ray records were metaphors par excellence of imaginary elsewheres  the ingenious experimental cultures that were both internal and external to the body of the Soviet state  Alexei Yurchak, Everything was forever, until it was no more: the last Soviet generation

Young people in Eastern Europe realized that they could duplicate records using a converted phonograph and create an imprint of a record on discarded x-ray plates. Used x-ray plates could be purchased for next to nothing from hospitals and medical facilities once they were no longer needed. Then they could easily be cut into discs with scissors. Altered phonograph machines using wax disc cutters and machines like the voice-o-graph could produce grooves in the film that were nearly undetectable. Soviet society promoted science and technology and search of knowledge. It was often students who were studying engineering who would be the ones creating these records.
Termed rock on bones (rok na kostiakh) or rock on ribs (rok na rebrakh), the records became a visual symbol for underground Soviet resistance and rebellion. The quality of these bone records was not very good at all, but the price was right. They were rather flimsy and would warm and break easily, but they would only cost a ruble or two.
In 1950s Russia, women usually controlled the family budget. On a days lunch or drink allowance, one could purchase an underground pressing. Better quality recordings would require a week or twos worth of allowance.

**Music Censorship in the Soviet Union**

In the years after World War Two, Stalin tried to get rid of any American influence on Soviet civilization. His first target in the 1950s was American jazz music. Artists like John Coltrane and Thelonius Monk were never to be heard by Soviet ears.
Jazz music turned to rock-and-roll and Bill Haleys 1954 Rock Around the Clock was deemed a threat to civilization. The x-ray press system was discovered by the Soviet government in 1958 and was promptly made illegal. The same was true for the samizdat, which was the self-publishing means for writers.
In 1962, a Soviet paper in Lithuania said of the Beatles and Elviss music: These pearls of Western culture are part of an imperialist state policy corrupting the masses, promoting low animal instincts, and dulling the mind. Similarly, in 1961, an East German newspaper said that Chubby Checkers Twist was being used by imperialists in West Germany to rally the young people for war.
It wasnt only the records that were censored by the Soviet government  rockbands were disbanded and rock concerts were raided. A task force of music patrols was started by the government in 1959 to control illegal music activity and the largest ring of roentgenizdat production was broken up the same year.

-

**Melodiya**

Melodiya, the only official record label of the USSR, was founded in 1964. Melodiya produced mainly classical music and recordings of famous actors, as well as records with fairy tales for children. Melodiya had firm policies against protest rock. They later produced records of many of the pop and rock artists of the 60s and 70s, but not until years after they were originally released, and at an extremely high mark-up. Melodiya was state-owned until the fall of the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989.

-

**Government Response**


The Soviet government attempted to flood the market of bone records by creating unplayable records in an effort to kill the demand. They would either make records that would physically mess with players, or the would include vocal recordings in the middle of the music saying things like, You like rock and roll? F**k you, anti-Soviet slime! There were about 10 individuals who were suspected of distributing bone records who were sent to the gulags (the Soviet labor camps).

-

**The Music**

The most popular productions were Western artists  from early jazz to the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and David Bowie. Soviet rock artists such as Yuri Shevchuk ran into problems with the KGB. Melodiya produced an official record by the band Aquarium that was only approved by the label as a reaction to Western concerns in USSR censorship.

-

**Death**

The two main factors in the disappearance of bone records were the government reconciliation and the replacement technologies. As reel-to-reel tape recorders gained in prevalence in the 1970s, they were able to successfully replace the system of x-ray recordings. The x-ray records had an extremely poor sound quality and were produced by select individuals. Tape recorders provided a better quality with easier and neater production. One source called tape recorders the Bit Torrent of the 1970s. At the end of the Cold War, during the perestroika era of restructuring in the USSR, censorship of music lightened up and the need for underground production of music died.

X-ray records were metaphors par excellence of imaginary elsewheres  the ingenious experimental cultures that were both internal and external to the body of the Soviet state  Alexei Yurchak, Everything was forever, until it was no more: the last Soviet generation

 When people write about the phenomenon, they tend to focus on rocknroll, but a lot of Russian music that people had grown up with was also banned. Theres a Ukrainian singer called Pyotr Leshchenko  a Russian emigre who specialised in South American tango and gypsy music. After the second world war, when his music was outlawed, people would have to tune in to stations like Radio Tehran to hear his songs. The authorities set themselves too huge a task ultimately. You had popular Russian tunes that were classified as criminal songs, but they werent really. They were just regarded as low culture.

 It seems I am being misunderstood (maybe it's my poor English). 

If I'd be looking to write in another language I wouldn't be on an English-language forum. All I wrote was that I'm more proficient in Hebrew than English. I did not write which language is my mother-tongue. In fact it is not Hebrew as you assumed. My only disagreement is (if there is any) in quoted Hebrew text. It seems people downvote any Hebrew text regardless if it's written by the OP or it's a quote from the original text. And it seems even after a request for translation is fulfilled it's ignored...  

So my question is do they truly want it translated? If yes, why downvotes and no interaction after translation. If no, why downvotes on the qouted Hebrew text.

If the OP quoted Maimonides in its original Arabic text would he/she be downvoted? I doubt it. It's telling..

sometimes people are not comfortable repeatedly asking for translations, explanations and such. Especially when they feel it's something they should already know

-
[u/WhatMichelleDoes](https://www.reddit.com/user/WhatMichelleDoes)
 many answered that they would if they could understand what was going on.

Please understand, it's very hard and time consuming to translate Hebrew text to English, even harder Hebrew scholarly text. It's not a simple task. 

When someone **does** offer their time and effort I'd expect the community to show their appreciation by interacting or at least upvoting the comment.

I believe this is not the case (I'm pretty new to Reddit and /r/Judaism and may be wrong with my assumption).

Look at it this way; Here I am on Reddit writing in English, a language which I am less proficient than Hebrew, while you are more advantaged in your English language skills. Should I complain? No, my poor grammar is nothing but my own fault not yours. Same should be when someone writes some Hebrew or Jewish phrases and concept..

**The minuscule discomfort that you may experience from repeatedly asking for translations is by far outweighed by the effort put in to the translation.** 
 
I think it's a very cheap and selfish complaint. Ask and you will be answered.
 
**Also, explain why someone should put in this extreme effort if their hard work is not properly appreciated?**

Here's an example of a comment with Hebrew/Jewish phrases and concepts [[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/2zapfj/do_jews_believe_in_original_sin/cpiekr6) [[2]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/2zapfj/do_jews_believe_in_original_sin/cpi1877), both downvoted to **0**


[I was then asked to explain in English](https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/2zapfj/do_jews_believe_in_original_sin/cpieaof), [which I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/2zapfj/do_jews_believe_in_original_sin/cpieaof), no upvotes or further interaction..

**Is this fair?** **Do you think this encourages more translations?**

Edit: My only disagreement is (if there is any) in quoted Hebrew text. It seems people downvote any Hebrew text regardless if it's written by the OP or it's a quote from the original text. And it seems even after a request for translation is fulfilled it's ignored...  

So my question is do they truly want it translated? If yes, why downvotes and no interaction after translation. If no, why downvotes on the qouted Hebrew text.

If the OP quoted Maimonides in its original Arabic text would he/she be downvoted? I doubt it. It's telling..

The Shulchan Aruch (11:14) records such a practice, and the Rama (11:3) advises that this be done. The Mishna Berura (11:18), however, cites opinions forbidding tying knots at the end of the Tzitzit strings, and rules that one should refrain from doing so if the strings are properly woven such that unraveling is unlikely to occur.

No. The Torah predates Islam.

This is what [Maimonides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides) -    (1135c.-1204) wrote about Islam


Muslims are not idol worshipers at all, it has ceased to exist in their mouths and hearts, and they attribute the proper oneness to God with no blemish. 

Because they lie about us, and falsely accuse us of saying God has a son (did Maimonides mean Uzayr - Ezra http://quran.com/9/30 ?), it does not mean we can lie about them and say they are idol worshipers 

And if someone should say that they worship in an idolatrous shrine [the Kaaba], and an idol is hidden inside which their ancestors worshiped  this does not matter. 

The hearts of those who bow down toward it today are directed to Heaven [towards God] 

Regarding the Muslims today, all of them including women and children have ceased to believe in idolatry.

 That's an assumption on your part. The Fire Department has not suggested this. Besides many use timers. 




 autofill.. 
























 about practices like the one that caused the fire

-

 Leaving hotplates on for a day at a time though

The Jewish Sabbath started at around 7 pm in New York and the news reports state the fire was at 12 am, meaning the hot-plate was on for less then 6 hours. This tragic event was caused by an electronic malfunction not overheating from overuse.  Using a tragedy as a platform for hate is despicable. C'mon, at least wait an till they bury their dead.. 

[/r/FDNY](https://www.reddit.com/r/FDNY/) encourage fire safety, don't fan the flames of hatred.
 














 31. Three bodies were found on the lower shelf of storeroom A-111 clad in blues and jerseys. This storeroom was open to fresh water pump room, A-109, which presumably was the battle station assigned to these men. The emergency rations at this station had been consumed and a manhole to the fresh water tanks below the pumps had been removed. A calendar which was found in this compartment had an **"X" marked on each date from December 7, 1941 to December 23, 1941 inclusive**.

It was a very difficult  salvage job and took time.


* a. Install a cofferdam patch over torpedo damage on the port side at frame 43-52. 

* b. Install a cofferdam patch over the damage to midship area, port side, frame 61 - 97.

* c. Isolate steering engine room area by watertight doors.

* d. Pump out the vessel, using about ten large pumps (10") to gain control over the inflow of water.

* e. After gaining control, stop off leaks into the hull and improve tightness of patches, watertight doors, watertight covers, etc.

* f. Apply Air pressure to tanks and voids on the port side to empty or partially empty those that were ruptured. 

* g. Pump out all intact tanks and voids on the port side and empty starboard tanks and voids correspondingly.

* h. Apply air pressure to flooded areas aft in order to reduce the amount of water in those areas.

* i. Remove all weight possible, such as water, oil, stores, provisions, meat, ammunition, personal belongings, 
furniture, trash, wreckage, etc.

The above is in general the story of the salvage of the West Virginia, **which may well be designated as a most difficult successfully completed**. All hands assigned to the work performed their part intelligently, co-operatively and effectively. A successful outcome was never in doubt.

 I think it would be a good idea to try to get holocaust survivors to agree to do AMAs (someone else could do the typing). 












































 having sarin and using are two totally different things


Not according to International law. It doesn't have to be weaponized to be considered illegal.

"The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the implementing body of the Chemical Weapons Convention, classifies sarin under Schedule 1, a class reserved for lethal chemicals with few, if any, legitimate, applications."

-

The sarin Tokyo subway attacks killed only a dozen people despite it being released in a confined location with high purity

They were amateurs and were rushed and you are wrong on your assumption that it was high purity.

-

"Fortunately, the low purity of the sarin solution used in the March 20, 1995 attack and the crude delivery method reduced the number of casulties, and the presence of the pungent solvent acetonitrile allowed many commuters to detect the presence of the otherwise odorless nerve agent and flee the scene before absorbing a lethal dose. The use of plasctic bags containing the sarin mixture rather than the far more efficient method of aerosol dispersal also reduced the number of casualties... The death toll could have been far worse if the cult had had the time to prepare the attack."

-

Sadam used sarin against Iranian soldiers causing tens of thousands of casualties. Also some 3,200 to 5,000 Kurds were killed.



Well thank god the iraqis didnt weaponize fishing boats and have them shot out of cannons..

-

You wrote


even unexploded bombs from ww1. The difference is these couldnt be used for anythign 

suggesting Sadam's WMDs were less lethal then WWI munitions. 

I brought proof that mustard gass from WWI was still active in 2010, that it has a long shelf life. Sarcasm will not diminish the truth

You do realize that any attempt to shoot a rusting shell would cause said shell to explode in the barrel of the artillery piece, right?

Like I wrote before, the possession of the chemical agent is illegal whether it's weaponized or not. 

Had you read the report you'd know that some shells were still in good condition 

Also it is easy to refill a new shell or convert it to a crude bomb 




  Without Iraq, a large geographic barrier is present to U.S. military maneuvers.

The US military presence is well represented in the region even without Iraq.  Your assumption is absurd and not factual.

 Iraq has a lot of grownups capable of making decisions

And they made one...

Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Malaki practically begged Obama for several thousand military personnel to remain, to train Iraqi forces and to help track down insurgents. But he stated that the Status of Forces Agreement that gave US soldiers immunity from prosecution under Iraqi law was unpopular in Iraq (especially in light of the reveal of abuses by US military contractors etc. of Iraqi citizens rights) . Obama wouldn't agree and decided pull all troops from Iraq.

 It's not up to the US who runs Iraq

That's not the reason why Obama pulled the troops from Iraq. 




 Also unions had an over abundance of Jews. I got a kick out of looking through Library of Congress archive and finding Yiddish signs in practically every picture of union demonstrations.

 There are many tales in Iraqi and Muslim culture of the Tigris River turning red with blood.

Here's some

In 1258 Mongols under the command of Hulagu Khan sacked Baghdad, destroying the House of Wisdom, the leading library in the leading intellectual center of the Arab world.

The House of Wisdom, founded in the eighth century, contained countless precious documents accumulated over five hundred years. Survivors said so many books were thrown into the river that the waters of the **Tigris** ran black with ink; others said the **waters were red from blood**.

-

Khalid ibn al-Walid at the [Battle of Mu'tah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalid_ibn_al-Walid)

....Then Khalid raised his hands in supplication and prayed to Allah:

"O Lord! If You give us victory, I shall see that
no enemy warrior is left alive **until their river runs with
their blood!**" 2

The Muslims renewed their assaults with greater fury; and Allah gave them victory. Early in the afternoon the imperial army was shattered and its soldiers fled from the battlefield. Thousands lay dead, especially in, and on the bank of, the river whose sandy bed was red with their blood.

As the Persian army fled from the battlefield, Khalid launched his cavalry after it. "Do not kill them", he ordered the cavalry. "Bring them back alive." 3 The bed of the river was soaked with blood ... but the river was not "running with blood" as Khalid had pledged!



1. Tabari: Vol. 2, p. 561.
2. Tabari: Vol. 2, p. 561.
3. Ibid.....

-

....Furthermore, to call what happened a "killing of prisoners" is an oversimplification. Normally they would have been killed in the pursuit, as had happened before and would happen again, with no questions asked. In this battle Khalid had pledged to make the river run with blood, so those thousands of men, instead of being killed in the pursuit, were brought to the river and killed. And that is all that there is to the episode of the River of Blood....

Not when it's filled. Some were.


Since May 2004, Coalition forces (CF) have recovered at least 501 pre-1991 Gulf War Iraqi chemical weapons - including 448 122mm al Borak rocket warheads, **many of which contain the nerve agent sarin** (GB). 

From May 2004 until March 2009, Coalition forces recovered 4573 **filled** and unfilled pre-1991 Gulf War Iraqi chemical munitions. The recovered munitions consisted of bombs, artillery projectiles, and rockets designed to be filled with sulfur mustard, sarin, or binary sarin

-

(U) The expected potential hazard effects areas resulting from attacks utilizing pre-Gulf War Iraqi chemical weapons depends primarily on the type and number of munitions, percent fill, and agent purity

(U) NGIC has conducted detailed consequence asessments on several scnarios involving the use of pre-Gulf War Iraqi chemical weapons (see table below). These munitions are assumed to function as intended - explosively driven, cylindrical-dissemination devices. Source-term modeling was performed... to determine the performance of the improves device...

 "[/u/yummyluckycharms](https://nu.reddit.com/user/yummyluckycharms) **Thats true for any weapon - even unexploded bombs from ww1. The difference is these couldnt be used for anythign and we're just being stored.**"

Wrong.

In 2010, a clamming boat pulled up some old artillery shells of World War I from the Atlantic Ocean south of Long Island, New York. Multiple fishermen suffered from skin blistering and respiratory irritation severe enough to require their hospitalization.



-
  "[/u/yummyluckycharms](https://nu.reddit.com/user/yummyluckycharms) **Furthermore, much of the ammo rounds that they found were so old, they dated back to the Iran/Iraq war and couldnt be used**"

-

 "[/u/yummyluckycharms](https://nu.reddit.com/user/yummyluckycharms) **The difference is these couldnt be used for anythign and we're just being stored**"

There were mustard gas and binary sarin which have a long shelf life.
