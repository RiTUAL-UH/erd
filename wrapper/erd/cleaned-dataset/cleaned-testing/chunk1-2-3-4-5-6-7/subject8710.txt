 well i had done it and i was looking for it and i found it kind of funny that they have optimized missions so much like the prelude of darkness mission and set ups for css and kyuubi naruto. and the optimizations for characters like fixing shigure and ten ten while keeping the initial idea for how they play 




 So im a fairly old player (started when the site started lost that account so tech around 2009ish) and i remember doing a certain mission a long time ago where you had to use every character to finish and it was just set up for sannin missions. and i wanted to know what it was and if anyone remembers what the requirements entailed ex. what chararcters were used naruto 10/10  




 I made a league video and i enjoyed playing creating and editing the video. So i have uploaded it to youtube i want to know what spots i can possibly improve on and such and i don't want to fall under a specific formula. anyway this is my video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P_jFc_XGaA 




 this reminds me of when i played banjo kazooie im not going to make a post about since i would feel like im ripping off your idea for this but maybe ill just make a video about it but really thanks for sharing this story reminds me of the days as a kid growing up with the better systems hope you can find some nostalgia again some day its the greatest feeling in the world to relive your past  





























 well both are amazing in their own respects however your going to end up being forced to read the manga. not that its bad i love the manga 









 of all the champions in league i only have four left and seeing as i don't care to extremly about which ones i get i thought i would ask here for who i should buy my options are
Varus
Zyra
Galio
Kogma
if you can describe a champion well enough to where its almost like what choice to i have to buy them then ill probably instantly buy them instead of waiting for tahm kench (seeing as i buy the bundles anyway) 
























 i would atleast like some feedback if that isnt to much to ask 









 Master yi : "i sold my jungle item so i could deal more damage who needs that when im going to gank anyway" 




 i think aoki and kimura are going to improve with ippo this time around. Ippo lost and after his last loss he made the dempsy roll, but im thinking this time around ippo will be improving himself by helping aokimura out. possibly creating the new dempsy in the process and making aoki learn a move that isnt the frog punch. kimura just kind of sits back in his matches which isnt bad but he doesnt seem to do anything until the last rounds. were also still waiting on mike bison to find out how that goes if that match goes like the last matches we will see a mixture of hawk and eagle (which is basically just takamura) which would be takamuras biggest weakness. aokimura will see takamuras struggle possibly and realize that their idol could see a loss and want to improve with him. 
























 so with the arrival of new devourer i was wondering some new team comps. I believe that some of you would already have seen, although i am in bronze i feel i can talk about this. 
 Udyr, ezreal, nautilus, caitlyn, Gnar. 
so my reasoning for this is because you can have well poke and good CC at the same time. in a team fight you can easily single target people with either Udyr or Naut. on top of all that you could poke out the enemy team or zone out carries with ez cait and gnar(mini). this team i also feel would work situationally because you would have gnar for backline CC and multi target stuns and knockbacks for a good ez ult followed by multi knockup from naut. Devour would play a huge role here depending on udyr path whether it was tiger or phoenix. phoenix would be great aoe because you could multi flame, and tiger would be good for single target kills on carries. 
so this post was for my idea for some good team comps i wouldnt mind seeing some more be posted whether they are viable or not. 




 well im glad that im noticed in that regard but as you can tell the game was a loss i have alot of improving to do before i can even consider my self good. 




 thank you i love how you put chess in there it really puts it more in perspective for me with that analogy. i will be sure to take all of this information to heart thank you so much. 





























 im suprised that hasnt been used yet for vi. she has been around for atleast 2 Chinese new years.  




 as a current aatrox main i dont feel there is much that needs to be changed on him so hopefully what i say doesnt get downvoted because its not a significant change. 

1. passive - Aatrox passive could possibly give him bonus attack speed for using up all of his bloodwell given it normally gives him attack speed they could make it so that it decays percentage of actual attackspeed.
2. Q - aatrox Q is a really good engage/disengage however when ever your playing aatrox if you have your passive W up you can get an extremly good poke off just by jumping in and autoing and backing off with no real exchange. this isn't terrible but to fix this i believe that while airborn aatrox shouldn't be able to use his W to switch and make it so that the enemy atleast is given a chance before he flies like a majestic eagle.
3. W - not much to say about this except that if you have passive healing on that it should take away from your blood well as to make sure you are keeping your blood well high. (could even make the blood well heal you based on how full it is)
4. E - this skill is easy to hit and deals a good amount of damage nothing i would change on this because you still use your health to use it.
5. R - this skill is called massacre for a reason and i love the recent change with blood well being filled for what is hit around him however i wouldn't mind if when you activate it will instead of initially increasing his Attack Speed that it would increase based on how many people are around Aatrox 

alright hopefully this doesn't sound unbalanced in anyway but i also feel his kit is nice as a brawler. 




 i just recently started playing more ADC and i find this hillarious. Mainly because of the fact that i have felt like this when i got behind because i had not fully understood the role yet. 




 I was just talking about this with someone i helped get into league and personally alot of the unfriendlyness can come from not understanding the game. recently the meta has changed alot in favor of tanks and may be changing again soon, for someone new this wouldn't be a problem however they might fear the change in the game that might make their favorite champion not viable. obviously when you first start playing your not going to play against smurfs every game but smurfs can hurt a persons chances of wanting to play. 
























 Starks

1. yorick
2. karthus
3. sion
4. zyra
5. zac
6. aatrox
7. kogmaw

all i can think of at the moment i like the idea  




 would love to see warring kingdom jarvan. 




 the carry, the Carries carry 
i actually like that i hope that isnt taken for you 2 but basically the carries carry is the support in how they carry 




 well if you can give me an idea of your mains and roles i might be able to help. however off the top of my head.

1. the sun/the moon, besides being cheesy it works in league for diana and leona.
2. the hunter/the hunted. rengar in general
i guess i can understand how much harder it would be since you want to make it cute and its not easy becasue most names might be taken but perhaps you can find inspiration through some of the champions in league or a book 
























 well if you can manage to somehow not die instantly you will want to heal cougar jump over an available wall and if you have flash up and they flash towards you get ready to pounce your way to another wall and either flash or pounce. other than that you need to understand how much damage your Q [cougar]is going to do before hand. 




 i might be able to help although i have the same problem with vi always get ahead eventually. however i have played a decent amount of yasuo and can atleast help you with the early phase if your interested just message me back im on the NA servers but i could possibly make a video to help you out if your not on NA 




 my daily ritual is to hop on to the client stare at the screen of solo queue and ask my self "do i really hate myself enough to put myself through this again" as i click the start search and get into champion select and lose another game that could've been won. 




 well during the game when did you use your E perhaps a bug happened that you managed to set up.
