 I dont always hit a women, but when I do I make sure I knock her to the floor no questions asked 




 Looks like a classy establishment y'all stayed at.. 




 I like how it says, "Our Goal, Totally Satisfied" because when I get my car towed that is the complete opposite of what I am.. 




 GOJO in the bottom right corner...they know whats really going on.. 




 I bet they all rode their fixies there, and then smoked cigarettes. 




 Its funny to me that this person decided to take a picture at this moment. 




 and what was nailed now?

 It's Arizona to start..
 









 God Bless New York City! 









 Thats how I look when Im standing next to my friends 














 well I appreciate you keeping me busy while I wait to do my rounds, but now I must go do them so I have to be on my way, but I am sure we will run into each other again on this here internet thing! 




 i wouldnt say people dont know what they want in life but it is more of a "how do i get there" problem, in my opinion 




 thats why you always gotta have your other shit to keep you sane, trust me if I just had this job, id kill myself bc overnights suck balls. But I know that this is just a paycheck for me and the real fun happens once I get off! its all a matter of tolerance 




 oh well yea man ride the college train as long as you can, no point in fucking up school for minimum wage anyway. Everyone says find a job you love and get paid for it, but thats kind of bullshit in my mind. Find a job to survive and do the things you love because you love them, even if it doesnt pay.. 




 living the dream my friend, getting paid to troll haha...you are my age, why cant you find work? 




 to kill time during my overnight shift..ah win!

 naw... 




 This will destroy you rocks faces off! EITS and Mogwai both get my blood pumping! Old Yndi Halda is good stuff too! 
























 Hahaha we meet again my good friend! 




 To that i would say we are not trying to go for that wow factor all the time as we would like to see our music be used for things such as movies, commercials, sports films..etc so we like to leave space in the music and without a singer we understand that there isnt always something there that will grab and hold the occasional post rock listener, but that is ok for us. The songs have their moments that grab you and thats all we want, the rest is up to you :) 




 Hahaha thanks, someone at the bar the other night made the same comment and I had to google it to see bc I couldnt remember..good call tho  




 We are putting it out there ourselves with the intent of it being used for film and/or commercial work so we would like to make the money that way and not by way of sales, so with that said we will not be selling it but making it available online for free download to anyone who asks..but with any luck the album should be done by then end of this year or the very beginning of next..it comes down to how quick i can mix it all hahaha..keep an ear out tho and facebook is how we keep everyone updated so check that periodically too :) thanks again tho and good ear on the semi circle comment! 




 Thanks soooo much brotha!! I appreciate that!! 




 They are live recordings ;) and nice call on the semi-circle...did u see the video? 




 Thanks soo much man! I really appreciate you taking a listen to the music and i am happy you enjoi it! Pass it along and if youd like the link to the online free download let me know and keep an ear out for the full length cd that should be coming out sometime before the new year :) facebook of course too blah blah blah

 I live in San Diego, Ca 



















 I totally understand the whole money thing...studios tend to take advantage of pple who are new to the recording game and to be honest you could have gotten the same sound prolly for free from some recording arts student who is looking for bands to track...i recorded some awesome bands while i was in school using that method and you would be surprised how much cooler pple are when there is no money involved! Im a 26yr old audio engineer with some good vision. Id love to mix your track if you have the ability to get the session file or at least the individual tracks. I do alot of mixing at my studio at home and would love to toy around with some different stuff if youre into it. Not looking to get paid, bt if the mix comes out well, id love to be able to use it on my audio resume...let me know what you are thinking and also with your vocals being out of key, that is a relatively easy fix for me with some of the programs i use...let me know..message me back on here and we can figure it all out! My name is alex btw 




 I have not no..but I will definitely check them out now! You a fan? 




 San Diego post rock. www.soundcloud.com/thievesoftheamericandream

 




 My post rock band just finished our first EP. Take a listen and let me know what you think! Thanks everyone and enjoy!

www.soundcloud.com/thievesoftheamericandream 




 hey man! glad that you got a recording done in a studio! Such a good feeling! its a good track, but it sounds like the guitars are really compressed hard, especially during the distortion parts..it sounds like it is just slammed and really sucks the life out of the guitar tracks...the vocals are also very very in front of the mix, which i guess is good in some instances but it could prolly be mixed back a bit because the singer tends to stress some of his vocals at times. other than that it sounds good and keep rocking! 
























 This is not wtf material... :( 




 beth? 




 That is an awesome painting! I want that for my album artwork for the band! 




 Keep doing your thing Nate! Looks great and can only get better from here! Interested at all in doing some album artwork!? 














 This is old news...
 



















 Ahhhhhhhh the cuddle fish, I'm sooo sawee Kyle! 




 Unfortunately tho bro..justin machado took that photo of me yesterday and i went out with him and 4 other close friends as his family is good family friends from high school bc he was my teacher...so i was with someone who knows what they are doing and was giving me great advice... the broken board was my own doing...ive grown up around surfing, seen it everyday in the water while i was on a sponge and have been in the water probably more in my life than on land... so i am not charging out on big waves not knowing what i am doing...i am riding waist high white wash trying to understand the feeling and mechanics of the board under my feet before taking it to an area full of surfers...being a sponger i know how surfers view someone who doesnt know what they are doing so i am not being irresponsible by just charging out like it is no thing...having lost people to the water, i understand it is not something to be taken lightly so please do not assume you know how I am approaching this because everything I do is always very calculated..

And stop using the word Kook, its unbecoming...  




 Hah oh yess know god speed for sure just never seen it written like that :)
 




 No need to buy we will send you a copy for free :) 




 No need to buy we will send you a copy for free :) 




 Yea it is all instrumental music! We want to leave it up to the listener to make what they want of it :) 




 Hahaha ur right bro. What was I thinking...And learning on white wash u are right, Im so in your way and complete nuisance. It's all good, i don't set foot in PB, so you can claim that for yourself..I'll take a break at wind n sea, table tops, boneyards, hell even beacons or any other break in NC over PB any day so that's all yours man..

If your worried about a "kook" stealing ur wave, don't trip. I have lived here my whole life and have been in the water for most of it just not surfing, so I know my etiquette. But I will say out of everyone I've talked to about this learning experience, you sir have been the biggest Richard of them all, so I say good day to you 




 If you think I'm a hipster with the pbr comment...you are way way off base my friend...i forgot tho that you came out of your moms vagina on a Steve Lis and never were a kook...I hope you never try something new again so you can always stay in top of your game bro..  




 Thanks brotha! I appreciate that! Take a look at the videos online and check facebook from time to time for when the album is going to come out! We are going to make it available for download for free to anyone who wants it :) thanks again man! 




 Its actually a handle bar mustache bt its hard to tell from the picture..freddie didnt have a handle bar mustache ... :/ 




 A female singer definitely would add something interesting to the music! Maybe some background harmony stuff during the heavy parts would be cool! Thanks for taking a listen, glad u like it :) 




 Thank you soo much :) it is very heart warming to have all this support..we really hope that once the album is done we can give it to enough people where it can just start to spread around to anyone who enjoys good music and we feel that with not having vocals we appeal to a more global audience while still maintaining a humbling sound :) glad you like it tho and I am always happy to talk music with anyone! Be on the look out for the new album coming soon, check the website periodically and facebook too :) thanks again! 




 I appreciate that. I am sure the other guys would feel the same way if they were here right now. We try to leave a lot up to the listener and allow them to really make what they want of it. The parts that grab you are intended to do exactly that and the rest is up to the listener :) be on the look out for the new album. Once its done I will put it online for free download to anyone who wants it. I will probably put a post on reddit for it :) 




 Hey thanks sooo much for taking a listen and glad u like! We actually take alot of our inspiration from the bands mogwai, russian circles, minus the bear, explosions in the sky, Sigur Ros, older Yndi Halda...a lot of post rock thats for sure but to be honest, I am unfamiliar with the band you mentioned but i am going to look them up as soon as I can! Thanks again, it means a lot! 




 Yea but i still get more pussy than you ;) 




 Yeeaaahhhh boooyyyyy 




 Ob logic! I was surfing at river mouth in del mar today when this shit happened! Ima need to find another board to get on...my friend is planning a trip to south america next june so i said i would learn to surf for when we went so I gotta do this haha 




 U should play clue bc u nailed it bro 




 haderp! 




 Thanks you sooo much! It is awesome to hear someone say that! We really put in the effort to make our music an experience! Im glad you appreciate the different song feels we put out there for you to listen to! We are trying to do everything that you just conveyed in your last comment so thank you :)  
























 God damnit.. 




 Wow..yes, yes you did.
 




 Idk what in-n-out you went to but there is always at least a 15min wait for food because it is so packed..in any of them..the fries are not too great I will give you that, but the burgers are phenomenal! Not to mention not nearly as pricey as five guys either..meat and cheese baby, meat and cheese :) but I enjoy five guys as well. 









 wait til you try in-n-out burgers..only if you come to the west side of the states tho.. 




 bahahaha 









 What is your best pickup line and did it work? 





























 Wait, yea, just checked this guy out....this is total bullshit..he's been posting stuff for the last couple months about work and his "place"...I smell a Karma whore 




 Hope you have a job.. 




 I would sure hope after only 10 years you could..otherwise you would be a sparkling example of the divorce statistic in this country 
























 So basically you are telling everyone that you have it too... 




 Original, like ur style.. 









 looks like you have a real winner there. I feel a karma whore coming on, right about now.. 









 if you like post rock music, then take a listen to our new song [Surface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqRimKa322I) 




 Take a listen to a post rock instrumental band from San Diego called [Thieves of the American Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqRimKa322I) they are very powerful and cinematic, much like Sigur Ros..hope this helps :) 




 Giant panda, Soul position, DJ Alibi, Ugly Duckling, Aesop Rock, Deltron 3030, Hieroglyphics, Souls of Mischief, Kool Keith, Atmosphere, Brother Ali, Eyedea and Abilities, Felt, Living Legends, MC Paul Barman 




 there is a post rock band called Thieves of the American Dream who do all instrumental music..very cinematic pieces, its been used in documentaries and commercials.. [thieves of the american dream](http://www.reverbnation.com/thievesoftheamericandream) 




 Atmosphere, MC Paul Barmen, Giant Panda, DJ Alibi 




 damn...rip eyedea 









 When you say wooshy, in what regard? Are you referring to the overheads of the drums or the guitars? 




 Very cool man! Well if you very get stuck on a mix for a band, let me know I'd love to help out where I can. Keep up the good work and advice! 




 Ok I appreciate that! I am opening up my DAW as we speak! 




 Do you do any work with bands or is it mainly production stuff? 




 Very cool man! What r unrunning in your studio if you don't mind me ask 




 Definitely do! Sounds like you know what you want to do with it! Keep up the good work! 




 Oh heck ya man, i have been reading through the past threads and I appreciate you giving quality advice and feedback to people. It's important for people to pass along the knowledge! 




 Thank you, ya sometimes it is hard to find that balance. With this genre of music there tends to be a lot of repetitiousness and so we try not to do too much of it because without lyrics it can start to get monotonous. Thank you for the feed back tho! Take a listen to our newest song, it is our Frankenstein song with some post rock, math rock and post hardcore influence [Caterpillar Harvest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BIdyxmSiV0) 




 I hear ya, I often hear tracks getting too muddy because of side chains on everything at certain points to make changes more prominent and that bugs the hell out of me. The track sounds great tho man! Crisp and clear  




 The structure of the song is good and the lyrical content is there, but as at as the mix goes there are a couple things that could be done. I am glad to see you are a fellow logic user tho :) the vocals sound like they could be compressed a little more, just to smooth them out and sit them in the mix a little nicer. The snare also seems to have a bit of a long tail on the reverb when it is hit, or it could be the natural decay of the snare, but either way tightening up a gate a little on it might make it sound a little less muddy..but then again sometimes that's nice to have. 




 I appreciate that! Did you listen to it in headphones by chance...the stereo image of this song is actually quite big :) now I need to zone out and listen to it again and again haha 




 Hahaha rad man! I am a rock musician too bt do hip hop stuff on the side so I appreciate where you are coming from and putting this out there! You sound a bit like [MC Paul Barman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC_Paul_Barman) and [Atmosphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_(music_group) the lyrics are good with a good sense of timing about them. Te beat is pretty good too just needs to have the drums drop in a little harder! I'd love to put some drums to this track! Nicely done, hope to hear more! 




 This track sounds real good! The drops are solid and the build ups are nice and fluid..I get a little bit of some weird phantom frequencies around the 2-3k range but I am also listening with Grado's and they hear everything too well haha... Maybe try side chaining an low end oscillator to your kick on the drops to give it a little more DROP.. The track is awesome tho man, quite the listening experience! 




 I like the track very different sounding..the only thing I would say is with the way that the vocals are mixed, very light and airy with tons of reverb, I almost wanted to hear some solid drums in the track, at least something at would drop at some point, just to give the track some continuity...nothing to crazy but a simple electronic beat or a minimal DnB beat would suffice, just because it feels as tho that would keep the interest of the listener a little more, but that's just IMHO. Keep up the good work! 




 Just listened to the song and I really like the guitar work..it is busy bt not overwhelming which is what I like... I think if you were to find the right drummer for it to keep it busy and interesting bt at the same time able to come back to a solid rhythm, I think the song could have a real math/indie rock feel to it...I am a drummer and would love to record something to it for fun! I will definitely be jamming to it later either way! 




 [Surface](http://www.reverbnation.com/thievesoftheamericandream/song/17276298-surface)


Hello fellow music makers! I am pretty much finished with a mix I did for my post rock instrumental band. The song is called Surface. Take a listen and any feedback and/or criticism is always welcome and encouraged! Hope you enjoy! (If you have headphones, I'd put them on now)

 Hey man! Just listened to the song and it has a nice feel when it first comes into the verse bt then it starts to get a little repetitious..maybe break it up with some sort of change in the song..an effect or chorus or something because the verse feels a bit too long :)  




 The EP sounds great man, there is a lot of room in there for some samples that might be a nice compliment to the song.. Very good sounding and the vocalist has good dynamic! Sounds like a good project to be a part of! Good luck! 



















 I didnt even see the dude on the floor till he started spazing out hahaha 


































 ahhh, now the context is all making sense! It is way too early for all this.

 You own the mineral rights to those 20 acres and can build non permanent structures on it with a non concrete foundation and so long as you can tear it down with no evidence that it was ever there, you can build whatever u want...for the most part...

 Well, in spirit ;) 




 Already ran into him.. 









 You are correct..we are hoping it is signs of a pocket near by..exposing bedrock with lots of virgin gravels on top..looks good so far :) 




 Maybe $25... 









 no music up anywhere yet tho :( 




 so if you look at the maker of the toy set, it is the same name as who apparently left the ransom note for the family...oh man, gotta love photoshop! 




 as a drummer who has played many shows in the past, DO NOT PLAY YOUR HARDEST SONG first.... that is horrible advice! Play the song that you and your band feel will keep people's attention and make them wanting more, that way you can get the audience into your music and band and if you fuck up down the line, chances are no one will notice. As opposed to playing your hardest song first (which to the average listener, they wont be able to tell) and possibly fucking it up and having that be the thing people remember because it was your first song. 

In the end, put together a set that will keep people interested, and that doesnt necessarily mean playing your hardest song first.

Bring lots of sticks and keep a rag near by for those sweaty palms because with it being your first gig, no matter how calm and collected you are, you gunna get the nervous sweats

Make friends with the front of house engineer too, he ultimately holds the fate of your band for that club in his hands....saying hello and offering to help with any kind of stage set up really does go a long way.

bring lots of sticks and dont drink too much before the stage, being drunk at your own gig is over played

AND REMEMBER, have as much fucking fun as possible and keep telling yourself this is why we all got into gigging in the first place! 

Good luck brotha! Whats the name of your band?

 Only on reddit will a gif like this turn into an English argument.. But I learned something today 




 The comments were at 666, so I had to change that  




 And this is how it starts 




 Cats are fucking stupid 









 The dog.. 




 It's my town of Truckee, Ca.. Lake Tahoe area  



















 Just don't drink and drive. It's simple. And anyone who says it's not that easy is making excuses for themselves  




 Yes, yes I do 




 Oh man, hotline Miami.. Great game  









 So first of faggot, he has been going to that lady for over 35 years.. Secondly, if barbershops weren't full of pretentious douche bags like yourself, maybe I would have considered it. 




 The shock of having a gay grandson too much for him?

 My grandfather has been getting his hair cut from the same lady for over 35yrs which is why we went there :)

 Fuck cats 





























 Regular musician here, see back room castings.. 




 Burning man is not that great unless ur a huge hippy.. Otherwise it's a dirty dusty place with tons of fucked up pple in a relatively small space thinking they are more artsy than the next person... In the end, the burning man event does more damage to the surrounding land than anything else despite everyone being "Eco" friendly.. 














 Absolutely gorgeous, I keep going back to your pics.. :) 














 Getting some friends together tmrw and buying some cards to send off!! 




 Lucky workout equip! 




 Do it! If nothing else it's fun to get out there and at least look.. Equipment can be expensive however, and we work somewhere where we are able to get a lot of scrap metal and other pieces and make a lot of what we have ourselves..bt we have a high banker, single level sluice box, tons of hoses to gravity feed water, lots of buckets and wash bins, classifiers shovels and rock picks 




 The paper process is quite involved and there are a few ways of going about it. You can stake a claim on lands that the BLM have allowed for mineral harvesting. But you would need to check with the  LR2000 to make sure it's not already claimed and that is a whole process in itself! Talk to your county's mineralogist  and possibly visit the BLM offices, they will help you as much as they can..at least they did for us here in CA... 

You can also buy claims from people who are selling then but they tend to be a little more expensive but at least that way you are paying for the paperwork being done and just a transfer in title is all that is needed at that point and then putting up the proper signs on your claim..
