 I go to college in PA, I live in Maryland when I'm not at school, and I plan to get involved in the campaign in PA and try to get others involved on my campus. 


































 Bernie a few days ago on NPR (these quotes are taken from an article written on The Hill):

 Talking about cultural divides in this country, you know, it is important for people in urban America to understand that families go out together and kids go out with their parents and they hunt and they enjoy the outdoors and that is a lifestyle that should not be condemned...if anyone thinks that gun control itself is going to solve the problem of violence in this country, you're terribly mistaken...so, obviously, we need strong, sensible gun control and I will support it. But some people think it's going to solve all of our problems. It is not."

Here is the article I am referring to:

 I figured this would be good to post to this thread. It is a video about marketing and what Apple does that makes them so successful. I am part of a fraternity and we use this method when recruiting, it is very helpful and I hope you all watch it if you have not already.

 The mask was in the passenger seat of the car driving Casper. 




 I remember in season one Marty had the horns above his head in the poster, and I looked back on the promotional posters from season 2 and found this.

The crow in the middle of the road has to be a reference to the Birdman, right?

Edit 1: By Birdman I mean the bird mask that has been shown/worn in both episodes of season 2. 
























 the world may never know then. 




 yeah I'm not a bot, just a bored college student. 





























 why was he not searched before they took him out? Is it against his rights (I'm not lawyer or a cop)? 




 There was a post like this earlier today, Donna Edwards is running in Maryland, she is a progressive. There is someone else, might want to look back and see if the post is still there.

 I am probably going to buy a few things from the store in the next few days, probably a shirt and few buttons, I was curious about shipping times? I have seen that people on here having been posting that it has taken 4+ weeks and I go back to college in a little over a month and was curious if it was still taking that long so I could know where to ship my order to (my college address or home address)
