 Feelin good on a Wednesday!  









 I posted the original 4 months ago, but here we are side by side.  














 Check us out http://facebook.com/fullertonpike 

People request to use our stuff all the time! Feel free to check it out! 




 Its a good lesson for all our boys. Take it in stride and be humble...that's the attitude that got us our Smythe! 




 They hate us because we are a top house at our school. It's pretty funny. 




 We got a lot of positive feedback, even from our rival chapter! We still get the hate but, hell, with enough Yaks you might see a second video. 




 The reaction has been incredibly positive by all sorority women as well as our rival fraternity on campus! It's a good idea, just make sure it's executed well!   



















 Definitely a Blow Job shot...unless they're into that sort of thing. 




 No more farts! 














 A lesbian Steve Jobs  





























 Find the rest of the trash can and then write about your experience. You can call it National Treasure 4 




 It's my honest belief that everyone is in some way, shape, or form a secret freak that needs a little bit of Jesus in their life. 




 Kill Bill! I've seen it maybe 20-30 times now.  









 When you're so excited about the movie and you watch it with your friends, but they have the most disinterested look on their faces.  




 Wow, I just read that comment too! 

I know everyone has a different situation, but I just came out to 160 of my fraternity brothers and was called, texted, and messaged from so many of them saying that they were proud of me and that they loved me!

The only advice I have for someone in the closet is to come out when you're ready, but don't take forever!

 




 Well, at least your Mom didn't use your laptop one day only to find that you didn't catch that hidden gay porn pop-up window that pushes itself to the back of all of your open windows.

That was a fun conversation. 

 




 Coming out of the closet.  




 Pizza is the circle of life.  




 We're into old ladies. 




 I've never seen Goonies and now I'm too afraid to even ask to watch it. 









 It actually bums me out that people are taking this negatively. Sheesh man she's just trying to support us, not drag us out of the closets.  




 Does anyone know who this man is of when this was taken? He looks like a regular that comes into my restaurant!  




 The perfect bathroom for...some people. 




 TIL that people on reddit have bad teeth. 




 I just wanna pick your cheeks 




 "Thank you officer, I feel refreshed." 




 Pizza...pizza dat ass. ;) 









 No Diggity - Chet Faker 
























 "I feel okay about feeding my child McDonald's now, because books!" 




 This is so terrible, I'm tearing up.  




 I don't know how to do any of that 




 I lived with an Asian family the first semester that I transferred to my university. It was weird, so I decided to join a club so I could branch out and meet new people. Turns out that after the first semester, one of my club-mates asked me to move into his 5 bedroom house. Life was good after that.

Then I joined a fraternity and made like a million more friends. 




 My open palm. 




 I'm from Southern California and confused about all that white stuff on the ground behind you. 









 These are so annoying 




 I want to eat it. It looks like delicious marzipan candy. 









 I would sign a blood contract and pledge to you my first born.  




 Your parents are related. 









 You really couldn't walk a flight of stairs to go pee? You are so lazy! 




 Kill Bill: Instead of a story of revenge, it a really sadistic story about a man stalking his ex lover, killing all of her friends and family in order to find her and kill her.

Sounds more like a horror film than a kung-fu movie. 




 Its NYE and everyone in the office is pretending to work. 




 I fell in love and out of love and that gap in between is what I remember the most.  




 Whatever movie that made Nicholas Cage famous. 




 When you're pooping in a stall next to somebody.  




 Your taste in music.  




 Her

I was in awe once the film ended and all of my friends hated it. They literally laughed the entire car ride home about how stupid it was, which almost ruined it for me.  
























 What else are you supposed to do when another man looks longingly into your eyes from a kissings distance?  




 Not sure if anyone explained, but this is copied and pasted from an article:

The important thing to note is that theyre not suing Fox under US Law (because it would probably go nowhere and theyve probably been informed of this by the French Ambassador in Washington).

The lawsuit is most likely in French Court (which has a lower standard of proof for libel cases than US courts, and less restrained by Free Speech statutes like courts in the US are) and I also wouldnt be surprised if a similar suit had been, or will be filed in European (EU) court (Which is actually more serious and a bigger deal because that ruling wouldnt just be binding to France but to EU member states).

More than likely Foxs ability report and operate (effectively) in France is what would be effected, with broader implications in the rest of Europe which is why they were so quick to come out with that apology last weekwhich you never EVER see them do in the US even when theyve been proven patently wrong in their reporting by THEIR OWN news reporting, sometimes.

Britain and Birmingham was probably never going to suedespite Rupert Murdochs shaky relationship with the government there over the phone hacking scandal, due to similar high standards for libel suits (which is why the tabloids there put the US Tabloids to shame), and also because Murdoch has a lot of connections (read: business interests) there, but the situation is vastly different in France.

 Oh god, anything with cheese.  




 I occasionally hang out with my good friend Pamela Handerson 




 Go to Vegas tomorrow. Play roulette and put it all on black.  




 If a group of people collectively chooses not to hang out with you, that should be a major red flag about how you interact with them. 




 Black Mirror! It's so good that sometime's its hard to watch. 




 Learning how to read poetry. I never understood how to follow along with the abstract line breaks until my teacher told us to follow the punctuation. 




 I was walking down a couple of steps leading into my garage while carrying two large jugs of wine (one in each hand) and I slipped and fell down the steps. One of the jugs hit the ground and shattered.

 




 Please don't ever workout in the sauna. I saw a man once doing a stretch workout in a SPEEDO while in the sauna. I saw more of him than I cared to. 




 What next? A kamikaze hooveround?  




 Kill La Kill is on Netflix. Very similar you should watch if you haven't 




 "Fleek" it means "on point"

#ShoesOnFleek
#HairOnFleek
 




 No boobs, but instead a penis. 




 Picking their noses while driving. I've seen you, you've seen me. 




 I do this too, but mostly on my forehead so I can breathe. 




 When i was a kid, i used to sleep with my knees up and one leg crossed over the other. It kind of looks like I'm sitting but laying down at the same time.  




 Chet Faker - Built on Glass

He looks like a yeti, but has the voice of an angel. 




 The Red Wedding in Game of Thrones. I never read the books, so when it happened I felt the world crumbling around me. 

 




 Weatherby 
























 This is a great way to get more shell in my eggs.  




 The 10 people who still use myspace also reported outages.  









 If KFC managed to invent a wrap-able chicken-thing. Then I'm sure they could come up with a better slogan. 




 Going to buy this for my SO, without the hot dog. I've got my wiener that would fit quite nicely in between that oddly curved piece of chicken.  









 I'm bi sexual and every time I heard those words from my parents I pretty much expected the, "we know you're gay" conversation.


Actually, I still do considering I haven't come out to them yet. 














 Some dead whore is not your excuse to be a terribler person.  




 This is so stupid. The only place a slice of pizza should go is directly into my mouth. 









 It was part of The Chainsmokers newest radio show. Fell in love with it.  









 When i was a kid, i was so excited to go swimming until i saw my reflection in the water. I was fat and it was the first time I ever realized it.  




 That's a prime double chin-shot. I'm not sure what's not to like about that. 




 I can't unsee the illusion  




 Before and After: Day 1 




 This grandma knows how to party 









 This isn't the Bodies exhibit, you twat. 
























 It feels silly.  




 I don't get why anyone uses it. It's like me greeting a fellow gay by saying "what up my fag?"  









 Kill Bill 




 Image taken via potato  




 I remember coming home and making a big deal about watching Total Request Live on MTV. Life was so simple back then. 




 His first passive-aggressive roomate note  




 The first thing that comes to mind is people in developing countries. I believe that famine would be quick to wipe them out once over-population runs its course. 




 Why do I want to eat all of the things on that list? 




 Thanks for the Dad joke! Now all I need to find a baby to yell this to! 














 He's an Olympic athlete and also the guy who married into the Kardashian family. 









 If there's nobody else in line I make sure to walk away fr the register when they walk up. 




 SETH GREEN? 




 I saw like 900 of these pictures on snapchat and instagram today!  




 Cheat on her! That'll make it loud an clear. 




 When it smells like gloves. 









 I wonder if you could you recreate your kids face using his DNA to find out what he will look like when he's older.



 





























 George Clooney is hosting a rave? I'm in.  




 Written and directed by one of my co-workers. This kid has talent and he's only 17.  




 This is awesome. His parents are awesome. Don't let the world steal away his light like what has happened to so many of us! 









 That's a really great white and gold sweater 




 Being educated and intelligent is not the same thing. Most people who even have that like on their profiles are complete bores.  




 I get a huge Aluna George vibe from this group, which I absolutely love.  









 I like guys.... ;) 




 I'm sorry I got excited. I haven't been matched with anyone in like weeks. Do you know what that can do to a man? 




 Apparently /u/Quixoitc88 is the king of this subreddit and Tinder, maybe the world? Who knows. 




 "Usually the guy is tall enough for the girl to wear heels"

Idk man, that right there made me think you needed to be reminded!  




 In this case no, you do know people's heights vary from person to person right? 




 Is that why I've only been seeing and getting matched with men? Damnit! 




 Maybe. In my defense she's wearing heels haha. 














 iAm so tired of the iPhone type naming scheme.  




 Instructor: "Hell, no. I did *not* leave the South Side for this!" 




 Of course he's not a Kanye fan, he looks like he's more into Rock   Roll.
