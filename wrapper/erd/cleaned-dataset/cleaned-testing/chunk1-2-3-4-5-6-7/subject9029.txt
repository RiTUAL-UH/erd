 Hey! I was there on Friday :) 





























 Awww! :) that's very nice! 




 Part of the strawberry loop in Tiburon. :)

 






















































 Ahhh, I see. Thanks!  




 I tried looking this place up, but I only saw a short 4 mile loop. Is that what you're doing? Or is there more there. I ask because I live in Sacramento and am always looking for trails to ride :)  I've done American River, Sacramento River, Santa Rosa area, a lot in SF, and in Davis.
