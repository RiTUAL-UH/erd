To name the worst...
Ebola
Rabies

 This is fucking brilliant. 



























































 I'm pretty sure they're intended to be placeholder names. Once we know more about what they are and how they work we'll probably have other names for them but for now their 'true forms' are hidden from us so we call them dark.

You can view hotels by rating of their "high speed" wifi. 




 I bet she has "LOVE YOU" written on her eyelids. 




 Different countries use different decimal markers. 






















































 Thats pretty cool sitting in the box like that, but that dudes back is gotta be wrecked now. 














 Make your dream bigger, and the steps to get there smaller. 




 This is the same type of crap that gets us movies like Lucy.
We only use 10% of our brains, 8.2% of our DNA, and so forth.
Frankly DNA is still a big mystery. Lots of stuff in it is hard to figure out.
I might only use 8.2% of my keyboard most of the time, but that ALT-F4 is REALLY damn important when I'm watching disturbing porn with someone else in the house. 









 Idiots, doing idiot things ! 




 Someday, when I'm a dad, I'll really hate people like you because I'll be way to lazy to put that much effort into things. 


















































































































 Just hope that photoshop they were talking about doesn't pop up.
 



























































 You should modify your handling.dat file and then chase after them.... 




 Except for the adopted the daughter's butt!!!!!

 Basically this (though I prefer ghee over cheese), but careful with too much seafood.
Heavy metal toxicity is a serious problem. 




 What's up, dog?

If someone was recording my voice, you would've heard an "OH my god no" followed by a large inhale going "ahhhhhhhhhhh"

 Man... In Canada (atleast in Calgary) you're obligated to shovel the side walk by your house even if it's covered in 5 feet of cold ass snow. Instead of chilling with cocoa my dad and I would be busting our asses clearing that. 




 You forgot the coca extract for the Aztec chocolate. And the ritual part where the priest rips your beating heart out of your chest 
















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































 Judges generally don't earn that much. And the $2.2m was undoubtedly spread among many judges. I think it's a combination of fear, greed and disbelief that they would ever be caught.

It's funny how they underestimate Americans' ability to detect bullshit in the digital age. 




 The 47-year-old left with 15 gigabytes worth of data and information regarding human experimentation, which he felt may have crossed ethical boundaries

 Peer-reviewed paper published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.
 




 Yeah, it always amazes me how so many people who fall over themselves to criticize people like Thomas Jefferson, Mother Theresa, Henry Ford and so on for their faults often seem to regard Steve Jobs as a saint.
He was one of the highest profile dicks of the 20th century. He just happened to make good phones. At least, if you like screens the size of postage stamps.
