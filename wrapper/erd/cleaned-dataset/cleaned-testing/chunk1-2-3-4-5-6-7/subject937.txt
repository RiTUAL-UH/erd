 Accountants know which businesses are thriving and managed the best: which painter, roofer, plumber, electrician, dentist, etc. 














 Dear [test_subject937],

Thank you for contacting me about net neutrality.

I oppose any form of censorship or discrimination. I believe those who pay for our web capacity must be able to recover their costs, or it won't get built.

Supporters of net neutrality argue that giving all internet users the highest speed and greatest volume of space available - whether or not they contribute to the cost of building that capacity - is the only way to guarantee that no one will be discriminated against on the basis of what they want to say. However, there is very little incentive for carriers to build infrastructure if they have no way to recoup their costs. Without such an incentive, many new high bandwith applications, such as medical technology and communications for emergency personnel, many not be feasible.

Simply put, I believe providers shouldn't be able to block access to any other providers on the basis of content, and access to the capacity that has been built by the public should be open to the public on equal terms. But, access to future capacity should be open on equal terms to those who share the cost of its construction.

Thanks again for caring enough to get involved, and please don't hesitate to contact me again in the future.

Sincerely,

John Barrow

 I couldn't find anything about it (and hope this sub is appropriate). Does anyone have any idea?

Will voice calls via Hangouts have to use a Google Voice number or will it use the phone's? 




 It's been posted on their Facebook page.

Thanks for all the great memories! 










































































 I'm hearing that the water tower by the ANGC busted due to the earthquake. It was leaking before then - big time. We saw water cascading out about 15 minutes before the quake. 









 And which is worse? 
























 Apart from PDF Mergy, I haven't been able to find many apps that allow manipulation of PDFs. I'd really like to be able to split a PDF into two, rotate a page, and perform OCR.

Any suggestions? 














 I just received an email allegedly from Google (no-reply@accounts.google.com) stating that someone attempted to sign into me Google Account. The email has the standard blue button link to reset my password.

I was initially suspicious so I did a quick search and it seems bogus. Can anyone here confirm that it is not legitimate? I reported the email as a phishing attempt.

Thanks! 









 Is anyone else having this problem? My Nexus 7 (2013) randomly reboots at least once a day, but usually more. It's annoying and since I use it for work, it often happens at critical moments.

Also, I have Google Maps on the home row and it is removed every time it reboots. All the other slots are folders so I'm not sure if that's the cause or if it is something specific to Google Maps. 









 An earlier thread had a discussion about how we used to count by suns/daytime and nights. It makes more sense for a "day" to begin at roughly sunrise. Was this standardized by the same folks who standardized the calendar? 



















 [Google Calendar Auto-fill](http://i.imgur.com/p6BYAd4)

 We drove about 450 miles both ways. Using Maps, we were able to anticipate delays and find routes around them.

All told, we dodged 4 massive jams. It's hard to know how much time we saved but we figure at least an hour, maybe two. 




 For one, it assumes household finances are analogous to government finances. And it tells us _nothing_ important (because it's a low bar we all meet - to be a functioning adult is to balance a checkbook).

Is there a way that it is/can be used that is not a cop out? In my experience, it is usually said by someone who doesn't want to be tied to the social platform of the Republican party, but more so doesn't want to be thought of as a liberal or a Democrat.

I've thought this for years and am genuinely curious that I am missing something. 












































 I'd like to be able to give my boyfriend access to my reminders (and vice versa). When we are running low on, say, toilet paper, either one of us can say: "Remind me and [boyfriend] to buy toilet paper at Kroger."

When either one of us goes to Kroger... ding!

It seems like it would be easy for Google to do, and I'm sure there are other ways it could be used. Thoughts, /r/Android? 



















 Both cheeks when the shadow covers the entire lane; left or right when it only covers the left or right portion.

I'm 31 and still love doing it. I tell myself it's why I have a bedonk. 














 I have very little knowledge of the net's infrastructure so forgive me if it's a dumb question. It just seems to me that the very nature of the internet makes it impossible to truly be anonymous. 



































































































 I apologize if this has been asked and answered. I searched this sub and Google but couldn't find an answer.

The sound works fine for seemingly everything else.

Thanks in advance, r/applehelp! 





























 Augusta, GA here! My boyfriend and I are planning a NYC trip during Masters weekend this year (April 12th to 14th). Neither of us have been there before and we need some help finding a hotel. Any reasonably priced but decent suggestions?

Thanks in advance! 




 Bottom line is as it appears: what can be done here? My cousin is such a good person - but she has decided that his lack of belief in the Christian god is a deal breaker.

I'm asking for effective advice... he wants to be with her. He does not want her to "convert" to his "religion"; but she is demanding the same.

Is this fair? And what can be done (in good faith)? 




 Karma is no more/less valuable than video game points. And the frontpage seems very similar to a final boss.

Does reaching the front page reduce this tendency? Front page fame is not worthless; fame a second time is still something.

Is a game any less valuable?
 














 The good Senator is deleting all the comments because he isn't getting the response he thought he'd get.

It also appears he edited the original post (I have a screenshot).

Who's up for showing him how wrong he is? I bet we can post comments quicker than he can delete them! 









 What is the best way to verify the team of someone requesting membership on G+? I've seen people suggest requesting a screenshot of the comm with the invitee's name (and color) but I'm not convinced that is very reliable.

Thanks in advance! 









 What is Google's end game? What will a fully unified Google Account look like and how will it enhance your life?

Also, what are some product combinations you would like to see? 














 When the app loads and locks in on the player, does it zoom in on your exact location on the globe? It does for me (and I assume Google wouldn't choose my small-ish city as a default, hence the possible dumbness). 









 We were trying to destroy resonators by a museum around midnight. They saw my parked car and got out to investigate. At this point, I don't think they knew we were there. 

We approached them and they asked what we were up to. We showed them the phone and explained that it is a global game of capture the flag created by Google. That simple explanation dropped the tension level down dramatically (they didn't know what they were walking into until then). 

They laughed and checked it out a bit. Told us not to get "attacked" ourselves, and went on their way. 

Overall, it was a good experience. We told them that they might start seeing more people like us and it's just a game.  




 From the letter posted on the investigation board:

SWEKU 
XKCWDJHOYELFMSBZUQI 
ARSMZEPIWOUK

Does anyone know what it means? It doesn't seem like a alphabetical substitution cipher... 




 Where's the big surprise? Does anyone know if anything actually happened tonight? 









 Call it an embarrassment of riches but I am getting email notifications constantly (I pretty much own every portal in the area and you get one for every resonator destroyed). 

Can we turn these GD notifications off? I suppose I can create a filter but that's just a work-around. 









 Check out the history map for a good overview of your work!

I've been active for about 7 days and... WOW! I've covered my area quite nicely.

(I'd post my map but it's all buggy this morning for some reason.) 




 Can anyone confirm (from an official source) that we are currently in beta?

And if so, what will be the major changes between beta and the official release? Obviously there will probably be no invitation process. What about items? Will they rain down from heaven like they do now (when turning in codes)?

I'd like to see this turn into a general "how the official release will differ from beta" thread if possible. 




 I have trouble pronouncing "pronunciation". Not because I wasn't exposed to or didn't know the correct pronunciation, but because a friend of mine hilariously mispronounced it one day while trying to defend his failure to properly pronounce another word (resulting in an ongoing joke that is over 10 years old). 

Now I legitimately get the the two versions confused and have to pause and mentally say it before verbally saying it. 



















 For me, it's the definition of despotism. The Civilization series introduced me to that word and it seems like a term that most people should know.

But I distinctly remember one of my best friends in college needing a definition from me when I used the term to describe Saddam Hussein's regime.

She is very intelligent and well-educated, which only made it that much more perplexing to me.

So, Reddit, what other examples are there? 







































 Well I don't disagree. But will South Africa have a food shortage without China? 




 Nah - I'm a liberal Dem. Just passing the info along. (Plus I'll be out of town.) 




 I agree (work in the legal field). Perjury is for some reason not taken that seriously.

As testimony is often the only available evidence, perjury _should_ be a primary concern of the judicial system. 




  If it's economic pressure, you can't really blame the SA government.

Every decision has various pressures. How far are you willing to take this?

 









 My personal experience definitely confirms this. I wore it from 7:45 am until 8:45 pm yesterday and it had ~30% left.

I responded to texts, used navigation, controlled music in the car, received various notifications throughout the day, and checked the time several times. I would consider my usage moderate to heavy.

This is a dramatic increase from the battery before the update. I was going to return the damn thing and now I don't think I will. 




 Get a flu shot regardless of your age. Protect your tiny and elderly loved ones! 




 Because they're not humans with our varied motivations. 




 Did my reply disappear? Weird. But, yeah, no worries. I'm sure everyone gets the same initial letter - I just didn't realize (until /u/tonytaylor85 pointed it out in this thread) that everyone gets the same letter every time. 




 Why? Seriously? It's literally a Representative's job to be responsive to constituents. This sort of thing could _really_ piss someone off, particularly the type of person who takes the time to contact their Representative twice about the same issue.

And you don't need unique letters for each person, just succeeding letters: 1st inquiry, 2nd inquiry, etc. And probably after the second, a valid response would be "My position hasn't changed since the last letter." Hell, even that would be better than sending the same letter the second time.

It'd be as simple as a spreadsheet. Even small businesses handle more workflow than that... 




 It's surprising to me that it wasn't updated, yes. I would think they have a simple procedure to avoid exactly this situation. 




 Ignore the haters - congratulations! You look great! 




 Internationally respected human rights lawyer is a damn good catch. 




 Downtown is safe during Westobou, particularly the old Academy. It's kinda odd to claim otherwise, really.

I know I'll be there. 




 *Katy Perry 




 Nested cubes rotating in succession. 




 No, just go back to /u/TheBrokenWorld's suggestion. "Doing nothing" and your awful idea aren't the only two options. 




 Or between movies. 




 Realized how great this is last weekend on a road trip.

When in unfamiliar towns on back roads, there are often a lot of turns. I was behind an impromptu caravan and they all went right when I thought I was supposed to go left. I had about 3 seconds to decide and the watch allowed me to verify to go left.

Not much but it was pretty damn nice. 




 Awareness does have value. 




 It was yesterday. Allen's camp said a video of it would be on their website by Monday. 




 I'm not quite there yet but did just walk out of Costco with more cash than I arrived with. 




 Rick Allen said his supporters wouldn't feel comfortable in a mosque.

He apparently thinks that is a valid reason. 




 But where? The whole nation has this problem. 




 Most of downtown doesn't fit the "frat boy" stereotype. It's actually the exception. Go to The Loft for starters.

And I agree that online dating isn't bad. Why expect to randomly run into a compatible partner? That's inefficient as fuck. 




 Well... it's printed on each panel so yeah. 




 I think this exists. 




 But it's vital that we pay attention and participate. 




 Wait what's her new addiction? 




 Yup. As a Georgian, it was great knowing my vote mattered. 




 Good start though. Give them that. For what it's worth, I'm a gay atheist (not in a Muslim majority country). 




 Oh! _This'll_ show the conservative commentators of my local paper! 




 I hate ultra orthodox everything. 




 You know what? Fuck you, man. The same could be done for Christianity. Islam =/= terrorism.

Edit: And based on your short comment history, this is your "thing". People like you make the world a worse place. 




 Man it was so exciting to watch. Every Tuesday was "Super Tuesday" and you never knew who would be ahead week to week.

It was one of the best elections I've ever witnessed. 









 [Here's](http://www.wfxg.com/story/26621875/who-called-off-congressional-debate-at-mosque) an article from WFXG about the kerfuffle. 














 After reading the article that is the only source for the Wikipedia entry, and perusing the restaurant's English site, I don't see any evidence that the same restaurant has been in business for 900 years (regardless of menu changes). 




 Does it though? I assume this is the source of your claim:

The medieval town is mainly famous for its stone bridge over the Danube, built between 1135 and 1146... To complete the construction of this bridge, Roman workers counted on Bavarian sausages to keep them going.

Sausages were sold there at that time but there isn't any indication that sausages have been sold there continuously since 1146. And even if they have been, it doesn't seem that it's been the same business:

The recent owners of the restaurant purchased it in 1806 from the Regensburg State authority.

It's an impressive building for sure and it may have been used only as a sausage restaurant when actually in use, but there is nothing in the article to really support the claim that there has been the same business there for 900 years (which is what the title claims). 




 The source for the Wikipedia article states the _building_ is 900 years old, not the business. Or am I reading that wrong? 




 As a Georgian... do this. Make this happen. 




 Yeah it's not that hard to do just as quickly. I'm American and chose to switch to 24-hour because it makes more sense and is useful for my work. That was about 5 years ago and 20:15 means the same thing in my head that 8:15 p.m. does. No math needed. 




 I disable push notifications for this reason. Fuckers are mean. 




 I unsuccessfully tried switching 360's with my boyfriend (he has the silver model, I have the black) and now I can't choose Facer from the watch face options. :-(

I've tried uninstalling/installing and resetting the watch but nothing seems to work.

Anyone had this happen? Any suggestions? 




 Yes. 




  It's possible to refer to people without gendering them.

Not using pronouns in English is very difficult if you have more than a brief interaction with the person. I sit on the board of a statewide LGBT organization and one of our interns is transgendered (F to M). He and I were scheduled to spend an entire day together and I ultimately had to ask our Executive Director for guidance. As for his name, it was completely neutral and provided no additional information. 




 In my experience, clothing isn't really helpful. 




 Thank you. 









  Within the constitutional framework. 




 Somewhat changes the impression someone may get from your emphasis of "am". It was essentially "I'm not American but I've got a justice boner." 




 It's a shame your parent comment has now been deleted. And he had gold. 




 I think I've seen on cable news that analysts think Syria's passive consent would probably be required. Anyone seen that? 




 I hope the involvement of Arab states changes the equation.

Edit: I responded when the post was just the first sentence (not sure if that's relevant though). 




 The "OMG, it works!" posts are much more obviously bullshit though. 




 Deciding to change and then changing is one of the most impressive things anyone can do. 




 When I was in college and worked at my dad's office over the summers, he introduced me as "Studley Do-Right". Complete dead pan.

I would then have to exist as Studley Do-Right for that person... 




 Top 5 childhood games. Leveling up spells was so satisfying. 




 I lost 20 lbs on a vanilla milkshake diet after this surgery. 




 One I know for a fact is an army base. 




 Delicate question but this seems like a good place to ask it.

If someone's gender is not apparent to me, how do I clear that up in a non-offensive way so proper pronouns are used, etc.? 




 Just reading the word "trypophobia" makes my skin crawl. And I didn't know I had this phobia until reddit... (thanks, assholes). 




 [sniff] I love you, Mom.
 




 I didn't mean to be judgmental and apologize. As our earning capacity increases, we can lose sight of how things used to be and how things are for other people.

I recommend Revenge and Orange is the New Black. Both are very binge-worthy. 




 I wondered that, too. Was it more of a "not a priority" thing or actually a "cannot afford" thing? 




 Straight as can be (he runs with his blonde, model-level girlfriend). 




 Runs around shirtless showing off his ridiculously toned physique. For a gay male couple, it's one part awe and one part seething hatred/jealousy. 




 I agree. This is a good suggestion. 




 Old book smell makes me need to poop. Am I alone in this? 




 Ah. It might be said somewhere English is spoken but it's probably rare.

Do you know what the two different verb tenses are? English seems to hide tenses that are more easily identified in other languages. 




 I don't think I've ever heard anyone use that contraction verbally in that context. I only encounter it when it's the certain tense, e.g., "they have been" - "they've been"; "they have gone" - "they've gone". 




 There's simply no option for it on the web version.
 




  They've to

Do you say this? 




 Yup. We both saw it (we'd be doubting our sanity otherwise). 




 My boyfriend had a notification card in Keep this evening (the web-version ones that pop up to explain new features and you click "Got it" to close). It said that you can now share Keep notes and specifically mentioned editing among family and friends.

Unfortunately, we didn't think to do a screenshot and now we can't find _anything_ about it. Has anyone received that notification? Any word that this is actually in the pipeline? 




 I'm not trying to find racism. That's not what this is about. This is about the patently absurd notion that today's GOP - if teleported back in time - would be the ideological party of Lincoln.

And still no sources from you... 




 Voting patterns changed in part due to how the parties [reacted](http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2014/07/14/331298996/why-did-black-voters-flee-the-republican-party-in-the-1960s) to the Civil Rights movement. Republicans have not changed their position on economic issues, but they have on social issues.

And how about providing sources rather than calling people names? 




 It's been circulating for years because it is a [historical fact](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t source=web rct=j ei=_dkdVKX9LZWsyATU7oKoAw url=http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/reversal2.pdf cd=7 ved=0CC0QFjAG usg=AFQjCNHqFzh82rIE-WAnvqlfLHabrruCFg sig2=ohnzV_sPjxYxjvoSJyAZ5A) (PDF) despite people like you trying to change history. 














 This was fascinating. Thank you! 




 I'm still going to have to ask for a source. A family farm worth over $5 million may not be liquid rich, but it _is_ rich.

How many farms that qualify as small businesses and family farms are subject to the estate tax? 




 Inheriting wealth seems quite antithetical to hard work, personal responsibility, and meritocracy. It should at best be viewed as something we put up with for other reasons (e.g., property rights).

In fact, inheritance should be viewed as embarrassing. Those who inherit should have a much higher standard for personal success. 









 I'm dying here... 






































































































































 Hi, /r/charleston! My boyfriend and I are planning a quick one night visit and are looking for a nice bed and breakfast. Suggestions?

We are looking for something secluded and preferably on the water (marsh, coastal seaway, ocean). Relaxation is our goal so being near nightlife is not important. Oh, and gay-friendly is a must.

Thanks in advance! 




 I hope you're ready for your close-up, Augusta...

 I agree that it's not a big deal (I see it as I would any other drug such as marijuana). But it's not a good idea for law enforcement to break the law and enforce the same law. 




 I... don't think that's likely. 




 This seems... random. 300 people for the man who almost became President? 









 I'm curious then why my experience was dismissed as anectodal while the one I responded to wasn't.

Criticism is fine, but only if it is fair. When it isn't fair, it is "bashing". 




 Good point. 




 I think growth is more terrifying. 




 The "new" path? That is how the free market operates without proper oversight. 




 Well, I notice you didn't make the same comment to the anecdote I was replying to. As a proud LGBT Southern activist (on one local board and one statewide board), South-bashing is tired and not very productive. Minimizing my experience but not that of the commenter to whom I replied is a good example of how subtle it can be.

As for relevance, I responded to an anecdote with a counter-anecdote. 




 I live in GA (notably _not_ Atlanta) and have never felt threatened because I'm gay. 




 I will do a happy fuck you dance when I return my Comcast equipment. 




 Wait what does this mean at the end?

 If (name redacted) would like us to post the rest of the conversation, he cannot bring $15to the Metro Spirit office today by 3:00. 




 The planet is not your private domain. 




 I think "consumers" is the best response so far (and what your suggestion - potential Tesla owners - seems to imply). But I don't think Democrats champion "consumers" as prominently as Republicans champion "the free market". 









 Demographics happened to Regency... 




 Wait - what does gun ownership have to do with Tesla not being able to sell directly? 




 That was a statement made by _his_ attorney, not any prosecutor. I agree with your general point though. 




 Even assuming that's true, is that relevant here? Who's the little man that the Democrats aren't supporting? 




 To be fair though, Republicans carry the free-market-above-all-else banner proudly and loudly, and more so than Democrats. 









 It's the other way around, my friend. 




 The Right to Personal Dignity/Privacy 









 Cynicism is not wisdom. 




 Of course I'm referring to race. You must live in that conservative fantasy colorblind world, despite all evidence to the contrary.

Do you not recognize the racial problem in our justice/political system? Because acceptance of that fact is Step 1 in this discussion.

As for your last point... did you hear about the rioting and looting at the Pumpkin Festival up north, and all the hooligans who were arrested, and shot and killed? 




 One of the major problems with the whole Ferguson situation is that the elected officials don't reflect the community.

So, yes, vote. Use the ballot box and elect your leaders.

This strikes me as FOXNews playing the race card race card. If you don't think there is an issue with race in this country (particularly between law enforcement and African-Americans) you just aren't fucking paying attention. 




 It just seems like a non-issue to me. I don't see it as being a good or a bad/cringy thing. 




 Actual gay uncle with no kids checking in. It may well be more of an individual proclivity and not a in-born thing but I do have a very strong desire to support by brother's and sister's children in any way possible.

Whether I have kids myself is still an open question. But until I do, I try to divert my resources their way as much as possible.

I suggest it may be an individual thing because I love both my siblings. Were there bad blood, the desire to help their children may not be there. 




 Never been to Atlanta, I see. Homo-mecca. 




 If by "pretty large" you mean "one of the largest in the U.S.", yes. 




 Broadly, yes. But the Constitution was a refinement of the Articles of Confederation. And the Commerce Clause was specifically intended to help improve upon the Articles by giving the federal government more authority.

The Commerce Clause was designed to make the federal government more powerful. You and others not understanding that doesn't make it any less so. 




 If I come in during posted business hours and get turned away or am given a shitty attitude, I just don't ever return.

Simple as that. 




 Why is it noteworthy she liked her own status? 




 Um, no. Way to let hyperbole completely take attention away from any validity your point may have.

The Commerce Clause + the Necessary and Proper Clause do vest the federal government with broad authority, but not absolute authority.

The intent was to give the national government a level of authority over the national economy. Naturally, if the national economy grows, so will that authority. 




 I've met those who _claim_ to care more about corporate welfare (such as yourself). But actions speak much louder on this point.

And why can't a liberal complain about vitriol? Not a single person encompasses the boogey-liberal-man you're apparently terrified of. Also, I didn't excuse Holder of anything.

You seriously have issues, my friend. 




 The national economy is _much_ more interconnected than it was at the Founding. I personally think the clause is currently interpreted correctly. 




 I think it's the other way around. The ANGC probably wouldn't notice if the hotel isn't open by April, but the Partridge Inn definitely would. 




 How _you_ doin'? 




 Voter turnout. 




 What in the world are you talking about? 




 Serious class hatred going on with you... 




 Yup. If I ever meet a libertarian who is more concerned about corporate welfare than human welfare, I might actually listen to what they're saying.

Until then, it's disingenuous and a cover for selfish greed. 




 Noble attempt but there's some intense astroturfing taking place in these comments. 




 That this vitriolic personal attack has positive upvotes tells me everything I need to know about this thread.

Good grief, people.

 For the love of God don't give the reigns to the GOP. They seem to be too often blinded by budgetary hubris. 




 Jokers usually work outside the normal rules so it works well, I think. 




 It's ridiculous to claim employers and employees have equal leverage when negotiating, particularly with high unemployment.

A UBI would even that out that a good bit though. 




 I don't see this as necessarily hypocritical. If any one business in a market voluntarily raises it, that business is at a competitive disadvantage. The minimum wage levels the playing field.

A big element of the value of having a minimum wage is that it is required of _all_ businesses (particularly competitors). 




 Wet wipes. Dry is for cavemen. 




 Well, considering you have no idea who I am or what I do, the same insult seems to apply to you. 




  Ultracrepidarian

Is this an insult or what? 




 I think it's a diplomatic tactic to take advantage of inevitable sensationalism. 




 We're not talking ethics, we're talking accounting. Math is math - there's no "agreeing to disagree".

You might view it differently politically, but a tax deduction still costs the government money (just as if they were to eliminate the student loan interest deduction and send you an equivalent check every year). 




 Yes, I have. Quit being a condescending prick.

To bring up an example you used elsewhere in this thread...

There is zero practical difference between the government telling me to keep $20 more of my income and the government taxing me as usual but sending me $20. It reduces the amount of money in the government coffers exactly the same (and increase my money exactly the same).

Whatever amount of money you got to keep because you took the student loan interest deduction can just as easily be viewed as a check from the government. 




 A deduction based on student loans is giving me something I wouldn't have had otherwise, not allowing me to keep something I already have. It's essentially the government taking taxes from other people and using it to offset my liability.

Edit: And how many people does it take to remind you to vote? 




 Yes, they are "welfare". What else would it be? Magic free money? 




 Wait don't we subsidize the crap out of oil and coal? 




 Mot's is dog food.

Blasphemy 




 It's a very small segment of the community that votes. You have to buy a magazine (or have a subscription) because the ballot is inside an issue. Basically the Hill and no one else.

  I'd be surprised if Ebola ever makes it to America, honestly.

 The panel opinion suggests that obtaining a photo ID to vote cant be a big deal, because one needs a photo ID to fly. Thats a common misconception. See Transportation Security Administration, _Acceptable IDs_, www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/acceptable-ids. Since, despite the 9/11 attacks that killed thousands, a photo ID is not considered essential to airline safety, it seems beyond odd that it should be considered essential to electoral validity. 




 _Read_ the goddamn opinion. Judge Posner addresses all these arguments. (Spoiler: Photo ID is _not_ always necessary to purchase a gun.) 




 I counted up to the level all four had in common (11), multiplied by 4, and then added the 3 loners.
 




 The thing is... when you start thinking this, you've already started believing it. Because everyone younger than me is stupid. 




 So the top comment in a thread asking what websites don't show up on Google... is a website that is literally Google? 














 If this is the same thing that was recently reported, they would hold the person down and stick fingers in his butthole and then into his own mouth. 




 How many white people don't have a birth certificate? Many elderly black people don't because it wasn't common during segregation. 




 The reward is nonexistent so the risk is still higher. Unless it's a coordinated effort, it just doesn't make sense to do.

And I've never seen any evidence of individuals doing it in any meaningful numbers, and not even one bit of evidence that it happens in a coordinated fashion. 




 And chemically castrated by the UK government for being homosexual, despite being instrumental in defeating the Nazis.

He was recently pardoned posthumously. His homosexuality and persecution should always be remembered. 




 This tactic is such crap. _You_ are implying minorities are not _smart_ enough or whatever to get ID. No one else is. The issue is how difficult it is (e.g., driving long distances, taking off work). 




 What's the incentive? Eligible voters already bitch that their vote is meaningless. Why would someone risk serious jail time for one additional meaningless vote?

It doesn't make sense. It's all about preventing Democratic-leaning voters from voting. 




 It is... but that's why most individual rights are protected by the federal government. Those 3 appellate judges don't give a shit what happens in Columbia.

Great info, too! 




 Minor bump in the road. The highest court that will hear the federal case (the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals) struck down Virginia's ban.

SC officials are simply wasting time and money. It's very disingenuous for anyone with knowledge of the legal system to throw up their hands and say, "But who knows how this case will be decided".

We know exactly how it'll be decided, because the highest court that will hear the case already did. 




 Hmm. We should get a lemur. 




 Based on your logic, he could have married his sister prior to today. What exactly is the point of this statement? 




 Unexpected but good. Voter ID laws at best are a solution looking for a problem. At worst, well, politics. 




 Two muscle bears fucking is pretty manly. 




 To you. Simply because you don't understand the problem doesn't mean the problem doesn't exist. 




 Charleston and Columbia are now issuing same-sex marriage licenses!

Any N. Augusta or Aiken couples planning on heading to Columbia? 









 Anyone who listens to music without headphones is King Douchebag of Everygym. 




 I would love to see this group grow and really help develop Augusta's tech industry, particularly with the introduction of the Cyber Command. 









 The statement from the representative does not indicate they sent it via regular mail as well. 




 As this decision* will lead to the invalidation of South Carolina's same-sex marriage ban, I think posting this in /r/Augusta is appropriate.

*Changed "ruling" to "decision", after 4 net upvotes. 



















 Yes. 




 Probably. Best practice is to send an important document via certified mail and regular mail. 




 I'm a lawyer and own my practice. I will hire more employees when my caseload increases (i.e., when there is more demand).

Cut my taxes and I'll just have more money.

 The drawing style is incredible. 




 I just point out that there are two religion clauses in the 1st Amendment: the Free Exercise Clause (the "of") and the Establishment Clause (the "from"). 




 At some point in the past I read in what I remember to have considered a reputable source that the "greying" of Presidents has a lot to do with the age window men are most likely to be in when they assume that office. 




 The weirdest part is I don't think many people thought this would happen again so quickly. I'm 32. I very clearly remember 2003.

I guess I thought the memory loss was a generational thing. Nope. Much quicker. 




 Yeah my first time was not, um, porn-worthy. 




 Even in death, he leaves his mark. 




 That seems to me how it boils down. 




 I think it may be dodgy wording. Currently, the property is tax exempt and I think the question is whether that should continue if operated by private companies.

Never trust how a ballot measure is worded. 




 Oops - thanks for that. Autocorrect strikes again. It should be "continue". 




 hell, just look at the comments section on any political article on Augusta Chronicle!

Ain't that the truth (this article included). 




 The ballot language is as follows:

Shall property owned by the University System of Georgia and utilized by providers of college and university student housing and other facilities continue to be exempt from taxation to keep costs affordable?

I am extremely skeptical of the privatization trend and was shocked to learn that this seemingly innocuous proposal was part of a larger dorm-privatization plan.

I'm voting "No". 









 Very difficult because it is hard to rebut someone saying they forgot or were mistaken.  




 Well, no pressure or anything, right? 




 I completely understand that. But the issue is whether China's cooperation with South Africa is so essential that the decision to cancel the event can justifiably be characterized as a decision in name only ("You can't really blame the SA government.") 




 Right, that's it's a pressure. But it's not a live or die pressure, which would certainly take precedence. (I read your post as implying that it was live or die.) 
























 Done :)

 I've never had any luck getting my phone to act as a wifi hotspot (but then again I'm not that tech savvy). 




 Nothing that is noticeable enough to come to mind. It does seem to hog the connection though, rendering tablets and other devices struggling to reliably connect. 




 Good point and I think you're right about that. I was primarily referring to travel where I stay with family and friends (I don't do much hotel traveling). 




 Yeah that was intense. 




 I have one on all TVs and am considering getting one for travel. They are pretty much an integral part of how I access my digital media: Netflix, HBOGo, Google Play Store, Google Music, YouTube, multiplayer games, Photos, etc. You can also mirror any Android device.

It's a luxury in the sense that it's not necessary or anything, but that can be said about most things we buy. Chromecasts are affordable and pretty awesome.

 I think that's the entire point here... if the first people to get here can't claim any right to the land, how can the European settlers?

 I don't think it's a stretch to compare social mobility in Western countries. America doesn't exist in a bubble. 




 He said it was supporting evidence, not sufficient evidence to prove it. Minor but important distinction. 




 I don't think I've ever seen the colored "2 days left" feature before. 




 That getting an indictment is easy if the prosecutor wants one. 




 Would diving through the wave even remotely work? It was fairly narrow. 









 This is my first experience with the actual hive mind. That was today, right?  




 I'm not basing this just on the President. I'm basing it also on *the Republican-led committees*. All *seven*. Not everything bad that happens is the result of ill intentions. Sometimes shit happens and mistakes are made. All evidence in this matter indicates that's exactly what happened here.

You're basing your position on your own assumptions, and that's it. 




 No they weren't. All an executive order is is a directive from the CEO (the President) to his employees (executive branch government employees). Nothing nefarious.

On the immigration issue, I'm not certain but I bet he's exercising prosecutorial discretion to tell U.S. Attorneys to stand down on certain deportations. And prosecutorial discretion is not a radical concept either.

Edit: For the downvoter...  An [Executive Order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order) apparently is not what you think it is. 




 Totally nothing to see here folks! 

You forgot your source: the Republican-led committee.

And again, why are you assuming the worst motive? Everything you wanted to be true about this conspiracy has failed to materialize. So why can't you accept the fact that you might also be wrong on this as well?

Is it because you've made up your mind and want to attack the President, facts be damned? 




 Yes, they do. When a government employee does something in their official capacity, they are generally held to whatever government standard is applicable.

And it has nothing to do with a chain of command to me as a taxpayer. It has to do with the government being required to follow certain rules.

Short of security concerns, the government generally cannot prevent the press from reporting on its activities. That may (or may not) be applicable here.

But the fact that they are government employees is extremely relevant. 




 Conflicting reports don't mean you have to sit on your hands and not make an assessment about what happened. That's what they did. No conspiracy. Get. Over. It.

And I'm relying on Republican-led committee reports. You are the one who refuses to change your mind in light of a massive amount of evidence suggesting you should. 




 Or they were just making their best assessment at the time given the information available.

Look, y'all have beaten this Benghazi horse to death and found nothing to support your crazy conspiracy theories. At this point, why insist on assuming the worst possible motive? Seven committee investigations now strongly suggest doing so is unreasonable. 




 I agree he's talking tough, but I'm skeptical whether he will follow through.

And Congress is undoubtedly more powerful than the President legislatively but that doesn't mean Congress should legislate in bad faith or that the President is powerless. If they try shenanigans (such as tacking a law to refund Obamacare onto a bill to fund the government) he needs to call their bluff. 




 Did you even read the article? The committee found that there were conflicting intelligence reports about the cause of the attack. 




 No matter how many times Benghazi is proven to not have been a scandal, you'll never let it go, will you?

Too much invested in it, I suppose. 




 While true, you will always run up against things like the First Amendment when dealing with the government.

They are customers, but they're also government employees. 




 So when you said we elect people based solely on merit, you meant "but only in the last few decades"? Doesn't seem as lofty with that qualifier (particularly because the same can be said with regard to race, religion, sexual orientation, etc.) 




 As a liberal Democrat, I agree. Defense always loses.

Obama needs to respond with force. Start pounding the GOP in the media NOW and don't stop. Call their bluff and stand firm: your bad-faith legislation will be veto'd and you will shut the federal government down. 




 Isn't that the point? NOT to act like the psycho murderer? 




 You probably could have received the same deal, but you wouldn't have known to request it. One of the primary advantages of hiring an attorney is that you are hiring someone who is very familiar with the system and how to navigate it. 




 "Augusta was recognized in an annual survey by the Center for Digital Government, a California-based national research and advisory institute on information technology policies and best practices." 









 How on earth can you make such a statement based off one anonymous internet post?

You went from zero to drama queen... 




 You don't think gender plays a role in who we elect as President? Forty-four consecutive males is not statistically likely if the contests are truly blind to gender as you suggest. 




 Civil law judges are considered less powerful than common law judges. The roots of the French civil law system include a reaction to the powerful judges prior to the French Revolution who protected the aristocracy.

Importantly, civil judges generally cannot invalidate legislation. This alone makes common law judges much more powerful. 




 Is it what I'm thinking of? Overgrown and looking like something out of Walking Dead? 




 The downtown is subpar relative to Greenville, I'll agree. But it's not bad on its own. I work and play mostly downtown and love it.

Have you been to Craft   Vine? That is a great bar. So is Bee's Knees. There's some room to grow but we definitely have some good bars.

I will have to completely disagree about the restaurants. Frog Hollow was singled out by GQ magazine as a must visit restaurant. And if we are extending out beyond downtown (which I don't think your original complaint was limited to downtown), there's Oliviana's, Fifth and Finch, Tako Sushi, Manuel's, Calvert's, La Maison, and 5 O'clock Bistro. Augusta is known for having many restaurants because of Masters week: many can make enough that one week to survive all year.

I'll also have to strongly disagree about the outdoor aspect. We host the largest Ironman in the country, are the home of disc golf, have a nice river and a canal, great bike trails, and generally pleasant weather. If you think Augusta isn't an "outdoor town", I suggest you're not taking advantage of what it offers.

As for live sporting - I'll agree except for the GreenJackets. But I see that as a function of size. How many cities our size have a lot of live sporting options? Ditto for live music.

Finally, as an unmarried professional, Augusta is overflowing with dating opportunities (and I'm a gay man which limits the pool significantly). Granted, I'm in a three year relationship but am involved and attend SO many things for the young professional crowd and EVERYONE is single.

Overall, my view is that your attitude plays a big part in all this. If you think Augusta sucks, you'll focus on the negative and Augusta will suck. But if you focus on the positive, you will see a city exploding with new and exciting things.

I love it here, and can back that up quite easily. 




 Do you mind being specific (as to "a lot to complain about" and "doesn't compare to many other cities this size")?

The tone of this post and your original one are quite different. If you agree about Augusta being an objectively nice place to live, why would you pity someone who is moving here? 









 Try Auben Realty for housing. They are local and do a great job.

For live music, Sky City will likely be your venue. Whiskey Bar, Stillwater, Craft   Vine, and Bee's Knees are a few of the great bars downtown (off the top of my head).

As for touristy stuff, there's the canal and the river. I personally love all things canal but you're arriving in the winter so it won't really be accessible for a few months. 




 OP, don't listen to folks like this. Augusta has a large melancholy band of pessimists that poop on everything about Augusta.

The area is objectively nice: good climate, good economy, cheap standard of living, access to outdoor activities, plenty of restaurants, etc.

Plus we just built the first new nuclear reactors in the country and are now the home of the U.S. Army's Cyber Command (fun tech development).

Welcome and I hope you enjoy our city! 




 If it's a jobs program, let's call it what it is. 




 I pretty much agree with your entire analysis but question where the line is. First Amendment freedom of speech is a political and legal right, and it should be.

Private freedom of speech can't be political or legal, or you quickly run into enforcement problems with the First Amendment.

So is it social pressure? That's seem to be all that it can be. And that is almost by definition lacking in consensus. But if there is consensus, like: Black people are worse than white people simply because they are black, can't a position win?

We value the free market of ideas *in search of the truth*. If it leads us to that truth, why tolerate the falsehood? 




 I disagree. The will of the people - as a whole - is best expressed during a Presidential election because everyone gets to vote for the candidates. There are 435 House races and 33/34 Senate races during each midterm election; it is hard to determine whether voters in those races were voting for or against any person other than those in each race (such as the President).

The recent election was certainly a Republican win. But it did not represent the will of the people as far as the President's policies are concerned nearly as well as the 2012 election did. 




  Freedom of Speech, as an idea, ... almost certainly covers any kind of institutional or mob-based attacks against speech

Source? At least in the United States, it refers almost exclusively to government attacks against speech.

Edit: How would a private right of free speech even work or be enforced? If I disagree with someone's racism and therefore refuse to do business with them, am I to be somehow forced to do business with them so as not to violate their private freedom of speech? Wouldn't that then be a violation of my First Amendment rights if the government stifles my speech to protect the speech of another? 




  Freedom of speech is a concept which can be extended to anyone trying to suppress speech.

Is it though? At least in America, it almost exclusively refers to the First Amendment version, i.e., no *government* interference.

I'm not really aware of any generally accepted concept of free speech that holds everyone should be allowed to say anything without repercussions from private individuals.

(Same edit from another post in this thread) Edit: How would a private right of free speech even work or be enforced? If I disagree with someone's racism and therefore refuse to do business with them, am I to be somehow forced to do business with them so as not to violate their private freedom of speech?

 Adding my anecdotal experience: smoked on and off for 15 years and have been smoke free for 3 thanks to e-cigs (don't smoke those either). 




 The veto power doesn't make him a king. But it does represent something of a People's Veto in the sense that the President is the only federal elected official who is accountable to every U.S. citizen.

Congress can't really claim to represent the will of the country like the President can. 




 The mortgage modification process is a joke in its entirety. The shenanigans aren't limited to Ocwen. 




 Didn't he basically ignore the multiplier notice though? I don't think Uber fleeced him, he just didn't pay attention. 




 Fairly certain I've ridden a dirt bike there. Weird/awesome place. 




 The President is also the only one in the federal government essentially elected by the entire country. 




 67? No way. 




 That's like saying if you are pro-Second Amendment, you are pro-forcing-people-to-become-gun-makers. In reality, there will likely *never* be a shortage of doctors or gun makers to that extent as long as a functioning society exists (because of market forces).

Edit: Another and perhaps better example would be attorneys. We guarantee due process of law, so if there is ever a shortage of attorneys, I guess we'd have to force people to go to law school.

 The county clerks likely took an oath to uphold the U.S. and state constitutions so if any particular clerk wanted to issue licenses, they probably could. 




 The only real salient point is jurisdiction. A federal district judge in one state doesn't have jurisdiction over any other state.

Federal appellate judges have jurisdiction over multiple states, and the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over all states. 




 Why not just move to another country where taxes don't exist? Somalia might be a good choice.

Or do you enjoy that violence funded peace and security provided by the U.S. military via tax dollars too much? 




 A sizeable percentage of Americans actually probably would, though. 




 But the savings will accrue to the private landlord by way of a tax exemption. It's a direct diversion of taxpayer money to a private company.

If you're for privatization, fine. But private, nonprofit companies should pay taxes. 




 Be prepared. I've been practicing for 7 years and still get nervous (and older attorneys all tell me the same thing). Use your nerves as a weapon against being unprepared. You can stutter and fumble as long as you are prepared.

Other than that - practice. It simply comes with doing it over and over again. 




 If there's one vote that shows that voters had no idea what they were doing (with regard to this particular vote), it's:

**Georgia Referendum 1 - College Tax Exempt: 73% yes; 27% no**

What ideology supports extending state tax breaks to private companies? Certainly not the conservative one.

 Yes, I think they are real people in Columbia County (a post lists their names but I'm not going to link to it).

It's creepy to me because of the heavily implied "order" to vote for Republicans if you live in Columbia County. Also that the county is some sort of monolithic voting block. 




 I know at least one other person who doesn't support the minimum wage being increased to $10.10 because then they would be making minimum wage, and I honestly just don't get the mentality.

 What sort of assumptions? 




 Hey I'm just trying to offer insight into something you asked about, and I have done nothing but discuss the issue with you in a respectful manner.

No need to be dismissive. 




 I _can_ distinguish between the two. But I also know that people with power tend to use that power. Keeping the two departments separate does not mean the owner's influence isn't felt: who is hired/fired, who is promoted, who gets invited to lunch, etc.

And then, yes, there are the people who cannot or do not distinguish the two. If you're worried about how the paper is perceived, it's not enough to say, "Well they shouldn't think that." They _do_, and that's the reality that must be dealt with.

_The Augusta Chronicle_ consistently wins awards and that speaks very well of the reporting side. But there's always that nagging thought that supporting the paper means you're supporting the editorial staff (because, well, you are to a degree - you're giving it a platform).

My main point is that the paper is perceived as a whole, facts be damned. This means that the hyper-fringe nature of the editorial staff causes people to shun the news content. 




 Well, I'm telling you that that's not the perception. Someone moving here from, say, Oregon, is going to read one editorial and immediately form a negative opinion about the paper.

Edit: And unless you're actually Billy Morris, I don't see how you can claim it isn't even _possible_. That's an extraordinary claim. 




 That's definitely a possibility, and maybe even likely. But when the editorial staff is so obviously *not* reasonable, readers are going to see that throughout the paper.

It's like trying to claim FOXNews isn't O'Reilly, Hannity, etc. Or MSNBC isn't Maddow, Sharpton, Matthews, etc. I understand the difference between news and opinion, but also know that it is impossible to keep them 100% separate in practice. 




 Can anyone in the industry comment on the issue without condescension?

No, Mr. Mortgage Guy, buying a home isn't a great investment like it used to be. Understanding that is the opposite of being ignorant about investing in home ownership. 




 It honestly colors every article I read. I don't doubt that the average employee has good intentions but Billy Morris has a Dr. Evil reputation (which is completely supported by the editorials - they're not just "Right", they're "off the radar Right").

It's not completely unreasonable to believe he uses his influence to push certain news stories and not others.

The editorial staff is hurting the overall paper. 




 Face for radio? Kidding... but it seems obvious that physical attractiveness is a key asset for anyone selling anything on TV.

 Bullshit. 




 Haha, I am horrible at keeping track of redditors but thank you. I responded favorably to that thread. Hating Augusta is _tired_. 




 Wasn't Broad Street the widest street in the country at some point? Or is that a local legend? 




 I second the how so (except for the editorial board of the Augusta Chronicle). Our reporters and newspeople are great. I imagine it's a cutthroat business and there's a lot of shuffling as people move up to bigger markets.

And has anyone else noticed the TV reporters keep getting more and more attractive? 




 Welcome! It's a great little sub. Please post often - you'll find a receptive crowd. 




 How so? I find it to be quite active for Augusta's size.

Augusta redditors will get out of this sub what they put into it. I post content frequently and encourage others to do the same.

But if there's one thing Augusta has plenty of, it's negative attitudes. Post more if you think it should be more active. 




 Island Seafood has been selling raw oysters for 30+ years. Johnny's has been doing the same for about half as long.

There is a large market for them actually (although perhaps not at a restaurant). 




 I think the line was that the tribe had an historic claim to the land. But, yes, it does appear it was horseshit (a prank on the former mayor). 




 It's not uncommon for one news outlet to get a scoop. But that is why I posted to see if anyone had heard anything. However, it looks like it was a prank on former Mayor Bob Young (who was filling in for Austin Rhodes). 




 Oh for Chri... I'm sleeping until the New Year.

Does anyone know _anything_ about this?

 The best way I've heard it put is this: The job of a defense attorney is to make the prosecutor do his/her job. If you think the defendant is guilty, prove it.

Once you understand that, it's not controversial. The alternative is due process in name only, i.e., corruption.

 Perhaps. Perhaps not. What remains true is that it is incorrect to say that terrorists are controlling whether we can watch _Team America_. 




 Recognizing a difference between a full ban and a ban of one out of many mediums is not pedantic. 




 That wasn't the original comment. The original comment was that terrorists are controlling *if* we can watch _Team America_, not whether we can watch it one way and not another.

I agree that terrorists are controlling whether we can watch _Team America_ in theaters. But that is a separate issue. 




 Yes it is. This thread is about _Team America_ and a comment that hackers are controlling what we can watch.

It is undeniable that hackers are not preventing us from watching _Team America_.

While related, _The Interview_ is not the subject of this thread or subthread. 




 But not via any other medium. I can watch _Team America_ tonight if I want to. 




 /u/timacles specifically commented on _Team America_:

Theres are 10 other mediums in which you could watch 'Team America' right this moment.

In reply to this statement by /u/EmJay115:

A group of hackers is controlling what we can and cannot see.

/u/SubHumanGarbage then asked if /u/timacles meant that the _The Interview_ was cancelled for "reasons OTHER than the terrorists hackers attacking [Sony]." That's a red herring and is not what /u/timacles stated. /u/timacles stated that the terrorists are not stopping you from watching _Team America_, and that is true. 




 No, /u/timacles is saying that this statement is false:

A group of hackers is controlling what we can and cannot see. 









 Holy Hell I never thought I'd see this. Great decision.

  Looks like they're trying to turn the mindless section of the right wing against net neutrality by tying it to government regulation. 

If my local newspaper's comment section is any indication, it is working. They are rabid but up until a few weeks ago, had no comment on net neutrality (probably because they knew nothing about it).

Now, it's a "government takeover" and they are armed with talking points. It's fucking depressing. 




 Sure. But if the federal court system is well on it's way to being entirely paperless, I can't imagine there are many arguments that it can't be done elsewhere.

Originals do not have to be physical (they usually aren't in federal court - the entire official record is electrons). 




 K-Pax 




 The U.S. federal court system is overwhelmingly, if not entirely, electronic. You don't get much more "official" for a government document than a court order.

Documents can be e-signed and anything that must be notarized can be done with a stamp instead of a clamp, uploaded, and shredded (not 100% paperless but just about).

 Yep. The price would obviously be a huge factor, though. 




 "Checks and balances" generally refers to controls _between_ government institutions to prevent abuse _by_ government officials/employees. 




 It's simple: the police need to be afraid of something. Not in a physical way or anything, but in an accountability way.

Again, grow up. I'm sure you don't think you are a racist. But you are. Thanks goodness humans as a whole are better than you. 




 The fact that you feel confident the attackers are black with no evidence simply demonstrates you are a racist. Nothing more.

Grow the hell up, man. Race is not a reason to hate someone. 




 "Conservative" can easily fit that description, though. If you favor "stability, familiarity, tradition", you clearly think that the way things are now is the right way. "Progressive" only means "the one that is right" if you agree that progress is a good thing (which we have defined "conservative" to disagree with). 




 Nope. You're just jumping to a racist conclusion. Nothing "earth shattering" about that.

I'm not sure if NY has a version of this rule but it is common.

Edit: Also, as to your third point, they were clearly outside of court and likely had just attended some sort of preliminary hearing. What authority backs up your assertion that this scenario qualifies as an "ongoing police investigation"? I ask because your admonition about commenting without knowing the law implies that you yourself actually do.

 Huh - color me shocked. Maybe they did do it intentionally, haha. (But not out of support for marriage equality, but out of a desire to put this issue to rest once and for all.) 




 My point is that the Sixth's decision may end "justice delayed" quicker than it would have ended otherwise. Without a split, it would have undoubtedly taken longer than June 2015 for all Americans to obtain marriage equality.

Do I think the Sixth intentionally created a split because they secretly support marriage equality? No.

 General incumbency "stickiness" applies to judges, too. And since the public rarely sees anything they do (unlike a legislator who has an easily accessible voting record), it takes a massive screw up for the public to form a negative opinion about a judge. 




 Even assuming that is done in every election, I highly doubt enough people read it to beat out the legal community. 




 As long as the term is long enough, this really won't be a problem. It doesn't have to be a lifetime appointment but as long as it's long enough for there to be turnover in the legislative and executive branches, the pandering will end the day the judge is sworn in. 




  It is not unforeseeable that community leaders would just appoint judges who will do what they want.

The governor of the state would likely be the person appointing judges. Judicial elections are awful. Generally, the electorate has no idea who is a good judge or who would make a good judge. The end result is that the local legal community (i.e., the "community leaders" you fear would be in charge were judges appointed) decides who wins. And that is a very tainted process.

Edit: I'd also like to point out that many states - like mine - have a hybrid system. If a judge retires before the expiration of his or her term, the Governor appoints his or her replacement. What's the net effect? Almost every judge retires before the end of their term. And since incumbent judges almost never lose, we essentially have an appointment process already.

Edit2: Also, even assuming races will be competitive, what is the likely pool of candidates? Attorneys. This means that if you run against a judge or lose in an open election, you run the risk of facing a less-than-favorable judge in court. This greatly discourages competitive races in places where judges are elected. 




 Alright, reddit. Tell me why this one isn't anything to get excited about. 




 Man I thought Thomson was set to be the next city absorbed into "Augusta". How fast is shit growing out there?! 




 Why do you think that follows? 




 This is just how we do things here.

No it isn't. _See_, the Civil Rights Act of 1964. How we _actually_ do things here is to weigh rights versus state interests. If your religion requires that you murder your child for being raped, that is outweighed by the state's interest in preventing murder.

It's a complicated constitutional area but a good starting place is to Google "levels of scrutiny constitutional law". 




 None of the rights in the Constitution is absolute. For example, your religion may sanction honor killing, but murder is still illegal and that doesn't violate the First Amendment.

Southern Baptists thought interracial marriage violated their religious beliefs, but that doesn't mean interracial couples must cede their rights to marriage equality.

It's a lot more complicated than your post implies. 




 You can contact the Ronald McDonald House. Also, the Augusta Pride festival always needs volunteers. 




 Don't you get it? Ending segregation was way more racist than segregation itself.

 Requiring tolerance of intolerance is a false equivalence. There is most definitely a relevant distinction between wanting a cake that is pro-slavery versus one that is pro-Civil Rights.

We don't have to pretend that all views are equal. We can disagree, but some views are less valuable (pro-baby rape, for example). 




 I guess I just don't see it. I'm born and raised as well (except for school) but my parents attended Augusta College, as have countless friends and family.

To me, it's just a name. I also don't get upset when people do whatever to the American flag. It's just a flag. And if the choice is between a great school without "Augusta" in its name, and a lesser school with it, I would choose the former without a thought. I don't think that was the choice but damned if everyone wasn't ready to torpedo the merger just to save the name.

And you're right, I don't have much patience for Augusta hate. But I don't see this as having anything to do with that. Georgia State, Georgia Southern, UGA, Mercer, Emory, etc., don't include the name of the city they are in, so it's not like Augusta was being singled out.

As for the level of involvement, I don't think it's beneficial in and of itself. Hell, this city went apeshit supporting Chick-fil-A as well and that was nothing more than bigotry. 




 That feature has [been around](http://imgur.com/SB3N5QO) for a few months, at least. 




 I've apparently read too much erotica. I was fully expecting this story to end with one of you bent over a bench.

So, yeah, keep us posted. 




 I'm sure not everyone will agree with me but I was put off by the level of outrage and effort given what was at stake. I saw more outward participation to "Save the A" than for any other campaign for any cause in the last few years. There were yard signs, bumper stickers, letters to the editor, rallies, etc.

To each his own but I don't think any reasonable argument can be made that "saving the A" was an even minimally important issue. 




 It's not an either-or thing. That was ridiculous, too. 




 Without making a statement on Azziz himself, the "Save the A" campaign was the most ridiculous thing I've seen in Richmond County in a long time. (I suspect there may be an equally ridiculous "Save the B" (Berckman's Road) in the near future.)

Pursuits don't get much more trivial than that. 




 Astroturfing. Probably copypasta from somewhere.

 I think he would do a much better job than the other two candidates. He's got a lot of passion and a track record of getting things done (the latter being the most important, in my opinion). 









 That's not a realistic way to change the outcome and get quality candidates.

Vote. History is full of examples of it working. 




 What? You're talking to someone you made up, not me. I was pointing out that not voting has an impact on an election.

If a candidate loses, it's usually not only because the other candidate got more votes. Turnout is a huge factor. 




 If I recall correctly, he is embarrassed of those and doesn't want them to be seen.

Therefore, thank you for posting them. 




 I'm sure the larger companies would figure it out. But I would think the IRS would be skeptical of any system that completely avoids the purpose of the tax rate. 




 Ah, yes. If I recall there are several factors the IRS will look at. 




 But the CEO of a company paying out $10 million isn't likely to be an owner eligible to take distributions, correct?

I own a small business and pay myself distributions. My accountant advises me to keep it close to 50-50. If I were to pay myself a larger distribution, I would essentially have to pay myself an equivalently larger taxable salary (from what I understand). 




 Would it be a dollar for dollar thing? The company could create a class of shares and pay $10 million in dividends and it would result in the same cash expense as paying an additional $10 million in wages? 




 Do you have examples?

If the CEO was set to earn an additional $10 million, but $9 million would go to the government as taxes if paid in wages, what non-wage, nontaxable compensation can the business spend its cash on that rises to that level?

Edit: I'm not denying there are ways. I'm genuinely asking. 




 Not voting for his opponent means instead of a 0, he got a 1. 




 Vote in the midterms, not just the Presidential elections! 




 It sounds like it's working the same way a very high marginal tax rate would work. Few companies would actually pay their CEO an increased salary if 90% of it would go to the government. The money would instead be funneled back into the company. 




 "Blame" seems like an odd choice of words for a major cause of economic growth.

  going out and maxing out credit cards on clothing and other non-seizable goods a few months before filing

If it's done with the intent of filing bankruptcy, yes, it's likely fraud. The difficult part is proving it. Plus, you're generally dealing with debts in the thousands so most major credit companies don't view it as a worthwhile fight (the big fraud fights I see are in Chapter 11s - business bankruptcies -  because the debts are in the millions).

It can be an embarrassing process but most people I run across view it in retrospect as a very simple process. The worst part is generally the self-inflicted shame.

Edit: And it sounds like you are on a much better path now: "No more credit card bills, and proper payment arrangements made with the doctors offices. I don't ever plan to do get into a mess like that again." 




 Or just file bankruptcy. 




 In my state, retirement accounts are fully exempt. As for cars, you get an exemption up to $5,000 (and many cars without liens are not worth that much). Home equity can be a problem but only if there is a lot of it. The court isn't going to force you to liquidate your house if the only creditor that will get paid is the mortgage company. 




 In practice, most people who file a Chapter 7 will not lose anything. Each state has bankruptcy exemptions based on categories of property. Any property up to the value of the exemption is protected from your creditors in bankruptcy. (The idea behind this is to prevent bankrupt individuals from simply becoming wards of the state.) 




 *in a Chapter 13.

A Chapter 13 is a repayment plan; a Chapter 7 is a liquidation. Judgments can be taken care of in both but in the latter, the judgment creditor will not get any payment.

In practice, most judgments are avoidable and the underlying debts dischargeable. 




 Bankruptcy attorneys who know what they are doing will require payment up front for a Chapter 7 (which sounds like what you filed). If not, the remaining fee is a pre-petition debt that gets stayed and discharged just like any other. Importantly, the client could potentially sue the attorney for violating the stay if any collection efforts are made (such as calling for a payment).

Of course, if you hire a bankruptcy attorney who agrees to a post-petition payment plan with the intention of not paying (because you now know the above), that's probably fraud and not dischargeable. 




 I think the point is that that's not exclusive to Atlanta, and doesn't not happen all over the country and the world (sorry for the double negatives but they are appropriate). Blaming a region really doesn't help the overall "greater good". 




 You don't deserve these downvotes. Homophobia is a national problem and implying this only happened because it was in the South is dangerous to LGBT people everywhere. 




 That's everywhere for you. Atlanta is incredibly gay friendly. 




 That's Joe's on Juniper... a very popular gay bar. I can't believe this happened there.

 No, stop with _your_ nonsense. Executive Agreements have the force of law, and are treaties on the international level.

Treaties ratified pursuant to the Treaty Clause are not the only legal treaties in the U.S.

 Only treaties made pursuant to the Treaty Clause. Senators alone have no say in executive agreements. 




 The top moves to the side at the end. Pulling out? 




 Start with Edgar's Grille. It is a restaurant owned by Goodwill. They are LGBT friendly (have hosted a few events for Augusta Pride).

If they have nothing, I think they will be able to help. It's somewhat of a unique business since it is owned by Goodwill. 




 I'll make your list when you got to law school.

The President is the executive pursuant to the Constitution, and therefore has authority over foreign policy. Exceptions to this such as Senatorial consent are just that: exceptions.

Asserting that the President is a figurehead in foreign policy is the height of constitutional ignorance. 




 It is debatable actually. The Treaty Clause is not the _exclusive_ means by which the U.S. can enter into treaties. 




 The President is a figurehead when it comes to foreign policy? Are you joking? 




 Understanding the Constitution requires more than merely reading it. There are centuries of practice and case law.

For example, there are 3 types of treaties, not just 1.  The President can enter into an executive agreement and on the international stage, it is just as much a treaty as one ratified by 2/3s of the Senate.

Also, it's undeniable that the President is in charge of negotiating foreign policy. I agree what they did wasn't treason, but it was highly inappropriate and they should be publicly shamed. Senators get to weigh in on foreign affairs in various ways. This is not one of them. 




 Free speech (as commonly understood in the U.S.) is a concept between a citizen and a government. If there is no government involvement, there is no violation of free speech.

 Haha, no. I would never email a racist joke at work. Quit trying to act like that is normal behavior.

And I think the statement is pretty clear. He emailed a racist joke at work.

Does that make him a racist? Not necessarily - the other option I gave is that he's a moron. But I would tend to think the former over the latter. 




 Um, the Moto 360 has been out for almost a year. No one knows mine is a smartwatch. 




 Sharing a racist joke via email to your work colleagues is not the same thing as finding an offensive joke funny.

If you do such a thing, you're either (a) a fucking moron or (b) a pretty hardcore racist. 




 Is this even possible? 




 Well... in 2,000 years their names will be just as historic. 




 This particular one is a case of top-down marching orders. It was surreal to see...

There had been no opinion on the issue _at all_ and then all the sudden: OBAMACARE FOR THE INTERNET.

The editorial staff doesn't understand the issue but willingly regurgitates the anti-net neutrality talking points. 




 One of these is my local paper, and the editorial staff is _insanely_ right wing (as is the cartoonist).

I have little doubt these are political. 




 Can you articulate specifics? As it stands, your comment is too vague to be anything but meaningless. 




 Source? No other gay group did any work to repeal DADT? 




 We are too rare to be so god damn stupid. 




 Misleading title.

The legislation passed the _Senate_, meaning it still must pass the House and be signed by the Governor.

If you don't want it to be legal to discriminate in GA, call your GA House Representative ASAP. The companion bill is still in committee.

They don't hear from many people so your opinion _will_ have a meaningful impact. 




 Then let your GA House Representative know that the legislation shouldn't move forward. It's in committee and can most easily be stopped there.

Don't let these folks do actual damage to people for naked political gain. 




 Article about the former Attorney General in the NYTimes:

 According to the former Attorney General, yes (op-ed in today's AJC).  




 Sen. McKoon from Columbus is the primary supporter. He may have something out there. 




 This isn't /r/news. But there's a legal memo by the former GA Attorney General if you'd like to read it. The memo explains how the bill will cause problems.

His name is Michael Bowers. I can find it for you but it's easily found online.

Edit: Here it is: http://documents.buzzfeed.com/BowersMemo.pdf

 Short version: if the government tries to prevent discrimination, religion can be used as a defense.

As long as the religious belief is sincerely held, it can be used to circumvent civil rights protections (such as serving gays).

Edit: Here's a memo from a former GA Attorney General explaining why the bill is a bad idea: http://documents.buzzfeed.com/BowersMemo.pdf 




 I am having a hard time accepting the claim that the flurry of new "religious freedom" bills has nothing to do with the pending gay marriage ruling. 




 Practical limitations aside, is this actually theoretically possible? 














 It passed. 




 Terraserver? 




 Or at least a percentage. Then schools might start doing what all other lenders do: evaluate risk. 




 Possibly, but an across-the-board time limit may be sufficient. 




 Nope. The nondischargeability transfers in such situations. 




 We could put a time element into the discharge for student loans.

10 years from the date of disbursement sounds reasonable to me.

Tax and spend 




 The chosen one. 




 Only if it's patentable (or in some other way prevents copy cats). 




 I was in El Salvador and I saw nuns get shot in the back of the head.

Can you explain to me why this sentence has only one reasonable interpretation (and that interpretation is not "I saw nuns get shot in the back of the head")? 




 That guy that jumps the fence I think just pulled a James Bond end-of-chase scene move. 




 Georgie isn't wrong. A lie is an intentional misrepresentation.

 Is "Should I get circumsized?" a common issue for guys who aren't at birth?

Genuinely curious. U.S. male here.

Edit: z or c? c looks weird but Google says c. 




 Clark and Washington?

A few grand for custom "BestCase" is an incredible deal. Do they have any plans to license it? 




 Who would do it, though?

Good government policy assumes each power will pull to its greatest extent. And that doesn't necessarily mean any particular branch is wrong.

Our executive is too weak. Having a mayor who will fight for a stronger balance of power is a good thing in my opinion. 









 Source? 




 I'm not saying "war zone" can't be used figuratively. I'm saying that Bill O'Reilly doesn't seem to have used it figuratively when talking about his past reporting.

And when there is an actual war going on (unlike in Ferguson), it's much more important to be clear about what you mean by "war zone". 




  Bill claimed to be filming in a war zone, but he wasn't stating that it was a literal war zone.

This seems very generous to Bill O'Reilly. He repeatedly used his experience in a "war zone" to bolster his credibility on war reporting.

Every quote I've read has no hint of anything other than a literal interpretation of "war zone".

Edit: This is a good example of what I'm talking about (from the [_Mother Jones_ article](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/02/bill-oreilly-brian-williams-falklands-war)):

In a 2004 column about US soldiers fighting in Iraq, O'Reilly noted, "Having survived a combat situation in Argentina during the Falklands war, I know that life-and-death decisions are made in a flash." 









 Now I need to know what would happen if the Death Star fired upon a star... 




 Option 4 doesn't require any interaction with the grandparents though. I see the merits of Option 1 but I would personally choose Option 4: prove them wrong and racist, and still cut them out. If my spouse has a problem with that, our relationship might not work.

And I don't see what makes cutting contact but keeping the spouse easier with Option 1. 




 It's not the same argument because families aren't for-profit businesses. 




 I support this. Our mayor is too weak - the office may as well not even exist (and governing purely by committee is not efficient). 




 Why is Option 1 better than Option 4? 




 Because "Apple". 




  10-20 years minimum

Probably more like 5-10 years minimum. Technology does not advance linearly (but that is how we tend to view it). 




 I'm having flashbacks to last year...

 I think he's talking about whether the U.S. has an "Ironman" suit. 




 I have no background in graphic design. I like the blue one. 




 Legally, Georgia had some bad precedent on the federal level that delayed the filing of a lawsuit. 




 I really don't see the stretch marks. I think I can see them... but can't be sure. 




 The secretary's response was that I'll need to talk to Principal myself to tell him i'm unavailable.

My response would be: "That's unnecessary and really a waste of his and my time. Please let him know that I'm unavailable to help with the cake. Thanks!" 




 I'm not discussing whether the classes struggle against each other. My interest is in /u/Vayate's claim that because you don't believe in something (e.g., class warfare), you therefore don't engage in it.
 




  47% (at the time, might be more or less now) of the US population pays nothing in federal income tax.

Romney's problem with that comment was going from "doesn't pay federal income taxes" to "dependent upon government, ... believe[s] that they are victims, ... believe[s] the government has a responsibility to care for them, ... believe[s] that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing", and then after all that claiming that "[he'll] never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives."

Telling anyone who received a federal tax refund that they do not take personal responsibility and care for their lives is an extremely idiotic thing to do. 




  Republicans don't believe there is conflict between the classes.

Ok. But not believing in something doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It's not enough to say that Republicans don't engage in class warfare because they don't believe it exists. 




  Republicans generally don't engage in class warfare because they reject the Marxist notion that class struggle is central to politics and history.

Are you saying they don't engage in class warfare or don't knowingly engage in class warfare? 




 God he's hot... 




 While acknowledging the harm this is causing same-sex couples in Alabama, I admit to anxiously watching how far this will go.

I don't want this to happen, but if state officials won't back down, I'll enjoy seeing the fallout. 




 ... 




 And by 2016, a large segment of the U.S. will believe that the fees and taxes that have always been there are new and Obama's fault (just like rising healthcare premiums). 




 A local state representative penned a letter to the editor a few weeks ago claiming that advocating for a proposed "religious exemption" bill is a continuation of Dr. King's fight.

It's absurd what they are trying to do. 




 The red mist would descend.

Is this a euphemism for violent rage? 




 For the "first shot", could the torpedoes be loaded in water that reduces wear and tear (e.g., fresh water)? 




 Neither question is relevant to your original assertion. Did the President enact the ACA by himself, yes or no? 




 Pointing out that the ACA was enacted pursuant to the Constitution (approval by both houses and the President) *is* a convincing counter-argument to "Obama is a tyrant because of Obamacare".

If your definition of "tyrant" includes the process by which the ACA was enacted, does that make the U.S. Constitution tyrannical? 




 Obama didn't create the ACA by himself. It was enacted into law pursuant to the Constitution. 




 There is a huge (and significant) difference, but there is also at least one similarity: helping others.

Unless he would send every dollar the government taxes him to help others to charity, his position is weak. 




  I would like to live in a place that has some personality and is not completely indistinguishable from every other suburban cookie cutter neighborhood in the country.

I don't disagree with this but it's a package deal most of the time. We've all seen the pictures of the Great Pyramids from Pizza Hut, and there is a McDonalds seemingly every few miles in Paris.

Simply put, where there is economic activity, chains are going to exist. A restaurant like Chipotle isn't necessarily a good thing to me personally, but I do recognize that it represents a growing local economy.

And that *is* a good thing to me personally. 




 Cuba is really only "untapped" to the U.S. 




 I don't understand what you're expecting. What metro area doesn't have a lot of fast food restaurants? Are you hoping to live in a city with no such restaurants?

Are there any examples of this occurring anywhere? 




 They are not automatically shared with anyone. That requires an extra step from the user. 




 It's an example of how expensive it is to be poor. Another example is Costco. If you can afford to buy in bulk, food is much cheaper. 




 Did he mean _because_ they are black or _because_ they are athletes? 




  Are you seriously advocating for a Cultural Revolution in the US?

Not taking the bait, troll. 




 And a waste of resources (which SCOTUS isn't a big fan of). If they reject marriage equality, the federal judiciary will have thousands of gay marriages to adjudicate the validity of. 




 For you to imply that I cannot use similar language against the enemies of the republic is ignorant at best and hypocritical at worst.

What _precisely_ do you mean by this? Why is it potentially ignorant for /u/Delwin to imply that you cannot use similar language? Why is it potentially hypocritical? 




 Unfortunately, I responded to /u/goodboy before scrolling down to see him tip his hand as a far-right ideologue.

There's a good chance he sides with Alabama and desperately wants to believe the federal government will back down. 




 Just look into what happened when Alabama resisted integration. If push comes to shove, the federal government has a lot more guys with guns than Alabama does. 




 Is it turtles all the way down? 




 U3 *is* pretty at low of 5.6% though (as are U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6). It's only misleading if you start switching between different "U"s.

The measurements all track each other fairly well so referencing any one of them can be a good measure of the *relative* strength of the job market. ([Here's](http://i.imgur.com/tWpxVFu.jpg) what looks to be an accurate chart that shows this.) 




 It's only misleading if you don't read the definition. No one is trying to hide anything from anyone. All the data (U1-U6) is readily available.

And if we shouldn't use U3, that just means that we've had much higher unemployment for decades. 




 U3 has been the official standard worldwide for a long time. Also, all six categories track each other quite well with changes only on the x-axis.

Using U3 is really only misleading if you previously used, say, U6. 




 Climate change and evolution denial are characteristics of the American right. Libruls aren't making them deny science. 




 The behavior of leading GOP figures over the last few days has been baffling. Until this week, anti-vaxxers were thought to be left-wing (holistic, hippie-types).

To see them willfully take the issue and make it their own has been so strange. 




 Holy fuck. The joke about Obama curing cancer and Hannity therefore opposing it might not be that far off... 




 There's really no justification for tyrannical behavior from the bench. Judges are paid to be there and help resolve disputes. They deserve respect but must show it as well. 




 Is the country itself a semicolon? 




 Libel is rarely, if ever, criminal in the U.S. It's a civil matter. 




 Oop, I definitely made that assumption and I apologize. I have zero idea how Croatian bankruptcy will work. 




 This is not correct.  Bankruptcy allows for exemptions which are essentially a dollar figure below which you can keep assets. Most people who file Chapter 7 (liquidation) are well below the exemptions so will not lose any property. 




 I add "@HHMM" when relevant, too (24 hour). 




 Thanks for the source. That will definitely complicate things for her, in my opinion.

Wouldn't there be only one of two possibilities here? (1) He was being detained or (2) he was not being detained (he clearly wasn't under arrest).

If he was being detained, there needs to be reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. What is the reasonable suspicion here? If the police officer does not have reasonable suspicion, he can just walk away. Likewise, if he was not being detained, he can just walk away. And that is even more so the case if the officer is simply taking his picture as a member of the public. Forcing him to stay would be false imprisonment in that situation (and there would be no investigation for her to interfere with).

As for an ongoing criminal investigation, wouldn't he be entitled to access to counsel if that was the case? It's not like this was immediately post-arrest (e.g. mugshot). This was outside of a courtroom after a hearing. 




 Mine arrived today!  




 The right-leaning bias is pretty strong in this comment. 




 Wouldn't they have already taken pictures following the initial arrest? The headline says this was "outside court", which means the arrest was likely many days prior. 




 Whether the cops have a right to take a pic of a suspect when they have reasonable suspicion that thr suspect committed a crime.

If he has a public defender, he was already arrested and already had his picture taken. Are you suggesting that they thought he committed an additional crime during or right after the hearing?
