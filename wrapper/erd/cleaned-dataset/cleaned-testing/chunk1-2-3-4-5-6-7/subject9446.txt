 Great!  Thanks so much! 




 Awesome, thanks.  If it turns out to be a particularly nasty bug, I'll definitely utilize that! 




 And your recommended course of action would be? 




 Any chance you could provide a link to those forums? 




 A friend asked for help "fixing" their computer.  They claim that IE won't close properly and they can't open Trend Micro.

I was thinking I would run some antivirus/antispyware scans (AVG?), and I'm definitely going to install Firefox and plead with her to use that instead.

But I'm not especially adept at troubleshooting computers, and without more details, it's hard for me to know exactly what the problem is.  I'll be going to her place tomorrow to try and help, and I was wondering if the brilliance here at reddit has some suggestions for how I should proceed.

 I would choose a super powered narwhal.

 I was homeschooled K-12.  My last two years of high school I dual-enrolled at a community college.  This enabled me to transfer in as a sophomore right out of highschool.  I got my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering in 3 years, and I my Master's in Computer Networking in 4, all with a 3.75+ GPA.

Thanks Mom and Dad for homeschooling me! 









 Damn, I want to know if it hit the boy or not!  There's a split second where the camera loses the soda-rocket (pop-rocket if you're from up North), and I can't tell if it hits the kid or if he manages to evade it.

Frustrating. 




 Exactly.  It depends on the type of pictures.  In most cases, no...but we should have a look just to be sure. 




 Get Ye Flask.

This is my favorite thing to say to bartenders. 




 I'd be in charge of setting up LAN parties to train and instruct the younger generation in the art of zombie warfare.
My curriculum would consist of the L4D series, and the Resident Evil series.
Allowed ages would be 10-17.  Sign up your kids now, before it's too late... 




 It's perfectly normal for girls to appreciate and enjoy this type of game play.  There's no reason to assume this makes you a lesbian in any way. 




 It's also for Computer Engineers.  I'm a CPE and a member at my local university.

 Hey Reddit,
My community holds a "Senior Breakfast" for the elderly folk in the area a couple times every year.  For the next one, I've been asked to do some form of humorous entertainment (nothing too lengthy maybe 5-10min).  Now I've done some standup before, but not with this specific demographic as my audience.  So my question is, what do you think the seniors today would find funny?

Feel free to recommend specific jokes, online resources, etc.  Your thoughts are much appreciated!

 We vote during the refractory period.  It's quite simple actually. 




 Gosh you two, get a subreddit... ;-) 




 I found it to be rather provocatively brilliant.

 Typo in the alt text.

And yes, correcting the author of a famous webcomic has given my life meaning and validity.  I can die happy now. 




 Yay...my post started a fight.  I can be such an unwitting troll sometimes... 




 It says I either show up in court, or waive the trial (aka, plead guilty/responsible and pay full amount)  :-/ 




 Yeah, I do feel I have a plausible explanation.  It was going downhill in the mountains, my car coasts ridiculously well, I was in the act of braking to slow down, etc.

So would I have to appear in court to take this route? 




 That visual made me chuckle.  Have a virtual kudos in the form of a orange cyber envelope. 
























 Aww, the author is pissed because Reddit never links his stuff. 




 I immediately thought of Anchorman.
Thank you for the happy thoughts.

 I could use a little virtual affirmation. Validate me Reddit! 




 My only point is more attention would be given to it, not that it would magically be cured in two days.  I was agreeing with the principle behind it. 




 Sad, but true.

 Your doctor called.  Your medication is available and can be picked up at your earliest convenience.

Tee hee. 




 Eh, who cares? 
























 It depends on what kind of park...
Most parks have nice trails, so going on a scenic walk is always an option.  Bitches love scenery.
Some lake-based parks have canoes/kayaks/paddleboats for rent.  Those could be fun.
If all else fails, ask them what they'd like to do.

 Perhaps due to the many layers of teeth that a shark possesses, this joke is referring to a shark that is currently "toothless" (no teeth visible in the mouth), yet still "has many teeth" (still hidden in the mouth/gums).  Or maybe I'm just way overthinking this...
