 So, I have a lot that I need to get off my chest so here it goes. I'm 20 years old and I'm a friendly person, but I only have a few friends. But, I only tell like two friends what I'm going through because I'm a secretive  person. I'm very social when I'm at school but when I get home I hardly text anyone except my close friends.  My dad was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2010 when I was 17 years old. It was so hard for me and but my dad put a smile throughout everything which kind of helped. He had this treatment where he did not have to loose any weight or hair and he looked normal sometimes I forgot he had cancer because he continued his normal routine. But, recently after some time off of another treatment we found out that the cancer spread. It went onto the hip, spine and expanded in the liver. It crushed me so hard, I have nothing to look forward too but I try to stay strong for me and my dad. He went to the barber today to shave the rest of his hair off since the chemo is making his hair go. Recently right after, my sister got engaged and I'll be honest with you with these news you are supposed to be jumping up for joy and I wasn't. I had to fake it which I feel really bad. The thing is people probably wonder why I only talk about movies and TV shows is because my life at home is hard to talk about. Many people do not know what its like to have a parent with cancer. It affects you emotionally and personally. So I got it off my chest, it feels really good.  




 I'm sorry to hear that, but at least you guys only dated for a short amount of time. But, you're young only 17 years old you have plenty i mean plenty of time to find someone else. Being 17 years old in a relationship isn't easy and you may be suprised a lot of people loose their friends because they get into the relationship a little more than they should. I say return it buy it for something nice, or donate it to someone in need.  




 Thank you I appreciate it! It's more of a hobby for me, but I definitely will look into the format etc 




 **My 5 Questions:** Huge fan of Anna's work, I'm fangirling while I think of questions. 
1. Is there one character, you wish you got to play again?
2. You have played so many characters, out of all of them which one would you not be able to be friends with in real life? 
3. Is there two movies that you wished had a crossover and combined into one? (Doesn't have to be a movie that you were in) 
4. Name a character that you wish existed in real life and you would be BFFS with? 
5. If you could spend an hour with someone that you never met before dead or alive who would it be and why?

 I loved the movie! I highly recommend it 




 A friend told me that he was bisexual.  




 I understand, but it's just hard for me to be myself because it makes other people uncomfortable.  




 I'm in your boat. I'm 20 years old, I never been in a relationship before and never had a boyfriend. I've been on a few dates, but none of them were more than once with the same guy. I feel like when you turn 20 and you go on FB my newsfeed is filled with relationship statues and pictures of couples and yet I'm still single.  




 No biting  




 To be honest, 17 is really young. I know it sucks to be heart broken, but you have so much time to find someone. I'm so jealous, I'm 20 years old and I haven't even had a relationship yet. Just take your time, hang with friends. It will be long, but the sooner the better! 




 You need to reconnect with your friends and family because this relationship is very new and what happens if you break up thats why its never good to throw your friends because of a relationship.  




 Beware, I have no experience in screenwriting so the format will be off and I haven't shown this to anyone so I just want to see if this is a good story and if I'm doing decent so far.

Charlie (V.O.): 
It all started back in public school, when life was supposed to be full of rainbows. But unfortunately, that wasnt the case for me. I hated public school. I hated the teachers, the chairs and most of all my classmates. I was bullied everyday because I was different.  Somebody named Johnny Depp once said it's OK to be different, that it's good to be different, that we should question ourselves before we pass judgment on someone who looks different, behaves different, talks different, is a different color. But I disagree, being different is what got me bullied in the first place and it made my years at public school like hell. Now I never been to hell so I have no idea what it is like, but from what I hear about it in movies its a place that I never want to go to when I die.  Anyways, now you are probably wondering, what about me is different and makes me stand out than others? Im hard of hearing and have been since the day I came out of my moms vagina. My mom couldnt afford speech therapy or hearing aids because she worked seven days a week and could barely pay off her bills. So I had trouble hearing what people were saying and my voice sounded very low and raspy. Because of that, I became the bullies number one target to torture and no one ever wants to be on their monitor. So one day during public school in grade 8, Jesse the most popular kid in school decided he would be funny and signed my name on the Talent show list for me to sing.  Little did I know, I was apart of his little joke and I was laughed at by the entire school. Ever since then I stopped talking to everyone except my mother and people used to refer me as The Boy Who Was Mute. 

INT.  DINNER TABLE- PRESENT DAY 4 years later 

Charlie is eating dinner on plastic plates on a small dinner table across from his mother who wears clothes two sizes too small. There is an awkward silence in the room and the audience can only hear chewing. 

Shelly takes a bite of her food and puts the fork down looks at Charlie.

Shelly: I know you dont like to talk about this, but hun it has been four years. Dont you think you should spend your last year in a real high school and make some friends? 

Charlie: Mom! I really like being home tutored and I like hanging out with you.

Shelly: Thats sweet, but dont you want to hang out with kids your own age?

Charlie: It doesn't bother me and I dont want to. I rather hang out with you. 

Shelly: Thats lovely that you want to hang out with your old mother, but you are going to miss out on the high school experience. 

Charlie: I think Ill pass. 

Charlie tries to change the conversation 

Charlie: Can you pass the water please?

Shelly gives a sigh and passes the water to Charlie.

Shelly: I think you are making huge mistake, you are going to miss Prom and so many other things!

Charlie: Its a mistake, Im willingly to make. Plus you only want me to go to prom so you have an excuse to borrow money from dad.

Shelly: That is not true, and you are going back to school! 

Charlie: Mom! Come on, you know I hate school. 

Shelly: I know you do, but it has been almost four years since the incident. I think everyone has moved on by now. 

After a few seconds, Charlie realizes he will not win this fight so he gives up 

Charlie: Fine, I'll go.

Shelly smiles widely and gets up from her chair to go hug her son from behind. 

Shelly: Trust me, there are worse things in life than going back to school. 

Shelly walks back to her seat and talks about the things they need to get for Charlie for school. 

FOCUSES ON CHARLIE VOICE OVER

VO: Charlie looks at Shelly, 
I knew it was a bad idea and I would have had done anything for me not to go back to school, but seeing the smile on my moms face and seeing how happy she is, is something I havent seen in a really long time so I didnt want to disappoint her. I mean how bad could going back to school can be? I mean having cancer is pretty bad and way worse than going back to school so it shouldnt be bad, or at least I hope so. 






INT:  IN THE CAR 
TEXT 2 MONTHS LATER- September 2015

Old car drives in front of the high school

Charlie looks at the high school silently and sees people walking into the building through his window.

Shelly: That door is not going to open its self. 

Charlie: I know, I guess I wish I didnt have to go back.

Shelly: I know its going to be hard, the first few days wont be easy but do it for me okay.

Charlie looks at his mother

Charlie: Im only doing this for you.

Shelly  fakes a smile 

The bell rings

Shelly: That is time for you to go.

She leans into her son for a hug and Charlie walks a little bit from the car with his backpack turns to face his mother before he walks to the building. 

Shelly puts the window down and yells

Shelly:  I made your favourite for lunch today!!

Charlie: Thank you! See you later.

Shelly: Ill pick you up when school is done. Dont forget to use your voice okay!

Charlie: Thanks mom! 

Charlie waves to his mom and she drives away. Charlie turns around to the school 

Charlie: Welcome to hell Charlie (mutters to himself) 

Kid 1 walks by to see Charlie not moving and staring at the school

Kid 1: You know that you have to move your legs to get to class.

Charlie looks at Kid 1 and tries to speak but nothing comes out 

Kid 1: Weirdo (walks away) 

Charlie breathes in and out 

Charlie: Great! Im already on a great start, WOOT! (sarcastically and mutters to himself and walks to school building)

INT: Class Hallways
Charlie walks to his first class and peaks through the window- he sees that the teacher is already started so he opens the door.

Mr. Evans stops talking and looks at Charlie

Mr. Evans: Youre late

Charlie mouths sorry and walks to his seat

Mr. Evans: Whats your name boy?

Charlie didnt hear and his classmates start to laugh and takes a seat

Mr. Evans talks in a louder tone 

Mr. Evans:  Whats your name boy?

Charlie realizes that Mr. Evans asked him a question and mouths sorry and gets paper and writes his name. Mr. Evans has a confused look on his face. 

Some of his classmates remembered him, including Jesse 

Mr. Evans: Charlie, nice name, but next time come to my class on time. Okay?

Charlie nods to the teacher

Jesse: Charlie buddy! I didnt recognize you at first! Where have you been? 

Charlie ignores Jesse and focuses on the teacher

Jesse: Probably working towards in becoming the next Helen Keller, how is that working out for you (says in a joking way)  

Charlie starts to sink into his chair 

Mr. Evans: Enough Jesse!! Now we are going to discuss about Scarlett Letter. Has anyone heard of it?

Abby raises her hand

Mr. Evans: Yes Abby? 

Abby: I watched Easy A does that count?

The class laughs

Mr. Evans: What does Easy A have to do with the Scarlett Letter? (confused)

Abby: Emma Stone character had to read the book in the movie.

Mr. Evans: Well if Emma Stone had to read it, then all of you have to read the first twenty pages.

The whole class groans 

Mr. Evans: Welcome back to school ladies and gentleman.  

Bell rings 

Mr. Evans: Dont forget to do your reading! See you next week.

Everyone in class left, except for Charlie who is about to leave

Mr. Evans: Next time come to my class on time okay? 

Charlie nods 

Mr. Evans: I know its hard to be here, but youre doing a good job so far. Keep your head high son, this is just the beginning. 

Charlie: Thanks (quietly) and walks out the door 
 
Charlie VO: Scene is Charlie sitting in another class 
As much as my mother is always right, this was one of the only times she was ever wrong. No one had forgotten what happened four years ago and when I walked into the doors. Man, I wished I had a time machine badly to go back into time right now like in the Back To The Future movie, but I know what is going to end up happening.  Im going to be in the same building as the male version of Regina George for eight months, which is eight months too long for me. Even a minute with Jesse makes me want to bury myself in a grave. Lets just say these eight months will go by very slowly and I dont know how long Ill last before I explode. 

INT: Lunch Room

Charlie walks into the lunch room and from his POV the audience sees the cafeteria 

Charlie VO:
Ill be dead honest with you, the first few days of school or anything pretty much sucks. One because you dont know anyone and two you're an outsider which means you're the kid who eats lunch in the washroom stall and trust me no one ever wants to be that kid who cries while eating a sandwich in the stall while the popular kids laugh at you.  Its not fun and I already did that for all eight years in public school and I do not want to go back there ever again. 

Kid 1: What is it with you and staring at people? You are starting to give me the creeps. 

Charlie VO: That is my cue to stop talking to myself. But hey its not my fault, Im Jewish and one thing about Jews is that we like to talk. 

Kid 1: Only if I knew what you are thinking in that huge head of yours Weirdo. 

Kid 1 walks away and Charlie sits at a table by himself.

Jesse walks into the cafeteria with his group and spots Charlie.  

Jesse: Listen up everyone!! (all of the lunch room is quiet) 

Jesse: I got a joke that I think its really funny and I wanted to share with you all. What do Charlie and Helen Keller have in common? They both cant talk (laughs with his friends)

Charlie VO: Jesse is very hard to read. I dont know his purpose for making my life a living hell. Is it because I get better grades than him or is it because hes just plain bored and making fun of me is entertaining for him. Whatever it is, I hope he stops soon because these Helen Keller jokes are getting old fast. 

Ms. Bomer  goes up to Jesse 

Ms. Bomer: Thats enough Jesse, see you at 3pm. 

Jesse: Are you asking me out Ms. Bomer? Im flattered, but teachers shouldnt ask their students out.  

Ms. Bomer: Enough silliness, you have a date in dentition.  If you do not show up, I will have to call your parents. 

All of his friends: Somebody is in trouble! 

Jesse: Im scared, Ive been a very naughty boy. Are you going to spank me? 

Ms. Bomer: Principals office NOW!

Jesse: Your last name is very misleading, its a shame you decided to be a teacher. Anyways see you later boys! Gotta speak to the Principal. (Waves goodbye and walks away) 

Ms. Bomer has red cheeks and is very mad and walks up to Mr. Evans 

Ms. Bome : How is this boy not expelled?

Mr. Evans: His parents are very involved and donate a lot of money to the school. 

Henry: Perks in being a rich kid (walks by and takes a seat beside Charlie)

Henry: Im Henry and you must be mute boy!

Charlie VO: I would pick weirdo over mute boy any day. 

Henry: Anyways, Im not here to make fun of you. I think Jesse does enough of that and too much in my opinion. Im here because I was assigned by Mr. Evans to be your peer buddy!

Charlie VO: Great, a teacher feels bad so he forces a student to hang out with me. Is this supposed to make me feel good at all about myself because its not working. 

Henry: Now, dont take it too harshly. Im just here to show you the ropes. Just a heads up, dont bother fighting against the cool kids because youll never win.  Anyways, Ill see you around buddy (slaps Charlie on the back and walks away) 

Charlie VO: The only thing that is getting me through this day is my moms homemade egg sandwich. When will this day ever end?  (puts his head down on the table) 

INT
The Bell rings for the end of the day 

Everyone walks out into the busy hallway then Charlie is by himself looks at his watch then walks out in the hallway and out the door. Charlie then turns on his phone and gets a text from his mother that she is running behind. Charlie shrugs and walks home. 

Charlie opens the door and surprised to see his mom kissing his father
Charlie fake coughs to get their attention and his mother/father stop to look at Charlie

Charlie: So this was why you were running behind because you were attacking dads face with your lips. Well I wont keep you, Ill be in my room doing my homework. (Charlie leaves)

Harvey: He didnt even say hello to me!

Shelly: Do you blame the kid? You hardly come see him. You should go.

Harvey: Youre fucking kidding me? I have to leave? That kid is my son remember?

Shelly: Charlie is having to deal with changes with going back to school and all, I dont think us fooling around will make it any better for him. I want him to do well in his studies. You can come back later, just give it a few days. 

Harvey: You should of thought of it before I came here.

Shelly: I should of, but I wasnt thinking as a mother like I should of. 

Harvey: Whatever bitch (leaves the door slammed) 

Shelly goes to the couch 

Charlie goes to see his mother who has tears and stands near her. 

Charlie: Why do you do this all the time? Go back to him! You separated from him for a reason. He was terrible to you, he cheated on you and yet I still see your lips on his. Why is that?

Shelly: He was my first love Charlie. We met in high school in grade 10 and married three years after that.  I dont know how to be with anyone else except him because hes the only person I been with.

Charlie: Just because he was your first, it doesnt mean he has to be your last. 

Shelly: For a young kid, you have an old soul. 

Charlie: You calling me old? (playfully slaps his mom on the shoulder) 

Shelly: You are very mature for your age. 

Charlie: What can you say, Im one of a kind.  (smiles at his mom and puts his head on her shoulder for a few moments)

Shelly: How was your first day of school?
Charlie: Not bad, could be worse 

Charlie kisses his mom on the head and gets up

Charlie: Im going to go to do some homework and Ill steal something from the fridge for dinner later. (leaves the scene)

Charlie is in his room doing his homework while he can hear his mother yelling on the phone and puts earphones in it to block the noise. 


INT: Classroom

Charlie VO: Dont get me wrong, I love to learn just not with other people. Why? People sometimes say the stupidest shit out loud such as 

Kid 2: So was Oprah the one who gave the I have a dream speech

Kid 3: Where is Canada? 

Kid 4:  Helen Keller she was blind and deaf, but how could she write books and  communicate with others? 

Ms. Evans: I think thats it with questions you have regarding history, but

PA SYSTEM: CHARLIE MATTHEWS PLEASE COME SEE THE GUDIANCE COUNSLLER 

Charlie VO: What did I do now?
INT: GUDIANCE OFFICE

Charlie knocks on the door

Ms. Swift: Come on in

Charlie walks in the room silently 

Ms. Swift: Take a seat Charlie

Ms. Swift notices that Charlie thinks hes in trouble

Ms. Swift: Dont worry you are not in trouble. 

Charlie sighs as relief and takes a seat

Ms. Swift: We havent met before, but I spoke with your mom once before.  But, I was informed that you need to complete your forty hours of community service by the end of the year if you want to graduate with the rest of your classmates in June. Now this hospital is looking for volunteer and the orientation is tomorrow (shows it on the computer). 


INT:   Hospital

Charlie looks down at the piece paper and looks up to the hospital and walks in 

Charlie looks around and walks up to the information desk 

Information Desk Lady: Hi, what are you looking for? 

Charlie tries to speak, but nothing comes out 

Rude Guy looks very impatience who is behind Charlie 

Information Desk Lady: I wont be able to help you out, if you arent able to tell me the question you have.

Charlie tries to speak 

Charlie: Orientation (speaks it very quietly and slowly)

Information Desk Lady: Sorry dear, but you need to speak a little bit louder than that. 

Rude Guy is really annoyed 

Rude Guy: Come on (mutters to himself, but loud enough for Charlie to hear)

Charlie mouthes Sorry and walks away

Information Desk Lady: Let me know if you need help

Charlie VO: For someone who gets paid to help others, she sure isnt helpful. 

Charlie gives up and takes a seat 

Emma comes up to Charlie 

Emma: You look a little lost

Charlie tries to speak, but nothing comes out 
Emma looks at the piece of paper that Charlie is holding

Emma: Can I see that for a second?

Charlie gives piece of paper to Emma

Emma reads the paper 

Emma: You are here for the orientation, come with me Ill show you where you have to go. 

Charlie: Thanks  (mouths to Emma silently) 

Emma: Anytime

Charlie gets up 

Emma: My name is Emma, my dad is a doctor here. I volunteer here often.

Emma gives her hand to shake with Charlie

Charlie: Charlie (soft tone)

Emma: Charlie?

Charlie nods 

Emma shakes hands with Charlie

Emma: Nice to meet you Charlie, follow me.

Emma walks with Charlie in the hospital to go to the orientation room. 

INT: Home

Charlie VO: Although it was only for a few minutes, its been a while since a girl that is not my mother talked to me and it was really nice to finally talk to someone that is my age.  As much as I love my mother, I cant stand her talking about Bold and the Beautiful. Enough is enough! Liam and Hope will never be together! 

Charlie walks into his house with a smile on his face

Shelly: Why are you in a smiling mood? 

Charlie: Im not (goes to drink some juice from the fridge)

Shelly: I want to come to orientation next time, it looks like fun by seeing the smile on your face.

Charlie: Its not orientation 

Shelly: Is there a guy that you liked?

Charlie: A guy? Mom Im not gay.

Shelly: Shucks, I always wanted a gay son.

Charlie: Why?

Shelly: I wanted someone I can go shopping with and hang out with. 

Charlie: You claim that we dont have a lot of money.

Shelly: We dont, but it would have been nice if you were gay.

Charlie: Sorry mom, I had a huge crush on my second grade teacher. I think its pretty clear that Im straight.

Shelly: Not even bisexual?

Charlie: Nope!

Shelly: Rumor has it, if you drink alcohol you can become bisexual. 

Charlie: MOM! 

Shelly: Okay! I tried, but I think I won the lottery. I have a pretty cool son.

Charlie and Shelly share a smile

Shelly: So tell me about this girl, she must be something if she made you smile that big.

Charlie: How did you know its about a girl?

Shelly: You just said youre not into boys, so whats the other option, animals?

Charlie: She is a volunteer and  her dad works at the hospital as well.  I guess its been a while since a girl came up to me and talked to me that isnt older than me.

Shelly: Hey! Im not that old.

Charlie: Your not, if you were you would be using a walker and living in a retirement home.

Shelly: You know how to make me feel younger (laughs) 

Charlie: I hope to see her again, she was really nice.

Shelly: I have a feeling that you will see her again.

Charlie VO: I hope my mom is right. 

 




 This is something I wanted to get off my chest for a while now. I never realized the word cancer makes other uncomfortable until you have someone close to you that been diagnosed to cancer and you try to tell your friends, but majority of them are speechless and doesn't know how to respond. I guess not maybe 20 year olds have a parent with cancer. I just hope one day, people my age will be able to openly talk to their friends about it and not worry about making their friends uncomfortable.  




 Love VEEP, I just got into the show and I don't regret a single second. 

'' I'm the Vice President of the United States, you stupid little fuckers! These people should be begging me! That door should be half its height so that people can only approach me in my office on their goddamn, motherfucking knees!''- Love this show! 




 Of course, I would. If that person is your bf/gf they should love you no matter how much you weigh 




 I say, leave it, but its all up to you 




 You are not useless, cancer is not easy for the people affected by it as well as the person that has it. You should find someone to talk too, because your keeping it all in and that is not good for you trust me from experience. I'm in the exact same boat as you. First off, you need to tell you friends or someone what's going on then you need to find an outlet besides school on a way to distract you. Second, you can't find a cure, but you can offer her  something like if she wants coffee or something and I think you need to tell your mom how you feel and maybe you can spend some time (everyone needs their space), but maybe look over photo albums etc. All you can do is try. Maybe bring some of her favourite things and do them together- movie etc. All I can say is BE STRONG you will need it and she will too. THE FIGHT ISN'T OVER. 




 I know how you feel, but the only thing changed about your dad is that he has cancer. I know it's hard and trust me I'm 20 years old and my dad has been having it for the past 3 years trying to find a cure. Last month, we found out that it spread. The only thing you can do is remain strong, find people that you can talk to, I go speak to a lady because at 20 years old my friends some of them don't know how to respond to the shit im going through. Find an outlet to distract you, such as movies, writing etc. It's going to be hard, but it will make you stronger and you're family as well! 




  Everyone is good at something, you just need to have the courage and go ahead and find it. Maybe you like to write, sing, draw? Find something that you like and you can use that as an outlet. I have been feeling really shitty lately and I love to write movie scripts. If you are barely noticed in the group, you need to tell your friends how you truly feel because if they are you're friends, they should care about you. You need to be honest with them, and if they don't care than I say they aren't your real friends. Quality trumps quanity. You have a girlfriend who cares about you, so I think there must be a few good things about you. I think you should join a club or join something where you can meet new people. It's always nice to interact with new people and possible make new friends. If you're friends make you feel like shit, they are terrible friends. You need to tell them how you feel. 




 I can understand why you are nervous because she hasn't been acting her usual self. I say it give it a few days and if this continues, just ask how she's doing or do something that will get her to open up to you. You're young only 17, I say go hang with your friends and go see some movies.  




 To be honest, I wouldn't loose the weight. He should think you're beautiful no matter how much you weigh. Your bf is supposed to make you feel good about yourself, not the other way around.  




 Just because she is not Jewish, does not mean you can't be with her. As long as both are able to celebrate eachother tradtional holidays that should be fine. You can celebrate Christmas and Hankkuah together 




 I'm not familiar with Sam's work, so I guess for me and those who aren't familiar with his acting he stood out a little bit more than the actors like Toni, Steve and Allison.  




 I agree 100%, Jennifer gave a good performance as the trophy wife which is something she has never done before, but compared to her last years performance in Sliver Linings Playbook it wasn't the best which I don't think that was her intention anyways. But that scene in the bedroom where she and Bale were fighting near the end was really good. Amy Adams was really good besides Bale who I thought were the main two who stood out the most 




 I like how Jennifer Lawrence is able to go and try challenging roles outside of the Hunger Game franchise. She's what not even 25, and already won an Oscar  Golden Globe, been nominated twice (possibly third time). She is truly gifted! 




 Hands down Amy Adams in American Hustle. The only thing is her performance was good, but some how every year another actress tops her performance. Amy is a really good actress, but she's starting to become the next DiCaprio (lots of noms, but no wins) 




 agreed that scene where her character and Duncan have an argument at the dinner party. 




 50/50- Because my dad has cancer and I know how cancer can be uncomfortable to talk about  with friends and I would want my boyfriend to be comfortable with the topic so when I talk about it he can be there for me. Plus 50/50 shows that it's good to laugh once in a while

Pitch Perfect- I'm hearing impaired and Jewish and there is a Deaf Jew scene and it's my favourite movie 

Sliver Linings Playbook- I just love it 




 Means Girls/Pitch Perfect  




 I heard so many good things about this movie. I love ROM/DRAMAS but, I don't know I couldn't get into this one.  




 12 Years A Slave- very powerful performance from Chiwetel Ejofor

Wolf of Wall Street- Leonardo DiCaprio (poor guy, gets beaten each time nominated for an Oscar and never wins- hope this is the time)

American Hustle- Christian Bale   

 




 Walk To Remember  




 Zombieland, 50/50-Seth Rogen is in it 




 Way Way Back, 50/50, Sliver Linings Playbook, State of Play, Taken  




 I'm not really familiar with Sam's work and this is the first movie I've seen him in lol. I don't think he should win an Oscar, but I thought he had a good performance in the Way Way Back and not many people know about this movie 




 I really did not like The Butler. I thought the meaning of the story was good, but as a film I did not like it. Oprah's performance was alright, but overrated. I think this was based on a true story, but I didn't really like how Oprah's character died. I thought it was poorly done, maybe that is how the character died in real life, but I think the writers could of added in something to make the death not a lazy way to kill of a character INMO. 




 I think for it to be nominated at the Golden Globes, American Hustle would have to be in the comedy category. There were a few minor scenes such as the ice fishing moments that were funny, but the majority of the movie was a drama. I feel like this movie will get lots of nominations, but has a possibility of not winning any awards because it was slightly overrated and personally I thought Sliver Linings Playbook was WAY better than American Hustle (im slightly biased) 




 Hands down Sam Rockwell as Owen in the Way Way Back 




 I saw the movie today with my family including my parents. And maybe this was not the right movie choice to go see it with because there wasn't just one or two there was like 60% sex/naked woman which made it a little awkward plus I was beside my dad watching it which didn't make it any better. It was 3 hours long which was a little too long to sit in a movie theatre for, but Leonardo DiCaprio did a great performance as Jordan Belfort who gets a little too caught up with himself when he becomes richie rich. Jonah Hill was in it, he was alright but I think Leonardo stole the show.  
























 Hope so, I'm a new fan of her work. Who knew she could sing 




 Cuz she is amazing slash she was in Frozen and her show Veronica Mars got cancelled but Kickstarter brought it back to life into movie form thanks to the fans.  




 Should I delete it and repost in March?  




 Sorry! But keep on watching, I just got into the series recently. It's so good! 




 Yes 




 **My 5 Questions:**

1. One word to describe the feeling you felt when you got to portray Veronica Mars once again? 
2. Veronica Mars is known for causing trouble, what was the worst thing you have ever done when you were in high school? 
3. Out of all the mystery twists such as (Aaron Echollos being the murder of Lilly Kane, Cassidy being the school bus killer, Logan's friend being the rapist in Season 3, the TA killing the dean etc) which one shocked you the most?
4. Veronica Mars had so many guest stars that were not well known when the show was airing, but are well known now such as Jessica Chastain, Paul Rudd, Melissa Leo, Jane Lynch, Michael Cera, Aaron Paul just to name a few. Is there a guest star that was featured on the show that you would love to work with again?
5. If you could take one thing from the Veronica Movie set what would it be and why?

 If you plan on being sexually active use a condom at least. This situation could of been somewhat prevented. You should find a way for her to use the pregnancy test because you both need to discus your options if she is.  




 I would tell your gf before she finds out  




 American Hustle was labelled as a comedy as well which it was not. 




 I don't have friends who like movies as much as I do. But whenever I go see a movie with my friends we discuss the movie for a little bit. The acting, plot and is it worth watching again. You know its a good movie if you can't stop talking about it with your friends I also search on IMDB because my hearing isn't so great I want to know the characters names and more about the film if I really enjoy it 




 V for Vendetta is one of my favourite movies. It's dark and is full of mysteries. I think it's a great movie much different than the other movies listed. Superhero movies are mostly for entertainment, but if you have the right writers and the right cast and director like Nolan for the Dark Knight Trilogly then you're set. 




 Maybe get her a stuff animal that says feel better sounds corny but every girl likes a stuff animal  




 I saw Her a few weeks ago and I really liked it. I thought the storyline was a unique love story that we haven't seen before. Congrats on the Golden Globe win, what was the hardest scene to shoot? 




 I only needed to read the header to know that your SO is not good, I would get out of the relationship as quick as you can.

 So I saw Blue Jasmine the other day and this is sadly the first Woody Allen movie I've seen. Cate Blanchett was out of this world. It was so good, I highly recommended it. What's your view on Blue Jasmine and what other Woody Allen movie should I see? 




 This guy is a douche.  




 It sucked what happened, but you got him back really good. But I hope your okay 




 At the end of the day it's up to you, but I say be a friend or keep your distance because that is a huge gap and its very noticeable when the girl is still in high school and where you are at the age where people have gradauted post-secondary school already. 




 I would talk to the police and I would tell your parents. This ''friend of yours'' looks like a ticking time bomb.  




 I know what you are going through. I've been hearing impaired all my life, I have been wearing hearing aids since I was 3 years old and I'm 20. Don't let your hearing disability define who you are. It sucks not being able to hear everything, I had friends tell me never never mind after I told them to repeat it but I told them please stop saying that. I just ask them to repeat it, if the laughing continues be straight up honest with them how you feel they are your friends, you are young and so are you friends, they don't realize what your going to and your probably their first friend with a hearing disability. You should tell them how you feel. And ignore those girls who called you ugly, its not worth your time  




 I don't know if you have mentioned it, but what was the cause of death? 




 I'm 20, never been in a relationship. Been on a few dates but never went anywhere. Had my first kiss a week before my 19 bday. It sucks trust me, but just wait you never know what will come your way 




 I have not been diagnosed with anything, but if this feeling continues I am going to go to the doctor. I've been really down on myself and the only thing that kind of cheers my mood is watching movies/tv shows. Anyways, I'm 20 years old, I got a friends mutual friends etc but I only tell like a few what is actually going on in my life. My dad cancer gotten worse. 3 years ago, it was very hard on me emotionally and I gained a lot of weight. My dad had a treatment where he was able to not loose weight or any hair which was really good because he continued on his life like nothing ever happened and he looked healthy. But about a month, the cancer spread liver, hip and spine and the doctors think the treatment will shrink the cancer but it crushed me in a million pieces. My sister got engaged and I'm just not looking forward to it because a little part of me is scared my dad won't make it.  I'm not as happy as I was before, I was the friend that cheered other people up but not anymore. Also one of my good friends was diagonsed with depression and has cut himself so I think that also made it harder for me as well. Plus there is this girl who I used to be friends with but I distanced myself because she has no filter and some of the things she says it's actually hurtful and she's kind of a bully but not intentionally. She also gets mad at the littest things, she was very mad that I didn't sleep over and made a whole big deal about it. It's hard to smile when at home and look at your life and it is not perfect 




 Dont give up, lol i hope 




 It really depends on the individual and when they think its right to loose it. If the oppournity comes if its a short-term boyfriend sure and a fling maybe. It all depends on the situation lol, i hope so! LOL we'll see  




 My best friend is gay and I hate it when people say ''ugh thats so gay''. Now there are people that use the word ''gay'' as a negative thing, where it is the opposite. There is nothing wrong with being gay, it's a whole other world that you should go into. You should not be ashamed of who you are. You are so brave to come out to your parents, I went to the pride parade to support my best friend, seeing him smile made me so happy its a community that he knows he for sure belongs in and he doesn't have to be scared of who he is. You shouldn't either, your parents will come around. You should join LGBT group to meet new friends. You are not a disappointment  




 My friend she lost it when she was 16 with her first boyfriend and she wished she waited because when she looks back she wished she lost it with her first real relationship and make it mean something. When your young you don't appericate it as much but it depends on the person. But when you play games or have discussions with friends, like who was your first time saying you lost it over a one night stand could make you regret it because it didn't mean anything to either person, but that first time will always be remebered as a one night stand  




 I'm 20 years old and I haven't lost virginity yet. 19 is a good age, many people have told me they regret loosing it at a younger age. I'm waiting for my first boyfriend, its a lot longer than I anticipated but I want my first to mean something than just a one night stand that means nothing. I don't think you will loose your boyfriend. 




 Not in order but here is my list
1. Veep
2. House of Cards
3. Scandal
4. Brookyln Nine Nine 




 By the grace of god listen to it  




 Make sure that she did not sleep with anyone else because there is a slim chance it could not be your baby. You should be supportive and ask what she wants. I think abortion would be the best route to go because its unplanned, you guys are both young, it was a one night stand but its all up to you two.  




 I think it's great that you were able to find an outlet, maybe explain to your parents in a way where she has to listen and say that you need this to help you. Do you like movies, TV shows, writting poems etc? Maybe there is another outlet you can use? My life is pretty hetic so I watch Movies, TV shows as an outlet to distract myself from the real world 




 Coming out is not easy. I don't know what it's like, but being able to come out of the closet and not know how people are going to react is very brave. You should be proud that you were able to do that, because unfortunately many are scared and hide their sexuality. Have you ever thought joining a LGBT group where you can meet new people and those that are experiencing what you are? You should not end your life, because if you do then your dad will win. You want to show your dad that you are better by living life to the fullest. You have so much to experience in so little time. Maybe go stay at a friends house? 




 Don't let it define who you are and make you think less about yourself. Go out there show it off and be yourself. Every one has someone for each other we just got to go ahead and find it.  




 Thank you, hearing someone else who have been through it helps me a lot. :) 




 Veep- Hilarious, foul mouth comedy- Julia from Seinfled is in it 
House Of Cards- Great dark drama- Kevin Spacey is in it 




 Easy A, Pitch Perfect, Walk To Remember  
























 ew 




 Pitch Perfect and Frozen are currently my favourite musical movies. But my favourite musical I've seen live in Wicked, I hope one day they make a movie version with the original broadway actors/actresses 




 No surprise there  




 Seriously? Out of all the movies to pick from a woman got jail sentence for overdue VHS rental of ''Monster in Law'' LOL girl you could of done way better.  




 Poker House
Not many people know about the film, but it's one of Jennifer Lawrence first films she ever done, Chole Grace Moretz and Selma Blair are in the film as well.

The scene that broke me was when Agnes (Jennifer) confronted her mom and the pimp. It was so sad because she has a gun in her hand and she's trying to get her mom to listen but she won't. Also if you watch the movie, you feel sympathy for Agnes character because she has to take over the parent role even though she's still in high school because her mom has drugs and alcohol problems. Another sad thing about the whole movie in general, is that this story is based on the director childhood life which is really upsetting because a few scenes were heartbreaking to watch. 




 Ryan Gosling- Crazy Stupid Love 




 Unnecessary sequel   




 I feel like whoever did the casting, focused more on casting big name actors/actresses than casting less big name actors/actresses who probably are more believable.  




 My bad, I was too lazy to write the whole thing. Sliver Linings Playbook. Garden State was a really good movie.  




 Iron Man 3 




 The Butler. I'm sorry the way how Oprah character died, was poorly done and ruined the movie for me.  




 I just saw it recently, reminds me of SLP. Even though GS was released before. 




 1channel and solarmovie good sites to use 




 Sliver Linings Playbook, Away From Her  




 But Lawrence still nailed it though. I wonder if Anne would of stayed if she would of been nominated twice  




 I suggest Poker House  




 AH was overrated  




 I don't know about the other years, but last year it happened. Jennifer did not win the BAFTA, but she won the Oscar.  




 I'll be honest, I'm a big Jennifer Lawrence fan. I have seen every film she has been in. I thought she deserved the BAFTA last year in Sliver Linings Playbook then this year. Good performance in AH, but her SLP was way better. I hope Lupita wins.  




 Netflix  




 Too many good movies released on Christmas Day!  




 Way Way Back, Her  




 Pitch Perfect  




 Does TV Movies count? 
The Perfect Boyfriend
The Boy She Met Online  




 Frozen, I know it's Disney but I'm telling you it's amazing plus Let it Go will be stuck in your head for the rest of your life. Not your typical disney movie. 

Way Way Back- Great cast- Steve from The Office, Toni Colliete, Liam James etc. Has a mix of comedy, drama and romance. Movie from a 14 year old perspective. 

Catching Fire- Dark intense compared to the first movie. Lots of character development and more entertaining.  




 Having a relationship or not doesn't mean you won't be able to enjoy the movie to the full extent because you haven't been in a relationship before. Spectacular Now I heard a lot of great things about it, if you like a coming of age romance then sure I would recommend seeing it.  




 FROZEN  




 The Way Way Back (2013) indie film. I was feeling like shit, but I left the theatre with a smile on my face.  




 No more drugs 




 Life sucks., but it is up to us to determine what we want to do. I know what it's like to wake up every morning and having nothing to look forward to. I know the feeling of how if I end my life it will all go away. But then I look around, I see my friends, my family and my dad. My dad has cancer for almost four years. Every single day, he wakes up with a smile on his face. No matter how much pain he is in he always hides it and jokes about his cancer. Why am I telling my life to you? Because I know what you are feeling and it sucks trust me. But, there is so much ahead you don't even know it. The thing is if we kill ourselves voluntary, that means we lose. And it's not about win or lose, but it's about giving up. Life has it ups and downs and there will be plenty of downs, but if you give up you will miss on so many moments. It's not worth it, trust me.  




 Thank you for responding. I keep on delaying going to the doctor, but I think I need to go because I want to know if this because of the news or this is a long term thing. Because if there is like a light switch that would be great because I would like to be my old self again 




 You should try to find a way to control your anger and find a output where no one will get hurt.  




 So I have been thinking about death a lot and have been since November when my dads cancer has spread. I don't know I guess when I heard the news it just crushed me. Now, people who know me think I'm this happy go lucky girl who likes to make others laugh and always smiling. The problem is that's not really me. I only do that because it helps me forget my problems. I have no one to talk to because it's rare to find another 20 year old who's parent has cancer as well. I'm not close with my sisters. My sister got engaged like a week after the cancer news and I still try to be happy for her, but I'm not. Does that make me a bad person, that I would rather watch a movie or a tv show then to dress up and go to a wedding? I mean everything seems gray now, I'm very talkative at school but when I get home I stay in my room and go on the internet  for hours. I only talk to people usually if they message me first. I have no one to talk to, I have friends but I'm a secretive person. I also am 99.9% have anxiety. I'm always worried, when it comes to driving- I did not drive at all last winter and driving a new car. When it comes to school and just every day things. So I'm getting this off my chest- if someone was to give me something that would allow me to die, honestly I would take it. I'm just not happy.   




 I do it! For fun, I want to post my script and ideas somewhere but the problem is I don't have in the script format  




 I know Pitch Perfect is getting a sequel but the plot has not been released yet. My idea for Pitch Perfect 2 is having Becca and Fat Amy lead Barden Bellas and there is tension between Jesse and Beca because they are aganist each other.  




 Just be yourself, it looks like you knew what you were doing. Give him your number 




 Hi Matt Damon, 
Is there one movie genre that you haven't done in a while that you would like to do again?

Also if you respond to this, I can say Matt Damon Fucking Responded to Me  




 My grades are good, I get A's and B's but that is all going to change because of my teacher. I'm hard of hearing and been struggling in his class. He is old school and writes barely anything on the board. All he does is just talks which is very hard for me to listen and then have to take notes at the same time. So I raised my hand in the second class asking him to repeat something and he said he already repeated it and if I stop raising my hand I would of listen. He is so rude and he thinks the class is so dumb saying oh its so easy. Also yesterday he was ''trying'' to help a student out with a formula and he said something that he says to his dog and he told the class that. I had my complains of teachers, but not to the point where he will not help, he is so rude and he won't even put anything on the board even if you ask. I don't understand how he got hired.  




 Books are most of the time better the film because of many reasons. There are many times that the actors are miscast and do not represent the characteristics that were mentioned in the book. Also, the movie can only be so long and do not add a few plots from the book due to time which sometimes is disappointing because we look forward to a part of the book and it is not included into the film. The only movies that I watched that were almost good as the book was Catching Fire and the Help. It is really hard for the director and the film crew to make a movie better or just as good as the book.  
























 walk to remember  




 INMO I left the movie saying the effects were phenomenal. There is more to a movie then special effects. Gravity sweeped a lot of awards but I think also why 12 years a slave won because of the story itself.  




 Creative title  




 American Hustle an overhyped film that did not reach the expectations from all the buzz it was getting. 




 crazy stupid love 




 Salmon Fishing in the Yemen 




 I loved it. The music was also great as well.  




 Thank you. After hearing positive feedback yesterday, I told my parents after my dad told me that the chemo isn't working. It was not easy, but now I feel a lot better getting it off my chest.   




 Thank you, I needed this. I'm planning to tell my parents soon. Cross my fingers and hope it goes well. 




 This all means a lot, thank you 




 Thank you! 




 So ever since November, I have not been the same. My dad cancer has spread even more and it made me in a darker place that I thought I would never be in. I get up every morning with nothing to really look forward too. The only thing that gets me excited is movies and TV shows which is really sad but honestly the truth. I used to love Skiing and I just went for a few days, but its not the same as it used to be. I told my social worker what I have been feeling down and thinking suicidal thoughs which come and go away, but now she is scared for me. Which makes it worse. She wants me to go book an appt with the doctor and she wants me to tell my parents. My parents know nothing, they think I'm a happy go lucky girl who likes to make others laugh, but when I get home and go into my room its a whole other thing. A part of me just thinks its my head talking and I may not actually be depressed but i have no idea. I just don't want to be judged you know.  




 So again another friend took me go to see Endless Love. I saw the trailer and I didn't really want to see it as well it didn't do so well on Rotten Tomatoes. The only movie I really want to go see is Veronica Mars, but any how it is not a bad movie. Obviously, it is no where as good as the Notebook or Walk To Remember. It was a cute, romantic movie and the scene where the main female character gets in a car accident scared the living crap out of me. Has anyone seen the 1981 one with Brooke Shields?  




 Great show!  




 crossing my fingers! 




 Be careful because he may just want a friends with benefits thing.  




 It's nice to see that more people are starting to recognize Elizabeth Olsen. 
If you like her, you should watch Liberal Arts and I saw the premiere of "In Secret'' at TIFF. She put on an impressive performance.  




 LOL yes 




 Of course, we all knew what was going to happen. But the movie could of been done better. It was so obvious what was going to happen in Titanic, but the movie was 100% times better than Pompeii.  









 Veronica Mars  




 So my friends made me see Pompeii in 3D. The film in my opinion was a huge miss and I will forget I even watched this movie because nothing stood out in the movie. It is so obvious what was going to happen. Kiefer Sutherland and Kit Harington star in this flop movie. The effects and the music were good, but the acting and the storyline was lacking. And I just realized that the poster for Pompeii that is on IMDb is actually from the last scene of the movie. So you don't even need to watch the movie you can just look at the poster and you know what will happen. Kiefer Sutherland accent was terrible and he should stick to what he knows which is playing Jack Bauer and shooting people with a gun. What did you think of the movie? 




 50/50 




 Agreed! 




 Ben Affleck/Jennifer Lopez for Gigi (KIDDING) 




 Okay, so I try to watch as many as I can because I find if I don't watch any at all the award shows are boring. Plus there are some really good movies out there. I have seen every movie that has won main awards and I have seen 80% of all best picture noms. So I look at the Golden Globes or Oscar nominee list and I just check off the ones I've seen. Blue Jasmine is a movie you do not want to miss. 




 Congrats!!! Being nominated for an Oscar is incredible  




 I always look at Rotten Tomatoes, because it shows combined with users and critics if the movie is good or not. It does affect the way you watch the film because if you go on a site that says the movie rating is low you will have low expectations of the movie and may not be motivated to watch it, but its the same with good ratings such as American Hustle. American Hustle got great ratings and I was so excited about it, but when I watched it I was bummed because I had such a high expectations of the film because of the cast, director and the great reviews. When I watched it, it did not reach up to its expectations. It's good to know if the movie is worth watching with the ratings, but don't take it too strongly all the time because sometimes a movie that is rotten is actually one of my favourite movies. So it all depends on the individual.  




 Kristen Bell in Frozen (don't judge), I had no idea that this girl got singing skills  




 I can see how he can be a villain, but also see as a hero. He is a hero in a way because he helps Iris out. But he is more of a villain, INMO. Yes he saves Foster's character, but I wouldn't call him a hero.  




 Channing Tatum- overrated, he's easy on the eyes, but other than that I think that's why he's only casted in movie roles.
Miles Teller- underrated- Spectacular Now, and apparently his performance in Whiplash stands out as well. 




 Hard to have one, when there is so many.
Bradley Cooper- Sliver Linings Playbook
JGL- 50/50
 




 I don't like Girls HBO show 




 So I just got into House of Lies. Honest truth, there is so much better TV material out there. This is not the best or the worst. It's the entertaining, it takes a while to get into the series. I would watch a few more to decide  if you want to continue on or not because it does get more interesting as eps goes on. Kristen Bell INMO kills it by far then the rest of the cast. There so many great lines in the show worth watching. I say give it one more try 




 Go house of lies  




 Brody from Homeland  




 Easy A, Pitch Perfect (saw four times in the movie theatre), 50/50, sliver linings playbook 




 This is a little different but Jessica Chastain went from a nobody to a somebody with the success of The Help, Zero Dark Thirty etc. 

Robert Downey Jr. 

Maybe Sandra Bullock   




 Did not like the Butler. 
Sandra Bullock performance in the Blind Slide was alright, I did not think it was Oscar worthy.
Emma Stone needs to stick to comedy  
























 Every single day for the past few months the thought of death has popped in my mind and I visualize as well too. Recently I decided to get these feelings off my chest and let someone know what has been going on in my head. Telling someone a friend that you feel comfortable, going through the sane thing or talk to a professional. I've been talking to one since August but it wasn't until almost a month ago i confessed to how i was feeling. It sucks waking up every day with nothing to look forward to, but telling someone how you feel and maybe meeting others that experience what your going through will help. I'm 21, you are so young do not give up! Keep your head up! Find something that distracts you. I watch movies and tv shows all the time. its the only thing that keeps me have a real smile on my face you are not alone  




 Correct  




 Which actress was originally casted to play Tiffany Maxwell in Sliver Linings Playbook, before Jennifer Lawrence was casted? (Hint this actress won an Oscar) 




 That's what movies are for! Guilty pleasures are the best. I have so many movies that I love that arent the best films but I love romantic movies. Some of them are not the best but I love them anyways like Something Borrowed and some are good like Sleepless in Seattle etc. As long as you enjoy them that all it matters.  




 So I watched the episode, I was wrong about Jeannie being somewhat involved with Lukes death. Look like Dre and his wife worked on it together (wasn't really clear). Overall, it was kind of a filler episode nothing really happened until the end with Marty and Jeannie. But, I saw a preview it looks like the aftermath of Jeannie telling her friend is going to happen next ep season finale. My guess someone gets put to jail.  




 His role in Sliver Linings Playbook, might not have been his best performance but I loved his role and Sliver Linings Playbook 




 Frozen no joke you will be singing the words after 




 Jennifer Lawrence in Sliver Linings Playbook the part where Pat (Bradley) is running after Tiffany after the diner scene where Tiffany said something like "I opened up to you and you judged me" basically I loved everything from that movie  




 Adam Sandler- I do not like his movies anymore.  




 It's hard, but it keeps me going. Find something even minor, it will help.  




 Every week I have something to look forward to. It can be a little thing like a bubble bath or going to see a movie or watching your Tv show. But that keeps me through the week knowing that on that day I'll be doing something fun 




 Yes!I'm excited for the next episode!  




 Now that you mention it, It looks like he planned the shooting  




 Your probably right!  




 To be honest- its just a theory I'm not sure but from what I got from the ep is The DA or whoever Jeannies friend was saying something like are you sure you want to do this, it will cause trouble etc. Then Lucas got shot? HMMM I think Jeannie might of said something that should of been kept a secret and it end up lucas being killed  




 I would just watch the whole series because in the show the characters do mention things that happen in the series and just knowing everything makes it easier  




 I thought the ep was going to be about the shooting because they showed it in the preview from last week. This ep only showed it at the endbut I guess we'll find out  about the aftermath this upcoming week. I like that the writers are finally going to show whats the whole deal between marty and jeannie. I think Jeannie caused this to happen because it looked like she told her client dirt on Dolla Hyde.  




 i was a bit disappointed too, but its hard to fit all the characters in the movie and get decent amount of screen time. I hope it does well because I do miss the characters and the show. I wonder if there is a new movie it will be her being a FBI agent. That was the plot for season 4 if it was picked up and it was kinda hinted in the movie with the Leo and Veronica scene  




 I thought it was good! It was nice to see many of the characters. I do hope more movies come from this. What about you? 




 Im def looking into getting it at the bookstore or amazon 




  I recently watched the series ever since I've been super psyched to watch the film. So I liked the film, but I don't know if it loved. I thought it was neat to bring everyone back to the reunion. I do hope for more movies because Veronica Mars is one of my favourite characters ever and I do hope more movies are made. 




 I just joined  lol i'm up for discussions  




 I don't know if this counts, but I was shocked that Sandra Bullock got nominated and won for the Blind Slide  




 Sleepless in Seattle  




 Pitch Perfect 




 She sounds crazy 




 50/50 




 You'll feel relieved after 




 That's okay, good luck on your stats assignment! It's good to let it all out! 




 Thank you for the comment, I'm scared because in the past I had told people about my dad having cancer and they don't respond so I'm scared that they are going to have the same reactions but I want to join a support group where I can meet others in similar situations but I will tell my friends I just got to get the courage too 




 At least you told your friends which I have to starting doing. 




 You should tell a professional, I haven't told my friends but I will soon because its important to have support group. It wasn't a easy thing to do, but now I know that i have it i feel a little bit better 




 CORRECT!  




 Walk to remember 




 Young-adult movie where the main male character makes a bet with his step sister who he has lots of sexual tension with and tries to sleep with this girl, but he ends up following in love with her. GUESS the movie! 




 Emma Stone- Oliver Penderghast in Easy A
Tiffany Maxwell and Pat in Sliver Linings Playbook
 




 I think Matthew won also because he has been known for his romantic stupid movies and he reinvented his career. He has been doing dramas recently and this is the first one that caught our eye and the academys 




 American Hustle 




 I would make the presenters be more entertaining, some of them are great but some are boring.   
























 So there is a song called I want to get better by the Bleachers-Jack Antonoff side band he's also in the band fun. It's a song that I can relate too 




 My favourite performance of hers is probably Veronica Mars. Second is House of Lies. Her character is the only reason why I watch the show.   




 So why is it that you always play characters that always get in the way of the shows main love interest. For example you play Noel in Felicity who was in the way of Felicity and Ben and now in Scandal with Olivia and Fitz.  




 Glad to hear!!  




 Talk to your doctor. If you have been feeling this way for a while it could be. I have been feeling really down and I knew I wasn't my usual self since November then a few weeks after in Nov my sister told me she was engaged I didn't feel anything and thats when I knew I needed to speak to someone.  




 Tell someone about what you went through 




 In all honesty when I think about the future me, I can't picture myself getting old. Keep your head up high kid you're only 18, you can do it 




 I have depression, the illness makes me feel empty, I used to enjoy skiing and other activities but I have lost interest in some activities that I used to love doing and everything just feels grey to me. The illness makes me feel alone because not many 21 have depression thats why I hid it with a smile. I don't know if I answered the 3rd q right but it made me open up more about my depression an what i've been feeling inside.  




 We all wish we were something else. I wish I didn't have depression, but I can't do anything about that prevent it from happening because it already did. My point is, I don't know what you're going through fully but I have two good friends that are gay males and whenever someone saids ''Ugh thats so gay'' I want to slap the person because there is NOTHING wrong with being gay. The internet can be a cruel place for anyone. Unfornately, there isn't much you can do to decrease the negative comments but there is a great quote from 50/50 the movie "You can't change your situation, the only thing you can change is how you deal with it''. There always going to be people that have to bring people down, but you just have to tune them out. As long as you are happy that all it matters. Who really cares what a stranger thinks, because the last time I checked their opinion is irrelevant.  




 The characters, the storyline, the directing (won't be a good movie if the camera is very shaky etc) and most of all the script. If the script is shit most likely it will be a shit movie  




 He needs help, there is nothing wrong with that, but people are afraid of being looked differently or don't think they need help. It's really up to the individual themselves. It took me a few months to finally get help from social worker and the doctor. The move is not easy, trust me but once I did it I feel a lot better and I'm more open about my depression now. Ask him maybe how's he feeling or how are you. I mean this is a tricky question because everyone is different. I would definetly try to push him into talking to a social worker but that's definelty not a easy thing to do. Good luck!   




 I think about this on a constant basis. Everyone thinks about their funeral, but if you think about this often and when your alone it could be because you're  depressed. Don't worry you are not alone. I think and picture my death right in front my eyes. I picture people's reactions on Facebook and who would show up at my funeral and what would they say. You are definitely not alone. Find something that you can distract yourself the second you have those thoughts. For me, once they appear I try to shrug them off.  




 I agree, laughing helps. No one would think I have depression because I'm always laughing but that is what helps me distract myself. Yes it only for a few seconds but those few seconds help

 She should speak to a professional. Is there something that you and her share? Like old memories that you shared together in the past you should bring it back. Maybe you and her did something in the past that you guys stopped doing like going to a certain resturant or a certain area and maybe bring it back?  




 Watching Movies/TV is a good hobby. I find it a great way to distract me from my problems and stress. There are a bunch of good movies/tv shows that are out there. If you need any suggestions let me know  




 What gets me out of bed which sometimes takes me while like an hour. But every week I have one thing to get me through the week. Could be something simple or something special that you don't do much. For me, I love movies/tv is really the only thing that keeps me going. I have a few shows to look forward to for each week. Have something like maybe a bubble bath or something that you don't always do or something special that will get you up and also look forward for the week.

 Last year there was two movies with the exact same plot but different names/characters about the White House in danger. It always happens 




 Sounds like a good plan  




 To be honest I probably would.  




 They don't need to make them period  




 Iron Man 2 was the weakest and most disappointing out of the 3 movies. I would of given Iron man a 60% because Ironman 3 was so much better than the second one. Ironman 3 has a 78% while Ironman 2 has a 73% so there is only a 5% difference between the two films. I would bring Iron man 2 down because it wasn't great. I think Iron Man 3 should be higher up.  




 So what I loved about Frozen is it was different from the previous movies. There was no prince charming and no princess live happily ever after with a minus bump on the way. It was about two sisters which was nice to see. I think the music made the movie even better because the songs are so well written and so catchy. It's a no brainer that Frozen won 2 oscars for best animated and best song.  




 I like superhero movies, but I hate how Fantastic Four is getting a reboot. The movie isn't that old, its unnecessary reboot.  




 Thank you I appreciate it  




 I know it may sound crazy, but I think about how my family will react to my death and how people will react on Facebook and how people will be crying at my funeral being all shocked because no one would expect me to be depressed because im always ''happy'' all the time. I picture my funeral and I'm not even 21 yet.

 I started to be a big fan of his work when Sliver Linings Playbook came out. I liked his other film the Fighter as well. American Hustle was an okay film, a lot of hype unfortunately the movie did not live up to it  




 This will be terrible

 I told my doctor. This only happened once, I was really scared. She moved me up to 1 and half which I think is 15mg.  




 i liked how the movie told Olives point of view plus there was a lot of funny moments in the movie that i loved and after watching the movie  i wanted to see it again

 So it's going to be three weeks this week I believe that I've been taking cipralex to help with my anxiety and depression. My doctor told me it takes about three weeks for the meds to work. Today my suicidal tendencys/thoughts have increased to the point where I was tempted to put my hands on my neck which I did but I stopped myself then I saw a cord and I visualized the wire wrapped around my neck. I know it sounds really crazy, but is it normal for meds to increase the thoughts because I was told after 3 weeks I would notice a change    
























 Anne Hathaway and Mark Wahlberg were originally the leads of Sliver Linings Playbook  




 This would backfire because I don't think people would always see the opening night because spending for example $100 for a movie is a lot of money. As a movie lover, I would just wait till the price lowers down or just watch it online. Indie movies, it would be great for because I think people would start watching Indie movies more.  




 ''I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.''- Taken  




 So my friend is in another country coming home, everyone is so surprised because no one expected this to happen. In honest opinion, I'm very overwhelmed because I know someone else who's father just passed away and also my dad is sick with cancer for a few years and I'm scared he'll be next. 

Question: Has anyone been in this situation and what advice would you give me to help her out?  




 See! This is why I love movies! I'm always tempted with sucidial thoughts but I always have a movie that I want to see. So it keeps me want to wait to watch the movie 




 "Can people with hearing loss drive?" A person asked this in this class we had to take to get our license quicker and she knew I had a hearing loss.   




 It seems like you have changed a few things to be with her. She needs to do the same or it won't work. If you are watching the movie not her, she can't control everything. She seems too controlling  




 Ew, she's dating someone who's in high school. Shows that she is immature. you deserve better

 If he really cared about you, he wouldn't of left. He wouldn't want to leave because he would want to be there for you.  




 Life sucks. I know exactly what you are going through. Every single day I think about death and how much easier it will be if I died. But then I realized I'm only 20 years old. My life is shitty, but I can do something about it. I laugh about my life it helps me and I like making others laugh. You are 16 years old, I know you think ending your life will be better but it won't. Your parents may not understand your depression but they will be heart broken to hear that you ended your life. Why don't you go to a support group and meet new friend that you can relate to? Don't give up my friend.  




 I'm sorry for the PM that you have been receiving. You are not a bad person. Feelings change thats understandable that you want to leave him because also he is being very controlling. Being with someone who has been charged for domestic violence charge is very dangerous. If I were you, I would protect yourself because you are very vulerable in this situation. He is very dangerous and he wants you to feel guilty by saying he is going to commit suicide. Maybe he has a mental illness that you are not aware of that triggered the violence etc. 




 Have a performance that shows many scenes where the character has a emotional breakdown, character development and etc. Worked for Cate Blanchett in Blue Jasmine and Jennifer Lawrence in Sliver Linings Playbook.

 So I wanted to know if there is anything like strategies that they used that has helped decrease the suicidal thought or when they have them what do they do to help get rid of them in a way thats positive? These thoughts I have go in and out of my head, I just want to know if anyone has any strategies that helps them that they would like to share that would be greatly appreciated.  




 I don't know what to say, I'm struggling the same thing to be honest. How am I supposed to help where I can't help myself. I learned that life does suck but its how you deal with the situation it can make life better. Losing a puppy is like loosing your best friend. I can't tell you what that experience is like because I haven't experienced it yet. Being heart broken sucks, but it will get you closer to finding someone who will feel the same way about you. Sometimes we all think we don't have people who care about themselves, but we are wrong. There is people out there who care about you could be your parents, friends, teacher, neighbours, here on reddit. There is someone there for you. I know the feeling of the thought of dying would just make everything eaiser, and trust me I would but knowing that I'm so young and my family would be heart broken kills me inside. Show the girl that she is missing out by doing things you never thought you would do. We all have our moments when we will weak, but it is up to us to steer back into the right directon. Don't give up kid! You can do it.  




 I'm on cipralex for about probably two months now. The beginning you'll notice that you may not be as alert as you used to be that was a side effect for me. I felt very tired at the beginning but then your body will adjust. The medication will not work right away it will take 3 weeks. I was very scared during the 3 week time because my sucidial thoughts increased to the point where I was picturing wires wrapped around my neck. But my doctor increase my dosage and I'm fine so far. Stress can increase your behaviours so try to find coping mechanisms to help you out.  




 I guess they aren't a fan of Easy A then LOL 




 I am Sam, Hotel Rwanda, The Boy In Stripped Pyjamas

 Somebody clearly spent a lot of time on this. But this is very interesting 




 I'm hearing impaired, I'm so grateful that I'm able to use my hearing aids. I'm so happy that you re able to experience this. :) 




 There is nothing wrong with talking to someone who is a professional. The feeling will get worse if you keep it inside and you are not getting the help you need. We all need help in different ways. I just got help I don't regret it for a second.  




 Go to the park, and listen to the birds. Go downtown and hear all the buses and cars youll be amazed to hear all these noises 




 If you want to have a relationship with someone you need to be honest with them  




 Just be honest with her and be like the comment you said really bothered me. No one wants to be called disgusting. One day someone told me I look like a bag of shit. Still to this day it bugs me. Comments like that hurt.  




 Like it or not you need to tell him how you feel. Either way he is going to get hurt. No one likes to get dumped especially if he thinks the relationship is going so well that he wants to propose. What would you rather dump him before between you and him or in front of his family while you reject his proposal. If you say yes because you feel gulity thats even worse giving him false hope. Just be honest with him and make time to do it. There is always time you just have to make it  




 Come on, seriously calling someone a cunt its low.

 Pocketful of Sunshine, I heard that song in the movie Easy A. That movie was shown right when my dad first diagnosed to cancer and the song cheered me up  




 Okay I would love to be Veronica Mars. I don't know if it counts, but it went from a TV series to a movie. She's intelligent plus she got like four boyfriends where I can't get shit.  




 Agreed!  




 You can get fired and you are an intern, he's a full time staff member. He can get you fired in a heart beat, all he needs to do is just tell one person and boom basically you put your job in someone elses hand. I'm not trying to scare you but you put yourself in a very bad situation.  




 I have a question because you are an intern and he's a worker isn't that against the code of ethics or something that you are not supposed to be in intimate relationships with staff members. Just be careful because you might of put your intern in jeopardy because you deleted the texts but it doesn't mean he did.  Also from the look of this it seem like he pressured you and made you do things that you said many times no. That is not right, he took your rights away.  Saying sorry during the sexual act or after doesn't make it better. If I were you I would stay away from him.  




 He sounds like an asshole.  




 Loved her in Frozen! Agreed!  




 I saw Pitch Perfect with my friends and two other people in the theatre. It made the experience ten times better because I already saw it a few other times before. I was able to sing and dance because I knew what was happening. It's the best its empty makes the experience better
