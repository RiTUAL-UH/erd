 Lilly reads Melchio's SBB as an attack on your team so it fills your BB gauges. 




 My Darvanshel is 6*, still working on getting SBB (BB is 8/10)

Just sent you a request
 




 I sent you a request.

Currently I'm running either Thief God Zelnite or Guardian Darvanshel

Lvl 88 




 Thanks!  I guess I just wanted to hear that I'd get there eventually.  LoL

Still working on being able to take full advantage of FH and harder Dungeons.  I have decent units, I just need to get them leveled/BB'd/evolved. 









 Added you. IGN: Jaird

Thanks for the opportunity! 




 At some point does the Zel become easier to accumulate or do you just run out of units to fuse/evolve?

I have what I need to cover necessities but I'm almost ready to evolve my Zelnite and Darvanshel which will leave me basically broke again.  




 Oh, ok.

I don't have either of them, so that explains that. 




 What are the Bulbs used for?

I can't find any info 




 Thanks. I think I have enough other units to cover what I need so I won't be holding on to my duplicates. 

I could use the space anyhow.  




 I cashed in a bunch of gems trying to go for Darvanshel (Good news is I got him) and I ended up with some duplicate units.

Is it worth it to keep multiple copies of units or should I just feed them to their big brothers/sisters for BB points?

Duplicates I have:

Lucina (L) x2

Mariudeth (B)  (L)

Bran (G)  (L)

Ahvel (G), (O),  (L)

Lilly Matah (L) x2 




 Hello, I'm not exactly new to BF but I've kinda been winging it thus far. I need some advice/help putting together a squad. 

Here are my units (in descending rarity order):

6 Star
Wise Mage Elimo
Black Lotus Lunaris

5 Star
Fire God Vargas
Rakshasa Vishra
Axe King Mariudeth
Goddess Hatsune Miku
Goddess Emilia
Bolt Mallet Elulu 
Lightening Sage Bran
Crusher Uda
Cavalryman Sodis
Scythe God Alice
Goth Idol Kikuri
Magistra Lira
Inferno Queen Elza

4 Star
Great Thief Zelnite
Commander Weiss
Sage Bran
Thunder Beast Ahvel
Lead Engineer Garnan
Bahamut 

I also have a couple 3 stars that may or may not be relevant (I'm not sure)

Who should I be focused on advancing? Do I have what I need to tackle some of the bigger challenges/quests?  

I have attempted the Research Lab once and one or two of the Grand Gaia missions but not recently (before I had and 6 star units for sure).

Thanks in advance for any help you can give. 
 




 #imokaywiththat 









 Seems fairly self explanatory. 

Obviously natural Chicken Porridge isn't shelf stable and they don't have a cooler.

More than I thought. And more than I have resources to develop. Lol 




 Saw your request in game before I saw your message. Hope she helped! 




 Accepted. I have Lilly up for you.  




 Thanks!  Will do.

 Which is the best dungeon for finding Metal Mimics?

Cave of Desires Lvl 1 or 2? 




 Finally got him to drop after 10 tries. 

Good news is I didn't have any errors or significant problems clearing the dungeon. 

Bad news is, it took me 10 tries and I got a Guardian. *sigh*

All were 6 star except Mariudeth who is maxed 5

I alternated between Maxwell, Grah, and Darvanshel friends.  




 I cannot access this sub's wiki (the one linked above)

I keep getting an error: 

you are not allowed to do that
 wiki_disabled.

Can anyone confirm if this is a site error or just a me error? 




 Great review!  I always love reading your analyses.

One small error I noticed though:
Garnan In-Depth Look, third bullet from the bottom, the second sentence should read non-Elza, I believe.

With so many similar sounding units I had to take a moment and research whether there was an Erza that I didn't know about  :)

 




 Ok, thanks for that.  Losing access to them in 5 days was definitely going to impact my strategy lol

Specifically, does Turbo Hydraloid need to be level 80 to evolve Tridon to 6*? 




 Thanks!

I'll let you know.  




 Hi,

I sent you a request.  I run Zelnite almost always and I need your Lilly for taking on Maxwell.

IGN: Jaird 




 - **IGN+ID:**  Jaird 8199519575

- **Account Level:**  130
   
- **Leaders:**  Zelnite, Ultor (for arena)
   
- **Looking for:**  Tyrant Lillly Matah friends for Maxwell runs
   
- **Active:**  Daily 




 I'm trying to put together a squad for Maxwell:

I have Zelnite and Darvanshel fully maxed and sphere frogged 

I also have a maxed Tree and Grah

I'm planning on taking a Lilly Matah friend (after I find one, looking for friend thread, I know)

For my last spot I was thinking of training up the Rowgen I just pulled, will he work or should I be looking for someone else?

Also, what kind of spheres should I be using?  I have all the GGC ones (except Black Lance), one Medulla, 2 Sol Creators, Evil Shard, Providence Ring, and the Halloween Spheres (both).  

I couldn't make the score for a Legwand last FH. 




 'Ryan? Yeah, he's a pretty chill roommate; only makes me wear pants when his parents are visiting.' 




 I have one. I doubt it'll happen again.  




 Thanks.  I was leaning more towards him anyway.  




 Who would benefit me more for FH?  6* Hogar or 6* Zellha?

I can evolve one this week.

 I caught Goltovah. 

I read somewhere that all mid-bosses are capturable. 

Today in Lucana's I ran into a Burst Frog and Thunder Crystal mid-boss. Of course I caught the crystal.  




 Accepted. Happy Hunting! 




 Awesome!! 
























 You made a commitment and you're honoring that commitment. There's nothing wrong with having loyalty but you need to be picky about who gets your loyalty. 

I understand you wanting to give him the chance to work things out but it doesn't sound like he's in a place to do that right now. 

You can't put forth all the effort. If your marriage is going to work you both have to work at it and it doesn't sound like he's willing to do that. 

Ultimately you have to decide what's best for you but after how abusive he's been lately I wouldn't give him another chance. There is never and excuse for that.  




 Just let it go. 

General advice: you need to let the other person know when you're leaving. Sneaking out without saying anything is not cool. 

That being said, hook ups are not for everyone. You should sit down and think about how this made you feel and decide if it's something you would do again. 

Personally I can't do hook ups, I need to be in a relationship to feel good about the sex. Everyone is different though and you need to decide for yourself.  




 I love it.

It's my favorite thing to do in bed. 

My wife asked me once how I'm so good at it. Answer: Enthusiasm!

I'm going to echo what one commenter said though about one con. Sometimes you get squeezed when she's close to finishing and it's hard to move/breathe. 

Of course, that's a little bit of a pro as well. :) 




 You told him beforehand there was going to be no helping (read, sexual activity) going on and then when he started anyway you told him no. 

Yes, he raped you. 

Just because it wasn't violent doesn't mean it wasn't rape. 

This guy obviously has no respect for boundaries. 

You need to stay away from him.

Also, please consider seeking some therapy for your experience. 




 I understand that feeling. 

I would love to know what my STBX is thinking/feeling. 

But when I can be honest with myself I realize it doesn't matter and knowing wouldn't make me feel better. 

Look at the possibilities:  either she isn't upset by the end of our marriage which makes me feel like crap or she is upset and then I feel like a different kind of crap wondering why we're going through this at all. 

The reality is that he probably is upset and does miss you but that doesn't make the reason for ending the marriage any less valid.  You guys have history and it's natural to miss that and be scared of what the future may bring. 

But, you can make it.  




 I'm going to agree with everyone else and say you definitely need a lawyer. 

Get in touch with the VA (since you're EOSing) and see what legal options they have available. 

My local VA works with 2 different law groups that offer free counsel to veterans. 

Additionally you need to start thinking about what you want after the divorce in terms of property and custody. Decide what things you want to keep and how much involvement you want with your kids. 

Knowing what you want will make it harder for you to be talked into something you're ultimately uncomfortable with.  




 You don't mention what the fertility issue is (and you don't have to) but his feelings may stem from that. 

He may be feeling like a failure and less of a man because he couldn't impregnate you. This could be causing some minor (or major) depression. 

Additionally, even though you guys have decided to stop actively trying he may still be feeling pressure to make something happen. 

He also could be feeling disappointed that there is no baby coming. I know it's the stereotype that men don't get excited about babies (or the prospect of babies) but that's not always the case. I'm speaking from personal experience here. 

Whatever the problem is, your best course of action is to talk to him. If he won't go into detail on his own, ask him questions (you can start with the possibilities I've stated) and see where that gets you. 

Above all, be supportive and don't make statements like 'you're a man, you're supposed to want it all the time'

Again, from personal experience, that helps nothing.  




 I am going through a divorce (yay, fun times) and while I don't think I'll be ready for another relationship for some time I do have some concerns about being back on the market. 

I have been with my wife for 11 years. Before her I only had 3 sexual partners. One was a one night stand, one was just oral, and the other was not at all healthy. So, I've learned and experienced basically all of my sex with one person. 

I am confident that I know what I'm doing with her. Our sex life is not the reason for the split. 

I'm a little worried about how my skills will transfer though. I know everyone is different and I worry that I may be stuck in habits that won't work with another woman. How much importance do you place on a first time with a new partner?  If it's not amazing are you likely to decide to move on?

Also, I question how my comparative lack of experience will come across. Ladies, do you find it a turn off that a man has had few partners? 




 When my parents divorced (I was 26) my father stopped communicating with me and all my sisters. 

I was (understandably, I think) hurt by this and I tried to repair the relationship years later but all the effort was on my part so that inevitably failed. 

I realized, though, that the relationship I had previously with my father was always guided by my mother.

Given your close relationship with your father I wouldn't expect you to suffer the same but you should realize that your relationship will be different, with both of your parents. 

Lean on your husband and sister for support and be there for your mom and dad as much as you can (without getting caught in the middle). As you've noticed, even with agreement, divorce is hard. 

They're going to have a tough time with it and you and your sister are as well. But, if you can all be there for each other then you'll all come through it ok.  




 I know how you feel. 

My wife (of 9 years) wants out and all I want is to be able to fix things and have my best friend and partner back. 

What's helped me feel (a tiny bit) better is being able to reflect clearly on our past and realize that she's never really been the partner I wanted/needed. 

I don't know if that's the case for you or not but I totally understand your feelings about wishing things could go back.  




 Thankfully I was able to realize that I was in a bad place and get help. 

My sister has been awesome helping me through this. 

I'm still working on forgiving myself for marrying someone who isn't nice.  I can mostly admit now that the way she treats me isn't healthy or acceptable and that it's not my fault.

Sometimes I can think that things will work out better for me after we're done. Sometimes, though, I get stuck thinking about what I could have done to fix things between us. 

I can't help feeling like a failure. 

It's ironic because neither of our respective parents are still married but I actually thought that we could make it.  




 I have been seeing a therapist which I think is helping a little. 

Fact is, I  was feeling really depressed and wanting to kill myself. I spent basically all of Feb in the hospital trying to feel better. 

And while I was there she called me once and never came to visit. I got to see my kids once because my sister was able to bring them to me. 

My wife told me after I was admitted that she couldn't support me. 

The fucked up part is that even after everything that's happened and how shitty she's treating me I still love her. 

I miss her and want to talk to her and be able to touch her again. 

And every time she texts me, even though I know it's just going to be something about bills or the kids' schedules, I get a little thrill. I'm still excited to hear from her even though she's stopped wearing her rings and she 'has no responsibility towards me as a wife anymore' (that's a direct quote). 




 This will be long, sorry in advance. 

My wife told me shortly after the new year that she wanted a divorce. In her opinion we are too different to ever work out and she doesn't want to waste her time working on a relationship that's destined to fail.

At the same time (earlier that day even) I found a text conversation between her and a coworker that bordered on inappropriate and definitely made me feel uncomfortable and jealous. 

About a week later after multiple conversations and arguments (and not a little bit of crying on my part) I found another conversation between them that was way more explicit and totally inappropriate. Basically they were talking about how they could wait to fuck when they had the chance. 

She hasn't really given me any real reasons for wanting a divorce, just want seems like excuses: We're too different, we don't like the same things, she found herself attracted to this other guy. 

Supposedly nothing physical happened between them. 

I just feel like every 'reason' she's given me could be worked on between us (through therapy as well) but she has no interest. 

I've been feeling really depressed about my whole life and trying to find ways past this. 

I've finally accepted that's there's nothing I can say/do to change her mind. 

We've been sleeping separately for a couple weeks now and I just feel so lonely. 

Some details people will probably ask:

We have 2 kids; 5 and 8
We've been married 9 years (anniversary in Dec), together for 11
Nothing has been filed yet, I have retained a lawyer 




 For the Earth Arena coming up I have:

Zelnite x2
Dilma
Ophelia

For my last spot, should I use Miku or Douglas?  I've heard Douglas is bad but he's 6* and she's only 5* 




 Yes 
























 I have some hobbies, things that I used to think that I liked to do. 

But I've come to realize that all of those things are really just distractions. I do them and I can't forget about feeling like shit for a little while. 

I don't derive any happiness from the act of doing those things.  




 I've have bouts of depression since I was a teenager (I'm 33)

I've only recently recognized that I have depression (after hospitalization because I wanted to kill myself) but looking back I've had it basically forever. 

I started taking medication 3 months ago and I feel better. But only just. I'm not great, I'm not happy.  I'm 'ok'.

I don't even remember a time when I was happy. 

What's the point if I'm only going to be 'ok' for the rest of my life? 




 ^ This

I'm running his build and it is sweet 




 This is a huge change for both of you. It's totally natural to be stressed about it. 

I think you'd be more excited if you guys had been together for a bit and he was coming back from a trip or extended stay somewhere.  But, as you said, you guys don't have that experience yet. You don't know that it's something to look forward to. 

The thing is, it IS something to look forward to.

It's going to be stressful and you're going to argue and you're going to have bad days but you're both going to be with the one that you love and get to see them everyday. It's not going to be super happy times every minute but you guys can make it work if you want it (and I think it's obvious that you both want it). 

You don't have to lay all your stress on him now but I'd suggest that you make sure to communicate when he's there with you. That's the key to keeping things smooth.  




 I used the one for the 360 and loved it. 

I hadn't realized that they came out with one for the One. 

That's getting shipped to me immediately.  




 Just because he doesn't have a plan for the future doesn't necessarily mean he doesn't want you as a part of his future. Some people just aren't planners. 

You should talk to him and ask where he sees you guys going in the relationship. Does he even want to get married?  You don't need to give him an ultimatum but you need to tell him that you need this conversation to happen even if it makes him uncomfortable. 

You have a right to know what his plans are for the future of your relationship. Or, if he doesn't have specific plans, just a general sense of where he wants it to go. 

Does he want to get married? Does he want to get married but not right now? Does he just want to date you long term?

And then, you need to decide, based on his answers, if that's acceptable to you. Would you be ok staying with him knowing he wants to get married, just not immediately? Would you be ok if he never wanted to marry but still wanted a family with you?

Good luck, I hope everything works out well for you two.  




 I understand you feeling boring because your boyfriend hasn't had a 'first' with you. 

But, you should listen to him when he says that he doesn't think you're boring. That's just your low self-confidence talking. 

Also, the thing is, a lot of times the first time you do something, it isn't that great. 

Instead of being caught up in being his 'first' whatever, you could try focusing on being his best something. Look at his interests and find something that you're into or would like to try. Something that you can really get into and do with him and he can have the best time ever doing it. 

I'm not just talking about sexual things, it could be any interest.

He has chosen you as the girl he wants to be with so believe me, he's already having a great time doing some things with you. Honestly, doing things with someone you like to be around is so much better than doing it by yourself. 

The flip side of this is since he is more experienced, think of all the first that you can have. Even if he has done it before, you haven't and that makes it special. 

I would also suggest to him to stop telling you that he's done things before and if you're asking him, stop that. 

It doesn't help your confidence and it also doesn't matter.

So what if it isn't your first slice of pizza, does that make it any less delicious?  I say no.  




 Of course you have a right to be jealous, you always have a right to your feelings. 

What you need to ask yourself is if you think the jealousy is coming from a place of truth or just a feeling you're having. What I mean is, are you jealous because you think your boyfriend is thinking about/planning/already doing something inappropriate or are you jealous just because he's talking to pretty girls.

From your post I think it may be the latter. 

That being said you need to talk to him further about this. Tell him that you are feeling uncomfortable that he only talks to pretty girls and you'd like it if he talked to you more (in French). 

I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for his practice time to be split between you and his Skype conversations. 

Maybe suggest that he have a Skype conversation with you if in person is too intimidating right now. 

I would like to add that I am inclined to believe that his preference for talking to French-speaking girls is probably innocent. My guess is that he feels more relaxed speaking with them than men or older people and so he's able to get better practice.  




 Or you could find a book and order it online. 

I enjoy going to bookstores which is why that was my first thought. 

I think it's really great that you're trying to make things better instead of just letting things go on the same way. 

And your fianc sounds like he really supports you which is AWESOME. 

It sounds like you have a great relationship and I wish you guys nothing but happiness and orgasms.  




 I think #1 you need to talk to your fianc about these things. 

Let him know that you get distracted and that you want to not be distracted. Maybe you guys can come up with a solution together. 

You could try setting a time limit like you're only going to touch each other for 5 minutes and then you take a break. It will add a component of anticipation to your play. 

Additionally, the research that you are doing into more interesting things, I'm going to suggest that you involve your fianc. Ask him look at what you're looking at. Go to a book store and pick out a book that you guys can read together. You guys can discuss things that look fun to both of you that you want to try (now and later). 

And you could incorporate those fantasies into your current play. Find a position or act that turns you on and then you guys can talk about it in bed. Thinking about that could keep you in the moment.  




 I should say, in no way do I think he is deserving of anyone's time. 

However, I can't make that decision for her which is what I was trying to say. 

My wife cheated on me and I would never consider reconciliation with her but not everyone feels the same as I (or you) do. 

I know two different couples who have moved past infidelity and are still together but I don't know that I could ever do that.  




 You can't get stuck on the what ifs. 

All you can do is look forward.  I think it's good that you have your own place away from him. You need time to think on things and what you want to do going forward and it will be easier if you're not around him. 

You need to figure out what YOU want to do. Not what he wants or what his mom or friends want. Not what your family wants, what YOU want.  You're the only one who can make this decision and that's the way it should be because you're the one who has to live with it. 

I understand things are shitty now. I totally get what you're saying about your chaotic emotions. 

I'm going through a divorce right now and in many ways I'm in the same place. 

But things will get better. I'm not saying you'll feel better about what he did but you will find a way to move past it, either with him or without. 

 




 As you stated having learned from this sub, communication is key!

You did what you could to keep the lines of communication open. Asking about new things he wanted to try, making time in your (understandably) busy schedule to be with him and have sex, etc. 

The thing is, he didn't do everything that HE could. 

I can totally understand you feeling like a failure because of what he has done but what you need to remember and what you will believe in time is that it is not your fault. At all. 

This is his failing. He had insecurities, as we all do, but instead of dealing with them maturely with a therapist or by discussing them with you, he sought sex from strangers. 

He probably is sorry and his willingness to open himself and his movements to you speaks to his regret. 

What you need to decide is if you think you'd ever be able to trust him again. 

If you decide to continue the relationship you guys definitely need therapy together. You need to figure out how to move past this and you need to learn how to communicate with each other. 

But, if you don't want to continue the relationship then no one can fault you for that decision. And making that decision doesn't indicate failure on your part. 

I repeat, this is his failure. 

Good luck.  




 You are definitely not wrong to want to be in touch with your sexuality. 

It is as much a part of you as your eyes or fingers. 

I am not a religious person at all but humans are sexual creatures, we have to be or none of us would be here. It's how we reproduce!  I don't see why there's any reason you can't be comfortable with who you are both sexually and spiritually. 

What you need to do is find people who you can talk to about things in a positive way. Maybe a therapist or your school counselor. Also, your friend that you mentioned (the veteran) might be a good choice since you've already spoken with him about your history and he's been supportive. 

Whatever you do, know that there is nothing wrong with wanting or enjoying sex. There's nothing wrong with you, no matter what your family/culture are telling you. 

Good luck!
 




 So I found a note book my wife is writing to her boyfriend or lover or whatever he is. 

Apparently it's his birthday today and she's been trying to come up with something special to do for him and her idea is to write down song lyrics that remind her of him and 'bring him closer to her heart'

Here's the irony: the last song she's written in the book (so far) is I Won't Give Up by Jason Mraz. She's writing to him a song about not giving up on someone at the same time that she's cheating on her husband. Here's the lyrics if you've never heard the song:

When I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
Well, there's so much they hold
And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

Well, I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

'Cause even the stars they burn
Some even fall to the earth
We've got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up

I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use
The tools and gifts we got, yeah, we got a lot at stake
And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I've got, and what I'm not, and who I am

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up, I'm still looking up.

Well, I won't give up on us (no I'm not giving up)
God knows I'm tough enough (I am tough, I am loved)
We've got a lot to learn (we're alive, we are loved)
God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it)

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up 
























 You boyfriend needs to understand that sexting is pretty normal nowadays. Unless you're Amish of course. 

Also, just because you send pictures to someone doesn't mean that you're 'asking for it' which I feel like is basically what he was saying. 

I think the issue of you forgiving yourself has to do with your first sexual experience.  I don't know if this has occurred to you but you were raped. 

You didn't want it, you said so out loud, but he did it anyway. Just because you didn't physically try to stop him and just because he was your boyfriend doesn't negate the fact that someone had sex with you against your will. 

I think you need to seek out counseling to deal with that trauma and I think you need to explain to your boyfriend that you need his support in this.  




 By all means, text him.

I guarantee there is cell service in Vegas so no communication from him is not acceptable. Let him know that you are unhappy with him for the silence and he should at least be checking in with you at the bare minimum once per day. 

When he returns you can have a longer conversation with him about what the trip was like and find a way to move past any uncomfortableness you have with things. 

For now, try not to yell or scold him, just let him know you expect to hear from him.  




 Yes absolutely take his offer. 

It would be one thing if she was just someone he dated or hooked up with while you guys were broken up but given her history and the fact that she's still trying to sleep with him even after he made it clear he's not into that (since he's back with you) she has to go.

Honestly if I were him I would cut her out anyway regardless of what you said. She is dangerous to your relationship and disrespectful towards you as well. 

As for dealing with the jealousy you're just going to have to talk to him. Ask him to be honest with you about what happened between them and ask all the questions you need answers to. And going forward tell him you need to know anytime she tries to contact him, even if it seems innocent at the time. 

And if he's comfortable with it, ask for open access to his phone. Just know that if he says no to that request it shouldn't be a deal breaker.  You are both still allowed privacy. 

Do your best not to obsess over it. You guys are back together and he's serious about it. Just look at what he told her when she contacted him.  Trust him, it seems like he's doing the right thing.  




 Start making plans just for you. 

Tell him 'Tomorrow morning I am doing 'this' if you want to come let me know'

In your head, plan on going alone to do whatever it is. 

You've indicated that you're ok with small changes so if he decides to go then that should be fine. But at least this way you have a plan and you follow through. 

Additionally you should tell him why you're changing your SOP. Let him know that his avoidance of committing (either yes or no) is draining and you aren't going to be relying on him for that anymore.  




 Your parents were fucked up when you were growing up and did a horrible job parenting you. 

That is not your fault. 

It's good for your sister's sake that they've improved but I guarantee that their improvement had nothing to do with her. Just like their complete lack of responsibility had nothing to do with you. 

Their actions are not any value judgement on you or your worth. 

It's natural to feel the way you do I think. You've been traumatized and you're having to deal with it. 

For your boyfriend I would suggest finding some good reading materials on supporting people with depression. A quick google search of that phrase finds a few good articles and there's probably some more in depth literature available. 

For you, just make it clear to him that the way you're feeling isn't because of him. He is not causing your depression. He also can't fix it. What he can do is be there for you (ways for him to do that are why he needs to read up on the subject). 

As others have said, you need to seek out counseling. I know it's difficult. Hopefully the idea of insurance through your school pans out because you need some help to deal with what you're going through. 

I know there are a lot of people here who are willing to talk (like me) but I feel safe saying that most of us are not trained professionals.  




 You lied to him for a period of time and that was fucked up. 

But the only thing you owe to him for that is an apology and the truth which you've already given. 

You don't owe him a relationship, you don't owe him surgery. 

If he really wanted to be your friend or have a relationship with you he would try and forgive you and move on. Instead he's holding it over your head by saying you 'owe' him something. 

You need to cut ties with him. He is a selfish person and not interested at all in what is best for you.  




 I wish I had something super helpful to say but I think a lot of it has been covered already (therapy). 

I can say that you and your wife don't need to worry about your son's potty training. 

I have 2 daughters and my first daughter potty trained in about a week (minus overnights) at 2 years old. My younger daughter didn't finish until she was 4. It's totally an individual thing and also has to do with how uncomfortable they are sitting in soiled clothes. 

My younger daughter has no issue sitting and continuing play in her wet pants so it took awhile to get things to stick.  




 What's killing me is that what I'm going through doesn't feel normal.

My wife doesn't give a shit about me anymore, she's not going through one of the toughest times in her life, she's already moved on. 

And the fact that she can drop me this easily makes me feel absolutely worthless and doesn't really inspire any kind of confidence for my future. 

I know even if I could meet someone right away that jumping into another relationship is a bad idea I just wish I had some hope that I could find one sometime in the future.  




 You say you have a successful career so tell her you're seeking therapy to better deal with job related stress. 

I don't know any job that doesn't involve stress and generally the more successful one is, the more stress there is to deal with. 

I understand you not wanting to hurt your wife and if you feel like you can't be honest then joint therapy probably isn't the best idea now. 

I will say that you need to find a way to communicate how you're feeling to your wife. That's something you could work on with a therapist though, I'm sure.  




 I forgot to mention, I'm in therapy and I am currently taking medication. 

At best right now I feel ok. Not great, just ok. 

The past few days I've just felt worse and worse.  




 My wife came to me at the beginning of January saying she wanted a divorce (married 9 years, together for 11).  I wanted to try and work things out but she was not at all interested.  She was convinced that we would never work out and didn't want to 'waste her time' working on a relationship that was destined to fail.

I was already in a depressed state and this did not help things along.  I ended up checking myself into a hospital for most of February.

During that time she did basically everything she could to abandon me.  She never visited, didn't bring our kids to see me, she only called me once.

I found out after I was discharged that she started a relationship with a coworker while I was hospitalized.

Now we barely communicate even though nothing has been finalized.  We are working out a custody agreement but it's not finished and we haven't even discussed dividing assets other than cars.

She's totally moved on with her other guy and I feel more and more lonely every day.

I'm sure that dating someone else right now would be a bad idea anyway but I'm feeling pretty hopeless about my future prospects.

I've never been great at meeting people in general and women in particular and between work and being with my kids I don't know when I'd have time to anyway.  I'm not an incredibly social person.

Plus, I feel like I am a really bad dating prospect.  I'm 33, soon to be divorced, I have 2 kids, suffer from depression, I'm employed at least but by no means am I wealthy, I'm probably about average in the looks department.

I just keep looking into the future and seeing me alone and it's really hard to keep positive about anything right now.

I'm cross posting this to r/Divorce because I don't know how much of this is normal end-of-marriage feelings and how much is my depression talking.

 What you need to do first is figure out where you want your relationship with your wife to go. 

Do you love her? Do you want to stay with her? 

I think loves takes many forms. Maybe you love her most for how she facilitates things for you, that's not inherently wrong. As long as you are fulfilling her needs then your relationship can work. If you want it to. 

If you decide you want to stay with her then therapy is a good idea, for both of you. Tell her that you're happy with things but there's always room for improvement. Talk to her about your goals and her goals. Figure out how to best fulfill her needs. Communicate!

If you don't want to stay with her you need to tell her, and soon after you decide. 

BUT, don't use the attention you're getting or the relationship you have with this other woman influence your decision. Sit down and decide solely on the relationship you have with your wife.  




 Well, without hearing from her we can't be sure of her motivations. 

I choose to believe that during their breakup she realized that she would rather be with him and chose to come back. 

I think if she was really treating him as a 'back up' then there would have been more stringing him along going on. As it stands, when they broke up, they also broke contact. 

Maybe I'm wrong though, maybe the other guy she was dating dumped her and that's why she came back. 

Either way it happened though she still didn't deserve to be cheated on. 

Edit: Also, I can't fault her for breaking up with him when she did. She obviously knew things were headed towards engagement and decided to end things before that happened. If she wasn't sure of the relationship and her commitment to it that was the right thing to do.

It's going to suck either way but I'd rather that happen to me than to actually make a proposal and be shut down. Or, have her say yes because she feels pressured in the moment and not really mean it.  




 You're a giant jerk. Whether you wanted to break up or go on that break doesn't matter. You guys weren't together and she dated someone else. That's life man. 

She eventually realized that you were what she wanted and came back to you. That's awesome. 

And then you go and cheat on her as part of some ill conceived payback?  

If you were still really bothered by her dating someone else while you guys were broken up then you should have sought out couples counseling before now. 

I guarantee that you sleeping with someone else would never be a therapy that someone would suggest. 

Honestly it would be best for her if you guys just went your separate ways, she deserves better than this. 

If she's determined to stay with you then you guys MUST seek out counseling. But your number one priority should be coming to the realization that what you did is wrong and fucked up. 

You need to apologize and do everything she needs for her to feel better about things.  
























 Sexual incompatibility can totally be a relationship killer. 

BUT, you don't have that problem. 

Sexual incompatibility is when you guys aren't having sex as much as you (or he) thinks you should or wants to and that doesn't seem to be the case. 

As long as you guys are both satisfied with your sex life and the relationship it doesn't matter what other people think. You could have sex one per year or 6 times a day and it still wouldn't matter. 

If you think your boyfriend is unhappy or your need reassurance that he is then talk to him. But, from everything that you've written it sounds like you're both on the same page.  




 Obviously you need to talk to him about it. 

Sometimes though, fantasies are just fantasies. Doggy style might just be something he likes thinking about but (evidently) doesn't like doing. 

Less likely (in my mind at least) is the possibility someone else raised that he's doing research to try something new for you. While that would be awesome I feel like it's probably not the case. 

You need to have an in depth conversation with him about why he doesn't like the position. Does it not feel pleasurable? Does he feel like it is degrading to you? Does he feel uncomfortable not being able to see your face?

There is a real reason and you need to suss it out and only then can you possibly work on moving past it. 

Good luck. And remember to be a gentle as possible during the conversation. Use 'I' statements where ever possible (I would like it if we... I like doggy because...) and avoid 'you' statements (You only like it when we... You never want to try new things) because they can sound accusatory and make him defensive.  




 Have your boyfriend sleep on the couch. 

You are a guest in his home, you can be considerate of his wishes when you visit. It's not a complete imposition. 

Is it silly? Yes. Would you and your BF staying in the same room destroy your nephew's faith? No. 

But, it's for a short period of time, I'm sure your relationship with your BF can handle a couple nights not in the same bed and it would make your brother more comfortable. 

Try not to focus on it while you're there and just have a good visit. It's a small thing, you can handle it.  




 You aren't being a bitch, your husband is acting like a child.

If his single mid-late 20's co-workers want to go out every night and get drunk and party at strip clubs that is their choice.  His choice was to get married and have a family and there are responsibilities that go along with that choice.  He needs to start living up to those responsibilities.

First he needs to start communicating with you on when he expects to be home.  That's just basic courtesy.  

Then you guys need to set and agree on some boundaries.  How many nights per week will he go out with his co-workers?  Is it acceptable to visit strip clubs on non-special occasions?  What activities need to be cleared/discussed prior to their occurrence?

If he balks at either request (communication or boundaries) then he needs to consider whether he wants your marriage to work.  For a marriage to work both people have to be committed and present and right now, he is not present (and maybe not committed either).

Either way, something needs to change.  




 * What do people look for in a romantic partner?
That varies from person to person I think but mainly in the details. In general people want someone they are attracted to, someone who finds them attractive, someone they share interests and values, and someone who they enjoy being with. 

* Me sending funny pictures/articles that remind me of them, etc., is that weird? What are normal clear-interest showing examples of things to do when seeing someone?
I'd say that's not weird. Be aware thought that different people are comfortable with different levels of affection/interest at different times. I would say continue to be yourself and you will find someone who appreciates what you have to offer. 

* What is the fundamental or "core" of a relationship?
For me, attraction and trust. 

* How much interest is too much/too little? 
There's no hard rule. Some guys (and gals) are going to accept/expect higher levels sooner than others. Find the level you are comfortable with and express that and if you aren't getting what you expect back then say so. 

* How to not be vapid without having to be a ball of energy at the time?
You don't have to be constantly excited about everything but I find it very attractive when women are passionate about something. Have something in your life that you care deeply about and be open to new experiences. That's all anyone can ask of you. 

Edit:Hit submit by accident 
 




 Your boyfriend is not perfect. 

It's great that he's been there for you through your illness/diagnosis but I guarantee he is/has been feeling stressed by the whole thing. 

If you believe his apology to be sincere then accept it. 

It's hard to the other person watching someone you love suffer like that and have nothing you can do to fix it. Especially for guys because we like to fix things. 

What he said was not supportive and you definitely have a right to be upset about it. I just wouldn't take it as a sign that he thinks you fake things or are a hypochondriac since he's never given that impression before. 

Let him know you were hurt by his comments, accept his apology and move on. It's ok to be upset (for both of you), just don't let it poison what otherwise sounds like a good relationship.  




 You guys weren't trying to get pregnant and from what you wrote it doesn't sound like you even knew you were pregnant until after the miscarriage. 

That must have been a shock and I'm really sorry you had to go through that at all and especially without support from your boyfriend. 

My wife and I have been through 5 miscarriages in many stages from 1 week to 12 weeks. It's a little different for you because you didn't know you were pregnant at the time but let me say that men and women process pregnancy very differently. 

It's hard for men to conceptualize babies in the womb. For a lot of men it's even hard to get attached emotionally to babies until they are able to have actual interaction of some kind (what level of interaction that triggers an emotional response varies from man to man I have found). 

All of that is to say that your boyfriend might be experiencing a lot of different emotions that he doesn't know how to process and that those emotions are probably very different from what you experienced/are experiencing. 

Don't assume you can read his mind/know how he's feeling without hearing it from him. 

I suggest you sit down and have a serious conversation with him about how the miscarriage made you feel and how you felt unsupported by his actions. Let him know the kind of support you would have liked at the time and what you would like going forward. Ask him how he is feeling and encourage him to actually discuss his feeling and not just brush them off. 

If you come to find that it's not a wave of unprocessed emotions that are making him act like an unsupportive jerk and he just is a jerk then by all means end things. 

Just don't assume you know what he's thinking or feeling ahead of time. 

Just because he's a guy doesn't mean he's automatically an unfeeling caveman. He still might be that but it's not a default setting we all share.  




 1 Find a divorce lawyer, in case you want to go that route, knowing steps to take ahead of time is never a bad idea. 

2 Find a therapist. While the internet is always here for venting, talking to a professional is more beneficial 

3 Talk to your husband. Tell him you know about the affair. Be prepared for him not to admit to everything at once. This is not acceptable but it is bound to happen anyway. Find out if he wants to save the marriage. Be prepared (as much as you can be) that his answer may be no. 

If he says yes, he needs to cut contact with her NOW. Not tomorrow, not ASAP, NOW. If he wants to save the marriage he doesn't owe her a face to face, he doesn't owe her an explanation. Have him call her, text her, email her in front of you and then no further contact. He also needs to keep you aware of any contact they have going forward. If he runs into her at a restaurant, if she texts him, whatever.

Make it clear that any contact that happens that he doesn't immediately report is a deal breaker for you. There can be no half measures on rebuilding trust. He has to recognize that he broke it so he has to fix it.

You guys also need to see a therapist together to work through the trust rebuild and any other issues that exist or may arise. 

It's not going to be easy. The whole thing sucks and will continue to suck for a long time. 

All of this, of course, is assuming that you want to save the marriage. That is something only you can decide and no one would blame you if you wanted to just be done with him. 

I'm sorry you're going through this. Good luck.  




 Tell your friend that, as he is aware, you are going through a rough time in your marriage and you need to focus on your relationship with your husband. Furthermore, since you crossed a line with him you need to have no more contact with him going forward   

If he is a decent person he will understand and comply. If he isn't, don't take no for an answer. 

Tell your husband when you have the end of contact conversation with your friend and then let him know ANY time you have further contact, no matter who initiates and no matter how small the contact. 

Any hidden conversation  that comes out can totally destroy trust between you and your husband. 

Good luck working through this!  I believe you can do it as long as you both stay focused on each other.  




 If he isn't already he should get hooked up with the local VA center.

As someone else mentioned, there is no time limit on PTSD and honestly (if that is the problem) going longer without treatment will only make things worse. 

And if that isn't the problem there are specialists that can help him diagnose the issue. 

I'm a Marine as well and I know it's tough for people like us to seek out help. 

Just do everything you can to let him know that you love and support him and that you don't think anything less of him, although probably don't mention that last bit unless he asks. 

Be ready with examples of how you don't consider him a failure to say in case he expresses that sentiment.  Tell him you are happy to talk things through and then give him space to decide when/if he wants that conversation to happen. 

I'm sure he's aware already but he's really lucky to have someone so supportive in his life. I wish you both lots of luck and I know you guys can make it through this.  




 I'm sorry you've had such bad experiences. 

I am a 33M just back on the dating scene and if I had started seeing someone and they reacted as you did I would be all for it. 

I think the problem is the guys you've been finding, not you. I know that doesn't make it suck any less but I think the only solution is for you to keep meeting people. 

Be honest with what you're looking for in a relationship (or out of one, depending on your preference) and I'm sure you will find a good fit for you. 

Good luck! 




 You need to bring up counseling again and this time don't take no for an answer. 

Make it clear that even if he doesn't see the problems the same way (ie, not as big a deal) they are a big deal to you and they need to be addressed. 

Don't accept 'I'll do this better' or 'I'll do more of that' because things will go back to the norm. 

I don't think you guys are totally hopeless but you both need to work at it. 

Additionally, I know you don't want to, but you need to cut contact with this other guy. 

As someone else said, it isn't fair for your husband to have to compete with someone you're not having issues with. If you want the marriage to work your focus should be there, not anywhere else.  




 Ok. Thanks for the heads up. 

Guess I'll be unlocking Shores first.  




 I'm on the Xbox. 

I just finished 'Assist the Zhentarim' step of the campaign and have Shores of Tuern and Lair of Lostmauth available (just missing requirements). 

My question: are the unlock costs a one time thing or do I have to pay that every time I want to run them? 




 I play a Cleric, usually on everyday.
