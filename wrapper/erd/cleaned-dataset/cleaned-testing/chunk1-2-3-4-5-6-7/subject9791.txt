 Usually teams would do sales to get rid of their old stocks.

McLaren has the best value for monies currently due to lowest needed for free worldwide shipping

Notes: 

 Williams online shop are still closed

 Marussia don't seem to have one

 Lotus don't seem to care that 2013 was last year

 Red Bull/Toro Rosso's "sale" is not really cheap, especially if you want the free shipping

 No sales for Force India nor Ferrari

 Merc price is quite good, but no free shipping

 It's cheap to use RM to buy in the Caterham shop, but sadly their paypal account won't accept RM for some reason. I had to contact their sales to get my payment through 



















 Got F1 2013 during 75% sale. I am more used to the gMotor2 engine, so this one feels a bit weird

1 - How do I lessen tyre wear? In career mode at China, I noticed that my tyres were wearing out faster than other cars, even tho I was using throttle modulation to make sure there is not tyre spin out of the corners

2 - Why does the car feels like it's understeering? At Spa I am loosing time entering Bruxelles and Pouhon waitng for the front end to grip, even when the AI can just accelerate out from there.

3 - Any wheel setting guide? There is not much feel when the tyre is losing grip

4 - Is it normal that the AI are different from each track? I was winning around 40s at Melbourne and Sepang, but Hamilton was right at my tail in Shanghai no matter what I do or how much I push

 I collected F1 Racing Magazine since 2007. But some were lost as I move a lot. One of the issue that I lost was the October 2008 issue where it had the Italian Grand Prix highlights by Maurice Hamilton. In it Maurice explained how Toro Rosso had been much more clever with the brake choice (choosing a brake that heats up faster in the rain), and if not for Bourdais's stall at the grid could have easily won 1-2 



















 2014 is an interesting time. New rules, and except for Mercedes, other teams are still struggling to understand how all it works. In this time of chaos, many ideas are thrown around trying to find something to "Spice up" the race again. One of this was "raise the fuel limit so they can go flat out from start to finish"

Now this might seem logical at first glance. This season, cars are limited to only 100Kg of fuel (or ~140litres, depending on density). This means that teams are forced to save fuel and can't push as hard as they like. More fuel = less saving = faster racing right?

But what if I said that idea is not accurate? Remember the fuel limit? It's kind of helpful that the FIA uses "100Kg" as it shows that the fuel is actually quite heavy. C'mon, try dragging 100Kg around and tell me it's not heavy. And if you were in any physics classes during your school days, you know that weight does influence things.

First, let us refresh back on what extra weight can do to a race car. Extra weight means that you will have a higher lap time. Also tyre wear would be higher due to the grip needed to fight the momentum of the cars in during cornering. Another thing is braking point is also extended, due to momentum of a heavier car.

There is also the repercussion of driving flat out all the time. It induces unneeded wear on the parts of the car, and also puts strains on the drivers as well. Tyres wears out faster as well due to overheating.

Now let's imagine a race, where one car is given a 200Kg limit and another is given a 100Kg limit. During practice, the car with the 100Kg limit could lap an average 0.4 per lap faster than the one with the 200Kg limit. Just 0.4 per lap. Not much faster. They entered a 50 lap race. The 200Kg limit car is pushing all out, while the 100Kg car is saving fuel. 

Since the 100Kg car is saving fuel, the lap times is now actually similar. There 200Kg car is pushing and pushing. But wait, by lap 12 the 200Kg car needs to pit since the tyre is now toast. The 100Kg car meanwhile eaked out to lap 18 before pitting. A classic case of a 3 stopper vs 2 stopper. But since the lap times are similar this actually means the 200Kg car already have a 20s disadvantage due to an extra stop it has to make

The race goes on and both cars are now lapping faster. But the 200Kg car still needs to make up that extra stop. Having nothing to loose, it keeps pushing full throttle, now lapping a tad faster than the 100Kg car

Final stint, and now sprint to the finish. The 100Kg car is now pushing more due to saving fuel at the start. But since both have now used much of their fuel, the lap times are dropping to a similar level. The 200Kg car is spewing brake dust everytime it's brakes for a corner though. Due to the heavier car, the brakes were working harder and is now nearly finished. Things does not look good in the engine side either. A decision must be made, and the pit called to the 200Kg car, asking him to slow down to save the car. 

The above example might not be accurate, but it does gives an idea that more fuel does not really mean better racing. During the days of yore, teams usually underfuel or use the minimum fuel that they can to have a lighter car that might have to save fuel at the start but could push at the end. Upping the fuel limit it worthless if the teams themselves does not even care

The only way around this in theory is to introduce back refuelling, which would mean the cars could still fuel low, but does not have the danger of running out of fuel. But this does introduce another problem. Cars that are already fast on fixed fuel like Mercedes, could end up going faster than they are.

In the end there are no easy and simple solution for better racing. It's made even harder now that armchair fans are more vocal with ideas that they have no idea about using social media. Nothing is as simple as it seems, especially in the complicated world of Formula Racing 
























 Due to the sad case of the missing flight MH370, where the majority of the passengers were Chinese, some of the Chinese citizen has taken among themselves to blame everything that has happened on the Malaysian Govt.

With Caterham lead by Tony Fernandes that has ties with MAS (Air Asia and MAS swapped some stocks) and Merc is sponsored by Petronas which always proud of it's Malaysian root,they certainly won't be too popular in China during the GP weekend 



















 For me it was an ironic thing of can't affording a console. My family never even had a NES or FAMICON or anything like that. It was after I got into secondary school (or high school in relevant countries) that I first came upon a computer, in the lab, with Starcraft on it. And a friend of mine taught me how to play it. It was not long before we joined a computer club, and spent the evening on 8 player LAN playing starcraft and need for speed. 

A few years after, while the playstation is considered affordable, I still can't afford it. Thankfully cheap Cyber Cafes were popping up, and we were then introduced to the original Half Life. It was not long before we discovered it can also do multiplayer. When Counter Strike came into the picture, consoles are long but forgotten.

So thank you console for being so expensive that I had to play the PC. It introduced me to Multiplayer and better graphics 



















 Here's something to chew about. Kevin Magnussen's top speed of 316.9KM/h at the Australian GP was a massive 6KM/h faster than last years's top speed of 310KM/h managed by JE Vergne, and at Australia where the straights are quite short, this is quite an acheivement. It also proves that the straight line speed is still there for the new car, and the only thing that is holding them down is the harder Pirelli tyres and lack of aero grip through the corners.

As the years goes on, engineers and designers should be able to claw back some of this deficit. Although how long do you guys think they can acheive 2013 lap times? For me personally I think it could be as quickly as the Japanese Grand Prix, or as late as middle of next season. But one thing's for sure, the "the cars are 3 seconds a lap slower" would be a thing of the past before long 



















 Have you ever went back to look at the old pictures that you took, and thought to yourself, "Man, I was crap back then". 

For example some of my earliest ones: 

http://i.imgur.com/ua5k3hA.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/vHae0XP.jpg

I actually cringed and wondered how on earth I thought it was good back then

 




 I was really hyped to play Titanfall, but after two days of playing, I am back to BF4. Reasons?

 Smaller maps and less players. While I have nothing against small maps, the 6 vs 6 kills me off after being used to 32 vs 32

 Less emphasize towards team play. Everybody just plays for themselves. Even on a small scale server BF4 has more tactics

 You can spend 15 minutes just waiting for someone to join in for campaign. You have someone leaving the lobby? Resets everything. 

 Multiplayer server search is also broken and unbalanced. Level 1? Let me lump you with other level 1 players, while the other side consisted of level 20++ players. 

 Also, you can stuck with six players on either Militia or IMC, and you can't send half of them to the other side. Honestly battlelog is miles better than this

 Hit detection is much worse. You can run into things that is not really there, and swear you shoot someone just to see him one shoot kill you back. And this is with low ping and feels much more worse than BF4's "netcode"

Welp, as shit as BF4 is, it's still a better game for me honestly 




 Might be my location (SE Asia) but trying to play campaign, it's like I have to wait at least 15 minutes before I can even play as the server tries to find players. And when we do find players, we have to wait 90 seconds, and as the clock counts down, someone disconnected, and the counter resets. 

Not only that, for other modes, EVERYONE is on attrition that I waited for 1 hour at the CTF mode without anybody joining. Heck, I was lumped with 4 people in IMC and we were perplexed as why not split two and send them to Militia.

Also network needs better hit detection. I was killed countless times by someone that I shot first but when I look at the killcam, I was not even moving or shooting the other guy. This is with ping lower than 20 at all servers.

 For the past two days now, randomly when I use mortar, there was no kill confirm even tho I kill someone with it. The kill does count towards your total kill in the scoreboard, but you won't get the 100 points for killing a person. All the other bonus, like Kill Streak End, Multi Kills, Squad Wipe, etc are shown, hence how I know I was killing with the mortar most of the time.  














 Ever since BF4 was updated to be able to use Mantle, I've been running the graphic overlay command to tell wether or not I am running D3D11.1 or Mantle. One of the information that the overlay tells are the Job Thread, how many threads that are being used by BF4.

Usually BF4 will use threads half the number of your CPU's core, for example, a quad core CPU will use two threads, while an 8 core CPU will use four. Mantle usually use one extra, so this means 3 and 5 respectively.

What I notice after that fucked up February patch that lead to some maps (Dawnbreaker, Locker, Metro) crashing is that I won't crash on a PC that are using more than two threads. I have three different PCs, an Intel i5 2500K, an AMD A10 7700K Kaveri, and an Intel i7 4700K. Only the i7 does not crash on DX11.1 mode, since it's an "8 core CPU", thus BF4 are running on 4 job threads. 

I will however get crashes on the i5 and the AMD A10 on DX11.1 mode which are running only 2 job threads. Using Mantle which bumps the Job Thread to 3, game runs fine without crashing.

Might be something to look into by DICE 









 While this beta test is to stress test the servers, we are also in a way testing out all the other features of the game itself. Now what do you guys feel that need to be added/changed in the full game once it comes out? Balances or fixes?

For me

- I prefer the hold to zoom for iron sight and the press once to engage feels too like... COD. I hope there is an option to turn this off (either that or I did not go through the option long enough)

- Matchmaking should be done by player rank. I hate when one side is full of level  10 while the other sides are full of 1s and 2s. I was lucky that my first few rounds were with high level players, but after that I grew frustrated quickly when I was thrown in with lower leveled players. This was worse since Respawn turned off chat in beta so I can't tell them to spawn the titan at the same time.

Other than the too COD like feel of the game, I have nothing much to complain. I do miss a game that is larger and more tactical but I am saving my views on that after the full game comes out 









 Tested on my rig, and I can confirm that this is a D3D error. Was using SLi GTX680 and keep crashing at Locker, Paracel and Dawnbreaker after the update. Changed to single card and it did not help. Changed to borderless and it did not help

Swapped to an R9 280X, and still crashed. So I changed to Mantle, and restarted the PC and now it works. I am still not amused with DICE tho. What I can surmise is that their Mantle compatibility fix is map specific, and it broke some Direct3D setting 














 The built in team balancing options for servers right now is quite basic, and once it detects that one team has a number of more players, it will take the first person that has been killed on the other side and bring it to the unbalanced side. 

This, while is logical sometimes can be infuriating, moreso in RUSH and OB. Three times in Rush, I died after arming an MCOM to see I was moved to the other side. There was an ironic moment when I died arming the last MCOM with the ticket count is less than 10, and I was moved to the other side to see my arm lead the other side to victory, while I was given a lost, even tho I was the one that armed that last MCOM.

For me, this is what I think should be done for team balancing

- No player movement should happen in RUSH once the tickets are are low enough (15 or less)
- Players who died PTFO (capping, arming a bomb or MCOM) should not be moved
- Players that has a high number of captures/MCOM arming or defending or bomb arm should be given "less priority" to be moved

Feel free to add your idea, or fix mine 


































 Remember when the time that mortar was really overpowered? Dice patched. Now mortar can't be reloaded by support pack, and surprisingly, whomever using mortar can't reload grenades. I kinda understand that logic of losing mortar would loose it for that life. but not having the ability to reload grenades as well is kinda annoying since once your mortar is dead and you are out of grenades, your options are limited to your primary and secondary weapon. There are times that I can't even help my teammate who is in a pinch since I don't have any projectile weapons anymore.

So Dice, please give back the ability to reload nades. I will do anything for you. I will even post good reviews of BF4 on youtube if you want me to 









 I am amazed not many people are asking for this to be fixed. As seen here: http://imgur.com/3bYuffE there are quite a few broken things, for one mortars stats are still not shown unless you click on it. Also some vehicles are given more service stars than they should, while in this case the mobile artillery is not given even tho I have more than 100 kills using it already  









 Usually I will get this error when the PC has been turned on for a while. At first I did as what it was said, using Task Manager to manually kill BF4.exe, but one day I realised that it was actually working, and if you wait a bit longer, the game will run as intended.

Just a heads up for anyone getting annoyed with this error 







































 As title. As it seems, there seems to be no easy way for the attackers to counter this tactic. The defenders can have two or three engy to fix the MBT and the MBT could cover any threat going down the mall 
































































 Encountered this problem when I can't join any server that is hosting China Rising map, even tho I am a premium user when I am using my laptop. Seems that Origin did not add a key in your windows registery, which is used by Battlelog to see if you have installed the DLC

1 - Open regedit

2 - Browse to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE  Software  Wow6432Node  EA Games  Battlefield 4 (64 bit) or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE  Software  EA Games  Battlefield 4 (32 bit)

3 - Add new key in Battlefield 4 named "Xpack1" 

4 - In Xpack1, add a new string, name: "Installed" value: 1


Go back to Battlelog and voila! you can now join the previously unjoinable servers 





































































 For two days after the patch, when I am playing support, I can only now use one mortar per life, and it won't reload even if I am sitting on top of my ammo box. Heck, it won't reload my nades even, so I feel it's more of a bug than a nerf. 

Ammo reload is fine for some reason 




 Sorry if anybody posted this issue, but everytime I kill using mortar, it just put there [] enemy name with the [] should have the weapon name inside it. And even when I look into my stats, my mortar kills are still 0, even tho I have killed quite a number of people with it. 

Anybody else have the same problem? 





























 Since the Recon class in BF4 has the PLD, as well as the ability to "zero" the optics, I wonder how long does it take til two recons work in tandem, with one using the PLD to gauge how far the target is, and the second one will snipe accordingly. 

This combo in theory would be faster (since only one recon is scouting, so there is not time wasted between switching from the PLD to the rifle and then adjusting the scope) and much more safer (spotter can also watch out for other threats incoming) 


































 forgot to take a pic of it but you can see the giant screen at C briefly showing BSOD before th building collapse. gives a new meaning to "computer crash" eh? 




 Usually when I join a server, it will auto give me the assault class, and even if I have changed class, if the round ends and we start a new one, I am still changed to the assault. 

How do I stop this? In BF3, the class chosen is the last one you used in the round before, which is what people usually would expect 



















 Newbie gamer here. Basically, why does game titles from Activision rarely have any price drops, if at all. I've seen many games, sometimes even new ones that were being sold, usually during "sales" or "promotion" periods for just the fraction of the original costs. I remember buying Tomb Raider (2013) during a promotion period for just 10 bucks, and yet I rarely seen Activision's game drop near this price range. Was hoping to see an at least 75% discount on the Activision sale this weekend but the most was only 50%, and even then it's only for one title per day. 

Is it because the games by Activision deserve the price that they are selling them at?  













































































































 Much more worth it. Faster, silent, and less power
 




 They are actually two similar cards. Just that the control panel gets weird sometimes

 Right click on desktop --  NVIDIA control Panel 




 Around + 50 to 70% performance gain, depending on the game and if NVIDIA has optimised the drivers for the game 




 Miles better. I barely got 40FPS on Asetto Corsa on FULL settings with the GTX680 SLi. Now I am getting 100++ FPS 




 Which card? I've use the GTX980 reference card and it had no problem 




 You can see at the bottom it's set to the 2nd card

2. Why would you put a 120Hz monitor on an inferior connection? HDMI won't have the sufficient bandwidth compared to a DVI-D 














 IIRC it's Grand Chelem 




 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Link_Interface

I based my explanation on this + forums and google. Usually when a new driver is announced by AMD/Nvidia, you can read in the update notes things like 

Optimised (game name here) for SLi/Crossfire

So that's how we can guess the drivers is the one handling the workload.  




 Usually the multi GPU setup is optimised by the drivers which will tell the GPU how to allocate the workload. even if the game is not optimised for multi GPU, the driver will make it work 




 The reaso  for red flag was ambulance on track i think 









 It's called panning. Focus on the subject, use low shutter speed, and burst the trigger while following the car in motion. usually 1 or 2 in 10 of your burst shots would be good enough as with the OP's shot.

 The back straight has a 45% view of the back side of the circuit. I totally recommend sitting here as it's cheaper than the front straight

Since i live in KL, the track is quite accessible by car, albeit will take a little time to reach there.  




 Win win situation for both honestly. Honda need a team to enter, and McLaren needs an engine manufacturer to back them up after loosing Mercedes monies 




 Tyres, and he was using less fuel than anybody else up to that point 




 Give him any kind of car, and he will drive it. While Alonso can be said to have a similar ability, Hamilton seems to just be able to get in the car, and just drive it, while Alonso might need more time to learn the car. 

I was impressed with Hamilton in 2009. He managed to wring that POS McLaren to places and wins that it was not supposed to have. It might be that during that time he used the car to learn how to drive on the edge, but yet save fuel and save his tyres, two thing that he was really bad at in 2008 and 2007

I still rate Alonso higher as he is the most complete package on the grid today, but I really love Hamilton as the pure racing driver 




 They are busy turning left 




 I think Crofty and Brundle were talking about what can be considered as taking an advantage, and Brundle explained that the stewards would see the sector times and their own racing experience to judge wether or not a driver gains or loses any advantage. 

Since Hamilton lost a lot of time on the first sector, he was deemed to have made a mistake and nothing more was thought of that 




 His highest was third IIRC in 2009 in the most shittiest McLaren ever. Never had much luck since. Usually incidents, and the most weird was the broken third spring that nobody realised in 2011 or 12

 In anticipation of BF3 beta, bought two HD6850 thinking it would be enough. After 2 hours, sold it back and bought two GTX570, a new motherboard, and a new casing. 




 They still do. It's just not televised 




 It's hard not to get coverage without ads. Bernie charges A LOT for F1 broadcasting, and stations usually cover this cost by selling ad slots. Sky basically could run the coverage without ads because they can cover up the losses through other channels, and even then you have ads during free practice and qualy, and this is in a country where the F1 viewers are usually high

For North America, where the F1 viewer numbers are usually less than Europe, they have no choice. They have to have the ads. But if you find them too obtrusive, I suggest emailing them and suggeting them to make a side by side window for the ads. There are a lot of other sporting events where the ads are shown at the same time with the main sport. 






















































 F1 has long been dominated by European drivers. But once in a while you would see drivers from other continents, like Australia, South America and North America making a name for themselves in the sports. One continent that has the least amount of drivers competing in the sport is Asia. Currently, only Japan's Kamui Kobayashi is representing Asia in the sport. 

Let's take a look at up and coming prospects from Asia that might one day end up with a race seat in one of the F1 teams in the future

.............................................................................................................................



**Ma Qinghua** (China) - 26 y/o

**Sponsors:** *Unknown*

**Current Drive** Citron Total WTCC (*WTCC*)

The great hope of China, Ma was the Chinese chosen driver for the ill fated A1 Grand Prix series. He has a lot of European single seater race experience under his belt, and was the test driver for HRT and Caterham. Now driving for Citroen in the WTCC series. Is the first Chinese driver to win a WTCC round when he won in Russia

**Chances:** *Slim*   


................................................................................................................................



**Takuya Izawa** (Japan) - 31 y/o

**Sponsors:** *Honda?*

**Current Drive** ART Grand Prix Team (*GP2*)

A former Formula Nippon driver for Team Aguri, Izawa made a name for himself in the Japanese touring car race series, Super GT. Made a jump to European single seater this year as a driver for the highly rated ART Grand Prix team. Has had a lackluster season, but he had his first podium finish in Hungary after Colletti was penalised. 

**Chances:** *Slim (Might end up having a test driver role when Honda joins F1)*   


................................................................................................................................



**Rio Haryanto** (Indonesia) - 21 y/o

**Sponsors:** *Pertamina*

**Current Drive** EQ8 Caterham Racing (*GP2*)

Raced in single seater series in Asia and Australia, Rio made a move to European single seater in 2010 competing in GP3. He was mightily impressive, even winning a race in Turkey, and winning two more races in 2011. Was Max Chilton's partner in GP2. Considered a fast driver, but needs more experience under his belt. He is also the first Indonesian driver to qualify for a Superlicense. 

**Chances:** *Moderate (Pertamina might buy him a seat in the future)*   


................................................................................................................................



**Kimiya Sato** (Japan) - 24 y/o

**Sponsors:** *Unknown*

**Current Drive** Campos Racing (*GP2*), Euronova Racing (*AutoGP*)

A young and upcoming driver from the land of the rising sun, Kimiya amazingly started his single seater career in the UK with the Formula BMW racing series before going back to Japan. He was the runner's up in the 2009 All Japan Formula 3 National series, before making the trip back to Europe to join the Formula 3 Euro Series. Runners up in the AutoGP championship last year, and now racing in both GP2 and AutoGP. Currently leading the AutoGP championship, but having a torrid time in GP2. 

**Chances:** *High (Honda might find him the best bet to give a racing seat to a Japanese driver)*   


................................................................................................................................



**Sean Gelael** (Indonesia) - 17 y/o

**Sponsors:** *KFC Indonesia*

**Current Drive** Jagonya Ayam with Carlin (*F3*)

This young driver from Indonesia made a fast rise in his career. Only started professional racing in 2011, racing in the Asian Kartin series where he finished third. Wasting no time he moved to Europe just two years later competing in Formula 3. Currently in his second year of F3. Still has yet to show his rumoured potential.  

**Chances:** *Moderate/Low (Unless he shows results in the next few years, it's doubtful that he could break into F1, especially since Carlin is one of the best racing team in single seater. Considering that his sponsors is not really a traditional name in motorsports, they are most likely not to pay for his F1 seat)*   


................................................................................................................................



**Jazeman Jaafar** (Malaysia) - 21 y/o

**Sponsors:** *Petronas*

**Current Drive** ISR Racing (*Formula Renault 3.5*), HTP Motorsports (*Blancpain GT Series - One off race*)

Malaysia's hope for the future, Jazeman competed in karting in both Malaysia and Europe. Was one of the few drivers given a special leeway when he wanted to join Formula BMW Asia due to his really young age. Won the championship in hist first year, he then moved to Europe, competing with Raikkonen Robertson Racing. He then moved to Carlin to drive for their Formula 3 team. Had a lackluster two years before finishing second in British F3 in 2012. He then moved to Formula Renault 3.5 for again Carlin, before he moved to ISR Racing this year. Has a couple of podium in Monaco and Spa as well as finishing 5th in the Spa 24 hour race this year with HTP Motorsports.

**Chances:** *Moderate/High (A Petronas Motorsports development talent and might be given the test seat for Mercedes due to the close relationship with Petronas Motorsports and Mercedes)*

FAQ

**What is this?**

It's a *free* streaming site that I use to stream sports from my home. I actually use it so that I can watch my own TV when I am at the office, as I usually work 10~12 hours a day 

**What will you be streaming?**

Sports, mostly football and motorsports. Priorities for Formula 1 and Arsenal, in that order.

**What is the quality of your stream?**

Due to location (I am in Asia, and I am streaming it to a Ustream server in the USA) I limit the stream to 720p, 25fps, 1.5Mbps. 

**Why Ustream and not (insert the streaming choice of my liking)**

Because it's easy, and it can be watched by everyone no matter if they are on a PC or on a mobile phone. Also they are a bit lax on DMCA takedown. And if my stream do get taken down, registering another account is really easy. Also it's the fastest non pay RTMP streaming service that I have tested

**What is the channel source?**

Malaysian cable sports channel. So you won't get the same pre/post match thing that you would expect or get from UK channels. Also be prepared for last minute changes and fuck ups. 

**Are you making any monies from this?**

I do put some google ads on the site, but I don't actually care, as the monies from the ads can barely pay the monthly fees for internet and cable tv here. Also doing this to help fellow Gooners and F1 fans

If you guys have any questions or request, go on ahead! 









 Now that the summer break is here, how would you rate the drivers up till now?

Nico Rosberg

Calm, smart, and calculating. Took his chances and took it well. It's not surprising that he is leading the championship. But if there is an achilles heel, it's that he needs all of his engineers input to make his driving faster, and IMO this is what could derail his championship run at the end of the season


Lewis Hamilton

Definately the driver to watch. He is unlucky not to be leading the championship. But honestly the two drivers from the back of the grid to the podium in Germany and Hungary was the drives of the season. For the people who disagree, I would like to remind you that he drove in Germany with brakes that he hates, and in Hungary with a rebuilt car that he have no idea how it feels. He could still pip Nico at the end of the season


Daniel Ricciardo

Revelation of the season. Calm and adapted to life in the Red Bull like duck to water. If it's not for the Mercedes total domination, he could be up there fighting for the championship. Next year he will definately be closer tho. Expect more wins to come this season yet.


Seb Vettel

The loss of the blown diffuser hits him more than any other drivers on the grid. Still not being able to adapt to the new car, nevertheless he has been calm and mature. Other than the "tough luck" moment earlier in the season, he is quite okay with his teammate being faster. Might end up finding his form again after the season resumes


Nando Alonso

Best driver in the grid in not the best car on the grid. Flatters the Ferrari more than it actually should. The second half of the season would see if he stays at Ferrari or find a better team. 


Kimi Raikkonen

Struggling. That is the only way to describe him this season. And his bad back is definately not helping. Add to Ferrari's questionable tactics and strategy he finds himself in places he should not be at in the first place. Might be his last season in F1.


Valterri Bottas

Next great Finnish hope. Finished the half season with a lot of good drives. Took his chances and shows that he is faster than his much older teammate. If Williams can find more speed in the car, then he could find himself a win in the second half of the season, especially if the Mercs trips over each other


Felipe Massa

Guy can't seem to find a break. His bad luck, especially at the start of races seems to be much more worse than Hamilton's. Struggling to keep pace with his teammate


Jenson Button

Missing Hamilton's setup input. Does not help the McLaren is shit. With the departure of Whitmarsh, his place in the team is also under threat as Ron is not really his largest fan. Might be his last season with the team, unless he can turn his season around


Kevin Magnussen

Started the season with a podium but slid back. Shows some flashes of speed. But still does not show anything special, yet.
 
























 After seeing all of these 60FPS jokes on the console peasants, I was thinking, does it really matters to everyone here personally?

 











































































































































 http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10158756

Only selected races were recorded by me due to various reasons

- No race 1-3, as I had not acquired a capture card when it aird
- No race 10, as my cable provider did not air the Friday's race, and never aired a repeat of it.

All races are in 720p, 50FPS, at around 5mbps bitrate.

Enjoy 














 I mean honestly, year after year they would always amaze me. No matter what kind of rules that are thrown at them, there will be always someone, somewhere that can find a solution to the problem, and will be then copied down the grid. 

After 5 races, I can see the car can potentially be as fast as last year, and considering how much the FIA are restricting the downforce and aero, this is no mean feat. 














 It's interesting to see that everytime the fuel graphics comes out, it's Lewis Hamilton (and to some extent, the Williams) that is using the least fuel than anyone else during a race weekend.

This combined with the ability to still post competitive time is really quite amazing considering that people says he is an "all out driver". This could play into his hand later in the year if he needs some more power when push comes to shoves 



















 Tuned in to GP3, and found out the track is damp. This might change the race later today as tyre wear will worsen

 I honestly think it was actually a segment meant to get Reigns over, but Heyman, being Heyman, well maybe he feels that he would give his 2 cents, in a non direct kind of way

I do honestly feel he was being sarcastic. When he went to the ring, he looks visibly scared of DBry, but he was not so of Reigns. Why would you be scared of a guy that had lost to the person that you're going to meet?  









 is it just me or Heyman is actually burying Reigns now?

 Visibility as well as using your phone to listen to the trackside commentary. The track has their own commentators which is broadcasted over FM. Just need to tune in to the right channel 

 




 I don't remember if turn 15 itself has a screen, but if you see my pic the screen I was telling you can be  seen near the placing tower near turn 9

 Thanks for pointing that out

 I read somewhere that Hamilton learnt French so that he could communicate better with his ART mechanics during his GP2 year 




 I don't think that's true. The only thing they told their customer teams were not to use a higher engine power mapping (than what the works team are using) if they are in fight with the works team. It was in one of Ted's feature in Bahrain when they were talking to Smedley. 

Officially it's to stop both team to one up each other in term of the engine power in a race, which could lead both engine to retire prematurely (the ICE need to last 4 races) 




 FI also uses Mercedes gearbox. Hence they had the same gear ratio with Mercedes throughout the year (the long 7th gear that did not go into 8th unlike all the other teams) 




 It started in the 90s I think, when a driver has to nominate which tyres they would use in the race. The tyre manufacturer will bring two compounds, a prime (which would be the safe tyre) or the option (a softer tyre that would be faster but won't last as long). 

Once you made the decision, you will be stuck with it for the whole of the race. As you can see at this moment in history, there is no reason for tyre mismatch, as you're stuck with one compound of tyres!

The Option + Prime combo usage was decided by Bernie to spice up racing, as seen from it's highly effective use in America's CART series. A lot of people have asked if they can mix and match the tyre compound, as every year you would hear Martin Brundle mention it at least twice. But the FIA had shot down the idea quickly as it would be "confusing to the viewers".

Note that not only you can't mix the tyre compounds, but you also can't switch which tyre side. For example you can't switch a left front tyre to a front right tyre. Juan Pablo Montoya's McLaren had it's front tyre mistakenly switch around, and in the race he complained that the car felt like it had a puncture.

 They cater to casual or first time Formula one fans. And mostly the good writers are usually from Autosport. Most of the ex drivers or the one inside the business are good pundits, or opinion givers, but they are not writers. It's a different thing talking compared to writing an article piece. 

I do still read the magazine tho, because sometimes there might be hidden gems, really good articles that you did not expect to read. But those are rare and few.

 If you're using a server, yes. But unless your OS is optimised for it (read: Linux server for multithreading) it's worthless 




 Depends on the chipset. Only LGA2011's X79 and X99 chipset supports for quad channel RAM, hence the 8 RAM slots. You won't usually see normal consumer use this, as these are targeted for really hardcore gamers/overclockers, and cost a bomb

If you're sticking to the Intel Z97/Z87 based boards, you won't get more than 4 RAM slots as the processor only supports dual channel RAM 




 No, but if you're an overclocker, those extra capacitors and MOSFETS on the larger board leads to better and much more stable overclocking. Hence why you don't see overclockers use mini ITX boards

 Yes. Also due to logistic reason, it's easy to go to Malaysia from Australia. 
Singapore could in theory swap place with Malaysia, making it Australia - singapore - Bahrain, but that would mean putting Singapore in the rainy season, and they don't want this to happen.

besides, a dry Malaysia is miles better than a dry Singapore, what's more a wet Sepang? 









 Formula E also uses rFactor for their simulators whenever they have a race. the mod is built by an Australian modding team with inputs by the team. talked to them back when Formula E was had a race in Putrajaya

 They need to alert Brock and Reigns to plan out a new finish to the match. Hence they needed all three at the same time for this. The Stomp = F5 = Spear = Stomp = pin looks like it was planned with detail, and won't happen if any one of them was out of the loop

 Meltzer believes that Lesnar was fully informed of the new plan before he signed his new contract last Tuesday.

This I think is the most crucial part of that. It shows that the creative already had it planned, but kept it from both Seth and Reigns. The decision might even be because of Bork himself, as he might have refused a new contract if he was pinned.

Reigns and the whole Anoa'i family might have been told after Royal Rumble that he would win, but they changed heart after all the heat he is getting, which makes sense with all the dirtsheet news we are reading

Or, this is just an elaborate April Fool by Meltzer

 Also as long as they (Mercs) are winning or near the top, other teams would want their engines, which in turn would be profitable in the long run as well.
 




 iirc the biggest merchandise movers are the kids that would ask their parents to buy them stuffs.
 Smarks would look at the price, balk and walk away 




 Helps that he's charismatic as hell and I was surprised to know that NXT is his first wrestling stint. He looks so comfortable in the ring and with the crowd 




 She should get Snoop Dog to do her Main Roster song 




 They could make her (him) wear some generic cosplay for weekly and house shows, and get a licensed costume + song for PPVs ala Finn Balor 




 "So this is where the big boys plays huh?" 




 And it does not even have to be a diva. They could make it ala Nagashima Yuichirou.  




 Who was Mr America 




 You're right. Didn't notice that it's still 28nm. Might be they are still struggling to manufacture/fabricate 22nm chips for it to be financially viable for end users 




 The card is heavy and the reference design does not have a backplate. Wait for ASUS or MSI to manufacture one with backplate. Not only it keeps the card from sagging, it dissipate heat better too 




 I don't think you can use a VRAM the same way as you can use your onboard RAM, correct me if I'm wrong tho ^^; 




 Just woke up. Sorry. It's morning in Asia and I had a long day

- Gallery updated with some more pics, but since the NDA has long gone, you guys should have seen pictures/benchmarks floating from other sites already

- 3D Mark score for Firestrike Extreme http://www.3dmark.com/3dm/6261359

- In comparison, a GTX980 running on the same machine http://www.3dmark.com/3dm/5555099

- Card is quite hot. Nvidia should find another design to be honest. Can't wait for an MSI or ASUS version with a proper backplate 









 Sample, hence the NDA 




 DX11.2 / Win8.1 sadly. 




 I don't think Twitch would mind if it's from NVIDIA or AMD since it's mostly about gaming at the end 




 Ironically doing just that. Rendering a 6Mbps VC1 video to two pass 3Mbps H264 while running Assetto Corsa.  




 If you seen or touched the Nvidia engineering sample GTX980, it's basically the same.  




 yes 




 ironically twitch is all twitchy for me. Ustream is smoother 




 6 more hours. ;-)

They are showing the keynote live as well: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/gpu-technology-conference-2015 




 not until the NDA is over sadly. Sorry mate :/ 









 They would let a wrestler do it, if they tell Vince in advance that they are doing it. 

CM Punk did it to Cena without clearance and was reprimanded. I don't see any problem for Bork to do it if he gets the proper clearance 




 Apparently Vince thought when people points to the WM sign it looks weird so they add the play button, implying they are pressing that 




 Also while people (and even WWE) make it sounds like he inherited the business, he bought out the company from his father. 




 Hopefully I won't be a McLaren. At least Virgin fought to be Manor

That aside, not all press conference are shown or aired. For example the one after the British GP where Hamilton got his hand on the real trophy and shown it to the media was not aired. We only knew it after journalist tweeted the picture out 




 Honda CAN give them engines, just not this year, as they have an exclusive deal with McLaren. And looking back at today, Helmut Marko would rather have the Renault than the Honda 




 This is from the media press conference right? They usually never record/show this on TV. Unless FIA releases them on their youtube channel

 Random stupid question. Was watching the qualy replay and there was a mention that Manor's old base has been sold to Haas. 

Could two teams share a base? For example, Manor rent some space from their old base/factory from Haas.  




 There should be a list of all the bumps Hebner took in his career

 Ah, that means you will be able to access http://www.racematelive.com/

It's Fox Sports F1 companion site, where they stream onboard, live timing, pit lane camera, etc. Region locked to the country that they are showing F1 tho 




 Asia 




 Because I've been watching it for the last few years? 




 The irony is the BBC needs him as much as he needs the BBC. 

The reason that Top Gear works is that Top Gear buys most the cars (with taxpayer's money mind you) they feature on the show (except for special cars like from Ferrari), hence when the presenters gave some bad reviews, car companies can't retaliate. This is what makes Top Gear special, as they can basically say what they want without repercussion, something other car shows, which the cars are sponsored, can't do 




 Why not just get the old Arrows three seater? Get a paid rich kid in the third seat. That way you can have money AND have an actually good driver driving the car 




 Is the mechanic on top of the roof drunk? :D 









 True. I had a hard time finding Sin Cara's matches in the network 




 IIRC Billy Gunn and Road Dogg are also travelling with the WWE show hence they need someone that is always at the performance centre to be the head trainer 




 *Every time Corey Graves hands over the mic*

"Hey yo!" 




 Hence the NXT special you see happening this week. For a PPV, no.

They have an agreement with FSU, and it's better for the students of FSU to see and learn in FSU itself. Remember, the students are NOT learning how to be a WWE staff, but they are learning how to produce a TV show in general 




 As much as I also wants to see this, it won't happen. The Takeover special is always done at Full-Sail for the students there to learn how WWE makes a live show/PPV.  




  Mercedes-AMG GT S and Mercedes-AMG C 63 S respectively. 














 I have question dear Mr Bork sir, does Mr Bork prefer fighting with Goat Man, or Steroid Infused Man for the gold shiny thing? 









  Scott speed

Isn't Scott an American? 




 Watching it in a cinema is awesome, especially with the 7.1 audio. 

- animation is as good as it can be, but the CGI sometime looks overdone. I love how the crowd was animated/CGI'ed. They do not look copy pasted, but looks like a crowd of individuals

- I know the manga was kind of funny. But I never expected they would keep it in the movie. Lucifer/Ral adventure was kinda weird to watch, but man it was funny

- After watching this, now I realised why Char/Casval hated Amuro. He was the original angsty, emo kid in a death machine and Amuro stole that gimmick 




 http://i.imgur.com/PbMFBfG.jpg thank god they are showing it on cinema here 









 Didn't they do this for most of their cars? I remember there was an article on the Red Bull in Hungary (I forgot which year) that they arrived expecting it to be hot, but after finding out the temp is not that high, they paneled off the cooling vents 




 because only 6 cars have cameras in them per race?  
























 You also have to look at the audience. Majority of the Sepang and Singapore audience are tourist/foreigners, especially Aussies. Most would certainly choose only one over the other 




 What /u/FreakyJk means that with the near proximity, there are higher chances of split audience. COTA and Mexico has a larger location gap, which means that Mexicans that are closer to COTA would choose there instead of the Mexican GP.  




 Sepang after Singapore? And that's too near the usual slot for Sepang's Moto GP. I forsee my budget for Sept/Oct will be tighter than usual ;A; 









 he had prosthetic. only the lower part of his foot is crushed so he could still walk  




 Dunno man. It was awesome to see it the first time, with Vampiro marking out. 

But too much of the same thing will make it boring. When I see that gif now for me it's like "yep, a dive and catch" 




 Because they need someone to fill Bryan's slot on Smackdown ASAP? As I said, it was also because they promised the IC Championship match on ER, but it was cut out due to Bryan's injury. IMO the original original content plan for today was that Renee's segment where she interviewed Rollins 




 As with the title, could everyone post their wheel settings in this thread? It would be easier if everything in one place compared to separate thread about FANATEC, Thrustmaster or Logitech littered around.

And also a request, could anybody explain the Steering Saturation and Steering Linearity in this game? Getting a hard time to get a 1:1 steering input with the Thrustmaster T300RS 




 IIRC the world feed (for TV that is) for this year are using SkyF1's commentary. That's what we are getting from Fox in Malaysia. 

But true, the individual broadcasters might be a problem, as well as Bernie who seems like an old fashioned chap 




 I have a feeling the "sudden" decision to have the KotR tournament was due to Daniel Bryan's injury, and the non defense of the Intercontinental title at ER. 

This way, they give the viewers a "title" match, give some talents the needed exposure (Neville), give the network an extra network only show, and still keep the title on Bryan until they figure out how long he will be out. 




 Does all the travelling takes a toll on you? 
And which circuit do you always looking forward to go every year?
Do you think F1 would be more popular if it introduces a legal pay stream?

 




 It should work, as long as the controller is a directInputDevice compatible 














 Depends on your location. It was out for me since 4 hours ago 









 Bloody hell, i never realised that it would lap nearly the same as one would at Spa. And in comparison Mt Panorama is just 6.2km compared to 7km of Spa

 Gee I wonder which engine manufacturer would want to actually make a V8 after investing so much in V6 Vijay? certainty not the one providing your current engine 




 hence his drug abuse. WWE seems to be toning Neville's ability down to keep him from hurting himself and rely on painkillers. 









 /r/firstworldanarchists 




 Had a chance to get Roman to win the KotR and get him over with marks

WWE does not include him in the tournament, and stick him with Rollins storyline instead

Fuck this company 




 kayfabe wise, more surface area to throw your opponent in 




 Dean Ambrose has finally won a PPV Singles Match, stretching back from MITB 2014. 

 




 IT WAS YOUR NOTEPAD! 




 "E C DUB! E C DUB! E C DUB!" 




 Pretty okay match. I mean it was a spot fest in a mark town, so props to that. But the match did nothing in showing Reigns wrestling ability. It only shows he can take bumps. The tag team match was a whole lot more entertaining than this match in terms of wrestling move and in ring skills.

Interestingly I was more entertained by the Big Show's attitude. 




 Basically he needs to be what Rocky Maivia did when he turned into The Rock. They seemed similar. Both pushed to the moon, and got chewed out by the fans. 

The only difference was The Rock was repackaged into a heel, and made it work, but Reigns did not change, and is still hand held through everything.  




 "Austin 3:16 says I just whipped your ass!" 




 nor the fact that most stores activates their games on STEAM as well? 









 Physics told us it wont happen. To do quick release system for engine would introduce high stressed parts, especially on the drivetrain. That does not include the fact that they need to unplug and replug the fuel line, which introduce danger. 

The only real solution would be to make the whole rear detachable. But that would mean a weaker monocoque they wpuld flex and roll and in the end disintegrate the car. To renforce it would mean added weight. And there is no way they would want a heavy car because that would offset any advantage they would have in the first place 




 Quick, yes. But one minute change? No.  




 Only the lap times. The speeds is most likely there since there are less aero drags 




 It takes nearly half a minute to change a front wing. And that't just taking off four pins, taking off the old wing, put on a new one, and putting on a pin again. 

An engine much more complicated. Considering that the modern engine now is ICE, where it interconnects to each other, and more importantly connects to a drivetrain that connects to the rear of the chassis. That would at least take an hour of work. 




 A minute

I doubt an engine change would take that fast 




 Bray - Undahteika, Harper - Kane?

New tag team playa! Holla holla 




 While the current dates on his previous contract has been fulfilled, we have no idea if Sting and WWE have an agreement for a future contract. It's all up in the air

That being said I'll mark out if he suddenly appears in LU 




 They told the teams to not used the tyres in weird ways before the Silverstone incident. And yet they were the ones looking bad after that 




 weird. I don't think FFB would have any problems.

My settings are
Deadzone: 0%
FFB Type: Wheel
FFB Strength: Med
FFB Dampening: 0%

all the others are on default

My steering is the Thrustmaster T300RS + Ferrari F1 Rim 




 Yes. That's what I thought as well. Pirelli won't want the Silverstone debacle again, as well as the FIA. Imagine a team using the SS at Sepang, and it hit the cliff in the middle of the lap sending the car careering off. Won't be a good PR 




 Did you change controller type? When you set it at gamepad/joystick, the game change the input based on how long you press/hold.

Changing it to Wheel makes it use analogue input instead 




 They are really sweet tho, even in kayfabe. Thank god they hooked up before the WWE ban on internal relationship took place 




 Why are all the other sponsors are kept, while Marlboro is coughing? 




 Holy shit thanks! 




 The link to download CTDP 05 from their site is dead tho :/

Only the new mods seems to be downloadable

http://www.ctdp.net/

Edit: Oh, it's actually back up. My mistake

Edit edit: Any way I can get their old F1 1998 Mod tho? 




 Yeah. The map will have track numbers on them so that they can easily identify and which corner when communicating with engineers

Some teams have them on the steering like so:

 Assetto Corsa. Actually it looks quite good. but the encoding for the video was bad since I selected frame blending in Premiere and quite a low bitrate 




 It was made by ISI. The base game engine (gMotor) IS a full blown simulator and was used to make: -

- rFactor (gMotor2)

-- rFactor team version, which some teams uses for promo purposes on roadshow. McLaren uses this. Also Formula E road show uses this modded version at all of their races.

-- rFactor Pro, of which some F1 teams like Red Bull and Toro Rosso uses for their simulator. 

-- rFactor 2, an updated version of rFactor with DX11 support

- GTR/GTR 2 (gMotor2)

-- Developer of GTR, Simbin/Slightly Mad Studios went on to make NFS Shift and Shift 2 with only some game engine, with graphic updates. 

- Reiza Studio's Stock Car Extreme, Formula Truck and Copa Petrobras. (gMotor2)

 




 I'm not even mad. I was just curious ^^;

For comparison, here's how a 2014/15 game looks like. 10 years really do make a lot of difference 




 After playing it last night I still love it. I just hate that the 16:9 resolution is limited to 1600x900 only without any option to go to Full HD :/

I miss my old mods tho. The CTDP 2005 Mod was one of the best F1 mod I've ever driven on F1 Challenge. 




 Ah no wonder 




 With the game voiceover telling it's "Magny Cours" I'd never thought anybody would miss that 









 It's just a sarcastic joke :/ 




 Won't be long before we see some of the talents on LU appear in NXT 




 The original is still better 




 Not blackjack mulligan 




 David and Devitt are pronounced the same in Japanese,  (Deibiddo). It makes no sense for him to change anything since it won't do anything. What's most likely was the Prince () was added because Fergal (? ?) is weird in Japanese

Wiki also list his name as "Devitt" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Devitt 




 he was being funny. You need to read the tweet's timeline to get the context 




 It is. The system switched off. 




 1997

Nobody on the grid

10 years later

grid full of media 




 Depends. The token system means that Mercedes still has an advantage, at least until next year. 2017 might be their year tho, and they are looking stronger in each race 




 GTX MLXXX 




 Is Raymond Stereo still in the game or do I need to add him with mods? 




 basically it's like Onions. Onions has layers, PC/computer/console has layers.  




 I don't agree to an extent. What's the best flowing track on the calendar? Hungaroring. The drivers love it because once you're in the groove, it's like riding a roller coaster driving there. But we all know how hard it is to overtake there. 

While a circuit should be blamed, some of the problem also lies with the cars themselves. The dirty air syndrome was always something the FIA had tried to get rid of, every time they introduce a new rule. But every time they do, engineers find a way to gain more downforce in areas they could, which in turn, introduce back this problem. The rulings for 2009 for example was introduced due to this as well as various ruling there after, but almost always, the teams manage to churn out a car that still has this problem.

Combined that with Pirelli tyres that does not last that much (because oh, people want to see tyres that does not last) you have team that err on the side of caution and instruct the drivers to drive within a certain constraint.

I'll just leave this here 









 "Shh, I know it hurts man" 









 I watched it just recently. I think it was on the Network but for the love of god I forgot what show was it
 




 Both new tyres according to live timing as well on the f1 site. Which means they might be going soft - medium - medium in the race 









 I did. Turns out the network was baby butt smooth using VPN, while my country's cable company decided to show an SD version of WM, and it costs more than the network :/ 




 It's Vine. not twitter video. It's just linked on twitter 









 yeah, just realised that. Try using Hola and use Malaysia as your proxy. It's not blocked here for some reason 









 For Mercedes and Ferrari, use Puma as their kit sponsor 




 I'm waiting for his bad ass biker gimmick 




 Not legal brah 




  : 




 Never knew about this. Thanks!

This is where the Briscoe's ply their trade right? Going to see why WWE wants them so bad

 




 As said, I live in South East Asia. Other than WWE, there are basically no other wrestling program on TV shown. A cable channel did show TNA during the Hogan era, but that does not even last a year.

I am really interested in WWE alternatives, especially LU and was wondering is there a way to view them other than *cough*acquiring it via video sharing*cough*.

Thanks in advance!  




 Miles better than the force scripted ones that he was fed with. But still not on par with some of the best talkers on the current roster. Even Cena is still a better talker than him. 

Given time, he will be as good as Cena. He will never be as good as his cousin tho. 




 tubthimping by John Cena

djingis Khan by Uhaa nation 









 as once said by Jay of OSW, Dunn might hate wrestling, but he gave wwe that much needed production value 




 Because Hunico can speak english, so he and his opponent can communicate better in the ring

 But.. but... he debuted as the Man's Man

 Guy still looks like he has a few more years in him, and his in ring performance is still good. I hope he can still have his match with ~~Cody~~Stardust down the line on the grandest stage of them all. 




 From comparison, I see that a company would use Drew if they need a simple, robust but good looking/modern belt. If they want an intricate, highly decorative belt that has the retro look, they would use Millican/Parks. 




 Thanks, didn't know that. I took for granted that most belts are made by Millican or Parks

*edit*
God fucking damn it Wildcat. They put "Chris Benoit" on the US Title name plate. I can't stop laughing 




 bad encoding on Fox, combined to their auto bandwith selection for streaming lead to this. Fox also shows F1 in South East Asia, and their 1.2Mbps HD stream on their website looks washed and bad. And even when it's 1.2Mbps, it will auto downgrade to the next lowest, 400Mbps  the moment it detects a bit of lag on your internet. 

I discovered that turning off all things running in background, especially torrent, help in keeping the stream at 1.2Mbps.  




 He is going to TNA. I'm sure 




 He was over when he did that scripted shoot promo. Look it up 




 Because the girl is the awww factor?  




 But I take that WWE designed it, so that it's their own fault that it looks bad?

Also OCC and Millican worked together to make it 

http://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/10-greatest-championship-belts 









 nwa has their dome belt. for them the belt has more linage and association with nwa compared to the big gold belt. ironically, wwe also owns the original dome belt 




 did you guys know that most wrestling belts are done by one guy?

http://www.davemillicanbelts.com/

he does belts for WWE, TNA, ROH and others 









 He also said that Hamilton's soft lasted only 11 laps while Vettel lasted 14 and can do more 




 CM Punk is a lead in a harem anime. I actually think it works, and works well 




 I forgot where someone said this, but if you can hear the ring thuds in WWE, it means that the fans are silent and don't care about the match 




 https://youtu.be/5PwWjRR6uxo

checo was Banzai'ing, but only one clean overtake happened 




 im guessing he has low rear grip due to old tyres. GP2 has limited sets per weekend, and some drivers may use them all up in race one leaving them with worn tyres for race 2 




 someone send OSW lots of beer and tatoo their name and ask them to do it 




 Remember the Shockmaster? 









 awesome and good wallpaper material as well. did you render the on track pics? because those those looks damn realistic.

the design is brilliant, even tho most wont adhere to FIA rule and / or make no sense (single pillar for the front wing?) but concept car never meant to make sense.

you should tweet or email this to the Red Bull PR 




 I bought this set, altho the Ferrari was a tad too expensive 

That being said, I bought the Lego 42000 and 42039 Technic set as well 




 Neville's ear is what makes gravity forgets him 




 Reigns vs Big Show

Triple Threat feat. Reigns and Ryback

Nope, I just went to sleep rather than waste any energy 




 Super Dragon 




 Lines: the thing that Lilian Garcia forgot 




 Yep. But some of the early WWF/WWE matches were still using aluminium ladders, which flexes dangerously. Hence why they changed it to wood 




 Mike Awesome's Awesome Bomb (Running Razor's Edge). God it look so dangerous, especially since WCW has a small ring, and the guy on the end of the move usually would nearly get their head hit the turnbuckle 




 Since Renault is a French team, would the higher management be happy for them to be based in Faenza? 

If they do move, (to England's motorsport valley I presume) this would also mean the end of an era to the original Minardi team 




 I love their accent. "T-Shart" was a hilarious botch 




 Saying about Cole, not Lilian tho 




 Cole added it a bit later 
"Remember folks, this is a no disqualification match". 

Either I did not hear it the first time, or the dub it in the Network replay of WM 




 Damien Sandow winning a world title 




 I misread the OP's title as "Indian Movie" and was hyped to see JR in Bollywood :/ 




 i think he's a part timer who helps talen in nxt to learn, and not really having a real run 




 Depends on Trips honestly. Joe does not really need to prove anything, but WWE loves their superstars to toe the line, hence going to NXT to clean some rough edges so to speak 




 Remember  Rufus "Pancake" Patterson? I wish they would let him use that character more 
























 Because there might be new viewers who have no idea what it's called? 














 My only gripe with the main event was that shoddy producing with bad camera angles  




 Makes sense. He doesn't seem to have that new driver vibe to him 




 Since WWE is hard on protecting their product now, most of the new talents are given a new, copyrighted name that they can't use elsewhere. 

But there are leftover from the old era, John Cena, Randy Orton and Mark Henry were lucky to debut when trademark is not really important, or in Mark Henry's case, his name, like Kurt Angle, carried it's own weight

So /SC, which talent was the last one was allowed by the WWE to use his or her own name? 




 Depends. Jann is an exceptional talent that also adapts to the physical side of racing like duck to water. Not many people, especially people that are used to sit on their couch could commit to.

For example Gregger Huttu, who is regarded to be the fastest driver in virtual racing, was totally drained physically when he test a real racing car at Skip Barber: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p_sCrM1CcI

It helps that Jann's is a footballer, and that he might have trained with his dad. But a normal person who has no physical training prior? he might have a harder time 




 I know, IIRC it was more than that the last time. But I was just pointing out Suzie got the drive because of Toto's influence as a shareholder, not because Williams is a customer team for Merc. 

Her first test with Williams was when Williams are still using Renault. 




 Son Goku 









 He was McLaren's test driver during his DTM years, so it's not like he has no single seater experience 




 Actually Toto has a stake in Williams

Torger Christian "Toto" Wolff[1] (born January 12, 1972 in Vienna, Austria) is an Austrian investor and racing driver who is currently a 30% Owner and Executive Director of Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula One Team and *a shareholder in Williams F1 of which he owns just under 5% in shares.*
 




 Corey Graves is doing this with Becky Lynch on NXT. One of my favourite thing because he hates her for no reason  




 the banking means that you would need minimal steering when you use the karousel and if you time it just right, it will spit you out in a straight path. 

I always use that during online races where new drivers would use the upper non banking section and I would just swoop through and overtake them. There is a LOT of time to be gained there

A (not really clean) lap from me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N06vsYwNyB4 




 I kinda understand what he's coming from really. LU feels like a Spanish Soap Drama with awesome wrestling. 

The way the promos are packaged, the video work, the cuts, it feels like watching a TV drama instead of a wrestling show. There is no Kayfabe or suspension of reality since you know it's just a tv drama.

Maybe that's why Cornette hates it due to his old school way. 




 If 100% of the people using mobile phone in the world uses smartphone, yes. 

But since not everyone is, hence the logic is still Call -- Timeout -- Voicemail. Everything is standardised, no matter what phone you use and no matter what country you use that phone in 




 Hmm

I'd say the heavier, brushless motor means that you have a better control on your steering (no more gear meshing feeling) and you will get better road feedback as well

Also the stock rim that comes with the set feels awesome and robust 




 any game that supports directdevice should work with the wheel. I've even used it for Formula 1 Championship 99-02

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEVf0B2Lrfc 




 Well if I would have to compare them in Laymen's term

T300RS - McLaren P1

G27 - Nissan GTR

Microsoft Wheel - Suzuki Wagon R.

And yes, the extra that you pay for it are worth it.  




 I agree, except the for your second paragraph. They do not "pick" Project Cars, they were chosen by the developers to help with the handling and give feedbacks. 

There are no perfect simulators out there and I doubt there ever will be. Hence why I just race and have fun on them all.

 Imagine if he debuts with the Big Show's music

Wellll!! Well it's the Big Joe! It's the Big Bad Joe toniiight!~ 




 I don't think Pirelli could bring that much tyres. They would have to pick a tyre in a certain amount of time before a race so that Pirelli could handle the logistics

 Being a real life Batman 




 I was racing online at Bathurst last night. I was on pole, and was looking forward to a clean race since the other guys were fast on the straights, but my car was fast on the twisty bits, hence I would be out of harm's way when cars thread the needle on the top of the hill

But it turned into a sham quickly. At the start, the guy in third jumped the start, and hit me. Not only that I have now a broken car, I ALSO have deemed to jumped the start, even tho it was not my fault. 

As I trundled along avoiding the mass accident on top of the hill as I expected to happen, I pitted, sure to be able to challenge for some consolation places. 

But due to the auto pit exit, the bloody game said that I cut the corner when exiting the pits. And I have a bloody 1 MINUTE penalty. 1 minute! How the bloody developers think that 1 minute is a good penalty for corner cutting?

Now that I have lost a lot of time for that penalty, I have to pit for a second time to fix my car, and I thought the first penalty was my own fault, so I slammed on the brakes before the manual control was handed back to me when I exit the pit lane. But lo-behold! I was given ANOTHER BLOODY 1 MINUTE PENALTY.

TL;DR: Corner cutting is buggy, and the penalty should be lessen to 5 seconds 




 Depends on the racing series. Most FIA sanctioned race will penalise the driver that ignores the blue flags three times.

 Because Steph, as with Hunter is a fitness freak. Both of them even have a fitness video.

Shane meanwhile has not been working out for a while, and i doubt he could work in the ring anymore unless he starts back from basic 




 do you have anything smaller?

 watched that Wrestle 1

Goldberg entering one changing room, and exiting another

Altho I'm more sorry to see them retire KroniK.  




 Years of experience. Really. You'd develop like a 6th sense via adjusting where would the guy be in relative to you. Audio cues also helps 









 WWE is like reality TV drama with wrestling in it

Lucha Underground is like Wrestling with fake spanish soap opera in it

Others are wrestling with story if they feel they need it 




 Yep. For me it's HUD with mirrors, HUD without mirrors, no HUD, and then telemetry in that order whenever I cycle the HUD button in the cockpit 




 Last time I did a 12 hour endurance race in the old GTR game. After the race, I have a fever, was really nauseous and my eyes won't focus for an hour after that.

10/10 would do again 




 Goldberg is a poor man's Gillberg 




 Try moving the brake balance forward a bit. I set the brake balance at 64% forward on the Formula A car and I rarely locks now.  




 Yep. Hence why I usually brake and coast now instead of slamming on the brakes as hard as I can. Hard to do when a maniac behind just slam into you instead of trying to outbrake me :/ 




 I hope the tag match would be ala War Games, one by one a tag partner is released in teh ring 




 Depends. IIRC McMahon was furious when Punk and Cena did that spot, and the only reason they got away with it was that they were the top two guys at the time. 

 




 New Jack. Easily one of the most hated guy out there
He does not really loves wrestling. He just loves hurting people  




 Holy shit. I totally dig that guitar riff for Bork 




 I only bought it because I don't have consoles, and 2K15 is the first for the PC for a while.

Honestly tho they should ditch Yukes!. The lack of wrestlers were supposedly due to "storage limitation" but I blame Yukes! on still being stuck on last gen console mentality for that. Storage are cheap nowadays, and not everything should only be stored on the DVD/Blu-Ray. But that's Japanese developers for you 




 Brundle drove the Force India and found out first hand how difficult the modern cars are compared to the ones years before 




 Can't seem to adjust the brake balance in the car. I've been locking the rears on the Formula A and usually I would shift the brake balance forward for corners that i have this issues. but it does not seem to work as my rear keeps on locking. 

Manually shifting teh brake balance in the pits works, but then I would have an overheating problem as I can't shift the brakes to the rear.

Anybody else having this problems? 




 Sepang 




 Yep. just found out about this in accident last night. My sweetspot is 10. 




 I think it calculate the number of people clicked/searched for the particular show rather than the show that are shown on the network itself 




 Sepang will usually offer cheap tickets a year in advance too, hence making them even cheaper

 How is Tamina related to the Ano'ai? through her mom? Because IIRC Snuka is not related to them 




 Has he changed his style in TNA? I mean he was famous for being sloppy in WWE, but has he turned for the better in TNA? 

Never saw his match in TNA, well basically TNA in general as it's not shown in my country, so i'm legit curious 




 It was badly executed, I'll give you that. And once he won you knew what the main event for WM is 




 Uhaa-man will win it away from Hooah-man! 




 It's called Kanji and both Japanese and Chinese use them 




 What /u/cookiebombers meant was turn one was specifically tight. Too tight for any racing cars IMO. It's like a mini hairpin. if they had shorten the barriers, I think it would have been much better  




 An interesting fact about the last Monday Nitro, Road Dogg, who was released from WWE due to drugs, was at Panama City trying to get a job with WCW that day. He was surprised to see Shane McMahon there instead

 It's because they used her for the whole taping session, which is why she seems to be on every episode. 

And you she needs the exposure. You don't become good from just hiding behind the scene. She might not be good now. but in time with enough experience she would 




 err I did this because I wanted to use only 240 degrees

 Also you can cheat the degree of rotation here. rotate until you see your DESIRED degree of rotation, and hold it there 




 You get the pack from pre-order 




 Just a thought, but is Jamie Noble and Joey Mercury are now MORE over as J J than when they were active wrestlers? 









 Happened to me last night. I had to uninstall Logitech Profiler to make it work. 

 




 Option - Control - Calibrate Wheel at the bottom

here: https://youtu.be/0K6Aiiz8RN4?t=1158 




 Wheel calibration menu? I set mine at 240 there 




 No assist here. Brakes feels okay. The default setting for every car is 90% brake pressure, hence even if you are stomping the pedal your car is only using 90% brakes. It might be to help newer drivers not to lock their brakes? Try changing it to 100% 




 I was listening to music during the game downloading session and I forgot to pause it when I ran the game

It was this song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GVIMWt8q2Q 




 Also some of this short reign were in Russo years where they need something to get viewers to watch their product. Title Changes were the easiest hook

Testing Project Cars for teh first time. Default graphic settings on a GTX970 @1080p. FPS counter on top left

Must say it looks good 




 For some reason when I checked the system log for the game it states

Nvidia SLi false
AMD Crossfire false

I am using 970 SLi. So yeah. It does not detect my SLi

 




 They are being courted by ROH (long term contract), LU (for season 2) and TNA (big contract) as reported by Wrestling Observer Newslette 




 Had some issues with Logitech Profiler and Project Cars. When the game starts, apparently Logitech Profiler (running in background) would crash, and restart. This will lead to the game being forced back to the foreground. In some rare cases, the game would not show up even if you click on the icon on the taskbar

Solutions:

If you are using logitech peripherals like controller and steering wheel, run the game in Windowed mode. 

Either that or uninstall Logitech Profiler altogether if you're not using any Logitech peripherals 














 Currently I am taking "TNA is dead" with a grain of salt. It's like a new meme of wrestling. 

With the report that they are talking to Young Bucks, I don't think their position is that bad. Not making as much as they would like, yes, but not as bad as people are making them to be. 

 




 All I can think of is "That would definitely fail side impact crash test" 









 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzmI3vAIhbE 




 I would accept it if it's just for a special show, not if it's used for every match.

Most wrestling matches are built up slowly to that crescendo, that apex if you will. And the moves, such as signature and/or finisher is a guide for the viewers.  




 The only thing I hate about it is the upper orange/red swoosh on the nose make the nose looks like it has two section, ala the old stepped nose. 




 They should have made Ambrose vs Rollins match last. by the time Orton vs Reigns was up, i stopped watching knowing they can't top any other segments of the night 




 I read that at "#perverse" for some reason  




 Not me. Newer cars have those sleeker looking profile  




 Their Iron Man match in FCW was awesome as well 




 Rene Rast uses Project Cars for training and track learning

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCZ41aHyZhwgVt3aBYxquSQ

 




 rFactor solved this years ago IMO by not having any pit crew animation, and you have to target a red box in your pit box. A good driver could save loads of time attacking the pit lane  




 which should be easy. WMD forums would be full of custom skins next week 




 Foley winning the World Title the first time. We only had Monday Night Raw in my country at the time, and it was pre internet days so nobody knows the results in advance. 

Also the night when Jericho beats HHH for the world title in RAW. Fuck the ending where he has to give back the belt tho 




 They were part of Back Street Krew, which makes sense 




 IIRC Rikishi was with the Undertaker's group of backstage enforcers, the Back Street Krew 









 Prost was Ligier, which was quite a good midfield team. And they were never backmarkers. 

Prost and Panis could, and should have better results, but Panis never did show all the promise he had before his nasty accident, and Prost was never a good team boss.  














 Depends. The reason it would work in WEC is because the top teams are all factory teams, each running three cars, and each are backed by a powerful car company budget. 

The same rule in F1 would quickly kill of the non works team that are struggling like Sauber and Marussia. And remember, the 3 car per team idea was also floated in F1 but quickly shot down by fans themselves. 




 As a Malaysian they also have cheaper price for Local students. Some fans recycle their old university card to get in cheaper 




 your explanation made me realise why they changed to rumblestrips instead of painted concrete sidewalk kerbs years ago 




 Ironically if not for Nando's toy throwing tantrum, McLaren would have comfortably win the 2007 WCC if not of they being thrown out of the championship for constructors 




 24 hour race car, which I think is a LMP1 car for all intent and purposes. Lego took some liberty I think. But I like it due to I can modify it with my own remote control and lego engine with minimal change. 

The generic F1 car model is awesome due to the pushrod suspension, something that actually worked well and made it easy for me to explain how F1 suspension works to other people 




 Hmm Naomi and Cameron looks to have normal body size, as well as Emma. 

But seriously she does seem to be thinner as you said 




 Also they have backstage duties as well. Producers I think? Wrestling means they would have less time fore their real jobs 




 I just realised that Paige actually has a hot body but her current costume makes her look slim 




 It's actually an easy way for the drivers to locate the apex of the corner, hence why they are everywhere, even at street circuits 




 Depends. Some of the drivers who grew up in the Senna era like Alonso and Hamilton actually wanted to drive for McLaren rather than Ferrari 




 I am 30 and I also love Lego

 All broadcasters have streaming option IIRC. Fox in Asia have Fox Sports Play. NBC has their own streaming, altho according to people here it's a bit laggy, and most of the people who get the Sky broadcast is using NowTV. 

In fact, for Fox, while the TV only shows the race, for the online stream the have dedicated onboard and pitlane stream as well 




 I tried to get into the site after the race started. I can't due to all the traffic. still needs a long way to go before it's a feasible pay option 




 0 lap gap, but how many seconds? 




 streamup is horrible once it get a lot of viewers. Try using gaminglive.tv as alternative 




 Or he could slowly loose all of his eccentric character, and by the end of his run, have a looser retire match against his brother. At the end, he's no longer goldust, and lost as Dustin, passing the torch of the bizzare character to his brother 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0F2Gu3GGqw 




 Less family friendly but not as hardcore as ECW or even during Attitude Era.

To be honest with all the incidents and death in wrestling after the Monday Night Wars have ended, they (the wrestling industry as a whole) realised that they need to tone down most stuffs for the benefit of the wrestlers themselves 




 time and money constraint I would think. they took an existing nose and front wing assembly and modified it 




 It's a Malaysian plane bound to Malaysia with a whole lot of Malaysian families. It was like when JBL did the Nazi salute in Germany. 

Yes, we know you are a heel, but there are something you can't do.  














 God. I am sorry. I meant old in the context of this game vs the latest (well on the PC for me) 2K15. 





























 Usually someone will take the podcast and host it somewhere else. so the plug is usually for those cases

 Legit Shoot WWE2K match where the match are legit, but wrestlers are playing on the XBOne instead of in the ring using their own characters 




 Hitbox.tv and Gaminglive.tv are honestly better and faster than twitch. But yeah, once you found out how to use Youtube, you would never want to go back  




 - More CDN across countries, like for me in Asia, this is waaay smoother than Twitch
- Silky smooth Google connections
- Everyone has a youtube app on their phone, you don't need to install a third party app to view it
- Monetization. 
- All of your streams are archived, and encoded by Youtube automatically

There are a few kinks (I feel that they could make this easier for game streamers, right now it's targeted for people who are doing things like concert and such) but IMO once you get the hang of it, it's miles better than twitch 




 Twitch has too much traffic streaming along it's stream, hence for people like me that lives in far flung regions (I live in Asia) it induces stutters and lags. 

Some people solves that using Ghostery but I rather use Youtube right now 




 I love Matt Striker's "This moment has just become an instant classic"  tho.  









 I just realised your edit. Sorry mang :/ 









 You mean Broadcasting? The built in broadcasting is good if you're only streaming to one or two people. For more people, it would be better to use an ingest server in between so you're not wasting your bandwith 




 You can embed it without the chat on your site, and use your own chat box like from chatango or a JS IRC box 









 Oh god, you reminded me of an online race I had on rFactor years ago at Valencia. penalties and start accident meant I was 15s behind 3rd place, and after the last pitstop I was catching him lap by lap. I was so in the zone and like in a trance. And my roommate had to tap me on the shoulder and ruin it all :/ 




 Audio out of sync? 









 She meant "Perfect" 




 The new ones are made from painted wood I think.  




 Rumours are he's turning heel this Sunday.

But honestly, I am so hyped about the matches that I did not even care he's included or not in the first place. He was not in the Raw after Payback (with Randy) and was blended into the background as Ambrose and Rollins take the spotlight for the last two weeks, and it kinda worked.  




 That guitar riff at the start always reminds me of Benoit's entry riff.

 LU is a Telenova with wrestling in it. Completely different from WWE which is wrestling with drama in it.

There is no suspension of reality, since, well, you know it's a telenova. so just sit back and enjoy the ride.

But if you enjoy kayfabe that is spliced with real life, then it maybe hard to get into LU  




 For an easier comparison, this is like Wrestlemania 3. Everybody WANTS to see Andre vs Hogan, but Savage and Steamboat stole the show 




 Maybe the shorter time for editing? Smackdown for me looks like it uses the "Live" style of RAW, where they just edit the show as it goes. Make sense as they need to send the tapes to international market a day after it's taped 




 There were only three times that the German anthem were not played last year. Guess when that was 




 FIA/FOM has the feed for all the cars during the race. I'm sure something as controversial as this would have been released by the FIA/FOM to help gather more viewers to F1 




 And he has to handle 

1 - Singapore Media

2 - Malaysian Media (X2 one on one)

3 - Regional (South East Asia) Media

Each would need a special answer and know how for their culture and WWE's individual reach in that country, so Dolph needs to be briefed about that first. Totally more hectic than the schedule makes out

 F1 broadcasters that elect to use English commentary are provided with SkyF1's commentary by the FOM, except for USA which does their own broadcast 









 I think a Reigns heel turn would be much more interesting. The crowd is still 50/50 on Reigns, and he's not Cena who is the appointed Superman and won't turn heel.

Heck, he might turn out to be as charismatic as the Rock given a heel turn.  




 Big Van Vader is one and he has an illustrious career as a heavy wrestler that moves like a lightweight. 




 WWE sometimes acknowledge ROH on TV, but it's rare. This is usually in return for ROH letting WWE using their footage for documentary and such

Interestingly they acknowledge the  IWGP belt that Lesnar won, so they kinda acknowledge NJPW in general

 Actually NXT is the sum of a lof of contributers. Never pin down NXT's success or growth to one man, because it's not. And I don't think anyone down in NXT would want to either

HHH, Regal, Dusty, Terry Taylor, Norman Smiley, Steve Keirn, Gerald Brisco, Del ray, and a lot more contributed to the growth and the high quality product that we are seeing today.  




 Leva was not even wrestling under any names. She was supposedly a no name jobber to Carmella. Ironically she was the one that caught people's eye 




 For any South East Asian? Rice. We ate rice for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and some students who were sent overseas even went sick when they can't find rice to cook there

The reason we are not sick of rice is because it can easily be eaten with anything. Fried meat, gravy, veggies, heck if you're out of money even soy sauce would do 




 Depending on the tracks IMO. The first corner for watkin glens for example can be taken on it's entirety off track without penalty. so some corners are more strict than others

One thing for sure tho, Spa and Bathurst have bugs where if you pit, you will be given a penalty when exiting the pit lane which makes no sense as the car is auto controlled by the game

 My G25 was the first generation G25 and the first one to be brought in Malaysia by a friend of mine. He already had it 3 years before selling it to me and it's still working til today.  




 P Cars has shitty DRS animation. I had mine opening mid corner for some reason even tho it's off 




 They harvest energy under heavy braking. That is why even now there are times when a car goes for a fast lap with Kers, do a fast lap without to recharge and do another one with Kers again

 Depends. A little traction control would help the car going out of a slow corner

Interestingly I think it was the first year of "legal" traction control where Hakkinen turned his off and immediately took pole in Spain.

The best I could do for now is a 1:20. Lot more time to be found tho. I still yet to soften the suspension  and increase diff lock.

But the hardest thing is in real life, Monaco is lapped with a super soft tyre. PCars only has one tyre compound and it's suited for every circuit so that means it's harder than what  you would use in real life, hence slower 




 god. Will be a while to wait til December :/

 This happened with Hamilton at Sepang last year. He pitted in the lead and Hulkenberg inherited the lead, but Hulkenberg pitted before he completed that lap, so Hamilton was still considered to be the leader for that lap and got the Grand Chelem 




 It was banned before the race. But people forgot that it was not only McLaren but also other teams like Jordan were using the same thing. Only McLaren was caught.

Ron Dennis was so smug when the team easily won without the system

I'll try upload the 1998 season review if you want to know more

 MOTHERFUCKING Owens came out in The Champ is Here shirt. That was a so awesome heel move that I clapped 




 TNA Friday Nights on the WWE Network! 




 Kayfabe wise, true. but in reality Sami is far from healed, and he needs a storyline rest. They already lost Hideo so they can't lost him in the main event, especially after weeks of anticipation. EVERYONE wanted to see this main event. And WWE gave it. I have no complaint 




 The ending makes sense non-Kayfabe wise

Sami is certainly still working injured. He needs a longer off time and in the meantime, they need another top level face since Hideo is also out for 8 to 6 months. They have already plans for Uhaa to debut slowly, so why not get one of the most hottest property right now to debut and take over Zayn/Hideo's role?

This is awesome 




 Might be like KENTA when he first came. They changed the name later 




 I just realised that WWE uses a different Kanji for Hideo. Hideo uses  (Eiyu - Hero) as his twitter handle. WWE uses  instead for the shirt 




 I'd be more happier if they keep the DRS as in real life, AKA there are sections and special event before you can trigger the DRS. Makes no sense when everyone can use DRS on every straight as it takes out the real use of DRS

Also does anybody notice the animation for DRS is wonky? Some cars have DRS open mid corners, while at Catalunya the animation does not work at all, showing the DRS is open permanently 




 The 458 Italia is actually recognised in windows as an XboX 360 Controller. Try plugging it in a friend's PC and see if that works?

Also check out Devices and Printers 




 Monza, Le Mans and Nordchleife has long straights. Just need to have a good exit at the corner beforehand to reach maximum speed 




 Took me a while after RAW finished to realised neither were there.  




 Thank you! They should have made it more clear tho :/ 




 Was wondering if this can be done. Currently when you create a pit strategy you MUST take in fuel. This means for short sprint races where you just want to fix something and change tyres, waiting for fuel makes no sense. 




 Force feedback is broken, and now it feels twitchy and oversteery 




 They have an agreement with Full Sail to teach students using NXT about TV production. So the once a month taping at Full Sail is there to stay 




 won't be that bad. Remember, NXT tapes a month of matches in advance

 Hamilton should have been a winger

Weird that he does not join this after his Arsenal vs Sky match 




 Kinda
He thought i hit him from behind so i told him to save the replay 




 We both underestimated that corner. talking to him after the race, he thought I was behind, and not beside him, hence the door closing quickly.  




 Yes.  









 Combined pedals means that the game detect your pedal and brakes as one X axis controller, with the fuel +X and the brakes -X.

This means that you can't really press them both at the same time as only one is detected. This is actually a patch for old games that can't detect fuel and brakes as separate controls 




 Considering that 230ish = 370KM/h which F1 cars could only acheive at Monza but rarely, I'm amazed they are complaining the cars are still slow

 Bathurst too  has this pit exit bug 




 If you notice that McLaren has a grudge on me since the first corner up to the hairpin where he took me out  




 No worries man. I actually find this funny. If you see what I was doing was holding back and still I got spun out  









 Started following F1 when it was held in Malaysia in 99. While technically the internet exist, it's still in it's infancy and you have to go to a cybercafe to use it, which is costly to me. 

Thankfully every Sunday there is a cars special slip out section in our newspapers, and Mobil One sponsors a 10 page F1 spreadout in  it. So I collected that. And since Mobil One sponsors McLaren, it also has special features on Mika and DC

I remember watching races delayed, and I would turn off all radio and TV news before watching them.  




 The noise in your image shows that 

1 - Auto ISO bumped to max

2 - Rather slow shutter speed

3 - WWE does the opposite for their broadcast

 PC only tho :/ 




 The control mapping option was created with the PC in mind (remember, it was supposed to be a PC only game) which with the keyboard, you have a lot of keys to assign these functions to.

 I am in Asia but I changed my region to either London or Manchester. Lots of Europeans. Note that weekends would be full of new drivers that might be too aggressive in defending 




 Cockpit. Also remember, you could adjust your seat if you feel that the view is too high/low 




 or maybe his mom or wife messaged him. There is a whole lot of reason for a person to not ignore a message 




 The Authority will be around at least until the next WM where likely Rock and Rousey puts an end to them. so yeah, happy days are here again 




 I'm convinced that's Kimi doing commentary 




 Also by editing the configuration files you can even race with the safety car. Awesome stuffs 




 A lot of games have the same game/physics engine by ISI. rFactor, rFactor 2, GTR, GTR2, the Brazillian based Stock Car Extreme and even NFS Shift 1 and NFS Shift 2.
