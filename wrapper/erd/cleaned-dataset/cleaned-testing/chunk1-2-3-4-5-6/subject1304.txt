 For me it's not the movie itself, it's the general atmosphere I can't stand anymore. People playing candy crush the whole film, or on their phones the whole movie, etc... 





























 Whatever happened to this series? Do the arcade elements not translate to modern consoles anymore?  




 More choices. I love that video games are becoming more like movies, but the reason I love video games is that YOU control the plot and story. 




 Safe. It's a bizarre film where Julianne Moore gets "20th Century Disease". Basically it causes her to mysteriously break out in sores and have seizures due to certain chemicals and fumes like car exhaust. Nobody understands why she is having these ailments and the film is full of these sterile, long static shots that make you feel uncomfortable.

 How the mighty have fallen... 




 ANTHING by Mikhail Kalatozov. The Cranes are Flying, I am Cuba, Letter Never Sent. Just youtube anything from I am Cuba and you will be blown away! 
























 Knack. People gave it polarizing opinions but it's a fun beat-em-up with pixar style art style. 




 Dawn of the Dead (the original) 




 Pee Wee's Big Adventure. Not much of a plot, full of funny scenes, and perfect for kids and nostalgic adults  
























 Annie Hall 




 I would carry a turret through Nova Prospect as long as it didn't get knocked outta my hand.  





























 Can't recall if Robocop has a beginning title screen, but it has an awesome end title screen 




 Jerry Maguire...actually ANYTHING from Cameron Crowe.  




 The Killing- Such a great late noir/heist movie and with so many great actors. Sterling Hayden scares me with his delivery of lines and his cold, stone face.
