 Did it leave a mark on your gloves? 




 Exactly what I was thinking. Considering how "hurt" his reaction was...that bite should have left a mark on the glove. 




 I just saw the video of Mayweather saying Maidana bit him. Personally, I don't think it was true and just some lousy Mayweather tactic. Anybody can prove this is possible? (wearing a mouth guard...hands with a wrap and gloves)

 Tamara, you should be proud. You saved a couple that would have likely drowned were it not for your courage. Not many others might have succeeded as you did in such a dangerous situation.
