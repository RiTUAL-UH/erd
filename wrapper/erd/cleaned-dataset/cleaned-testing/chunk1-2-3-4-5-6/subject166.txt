  http://www.netrootsnation.org/  I went 4 years ago and had a great time.   


































 This interview made me very anxious.  The interviewer sounds very reasonable.  How did Simpson get appointed to this committee?  And wouldn't it be great to have an intelligent interview with a committee member? 














 I'm a liberal, but this is getting too much for me.  Is it time that we "ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country." 

















































 My laptop picked up some virus on reddit last November.  There was a post on it at the time, but it was already too late.  If I remember right, it was not in windows or directly in reddit.  Now, I have to unplug my computer and remove the battery almost every time (not always, but most times) I boot up.  Does anyboy remember this and know how I can fix it.  I would appreciate any advice on this. 




















































































































































































































































 I told them I was a Democrat voting for Obama, but I am still getting thier robo calls! 




 The original was one of National Geographic's most memorable photos. 




 I posted the Guide as it can be helpful, particularly in nonpartisan judges races when you don't know who they are. 









 http://nevadavoterguide.com/
This is the progressive guide. 




 I guess when Republicans were crying about voter fraud, they were talking about  their own members.  I haven't heard or read of one incident by Democrats, but have read about destroying ballots in mulitple states. 




 How about government which doesn't create jobs, but Romney will create 12 million jobs as President? 




 I saw my niece's photo yesterday volunteering in a Romney campaign hdqtrs.  She had two children under medicaid, although she is now married to the father. 




 Harry Reid is a Democrat and a Mormon.  I know other Mormon Democrats. 




 Want to come to my house?  My pool needs replastering and repair! 




 Romney is Bush on steroids. 




 I'm watching CNN now stating Romney won.  Drives me crazzzzzyyyy. 




 I have a friend who is a CPA AND is an Oracle programmer.  Travels everywhere she wants. 




 That I could have done better. 




 I love you Paul Krugman. 




 Wow.  A lot of comments!  A co-worker and I discussed it.  We would offer $1 million to each co-worker who would walk away with us that day. 




 1890 or 1990? 




 I like that. 




 They also didn't want the economy at that time. 




 Yes, it is one more form of corporate welfare.  People need a living wage. 




 Wow.  I appreciate you summarizing it like this. 




 I been doing that for 40 yrs.  Getting too tired.  Just hope others can take over in greater numbers. 




 I agree, and their sleasiness. 




 I haven't read the article, but there is still too much talk about the grand deal.  We need to change the premise first. 




 Who would have thought Bush would win a second term?  Yes, these guys will stop at nothing.  Did you read the article about Bain owning the company that supplies a lot of the voting machines? 




 The existing super rich will end up with it ALL. 




 JFK, RK and MLK assassinations, and who was behind the plot to overthrow FDR. 




 You are so right.  Now, how do we convince others? 




 This is common.  The Post Office is a good example.  Congress voted them to keep 70 years (or 80, I don't remember the details) in retirement funds, which meant they would not have enough money to operate today.  Then they blame the PO mgmt for not being able to meet today's expenses. 




 Didn't the last guy who was going to testify about the 2004 presidential race in Ohio die? 









 And I can't even get some of my closest friends or family to see. 









 i am so tired of them, and their baby-like tantrums. 









 I used to play Diplomacy, but you need 6-8 people to play and it can be a long game. 




 Awesome view.  You can see five mountains lined up out the window.  I got a photo too, but was on a clear day with blue skies. 




 It is my biggest scare.  I don't have a choice though - Romney who promises cuts to SS, and Obama who has shown indication to deal with the republicans on this issue.  The last time there was a ss compromise was a disaster for some of us.  I'm looking at my future ss cut of $400 due to the last agreement.  What will they do this time? 




 Doesn't matter.  There are still enough people to vote for him no matter what he says or what his policies are. 






























































































































































































































































 I see these ads that you can build your own panels from factory seconds.

 It's a fun day trip to continue on from the date farm to Tecopa, Shoshone and then Death Valley. 




 A swimming pool.  I've had it empty for the last 6 years now because it costs too much to have it refinished,  and I'm concerned about the extra water and utility use with global warming.   




 I know.  I've been waiting my whole life. 
























 Years ago, we had a welfare march in my town to protest some of the policy decisions from our state that cut many people off the rolls.  There was also an anti-welfare march to support those policy decisions.  I later met the leader of the anti-welfare march.  He had had a heart attack, his wife left him, and he lost his house.  He was trying to get legal assistance when I met him.  It could happen to any of us.  Oh, and by the way, I just wish I would hear as much complaining about corporate welfare which probably surpasses all of the welfare programs - and generally ends up in just a few pockets. 




 You are right.  I meant cheaper to make. 




 If men and women make up that 60%, half would be 30%. 




 I love this! 




 I hurt for the younger generations, but I'm not sure that is the answer.  I want those programs there for them also. 




 Of course, I know what percent of taxes people pay.  Did you know that the top rate use to be 90%?  Money has been devalued on purpose!  I saw the head of the manufacturer's lobby on c-span during the Bush administration saying that was their goal.  They want goods to be cheap enough for Americans to afford them.  They also want to pay less for wages.  The bottom 45% pay a higher percentage of their wages in payroll taxes.  I think the low-income tax credit was a subsidy to businesses to be able to pay low wages to workers and still make huge profits.  I think in a sense that is what the Obamacare is also - a subsidy to companies like Wal-Mart who do not want to pay for health care for thier workers.  So we were all paying for it anyway, at hospital emergency rooms.  I worked at Welfare and saw the flyers Wal-Mart was giving to thier employees to go apply for medicaid.  What is right about that?  There is another submission I saw on Reddit today that says poor people get the same amount of GDP as do the rich in terms of tax benefits.  Found it:  http://www.reddit.com/tb/15di1o
 And contrary to some people's believes, the rich are not job creators.  It is only a race to the bottom.  We do better as individuals and as a country when we are all doing well, not just a few. 




  I hurt for the younger generations and we need to do what we can to help them, but at the risk of starving seniors?  We have enough for everyone.  Right now, corporation's chairmans and Presidents of their boards are walking away with all of the corporate profits.  Corporations have one goal:  profits, not the improvement of society or their workers.  



 




 You are making the assumption that it is all the fault of social security and medicare.  We have been spending a billion a week for years on a war.  Social security isn't even a part of the budget.  Boomers paid 110% more than they should have to cover the costs of social security.  Americans LOVE those programs and will pay for them.  This has been a plan by republicans to starve the beast - and get rid of those programs. 




 Yep. 




 You needed the spending to avoid a huge depression.  They used to call government spending "priming the pump", when private enterprise is not spending, government needs to spend.   It didn't cost much in interest rates.  Republicans screamed about the deficit during Clinton years - and poof - it was gone in no time when everyone went to work.  It is higher now, and it will stay high through the boomer's retirement, but it is not so excessive as to break the county.  Wiki "the two-santa theory".  Large Federal spending has been historically higher under republicans.  They don't mind big-government, they just mind big-government money being spent on regular people.  They love the military and contracting with private enterprise.  We can go off the cliff, then the republicans can vote for a tax-break for 90% of the people, just not the rich. 




 Nice photo. 




 I would like to believe you are right, but I know so many crazys! 




 There are some translating companies also. 




 How about first making employees full-time.  Too many now have part-time jobs. 




 I will have to watch it.  Saw her on C-Span and she was great. 




 Yeah, let's help the corporations. Screw the people. 









 It's wierd submitting a reddit article to a subreddit! 









 Diplomacy puts Risk to shame, but you need 5-7 players, and lots of time. 




 Remember, George Bush was a cheerleader when many students were protesting the war,  And Romney was leading protests for the war.  There were two kinds of boomers. 




 isn't that how we all got started? 




 Apply online at the mgmcareers.com.  They are the major employer on the strip.  Who knows.  People do get hired.  I also know a woman who recruits for them also, normally low-paying jobs like guestroom attendents.  Mail me your resume and I'll get it to her.  She may be able to chek out if they ever hire on HIB visas, or whatever. 




 I'm so impressed.  Wish I could do this.  




 I remember Nixon's people calling him "Ain't no Way". 




 I've been wondering, if people love medicare   social security, rather than cut them, let's pay a little more for them -- with the condition that Congress can't spend the money on anything else. 




 I can't believe he is a supreme court judge.  I heard him quoting Fox News during the health care case - and he was wrong about it!  An idiot. 




 I think it is funny. 




 Congrats.  I get about 40 lbs, then breakdown, gain it back.  How do you keep going? 




 They have limitless money and they never stop.  Ethics mean nothing. 




 Escargo. 




 I wrote a term paper 40 yrs on the end of work.  We are in a transition needing less people to do more.   Check this out:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Work 




 Thank you for your thoughts. 




 I'd like to read the article! 




 I'm so tired of these boys.  Just go away..... 




 nice. 









 I'm curious too.  The areas look beautiful. 




 I keep thinking of Linda Tripp, the civil servant who screwed Monica Lewinsky and Clinton.  She was offered a much better job but without civil service benefits or protections.  She took it and a year later, was laid off.  I think this job was to entice DeMint to leave.  And he will be pushed out of his new job in a year. 




 Good luck! 




 What was your original industry?   









 I'm torn.  There is a side of me that says "You vote these guys in office, you deserve what you get".  The problem is that we all pay for it. 




 Idiot. 




 Is there a Veteran's sub-reddit?  This needs to be posted there. 









 The corporate scam, yes.  But wouldn't it be cool if we could all have it. 









 When is she up for election? 




 At one time, I build my own solar heater for my pool.  Just coiled black flexible pvc pipe on my patio roof and ran a hose through my skimmer.  The water pumped through the pipes, heated the water which flowed back into the pool.  The water in the pool was almost too hot in the summer. 




 It is totally corporate-controlled by state statute.  A co-worker had it installed on his home at an upfront cost of $50,000 (probably close to the value of my house).  He got a $15,000 rebate from NV Energy which was the exact charge of installation (and he turned it over to the installers).  I found a group online in suburban Washington D.C. was able to start a co-op with an average cost of $1,500 per house.  You can't do that here without a change in legislation.  I would be up to working on this with people who want the law changed, and have just recently started to talk with people about it.  By the way, my co-worker pays $8/mo now. 




 Do you re-register for the general election? 




 Here comes our corporate court! 




 Important point. 




 And they have a history at stopping at nothing to get what they want. 




 I still love his movies, particularly the funny ones. 




 Good luck!  It's my 40th, and it's hard to believe I am this old! 




 Beautiful! 




 You can do white boards too - like you would see in a corporate office. 




 You can buy blackboard paint that works the same way. 




 It's fun.  Has a lighted canapy over several blocks.  I hear there is a zip line now.  The strip is more spread out. 














 Didn't Fox buy the History Channel a few years back?  That should be reason enough. 




 I would agree, but they stopped the craziness of the tea party house of the last few years.  TG for the Senate. 




 They treat their employees well.  I spoke with one guy who worked for Costco, left to go into the military.  When he returned, they rehired him,  but kept his pay and seniority as if he had been with them the whole time. 




 I think National Geographic gives grants too. 




 Conspicuous consumption, but beautiful anyway 




 When I was young, we used to take the turn at Glendale going north (off the highway heading to the Valley of Fire and Moapa), and would go to Warm Springs.  In those days, they had three swimming pools open to the public.  I haven't been there in almost 30 years now, and the last time I saw it, one was privately owned, and the other two pools were empty.  I'm not sure what it is like today, but it looks like it is a wildlife area now.
http://www.snwa.com/env/wsna.html
There are petroglyphs at the Valley of Fire. 




 Birthers. 




 Great idea! 




 I typed pubic instead of publc in a newsletter.  Used respectfully rather than respectively in a term paper.  I've done a few more, but these are the most memorable. 




 I missed that, but like it. 









 Management ought to go to jail. 




 It's Thom Hartmann who has a daily tv and radio show. 




 I thought it was a great presentation.  I posted it to economics also. 




 Interesting.   




 Good news! 




 9 and 1/2 weeks.  Loved the movie.  The book was sick and basically, just trash. 




 I wish the workers could take over the company. 
























 I haven't been to BA, but have friends who used to go to Drink Liberally there...http://www.drinkingliberally.com.ar/ 




 They decided on the partisanship the day Obama was inaugurated. 




 Move-0n has the software.  I used it a few years ago in my precinct.  Knew who was registered, who voted daily in early voting so they could be contacted to ensure that they turned out. 









 IrishJoe is right.  http://www.reddit.com/tb/12x9rg 




 It may be 10 years until we win the state houses and then can do our own gerrymandering after the next census. 




 I've never related to the South, but I thought the article was well-developed, sensitive.  I think many older white men have seen the threat of losing their position in society also - with the rise of women in the workforce.  Obama could have appealed to them through populism, but I'm not sure they could accept it.  Thanks for the post. 









 Sleezy. 




 Long live Nate! 




 Yeah, can you imagine the House voting for it? 




 I think I would rather eat than look towards the future.  duh. 




 I received a mailing from the "Catholic Association" yesterday urging me to vote for Romney.  The flyer had 6 thumbs up for Romney, 8 thumbs down for Obama.  I'm not Catholic, but am offended. 




 What happened to those campaign emails they were supposed to release a week or so again? 




 Right. 




 Not this bad, but I noticed it twice in the 70's.  First, the Viet Nam war created a huge divide among the young and the old.  Second, I went to a meeting at the Health Department to promote my grant for a community health center.  The room was packed.  I thought the people there were to comment on my half million dollar grant.  No, they were there to speak against a $10,000 family planning grant.   I was stunned.  I also thought Watergate would end it because it seemed so bipartisan, but it didn't, only made it worse. 




 Nice. 




 Too much work and organization. 




 Will you ever hear this on tv? 




 Good for you!  And welcome to the world of sane voters. 




 http://nvdemselectionnight.eventbrite.com/#
This is the link to the Dems get-together.  It's usually pretty busy.   




 Republicans always get caught doing that they complain most about - I'm thinking about Larry Craig.  LOL. 




 There was also a related article about less work and increasing inequality - a digital Athens.  I think the real question is how do we get income to people who cannot find jobs due to automation. 









 Watch the movie "Same Time Next Year".  Our society is so screwed.  Why can't she love two people at the same time - in different ways.  Enjoy and try to get to the place where you can enjoy your time together, knowing it may never be the way you originally envisioned it. 




 I wrote grants for 25 yrs, but it's been about 15 yrs now, so not sure how much things have changed.  Federal grant mgmt offices used to like my proposals because I followed the instructions.  Lots of grant writers don't.   Look at the RFP (request for proposals).  If you know interest groups involved in the projects, ask them if they have any sample proposals to use as guidelines.   Funders generally tell you what they are looking for - and what information they want from you.  I used to joke that it was a term paper with a budget.  You want to try to make it interesting too; don't make it too dry. 




 How about deep fried twinkies.  Haven't tried them, but hear they are pretty good.
 




 I met a photographer from NG.  He had written at least one book about his career there, which I gave as a gift, so unfortunately, I can't remember his name!  He started out there as an intern and was eventually hired by them. It's been a few years now, but he had worked for them for over 25 yrs.  I think he also had 2-3 covers on the mag.  Sorry, this is the best I can offer! 




 I'll never believe it. 




 One of the Naked Gun movies. 




 Beautiful! 




 Amen. 









 I don't have children, but don't mind paying taxes for schools because it benefits our society as a whole. 




 Except you could not get one vote from any one of them for any bill. 




 I love Bill Clinton but he did a lot wrong because he caved to republicans on important values.  We got the terrible trade bills like NAFTA that offered no worker protection, he signed the bill to get rid of Glass Steagal which paved the way for the crash.  And remember how they harrassed him to death with the special prosecutor, finally impeaching him.  Now, they act like he was a saint. 




 The only way to get a long with the current republican congress is to give them everything they want.  Remember during the republican presidential debate that the question was asked "Would you take a 10 to 1 cut in spending vs tax increase" and they all said they would not accept that.  You can't work with people who don't want to work with you. 




 There are structural problems in the Senate.  You need 60 votes to get anything through.  With  Ted Kennedy being  sick and then dying, the Senate didln't have 60 votes.  Pelosi passed a ton of bills in the House that couldn't pass in the Senate.  Dems are not like Republicans.  It's hard to get 60 Dems in the Senate to agree on anything.  I do think Campaign Finance reform would help.  Both parties are too tied to fundraising, lobbiests. 




 Yeah, and now they love him. 




 I'm envious. 




 He's not on the ballot for another 4 years (Senators have 6-yr terms, not 2-years as in the House).  The Senate has some flaws that make it impossible to govern without a 60 vote majority.  Getting rid of incumbents won't help.  They have learned that term limits only turn government over to lobbiests and bearucrats because they are then the only people who understand the system.  This is not what you want.  You may want to work to change the rules.  I saw an article once (wish I could find it) that it is also possible for the House to be highjacked by a small minority (like the tea party) so the House is unable to get anything done either.  Ideally, you want majorities of the same party in both houses to be able to get things done.   




 I'm sure that is why.  




 You have to vote partisan in Nevada because it is a swing state.  You can afford to give your vote for a real progressive in California! 




 I wish there were more Bernies. 




 I know how you feel.  But trust me, things can get worse.  Many of us saw this with Bush, and look where we are at today.  If you don't live in a battleground state, go for it.  I love most of the small candidates, including Jill Stein and Rocky Anderson.  If you live in a battleground state, you have no choice but to vote for Obama.  It's too critical not to. 




 Romney didn't run for a second term because he had a 31% favorability rating.  Additionally, he vetoed 800 bills passed by the Massachusetts legislature.  I didn't link the stats, but you can find them fairly easily by googling them.  So much for bipartisanship.  We have to end this plutocracy.  Our only hope we change the constitution or find a way out of this pay for play system, and save the middle class.  Otherwise, we will all lose. 




 I thought this was a great interview.  I wish there was more interest here about it.  We have to come up with some new ways of talking about this issue - and how we are going to address the future. 




 I wish they would do something about the Romney connection to voting machines also. 




 And the rant on over-regulation.  What jerks. 




 Sorry, I'm in Las Vegas.  Uncomfortable now using more water too.  My pool has been empty now for 5 years - looks pretty bad though. 




 Not a bad idea! 
























 Nice! 




 I want to do this. 




 I am continually stunned with these folks. 




 Or the anthrax attack. 




 I'd probably buy one of those around-the-world cruises. 




 And still he gets no respect (except from us libs who love him) 




 I was thinking about that yesterday. I would try them! 




 Life is stranger than fiction. 




 There is a rv rental business on Sahara between i15 and the strip where you can rent tent trailers reasonably also, although I have'nt checked them out in a few years. 




 Isn't that a little elitist? 




 I was thinking about this yesterday.  It would definitely get me excited.  Not sure if she could win though.... 









 I think a survey was done one and the Turkish leader Ataturk was ranked highest of all leaders. Sorry, I don't have the time to find it now. 









 I always wonder if he is playing checkers or chess.  I still don't know, but it could screw us if the Republicans finally played ball.  Also, I wish he would use the stage to change the conversation.  No talk about jobs, only the lousy deficit.  No help for Main Street, only more help for Wall Street. 




 Why would you start a war if nobody came? 




 He doesn't seem to learn. 




 I love it. 














 Sick. 




 



The Urban League has a job program for ex-felons.  They also have a list of employers who will hire them.   There are a group of hotels also, but you have to be honest with them upfront.  Jobs are tough for everyone here now though.





 




 Wait until they are all monopolies, and no one has money or capital to compete. 




 That's because you have never listened to her.  She KNOWS what she is talking about.  She is not a wingbat. 




 Wow.   I like the sound of that! 




 Yeah, but military spending doubled after 9-11.  It needs to be cut even more.  We don't need 80+ bases around the world.  We don't need to outspend the rest of the world combined. 




 Apathy. 




 Taxes on the rich were 90% in the fifties, and corporations paid most of the taxes. 









 It happened to me too.  I'm trying to get in the spirit again, but I'm just so tired.  Hopefully, I'll come around soon, and not let it happen again. 




 Now, if they all would vote. 




 I feel like I had this my whole life, but don't consider myself gifted.  As an existentialist, however, I just realized that in the end it doesn't matter anyway. 




 The other person fired during the war was Bill Maher. 



















 Good for you for asking.  I felt like I couldn't look at another salad or another chicken.   I fell off the wagon and gained my weight back, stopped working out, and feel miserable. 




 He is absolutely correct.  The amount of Social Security one receives is also based on your top 30 yrs of earnings - and you need to earn $20,000/year substanial earnings for the year to count more than $0.  I see too many jobs paying minimum wage to $12/hr which will never help to contribute enough earnings for social security.  And comments here are right too, we can never get enough people out to protest.  We have to find a way to get the do-nothings out of congress and keep the good ones. I'm so frustrated too for people - yet alone myself. 




 Sorry about the spelling. 




 And through the constitution, they are structurally given what they need to survive. 









 We have a spending problem. 









 Or too lazy to look up and post.  Thanks from a lazy one. 




 I see people take out of their 401(k)s all the time.  And even when they don't, they can't save enough to carry them through their retirement.  Do you want them to die on the streets? 




 And a good place to harvest profits. 




 I agree.  I also know a Sandy Duncan.  LOL. 




 No, I'm sorry about your mom (my dad died at 48), but that's also how it supports people that live longer too.  I don't believe social security is broken.  It's the best thing we have going.  I'm looking forward to it, and you will be grateful it will be there for you.  It's just that Wall Street wants very badly to get their hands on it. 




 I looked for his website, but it looks like it doesn't exist anymore.  He had a packet of handouts you could buy also for about $15.  I had planned to order it, but never got around to it.  Our universities have been hit so hard that anything out of the ordinary in no longer there.  Sorry!  He did spend a lot of time talking about Mexico, where Americans could go, health care, taxes, etc.  He did cover other areas that are popular with potential expats.  I still think there is a market, but don't know where he went! 




 At least not soon enough for me.  I'm so tired of the tyranny of the minority we know as the right-wing. 














 Good luck.  I'm pulling for you too.  Just wish I had something offer. 




 It's an 8 hr drive from Las Vegas to Reno, and the road is long and boring.  There used to be a billboard on the highway in the fifties that just said "Ain't this monotomous?"  I remember it as a child, and only wish I had a photo of it today.  Your comment reminded me of it. 









 You did good work, and while they were not in my City, I was aware of and supported your efforts - for 30+ yrs.  I also hated that Dems were such wimps. 














 I thought the sequestration would fail due to the lobbyists, so I don't know.  It is interesting though. 




 People invested in stocks until the bubble burst and they lost their investment.  So that is when they started investing heavily in the real estate market (at least there was something real sitting there), and then the housing bubble burst and people lost the value of that also.  SS is the only option that isn't a ripoff.  It's an insurance plan that you pay for 50 years of your labor. 




 I know some people who have used granite tiles - much less expensive - and can be a diy project.   




 I've seen it.  People who think they are deserving, but no one else is. 




 I attended a one-night class through the continuing education program of our university.  I think it cost $59.   The guy who gave it travels through the west coast doing it at different universities.  So, yes, it is possible. 




 That's a better comment than mine. 




 Bradley Manning was trying to OPEN up government and start a conversation.  The Tea Party is trying to CLOSE down the big bad government. 




 I'm not sure if it was the Pew study, but there was a study of who was the Tea Party, and it was discovered that it was the religious right. 




 Good point.  They also met on the day of Obama's first inauguration and decided to fight him on everything.  And they have!  Even their own recommendations for appointments have been fillabustered! 




 I see jobs frequently on usajobs.com for positions for the military. 




 I don't understand the Republican's push for these drug testing bills.  They did it in Florida and less than 3% of the population showed any drugs, less use than the general public.  Somebody has got to be getting big contracts - why else?  It's a huge waste of money.  Somebody, enlighten me. 




 That happens to all of us - it's not just because of our views. 




 You might want to go to PBS and watch the PBS Frontline on 401(k)s.  Nebraska did a 20 yr study and decided that people could never retire on them. 




 I can't believe that I found it.  I knew him through his manager who was named Red (It's been too many years now!)  Saw him box at the Showboat.  I remember the infamous Howard Cossell talking on tv on what a strong boxer he was.  He didn't have the move Ali had, but he could hit.  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._T._Gordon 




 Yeah, but they will blame it on Obama. 




 I hope to visit someday. 




 I really like Ellison. 




 Republicans don't care about budgets.  They just want to dismantle the social safety net. 




 I thought the bristle cone pine in California was the oldest tree.

 He is a part of everything bad that has happened to us in the past 20 years.  His wife was on the Enron Board.  He was the main proponent of ending Glass-Steigel.  The sequester too???? 














 Actually, S.T.Gregg was a Las Vegas boxing champion in the late 70's.  He won the cruiser weight championship. 




 Beale cypher has never been broken, I believe. 









 My friend who has designed over 100 beautiful houses hasn't had a job since the economy crashed. 




 I'd buy from you! 




 Reagan was voted very low in one of these surveys shortly after his administration ended.  Big money came to the rescue to change history. 




 I believe the House just got pay raises too.  Sleazy people. 




 I've read this before.  What I want to know is if there is a hereditary or a DNA basis.  I wonder if it could be based on ancestry. 




 He earned it. 




 They are already on the dole. 




 Right.  Government is subsidizing low wages with foods stamps, medical and TANF, not to mention housing, utility allowance, etc. 









  Congress allows it.  




 Lol. Busted. 




 You are right.   There was a study somewhere that confirmed this.  I wish I had the link to place here. 




 They are actually the religious right, but I think most republicans believe  the same things.  The only ones that don't are the 1% who only believe in the bottom line who have been funding the republicans all along. 




 Thom Hartmann says it the "two Santa Claus theory" and says it was planned that way. 




   He is my favorite person alive.  I'll probably be at work however and will probably miss it. 




 I put $3000 in a 401K in 1990.  It is still worth $3000 today.  For those of you who who don't believe the article, I urge to to check out the Frontline video on PBS.  Nebraska conducted a 20 yr study and came out with the same conclusion.  People will not be able to retire on a 401(k). And Social Security is not a ponzi scheme because we should not run out of workers investing the system.  A ponzi scheme runs out of investors.  I do worry about there being a lack of work permanently as a way to distribute money throughout the society.  If we do not have work, we will all lose and the whole economy will fail, not just social security.  I've spent a lot of years looking at this. 




 I thought they were trying to get rid of "stupid". 




 Work has been a way to distribute money or wealth.  With computerization, there will be less jobs in the future.  We have to find another way to distribute money so people can live.  Not everyone can be an entrepreneur either. 




 I do worry about the "substantial earnings" amount.  It is about $20,000 per year now, and there are too many low-wage earners that are employed 20-30 hrs/week.   




 Privatized, then stolen by Wall Street. 




 Center-left yes. 




 Interesting. 




 Not really.  Nobody pays me to read and respond to reddit articles. 




 You have my vote. 




 We have heard of people being paid to be bloggers on the right.  I see some of the reddit comments and wonder "hmmm, I wonder if this person is paid to say that".  Am I the only person that wonders about this? 




 My husband's uncle told him that it would never be there for him. Well,  my husband worked for 50 years, and guess what, he is receiving it. 




 In a ponzi scheme, you run out of investors.  Social Security has a ready stream of investors (workers paying in to the sytem) and people who either receiving or dead. 




 Wall Street wants thier hands on all that money. 




 I'm impressed about your investments. 




 
i got one today! 




 reddit. 




 If they really stopped the vote changing by the republicans during the last election, I love them.  Wish it could be verified however. 




 Interesting.  I don't remember cuts to medicaid, food stamps, but I remember him cutting lots of people from SSI.  And it didn't seem like there was much said about it.  It was just done.  I would be interested in reading about that.  Also, it was overnight that people started appearing pushing grocery carts around.   I had never seen it before. 




 You could do it with foundation support. 




 I think it is remarkable, and a way of organizing workers which seems almost impossible these days.  I think it will probably be out of business once Obamacare is implemented however.  Will have to see. 




 Typing. 




 
I would like to spend one summer there. 




 AFSCME, the Public employee union. 









 A  lot less jobs due to robots. 




 Sunday night: Inaugural Party
http://inaugurationvegas.eventbrite.com/#

 




 I think it's good.  Maybe he can bring sense to these folks. 




 I've only dreamed about it... 




 I'm a 63 yr old female and never had children by choice.  I've also been married for 40 yrs.  I like quiet time, and I'm amazed at people that do have children and manage to accomplish so much in thier lives.  In many ways, I've done very little other than work.  I only regret not having children when I think about my husband and how he might have liked it and if it would have changed his life.  He accepted it however, and now says the world has enough children.  I also have a male high school friend who never had children and regrets it very much.  He would still like to have children. 




 I like it. 




 Yes, but that was after years of screaming about the debt.  Remember the debt clock in NYC?  It stopped moving. 




 I didn't read the article, but the headline is ridiculous.  Republicans screamed like crazy during the Clinton years also.  Just not during the Bushes or Reagan years when the debt was building.  Thom Hartmann believes it is a strategy called the "Two Santa Theory".  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Wanniski 




 This guy is sick. 




 Possibly Clark County Social Services. 









 I'm sorry I didn't go to summer school and graduate early, and I'm sorry I didn't apply myself more in college.  I thought it was just like high school l- floated through it.   




 There was an article on reddit recently where mothers in the Appalachia were women were keeping their children from learning to read so that they could claim they were disabled and eligible for social security disability.  If true, these stories break my heart. 




 Age of Aquarius? 




 He is quickly becoming one of my favorite congress member!  Republicans are not necessarily in favor of cutting the deficit.  They just don't like social programs that might help someone else.  They will always support private industry or military contractors. 




 
yikes. 




 I can't wait! 




 Let's only hope.  Remember, they still have the governorship and control of 30 state legislatures.  This has to end too. 




 Thanks for posting the link,  Sometimes we forget how good we have it! 




 Why are they wrong on EVERY issue? 




 I actually think in the end that the ACC is a support to business, like SNAP or Food Stamps helps farmers as much as people. 

























































































 I've written over 100 grant applications.  I used to call them term papers with a budget.  I don't know about Canada however.  Most agencies have their own guidelines and format that you can follow.  My experience is not recent, however, so I'm not sure where the RFPs (request for proposals) are posted these days.  Contact the agency that might cover the area you are interested in developing.  Ask them! 




 What's new? 




 Good comment.
 




 I believe these businesses were paying higher wages when Clinton was President because there was not enough supply of low-wage workers. 









 She works for me. 




 It would be 50 years or more before another bill would be done.  Dems have been trying to do this since Roosevelt. 




 They have to do SOMETHING.  They don't know how to govern, but they need to fill the schedule. 














 What is it with these folks?  They are crazy, unprincipaled. 














 Democrats don't hate Obama.   They actually like him but are disappointed that he hasn't taken on the system more. 














 That's how it was then too.  Only Woodward and Bernstein were reporting on it, and even then, news was thin prior to the 72 election.  It only started coming out AFTER he was reelected. 




 Seriously, I have wondered about that for years. 




 I threw up in someone's car once.   I wanted to apologize the next day, but couldn't remember who was there.  Never found out, and no one every mentioned it to me. 




 I was watching c-span and was shocked to hear him quote something he must have heard from Fox News - and it was wrong!  If you are not going to use the constitution, at least use facts! 




 I knew someone who used to do it, and got a new car every year.  She was very methodical and followed up regularly with her clients. 




 It means its time to tax the rich.
 




 I agree! 









 I didn't look at the article but worked as a employment counselor in a poor neighbors before. Only jobs at that time were mom and pop businesses, poor transportation, and the cost of bus fares and time it takes to getting anywhere.  I used to ask people their priority - close to home or higher hourly pay. Most preferred closer to home due to time. 




 I picked one up once decades ago.  He was carrying a large paper sack.  When he got out of the car, he reached in the bag and gave me a plastic baggie filled with grass.  I don't give strangers rides anymore, but it was a great memory. 




  I was taught in kinergarden to look both wars before I walk. People don't do that anymore. They feel like they own the road. It is scary nonetheless for everyone. 




 My grandfather worked for Great Northern Railroad for 50 years. And yikes, I was born in Seattle a year after this photo was taken... 




 This happened in Nevada too.  They didn't press charges against the company or the  employees. 














 We fought a war over state's rights too, and won. I keep hearing about state's rights. I'm cheating though. Didn't read the article. 














 So gross. 




 Let the public pay the salaries of employees? 




 I realized it, but it was too late to edit... I'm embarassed also.  Nothing worse than getting someone's name wrong. 









 Also, I remember the dirty look he gave Nancy Pelosi - Don't remember now if it was for illegal activities of GWB or the war, but it was searing, and I think caused her to change her answer. 




 If you don't have insurance, try health centers of Nevada. Located at Cambridge Comm Center. I haven't been there, but started a similar clinic years ago.   It is nonprofit, fed subsidized. They will accept insurance however. Very close to unlv. 









 Looks better than the door that I use as a top. 




 It is past time that we admit it:  The government subsidizes wages of large corporations through SNAP, medicaid and other forms of services.  We say it is for the poor, but it corporations paid a decent wage, then these services wouldn't be needed. 














 I would probably take the round the world cruise that takes a year or so and stops if every major port. 




 Don't you love how these legislatures care for their own people. Sounds like a voter registration opportunity to me. 









 Yes. I'm now 64 yrs old. Even though I have been married for over 40 yrs, I never had a friend with similar interests, including my spouse. Would like to plan, design and work on projects that could be fun and meaningful.  I have ideas at different times, but everyone is just busy doing their own thing and isn't interested.  









 I saw it a few years ago on tv.  Interesting. 




 I agree with that! 









 Now, if all these folks would register and ensure to vote..... 




 Actually, if they had recounted, Gore would have won Florida.  The Supreme Court stopped the vote.  Gore also had more votes nationwide, but lost due to delegate count (excluding Florida).  




 A can of tuna, a can of mushroom soup and cooked noodles topped with shreaded cheese and baked. 




 I'm just a soul whose intentions are good. oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood by Eric Burton I believe, or maybe Still haven't found what I'm looking for by Bono. 
























 My city had two bond issues one year on the ballot, one for schools and one for prisons.  I was shocked when the prison bond went through but schools failed. How short-sighted and sad.@ 




 That's why they call it conservative Sundays regarding tv. 




 Wow.  I heard they liked beer.  I put some out and only one showed up.  Never heard about watermelon. 




 Didn't they get retroactive immunity for this once already????? 




 I think it was a tv show hosted by Alfred Hitchcock.  A boy grew mushrooms in his basement.   They ended up taking over his body.  Very scary.  




 Conspicuous consumption. 




 Thank you. 




 The head of the IRS is a republican appointed by Bush.  You could built a good conspiracy theory here! 




 I just wish it was more consumer oriented. 









 Take me wlth you.
 




 Me too.
 




 Zion is about 3 hrs out of Las Vegas.  The Zions Narrows is an 18 mile hike down the river.  While I've walked a ways up the river, the full hike is on my short list.  It is beautiful there.  They only allow so many people in the canyon however, so you need to make arrangements first with the Park. 




 Where is this? 




 If those 1.5 million residents vote, the state will turn blue.  It's heading that way anyway. 




 Fun. 




 Sick huh? 




 Desert Bloom.  Although there are photos of old Vegas including LVHS, I heard it wasn't filmed here.  And no one mentions Viva Las Vegas! 









 I hate to tell you, but most people want to work.  It's hard for a lot of people to work when it's not enough to pay their rent. 




 Not really. It just told them what they want to believe, even if wrong. 









 After a few years, I decided to get serious, and I got to be pretty good.  I practiced with set shots including spot shots, draw and follow.  The other key for me was to be able to see through three shots, so I played a lot of three-ball just trying to make three shots in a row.  If you can continually make three shots, you can run out. 




 That looks pretty good!  Wish I had one right now. 




 I feel the same way.   




 For those of you who like this, there is a facebook site: Las Vegas, The Good ol' days.  A lot of old timers put photos, film and other comments on the page. 




 NPR did a piece on this, and some of the songs were hilarious.  A bunch of people played the Rightious Bros "You've Lost that Loving Feeling" at their wedding! 




 Me too. 




 Also, public housing stopped being built and HUD started contracting out Section 8 housing to investors owning multiple houses.  I remember seeing a story in my town where a man was renting a house to his girlfriend, and HUD was paying the rent. 




 Not far enough, 




 The initial story showed a homeless guy being sent to Sacramento, CA.  In the follow-up story, it showed him now living with his sister in Sacramento which is a better option than staying in a mental health hospital.  He literally was sent to family. 




 Not really. 




 I know, a California for-profit hospital. 




 wow. 




 Yes, and state employees have taken about a 20% pay and benefit cut in the last 4 years, and it doesn't look like the legislature will do anything to help it in the next two years.  State employees were already lowest on the totem pole with city and county workers. 




 I watched Anthony Bourdain there last night on CNN. I've been dreaming about it all day.  Then I see your photos.  Great pics! 




 Good for this boy.  When I saw the article title, I was hoping it was the young boy was was abducted by the Chinese as he was identified as being the next Dali Lama.   




 Partly it's like crying wolf.  We're tired of hearing of their continual outrage over something - anything.  I think Obama's right on this one:  there is no there there. 




 The NAACP was singled out; I just didn't hear about it until this week. 




 You're right.  It drives me crazy.  I've talked with some of these folks.  They are entitled, it's the other ones who are scamming the system.  It's insane. 




 The intent was different too.  Nixon saw it as a way to get rid of the bureaucracy. 




 You make good points and I do worry about Dems a lot too.  But,  the parties are not comparable in craziness.   




 I would just tax the Walton family since they earn 40% of all income in a year in the US.  Taxes used to be 90% in the US in the 50's ; 83% in England in 1980.  If it keeps going the way it is, no one will have any income at all to shop at Wal-Mart. 




 Thank you for your thoughtful contribution.  I saw a book on c-span today that was addressing these very issues...http://www.truth-out.org/article/item/1388:gar-alperovitz-the-prehistory-of-the-next-possible-progressive-era
This is a Truthout article on his book and thoughts about the subject.  He was talking today about coops, but he said long term we need to define the type of democracy we want. 




 No necessarily, but you you would have the freedom to find your purpose without having to worry about the necessities.   




 Exactly.  I don't think we have a choice. 




 There is an old town in Nevada also -  St. Thomas - that was covered during the filling of Lake Mead that is now being exposed. 




 Depressing huh? 




 That was what Cheney said. 




 When did you win your Nobel prize for economics? 




 It seems hopeless. 




 Good summation. 




 I can't believe she is still around and given credibility by the right.  I see her occassionally on C-Span.  Amazing. 




 You are not paying close enough attention.  I rarely hear Dems make the crazy type of statements that you hear 10 times a day from Republicans.  Check this article out that I just saw on reddit http://www.reddit.com/tb/1dz4tl
or listen to Rachel on MSNBC.  Is she biased?  You bet.  But she can back her stuff up with facts. 




 I just made a comment on another article about thier craziness is that we need to treat them as a cult and de-program them.  Then I see this article.... 




 We need to start treating them as a cult, and that they members need to be de-programed. 




 It's not too new.  It was proposed by Nixon. 




 I wish we could vote these guys out, but we can't seem to do it.
 




 I like Bugliosi, but Thom Hartmann has a good book which makes a strong case for the mafia. 









 Close.  Charleston and Main.  I don't remember anyone swimming it it though!  Great photo. 




 I've never heard of this university. 









 Thank you for your thoughtful response.  We read too little of this. 




 This link needs to be made in the science subreddit.  People there might be as interested as us. 




 I wasn't making reference to you. 




 I'm at the same place you are.  It's tough to live like this.  I don't know how people do it.  We can't give up though. 




 Wow. Thanks for the post. And since I missed the previous post, I'm glad you did this. 




 http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/04/gut-microbiome-bacteria-weight-loss?page=1 
























 I wish I could afford to travel to all of them.  Just beautiful. 




 This was the year my parents moved to Las Vegas.  May check out the Google Earth mentioned in the comments below.  So many memories. 









 Just not sure where I should post this.. 














 Great looking couple!  They look like they should have been cast on the Mod Squad. 




 Dream on.  I have a 401(k) that is 30 yrs old and is worth about the same as it was then. 




 Their deal will cost me about $400/mo.  I remember I was not working and had to pay taxes on my unemployment.  That also happened during that period. 




 And sat on the Wal-Mart Board of Directors for 12 yrs. 









 I hope Dems do not get passive, and actively pursue voter registration of these folks. 














 They actually paid more -- 110%. 




 Gret comments. 




 That was beautiful. 




 You will spend a lot of time driving between sites.  You may want Tito look at travel times. 




 You're missing all the wonderful parks in Utah!  Check them out. 




 Nice. 









 We would have two more crazy senators. 




 Wow.  Just having Bernie tour the country would be great. 




 Me too.  If you go back further, you have FDR which I think was our best president ever.  Would have liked to live during his tenure.  My grandparents loved him. 




 I loved to listen to Clinton talk (yes, he is the explainer in chief), but he was not our best president.  The trade bills hurt Americans, except for CEOs on international companies and repealed the Glass-Stegall Act.  That being said, unemployment was the lowest I've seen in my lifetime. 




 They turned off the debt clock in New York City because it was going backwards.  They didn't want to pay bonds off before they were due, so essentially we did have a surplus. 




 They may shift the burden to state governments, but usually with the money.  It's called block grants to the states, and states decide thier priorities. 




 Most local governments are paying for medical care now at County Hospitals that can't turn people away.   




 Medicare, Part E - E for everybody. 




 Thank you! 




  I can't find my saved items on Reddit anymore.   




 I just learned that.  I've been upset over the fact that I didn't go see it when I was at Black Rock. 




 For sure. 




 I think small businesses were better off before the large corporations took over.
 




 Based on your opinion.  I'm not sure how you could factually document why smaller government is better.   




 I'm not sure how good it is now, but it used to be that veteran's had the highest satisfaction with their health care. 




 I think Section 8 was to get federal money to private investors who could buy housing/apartments and get their mortgage paid by the government.  Section 8 made a lot of people money.  They was also a huge HUD scandal during the Reagan administration that cost us billions.  You don't hear anything about it today. 




 I used to think that the South would only vote for a republican OR another southerner, i.e. Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton.   They turned against both of them though.  Jimmy Carter, a real evangelical! 




 Time to revisit the "Two Santa Theory" of republican tactics:
http://www.democraticunderground.com/10021632181 









 Single payer would make sense.  Some parts of the economy should be for the public good, not private profit. 




 I also wonder how much they are paid to be trolls. 




 Seniors use to vote Democratic because they were grateful for medicare and social security.  I can't believe how they have changed.  It's got to be fear. 




 I have a legend I would like to know if it was true or not.  My parents told me that prior to central air conditioning, hotels bought cooks cases of beer to cool off during hot desert summers in Las Vegas. 




 She is a real artist.  Very creative and beautiful. 




 I think you are right. They should pay a price, and they were heading towards bringing down the world economy - because they didn't like a law. 




 And how much did it cost? 









 Yeah! 









 Many employers USED to think of their employees as family, and care about their wellbeing.  Now, it is only the bottom line.  I think alot has to do with local, small businesses vs corporations who don't know or care about the employee. 




 http://www.weather.com/news/science/nature/worlds-most-amazing-places-fly-geyser-20130617 




 He was active during Clinton's impeachment. 




 I think you are right. 




 How about a war started on false premise, or the econy collapse. Those two items should be enough. 




 I read a book recently that said World War I didn't end until the fall of the Berlin wall in the 1980's. I think this guy has it right. They are still fighting over state's rights which should have been settled in the Civil War. 









 Right now, Matt Taibbi. 




 I saw Ted Cruz's father on C-Span and all I can say is that I understand why Cruz is the way he is. His father is an absolute lunatic. 




 There is a great book published during the Bush years called "The Banana Republicans".
http://www.amazon.com/Banana-Republicans-Turning-America-One-Party/dp/1585423424 




 You are absolutely correct.  There may be only 30 who consider themselves moderate.  There is plenty of documentation to back this up. 




 I love their sense of humor.  That's great. 




 Unfortunately, you are correct. 




 My favorite politician EVER. 









 I kind of like that idea. 




 Religion is based on faith, not reason. 




 There are a lot of wonderful Christians who do help.  I know them!  But as a group, they are capable of bringing the whole system down - like in the debt ceiling confrontation happening in congress, or the lack of belief in science and the denial of global warming, which will create untold horrors.  And, in the end, do we really want children to go hungry? 




 There are probably programs at your county that will pay for a year of your schooling for a year of paid service.  You should talk with the counselor at your college. 


 




 The above post is a repost from politics to Vegas.  Let's hope this guy isn't right. 









 It wasn't a filibuster; it only looked like one on tv. 




 I wondered about that too. 




 There are sure a lot of right wing folks on reddit.  




 

















I guess you never read John Locke.



 




 They tried to in Wisconsin, and lost.

 I'm just sick thinking how seniors are now mostly republicans. Dens brought them social security and medicare. They used to know this and support dems. 




 FDR was amazing. Can't believe he hasn't been mentioned. 














 I'd like to see a test showing how you could change people's minds about a social issue in the short run.  
























 Exactly.  He was awfully quiet during the Bush years. 




 That's the best definition I ever read.  I would post it if it was in an article format!  Thank you. 




 Reading the comments, I can't believe how many redditors are republican.  Are they ALL on reddit? 




 We don't need to cut the size of government.  We need to go back to collecting taxes from those who can afford it.  A big country needs a big government to do big things. 




 So, we stop educating children???? 









 Many of the rich don't want to pay taxes to support it.  




 I could only wish. 




 I want to be a Millennial. 




 He needs to be fired. 




 I've been saying this forever:  We need to look at a new way to distribute money rather than basing it on work - guaranteed annual income?  I don't see another way for the long term. 









 Good article.  I watched Elizabeth Drew religiously on PBS during the Watergate hearings.  
 




 I want to sign and send it out to all my friends, but I can't get in to the petition!  Will try later today and see if it is the same. 




 You did great. 




 Plentiful jobs at low wages. 




 Thanks for the posting.  I was wondering where the other bridges were located. 




 WHAT: Rally for Nevada Jobs

WHEN: Clark County Commission Meeting, Tuesday, September 3rd, 9:00am

WHERE: Clark County Commission Building, 500 S. Grand Central Parkway, Commission Chambers

 Interesting concept.  I used to think they had not been in control of  congress for so long, they didn't know how to govern. When they did control Congress, they did a terrible job on it. I still believe that they don't know how to govern, but how we got there may be different than what I thought.  We do have a problem with the constitution and giving them more representation than they deserve.  I'm not sure we will ever get them out. 




 A few years ago (when I was 60), I started dieting - I did my own diet of low carb, low calorie.  It was tough.  It took forever for the weight to start to drop.  I started walking - a little more each day - and did leg presses at the gym to get my strength up.  It took a while, but easily got up to 3 miles/day x 6 days/week - 20 minute mile - about 1 hr/day.  I only lost 30 lbs, but my pant size went from a 20 to a 12.  I stopped and it all came back very quickly.  I'm having trouble getting motivated again, but I know it works.  My doctor was really pleased with my vitals. 




 I hate thiefs. 




 Interesting take.  You may be right. 




 I haven't been to Burning Man, but I've been to the location (Black Rock Desert) for other activities.  It is awesome.  It is so big that when you are on the desert, you can see the curvature of the earth on the horizon.  It would be easy to get lost too. 









 You are right.  Nevada ranks #1 in the inability for people to find full time jobs. 




 This is the second qilded age. 




 I think that is the rule in Las Vegas.  Some restaurants pay like 2.00/hr expecting their employees to make it up in tips.  I think it sucks.
 




 That's the point.  Lift low-income workers salaries and everyone's rise. 




 Music was great and we felt we could change the world.  We failed unfortunately, but it was a good feeling. 




 I remember those!
 




 I have a friend who started buying electronic cigs from China with about $300.  He has built up his business where he now has 4 stores. 




 Join thousands of fast food workers as part of a nation wide strike to demand better pay and better treatment. Low-wage workers are having a hard time making ends meet while corporations such as McDonalds, Wendys, Burger King and KFC are making billions in profits. Theyre paying poverty wages and keeping the entire economy down.

 There will be strikes in the northwest and downtown Las Vegas from 6 to 11 a.m. on Thursday, August 29th. We will be dividing into two shifts, as we understand most people cannot attend the full day. 

 WHAT: 1st shift
 WHERE: PLAN  Las Vegas, 708 S. 6th Street, Las Vegas, NV 89101
 WHEN: 5 AM

 WHAT: 2nd shift
 WHERE: PLAN  Las Vegas, 708 S. 6th Street, Las Vegas, NV 89101
 WHEN: 9 AM

 For more information on the strikes contact:

 I wonder who has the "in" for contracts to do it. 




 A lot of boomers believed in politics and public service.  Trying to stop the Vietnam war and starting of the Peace Corps. We thought we could change society.  Many changed in the 80's however.  It's too bad that we failed. 




 Thank you for your thoughtful comments.  I couldn't have said them better. 




 Years ago, we had an anti-welfare march in our town with people who think just like you. I was volunteering at our local legal aid office. One of the leaders of this anti-welfare march was there seeking assistance. He had had a heart attack (no insurance), lost his job, then his wife. He was trying to get some help. He regretted his previous stance. The lesson is that we are all one step away from poverty.  I now work at a welfare office.  When jobs were available, we had a lot less clients. People on the whole prefer to work. 




 You direct your anger at the wrong folks. 




 Campaign finance reform. 




 Yes, I wish that Dems would have tackled this issue first when they were in power (rather than health care).   




 It drives me crazy when I hear people say that Republicans freed the slaves.  The Republicans who freed the slaves would all be Democrats today. 














 Everyone should read your response. It was great. 




 Really good point.  I wish I could give you multiple upvotes! 




 I haven't read the article yet, but I wanted to start a co-op in my community.  It is against the law.  Our electric company provides a partial rebate to few homeowners every 2-4 years to have it installed  for outrageous costs.
