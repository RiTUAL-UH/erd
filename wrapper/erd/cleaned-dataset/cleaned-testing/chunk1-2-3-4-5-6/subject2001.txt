 Dude, Where's Batman's Car? 









 While I do think this is well done, it's just another poster of someone looking away at something. Too many of those 




 I'd say one of my favorites is Coffee of Lies. 




 I remember back in the pre-season where Rex Grossman and John Beck were competing for the starting job, and The Redskins went undefeated in the preseason. It looked like we were on pace for a great season, but ultimately had once again another terrible one. I know RGIII looked less than good but I'm just saying that this is preseason so don't get too sad yet. 




 Which role did you have the most fun playing? 




 I don't carrot all what you say. 














 You fuck......that's pretty funny though 




 What does that mean? 









 RIP 









 I asked this question on the same day, and yet you get the credit. Fucking balls 




 The movie, 'Little Fucker' it looks terrible but oh so good 









 Hey I wanna pla 









 I think Lebron is doing this because he realizes that Cleveland does not have the players to win a championship. Make the finals? Sure why not, East is pretty weak (getting better I may add). But against the west? I don't think so. 














 Come on guys don't have a cow. 









 Pet Sematary, after the Dad trips and......you know.  




 From the picture I thought this would say Tom Hardy used to be a stand up comedian. 









 Who else thought this was Jason Bateman to direct a new Star Wars movie at first? 




 Only God Forgives red band trailer. 




 Walk into the club lik......*sigh* you get the damn point. 
























 Brian Hoyer.......fuck 




 I want to see a sack on Palmer so bad 









 Good game Guys but i don't think our defense can hold much longer. I'm impressed though. To the Cardinals! 




 Speaking of Bored

You're the worst! 




 I'll take 2 TD's from Royal please with a side of 50+ yards 




 Same with Brown and Bell -___- 




 Antonio Brown please get me 1 TD PLEASE!!!!! 









 They're showing the Vikings-Falcons game I yard of the 49ers game? Why????? 
























 Losing feeling in my toes. 




 Winner winner chicken dinner 




 Zodiac, I personally think this is Fincher's masterpiece. 




 Why run at all? 




 Yeahhhh if you could chuck a deep pass to Crabtree for a TD that'd be greatttt.  




 Pick 6 with Fitz calling it now 




 Why 2 fucking lost touchdowns FUCKING TWO!!!!!!! 




 I got Alfred Morris for a TD first quarter  




 Remember when the Skins beat Dallas for the division and you just felt we we're finally relevant again and had a victory that meant something big? Then we ended up winning 3 games the following season. I want to see this team win again, I want that great feeling again this Sunday soooo bad. Let's hope it happens. 




 Make it happen browns 




 Thanks for having faith in us Bill. 









 oh I know its not, let me dream man. 




 Hopefully Rg3 and Alfred Morris. 




 Do you think you can actually win or make it to the Super Bowl? Do you think your team can win your division? Can you're team win more than you did last year? What fantasy can you actually see come true this season? 




 I really hope this isn't a blow out, but im getting that feeling. Which team will be on what end though, that's the question. 




 Probably no Super Bowl this year, but can we get at least over 5 wins? Can Rg3 come back to form? Can we sweep the Eagles, Cowboys, or Giants? Can we win the divsion??? What is your fantasy that you can see actually happening? 




 Something something every thread 
























 AARE YOU READY FOR DISSAPOINTMENT!!!!! 




 Well fuck 




 Classic skins, D keeps us in it until the end 




 Can we discuss how non threatening this 49er team is, they are fucked against the Seahawks. 




 Wow horrible play call on 3rd and 5 




 Spoiler alert RG3's going to get sacked 




 Dont you be talkin bout my bow tie! 




 Oh yeah, well this isn't meth. 




 A top 10 play gone just like that, fuck you Cox 




 I got a little worried when I saw a Patriots player next to the word committed. 




 Fuck. 




 Come on lads, we got a doo sumfen, and that sumfen is ou and ou and ou! 




 How bout that bomb to Desean, if we can get more of those it will be amazing! I can't wait to play the Bucs! 




 Hopefully he doesn't fall due to some Tropic Thunder and cause Collateral damage Far and Away from land in the Rain, Man that sure would suck to fall out of the Vanilla Sky. Hopefully A Few Good Men will save him so he's not eaten by Lions, For lambs that would be odd, or attacked by a Last Samurai in the Knight and Day......Top Gun. 














 Can this defense actually make a stop? 




 Based Graham keeping dem Ingram YD hopes alive 




 Please Ingram just one 1 more TD ease Ingram 




 Get Cadet the fuck outta here 




 Run the clock with Ingram now MUHAHAHAHA 




 That was Ingram's TD you bastard! 




 I want to hug every motherfucka in this sub! 




 FUCK MORAL VICTORIES WE GOT A REAL ONE AGAINST ABREAL FUCKING TEAM!!!!!!!!' 




 Kerrigan I love you......but FUCKKKKKK 




 Please don't have Colt run it please I have a felling they will though. 




 The prophecy is coming true......sorry though Cowboys. 




 Definition of Redskins football. Still love the team though 




 Please come back Rg3 we miss you so much  




 Honestly how are we going to do anything on offense, I see many 3 and outs in our future. 




 Fake 




 Please PFM just get DT one TD just one PLEASE!!! I swear if Sanders gets one more I will riot. 
























 Thank you for not making this a fun fact post 




 Not that i disagree Iron Man 2 wasn't good, but that was a sequel that didn't carry much weight in the Marvel universe, while Man of Steel kicked off the DC universe with much less than a bang. 




 Can't Hold Us by Macklemore was fucking everywhere at one point. 




 True.....but fuck the eagles anyway!!! 




 Fucking fletcher actually does something fuck! DEFENSE PLEASE! 




 Are the eagles a fucking marching band, they are just marching down that field 




 Woah really thought RG3 went down 




 We are just giving  away yards to Ertz, 

Secondary: Yo Ertz you need some yards?

Ertz: Uhhh sure you guys gonna cover me still?

Secondary: Helllllll nah, take em 




 Yeah I feel an turnover coming  




 An interception would be a nice dagger  




 A nice dose of reality, fucking defense 




 Did no one else hear Gannon say play cock! 




 Sooooo play cock amiright? 




 Nope! 




 Fucking epitome of facepalm 




 I'll take an interception with a side of pick 6 




 While I do agree they need a better oline, they haven't been doing that bad today. Secondary though......yeah 




 Even if we win this game on some miracle pick 6 Haslett needs to go 




 Wow everyone but Breeland needs to be gone on this secondary 




 Right in the hands gotta bring that down  




 I Origins was a pleasant surprise this year. 




 Me too, great film 




 Also Dicaps in Catch Me if You Can 




 I asked him this question in his AMA, I'll probably frame this an put it next t all of my accomplishments 




 We sell quilts at discount price
Livin in an Amish paradise! 




 Hey Nick! I remember hearing you on the Nerdist podcast and you told Chris what you an your family do at home and like him I couldn't stop laughing for 20 minutes. Anyway just wanted to say you're hilarious, how are those guys down at Nerdist? 




 Which do you prefer, Chubby Pratt or Six Pack Pratt? 









 Wow all these comments and I haven't seen it once

sigh, I guess I'll do it 

'Chicken Parm you taste so good' 




 *listen closely  




 I feel it will go 

Lose to Colts: It wasn't his fault defense lost us that game, similar to RG3's game against the Texans

Lose to Giants: Ehhh could be better, he's not good, but not horrible, keeps under throwing Desean. 

Lose to Eagles: PUT RG3 IN THE FUCKING GAME!

Lose to Cowboys: Well Fuck 




 Please Mr. Apocalypse 
Oh oh
I don't wanna die in deep space 
























 Maybe I have. But yeah it's a pointless question considering the movie isn't out yet 




 I have a feeling the performance will be great, but the movie will get 50/50 reviews. Plus the director isn't known for making Oscar bait films, and if Nightcrawler didn't nab him at least a nomination, i don't  see how this will. 




 Hirsch wasn't nominated for Into the Wild 




 Promiseland was very meh 




 Spot on
 




 We've made quite a few moves improving our defense this off season, which is great, but the only problem is last year, while defense was a major concern, our offense was pretty abysmal. Obviously the team isn't going to be perfected in one off season, plus McCloughan still needs time to gather talent, but barring a breakout from RG3 (please!) were not going very far (which is expected already). 









 So what do you say to somebody you hate? 




 It's a perfectly made film, but an okay movie. 




 I don't know if this counts, but when Bruce Dern finally gets to drive the truck in Nebraska I got pretty emotional. 




 Mom's Spaghetti 




 THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU FUCKING SAY SO! 




 ....huh well alright 




 I saw both and still wanted Keaton to win, I thought they were both great, but mostly wanted Keaton to win cause he was the only one not based on a real person 




 You got it 




 What the fuck does the Sound of music have to do with anything Oscar related last year. 




 Ummmm 




 Other way around bro 




 A movie that comes to mind is R.I.P.D, Bridges and Reynolds were pretty awful together even though I like both actors. 




 THE PRESIDENT SHALL NOT BE THE SHINIEST OF TWO TURDS 




 And, scene 




 Dolla* 




 I'm so happy for guys and for Brady. Hope your sub welcomes non-patriot fans to celebrate! 




 Russell's next completion is going to be to a Seahawk?
 




 Russell's next completion is going to be to a Patriot 




 I'm interested what the QB situation is going to be. I don't just want RGIII to get the job without showing that he is indeed our best chance at winning. I think he's our best option right now, but if Cousins shows he's the superior option, let him play, if not Rg3 can prove himself. 




 Not his best, but still one of my favorites is The Aviator. Great performance by Leo and defiantly was of his more underrated gems. 









 *peanut butter and jealous 




 Lol......I don't get it

Edit: Fuck maybe I should read the title next time I'm in a thread 




 Andy Serkis was wayyy better in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and Lord of the Rings than Dawn, this certainly wasn't the movie to win him the Oscar. 




 Huh I feel there is one more classic movie not on that list..... Speaking of which I could go for some orange juice right about now 
























 I feel like the Worthington era ended awhile ago 




 Peter Jackson

 How about 
" We have a saying in America, the enemy of my enemy is my friend"
"We have a saying to, I don't care" 




 Lol I honestly do not see what's so bad about clapping, so what if people loved a movie so much they felt the need to clap, who are they hurting?
 




 Fool me once, shame on me, fool me twice....fiddle dee dee. 




 Reminds me of when he was on the Lakers and would always get those clutch steals, damn I loved him. 




 Only thing I can say is someone brought up he always has a "It's like if this random thing did this random thing, *Impression of said thing* 




 (null) 




 Who do you think is funnier, you or your wife? 




 Sorry many, but I meant to say what is the picture a parody of 









 What is this a parody of? 




 Well there you go 









 True, he'll more than likely appeal and get at least one game reduced 




 The Fucking Cowboys, that is some bullshit. 














 Saving Mr. Banks 




 ITT: Zack Snyder  




 Nothing, you already told her twice! 




 At least someone will lose.... 




 This is a fantastic cosplay of Suicide Squad! Can't wait to see what they look like in the movie. 




 Serpico!!! 




 Before the Devil knows you're Dead? 




 12 Angry Men or Dog Day Afternoon 




 /r/showerorange would like a word 




 Anne Hathaway's scene in Les Miserables, even though in technically did win her the Oscar. 




 We beat the bastards of City Hall! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 









 I swore that I was only going to watch the first trailer because it sold the movie so well, plus I want to have the ultimate experience, however now the new trailer is fucking everywhere now so I need to know, is anyone else not watched it yet and with me?
