 Yea these rock. I use em for methadone sometimes. It makes a really nice fine and airy powder that absorbs nicely up in your nose.
 




 On this topic of having money and its dry... That really is ALWAYS the way, I dont know why, maybe supply and demand. I mean if you get a paycheck everyone else is getting a paycheck also and you would think dealers would be re-uping but I guess its the opposite. Anyways hope you score soon man, good luck.  




 Well there's the obvious which is if you eat them and throw up your removing the drug from your stomach. But if you snort them or boot them I dont know why your high would go away unless you weren't high to begin with. Not sure if that is any help. 




 Yes I have come across these a few time's. I think there great. Sometimes I actually prefer doing 3, pink 10mg oxys because it kinda tricks your brain into thinking your doing more than just 30mgs cause you have more powder. But yes these pink 10mg k-56's will have the same effect as a blue 30 if you do three. The extra filler doesn't add up to much. Enjoy!
 














 Haha Probably both 




 Title Should have been Taming instead of training... my bad 
























 They do have a version for the Wii but I haven't played it. Anyone try that one? I wounder if it is as awesome 




 This store in my town called 3D games buys and sells every kind of game and console. Its like a pawn shop. I just pawn my old games for credit for my new ones. They pay good money too. 




 I remember I went to movie gallery or blockbuster and printed off my best pics when I was a kid and that game was still new 




 And the pokeflute that made them dance! 














 Your not alone kind sir 




 I do this almost ever time I'm on the pooper. 




 Oh ok that makes a lot more since. Yea i am offering the complete collection  of the first 3 sets or what people will offer. Its still not that valuable
 I havnt got an offer over 20$ 




 Yes. 




 Exactly. Your mind takes over 




 no, I didn't mean to lead you on. I didn't realize these sets have hardly any value. Its been about ten years and all the cards are in mint condition. I assumed I could get at least 100 or more but someone said they saw a set on amazon for 7-9 dollars. Guess I'm going to have to wait until they become more valuable.  




 Yeah I have seen these sets too. I am offering all three sets though but I guess I'm going to have to wait awhile till they become more valuable. I've never seen a set that low but I have seen a fossil set for 20  




 I would but that's about the shipping cost

 You obviously have no idea how rare a complete collection of all three base sets are. there are individual cards worth more than 40 dollars 









 I am looking to sell my collection of Pokemon cards. I have every card from the base, jungle, and Fossil sets (all Pokemon and all trainers). I have a binder that has keep all my cards in mint condition for the last 10 years. There is a mix of fist edition, promos but I have every Pokemon from each set. If there is anyone interested my e-mail is test_subject201@yahoo.com Please feel free to asks questions or anything. Ebay suggests to sell each card individually to make decent money but i don't have the time or patents. I'm willing to sell for a cheep, reasonable price. I am hard up for money right now so any offer would be pondered. I can send pics, lists, or anything for any serious inquiries.

 Awesome answer. 




 Who the fuck would down vote this!? 




 Thats a comic on its own. Maybe that will be my next one. 




 would be a lot easier to read and maybe a bit funnier if the spelling was better. But still a crazy story worth telling 




 my mind has its own mind! 




 That would make an awesome meme. I would use it. 









 The bear is the best. I FUCKING TOLD YOU! 




 Yeah man. This incident was when I went to see NOFX in road island one year. I was so fucking star struck. I bet I looked just like that 














 Yea there defiantly are. And their face looks just like that 


































 [RUCKUS](https://www.facebook.com/artist.ruckus?ref=hl) is my alias.
 









 The artist [RUCKUS](https://www.facebook.com/artist.ruckus) made a facebook page and has been adding some of his work to it. Check it out! 




 I know, I love this picture. Shes almost 3 years old now and still melts my heart. *tear  




 Very rare indeed.  









 I don't know man. I guess these people think their art critics or they dont approve of stencil work.  









 She's almost [3 years old now](http://imgur.com/rapbStW). we have 2 JRTs and there like our kids. I love when they dream of running or swimming and there little paws start moving. 




 I have some blue and pink peony right now but haven't got that far into the project to decide. 




 But... blowing stuff up is... fun... 




 Anyone have any good ideas for some good names? 




 why yes they are! But I am more interested in seeing a (self propelled)  mortar launch out of a rocket in mid flight and also address the challenge of making it successful. What I think may happen is once the mortars launch out of the rocket, the rocket and the mortar will push against each other and just push apart, making the mortar go up a bit more and the empty rocket shaft go down. Kinda like repelling magnets in zero gravity. Also this is just a first draft of simply an idea. I thought it would be cool. 




 I still have a lot of kinks to work out. This is pretty much a first draft of a cool idea I had, so not much effort went into the physics of it yet. Thank you for your concern for my safety. I already play it very safe and you are very right about a fail to lift scenario. That would really suck but I would treat it like you said, as a loaded gun. Maybe I will even go as far as launching it from inside my jeep and film it instead of standing next to it just in case.  




 Its nice to hear some support! Everyone is like... bad idea, illegal, wont work. Like I said, this is just an idea I thought to draw out so I wouldn't forget. I wasn't really planing on making it but now I want to make this or something similar . So far I have some great ideas for how to make it work and work safely. Also yes, it wouldn't really matter if the mortars ejected properly (especially at night) because the main goal is to just get the mortars up in the air with fuse lit, so wasn't really planning on being able to recover a (still in one piece) rocket. Even though that would be nice. I will make a video when I get the time to make this happen! 




 This would make an awesome pic for r/photoshopbattles 




 I am a man with a kids mentality. Get it right 




 Thanks for your words of wisdom. This was just an idea I drew up one boring night. I've posted a lot of these ideas but for some reason this got a lot more attention maybe because of some controversy. But I pride myself on being safe and I probably wont end up making this. If I do something like it in the future I will think of your words. 




 yea good call, thanks. I just did this as a cool idea and I love the feedback. Ill prob start off small with a 1inch mortar and a nice strong engine and long nose. If anything im inspired to make it work now. And of course take all the safty precautions.  




 haha im imaging that happening and my inner pyro is happy. And awesome idea on the double one casing mortars btw. thank you kind sir 




 Thanks ill check that out
 




 [Yes](http://imgur.com/gIuMpJ5) 




 This is just a glimpse into my twisted mind. Probably not something I would carry through with for a few reasons. Not sure if its legal and its defiantly dangerous. And yes I would need to do some real world calculations when it comes to weight and other factors. This is just a concept I though would be cool. 




 If its made out of a shopping bag its parashoot. haha Thanks bud 




 Yea it probably wouldn't work with a c6-5, if at all. The idea of a longer rocket is something I overlooked. I got to caught up in the concept of how to get the fireworks in the air. 




 Yea I understand. This is just an idea I had that I probably wont go through with. I really have no idea if this would work but this is a glimpse into my mind.
 









 Much appreciated! 



















 As you attorney I recommend to wear this on halloween. 
 



















 I don't understand. why can't you use those terms? I see them everywhere.  




 Hey thanks for the heads up. I rely to much on spell check and the rage maker doesn't underline misspelled words. my bad... my bad 




 What the fuck is this? I know its a dick but how is it relevant? 




 it was the *not bad* face that got me. 




 haha thank you. 100% true. Holding in that laugh felt like an eternity.   









 No, I didn't! but thank you for that link! His lyrics are so deep and meaningful backed with some of the most relaxing and soothing music. I can spend hours reading lyrics. LCW is a great album and I kinda got that feeling it was about that. Thanks again for the link man!  




 Modest Mouse for me is awesome when im in deep.  




 We've already talked talked to our vet and they said it would  be fine to breed her with a small stud. she is an english jack and normal is between 9 to 14 pounds so she is in the norm. We also have a 13 pound female but prefer the temperament and looks of the 10 pound. We plan to keep most of the puppies ourselves and only give a couple to close friends that we know would have time and the love they need. If they need round the clock nursing there is not a problem, I am home all the time and if I go out my wife is home. we don't leave our dogs unattended. and yes the vet would do shots, tail docking and dew claws and any other care they may need from a professional. We did a lot of research be fore we bought our dogs the ten pound is 3 years  old and the 13 is 2.  The breeder we got them from is no longer breeding and we would like to have more like her. we have looked for other breeders for english jacks but they are not very common where we are. we have thought a lot about this and would not do anything to harm either of our babies. I hope this answer all of your questions. 




 I have a 10lb female English Jack Russell Terrier. She is a pretty small Jack and me and my wife are looking to breed her. We live in Maine and are looking for a Stud but we want to find a small male because we are worried about her small size and that the pregnancy will hurt her. Does anybody have any advice on breeding small dogs and or know of any place to find a small English Jack Russell stud? 





























 thank you! you can see more of my stuff [HERE](https://www.facebook.com/artist.ruckus?ref=hl) 




 Don't tell me thats a little Jack Russell. I have [TWO](http://i.imgur.com/d5H00OI.jpg) this brings tears to my eyes. You should do a painting or something and invest some time and make it awesome. 









 He looks very annoyed that he can't even make nachos without getting his picture taken. 









 yea but thats not all stencil work. Most of it I hand painted. Tedious work. I'm glad my friend took the picture because the wall was taken down a week later. But the photo lives on! 




 (Repost, from *persons name*)should be put in the title so the person dosent "accidentally" take credit for the image. 




 [NOW](http://i.imgur.com/74ck31h.jpg) its a desert with black bananas falling from the ocean sky 




 Yes I agree, I thought you were already an artist that has done stencil work before. But for leaning purposes your right on when doing it is simply the best way to learn, so it doesn't matter the content. You can feel how the paint and stencil react to each other, thinness in your card-stock, many things that you don't even consider. In the end just do what works best for you. Just because someone might praise one way of doing things might not mean it works for what your doing. That applies with anything really. I didn't mean to come off harsh I just really hate when people take someone elses work, cut it out, then call it their own. Keep it up. If you have any questions feel free to ask. I like to help. Check out some of my work [HERE](https://www.facebook.com/artist.ruckus?ref=hl) 




 Why don't you be creative and make your own art? This is a Banksy piece and its very well known. When people see it (if they know of Banksy) they are going to just think to themselves that someone has no creativity. Please do us a favor and not recreate other peoples art. Can you honestly not think of anything original?  









 I don't know why you had to waste your skills with a painting of fucking Miley Cyrus. She shouldn't have anything to do with art let alone BE art. And if you consider her an artist, you need to be euthanized immediately. 




 The wind ended up lifting the stencil up outside when I was painting it and lost its definition, and the more I tried to fix it the worse it was coming out. So then I was just like fuck it ill blindfold her. You can see her eyes so it doesn't make since but it kinda looks cool. [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/5LDXapC.jpg) is what I was going for. Check out more of my work [HERE](https://www.facebook.com/artist.ruckus?ref=hl) and like the page if you could. 









 First we bought one plan at our local skate store but it was too expensive and too big. After looking everywhere online I stumbled onto this plan. It was so detailed and perfect for what we were looking to build. I couldn't tell you where to find it but it was perfect because it was just big enough and if I recall just under 500 dollars. But we had a bunch of left over plywood we stashed under the half pipe. So the best advise I can give is try to find something in your budget, have some friends help you, and get all the material before you start. And make sure that shits level. The surface is 2 layers. First plywood, then skate-light or something similar. Let me know if you have anymore questions.   




 I found a really great plan online. So we started saving some money but my grandma ended up paying for it as a x-mas gift. She also let us build it on her lawn. Shes a cool lady.
 









 Awesome pun sir 









 Check out my Facebook and see some more art by Maine Street artist Ruckus [HERE](https://www.facebook.com/artist.ruckus) need some likes 




 Not as bad as you would think. Really fun for some high school kids in the dead of winter. 









 Holy monkey balls. 




 Man, your set. Even got the snickers handy. Smart man. 




 Thank you for that information. 




 Oh yea and about the strings, I was using my acoustic all day. Even tho I use Erni Ball acoustic Reg. I dont care who you are, after playing all day with heavy strings your gonna loose some skin. If I was playing my PRS, no problem, can play that shit all day. I took a shower after and the tips of my finger peeled off, but that happens to all of us. 




 Honestly man, if you can actually count how many songs you know then your not as experienced as you think you are. Ive been playing for 10+ years and I couldn't give a fuck how many songs I know. If your truly a fucking musician than you of all people should know thats its about having fun and making music. I don't know why your acting like douche but your ego is far bigger than your guitar skills my friend. Boom.  




 Man, I sincerely feel bad that this new generation won't grow up with old Disney movies and game boys. And those Disney movies were works of art, everything down to watercolor and sound effects. You know? 









 Dick^ 




 [Here](http://imgur.com/a/5xOuD) is some pics of us building the thing. 




 It deserves lots of love indeed. Man, the hours I spent on the school bus playing that. Remember how awesome and new it was to have a lighted screen? 




 Oh the irony... Kid makes a statement by smashing a PS4 yet just handed sony 600 dollars. good effort?   
 









 Where's the fun in that? Fuck long finger nails. If you can get those fuckers to bleed treat it like a trophy. Also acoustic guitars do way more damage. No offence. it doesn't matter how you play it its all about what you can produce. Take Hendrix for example, right handed guitar played left. 




 I have no idea why I found that so funny. but... just great. ahhhh 




 A wise man once said guitar is easy to learn but take's a lifetime to perfect.  









 So many questions... So fucking many.
 




 Thank you sir! This deserves more attention in this sub. 




 Haven't been able to find the video. It must exist because the pics are screenshots from a video. Maybe someone will find it
 




 Holy actual shit... 









 Let me let you in on a secret. Most religions (especially Christianity) are a scam... A fairy tail of heaven to make old people less scared and hell to scare young people into believing. This universe is infinite... having no beginning and no end. This means you are also infinite... Our bodies are like hermit crab shells that we shed after death. Have you ever wondered what the afterlife is like? It is a lot like being born. You don't remember because live is never ending and always finds a way. I figured this out over time and through wise people, and I wish I would have known this as a kid like you because once you realize this (and many other things you will come to learn) you will know true happiness. Life is love and we are all here experiencing ourselves. I have been in your shoes but let me tell you how lucky you really are. You are alive and you have a future believe it or not... and you live in a time and place that is a gem in our universe so take advantage of it and don't listen to these fucking church goers. Find something or someone you love and loose yourself in it and always remember you have an eternity to find piece and happiness and believe me son, you will. I hope this helps. 




 The [Stencil](http://i.imgur.com/Djvwy4e.jpg) to this piece. 
























 let me know how you do, dont burn the house down. 




 This was from about 10 yards. I started out from farther back but ended up moving in closer cause I wasn't doing well. Its really fun. I noticed the flame goes out if the pellet is at lease about an inch away from the flame.  




 Agreed, Title sucks too. 









 I really dig your style. My last name is also Turner and I also have a similar style. Turners rule. 




 You should post this to R/wallpapers.
 




 This is pretty cool. Nice find 









 I think it helps to turn the brightness down on your TV. If that doesn't work try sitting father away from the TV. Or maybe try some motion sickness pills? 




 No problem 




 I ended up making that tutorial. I broke the one in this picture and figured it would be good opportunity to show the process. [ENJOY](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiklhUbSCVg feature=youtu.be) 




 The vics where just some extra pills I got. I usually do methadone and Xanax, that's my thing. And oxys and anything else good when I can get my hands on it. I try to stay away from APAP but these vics where free. 




 Believe it or not, those red speckles are the hydrocodone. The rest of the white is all APAP. I've been board before and tried to separate them. Long story short. Not worth it.  




 Thanks, only certain people recognize that when they look at my table. Theres all kinds of stuff like that all over it. 




 I don't but I could make some and post it. Now that I think of it I really should share my plans because its amazing how effective it is. The difference is like popping a balloon with a pin and untying the knot and letting the air out slow. PM me if you need the plans asap. But I will make some and post it on this sub. 




 Defiantly let it pass through. I did a lot of research/ trial and error before coming up with this. What happens when the bullet travels through the tube air is escaping out the holes and you want as much of that air to go away as possible so do away with the inner tube. Tried it and it works way better. 









 Yes the silencer is functional and work VERY well at suppressing the sound. It is modeled from how a real suppressor is made and works but with much less expensive material. The barrel is made from 3 aluminum cans (short v8 cans) and the 3 air breaks are made from 3 aluminum energy drinks that have a screw on cap. I also hot glued cotton around the chambers to further reduce the noise which works great. Its amazing the difference. It fits nice and snug with no screwing thanks to a sharpie pen that fits into the 1/4 inch hole after the muzzle. Anymore questions let me know. 




 Thats for taking the time to take the picture! Thats a sweet set.  



















 I got the shaker and glass from a friend that gave it to me when he moved but thats all I got, no shot glasses. What do those look like? I use it all the time/ Best free thing I've ever gotten. 









 I think its fun as hell. It has 3 fail/safes and isn't stupid. Maybe a little dangerous but that's what makes it fun. You rocket guys on here are all so stuck up. Apparently I'm the only one that thinks this is cool.

 One of the fastest ways to cool off hot food off I've encountered yet. Its right up there with holding it out of a car window driving down the interstate. Without the risk of getting bugs in it.

 [Cat Attack!](http://i.imgur.com/Zi8QxC2.jpg) 














 This is really amazing. I've never seen this before. Thank you for sharing the link. 




 Thanks you! People can be really harsh with their critics on this subreddit sometimes though. I hate when I just finish a piece that I put so much time and effort into and then just get down votes with no comments or reasons for them. I guess what i'm saying is keep your chin up if people want to be dicks. I know I have too. I think your really talented with your digital brush. Keep it up! 




 It's great that you took in consideration to blur the snowflakes. It gives the piece movement and makes you feel the womens chill from the wind. Nice job. I use Photoshop and paint and do stencil work but from what I know this takes mad patience. 




 This is exactly what I got today. 4 subs and everything! Care to share what they cost in your neck of the woods? there pretty expensive in my area. 




 [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/NauyCcj.jpg) is what I started from. I'm not sure what your referring to. 




 I prefer the cap for my type of work. I like the angled spray for stencles and obviously regular caps for actual graffiti. I'm a street ARTIST not a penis maker. I use what works I find it funny that krylon supports anti graffiti campaigns because I steal there paint and do it anyways. And as far as drips go, if your experienced enough you can control it. Go fuck yourself. 





























 I think we got them at wal-mart. The brand is Chuck-It. They last forever and are a smaller size so they fit in our small dogs mouths better. You can also get bigger ones. There awesome. They never seem to loose these ones out off all there other toys they have. 




 same here. My two Jacks each have one and they are the only ones still standing. This one is the same way, she will put the ball on any part of my body so she knows I can feel it. She likes to put it up against my lower back when I'm sitting because she knows it drives me crazy and I will keep throwing it. It amazes me how smart this breed is! 




 I'm so happy that she had a positive effect on your evening. They say having a pet (or in this case an adorable picture) can lower stress levels, blood pressure and related illnesses. I hope tomorrow goes smother for you! Deep breaths.. 



















 I actually posted a few picks of splatter from this in the Art Sub. and everyone was so fucking mean to me. Calling me an idiot, gay, my 2 year old can paint better than this. just mean shit. Thanks for the kind words. 




 your pretty close. I try to keep my good gear away from stuff like this so it dosnt get ruined. 




 Never took a video of that. I really should have but the snow is mostly gone where I live and Its back to being a regular bandit again anyways.

 Hes putting in a VW 




 From Plans. I believe its a sonex 2 seater. 




 Yes I believe so. Its come a long way since these pics were taken. I just haven't seen him for awhile. 














 Thats a fuckin samsquamch 




 Maybe that has to do with what kind of opiates you use. I know different types have different itch levels (with me at least). May I ask what you use primarily?  




 That actually sounds like it would do the trick. You have a dog im guessing? or did your teeth itch too one night? 




 I broke my head cherry at a bed bath and beyond... There. I said it. 




 Mines called a bear claw. It puts rolling on the floor and itching your back on a corner to shame. 




 well, I was entertained. 




 Yea for sure. The jeweler that cut it off said to wait a few weeks until her finger is normal again. Then she can have it fixed and sized.  




 That's a great story. Sad she didn't get to wear a ring for so long. That's what my wife's ring is made out of, white gold. Damn that thing was expensive but I love her and I think its her all time favorite thing. She is sad she has to wait a few weeks for the swelling to go down before she can get it fixed and sized. She defiantly couldn't wait 40 years haha.  




 It is REALLY dull but its so dull that it is perfectly flat because its basically been sanded down overtime moving over mirrors. Even with new razors it leaves little streaks where the new razor isn't perfectly flat. 









 I shall name it... The bat razor. Making lines and fighting crimes. 









 Heres an update! We ended up going to the jewely store today. Got the ring cut off professionally and it can now be repaired and sized. [HERES](http://i.imgur.com/72R5CHd.jpg) a pic of the ring. And one of her [FINGER](http://i.imgur.com/VeWTRWW.jpg)

 Who does this 30 minute shipping? Amazon? Are you telling me you can buy stuff online and have it shipped to your house in under and hour? teach me! Tell me! I bet its expensive tho 




 Yea that's what were going to do. Unless the swelling doesn't go down in the next hour I will be taking her to the ER. 




 If they cut the ring off at the ER do you think the ring can still be sized and come out of it looking fine? or does it really screw it up. She has 3 expensive rings soldered together and She wont do anything that will screw up the ring permanently unlessl she was gonna loose a finger or something. Its not bad like that tho.
 




 Well the swelling went down yesterday after we tried just pulling it off with dish soap. The swelling went down that night then tonight we tried the Floss trick and that almost worked but it made her finger swell up even worse. But we will take your advice tho. If it goes numb, looses feeling, or stays swelled we will go to the ER. Thanks for the help! 




 This is actually what caused her finger to swell like it is. We thought the trick looked like it would work awesome but didn't work that great. Now her finger is swelled like in the picture. Were gonna wait to do anything until the swelling goes down 




 We will go to the jewerly store tomorrow and see if they can do it first before I buy a cutter on amazon. Its not like this happens enough to need to own one. Thanks for the info tho! 




 This is what we will most likely end up doing. She needs it re-sized anyway. Her finger has feeling and is fine but thats the kind of advice I wanted. Thanks 




 she is not loosing feeling, we tried yesturday and it got swollen then too.  




 Yea no luck. Its swollen because we tried the trick with dental floss and it didnt work. 


































 I'm really surprised this isn't a thing or at least an option. Lets sell our own brand of needles with this on them. We just need a sweet name. 









 Well you can fuck right off then. Everyones thinking it 




 Did you also do the video editing? I do street art and video. Just curious if you also did the video too. Nice soundtrack btw. 




 That was good, thanks 




 I'm sorry but this... (From #12) "In this world there is room for everyone and the earth is rich and can provide for everyone." is the most false and ignorant statement ever.

 Yes, in the rare and right context but women can also use these in very evil ways. Are you a women? If you are you just wouldnt get it...
 









 Yes true, but it says they only had a glimpse of it. Just enough time to see something and jump to conclusions. Then question everything you know. 




 Is it not possible a person went skydiving, gilding, or something similar without reporting it first? The other 2 thoughts I had was it could be a R/C Plane or kite (yes Very high, but still. Look at the link). Or a metor in the shape of a person.

 Believe it or not that was a mechanical pencil. Look real close. 




 This was an assignment when I was in college film school. The person is not me in the video, hes a friend of mine. This was shot about 5 years ago. The assignment was to combine video and music together so they complement each other.  




 Damn that took a lot of work to get that shot. The lighting had to be just right. Pain in the ass for less than a second of screen time. 




 The use of slow motion and speeding up shots really helped in giving it that real feel. 




 Yea that's my favorite shot. I was constantly spraying my friends face with a spray bottle of water to keep the cold sweat look going. 




 Yea It fits really well

 Yea for sure. I have been using streamers lately but they do hit hard but like you said its worth it when you don't want to loose it. Ive been using OpenRocket and it really gives you a lot of info I can use for better launches. Thanks a lot for recommending that! 




 Thanks for your advice. Your definitely right about there being to many variables to be able to predict landing area. I was hoping there was some equation where you input thrust, height, and wind speed and come up with a 10X10 foot estimate. But like you said, it wouldn't be something you could do on the fly. 




 I'm looking for some basic math on how to figure out where my rocket will land (with or without parashoot) Right now I'm using basic C6-5 Estes motors so I can look up all the statistics online for the thrust. Any advice would be appreciated.   




 Nobody cares about your birthday.  




 What a waste of time watching this. THIS IS NOT FUNNY! AT ALL! 




 Why is this funny?
 




 Agreed. Those titties took me by surprise. 




 Its not. downvotes all around. 









 You can actually visualize sound traveling in this gif. As people are hearing GO! it takes a moment for sound to travel to someones ears. So the people in the front go first and everyone else follows. 





























 Agreed. poetic and insightful. It must have took awhile to write it.

 I can see this dude being about 400 pounds with no neck and a learning disability.  




 Or maybe its a trap to keep selfi taking, duck faced people off the streets. 




 That a good point. I feel like we would break them if we told them that. Their face would get a permanent confused look forever.
