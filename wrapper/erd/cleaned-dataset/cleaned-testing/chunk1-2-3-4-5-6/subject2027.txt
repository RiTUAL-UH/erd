 Welcome everyone to GTSIM. It has been just over two weeks since I started this sub and it has grown rapidly. We have 996 subscribers as this is posted and I expect it to pass 1K by the time most of you read this. 

First of all, I want to thank all of you for upvoting and subscribing. There isnt much interaction in terms of comments and submissions, but that will change soon as we grow. Most of the posts are mine, and I am fine providing content while this sub grows. If you guys think I am submitting too much or not enough,  let me know. 

Secondly,  I want to thank /u/dontgive1011 for his css contributions. If you guys have any feedback on the look of the sub, send a modmail or post on this thread. 

Lastly, please start contributing more content. Even if its just a picture you see on another sub or website and think "thats a gtsim shot," feel free to xpost it here. And if you find a discussion out in the front page subs where this sub is relevant, name drop it, even as a joke. It seriously helps. For example, many new users hear about /r/gonewild from someone making a joke about it on a default sub. Try dropping those hints but with /r/gtsim if it seems relevant.

Together we can grow this sub.

I'm still a new mod and I am learning so if you have any concerns,  advice, suggestions, hate, or love, let me know. Even if it is just to let me know about a typo on the sidebar or something. 

Thanks, test_subject2027. 






















































 This happened two years ago. We were having a bbq before a game and he prepared some veggie burgers and I made some meat burgers. He mushed his veggie burgers up real good and it actually looked like meat after we cooked them. We put the leftovers in the fridge and went to the game. 

When we got back I was a little bit drunk and was hungry so I opened the fridge and grabbed what I thought was the left over meat burgers. 

It was a mis steak.

 What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? Ill have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and Ive been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills.

I am trained in gorilla warfare and Im the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words.

You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. Youre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and thats just with my bare hands.

Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.

 We are all friend now.  




 Im just a girl, like any other, on reddit trying to find dank maymays.  




 The long con. I like you 












































 I changed the sub default.  



















 I made the sub nsfw for default. Although there isn't nearly as much porn as I was expecting. I'm considering making it normal and just tagging individual things.  














 Done 





























 Ok I made it, /r/gasmaskgirls 



























































 There was this forest beside my school and I would go there and build forts. 

One of my friends, lets call him caleb, because thats his name, would go with me sometimes. We usually worked during lunch or after school since we both rode our bikes home and our parents got home late. But sometimes we just skipped school to do it. It started out small, with carving paths between these short palm trees. Four of them made a nice "room" area and you could carve paths between 2 to form "hallways." We worked on this for months. 

But the entrance was near our recess area and one day someone saw us going in. They of course told everyone and the next day at recess, dozens of kids are trampling over our fort. It hurt. It felt like an invasion of privacy. It was our hard work and they were trampling all over it. 

Well, as the administration does for harmless things  they over reacted and banned us from going in the forrest. A couple weeks later, caleb and I got a detention for being back there. 

That didnt stop us, that made us more determined. We would rebuild. We went further back into the forrest and found this place where someone dumped house construction scraps. Plywood and 2x4s and miscellaneous things. We started making a huge fort and using these things to build. The trees were taller further back and it was a heck of a challenge, but two kids with some determination can do alot over 2 years in middle school.   
























 That the world doesnt exist and was all made up around us a la Matrix style. Or even like The Truman Show. Imagine that the world really is a stage and everything is fake. Every friend you have is an actor, every place you have been to is a set, every road or plane flight you have been on has just been circles you drove in. What if the maps were wrong and that road trip you went on was just a loop that kept you in something the size of your state? What if every interaction you ever had was orchestrated by a producer of a show pulling the strings.

How would you know?

That is the biggest thing about this. The most appealing. How could I prove it, that it is all a lie. I used to think about this a lot in high school. We really would have no way to prove it. I ended up realizing that there is no point in thinking about it because there is no way to prove it sufficiently. 

And suppose it was matrix style. What if we were on a computer? Our brain is all electrical signals anyways, what if we were a brain in a lab being probed and every smell, image you see, thing you feel, idea you remember is an electrical signal coming from a computer putting it there. 

How can you prove that the world actually exists in the way we think it does? What if we were just some game, some 3rd grade martian's science fair project? We wouldn't know any better than a sim in your video game would.  




























































































































 i just dread when people ask me the "Where are you from?" question because i know where it goes every time.

 My bro and I used to be really close even though we were 9 years apart in age. His dad left our mom before he was even born and he never met him. My dad left when I was 2 and he was 11 and I barely remember him. Because of this my mom had to work two jobs to support us. One of those jobs was at this engineering company where she worked as a cleaning lady. She worked from 9pm to 5am as did all the cleaning staff so that they wouldn't disturb any of the engineers. 

Because of this, my bro and I would spend a lot of time together. We became really close and even though he had a decade on me, it wasn't like a weird father-son relationship where he had to take care of me. I bet I had to take care of him just as much as he did me. We would do whatever to calm the boredom of being alone so much

When we weren't getting in trouble, I remember we liked to play on a used n64 my mom got from one of her friends who's kid got a PS2 for christmas. We would play the crap out of it. We liked to play either mario64 or donkeykong64 and we would play on the same account to try to complete as much as we could as quickly as we could. When he couldn't beat something, I would, and vice versa. We also liked to jump this fence right next to our house that blocked off a canal. He would always have to help me up but once we were over we would play around over there. It was fun finding abandoned stuff like washing machines and other trash. We also would go in the forest and make forts. One time we found this place where someone dumped scraps from a house construction. We had a bunch of oddly shaped plywood boards and some 2x4s and made this huge fort. 

We would hang out there a lot until my uncle told me there were snakes over there and I was too afraid to go over again. 

Our song was Kyrptonite by 3DD. We started liking it when his friend got a playstation and we would go over and sing on singstar. We were always good at that song and put our entire effort into it. After a while we would just start randomly singing that song and it became *our song*.

In 2006 he went to college and left me. When he first left we would talk on the phone like every other day and he would fill me in his classes and tell me how different everything was. After enough time he started making new friends and our calls became weekly, then monthly, and when exams came we barely got to talk. His sophomore year I bought him the *The Better Life* CD for his birthday. I shipped it to him because he wouldn't be able to come home for his 20th birthday. 

He got it 3 days before his birthday and called me and we talked for hours. We hadn't talked in couple weeks so catching up was good. He was getting into the core classes and was learning VHDL which is a hardware description language that EE's use and he had to design a processor for a class. He was swamped with work but still talked to me. After so many years of listening to this song, we never had gotten the cd. 

He was going to college to become an Electrical Engineer because of the stories our mom told us about the engineers from her work. She would always describe the labs and the work on their white boards with us and always told us she wanted us to go to college. She wanted us to have a better life. The better life. The CD was perfect in every way. He wanted to help my mom move into a real house. He wanted to help pay her back for all what she had been through for us. He wanted her to never have to worry about money again. 

He told me about the processor project and about a solidstate class he was taking where he learned about the physics of transistors. He told me about the people he met at his school's IEEE club and about a design competition he wanted to enter. His team was considering something on placement aware devices. The idea was that if your phone could know where it was, it could change setting such as ring load if in a bag or vibrate softly if on a table. 

It was good to talk to him but that call, like all others, came to an end. 

Everything was normal for two years, we would talk occasionally, he would fill me in on the awesome things he was learning and I wouldn't have much to tell him about middle school but he would still listen and give advice. 

Two years later we got a call.

At 11pm an officer called. My mom was at work so I had to take it. He told me that my brother was in an accident and to notify my mom. I froze. I didn't believe him. I wanted it to be a joke. I hung up and collapsed on the floor crying. It felt like I was hit by a brick wall. I couldn't swallow, couldn't breathe, couldn't move. I felt cold and had no idea what to do. After I managed to stop crying I called my mom. She asked me if it was a small accident, if he was ok, or what. I repeated what the cop said, that he was in the hospital. That was all I knew or managed to understand from the cop. 

My mom got someone to take her work and my uncle drove us 5 hours to my brother's school. We had no idea what was happening in the mean time. My mom called the hospital a couple times and they updated her but didn't want to release too much over the phone or something. When we got to hospital at around 6am, a doctor told us he had died at 4:56. I remember it hadn't even been an hour so we must have gotten there a bit before 6am. A girl was leaving a party and was drunk and ran a red. My brother was on his way home from a lab and she crashed into him. The cops said she was speeding when she lost control and barrelled through the intersection. She had been ejected from her car and landed off to the side on the pavement. My brother was crushed in the car. 

After a couple months she recovered fine and was sentenced to probation. The judge said some bullshit about how she was a good student and this was her first offense. "The knowledge that you took someone's life was enough of a punishment." I was so mad that she got off so easily. I followed every news article relating to her, tried to get as much info about her, basically stalked her. She seemed so happy, had no remorse. She ruined our lives and gets to forget about it eventually. 

Thats what it is like to be 13 and lose your best friend. 

I eventually got over her a couple years ago. I finished high school last year. Life goes on. I got into my brother's college, started last semester, and I am going to be an Electrical Engineer too. There isn't a day I don't think of him. I want to get my EE degree for him. Do what he wanted and help my mom. 

To live a better life. 

I can't even listen to that song anymore. 

I will always miss you, superman.
