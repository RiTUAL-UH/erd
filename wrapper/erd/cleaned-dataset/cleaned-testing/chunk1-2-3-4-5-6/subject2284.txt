 well I'm sure you'll be very pleased at this ending then. 




 Unfortunately this really isn't a subjective thing, people can and will validly flag you for this. Nudity is a valid reason for a copyright strike, just the same as putting up licensed music unedited. Youtube doesn't give a damn about quality of content or power of creators, they just want the PR of saying 'your kiddywinkles won't see no boobs!" 




 Yeah, essentially any nudity shown for erotic purposes isn't allowed on youtube, this need to be fixed quickly sips. 




 If you tell him not to cheat, Simon will skin you and wear your head as a hat. 




 Oh God, I had this and the TPP reddit open in different tabs. THE WORLDS ARE MERGING! 




 That's what I tell myself about robocop 3, it was all just a dream wasn't it? 




 SHADOW OF ISRAPHEL CONFIRMED! TOMORROW AT 6! BE THERE OR BE SQUARE SUCKAS! I for one will be starving myself, waiting tfor the glory that is SOI to nourish me. 




 "SPAM IT! SPAM IT DUNCAN!"

 That's nothing compared to toady one, lone creator of Dwarf fortress. He's been making the worlds most realistic simulation game non-stop for 5 years now, and plans to work for another 15 




 Weirdest dream? Well it started out with me riding on the shoulder of a giant robot (It kinda looked like Gypsy danger from pacific rim,)  made out of bears,(And I don't mean teddy bears, I mean hyper realistic bears and all the bears were talking to me, with the voice of Nintendo characters, bears were talking to me with mario and princess peaches voice, saying things like 'how was your day, what are you so sad, can I have a chocolate sandwich please'

However, as the dream went on the robot made of bears started walking over a town , more specifically, Brighton, England, I had to keep ducking my head because for some reason, and I have no idea why, the people walking on the street, people I knew from school and stuff, were pulling out SNIPER RIFLES and specifically trying to shoot me. I didn't really care, as y'know, it was a weird ass dream, when I felt a really painful, dull thud in my head, in real life, I had woken up, tried to sit bolt upright (because that's what they do in movies) but had leaned too far forward and smacked my head into a wall, I went back into the dream, only this time things had changed. I was in a concentration camp, and this robot made out of bears was standing right next to me, but it was around my size (and thus composed of really tiny bears) The bears mouths were now full of blood, and against the wall of the concentration camp were all my fictional characters, everything my imagination had ever created. The Bear robot then spoke to me, with the nintendo characters, thousands of them, speaking at the same time like the voice of legion. It said "We are your new friends now, kill your old ones" (I even now think that my subconscious should have come up with better dialogue) I asked how I should kill them and it said "With an imaginary gun of course" 


And then the dream just ended, I woke up of course, and was left to look at the ceiling of my room. 




 SPOILERS! I'm actually hoping they screw up the main quest of this a couple of times, because you get sent back into Khare to travel the paths you didn't go first time around, which would provide a tonne more content. 




 Exactly, if you delve too far into these theories they eat themselves, as 'Simon and Lewis' aren't actually characters, they're avatars. Hell, if they were really tying up loose ends they would explain why Commander Riker was on an adventure with a dwarf. 




 Have you bought the DLC's? 'reefer madness' would be a cool one to see. 




 I would say that may not be the case any more, as once a twist is discovered pre-reveal(and this is fairly obviously the twist) some creators irrationally change it to keep ahead of the fandom. Some creators, not all mind you.  




 But Simon isn't necessarily going to 'roleplay' perfectly, remember from a meta perspective Yoglabs and SOI don't exist at all, it's just characters and roles. 




 That's because they're in the same genre, known as a MOBA, that was created by the original DOTA. Therefore, SMNC, Smite, LOL, and dota 2 all share ver similar mechanics. 




 I would love to see a playthrough of space marine. It's a perfect fit for Rythian 




 I've just finished playing sorcery 2. Can't wait to see them lose all there money, get thrown into sewers, try to become pirates and get turned into dogs. 




 I think you should E-mail the yogscast about this. A reddit post called 'a suggestion' isn't the best way to attract attention, but I wish you luck all the same! 




 You should have caught and trained that goblin. 




 Yeah, I'm sure Sjin will be JUST GREAT at the wonderful 101 




 Wallys loss was donut boy's gain! 




 Don't worry, I'm sure Lewis will be able to save them :3 




 Foolish Duncan! You have to hold a PIECE of space, like some moon rocks, then if you make a wish, you'll land.

It's really quite simple, It's frankly baffling the Yogscast haven't grasped it yet. 




 I may be in the minority here, but I don't think WOW is necessarily the most easily accessible or dynamic game. A lot of it revolves around mechanics that are simply arcane to a regular viewer. I would prefer to see you play another game with a similar theme, such as a single player RPG, roguelike, or non RPG MMO, it would be cool to see the yogscast develop guilds in planetside, DC universe or EVE for example. However, I would watch a WOW video if it had a podcast type format, with a raid in the background. That way, if people don't like WOW they can enjoy chatter with sips and the like, and if people do like WOW they can appreciate the stategy. 




 Hey Sips, seeing turbo Joe led to this, can this lead to Toribash, seeing as it also has stupid ragdoll physics and hyperviolence? More specifically, I think it would be cool if you tried out the popular 'duel sword' fighting online multiplayer that is popular with the kids these days. Not only would an online multiplayer game be revolutionary new content (Literally never seen before on Lets play!) but it would also be damn fun to watch you cut some poor clowns arm off. 




 Holy crap, Exalt WAS a nigerian Email scam! 




 I bet special agent Parvis is pissed. 




 But what about xcom Teep, I mean, he has those amazing hands for snipi- oh, wait, he doesn't anymore. 




 Hey, did you read my fictionalization of the CIV5 came I did? Reddit badly screwed up the paragraphing, but someone was kind enough to post a paragraphed version in the comments. You'd enjoy it. 




 It's worth noting that the old blip video player was IMO far more stable than youtube. And is still used occasionally today, I don't know many specifics, but maybe it can be set as a theme?  




 I swear, if youtube doesn't cut this crap out soon, there will be a mass migration to blip. 




 Cool, that's all I ask. Thanks for the reply! 




 But they were defending the block throughout the entire game, but this didn't count as a win condition because the attackers hadn't failed to STEAL the block. 




 I was trying to compose a comprehensive argument, as it's a game that needs some thought and reasoning applied to it, rather than 'play ac 4 pls' 




 OK, so I'm just going to say that I'm a huge fan of Dwarf fortress, and I personally think it's one of, if not the greatest roleplaying videogames ever made. I also love Rythians commentary and gameplay style; namely, cool, competent and collected, letting the games provide any humor, that's why I think Rythian should make and attempt to make a playthrough of Dwarf fortress, after he has of course learnt the game. Here are some of the Pro's and cons of doing a playthrough, for your consideration


Pros:
*Dwarf fortress lends itself extremely well to a continuation of the themes prevalent in the Xcom series, namely, the yogscast vs the world. Dwarf fortress is a game where you start with 7 dwarfs, which in the playthrough could be named after various important members of the yogscast. In game, these guys already have incredibly detailed personalities, backstories and abilities, and have to essentially build a fortress to protect themselves from the nasty, sprawling, world. This naturally lends itself to roleplay and hilarious events.


*Exclusivity. Dwarf fortress is traditionally seen as a game that doesn't lend itself to video lets play, and thus, very few lets plays have been attempted. However, at the moment, Rythian is in the exact right place to make a lets play of Dwarf fortress. His fanbase is much older than the 'main' yogscast fanbase, would be more welcoming of this style of game, and, as shown by Prison architect and towns, as well as Civ 5 to a lesser extent. Therefore, you have the perfect set of people to accommodate this game. Furthermore, the yogscast is in somewhat of a lull at the moment, with no major non MC series, Civ 5 is showing the live stream stuff and Sip's has stopped skyrim. Therefore, t's the perfect opportunity to make the next big series, something that Kid's will be talking about in playgrounds and saying "Holy shit guys, did you see the latest dwarf fortress ep where simon lost an arm and a leg? And lewis valiantlly sacrificed himself to save his friend from the Goblins? You have to watch it!"


*You're style of play naturally complements dwarf fortress. You're one of the most serious members of the yogscast, and tend to get heavily invested in the games you play. Therefore, the events of dwarf fortress will easily be able to allow you to show emotion in your lets play. For example, Elves in dwarf fortress will become deeply angered if you offer to sell them wood, sometimes even starting wars. So Rythian would be deeply shocked when elves start turning up his fortress RIDING UNICORNS and lay siege, and waste, to his fortress, even killing his hardened warrio dwarf, zoey Proasheck. Rythian swears revenge, and kills the next dwarven caravan to enter his base. When the next siege arrives, Rythian tries to set up an elaborate lava trap to kill them all, however, this backfires and ends up killing everyone. I mean, How cool would that be? And it doesn't need an elaborate script, it just needs Rythians personality and a copy of Dwarf fortress.


Cons:
*Graphics, I'm not going to deny that Dwarf fortress isnt the prettiest game in the world, or the most visually friendly to a casual viewer, however, mods like this [lazy newb pack]
(http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=126076.0)
Help to alleviate the problem by making DF simple and cleaner, with a better tileset and more utilities.


*Time and work investment, similar to the above, DF takes quite a while to learn how to play, and will require a significant time and work investment to be able to play properly, although it's not as intimidating as it initially seems. But oh, Rythian, the results are glorious


*Down time in videos. When stuff is going hilariously wrong/right in DF it's some of the most entertaining stuff in games, but when You're just managing boring things like stone stockpiles and the like, it can get kind of tedious.  see 3 ways to alleviate this:
1.Play in an evil biome, where stuff is going wrong all the time, and things are always trying to kill you
2. Edit the boring stuff out in videos, although this should be a last resort.
3. Always be working towards some grand goal, such as a 'fuck the world' magma cannon or megaproject, which will help keep the series focused.


All in all,  I definitely think the eventual Pros of this risk will longterm outweigh the Cons, and I think this will be a series people will want to see in their inbox, and look forward to at the end of a long day of work. 




 Because It's not making them 'think they're winning' It's just letting them win, deliberately putting yourself at a disadvantage for no apparent reason. Besides, they weren't whining and breaking the rules to win, they were disillusioned by the very concept of the adventure map being against them, and the fact red team is able to do all kinds of strategies, where theirs are limited to letting them take blocks, and then hopefully killing them. 




 But that's a stupid idea for a game. Defenders need to defend, they shouldn't need to think up Bond villain strategies to win a game when the other team can't actually get the iron due to their own lack of ability. 




 I'd a;also like to point out that Rythian was obviously the most experienced, and was the only player other than zylus to know what the super bar did, and the only player to know how to charge it. 




 This was a really great Tournament, It's really fun and tense to watch 1v1 yogscast videos like this. I would love to see more of divekick, and I would also suggest Toribash (Sword fight or normal, could make for some interesting fights) and Nidhogg. 




 They did for wonderful 101 




 Or a lego videogame, that could have lots of lego talk. 




 Sips, please play lego marvel Super heroes! You can play as the hulk and smash shit! you can fly about and blow stuff up as Iron man! You can swing on buildings as spiderman! Plus, it has co-op, so you can do this with your best bud Sjin! But seriously, iit would make as marvelous playthrough, with plenty of lego talk, hilarious moments and a fast pace. 




 But redshirt could be argued to be as much of a member of 'team yogscast' as teep, being an ascended extra. Zhang is just an unrelated x com character 




 Thank you so much for this, I actually really appreciate it. 




 Reddit screwed it up. It was originally formatted in word, I have done a hasty edit. 




 Ok, So I thought I would post my epilogue to the Last Civ 5 game here. I haven't done a hugely through editing Job and It was written on word, so reddit may screw things up. If that is so, please forgive me for it, please.

Lewis was kicking pebbles on the sands of the 'for sale $10' shore, his last city due to the peace treaty. That damns peace treaty! He thought to himself, cursing his rotten luck, why, why, why had he decided to start that blasted war, when he knew that damn dutch venetian alliance was unbeatable if they worked together? He supposed that was the problem really, if they had been at each others backs like he expected them to, he could have swooped in and taken world leadership for himself! He could just imagine it, sipping cocktails from his own private brewery in his tundra palace, eating the best butts from France, the crabs from the dutch, and watching that sniveling toad Rythian of cry-venitian-penissulababia grovel and beg for support. Instead, he gets this shitty, hot Island in the middle of nowhere, and this weird, grey, spongy mass at his feet rather than his beloved snow. What the hell was this stuff anyway? Aren't beaches supposed to have sand on them? He should ask sips about it, he has been on the island longer than him.

"Hey sips, what the hell is this stuff that's on the ground everywhere! Lewis hollered over to the other side of the island, which, as for sale $10 was only around 500 foot across, wasn't saying much.
"I don't go by that name anymore, use my real name"
"'sigh' please tell me the meaning of this mysterious substance, oh holy ruler of France, eater of the finest butts, the best guy, the real guy, the big bastard himself, sips"
Thank you, jeez, you'd think a little formality would be in order when addressing the true ruler of this island"
"You sold it to me for free! You didn't even sell it for 10 buck!" Lewis replied angrily, the worst thing about this was that, in some respects, sips was right, he was the equal proprietor of the Island, and, since they were both effectively immortal without the intervention of serious firepower, that was unlikely to change anytime soon. So what did you want to talk to me about, you want in on my super-duper top secret plan?!?!?!?" Lewis jumped, he still hadn't gotten used to how small the island was, and Sips' appearance was, frankly, frightening. He was entirely, naked, aside from a small reed skirt, had somehow gotten tattoos on his knuckles with fuckin' a and fuckin' b on the side, and had a chest tattoo simply stating his French national anthem:

*Big money
*Big women
*Big fun

However, by far the most disturbing aspect of his appearance was his, disgusting patchy beard. Lewis, having been bestowed with a magnificent, well-kept beard since beard since birth, was appalled by the conditions this innocent creature living on sips face had been subjected to.
Sips, please just tell me what the crap were standing on is, and maybe Ill listen to your plan Lewis was exasperated, how many days had he been stuck on this island, having to look at that beard, listening to sips ramble on about how he beat pyrion in an arm wrestle for control of China. Worse still, despite his best efforts, the state of his own beard was rapidly deteriorating, what will happen when his only remaining pride and joy had no pride, nor joy, placed into its upkeep? 
Sips looked around at his surroundings for a while, poking the grey mass with his toe. Lewis observed that it looked buoyant enough to not take in water, perhaps it was some mystical substance that the French people had invented, about to be used for a mobile battalion of Islands? Jeez, I dont know everything, guy, it was like this when I built this city, why would I sell this for $10 otherwise? Im not an idiot, Im a savvy genius that will one day rule the world, I mean super planet 3 million has been foretold by eat a butt as the successor to terra or whatever the planet is called nowadays, I mean, this may look bad for me now guy, but I have access to the most valuable resource in the world, and therefore the greatest superweapon, for sale $10 has ever seen! I mean, you didnt think I wasnt doing anything while you guys were just ignoring me did you, Im an enterprising individual!
For some inexplicable reason sips, your words dont exactly fill me with confidence
Well if youre not going to use my full title, you obviously dont have faith in me, spaceguy of the Girl Guide Corporation At those words, sips ran away, off to his end of the island, whilst Lewis again started absent-mindedly kicking pebbles, willing something, anything, to happen.
 Astonishingly, at that very thought, the sound of metal cutting through the sea was brought to his ears. A battleship! Come to rescue him and take him away from this dreadful pla- oh, It was Duncans, as identified by the hasty paintjob of a skull and crossbones on its side, as well as a plank, waiting for people to walk it. Its large speakers spread the sound of Duncan the Pirate kings voice over thousands of Mile of Sea as Lewis realized something: This wasnt his saviour, it was his tormentor.

Ahem, uh hello, I mean ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRR YA SCURVY KNAVES DONE BEEN MESSING AROUND WITH ME TREASURE HOARD, AND NOW YE PAY THE PRICE OF FAILURE 
Duncan, please, just let me talk over the intercom. Theres a reason Im world leader
NAY!!  YE BE A CONNIVING, LIMY SOD, AND SOON YE BETRAY ME JUST LIKE SJIN! IT IS JUST AS THE EAT A BUTT PROPHECY FORETOLDYE-At this point, Lewis could quite audibly hear a loud scuffle over the announcer, when it next came back, he could hear rythians, smoother, calmer demeanour over the audio. Anyway, what Duncan was meant to say was that Sjin betrayed the Shoshone/Venetian/Dutch/ Moroccan alliance, and for that he has, unfortunately, been sentenced to walk the plank. Let this be a lesson to you all, my words are backed with nuclear weapons! 
You broke your own damn alliance by kicking me out to this Island! Lewis furiously shouted back, hoping desperately that Rythian would be able to hear. Oh what was that Lewis? We betrayed you? Well tell that to the people of Prague. Prague remembers. My words are backed by nuclear weapons! Rythian was mocking Lewis, but Lewis had no leverage. It was hopeless. Sjin was on the deck now, walking slowly across the plank, and fear in his eyes. The Dutch pirates, with tiny tulips attached to their cutlasses (not even dutch, thought Lewis) were edging Sjin closer and closer to the end of the plank, whilst doing terrible impressions of Pirates. Lewis Knew he couldnt let Rythian and the worlds worst pirate king do this to Sjin, his only friend and ally, so he did the only thing he could, he picked up the Largest object he could find, a tiny pebble, and threw it directly at duncans ship making a small chink noise as it bounced harmlessly off the destroyers bow. DUNCAN, YOU ARE A TERRIBLE PIRATE KING, A TERRIBLE WORLD LEADER, AND A TERRIBLE DUTCHMANbefore long, a terrible, bellowing voice came from the bowels of the battleship. The Duncmeister obviously hadnt been allowed access to the pa system again. WHOS BEEN QUESTIONING MY AUTHORITY OVER THE GREATEST MAN THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN! CONQUERER OF BOTH LEWIS AND SJIN! DUNCAN THE  UNSTOPPABLE?
I have Duncan, and you may strike me down, but I will become stronger than you can even imagine Lewis was making stuff up as he went along, wasnt there something in eat a butt about reincarnation? Uh, Lewis, you do realize, that, theyre arent like respawns in this game, if I kill you, you die, thats it 
Yeah, get him boss! said Sjin, rather feebly; he wasnt sure who he should be a lackey for.
Im done playing these games after your INSOLENCE lewis! I mean, ARRRR, we give you dis bootiful Tropical paridise, and dis is how ye repay us? I do believe they be a double execution today boys!
Well, you may, want to rethink that strategy, Duncmeister, because I have a superweapon trained on your ship at this very moment
Ok Lewis, har har, youve had your fun, but come on we all know you dont have a superweapon Duncan had walked up to the top deck now, Flanked by Rythian, who had a tired, exasperated look that only the partners of the pirate king could know
I DO BELIEVE, I CAN ANSWER THAT PARTICULAR QUESTION said a voice lewis hadnt heard in a long time; Stepping out of the bushes, garbed in full navy uniform and a sword that seemed to be glowing with energy, was pyrion flax.  However, the most fascinating thing about Pflaxs appearance was his beard, which was extremely long and grey. So long, in fact, that It almost seemed to trail off into infinity. And thats Lewis realized to his horror, what he was standing on. He wasnt standing on an island, he was standing on pyrion flaxes beard.
Ysee Duncan, whilst you were away from me, I was here, getting XP and Gold in the Jungle, getting Items and levels. And now, its time to take out the trash

Pyrion, what the Fuck are you talking about, this isnt Dota 2 either. My words are backed by nuclear weapons Duncan just seemd to be annoyed by the lack of executions and Rythian was clearly shaken, but Pyrion was oblivious to his words. He was running across the beach at great speed, his sword in the air, running straight at Duncans ship. Apparently ignorant to the several miles of sea between him and Duncan. As soon as he reached the water, he ran straight in, not even bothering to attempt to swim, until he was completely submerged, and didnt surface again. 
Um, ok. On with the current, scheduled, uh, execution of Sjin
Hold it right there! Despite being Miles apart, Lewis, Sjin, Rythian and Duncan all had the same thought: oh no, not again Out of the jungles of the island came a huge monstrosity, a Kaiju in all but name. Sips had found the rarest and best luxury in Civ 5. He had found a giant crab.
At that moment, everyones unanimous second thought was Fuck it after that, everything became jumbled. Rythian pulled a nuclear detonation device from his coat, evidently having gone mad, and trying to kill himself, the crab, and everyone who would remember this mess. Duncan, unsurprisingly, didnt take kindly to this revelation, and was trying to fight his way through to rythian, past his royal guard Sips, who had apparently gained control of the crab and was putting down a helpful claw for Sjin to latch on to
Dont worry Sjin, that nuke wont be able to hurt us, this crab is protected against uranium!
Whos ranium?
Whatre you doing in Tehran Sjin?
Lewis was panicking, and running from one end of the small Island to the other, He had no idea what was going on the crab seemed to have eaten sjin, and Sips was climbing into its mouth to be engulfed. Duncan had had finally managed to fight his way to Rythian, and was wrested control of the detonator. Lewis saw something out of the corner of his eye; pyrion was alive and climbing up the side of the battleship!
And that was when Lewis set his master plan into motion. The crab was immune to uranium and (presumably) radiation, Rythian was trying to kill everyone, but would only really kill himself and Duncan, and Duncan had secured the nuclear detonator but was standing perilously close to the edge of the ship that pyrion was climbing up. If Duncan and Rythian died, he would be able to restore glory to the glorious Moroccan empire! 
Hey Duncan! I have an important message for you! Duncan looked around to see lewis, ignorant of the peril coming to get him from below. Cant it wait Lewis?
No, its vitally important for the safety of humanity
Fine, tell me!
Work the shaft and cup the balls
What happened next would remain with Lewis for the rest of his(extremely short) Life. Pyrion grabbed both of Duncans legs, and dragged him into the sea. Duncan attempted to fight back, and then swim away, but both of them were becoming tangled in Pyrions enormous beard, and they were engulfed by the sea, twisting into the Darkness below. Rythian grabbed the detonator and jammed his hand on the button; the sky became filled with the hum of nuclear missiles. For the first time in days, Lewis was happy; all he needed to do was ask sips for admission into his bizzare crab creature mouth. Sorry guy no can do, you should have shown me more respect, and I always have a plan.
Oh, oh no.  Actually, you know what?  I dont want to rule a world with Giant crabs and a crab based economy. Fuck it. I can win the next Civ game.

And with that dear reader, Sipsco dirt factory conquered the world, The nuclear bombs lit up oblivion. Sjin took for sale $10, and sips took the rest of the world. In some ways, everyone was happy, but, on the other hand, Im guessing theyll be lots of grudges in the next civ game
Because, yknow, Im sure the yogscast will DEFINITELY take this work of fiction on reddit into account.
 




 Well He didn't give me the money to buy the Meld, however, Simon will be... appropriate payment.

I remain 




 Karl Pilkington need an antagonist. Lewis and Simon are far too polite to fill that role. 




 Ok guys, I've been caught with my trousers down, I haven't been able to make a Civ game 'epilogue' like last game because I thought this game would end on Friday. However! I Can write an epilogue in a reddit post, or just put it at the next games first episode's reddit comments. 




 Everyone ignores sips, you just know he's building nukes. 




 It may be wishful thinking on my part, but I would really like to see the xcom units and giant robots brought into this game. I also plan to write a short story to wrap up the last episode like I did with the last Civ game. 




 Nah, sips has this in the bag. 




 Well that's the problem, LLTQ has objectively less content, and, if you played princess maker, you'd know that the amount of content/endings is the best part of the game 




 Long live the queen just isn't very good in it's 'genre'. Being based on an old SNES game called princess maker 2 but having much less functionality and gameplay length. 




 Okay, sorry about this repost from the democracy 3 thread, but I really think you should put this game up for consideration. I think your main strength is that you're an amazingly entertaining character on your own merit, thus, you need a game where funny events naturally happen, rather than as part of cutscenes and setpieces, to help your style of editing and commentary really shine, hence my suggestion

**dwarf fortress**
now, I fully understand that dwarf fortress is a complicated game to play, learn and understand (although not really more complicated than democracy) but this can be greatly alleviated by a few simple mods, and the role playing potential is so great i honestly believe it become the next 'fan favourite' yogscast series(ala skyrim and civ 5) for example, many of the things sips speculates about his towns members doing in towns are actually possible in df. you can name a dwarf uthgerd, give her the name uthgerd, she can get married to old beardo, give birth on a dinner table to uthgerdbeardo3million, have her fight a giant elephant, lose an arm, become the fortresses chief medic, and then become a wearboar(because a wearboar fell into her personal water supply the previous) go beserk and and kill a bunch of elves, all before being killed by uthgerdbeardo3million whilst he's still a baby. the possibilities are literally limitless. I know you've talked about df before in towns,and i think you may have been distracted by it's complexity, but if you liked diplomacy, I will **guarantee** you'll love dwarf fortress
just give it a try ya' magnificent bastard. 




 But why would he need to when I am already sending my men into his base to help him 'secure' the meld? 




 Nein! Ich Bin 100% canadian. 




 Greeting friend!

It has come to my attention that you are short on meld,a disastrous occurrence that puts any persons life on hold.However, I have just inherited my fathers small fortune, and would be able to buy plenty of meld for you and all of your xcom operatives, however, times are tough in my country, and, as Canada is a harsh and desolate place, I have not been allowed access to this vast supply of meld, and may not be for quite some time. However, we must always look to tomorrow! All I need to put the political cogs into motion is for you to tell me the location of your precious xcom base, and I can send a few of my men to 'ahem' Finalize the arrangement.

_Zips
Ceo and head of Exalt operations Canada, and proprietor of _zipsco gravel

I remain 




 And so ends the fall from grace of Sips, the greatest leader France ever saw, conqueror of China, master negotiator, passionate leader, and all round big bastard! Take heed children! Learn your lesson from sips's greed and avarice, and above all, if a strange bald man with a beard offer to let you own 'all of his China' it will probably end badly. 




 So Duncan was trying to kill martin freeman? I knew it!
 




 I liked the concept and idea of a game where you run the country, however, in execution, it was made up of less of the kind of comedy policies you would expect sips to implement ("Free dirt for everyone!") and more of pleasing trade unionists. It was too complicated to be comedically pleasing. However, I do present sips a pitch for a game he could play which would replicate the ideals of the redditors who wanted him to play democracy, namely, terrible decisions affecting people with hilarious consequences, I realize it's not the best game VISUALLY but the potential is such that I want sips to at least give it a try.

**Dwarf fortress**

Now, I fully understand that dwarf fortress is a complicated game to play, learn and understand (Although not really more complicated than democracy) but this can be greatly alleviated by a few simple mods, and the role playing potential is **so** great I honestly believe it become the next 'fan favourite' yogscast series(ala Skyrim and Civ 5) For example, many of the things sips speculates about his towns members doing in Towns are **actually possible** in DF. You can name a dwarf Uthgerd, give her the name uthgerd, she can get married to old beardo, give birth on a dinner table to uthgerdbeardo3million, have her fight a giant elephant, lose an arm, become the fortresses chief medic, and then become a wearboar(because a wearboar fell into her personal water supply the previous) go beserk and and kill a bunch of elves, all before being killed by uthgerdbeardo3million WHILST HE'S STILL A BABY. The possibilities are literally limitless. I know you've talked about DF before in towns,and I think you may have been distracted by it's complexity, but if you liked diplomacy, I will **Gaurantee** You'll Love Dwarf fortress

Just give It a try ya' magnificent bastard.  




 I think the problem is that everyone is POTENTIALLY on the same skill level, but are less 'tryhard' than lewis, Nobody is really trying to beat lewis, as they know that it won't make an entertaining video if everyone gangs up. 




 So the real world equivalent of this is essentially America giving up in world war 2 and giving the entire continent to sweden. 




 Rythian seems to be one of the best players in the civ 5 series, but refuses to EVER stop turtling, for no apparent reason. 




 Yeah, I had a guy who did that decide we should only use agility heroes, because, in his own words, "I've never lossed with it before and if we get farm we're op." We lost, horribly. 




 So just before I was about to go to sleep, I had a moment of inspiration. Rythian should do a playthrough of IJI! Iji is a little known indie freeware game, and a sort-of combination of RPG and Metroidvania. I would quite like to not spoil any more than that, but It would be an excellent series for Rythian to do. It's short,(5-6 hours) has lot of surprises, excellent gameplay, and, more importantly, moral choices and an intriguing story! I really think he should check it out. 




 So is everyone going to be really rusty for the livestream episode? 




 Great! Thank you for the reply, it would be awesome to see a playthrough of SMT x fire emblem whenever that comes out. 




 OK, I will admit somebody has probably already asked for this in some capacity, but after watching him mention it in CIV I think it would be really cool to see Rythian play fire emblem, It would be a really cool follow up to X-com, wouldn't be flagged by nintendo (It's not on the list of games you're not allowed to make money from recording) and you could have even more Iron Man shenanigans than X-com. I gathered from Civ that You'd presumably finished awakening, but honestly you can play every fire emblem in a completely different way, and the series could last for ages with all the DLC's, particularly with all the entertaining and fun rommances and role play.

PS. I realize that this should have really been on the game suggestions thread, but I thought you wouldn't notice due to that thread being a month old. 




 Political affiliations are VERY poor between japan and those two countries due to various wars and nasty stuff. I wouldn't be surprised if Japan needs its own server due to racially motivated attacks from players in China and South Korea (although I'm sure it's not entirely one sided) It's not pretty, but reckon it may be the problem. 




 Tangos were significantly buffed. 




 There's nothing more satisfying from flaring someone on the top tower before the game even starts. 




 Well looks like it's another one of these:

 Beyond NEVER changes the story, The actions of being homeless are essentially slightly different alternative actions, The ryan choice I was talking about was how leaving the bar in a scene(completely arbitrarily) is the only way to keep the relationship open in the ending. Saving one person over the other in walking dead completely changed scenes and kept them alive for 1 and a half episodes to interact with other characters. In Beyond, you can't even die, and choices are ignored that even the most idiotic writer would think of, for example, the party scene has you choose some music, a action that doesn't matter and only wastes your time, BUT what if, for example, Jodie listened to that genre of music you choose all throughout the game; that's far more meaningful than almost every other 'choice' in the game. 




 Really? I watched VGA play it and Literally every choice was heavily signposted and didn't change the overall story at all, Walking dead brought up your choices all the time, whereas in beyond the only real significant choice I saw was whether you got with Ryan or not. 




 Barely any,because it sucked. 




 Yeah but You weren't separated by 20 kills with none of there towers down and 4 people. 




 I think the game whose name duncan was searching for was bionic commando.  




 Rythian,sips,sjin,zoey and nilesy on sipsco, duncan, lewis,simon,turps and strippin on giel guide corporation. Hannah can do commentary. 




 I wanna see some clockwerk, those cogs and flairs are a recipe for hilarity.
 




 She could commentate instead if they really wanted a fair game. 




 I would like to see a ten man dota2 game, which would be easy to edit and lots of fun to watch. 




 Love Monster Hunter! Love to see it with other yogscast members.
 




 It's incredible how youtube seems to know nothing about people who view Youtube videos other than cute cats. 




 I wish Ridge had helped sips and sjin. Derping around is fine, but when they spend so much time making a flashily designed spy car that they can't create so they have to give up without anyone else seeing it, It can be a bit tiresome. 




 Pretty dick move by Lewis to Fire him right after Simon let him join, Why did Simon send that E-mail then? 




 Why aren't they using the lighting mods anymore? Those sunsets and coral reefs seem perfect for them.
 




 I'm glad lewis got reprimanded for attempting to get in the flying machine. Man was not meant to fly, dwarfs were. 




 Funnily enough, and this may be off-topic, but I've actually written a comic, and it should be coming to the webcomic space soon! 




 Especially as from a metagaming sense Stanley canonically has a wife. 




 The apartment ending is terrifying.

 It only applies to videos **without** commentary. The garrys incident stuff was the devs being douchebags. Beside, nintendo doesn't take videos down, they're just allowed free advertising on them. 




 As Duncan stared at lewis from across the table, his eyes painted a portrait, a portrait of a man who led his country to war, with disastrous consequences. A man whose adamant refusal to focus on anything other than science led to widespread famine and drought. "Where did it go wrong?" He mutters to himself, as he takes a laser pen out of his scraggly beard to sign the peace treaty. He hadn't heard from queen sjinsabella of Spain in years, rumor has it she left to the new world with a device to live forever, he wishes he had invented that, but alas,ultimately all that science had led to was a cool pen. If only he had followed religion, apparently he defeated that treacherous Rythian of Crybabia in a mighty battle in a previous life, or so he claimed as the reason for his treachery.

" Are you going to sign it or what, Duncan" said Lewis indignantly, Duncan being little more than a cockroach, wasting his time in its death thoes. "I have a international games in Tesco to attend, y'know **your** city."Rythian began to laugh, a cold, crooked laugh. Duncan didn't say a word, he pressed the laser pen to paper, felt the weight of the dynamite against his chest, and put his thumb over the detonator concealed in the pen.

"TESCO REMEMBERS BIATCH"  Said Duncan as he jammed his hand onto the detonator. As he was engulfed in the ensuing explosion, he knew he had finally won.

In the end it was sips who took over the leaderless byzantine states, and led the world into a better tomorrow,but he knew making the world a fuckin' paradise was only down to Duncans sacrifice. 




 The co- optional podcast was flagged by a bot, and they're now allowed to profit from it and of course, you again ignore the fact that the co-optional podcast was the first time CROSS THE ENTIRETY OF POLARIS that nintendo's policy affected them.Entitled gamers like to think that the big,bad corporation is out to get them, but non commentary playthroughs of MK 7 not being profitable doesn't affect them at all. 




 From another board:Turns out this is not a unique thing. In fact, this is industry wide practice. Nintendo have simply finally decided to do what the rest of the industry already does. If you read the terms of Youtube's monetization service it says:


This is something that other publishers have already been following. This is the reason why networks like Machinima have licensing agreements with game companies in the first place. This is, at this point, standard industry practise, and I think it reflects poorly on every journalist who took this and tried to portray it as some unique attempt by Nintendo to shut down Lets Plays.

Removed the rest of my post, as at this point, it's irrelevant. Nintendo are simply doing what every other game company does. The only exceptions that I can see are Valve, Minecraft and FTL.

So to everyone huffing and saying how they're going to swear off Nintendo for this, I hope this is now going to extend to every other publisher or developer working in the industry.

Furthermore, the only games you can't make money from advertising are very recent games with no commentary, such as mario kart 7, games that weren't being picked up by LPers anyway. Of course, everyone misinterpreted it as THEY WON'T LET ME SHOW MA GAMES EHRMAGAD. 




 Yeah, because not being able to make advertising money from mario kart 7 totally affected the yogscast. 




 From the way they talk about it, all of them already know, and it would only take an hour or two off-screen. 




 also everyone's adamant refusal to play dwarf fortress. 




 The way none of them know much about videogame news and going on, but they all state the bits and pieces of hearsay as fact, like 'we can't record nintendos e3 booth or we'll be banned' 




 That was almost how sips won the last game. Shame they didn't realize the game wasn't over yet. 




 Will Rythians racial(more oil) ever come into play in this series?
 
























 But if you look into it to this extent, twisting facts to warp the show to your worldview, at no benefit to the story, it's utterly pointless, a waste of your time and a waste of mine. 




 Because of course DISGUISING herself as a male character, despite the fact she still used a female bathroom is conclusive, fullproof evidence. 




 Nui uses Female bathrooms, has a female voice, wears a dress, has been depicted nude, has breasts, has a favourite colour of pink, describes herself as female... I could go on. What does the series gain from this twist? Absolutely nothing, there's no male NUI subtext, there's no context, it would just piss people off. Face facts, you theory just doesn't work. You can write a fanfiction about it, but it will never, **ever** be canon. 




 So, since I don't have any Kill la kill episodes to wait all week for, I've decided to develop a comprehensive schedule for myself for life after Kill la kill


Monday: Madoka Magicka: Looks like a pretty sweet little magical girl series, should be fun!


Tuesday:Attack on Titan: Continues action and mild apocalyptic/fantasy flavor of kill la kill, also highly critically acclaimed


Wednesday: Claymore: The first anime I ever watched, so I'm watching it again. Continues action girl, dark elements of kill la kill


Thursday: Bakenmonogatari: Highly acclaimed, anime I'm personally interested in


Friday: gurren lagaan: A nice anime to round out my Friday, nice to get some hype for my weekend


Saturday: Space Dandy: Basically my saturday night comedy


Sunday: Sakura trick: Heard good things. I also want to create maximum contrast with madoka mondays


Basically, I want to watch acclaimed anime every day, but from every end of the spectrum, from light to dark, any comments/advice? 




 We need more deep, detailed roleplay, with developed characters like this in the yogscast. I mean, you guys just keep upping you game, first SOI, the Yogsquest, and now Zachs reddit links to erotica. I think this your peak, your magnum opus. 




 I think it should mainly be role playing games, since Yogscast is, in my opinion, about role play. 




 BUT THEY NEVER IMPLIED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE! There's literally no evidence for it, it's not a theory, it's fanfiction, that's not a bad thing, but  there is not a single thing in dialogue or imagery to indicate Nui being male other than Nui not being overly sexualized (and NUI's distaff counterpart, Mako, wasn't either, and we know she's not a boy). **Even if** it was a twist for the OVA or word of God, everyone would say it's bullshit, because there has been no foreshadowing. 




 Yep, immediately after the last episode, people were declaring the ship dead. However, people started to reinterpret and analyze, and suddenly, it was back afloat, and now the community is going to shit. 




 The series is over, if she was a boy, they would have said, or at least giving some direct implication. 




 I think the OVA will be plot pivotal. 
*If Rei lives through that OVA, we will get a series 2
*If rei dies, we will not get a season 2 **with these characters**
*If rei dies, and their are no more story breadcrumbs/loose ends, it's over, and we should look forward to triggers next anime.
 




 We don't know if that was the 'date' in question though. The ED obviously took place quite a while after the finale, whereas the 'date' was implied to be a more spur of the moment, immediate thing. 




 Because for both sides there's *just* enough evidence to make you think it's open and shut. 




 Is't it weird how everyone thought the gamako was sunk after the episode and now everyone's saying the Ryumako is sunk? 




 Apparently it is actually a translation error or the word 'Deito.' In my opinion, that makes a lot of the final scenes a lot less dramatic, but oh well. 




 OK, that makes much more sense, as that's a translation error, however, I would still say that still doesn't CONFIRM or disprove any ships, as we have no idea when the ending ED is set. (presumably, in my opinion, the 'date' isn't shown in the epilogue, as it's obviously set way after the ending, whereas the dialogue implied that the 'date' would be a more immediate, spontaneous thing)  The ending will still ultimately, be ambiguous, and I actually think that's a bit gutless, but oh well. 




 I'm not serious, if you notice the alliteration, I was comparing that Hypothetical to the equally unlikely hypothetical of 'It's just a friendship kiss guys!' Hence why I think that Neither was definitely confirmed, because you can trade tit for tat shipping comments all day long. 




 I'm a massive gamer, from dwarf fortress to Okami, what sort of games are you thinking? TF2? 




 Early credits is Ryuko's imagined, perfect past when she was being mind controlled by Ragyo and had her memories changed. The second ED is her actual life after the events of the season, hence why it has a happier, sweeter atmosphere. 




 She'll die in the OVA. 




 I'm not disregarding evidence, I'm just saying that saying 'Mako kissing Ryuko was just Mako being Mako' is just the same as saying 'Gamgoori was just gonna give flowers to Satsuki, who he has been trying to protect for years now' I just don't understand why you assume that GamagooriXMako was confirmed when there's no real concrete evidence for it. 




 But we **Don't** know he was going to ask her out, we also only know he was fond of her, but no direct romantic interest. 




 There's no concrete evidence for the Gamagoori thing either, if you can say that Mako openly kissing Ryuko was platonic, you can also say that Gamagoori was trying to present flowers to Satsuki, or that if he had tried to ask Mako out, she would have refused. 




 So I was wondering if the use of the word 'date' has the same connotations in Japan as it does elsewhere, as I think it would be helpful to know if it had an odd translation in the sub, or some hidden cultural meaning or whatever.

Basically, I would like discuss, from a purely rational perspective, whether the ending actually confirms ANYTHING about the shipping war stuff, or at least stop people from assuming that the term 'date' was used in a platonic sense from the get-go.

 




 Mako has shown no romantic feeling for Gamagoori, and there's the fact that the Mako is the only person capable of cooling down ryuko from brainwashing, and Ryuko keeps talking in anticipation of the date in the finale... and there's the kissing stuff, and the nosebleeds in earlier episodes, and the fact there is no canon confirmation of Gamagoori's LOVE for mako.

I don't think still supporting the Makogoori ship is unjustified, but saying it's the only canon ship is ludicrous,and there was no need to make that derogatory comment, I'm simply saying that if characters specifically talking about a DATE, they might be talking about, y'know, a date.

Im simply arguing from a state of rationality, I'm not shipping anyone, I'm simply stating that I think there's more evidence for the Mako Ryuko stuff than to the contrary, but neither has ultimately being exclusively confirmed. 




 Depends what rei does in the OVA IMO, if she gets defeated, no season 2. 




 I think it will be half and half. If rei doesn't turn up, it's essentially a given there'll be a season 2. Remember, Rei said in ep 22 that her life wasn't important as long as the life fibres achieve domination. 




 But there isn't an indication that the ED shows the 'date' anyway. I'm sorry, but the terminology would not be used if it was platonic. 




 Exactly! Mako, in a friendly way, handstitched M's onto Ryuko ass! It's the only logical explanation! 




 I think Rei will feature heavily in the OVA. She's a massive loose end. Perhaps the OVA may be exclusively about her. 




 Those are Friendship M's! Friendly M's! 




 Doubtful. Disney does develop adult properties through paramount anyway. What will likely happen is greater synergy of TV and maker studios content. 




 Guessing the reason she was cultivated, alone with some of Ragyo and Nui's backstory, will be given in the last episode. 




 Neir, a fairly obscure JRPG, had a secret ending when you got 100% To get there, you had to essentially complete this 50 hour game 4 times. However, the ending is heartbreaking, and you have to choose whether to sacrifice your character to save the world. If you choose to THE GAME DELETES EVERY SAVE FILE IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE. Hundreds of hours, and all that remains is a lotus flower on the title screen. 




 It's the perfect size for a run.  In Britain, the most successful shows manage to achieve that over. **4 years** Besides, you get a whole new series from trigger every year anyway, and 24 is just enough to leave you satisfied but appreciating the conclusion. 




 I actually made a speculation post for her a week or two ago, and I'm happy with her character usage. She saved Nui and Ragyo from death, and she probably has some backstory coming next episode. It seems to me that she was a sacrificial lamb bred to power up Ragyo, and she was grown specifically to fill the roles nui and Ragyo couldn't. 




 Not dead actually, powering up Ragyo 




 That, in my opinion, is an example of the kind of elitism that puts people off anime. Anime is just programming, it has good and bad elements too. Those people who you see as watching 'reality TV' may actually be watching breaking bad or some other great show, but you misbrand it as something you hate whilst they brand anime as the 'naughty tentacles.' You can't expect people to culturally accept your media when you don't accept theirs. 




 I'm a primary wiiu gamer, and hate programming, but I love DF 




 I doubt the series will go into space, if they do follow up on that plotline, it almost certainly won't be with the same characters as this series. Remember, Kill la kill's world has shown no evidence of advanced space travel, Even the nudist beach ship, which is the result of Billions of dollars and insane amounts of intelligence, is still a regular boat with a rocket sword mode.  




 Who's ranium? 









 Hooray! One episode closer to dwarf fortress (hopefully) 




 I personally doubt the nui one. She's the combination of some guys sperm and a hive mind race bent on killing everyone in the universe to propagate itself. She's also a deliberate pragmatist, and would have killed ryuko multiple times without intervention. She doesn't give a damn about relationships. 




 I would definitely say it's a longer game, but the fact you can just brute force it, and get different results each day, means that they'll definitely be able to complete it. 




 I think Rei may be involved in a twist involving this, that, or she dies horribly next episode.  




 But, if you don't reload and get tot he end each time, you essentially get a new narrative whilst looking for the spell lines anyway. There are also multiple ways to get each one. 














 Called it. 




 That Great scientist wasn't capture by Barbarians, he actually retreated to a cave to discover the secrets of time travel. 




 Try Moon Knight or Rorschach from Watchmen. Moon Knight is Batman but with Split personality disorder and less badassness(which makes it even more badass when he does something cool)and Rorschach is batman if hew was poor, and had a REALLY shitty life. 




 And South park is nowhere near the animation quality of kill la kill anyway. 




 Animating costs time and money, if you don't animate things, you save money to be used animating action and fight scenes. 




 I'm in a similar boat, personally, I'll be watching FLCL,Bakenmonogatari, space dandy an Gurren Lampa. 




 I personally think that level of complexity is unlikely. As far as we're aware, individual life fibers aren't sentient, and  it would be odd to pull the 'ryuko is evil' twist again. I think that, other than some Rei backstory, all the cards are pretty much on the table now. 




 The animation does seriously decline in quality, but that's due to them saving all the budget for the last two episodes, which are one long fight sequence. For example, the eating scene in ep 22 was just static pictures to save time and money animating characters eating. 




 I don't personally watch it, mainly because I like city building games to have enemies and combat after playing DF, but that's just me. 




 Nui and ragyo are only evil, and satsuki was never chaotic or neutral  




 Fair point, but the sword not being used from the start isn't the optimum example of that, it's just a cool way to end a fight rather than something endemic of the films writing. 




 The winterkewl channel has the update videos. Because the stuff initially shown was a 'vertical slice' it's taken a while to get up to the quality seen in those demos. 




 Nui has deep psychological issues, she doesn't need the mind control. However, an interesting question is whether Rei, a completely normal person other than being completely happy to destroy the world is being mind controlled. 




 Because she's a badass, in her initial appearance she came in and blew every other character out of the water. I don't want her to win, but I'd much rather her or Rei as the final fight than Ragyo. 




 You like her, just as an antagonist you love to hate. Bear in mind most people thought that Satsuki was a villain, and hated all her fascist bullshit. We were expecting The elite four to come in, Ryuko to grow in power slowly, and eventually take down Satsuki and Ragyo. Nui came in and just didn't give a FUCK. She was a major subversion of standard shounen tropes, and incredibly pragmatic compared to Satsuki? Was I rooting for her against Ryuko? No. Was I rooting for her against Satsuki, taking on all her resolve and order with just her skills? Hell yes. 




 Hey! That's my favourite episode! 




 Parv of Crybabylon 




 Now, I don't usually get involved in shipping of any kind, but Kill la Kill has really fascinated with the potentiality for the the climax to literally go anywhere with character relationships. Similarly, reading up about KLK, it's been very interesting to see how the fanbase have incorporated plot developments into the growing speculation on what ships, if any, will happen by the end of the series. The points of contention seem to be around two fairly recent plot developments:

1. The Mako Gamagoori hinted romance/ship, I don't think a lot of people saw this coming. Usually, ships are speculation based, particularly the Yuri or unlikely ships, however, the Mako/Ryuko ship seemed increasingly likely, with frequent references (such as the nosebleed) however, after aorund episode 12, suddenly this changed, and the fanbase latched on to the Gamagoori/ Mako ship, particularly as Ryuko started to lose some audience sympathy at this point. I think it's very interesting that Mako has two potential love interests yet they're both equally 'unorthodox' (it would be a gutsy move to make the protagonist a lesbian, but also a gutsy move to deny how it thematically makes sense, as well as the shipping and fanservice angle that is played up fairly heavily on the show.)

2. The sinking of the Satsuki/Ryuko ship. Although some people still struggle along with the incest angle, It's almost certain nothing will come of this. Which leaves us with a problem: If Mako goes with Gamogoori, Ryuko really wouldn't have any love interest that she's significantly invested in, furthermore Satsuki is now almost certainly not going to have a love interest of any kind.

Therefore, I ask a question to you fellow redditors, what, from a story perspective, is most likely to happen in terms of these relationships? Will Trigger go for the gutsy move of a lesbian main character, or will they choose to pair up only Mako and maybe a few elite four/ nudist beach members? Or maybe nobody at all? I welcome the discussion. 




 Because she simply looks young, I mean, it may be presumptuous but how else can we tell the characters age? Also, don't life fibers naturally control people over 20, and although she's Ragyo's lacky, she definitely seems to be capable of independent thought. 




 Nui has been shown to be working on a project away from Ragyo's vision, looks like we've got the mother of all double crosses on our hands. 




 This has been speculated upon, but personally I doubt it, If Isshin was in disguise, he would have blown it when everybody were pulling the aces from their sleeves. Furthermore, even if he was in disguise, Ragyo must have hired a random girl, who only existed six months ago, to be her assistant, then told her all her super top secret plans, all with no prerogative. It may happen, but I think it would be bad writing if they don't give a VERY complicated explanation. 




 But why would you get a at most 18 year old girl to do that? Why would you tell her all your plans in detail, including the details of Covers? Moreover, why wouldn't you get her to be absorbed into covers when her work is done? 




 OK, So I just finished a marathon run of the Anime this weekend, and I'm super excited for the next few episodes, but I think one character is being potentially overlooked,Rei Hououmaru, Ragyo's assistant. I believe she will have some vital importance to the climax due to a few key factors.


1. She's the **very young** assistant of the main antagonist of the series, an antagonist that's shown to be extremely take no prisoners, psychopathic and condescending. The only other person in Ragyo's triad is Nui, one of the most powerful characters on the show, why would she have an assistant with no special abilities or no master plan in mind?
2. Rei is shown constantly in shots, including the titles sequence, she was also not unimportant enough to be offered to the covers, she must be kept alive for something
3. If you had a final trump card like Ragyo surely does, you wouldn't want to hide it in a secret base that could get hacked, or use it so openly in combat like with Nui, you would hide it in plain sight, slightly blurred and out of focus, just like Rei. Therefore, I posit a theory: The new outfit being made by Nui isn't for Ryuko or Ragyo, it's for Rei, the person under her absolute control and power, kept following around on a leash. I predict Rei will do something in the climax that openly makes us go WHAT THE FUCK? Like so many of the twists so far.


Anyway, I'm open for discussion and contradiction, so fire away! 




 I like to think that Duncan acquired those resources through a daring, oceans 11 style heist. 




 Wait a second, luck is useless in combat, it's essentially a junk skill. What a crappy thing to sell. 




 Really? Will it turn me into a snake? 




 Wait, where was the ARG about 'eyebrow guy?' That sounds hilarious. 




 OK, I believe this was a fuck-up. A HUGE fuck-up, but a fuck-up none the less. 




 But that just dug you a bigger hole. If people were criticizing you for deleting posts, why did you ever think deleting those posts would help? 




 So the post that was deleted minutes ago, which was simply a twitter post by Rythian, was deleted by bots for the words 'oh snap'? 




 This isn't absolute power, this is enough power to delete comments you don't like without any discussion or debate, this is just enough power to make it you're always looking after the public interest. 




 Give a couple assholes the ability to whitewash their problems away and this tends to happen. I remember a similar situation killing the mighty no9 forums. 




 Coming soon: Minecraft: the subreddit chronicle. 




 Please for the next indie game play Abobo's big adventure! It has actual creative talent put into it! 




 Nope, even if you actively try to make it less complex, it will still have things like military upkeep, inventorary management, hospitals, minecarts, dwarven personalities, tantrum spirals and vampires to contend with. 




 I've suggested this in the game suggestion thread, If he's already played Earthbound I really want him to play mother 3. It would be amazing to see a game that actually makes sips cry. 




 You know what would be really Meta to play?South part:TSOT. Think about how much roleplay we would be doing! 




 Nobody expects the Spanish sjinquisition! 




 mmm, I do think that's a problem, although there are now mods that let you use Towns style sprites for DF. I just think the RP potential is too good to ignore. 




 Hey sips, this may be COMPLETELY out of leftfield, but how about Earthbound? It's generally seen as one of the best JRPG'S ever made, is all about American values, is nostalgic because it was around in your childhood, and is quietly weird without being in your face like South park. (Although Earthbound was inspiration for the new South park game) If you've already played Earthbound, I'll suggest something even MORE radical [Mother 3](http://mother3.fobby.net/), the sequel to Earthbound, which was made in 2006, and, thanks to the glories of fan translation, can now be played in the west. Mother 3 is generally regarded as a narrative masterpiece, humourous yet incredibly touching. (many people have said it made them cry) I know it's a big undertaking, but I gaurantee you'll be hooked by the end of the first chapter of Mother 3 




 IMO rather than do Towns he should just bite the bullet of town development games and try dwarf fortress, It's more complex than towns will ever be
 




 Ok, So i just put this up on the actual subreddit (derp) but [Abobo's big adventure](http://abobosbigadventure.com/) would be the perfect game for sips, It's all about the big bastard from double dragon himself,is super fun and has loads of awesome references and easter eggs! 




 Can't believe this has never been suggested before, but the boss that sips was excited about in Double Dragon neon, Abobo, has had his very own videogame for a couple years now! I don't want to spoil to much, but it's the PERFECT game for sips, and in general is a send-up to the NES games of his childhood. The game can be found [here] (http://abobosbigadventure.com/) 




 Anyone else think that Lewis's voice was exactly like Ed Millibands in this video? 




 The yogscast: Masters of minecraft. 




 There's literally no point to metagaming in a choose your own adventure like this. I've played it, and there aren't any instant lose conditions, you just travel the journey you want, whilst stopping off to get the keywords on the way. 




 But you redo the entire game whenever you reach the gate without the keywords. 




 They don't really get how this works do they?  It's like a kid going:
"I can make much betterer videoes than pewdiepie, he got 10 million subs in a few years, I'll get like ten bajillion in a few seconds with my 360 no-scopes!" 




 I like to think of it like this, if helix is God, and the Dome is the devil, Zapdos is Cthulhu, a being TPP was not meant to have, that is slowly driving us to madness, anarchy isn't working, democracy isn't working. All fall under the mighty zapdos.  




 I'm not sure he'll be able to survive this massacre much longer. The keeper  needs to be put back in the box, only then will the madness end. 




 WHEN WILL THE MADNESS END? YOU DAMN MANIACS!WHEN WILL YOU LEARN? 




 Bigdig digged to heaven :c 




 Nah I'm sure... OH GOD, OH GOD BIGDIG NO!!!!!! 




 So this is how Bird Jesus ends, with thunderous applause.... 




 You thought Zapdos being caught and saved from release was a good thing? You thought the helix, in all his power and wisdom, would directly intervene to save the supposed '2nd coming'? Face it, if Flareon was the heretic, Zapdos is the antichrist. He killed Dux, he Killed the seed, he isn't even a follower of Democracy,he is bigger; a bigger force of evil at play than even the Dome. 




 There's only one word that accurately describes my feelings right now:

lol 
























 Sorry, It's just that joker fish plot was recycled from the 70's/80's comics. 




 Yeah, this batman story from the 70's showcases how harmless the joker is! How about the time he cut off his own face, then killed 100's of people to try to get to batman, then tortured alfred and convinced the bat family that he cut off their face? What a jolly jape that was! 




 I have never seen magical girl series before madoka, hell, the only other anime I watched at the time was kill la kill and AOT. However, I would say to truly enjoy it you have to already be into narrative structure and storytelling, rather than just watching things for action sequences. I would also say it's not really an anime to recommend to kids or dumb people.  




 So robocop: the series? 




 It's a 50/50 thing everywhere. Even critics either gave 5 stars on 2 stars. 




 Kill la kill was also my first anime (other than claymore for some reason) and I found it to be massively flawed and overhyped, especially compared to Madoka magica. 




 If you're looking for stuff this season,  also look at akuma no riddle. Similar Yuri action to kill la kill. 




 I think the majority of people just use the washing machine/line to dry clothes. Space is at too much of a premium in Britain to have separate tumble dryers. 




 Man, What a poser, doesn't even use Ketchup lube on his bacon wank. 




 Fuck me, I forgot all about that, sorry, haven't been using the ol' ham radio for a while. However, I am deeply skeptical about that Napoleon stuff, Napoleon grew up in Australia, and  Australia was sunk by the whore of Nazareth 22 years ago. Therefore, Napoleon cannot know about the bullshit, as Austalia still hasn't invented Democracy.  




 Not really, Big breakout stuff is seen by Americans, like Shaun of the dead, but the majority of the great british films regularly released  (and by that I mean once every 3 months) are small products that wouldn't interest Yanks or regular british people anyway. 




 Brit here, never heard of a washing machine OUTSIDE a kitchen. 




 TBH I also believe that the moon landings took place on mars, but the Surface was painted to look black and white with Martian Bullshit, the most supple,nutritious  and effective of all the shit. 




 Edgar Wright-Shaun of the dead, although his arguable first directing Gig was the TV show spaced, which showed tremendous film making talent as well. 




 Probably professional assassin. She's essentially the most powerful being on Earth now. Can she even age? 




 Not necessarily a purely Mikasa focused series, but a more ensemble focused series. When Erin becomes a titan other cast members can't really act effectively, whereas 3DMG people can move between and help each other out. 




 This.  Erin having superpowers massively undermines Mikasa's character development in that episode, and she could have become a really decent protagonist. However, Erins superpowers make the show all about a flat, static character who the audience just isn't interested in 




 I view as more of a Faustian tragedy than a deconstruction.  




 I, Unlike most people, think the ending didn't really tie up all the loose ends, such as Rei and stuff. I think an elite 4 spin-off would be a really fun watch. 




 The Madoka OP is perfect for the underlying show: It's a saccharine glitzy pink opener, but the more you watch it (pre episode 10) the  more you start to see that it's actually depressing. My favourite detail is the montage of Madoka's comic hijinks, whist in the bottom left Chibi!Madoka gets more and more depressed, with Kyubey abandoning her in the end. It perfectly demonstrates how much grief being the comic relief would cause you. 




 Don't sweat it, I already did a much larger comment reply or r/anime:


I started watching it pretty much immediately after Kill la kill, and it doesn't hold up well in a character department. The characters in Kill la kill (and Madoka magica, which I watched after getting bored of AOT) are magnetic, genuinely entertaining characters, whereas I only really cared about Misaka in AOT, because she's way more interesting than the protagonist. I also found the battle of Trost to be ridiculously overdrawn, full of filler, and poorly paced within it's own arc and the general series (Erin fights, and nearly defeats, the colossal Titan in the first episode of the arc with barely any fanfare, the political intrigue, and royal guard/expedition force stuff should have been well before the battle of Trost)
I also feel that AOT is really unable to provoke 'the feels' in me, because I've seen the 'Mother dies in front of protagonist's eyes' trope so many times in comicbooks, as well as Mikasa's backstory and charactrer being similar to Claymore backstories. (the only other anime I ever watched) I also really didn't feel threatened by the Titans, as the 3D manouvre gear made every character spider man (Very little is shown to make it seem like the gear is ineffective other than dialogue, such as an apparent 1/5th of forces dying during a simple distraction detail)


I don't however, think it's terrible, and it is a good show. I'm just baffled why it's the show everyone tries to convince non-anime people like me to see, when Madoka magica is IMO a masterpiece. 




 Whilst I value your sense of social justice,the term Ladyboy is used to refer to a subculture, and, as far as I'm aware, isn't campaigned against by members of that subculture. 




 Watching AOT now, and I have to say, compared to my other two most recently watched animes, kill la kill and Madoka magica, it's quite hideously overrated IMO. 




 I don't know, the thing is, we have NO context for that shot, both in-universe and outside it. It could be one animator who decided to add it, it could have been the majority consensus to put it in. It is also a fairly blatant bit of fanservice/pandering and in my opinion, was a massive mistake. 




 I was mainly talking about how the Makogoori ship essentially implies that the entire series was about Gamagoori working up the courage to ask Mako out. I think the main reason people think Makogoori 'won' is that after the episode premiered, that ship was **dead** without that ONE PANEL in the credits (which I would also points out, means that we never get to find out what the E4 did after the events of the show) Ryumako would pretty much undoubtedly be canon (other arguments would be called heteronormativity to a much greater extent than the current norm) so when people found that image, many on the second viewing, Makogoori 'rose from the ashes.' People started making comics, and the rest is history. 




 I just find it weird how there's so much fanart of Mako/gamagoori that necessitates Mako acting out of character to work properly. The only character that Mako has had any interest in ever has been Ryuko, who is, contrary to popular belief, the main character of the story. I don't think Makogoori is unwarranted, but it is far from canon.   




 The dismal Jesters, Imagine a more adult version of the yogpod. 




 Ryumako, because apparently it's TOTALLY NOT CANON GAMAMAKO FOREVER GUYZ\???!!!! 




 So one of my favorite movies of all time is Scott pilgrim vs The world, I personally think it was another Directorial masterpiece from Edgar Wright. It was also highly critically acclaimed. However, whenever I ask anyone about it in my School,be it jocks, nerds, whoever, they all unanimously hate it. (and, surprisingly, have seen it) So I ask of you, what film do you, and the general fanbase love but everyone you ask about it seem to hate? 




 I think AOT is actually more disconcerting than Madoka magica, at least for me, as Madoka magica is a deconstruction of the surrealism associated with the Anime Genre, whereas AOT relishes that same Anime Surrealism. Madoka magica is also  better written, at least from my perspective

However, my perspective may well be unusual, as I was already a massive hipster/nerd, with a full knowledge of tv tropes. I would also like to say that from a perspective of ignorance, AOT is definitely a more appealing show to males. 




 I started watching it pretty much immediately after Kill la kill, and it doesn't hold up well in a character department. The characters in Kill la kill (and Madoka magica, which I watched after getting bored of AOT) are *magnetic,* genuinely entertaining characters, whereas I only really cared about Misaka in AOT, because she's way more interesting than the protagonist. I also found the battle of Trost to be ridiculously overdrawn, full of filler, and poorly paced within it's own arc and the general series (Erin fights, and nearly defeats, the colossal Titan in the first episode of the arc with barely any fanfare, the political intrigue, and royal guard/expedition force stuff should have been well before the battle of Trost)

 The first 3 episodes of attack on titan are probably the best of the first half of the season. After that it's essentially one massive drawn out battle. 




 Don't forget Makogoori shipping that necessitates Mako acting out of character!  




 But it's also mentioned that the escalation of Kaiju threat made nukes massively inefficient, hence the creation of the jeagers. I can see why you didn't like the movie, but that's really not a plot hole.  




 It explains in the movie that they tried to Nuke the rift but it didn't work, hence why the main plot of the movie is to Nuke the rift from the inside. 




 There still doing videos of the alpha on winterkewls page. 




 For the first few seconds I actually thought this was another look at yogventures. 




 Ragyo being an evil rita repulsa style character is one of the reasons I find Nui, Satsuki and arguably Rei, to be better antagonists. Those characters felt like they had actual intentions motivations and personalities other than being over the top evil. 




 Nah, episode 9's already fucking broken me, and I mean, legitimately broken me, I've been depressed for days. 




 In the 90's, but now he's been thoroughly replaced by Deadpool/Iron man, which is why it baffles me Fox is yet to make a deadpool movie. Tv tropes actually has a page about it [here] (http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity) 




 The thing with Scott pilgrims ending is that the ending to the comic hadn't been written yet, and a lot of the context to the comics ending comes from the 5th and 6th books, which were not available during the movies production stages. The ending to the film was also meant to have scott end up with Knives instead, but it didn't test well. 




 Yeah, that sort of thing, as I've mentioned in previous threads as well, Inamuta has no real compulsion to be Satsuki's lackey other than power, and now that's gone, I thought you could add some cool character conflicts.  




 Just wondering, because people are building up the competition between it and black bullet. 




 essentially, if there was a season 2, I would personally like it to be more character based, as there's a **lot** of potential for personal conflicts after the series end, but that's just me. 




 I don't think a S2/sequel movie is that difficult to write for, particularly with the large number of loose ends left by the end of S1. I'm not saying it's a definite, but unless the OVA is extremely dense with material, you could potentially really easily find interesting angles for more content. That said, Senketsu is definitely dead. 




 Why not Akuma no riddle? That's in this season and has themes from kill la kill doesn't it? 




 It would be really cool for her to turn up like this in season 2, and completely in character. Nui could just turn up as a school girl, acting innocent, and Ryuko would be essentially powerless to act, would provide great drama. 




 I started watching attack on titan and finishing some promotional ideas for my own webcomic. However, AOT left me frustrated (It doesn't have the same emotional resonance for me as for others, I get no feels, I also don't like Eren as a character) so I started watching Madoka, and I think it's an astonishingly good series. 




 Holy shit! I just finished watching Madoka magica today (but not rebellion, no spoilers) it was a freakin' masterpiece! 




 Satsuki is genuinely a fascist, and is planning to take over the world, aware that with the life fibres gone, nudist beach is the only military left. 




 Pretty much, way more overpowered than superman. Wonder woman is also a better fighter than superman, and has a whip that compels people to tell the truth. Green lantern is also arguably more powerful, as he can construct any of his minds desires, and can ask for help from the green lantern corps, GL also knocked out **batman** in one punch. Batman has also been shown to consistently kick supermans ass. 




 Actually, In the Justice league comics, Superman is genuinely one of the weakest links on the team, any supervillain who outstrips superman in strength (and they all do, even lex luthor in his battle armor) will knock superman around for most of the fight. A MUCH bigger problem for the movies is the flash, who is ridiculously overpowered in a team setting. 




 Wasn't it THEN explained that it DEFINITELY WASN'T a doombot? Like, specifically by the editors? 




 TBH she doesn't break the marvel universe as much as people think, because the sentry is essentially squirrel girl played straight. You really could just explain away her powers as her being a reincarnation of the sentry/phoenix force.  




 I would totally watch a great lake avengers movie. 




 So Duncan, who the majority of people think did significantly better than zoey and Hannah, will get -14 points? seems a little harsh. 




 To be fair, if you want to be *really* specific the latest series revealed that he doesn't have Schizophrenia or split personalities, and his mind is actually trying to reconcile the interpretations of an alien consciousness, which mankind has viewed as the Ancient Egyptian God, Khonshu

**Comics are weird** 




 He has a new series out now, so it's a great jumping on point. 




 Makes me really want a moon knight movie. Moon Knight is essentially a combination of Rorscach and batman with added schizophrenia, plus, he exists in the marvel universe, so he once imagined Spider-man, wolverine and captain America were his split personalities. 




 All anime is also based of western culture after WW2, so technically this is a American take on the japanese take on the american take on the japanese take on Sci FI and martial arts. 




 KLK is set in a dystopia, but it's never explored, which would be an interesting direction for season 2. 




 Copied from my comment on a previous thread:

Season 2 would focus around a spec ops's style team, composed of Satsuki, Tsumugu, Uzu, Inamuta and nonon, trying to dismantle Revocs, which is now under the control of Rei, who is attempting to bring about the return of the live fibres (Sorry to Gamagoori fans, but if he was in the series people would focus way too heavily on his character, and, due to the season finale, we know there's no danger to him, also, the season would become about Mako/gamagoori shipping again) Ryuko and Mako don't appear, leaving their lives ambiguous. The show would be scaled down from kill la kill, having more grounded action and more characterization, as the life fibers have been destroyed, (comic relief is kept up by bickering, as is the hectic animation) therefore, the series focuses on Tsumugu and Satsuki making elaborate, batman esque plans, and having them usually horribly fail due to bickering and infighting, however, there are clear character arcs and motivations that the characters can undergo, further expanding and elaborating on the core series:


*Satsuki has to reconcile her current life as the 'good guy' with the fact that she was essentially a fascist dictator, and killed innocent people to create a gambit that didn't work


*Tsumugu finds out more about his sister, his reasons for joining nudist beach, and his relationship with his allies, who he has been trained to hate.


*Inamuta becomes generally more developed, taking a more active role in the narrative. He also has the most neutral backstory, since he never really swore the loyalty the other had for Satsuki. He may turn heel.


*Nonon has to deal with her spoiled, rich girl attitude in relation to the others selflessness, she also potentially has feeling for another team member


*Uzu has to deal with his self inflicted social isolation from the other team members, as well as essentially being 
the dumb muscle. Can possibly have a quest for a rematch against Ryuko.


*In general, the series could do lots of world building, particularly around what cause the world of Kill la Kill to get as screwed up as it is. Furthermore, halfway through the series, Nui turns up alive, meaning the team has to deal with who would essentially be the most powerful being on the planet as regular humans. Alternatively, Nui turns face, meaning the rest of the team has to deal with their suspicion of her.
I genuinely think a series all about badass normal pragmatism would be really cool, but maybe that's just me. 




 The demoman grenade launcher has 6 barrels because they originally intended for it to fir 6 shots per clip, a better example would be the soldier not having a finished reload animation for most rocket launchers, and just slapping the barrel instead. 




 Dwarf fortress. It's the most complex city builder an you know it. It was also popular in the other threads. 




 Welcome to the world of unexplained plot threads left hanging for a possible next season! 




 See Ryumako shippers! It's totally, indisputably  canon now, as is Guts/Mako's mom 




 Didn't Lewis win the livestream games because Duncan made the same spaceship part twice by accident? 




 UZU/RYUKO SHIP MILDLY VALIDATED! 




 My favorite episode. (or at least my most fondly remembered) Contrary to popular opinion, I think this episode does the most to establish the world of Kill la kill, a brutal, oppressive and violent social class system. It's almost a shame that the show later on removed most of the fascist, apocalyptic stuff in favor of straighter Good vs evil fights. 




 Man, I feel weird having found the second game pretty easy. Oh well. 




 But then it would just be bayonetta 3, and KLK doesn't really have many large enemies. I just think it would work better with handdrawn sprites, which 2D fighters allow. 




 There are more developed elite 4 backstories in the manga. 




 The only way KLK could work as a game is Persona 4 arena/ Jrpg style, however, I've had a fairly good Idea for season 2:

Season 2 would focus around a spec ops's style team, composed of Satsuki, Tsumugu, Uzu, Inamuta and nonon, trying to dismantle Revocs, which is now under the control of Rei, who is attempting to bring about the return of the live fibres (Sorry to Gamagoori fans, but if he was in the series people would focus way too heavily on his character, and, due to the season finale, we know there's no danger to him, also, the season would become about Mako/gamagoori shipping **again**) Ryuko and Mako don't appear, leaving their lives ambiguous. The show would be scaled down from kill la kill, having more grounded action and more characterization, as the life fibers have been destroyed, (comic relief is kept up by bickering, as is the hectic animation) therefore, the series focuses on Tsumugu and Satsuki making elaborate, batman esque plans, and having them usually horribly fail due to bickering and infighting, however, there are clear character arcs and motivations that the characters can undergo, further expanding and elaborating on the core series:

 Dwarf fortress Sips

PLS YES 




 Exactly, I thought the last couple of episodes as a whole focused way too much on giving the fans what they want rather than a satisfying narrative conclusion.  




 Exactly. Satsuki is really out of focus in the finale/discussion, because the shipping takes over the show. 




 Whilst I don't think of it as a 'huge milestone.' I do think it make the most sense within the context of the story. But because of that one Gamagoori still, everyone what would have been a sweet ending into a flame/shipping war. They could have just had a nice 'believe what you want to believe' ending,but now we have this petty shipping spat completely throwing the focus off Satsuki and Ryuko. 




 I Kind of think the OVA will put Rei in the spotlight. She will either be the 'bonus boss' or there'll be a season 2. She's too much of a loose end. 




 This was a weird direction for Shadow of Israphel episode #43 to go. 




 People saying there's nothing there really is just plain ignorance, there really is NOTHING disproving the RYUMAKO relationship. 




 I've never read, or have been interested in Kotaku, however, after hearing people talk about how bad it is on my beloved DTOID, I thought it was hyperbole, surely no website can be as bad as they say kotaku is? However, this is one of the most poorly researched, slanderous pieces of 'news' I've ever read. Tabloid level journalism, and blatantly ignores the fact that Ryuko sticks a syringe in her arm, meaning, even IF this article had any kind of point to make, it would be based on a false assumption. 




 Here's a slightly easier to understand version of the story: (http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AdrielWallick/20140331/214258/Lets_talk_about_accountability.php) 




 Essentially it was a simple polaris 'event' that became hideously overproduced when sponsors such as mountain Dew, and one particular asshole called Matti, got involved, it was basically a horrible experience for a multitude of people, and a huge waste of money for maker studios. 




 Maker studios created it's biggest event ever, costing over $400000, featuring all of it's major stars and big devs from the indie scene, however, due to the ignorance of marketing execs, and general bureaucracy, ot ended in dismal, unsalvageable failure, and is a testament to the perils of overproducing simple youtube concepts 









 Y'know, I always wondered why the mods don't do more stuff on the subreddit's they create.






Now I know. 




 Doesn't really make that much sense, they're both obviously just title sequences, which don't follow narrative requirements like points of view. OP 2 also logically can't be from Satsuki's POV, as she wasn't a good guy when it started airing. 




 Yeah, but the flaming has gotten pretty bad now, particularly as the Ryumako camp feels pushed into a corner, I think it was a bad decision to leave it this ambiguous. 




 Guardians of the galaxy says hello. 




 Said Yween, behind a wall holding flowers. 




 Nui is, in my opinion, the best character to come out of kill la kill. That kind of "I don't give a shit" dynamism and pragmatism are some of my general favorite character traits.  




 But I'm not in the ryumako camp (I assume calling it makogoori was a mistake) I'm just viewing it objectively, yes, Mako uses hyperbole and analogy, but if the imagery is of a romantic date whilst describing a date, I think she's talking about a romantic date. For example, when people talk about the xenomorth bit in ep 17, when  she uses that imagery we assume she's talking about an actual alien from the context and imagery, rather than assuming she's talking about an illegal alien. I would also point her trying to psyche Ryuko up implies even more she was talking about a romantic date. However, I also concede that the ending is till to ambiguous to judge until the OVA.  




 I really wish the ending was less ambiguous on this stuff, the speculation is ruining the community. 




 But in the context of that scene, it was clearly a spontaneous thing, and  it obviously didn't feature Satsuki in the description. Plus, if you use visual description, mako showed the date with romantic connotations, whilst I'm not invalidating Gamako, I genuinely think the ED didn't show the date In question. 




 Mako being all over Ryuko's body is Yuri, whether played for laughs or not. The ending has essentially separated the fanbase into have's and have not's, and, because neither side has conclusive proof, and neither side has conclusive rebuttal, people are resorting to stupid slurs. 




 Yeah, It was spoiled for me before I wrote the thread, I've been sarcastic. Basically I start with dark anime on Mondays, and then it gets lighter from there. 




 Since the academy is underwater, and the characters seem to have been re-adjusted (satsuki getting a haircut etc.) I think it's not the pivotal 'date' Ryuko keeps talking about in the climax. 




 Thanks brah! I'm totally hyped for watching episode 3! It sounds great! 




 Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?????? I thought it was super happy fun times with the magical girls? 




 Why would Ragyo care what gender something is? She only cares about helping life fibres spread in the universe. 




 I've been given you counter arguments this entire time! Let me summarize:


Having smaller Breasts means nothing, she has breasts, full stop, she's even shown nude in one scene which was explicitly not in Ryuko's head, it's about as relavent as saying nono or Rei is a boy, it's ludicrous.

The boy disguise is just that, a disguise, a major piece of foreshadowing in that episode was her appearing in a female bathroom.

Ragyo has shown no indication that she needed a boy, and also no indication that she personally sees nui as a daughter, and Nui was conceived out of life fibres.

Basically, none of that 'evidence' holds any water. Give up. 




 The evidence isn't there, nothing you've presented is evidence, at all. It's all subjective. 




 Episode 13, NUI, whilst still disguised as a boy, appears in a female bathroom cubicle, foreshadowing the disguise. Why does Ragyo want her to be a girl? Ragyo doesn't even see her as a daughter 




 A rocksteady Moon Knight game. 
























 Weren't there mutterings that this was an amazing script that got eaten alive by notes? I'm glad they salvaged something. 




 The closest videogame to a holodeck is, in my opinion, dwarf fortress. Shame it doesn't get much press. 




 Because the cities neighbor, Bludhaven, is even more shit. 




 He may not have had financial success, but Firefly, buffy and Angel were extremely good shows, and Serenity was a really great movie, with lots of nice directorial flourishes. It way outweighed stuff like Zathura, or even the first Iron man in terms of quality. I'm sure the new director will do a good job, but it won't be Edgar Wright quality. 




 But Joss whedon had already directed some really good stuff, in particular Firefly/serenity, moreover, John Favreau was never really as good of a director as Wright, who is probably one of the greatest mainstream directors to emerge in the last 20 years of cinema. 




 What might eventually happen is that it gets adapted into an anime TV series, seeing as the company that made the sequence are essentially the golden child of Japanese animation now, and the anime sequence was one of, if not the, best part. 




 Further confusing this is that Joss whedon apparently sent James Gunn's original script for GOTG back for 'not being James Gunn enough' 




 She-hulk being Bruce Banners cousin is basic comic book shit. Martian manhunter being hugely relevant to both the Justice League in the comics and in the animation is basic shit.  




 Kevin Feige actually knew barely anything about comics when he started as an exec, but he **learned** unlike Goyer. 




 This film will be weird. It's based on a spin-off of a spin-off of the x men, for crying out loud. 




 Don't worry buddy, I understood that reference. 




 Basically, the x men comics have a massive cast of loved characters and villains, around as many as the rest of the marvel universe alone. Rather than build up these individual characters, Ratner chose to include as many as he possibly could and ruin them all. For example, the Juggernaut is an entirely different character in the comics, and his appearance is equivalent to The hulk turning up in the avengers as a guy who can just turn green when he wants to. 




 I can almost guarantee that old man logan is the only she hulk story goyer has read, seeing as the only three writers that Hollywood respects are Moore, Miller and Millar. 




 I like how he apparently didn't realize she-hulk is meant to be the Hulk's  *cousin* 




 He also wrote a nick fury movie.... starring David Hasselhoff. 




 It's not even that goofy. The martian manhunter is actually a pretty badass title, and basically describes his job. 'Batman' sounds way more inherently goofy, but becomes not goofy due to *context,* which Goyer apparently doesn't understand. 




 Actually, all of the other people who filled the role of batgirl were more popular than Barbara, as Barbara never actually got her own comic as batgirl until 2011. (barbara is more well known as Oracle, although you might be referring to other media?) Cssandra cain in particular is a great fit for the arkhamverse, having a over 100 issue comic run, being a better fighter than batman, and being an intriguing character in her own right. 




 It really could be anyone, as there are so many characters/alliances/guilds that could facilitate such a character. Hell, for all we know it could be Cassandra or david cain. 




 A villain who fills the same niche as tonnes of other batman villains, hence the speculation it's Jason todd, heretic etc. 




 Justice

Yeah, it must be real difficult to decide a profession based on that name.

 Hey, is there a German dub of attack on titan? because isn't that the language the characters are heavily implied to speak in-universe? 




 This. I'm more than happy to read subs (although I read faster than normal, so don't have many issues) but sometimes dubs just fit the tone and theme of the series better, black lagoon being the most prominent. 




 I agree for the most part, but I really think the 'winter soldier' theme was nailed, those air raid siren really add menace to the character. 




 I'm sure the youtube community will just LOVE the ending. 




 Lewis voted for another player to win other than his arch nemesis, I don't get why people think that's being butt hurt rather than competitive. Duncan lost the game by not building for science, and, as is meant to be the flow of the game, other Civs ganged up and defeated him by voting for a neutral player. 




 You do realize that a diplomatic victory is a completely legitimate victory condition right? It could have happened anyway without Lewis's intervention if Rythian had actually worked for it, and Duncan should have been working to complete his science victory rather than investing in giant robots. Duncan lost the game, and Rythian won. Simple as. 




 MALMO REMEMBERS BITCHES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 




 Black lagoon needs a dub to be watched properly, especially as everyone canonically speaks English in the series. 




 Sayaka from Madoka magica is best girl. Her best girl stat transcends time. 









 Hollywood: " Oh, we've learnt our lesson, we've hired a promising sci-fi writer by the name of Roberto Orci to direct the new big budget star trek!" 




 Oh, I'm by no means doubting that, however, I am curious what website you work for that still has a community that proclaims such blatantly false accusations, as women have been involved in the game blogging/reviewing industry since it's inception. 




 Lewis looks around his fallen empire, a single tear shedding from his eye. He looks at the Sky, his face contorted in rage, only able to utter a single, fearsome word:

"PYRION!"


"PYRION!"

and finally, inexorably, a final throe: "PYRIIIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNN!" 




 Actually, people thought Jim was trolling when he said dynasty warriors 8 for PC was unplayable. People do not trust Jim sterling. Period. 




 Spain says "SURPRISE MOTHERFUCKAS!!!!" 




 I'm pretty sure that skyfall, at least at one point, was meant to confirm that theory. I remember watching it in cinemas and thinking that Silva would be an ex James Bond, and it would be a big 50th anniversary twist. It was a real shame when the entire 3rd act went out of its way to disprove the theory though. 




 The book wasn't finished by the time the movie was being made, but Bryan Lee o malley had a lot of say in the original content. 




 I would recommend Lego marvel superheroes on that front, despite not having particularly great controls for flying, the amount of speed you can get whilst playing as say, Iron man is pretty incredible. 




 So I thought it would be interesting to see what peoples choices were for comicbooks when you take watchmen/v for vendetta/ batman out of the picture. 




 My mistake. I sincerely apologize. 




 Which of the three madoka universes though? 




 I find that hugely annoying in anime, it makes the singles really hard to buy legitimately. 




 It's no fun is it? 




 If you read the book, you'll find out exactly why Wiseau is the last person you ever want on your film set. Remember, the room is made with the *best takes* 




 I don't think safety will be the problem, It's the illusion of safety, the idea that you won't be able to swerve to avoid cars etc. That will stop people from buying, particularly as cars without hugely expensive computers running them will be cheaper. 




 The problem is, in self driving cars there's no element of agency. I just don't see why you would spend thousands of dollars to buy a vehicle you can't really control. 




 It's a niche product at best, yet everyone has to buy it for it to work properly. If you want to be in a car that you have absolutely zero control over, why not just take the train? 




 Actually, self driving cars have been in concept stages since the 70's. They're relatively easy to do, just have the car follow a signal along the road. The main reason they haven't been introduced yet is due to people wanted to be able to control their multi-thousand dollar 2 tonne death machine. 




 Ant man is too close to coming out. Edgar usually puts around 4 years into production of his movies, and I doubt he's familiar with power rangers. 




 I did. Without mods. Losing/failing is fun! 




 It's worth noting that Godzilla fights a monster in every movie since Godzilla vs King kong, so it's a staple of the genre, rather than a real plot twist. 




 Not recently. Scotland is looking increasingly pro-independence, and, as a liberal, I can't really be against them wanting to get the fuck away from the Tories. 




 Asexuality is **very** complicated. And barely covered in the media. 




 Try out 'all star superman,' hell, any frame of reference past the Richard Donner films shows that he's not a 'boyscout.' Clark Kent is superman, not the other way around, he's a regular guy that tries to remain as humble as possible when facing impossible odds, something the Snyder film missed. 




 Apparently, neither the writer nor director has seen NGE, and the movie was inspired more by 70/80's anime, but take that with a grain of salt. 




 In my personal opinion it just felt more like it kept getting beaten, but then escaping on technicalities or Dues ex machina. First the corps capture it, then it uses a unseen previously ability to escape in human form, and you expect their to be a actual human v human fight or chase, mixing up the action, but that doesn't appear. Then Erens team essentially defeat it again, only for it to use more superpowers to kill a team of highly trained professionals. (who all decide to run into it) Then it beats Eren in a fight, which takes forever (altrhough it did legitimately win that time), and then Levi defeats it AGAIN but it's still pointless and we're still, apparently meant to think it 'won' when it got it's ass kicked for the last few episodes. The last arc is much better IMO because the stakes are actually grounded, we know what the female titan can do, and it doesn't pull any powers out of it's ass. 




 Sorry about the spoiler thing, I couldn't get the spoiler tag to work so just left it vague. I honestly felt like it didn't remain compelling after the first capture, she's still running around in titan form, which we have seen be caught, and then it's just watching her *almost* get caught again and again. It's not moving the plot forward, it's just watching people fail for fairly contrived reasons. (particularly once Levi comes in) I actually really liked the arc after it, where it actually feels like an even fight, but for half the recon corps arc, I was personally bored. 




 A year or two ago I had a nostalgia binge, watching youtube video etc.  I remember that roaming robots (the company doing the live shows) bought the rights to the robot wars name, and, if I remember correctly, they were pitching it to companies. (although it obviously wasn't successful) It's probably up to the producers more than anything, as neither the BBC or Channel 5 treated it with any respect. I think it's pretty much a matter of time before someone organizes a twitter campaign or whatever. It was a stalwart of a LOT of peoples childhoods, and when they become celebrities.... 




 What? Was that meant to be a sentence? 




 I hated how protracted that sequence was. Once the female titan gets trapped the first time, she loses all threat and mystery. After that it's just waiting for the inevitable to happen. 




 I hope the next movie focuses on sayaka, it would be really neat to explore her character after the changes in rebellion. 




 Yeah, they're really trying to get the rights to a TV show back. I think in today's climate, an optimistic, no bullshit *engineering* competition would be insanely cool. Think about all the new technology can be used to smash stuff! 




 I have the feeling in time started as a good script, but focus groups and producers sucked all the life out of it. 




 Bit of an unusual choice, but try out the three madoka magica movies. They're very japanese, but probably the darkest 12A movies aside from grave of the fireflies. They're actually some of my favorite films of all time, and well worth a watch even if you don't cry. 




 wow, went to robot wars when I was 5 as well! You know they still have robot tournaments across the country? 




 I would say the rock actually has very weak pulling power, roughly the same as vin diesel. People enjoy seeing him in a movie, but they won't go to a movie just for him. 




 It might be the spirit level terrible. Frank Miller pulling a good script out of the bag would be a pretty major fluke. And machete kills/spy kids 4 were massively critically panned. 




 I'm really backing GOTG to do well. Seems a much better idea for a summer family film than TMNT 




 Sin city, from the directors of Spy kids 4 and The spirit! It will certainly be interesting to see whether both Frank miller and Robert Rodriguez can actually turn their careers around. 




 That's an interesting point. Gaurdians of the galaxy has a draw far superior to TMNT, but aims at the same audience in multiple ways. It will also be the superior sci-fi film. (barring a disaster) Given the option of seeing TMNT or guardians of the galaxy, GOTG will win 99 times out of 100. 




 In the UK, pretty much everyone is a Sherlock fan, so it certainly sold well over here. The hobbit is also a damn well made movie, and almost certainly has more care put into than TMNT. 




 You don't seem to be able to understand that the new Godzilla movie has all the trappings of being a good movie, whereas the nearly 15 year old Roland Emmerich  movie had all the trappings of being shit. Are you really saying that the trailers/clips for the new Godzilla movie look like a 'bullshit monster movie with a shit story?' 




 Sci-fi/fantasy films need to be **good** (or at least not unbearably tedious)to really make traction in the box office, particularly if they're a new IP. Hercules seems to be aiming solely for a 3-star/2 star range, and, like prince of persia, it will fail. 




 It has a lot to do with how complex the swinging mechanics are, both from a coding and conceptual perspective. Things like momentum and building physics take a more concerted effort to recreate than almost everything else in the game. There's also the fact that Treyarch are just better devs than Beenox, of course they'll make a better game in the time than Beenox churning it out in time for the movie release.


There are lot's of old, great game mechanics that have been lost due to the industry cutting corners. Goldeneye and half life had a tonne of mechanics (such as shootable NPC's) that industry is too scared to use, because it might ruin their carefully crafted narratives. 




 It has a lot of interesting touches when you consider that, in-universe, the book would essentially become one of the most important books of all time, and it essentially is about the most famous celebrities of that era it would be the real world equivalent of a guy going round talking to The president, Steven Spielberg, and David Beckham, only as badass war heroes. 




 The POV character for that segment could easily be a film lead. It's subtle, but on re-reading I noticed that the character was involved in every major campaign of the zombie war, and was the only person to go from yonkers to the final battle. Max brooks was essentially interviewing (in universe) America's greatest war hero, but didn't introduce him as such because he assumed you would have already known about him. That's a pretty great idea for a film, in my opinion. 




 Yeah, that was meant to be a satellite that released the monster from hibernation, rather than the monster itself. 




 Monsters, director Gareth evens first foray into the genre, and if your willing to delve deeper into Japanese animation you have at minimum the series attack on Titan and neon genesis evangelion, as well as the upcoming (summer) Aldonoah. zero which promises to breathe even more life into the genre. 




 The movie is kind of lame in general if you're a sci-fi guy. IMO  it would be a much better film if it wasn't so embarrassed to embrace the tropes it rips off. Even though it's still a great film, it's redundant in the face of better written/ more crowd pleasing Massive monster affair. 




 From what I remember, that triggered the monsters release from hibernation or something. They didn't really have a predefined 'lore' so a lot of it is contradictory/red herrings, technically, they released a manga meant to clarify stuff, but that had a lot of supernatural elements (Clover was the ghost of a 14 year old or something)


The funny thing about cloverfield is that with the resurgence of Godzilla, pacific rim, and to a lesser extent things like attack on titan and EVA, the market for 'reinventions of the Kaiju genre' has pretty much dried up, so you really may as well view pacific rim as a sequel. 




 Eh, it will take quite a while to compile all the various sites/theories/magazine articles that I read years ago, but from what I remember, slusho (the company on logo's and T-Shirts throughout the film) having been drilling in the sea to try to find more of a 'secret ingredient' they put in their drinks, I don't believe it's ever specified, but at the bottom of a sea trench they find clover in a crack in the ground, so it lines up quite well with pacific rim. What is most important is that Cloverfield is essentially a generic kaiju movie, just told from an unconventional perspective, so it's as easy to say 'pacific rim and cloverfield take place in the same universe' as to say 'Godzilla and pacific rim are in the same universe' 




 Actually,  confirmed through the viral marketing that he did. Seriously. 




 An interesting note on the voice acting: The voice actor for Melia was Jenna Louise Coleman, A.K.A Doctor who's current assistant, before she was famous. 




 And then I just unzip it with winzip? Thank you for the help! 




 Sorry to ask, but which specifically should I download? Can you give a brief description of the sf/FT/CX stuff? 




 So, I know this has been already asked, but where is the best place to download Kill la kills sweet soundtrack? I unfortunately do not have the means to import the CD. Any links would be much appreciated, I would also like a potential simplification of the animex downloads page? What link should I click on? 




 Actually, DC built up a really large stock of female superheroes in the 90's/ 2000's, but they successfully managed to fuck them all up in the new 52. a birds of prey movie would kick ass. 




 In the 60's: The wasp/jean grey/ sue storm
In the 80's: essentially every character in the x-men
In the 90's: Most of the x-men, oracle starts to develop
2000's: almost every heroine written by Gail simone, particularly Batgirl and Black canary
Now: Marvels's pulled a lot of it back, with black widow and Ms marvel being popular. It's worth noting that most of these characters are actually more famous than Wonder woman in the comics community. I'm a big comics guy, and can tell you tonnes about every one of these characters EXCEPT wonder woman. 




 Geoff Johns was heavily involved with the green lantern movie.... yeah..... 




 Fargo: Sure, in America you'll get brutally, and senselessly, murdered, but at least we're chipper about it! 




 Hey Rythian, this may be off topic, but have you ever watched the anime madoka magica? It's similarly dark and emotionally crippling to this game. 




 Fucking Boddypen. 




 Nope, KLK is not suited for a videogame, the art style is too complex to be done with cel shading, not complex enough to be done with 3D models, not to mention a lot is done in a semi-warner bros style. The only way it could work is as a hand drawn 2D fighter or as a RPG. It's not suited for an action game. 




 47 Ronin, Keanu wanted it made so badly, but you could tell from previews there was no way it wouldn't be a flop. Truly like watching a car crash in slow motion. 




 I think the 'who will play Wiseau?' question will be quite interesting, as the way the book describes him, he's such a bizarre character that it would be near impossible for someone to make him look believable (the accent alone would be really hard to pull off) but if you've read the book, you'd also know you'd never **ever** want him anywhere near your film set. It's kind of like trying to get an actor to play Karl Pilkington; sometime life just throws up characters stranger than fiction. 




 I only started watching anime a few months ago, and I was wondering what anime from this season specifically I should be 'following,' using GIFs  of, that sort of thing. (kill la kill was this for me last season) So what do you, in all your infinitesimal wisdom, recommend? 




 Cool, Sjins getting a new youtube channel! 




 I remember seeing adds for it, it had Cameron Diaz in it I believe? Wacky heist caper? Anyway, I'm guessing their involvement was pretty much buried. 




 Don't forget he came off an extremely directorially powerful TV show, spaced, which even had a quentin Tarantino commentary! 




 Whilst DKR is certainly controversial, (It was my favorite batman movie, subjectively of course) I don't quite think it was bad enough to end the 'streak.'  




 Didn't something similar happen with the Ridley Scott Robin hood movie? Hollywood buys a script for millions of dollars called 'sherwood' about the sheriff of nottingham using Middle ages forensics and detective work to solve mysterious murders, but when they bring Ridley on board, it becomes another Robin hood movie because he wanted to do a movie with archer. 




 Is pyrion a house elf now? 




 I would personally like to see some western Sci-fi games developed into anime. Deux ex, Mass effect, Halo, that sort of thing, However, in terms of what would realistically get adapted a monster hunter Anime could be really neat, but only if they make it considerably darker than the games convey. (graphically) Monster Hunter could potentially have a really interesting world/action scenes if they let it. 
























 Yeah, I don't really deserves to be whitewashed into a 'worst episode ever' hole. at least it took some dramatic risks. 




 I *Think* the general trend is that the more sci-fi guys REALLY hated it and the more 'broad strokes' kind of guys liked it. I *think*. 




 well I *liked* it. 




 Still doesn't change the fact she cloned big boss multiple times without him asking, after specifically saying it was against her moral code in mgs3, creating the rift that ended up driving the patriots apart, as well as drive gray fox crazy enough to kill her. She could well be 'forced into it by zero' or something, but I think that's less interesting than having her do it of her own volition. Her betrayal probably struck Big boss the hardest. He'd expect EVA or ocelot or zero to betray him, they're spies after all, but the kind hearted medic who was obsessed with movies? 




 Ideally, I think he should only appear in some sort of 1970's style flashback sequence. Para medic would probably be a better fit for having an actual confrontation with Big boss, seeing as she was essentially snakes best friend, and a lot of people's favorite character in 3, and she's pretty much the most morally bankrupt member of the patriots. 




 All the patriots in the same room. Think of the tension of Para-medic, sigint, zero, snake, ocelot and EVA being together. 




 Heck yeah I'm interested! 




 It's got a lot to do with how homogenized main male leads are, the only real roles troy baker and Nolan north can't do are the more 'japanese' style leads. (generally the higher pitched voices and stuff) This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I'd personally like to see more variety in main characters in the games industry than 'white, middle aged male' or 'British white middle aged male'  




 Are you using a +15 weapon? I manages to kill him in 5 hits with the BSS +15. Alternatively, two hand a weapon, attack once and back off whenever he attempts an attack. (unless he does a butt stomp, keep close for that attack) The only easier boss for me was pinwheel.

Oh, and if you want to level up, go to the painted world and kill the phalanx, and if you want to skip the fight entirely, feed 30 humanity to quelaags sister. 




 Yep, and unlike Kaathe of Fraamt, velka doesn't dick you around, she just gives you supplies and help to carry out the job. 




 There's actually three main forces manipulating the CU in the game: Fraamt, Kaathe, and Velka. Velka's goal is just to get you to kill the Gods, probably with the occult weapons she basically hands you, and she's the only one who ALWAYS succeeds at her goal. 




 The stray demon is all about dodging and mobility. Two hand your weapon, run up, attack, and then back off when he does the power wave. He's been the hardest boss so far for me too. 




 Yeah, There's also some pretty cool metric remixes on the deluxe version of the 'fantasies' album, such as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-gVPGULgw) 




 Xenoblade chronicles did that.In fact, It's about climbing from one giant dead machine god to the other, evil giant dead machine god. 




 Don't worry bout it man! 




 Yeah, that song got me into metric [pretty much all their songs are that good](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRtd8ArvH_s) 




 Uh, I dunno, those spandex are pretty intimidating... 




 Gah, was I the only one who thought this episode was a great time to re-introduce the [Raston warrior robot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnQVtmYfLtk) AKA the silver ranger AKA crap ultraman? I mean, It would be better than the spider demon we got. 




 but there's a new one, and I remember reading about it being a 'buddy' rank on this reddit 




 Weren't 'buddy' ranks shown on the analyzer though? 




 Well, like a lot of hollywood films, ASM had a whole bundle of writers and rewrites, the most direct culprit of all the 'crap parts' in modern movies is Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman though. 




 Have you been to the painted world or undead asylum? You get a tonne of stuff and levels from there if you're having trouble 




 You can go wherever now. Go to the dukes archives if you want to do DLC, go to new londo if you want to +15 weapons, and go to the catacombs if you want the easiest time. 




 I was in the same boat a couple days ago, but instead of solaire I summoned a giantdad. I took down smough first too! 




 Young fatman. 




 TBH, after mgs2's story, you can't really blame people. 




 It's because TPP is based on Moby dick, which, as you probably know, is all about DICKS, hence the title, and the part where it describes how you can turn a whale dick into a coat or whatever. Therefore, TPP is all about the D, hence DD,or 'double dickin', and quiet being a 'naked sniper' because she's chico and something something reasons. 




 He's just doing it to throw us off the scent, hence why a dog was just introduced, he's saying "You'll have to sniff out the fact that quiet is chico" The dogs eyepatch represents the communities blindness to the fact that quiet is Chico, whilst the other eye represents the true fans who KNOW she's chico. The dog is also called DD, and what do you think quietes breast size is? Coincidence? UNLIKELY! 




 Couldn't kaz function identically to big boss as seen in the trailers, I mean, he has a missing arm too, so all the prostetics could be used no? 









 There's actually a weapon XI in the comics, so he's not even an original character! 




 SO I'm assuming you got platinum this recently to get into the bloodborne Alpha? If not, congratulations! You're now eligible for the bloodborne alpha!  




 If I remember correctly, that room was found, but the trigger wasn't discovered until revealed by the devs. I also think that the code for AA was a lot more complicated than the code for Dark souls. 




 Not really, a month's usually when marketing campaigns start up 




 Yeah, that's the joke, zoey was semi referencing the multiversity 'DC worlds' chart. 




 I thin the real question is where do captain carrot and the amazing zoo crew com into this? They've been out of continuity for so long, they need a comeback. 




 Hey man, I'm also on my first playthrough, lvl 44 and in in exactly the same place. I might PM you, although I won't be able to do mic chat or anything. 




 It could be a version of her warped by the space-time continuum, or something like that. Still, as I said, it seems unlikely that the writers will add existential dread into the show. 




 well there isn't really any evidence for that theory other than a couple lines of dialogue. You have to go through a lot of logical loops to think a kid would reasonably act like that. 




 So my theory for the 'monster' of this episode is that it's actually some sort of time distorted version of Clara. Think about it. She's been scattered through time, every time, every place the doctor goes or thinks about going. We've already seen it go wrong with dalek!Clara, don't you think a universal constant obsessed with the Doctor would create some, y'know issues for the universe.

However, I doubt we'll ever get a real reveal. My above theory is too dark and grand for them to follow through, but it's neat to think about! 




 Hey, I'm playing the game for the first time and I happened to sparta kick a guy off the stairs in that area. How long ago did it happen for you? 




 Yeah, platinum games is japanese, but the makers of dead rising are canadian I think. 




 Actually, this game was made by western devs, just published at capcom. 




 oh really? I don't know much about TRPG's, but I assumed it was simple because it can be adapted so easily. Guess not. 




 I was just thinking this. I think the only one people haven't suggested yet is GURPS, which facilitates these sort of 'simple, generic TRPG' games found on yogsquest. 




 It might be GURPS, or at least, that seems most facilitating to 'generic space fantasy' 




 Yeah, but it was published by DC, so it's a DC graphic novel, the original intent of the book doesn't come into it. If you want to be **really** anal, you can also point out that their was a question/watchmen crossover, so watchmen still is technically in DC comics 'mainline continuity'. 




 But it was **published** by DC. 




 I literally did this 5 minutes ago. I was super excited and then I realized why I don't play horror games. 




 You should really get the HD collection if you liked 4. MGS2 is really weird and peace walker is pretty arcadey but MGS3 is a big candidate for the best stealth game and story ever made.  




 everybody has a different favorite zelda game, mainly because they're meant to be games you play in your early teens. This squabbling happens on every thread on every forum, nobody will every define the 'best' zelda game because it doesn't exist. 




 I'm pretty sure a lot of the female POWS are good at intel, it's just intel units are some of the easiest to grind in the game, and there aren't that many B-A rank POWS, so you tend to ignore the fairly decent female intel units the game spawns in the mid game. 




 Or you can just be any other hero in the marvel universe that's more powerful than taskmaster, I love im', but man is that guy a punching bag. 




 Action movies are meant to be about aberrant cases, they're not meant to be about mediocre tales filled with mediocre people. 




 Well the writer of that movie did Just direct the summers biggest blockbuster so it's pretty justified. 




 Yep, I'm looking forward to the inevitable moon knight movie. 




 The problem lies with the properties that FOX and SONY basically accidentally bought. Deadpool, galactus, the skrulls and various other characters that first appeared in fantastic 4,x-men or spiderman were bought by fluke, and now marvel's run out of every A-lister other than ms Marvel.

 On the other hand, if Marvel had the X-men rights a deadpool movie would have been made years ago. 









 Hey man have you ever thought of doing Civ V videos? Maybe commentary over yogscast ones? Because you have a real knack for it. 




 Although pixar have yet to produce a really good movie since 2010, which is a pretty big problem for the company. 




 That first APC is the first boss you face, so is the most memorable and likely capture. Therefore, since it always produces alligator he's the most memorable soldier, and the most likely that EVERY player has other than the only other unique, Kojima. Since Kojima was already in GZ, hopefully some of the peace walker codenames come back, such as alligator and thresher shark. 




 I thought Alligator was the first one to always drop out of the APC though? maybe that's why, he's pretty much the most 'canon' soldier you find in the field other than kojima 




 I think you misspelled Thresher shark. 




 Hey, do you mind pointing me to the where the alligator meme came from? I've seen it referenced multiple times on the subreddit and tv tropes, but after google searching I've yet to see the origins of Alligator being the most famous MSF soldier. 




 Although, to be fair it was originally Donald Blake becoming Thor, so it does have a bit of precedence. 




 I get where your coming from, I truly do, and I HOPE Ant man is a good or great film, and that Edgar Wrights vision carries over,however, I think the complaints are way more justified than you make them out to be.


1) Joss whedon is in no way comparable to Reed. Joss Whedon worked on the scripts for X-men, Toy story and the x-men comics. He also wrote and directed multiple Emmy award winning shows that had directorially strong moments. ('Hush' comes to mind) He also made Serenity, which, commercial success or not, was one of the best Sci-Fi movies of the past decade. It's dumb to have doubts about Joss Whedon, it's not to have doubts about Peyton Reed, whose made multiple Bad, mediocre, and more importantly generically directed movies.


2) Favreau also made multiple great movies, I don't get why people keep bringing Elf up, It was a great Christmas movie. Alan Taylor directed episodes of the most critically acclaimed fantasy TV show of all time.The Russo's are slightly more comparable but didn't take over from an amazing Action director like, say, Tarantino.


3) I think the most valid comparison is actually another studio. Darren Aranofsky was originally set to direct the wolverine. But got replaced at the last minute due to 'directorial differences.' You can logically apply all the same arguments to FOX, they hadn't gotten it wrong yet, (x-men 3 and origins wolverine are comparable to the incredible hulk and Iron man 2) James Marigold has directed stuff before etc. etc. posthumously, don't you think people saying Aranofsky would've done a better job were correct? This stuff has precedence, it's not completely out of leftfield.


Small aside: Edgar's work is hardly obscure stuff, ESPECIALLY as we have to compare it to British films rather than American films. The cornetto trilogy has been hugely critically successful, and was one of the most commercially successful franchises in British cinema. Even Scott pilgrim didn't lose money and became a cult hit on DVD.


In conclusion. The Edgar Wright fiasco is way more rational that going "wah wah, Gal Godot is too skinny" 




 How are they changing the character? Thor isn't literally changing genders, he's just temporarily become de-powered, whilst someone else takes up the mantel. He's not even leaving the comic! Completely changing the character is like when in the 80's Thor became a frog and solved animal problems for 6 issues, and that is seen by many as the greatest Thor story ever told. 

Comics are about non static characters, 12 come out every year after all, so they **have** to change things up to keep interest up. The harry potter comparison doesn't really work, but actually did happen. In the last two Harry potter books, J.K Rowling not only killed Dumbledore, but set the last book entirely outside of Hogwarts, because good characters grow and change and face adversity, rather than remain static. 




 Whilst I agree with you over the fanboys being fanboys stuff, there's a significant difference between complaining about Joss Whedon (who had already directed two great films, serenity and cabin in the woods) and worrying about Ant man now that Wright's left. Edgar Wright is probably the best action comedy director or the last decade. It's reasonable to assume that Peyton Reed will not fill his directorial shoes, it's am similar situation to the Star trek 3 Roberto Orci thing: There's actual evidence that those people will do a worse job. 




 Why? What is so upsetting about a temporary change during a story arc? It's just whining about writers wanting to tell any sort of interesting narrative. If beta Ray bill or frog Thor were introduced today, people would be up in arms, despite those being two of the best Thor stories. 




 It's because apparently fanboys can't fathom an actor and a character looking different. It's pretty objectifying behavior honestly, and I'm SERIOUSLY surprised nobodies complained about Dwayne Johnson playing Shazam when the character is white. 




 I bought it on Itunes, can I get in on this sweet deal or do I have to use methods other than Itunes to listen in? 




 The cycle is being repeated with the Gal Godot/ Jesse Eisenberg stuff, lambasting people for hypothetical performances. The worst part is that the asshole fanboy always gets to say the last word. If Gal Godot is great, they'll either say 'well she put in a surprisingly competent performance' or they turn up their noses and say 'well, Gal godot did an ok performance but such and such would've been better IMO' but if Gal Godot does a bad performance, fanboys get to say 'see, I was right all along, my fatalistic attitude happened to align somewhat with reality, aren't I the BEST?' 




 Deadpool's really popular actually. He's been in a tonne of games (MVC, marvel ultimate alliance, was a main character in that marvel MMO, was a main character in lego marvel, had his own game that was popular with lets players) been featured in a couple of cartoons and is generally incredibly popular in the under 30/ geek market. He's also one of the bestselling marvel characters, and is prominent in the marvel universe (he's basically the new wolverine, popping up in other peoples comics. I'd definitely say he's the most popular marvel hero with no movie, and if FOX didn't get the rights by fluke, marvel would have made a deadpool movie already. 




 Actually, deadpool is probably the most popular marvel character without a movie. He's definitely A-list and has been in a lot of videogames/cartoons. 




 Funnily enough, I just got the game and, despite the fact I was attempting to fight the Taurus demon at level 9 as a thief, the ascent never bothered me at all, and I had to do it 6-8 times because I was apparently underleveled for the demon. Eventually beat it by going human for the first time and requesting assistance (but not before having to kick a PVP guy off a cliff, again at level 9) what a game! 




 A triple A studio that closed a a year later... 




 So I'm just notifying those unaware right now, but r/games currently has two fairly enlightening threads about the yogscast right now. One talks of the recent Totalbiscuit video outlining problems with the yogscasts new business model 


(http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2arhv6/totalbiscuit_outlines_a_number_of_issues_with_the/)


and another talks of the apparent abandonment of the yogventures game 

(http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2apng1/yogscast_cheat_backers_for_567000_on/)

I realize that this is essentially a link to other reddit posts, but since this is a subreddit dedicated entirely to the yogscast, I think it's important that you're kept notified of the 'current affairs' so to speak. Lewis has also been VERY active on this, so if you have any queries about yogventures or the promos, now might be the best time to say them. 




 Interesting thing about the movie is how it was heavily influenced by the fandom, and in particular fanfiction. Elements like Charlotte and sakuya/kyoko shipping are big in the fandom, as are 'happy endings' so I highly reccomend checking out the madoka magica entry on TV tropes to catch all the nods. 




 Hey, if the EU is non canon doesn't that technically mean that they can 'reveal' Boba fett in empire was a girl again? 




 Eh, It's debatable. It BECOMES part of the narrative, but you can really easily not watch it if you think Ep 12 was the perfect ending. Part of the magic of rebellion is that ep 12 essentially left no loose ends, so it makes you feel like a bastard for requesting a arbitrary (and deliberately) contrived 'continuation' of the story, despite the fact it's over. 




 I would actually say to only watch rebellion if you want more madoka magica content. It's a better film if you approach it with the mentality that you're actively watching to get more content with the characters, rather than assuming it's part of the pre-existing narrative. Rebellion also makes more sense if you read Madoka magica's TV tropes page (after watching the main series) because rebellion also makes lots of references to the fandom.  




 I first heard it from an n64 OOC preview. Death mountain was THE scaleable mountain. 




 Hey, If you like KLK, and want to get more into anime, particularly anime with strong female characters, I recommend you do what I did and watch Madoka magica and Black lagoon. Both have really incredible characters, visuals, narratives and action. Seriously, Madoka magica is 4 hours long yet is my favourite TV show of all time. 




 Actually, the recent deadpool series has had some pretty heavy moments. The negative aspects of deadpool mainly come from the Daniel way run. 




 I think Squirrel girl has little fucks to give about anything black bolt can do to her. 




 Wow. why are you on a film subreddit if you're so ignorant about film in general? 




 Nope, not true. People don't talk about *a fantastic fear of everything* people don't talk about *how to lose friends and alienate people.* nobody was going to see Ant man for Paul Rudd alone, people were hyped about Wright and his fantastic direction. Being dismissive of a good director is being dismissive of film as a craft by Proxy. 




 Shaun of the Dead is not a 'niche' film. It was one of the most successful British films of the decade and is seen as iconic by tonnes of directors, from Tarantino to Romero. It is not niche if it's always brought up in discussion with 28 days later, the walking dead etc. as part of the 'new wave of zombie media. 




 YOU get a babies head with a maggots body crawling through a digestive tract into your asshole! and YOU get a babies head with a maggots body crawling through a digestive tract into your asshole! And YOU get a babies head with a maggots body crawling through a digestive tract into your asshole.... 









 Will magical girl shows ever be the same after revolutionary girl Utena? 




 I never said she was well know outside of comics circles hence the remark about C/D list heroes, frankly, I'm surprised you haven't heard of her, given that you've heard of world war hulk/ Electra (who is pretty b/c-list in comic terms) I don't know why you assumed that I wasn't talking about A-list in comic book terms when you specifically indicated you were talking in comic book terms by bring up World war Hulk. 




 I would say so, Electra has been dead for decades, the fantastic four haven't really been relevant to the big teamups/ they're not really a flagship, and Black widow isn't necessarily 'heroic' although all those characters barring electra are A-list anyway, so it doesn't really matter. Ms. Marvel is a big deal, and she'll become a bigger deal when she gets her own movie. 




 In my mind, 'list' standing is defined by relevance to the actual universe/cross pollination. Carol Danvers is a primary member of the Avengers, Marvel's premier superhero team,and has been for ages therefore, I posit that she's A-list. I would also argue that her DC equivalent, wonder-woman, has never been a massively popular character amongst fans, at least when compared to say, Batman, wolverine or deadpool, yet is branded A-list. 




 She was in world war Hulk with spider-man and stuff, a lot of superheroes were defeated off panel in that mini. Going by that logic ghost rider, who actually BEAT hulk in a fight would be A-list. She's been on the avengers for the past 30 years, and she's widely viewed as the most notable female marvel superhero outside of the x-men, she's A-list. 




 A couple of months ago, Peter parker had been dead for a year with Doctor Octopus controlling his body a *lot* of wierd stuff happens in comics 




 She's A-list in comic terms, but pretty C/D-list in terms of cartoon appearances and the like. Comic's operate on different levels to other media in terms of recognizable characters, for example, probably the most popular marvel hero for fans is actually deadpool. 




 Actually, now there are two Ms Marvels, Carol Danvers has been pretty relevant to marvel since the 80's, (she has been on the avengers for ages, making her A-list in comic book terms) but recently, she became captain marvel and the ms marvel mantle passed on to a new girl, who's comic has only reached issue 4. She's notable for being the most mainstream Muslim superhero, and that comic may also potentially get adapted. 




 I'll replace Paul Rudd. 




 Yeah, that was meant to be Bill, but it's difficult to say how much focus was intended given that that sequence had an entirely different production team. Perhaps the 4-hour cut goes into more detail, what with it having an extended anime sequence. 




 Actually, Iron man has a pretty decent array of technological/magical villains, but because most of the tech villains overlap with captain america and magic hasn't been established in the MCU yet, you're left with a lot of rivals (that were done pretty poorly)  




 aren't they making that movie? It's called the expendabelles?  
























 a lot of that stuff can be explained by Velkas involvement, because returning to the asylum is beneficial to the undead (and allows you to get to the painted world, an area with heavy velka associations, it's reasonable to assume she had some impetus in this stuff.

1) The stray demon has the Titanite slab, and its beneficial to the CU to fight him, therefore, the floor was either broken by a third party trying to help you (velka, possibly gwyndolin) or was broken during the same time dilation that all of Lordran is experiencing (enemies are different in the asylum too, you could have escaped thousands of years ago)

2)Peculiar doll is likely supplied by Velka, seeing as the painted world is the best grinding area in the game, and gives you lots of god killing items, and also has a strong Velka association.

3) Anastacia is the only Firekeeper who still has a body, although why she doesn't dissapear like everyone else is unknown, perhaps it's something to do with the way of white?

4)Rats have a high drop rate because they've been eating humans

5) This is a genuine oversight, much like ciaran using the dark/gold tracers after giving them to you

6) Snuggly can again be explained by the velka association, you put some garbage item down, and the giant crow replaces it with actually useful stuff.

You're confusing **ambiguities** with 'making sense' 




 So you've never played dwarf fortress? 




 WOW Kim is 29? Never realized, she looks so youthful! 




 Hey, with a new planescape game out soon and all the divinity stuff, why don't you give planescape:torment a try? 




 Sarkeesian's ever gaining snowball of popularity continues. To be honest, I'm slightly worried that it'll make all criticism of Sarkeesian be branded 'pro-gamergate' which would kind of suck, as I'm honestly not much of a fan of the 'Tropes vs Women' series. 




 He was on the podcast *before* TB started burning bridges by saying things like 'Sarkeesian's death threats have nothing in them, otherwise she'd be dead'. All of Tb's interactions with Jim have been one sided on  his part, and *I personally* doubt Jim will want to associate himself with I guy who he's pretty opposed to without TB making some sort of sweeping retraction of his GG support. 




 TB's also been burning a *lot* of bridges lately, particularly with his post saying that white privilege doesn't exist, which seems to have soured his relationship with Jim sterling.  




 Someone attempted to do it again with MGSV recently too, they set up a crappy youtube account with weird, surrealist with obscure references to MGS lore, which is exactly the kind of thing Kojima would do. The community didn't really bite though. 




 If you're looking for games with secret finding communities, check out the Arkham city forums/secret hunts. Recently, Rocksteady revealed an Easter egg that was hidden for *years* in Arkham city, despite the fact that the game had a very active secret hunting community (especially after Rocksteady did the same thing with Asylum), the code for AC was pretty difficult to decipher too, unlike for GTA V, so when the guy found the most recent egg (AFTER he found basically every wall with no collision detection in the game) he must have been pretty shocked. 




 Well, the race of larger than average people are never named, but they're clearly separate from humanity (not descended from the furtive pygmy), and are relatively powerless compared to say, Velka, who takes a more conventional 'God' role of manipulating stuff/ not having a human form. Who's to say that the Gods in dark souls are really God's, and not just half giants whom were called Gods by a Humanity which knows nothing better? Perhaps the chosen undead is a vessel to punish these blasphemers? 




 Probably the ultimate demonstration of this is him shooting Darkseid with a gun in Final Crisis, essentially killing him. 




 The vagrant wiki page 




 Ornstein is too tall to be a human, even ciaran apparently isn't human. 




 Vagrants spawn in set locations though, so everyone who dies in that area has a vagrant spawn on that spot. 




 But within the context of the *game* it's not presented in a humorous way, whether or not you think Kojima has the 'credibility' to present such a scene, or whether or not you think that Kojima has mishandled sexuality in the past,thus making him a hypocrite doesn't change the fact that in ground zeroes, it *is* represented negatively, and not in positive light. I think it's perfectly valid to claim GZ or MGS is disturbing or sexist or whatever, but not because of the sexual elements Kojima included in a decades old game. If you're going to claim that, why not claim that Jim sterling shouldn't be able to say anything or sex, considering that he said all that sexist stuff a few years back, and had a podcast which almost entirely consisted of him sexually harassing Jonathon Holmes? 




 It's a fantastic read. The making of the Room is even more bizarre and weird than you would expect, particularly as Wiseau spent millions of dollars on the film. 




 No, I was just wondering why you thought that the bomb was the objectionable part in ground zeroes, rather than pazes poorly written treatment in that game as a whole. Why do you that sexual harassment being played for laughs in one game shows that it's played for laughs (or titillation in another game? Those elements aren't played humorously in ground zeroes, particularly in the "context" of the game itself. Ground zeroes is a very hamfistedly written game, but that doesn't make things like Paz getting raped sexist. 




 Chie and the protagonist (I think) from persona 4, a PS2/vita visual novel/dating/jrpg game. 




 Ha, and on the very day I decided to re-read the disaster artist. 




 Every Hanz zimmer song must by necessity be re-used over and over by television companies trying to make things more 'epic'. Can't wait for Interstellar to be overused too. 




 You've also got characters like Para-medic, who's a female character who is never sexualized, and has an almost entirely platonic relationship with snake. I think it's cool that the MGS game include these elements, as opposed to games that just include a token action girl or whatever. 




 I'm not sure why these elements, other than quiets costume, are inherently sexist (we also don't know why quiet dresses like that/gets tortured yet, whilst I think it will almost certainly be given a bullshit reasoning, we should probably wait for that)


If you're bringing up Ground zeroes, why not bring up the audio tape where the villain forces a kid to rape a much older girl? That game had a shitton of awkward, hamfisted sexuality elements. 




 MGS3 also had para-medic, who is my favorite example of a male/female platonic relationship in a game, and EVA, who was deliberately sexualizing herself to steal nuclear pans for China, which she succeeds in, although YMMV on how progressive that is. Whilst I think that Kojima *does* include some sexism in his games, the games do also have some progressive element. (at least, for a videogame) Hell, you had a romance minigame with Kaz in peace walker. 




 I honestly think Burch was trying to humiliate GG in his original tweet, because the way he specifies Dtoids DLC scores seems like a trap. Dtoid actually gave relatively low scores to the borderlands 2 Dlc, in particular, the  [sir hammerlocks big game hunt review] (http://www.destructoid.com/review-borderlands-2-sir-hammerlock-s-big-game-hunt--242877.phtml) is *very* disparaging of Burch and his writing. I'm really surpised so few people brought this review up. 




 GG seems to be incapable of saying good AAA game is bad because of it's 'SJW agenda.' If they think that liberals are supposedly warping the industry to pursue a 'liberal agenda' they would be attacking Dragon Age and Borderlands and Metal Gear, which are games that go out of their way to be inclusive to people, but they apparently the don't care about ethics enough to let it stop them enjoying games, despite their arguments to the contrary. 




 He did, he kept getting dicked about by the studios for it though. It was announced alongside Hulk and Iron man. 




 Well, it was 'his' movie when he started making it before the MCU even started. 




 Yeah, I did think about amending that whilst writing it. To me, Hornets are inferred by the fireflies and that jazz (It's never really indicated that insects are any different) and a Hawk is shown on the Hawk ring, and I think may be referenced in some capacity elsewhere. Crows are also a pretty common element in Lordran, so we can sort of assume hawks would be able to survive as well (everything in Lordran would kill a regular lion, as shown by how wolves have adapted) 




 So just a bit of lore based speculation. But I've been pondering recently about Ornstein, more specifically, his totem animal, the Lion (or Leo) is a weird exception to the naming rules of the four knights, not only is it the only four knights animal we never see in the game, but it's also the only one given a Latin name, which gave me an interesting idea.

What if lions are fictional in the world of Dark souls?

Think about it, the only thing in the game that comes CLOSE to being lion-like is the Chimera (sanctuary guardian) and the big cats in darkwood, which are both fairly monstrous. How would a lion be capable of existing in Lordran? Ornstein, a famous trophy collector, would surely have some representation of his favorite beast if it were to exist. This adds a interesting dimension to his character, perhaps he looked upon the Chimera and dreamed of a lion, maybe his mother  told him of the man eating monster known as Leo to keep him up at night, hell, maybe, the sanctuary Guardians are actually his pets, which are known as 'Leos' in the world of Lordran, and their deaths cut him off from the world.

It's probably bullshit, but it's my kind of bullshit. 




 I'm pretty sure they never stop coming. 




 Both Jim Sterling, Yahtzee, and Jonathon Holmes have been talking about how Bayonetta a negative female character in their opinion (I saw it a lot on my twitter feed a week ago, as well as comments from Elsa from the Dtoid community) BUT they also stressed that it's perfectly fine to disagree with that viewpoint. 




 Malmo forgets and forgives :( 




 rated PG-13 




 You can find the more synthy version on Itunes. (at least, I think it is) The song is written and performed by metric, who were the real life inspiration for Clash at demonhead, All of their songs have a similar style ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRtd8ArvH_s)  




 Because metric wrote the song. I believe you can find the more synthy version on Itunes anyway. Metrics pretty great too, they have a lot of songs like black sheep. 




 Like what happened with the animated film in the 70's? 




 Although not as badly as the third person review. Those sound effects.... 




 Dwarf fortress is basically all about weaponising babies. 




 And the voice acting, which needs to British to keep consistency with xenoblade. 




 So Destructoid is retroactively wrong for saying the game MIGHT be good, and nominating it for two categories where I'm guessing that every game of the type was there? 




 "Oh Gee, I'm so happy my SURFACE PRO TABLET from MICROSOFT CORPORATION allows me to speak to my friends on SKYPE whilst also playing FIFA with me mates on my XBOX ONE, supplied by the kind folks at MICROSOFT" 









 I was mocking people who thought various plot points were too complicated, such as the Doctor and Clara lying to each other. To me, these elements were easy to understand, and not really the issues they were being claimed to be. However, maybe I just hold too much stock in viewing audiences that I expect them to understand these plot points from my perspective. That's genuinely my bad, I'm sorry. 




 When did I ever say those were the plotholes my hypothetical redditor was referring to? I mean, you do understand I was referring to the absurdity of the complaints, because the way you said "I don't think they did?" in regards to Gallifrey really makes me think that you thought I actually didn't know it wasn't meant to be there (Although I saw a lot of confused people on the discussion thread, which I thought was absurd) 




 She was as flesh out as she needed to be that you felt bad when she died, that's all that was needed. 




 Yes there was, the doctor said she was going to be a companion in earshot of Missy and she killed her. The audience is attached to her, so when she dies it shows how bad Missy is. Whats not to get? 




 I can't believe a character I LIKED dies in a TV show, and I felt bad! What terrible, terrible writing! 




 Judging from the discussion thread, this made a lot of viewers into ten year olds again

MUM why were the doctor and Clara both lying?

MUM why did the master escape gallifrey?

MUM why is it so boooooorrrrinng?

MUM why did Osgood die?

MUM did the master die?

MUM why is the master a girl now?

MUM why did they bring back Gallifrey?

Seriously, its like people were watching the episode taking notes on which plot holes they could complain about to get Reddit points. Sure the episode had problems, like the out of place scene with the portal to heaven at the end, but the bulk of it was great, emotional stuff.
 




 I think it's better to keep lautrec alive from a story perspective. Having him kill Anastasia and then having to fight him to get her soul back is much cooler than kicking him off a cliff, and is relatively intuitive.  




 Konami let's Kojima do whatever the hell he wants, they killed castlevania, they killed silent hill, Kojima is the last Bastion of konami's game dev division, if they were really that worried about backlash, they'd have taken out the child rape in GZ. 




 Well, TPP isn't really that much bigger than mgs2, and that twist didn't ruin Kojimas career, despite the fact that Raiden was widely hated. 




 Fantastic, I really appreciate the effort. Just a quick question, but is anything major from a lore perspective equivalent to say, Kaathe from DS locked behind world tendency? 




 IT's on sale for 3.49 on the PSN store right now. 




 Yeah, I just played through the first level at level 1 without dying, so it is pretty easy, that said, I'm still really enjoying it, particularly the reveal of the sanctuary kid. 




 Since I downloaded it digitally do you mind giving me a quick heads up on world and character tendency? 




 So I'm a big Dark souls fan who just bought demon souls in the PSN halloween sale, do you guys have any advice/pitfalls I may fall into after having played Dark souls? Where do the key differences lie? 




 All over my pancakes 




 Sorry, I only have enough flour and eggs to make syntax error pancakes. 




 You don't have to watch anything, but I DO recommend checking out the madoka tv tropes page, particularly the 'YMMV' page. It explains a lot of stuff about the madoka fandom before the movie was out. 




 It sure was an incredible coincidence that the captain happened to be bluffing when Duncan roled a two. I'm glad Duncans SKILL helped him out in that situation 




 My headcanon is that Bloodborne is set in Carim, the continent that gets mentioned in dark souls, the Continent of treachery and deception, and the worshipers of Velka, god of crows. 




 You should definitely check out the series. The first 2 metal gear games are a tad dated, but are still great games, and do begin the story of the series. MGS is the MSX scaled up a bit with fancier graphics and excellent cutscenes, MGS2 was well ahead of its time in terms of game storytelling, even if it is one of the weirdest and trolliest games ever made, MGS3 is a masterpiece, and one of the greatest action adventure/stealth games ever, MGS 4 is mainly a capper to the series, and peace walker is another amazing game gameplay wise, but has a simpler story. It's really worth checking out the series. 




 Yeah, It's presence on this sub and Lewis and sips twitter feed has been practically non-existent. Did you also know that they also play Civ 5? I would never know that if I just followed this sub! 




 Perfect Blue. You know the movie Black Swan? a metric tonne of its content was taken from this movie. It's also one of Terry Gilliams favorites!  




 Thanks for the late reply, I really appreciate it! 




 It's one of the best farming spots in the game, too. Just cast poioson fog on the clumped up undead or do an AOE and you'll get thousands of souls each time.  




 That's exactly what Kojima *would* say if he was covering it up! 




 Well, one could argue that you should have really dodged out of the way at that close a range, or at least kept a fair distance so not EVERY bead hit you. The dark bead further imbalances an unbalanced game, but the since the only way to get a 'proper' duel is if the other guy plays ball (doesn't gank or use some nonsense AOE, has a perfect internet connection etc) Other than that, the DLC is probably the best part of the game anyway. 




 Well, dark Bead IS a pretty rare and obscure power, at least for the first few months of the DLC release, and it's hardly like Dark souls is that well balanced in the first place. 




 I actually thought the boss fights were pretty fantastic as a stealth combat character. In particular, that boss felt like a highlight to me, as he has fairly low health but you're empowered. 




 Ah, but it's already happened! Think of all the feelings that will be released in players hearts! It will be magnificent! 




 Yeah, I really hope we get to see para-medic in TPP because I'm assuming her betrayal of big boss hit the hardest. 




 MGS 3 still had the top down view at launch. It wasn't until substinence that it became the best game in the series, and it's kind of difficult to give a re-release a 10/10. 




 The twin gargoyles isn't impossibly difficult, the second only appears when the first is at 50% health, and solaire gives them more health anyway. The baldur knights and armored boar are far trickier at that stage in the game. 




 Nope, trying to continue the joke! 









 I think they shied off from making ghost rider tie-ins in event books after he basically won World War Hulk on his own, but chose to let hulk live. 




 Have you fought Artorias? He pretty badly overshadows gwyn in the 'have a proper swordfight' department. 




 Eh, I personally feel that we should wait for the second cour to get a full picture before we judge it. I feel that the duality between Slaine and Inaho was played up nicely and contrasted with the princess/rayet parallels.  




 I like Inaho because he is, or potentially is, an interesting character. He's essentially a cold, calculating, sociopath who happens to be fighting for the good guys. If he came back, after being shot by Slaine, he's probably do way worse stuff to the martians, and that would be neat to watch.

 ' former roboteers from SPECIFICALLY the first series of the UK robot wars, what was it like to deny an opponent the unquenchable thirst of battle by beating them in the pinball round?' 




 The DLC wasn't ever really intended to be conventional DLC either, it was meant to be a bonus for PC gamers. Although because of this, PC gamers didn't discover what amounted to the best area of the game for ages, which made the poor PC port more apparent.  




 To be fair, democracy v anarchy WAS where the majority of the lore and conflict came from. 




 Even though the PC version was bad... it was totally worth it for the artorias DLC. 




 You'll also want to see if you can summon solaire for the fight, and get an xbox controller. The game is NOT designed for keyboard at all, and is unnecessarily hard using it. 




 Because all cut scenes are in engine, which allow's for some neat things like custom gear appearing on you're characters, even in flashbacks. It's similar with a lot of RPG's, you just don't notice so much in stuff like WOW or FFX 




 Shulks in the trailers though. 




 It's due to getting the game to run on the systems. You can't have such massive explorable areas without making a few compromises to textures in the foreground. 




 Looking forward to fans saying every video CONFIRMS YOGPOD RETURNING! instead now. 




 The TOTG is pretty close to the second kiln, isn't it? Perhaps the blast from the kiln reached the Tomb, hence why there's so many worshipping skeletons in Nito's room, who were probably frozen in place when the blast hit. I personally doubt that Nito has anything to do with the curse of undeath. The curse is clearly meant to be alien to the other forms of undead in Lordran, such as the skeletons (body, but no mind) and ghosts, (Mind, but no body) the whole reason for Nito's lack of power is that people have stopped dying conventionally, in fact, one of the themes in dark souls is that *hundreds* of factions (all the covenants, all the nations, the demons, the skeletons, the darkwraiths, seath Gwyn) are powerless in the face of the curse of undeath, and nobody knows who's causing it. 




 Although I have been mobbed by anti abortion campaigners in my British school, so I wouldn't say it's not an issue. However, I don't see why it's interpreted as an analogy for abortion when it's really a pretty basic 'utilitarianism doesn't hold all the answers' analogy. 




 Eh, my personal problem with listen was that it's not ambiguous enough. The alternative explanations make sense to the CHARACTERS, but they don't make sense to the audience. The characters get no evidence the monster exists, but the audience get a tonne, to discount the monster existing, we not only have to assume the characters train of thought, but take the perspective that the CAMERA is lying. We see a hand grabbing people under their beds, we seen a 'child' act nothing like a child and have an alien face. We have to assume that Doctor wrote 'listen' on a blackboard for no reason offscreen, and we have to assume the semi-easter egg of the pressure door subtly whispering 'listen' didn't actually happen. The episode is supposedly ambiguous, but the audience has to mental gymnastics to make it so. 




 DOES LIQUID HAVE PREP TIME?!?!?!? 




 Well, before the boss room (The area with the baby skeletons) you can see that Nito had  a LOT of worshipers, so Gravelords might also have been pretty popular. 




 ah, that sword scaling does make sense. 




 Gough still has huge strength in order to use his greatbow, In fact, all of Gwyns archers favor strength by using greatbows

Artorias doesn't have stats in everything, he's clearly not a magic user. His armor could also be said to be fairly gender neutral too. 

Ornstein is still working for Gwyn, or at least using the Armour that Gwyn gave him. He also has a pretty androgynous armour, so much so that many players though he was a girl in the first few trailers. The silver and black Knights armour is definitely more Masculine than androgynous too,a t least for me, although YMMV on that. 




 I was gonna point them out, showing how mildred is one of the few females usin a melee build, and how she doesn't work for Gwyn. Laurentus is also the only spellcaster who doesn't wear feminine clothing, which further corroborates it a bit. 




 I'm only semi trolling. Everyone under Gwyns command that has a dex or INT based build has a noticeably feminine armor set, even his son, gwyndolin, whereas everyone who uses a strengh/faith build has way more masculine armor. 




 I think it's more to do with Gwyns weird approach to gender. Everyone who uses a DEX or magic build HAS to wear a dress, because only women can do those things, and we need to make you as much of a woman as possible to fool people! 




 Thank goodness, the speculation was getting *silly* 




 As, so the multiple duncans were all just a blip in the system. Glad to have all that speculation cleared up. 




 Ha, I did the same thing on my first playthrough till I got my ornstein gear. It still amazes me how you can run up stairs without falling over. Interestingly enough, that gear belongs to the best spellcaster in the lore after Gwyndolin, so it kind of live up to those stats. 




 Yeah, but I don't think that's such a huge flaw to make the entire episode the 'worst ever'. I enjoyed the whole utilitarianism conflict and stuff.
