 Depends on how we would handle drug addiction as a health issue. If we handled it as a personal responsibly issue like cigarettes and alcohol, it would cost us a lot less, probably even generate income in tax revenue.

 Just pointing out that a little over half those suicides in the U.S. are also gun deaths, so saying that there are more suicides than gun deaths isn't exactly accurate. 




 A gun shot is thought to be the most common and effective way to commit suicide, and accounts for 53.7% of all suicides in the United States.

http://www.suicidemethods.net/suicide-methods/ 




 and yet in your past you did not have school shooting.

The earliest known U.S. school shooting was the Pontiac's Rebellion school massacre on July 26, 1764, where four men entered the schoolhouse near present-day Greencastle, Pennsylvania, shot and killed schoolmaster Enoch Brown, and killed nine or ten children (reports vary). Only three children survived.

 If your options are

a) Your child must quit school and work or they will not eat and will always be employed in a low paying job because they are uneducated and their children will also not go to school because they too must choose working over an education.

or

b) The community will pay for your child's food so that the child may remain in school, receiving an education which will allow them to make more money as an adult and not have to choose between having their children working or getting an education.

Would any parent say "No thank you, I would like my children to remain uneducated and poor"? 




  low illiteracy 

would mean that more people in those countries had received an education and could read, low *literacy* would mean fewer people could read. Is that what you meant? 




 Actually, the family is incentivized to produce educated children who will be more prosperous in adulthood and not need welfare, than children who work instead of becoming educated and will always be employed in low wage jobs.  




 Countries with low rates of literacy, have high rates of poverty. 




 Unless that family lives in in a county that provides public assistance, which was my point. 




 Compare [this map](http://www.glpinc.org/High_Literacy_Clusters/world_literacy_map_unhd_2007_2008.png), with [this one](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Percentage_population_living_on_less_than_$2_per_day_2009.png). 




 The Bible also never condemns slavery or says that marriage is between only one man and one woman. 




 Can you name even one bible that does state that Satan rules hell? 




 Allowing a substantial portion of your labor force to remain illiterate and therefore trapped in low wage jobs is a good way make sure your economy remains poor.  




 If there is no welfare, no child labor laws, no minimum wage and no requirement of education, this is what happens.

 When Hillary Clinton was a teenager, she canvassed and campaigned for Nixon and worked for Goldwater '64, and was even elected president of Wellesley College's Young Republicans club.

Why would they if

the bloated federal bureaucracy couldn't coordinate gun control measures after the fact.

If there is nothing to to gained, what's the point? 









 In the 12 months since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., almost every state has enacted at least one new gun law, according to a database compiled by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Nearly two-thirds of the new laws ease restrictions and expand the rights of gun owners. 

http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/12/10/us/state-gun-laws-enacted-in-the-year-since-newtown.html

If most of the new laws enacted were at the local level and "eased restrictions and expand the rights of gun owners" seems like NRA would have had more of a motive than the government. 




 My problem with this is motive, I don't see how the government gained anything in Sandy Hook. What right do you not have now, that you had just before Sandy Hook? 




 Why would FEMA, the FCC   AT T want the public to think that just any random joker has the ability to hack their system and send out meaningless alerts that should be ignored by them?

 The reality is that our military presence in Australia, Germany, Israel and Japan don't seem to be as offensive to the people that live there as you and Dr. Paul would have us believe.
