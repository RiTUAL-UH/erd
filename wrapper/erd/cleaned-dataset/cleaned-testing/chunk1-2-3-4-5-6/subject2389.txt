 Pennywise the clown in the drain at the start of IT. Tim Curry, stick with Frank N Furter please.  




 There was a case of a conjoined twin assaulting someone in a barroom brawl. It was decided that he couldn't do any time because that would impinge his twin's freedom. And "it is better to let a guilty man walk free than imprison an innocent one.
Here is Stephen Fry on the subject.

 Mine totally is if I haven't gotten laid in a few weeks.  




 A woman having sex with a lot of men is a bad thing. You wanna get laid, I wanna get laid, and hey maybe next week someone we both know wants to get laid. We're all grown ups here. Just don't lie or cheat.  




 First 'grown up' game I ever played was Borderlands 2. It ruined me for all other games.  




 Anything by Tim Minchin. 




 My Doc Martens. They would be the coolest, most comfortable guy ever. And big. 




 "I could care less"
That means you DO care. Idiots. 




 Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. http://hpmor.com/
Because science is awesome and HP is awesomer. 




 Caipirinha. Boom. 




 Not a teacher, buuuuut...
I flirted with a teacher I had a crush on all through school, convinced we had chemistry. 
Ran into him about 2 years after I graduated and ended up taking him home. 
I fucking knew it.  




 I lost my virginity to a millionaire ninja named Dr Clever in a castle in Ireland owned by Eric Claptin.  




 Oh I should specify that this approach is for "cold call" type situations where you don't have a lot of time. E.g. The cute girl/guy on the bus. Obviously if you lock eyes in a bar or something have a chat to see if you actually get along.  




 The best pick up line is:
"Hello, I think you are really pretty. Here is my number. If you would like to call me sometime I'd like to hear from you."
Then walk away.
Make sure the number is written down, don't try to get them to put it in their phone. This way she doesn't have to reject you if she's not interested and she can call or message you at her leisureif she is. It's forward and polite without being creepy.  
























 A dash of Campari in an Amaretto Sour changes the mouthfeel so it isn't so sickly and brings it forward on the palate. Makes it soooo much better. 5mls or so only required.  




 I work in a bar for twat fresh faced 18 year olds and they play this song at least once a night and every person in that bar screams the goat bits. The DJ has started doing that thing where he shuts the music off for a goat scream 2 second sing along. FML.  




 Hold the newsreader's nose squarely, waiter, or friendly milk with countermand my trousers.  




 Well this exists in my town. Video game themed bar. They really committed to it, and it's got some of the best bathroom graffiti you'll ever see.

 Rum and ginger beer.  




 Smile a lot, give them sexy eyes and talk in double entendres. It's not that fucking hard.  




 Pulp Fiction

Butch keyed Vincent's car.  




 Try some different beers. I can't stand lager, which is what people generally think of when they say 'beer'. The clear slightly yellow bubbly liquid that tastes like carbonated piss. 


Try a stout, porter or amber ale. They have a bit more balls and flavor to them. If you're American you should be able to get you hands on Brooklyn Brown Ale fairly easily. Australian, try the Holgate Chocolate Porter.  




 Little girl born with 4 older brothers. Parents let the boys name her. 

Kimberly. 

The pink Power Ranger.  




 So now I suffer somewhat from nerve damage, from the waist down.. but shiiit, I can walk, shit, piss and fuck, I am really, really lucky.


My bro broke his neck too, and even though he's pretty crippled we all just consider it awesome that he can walk, shit and get a boner. You really only need three things when it comes down to it.  




 I HAD A DREAM ABOUT EXACTLY THIS. THIS IS SUPER FUCKING WEIRD. 




 You aren't the only one. 




 Goddamnit. Now I must have it. 




 I got the 4096 tile the other day. I was way too proud.  




 As a girl I'd like to know total number of orgasms, from sex and masturbation separately. I can give myself like 8 orgasms in a 10 minute sesh if I'm in the mood. And technically that's only masturbating once.  
























 Lube sucks. 
 




 I'll PM you in a couple of days with a link.  




 Are you on Spotify? After my exams are done I'll make you a playlist. :D 




 Naww you. Thanks. 




 Al Green. 




 By text, right before I banged someone else. It's a shitty thing to do but I still think that's better than cheating.  




 Like a movie for the first 5 minutes then it just becomes part of how I see you as a person and I stop noticing. 




 Golden Gaytime Icecream - Australia/Queensland. 




 She was great for a little while but then I got bored of her/she got bored of me. 

I still miss those boobs though. 




 Giving in and buying some sleeping pills was the best decision I ever made regarding insomnia.

 Change a car tire.  




 Dude, you have a thick majestic beard. This automatically gives you +100 woodwork skills. No wonder it turned out great.  




 Damnit, I should've read on 5 minutes ago. I just sent a pic of my eyes only to find out I wasn't the first. Ripped.  




 Awww look if she's not used to doing it she might be more comfortable with you finishing on her chest or something till she gets comfortable enough with them/you. 


She might've expected you to take it for a while then fuck her to finish... that's been the usual in my experience. Come in the mouth is appealing to some girls and equally unappealing to some. Communicate. 
























 So by "don't qualify" you mean "cant afford"? Start a kickstarter. I'll send yoh $50AUS. 




 I'm a bit of a foodie and I will spend approx 50% of my income on dining and drinking out. Compared with like 40% of it on rent and bills and such. 


I do it cos I don't give a shit about saving and I like being full and drunk.  




 What? I mean, what? 

I'm a chick bartender and I CAN'T give away drinks to guys I like the look of without getting punished in some way.  




 Have one of mine dude. 
 




 Hey man, I hope you don't feel humiliated anymore. My bro broke his neck and was in a spinal unit too. Everyone there shits themselves. He's out now and still occasionally shits the bed. We just tell him not to worry and wash the sheets. If your people don't understand your medical condition leads to you sometimes having accidents then you need new people. 




 Ambidexterity. Fine motor control on one side and gross on the other. 

No wisdom teeth. 
 




 Eddie Izzard. Unf. 




 Does this work for girls too? I'll try it next time I jerk it to confirm but anyone else out there? 




 Nail biter here. Sorry to disappoint.  




 When I slept with one. It was all legal, 2 years after I graduated, but that first kiss, first nakedness... man I liked him but it was giggly awkward.  




 Roads are public property. Therefore drinking in your car is consuming alcohol in public, which is against the law.  




 Marching in the ANZAC Day parade in the town square I'm lucky enough to get positioned next to my crush. 3 hours of the Australian sun later I get heat stroke and vomit all over his shoes. 


We never got together.  




 Will Ferrel 




 100% agree. I loved Harry Potter and the Artemis Fowl series is the only other thing that ever came close. Don't know what every one else is on about, I loved every book in the series, the ending was perfect and brought it full circle. I bought every book the day it came out, same as HP. 




 Met my ex 2 weeks before I was leaving the country to live in England for a year. 

6 months later he came over to visit me, took me to Amsterdam, Paris and Ireland.

We were staying in a castle in Ireland when I told me he loved me and I lost my virginity to him while Rocky Horror Picture Show played in the background. 

I got the guts up to say it back to him the next morning. Very, very timidly...  
Looking back I think I only said it because it felt like the right thing to do. I love him as a friend still but I never felt as strongly about him as he did about me. 
























 Its my real name. I was new to Reddit. I realize now how stupid my choice was. 




 My brother broke his neck a few years ago and has not cut his bright red hair since. Then he put dreadlocks in it.

So when people ask how he is going I put on a really sad voice and demeanor and say 

"Oh man, it's  been really hard on the whole family but we are getting through it together. Living with someone disabled isn't easy but its something I've had accept. My brother is a cripple: He's a white dude with dreads."

They laugh and I don;t have to go through the fucking story again.  




 Clash Of Clans. I can't stop even though its so stupid. 




 When he looks at my lips. That's when you know it's go time.  




 Beside me on the couch.

 Eugh I know! I can't stand coloured hair and matching eyebrows. I do think the eyebrows could be darker though. Might tint them black tonight.

 Are you in my head? Speed is a nice birthday treat but if I never had it again it wouldn't mind.
Can't give up the darts though.  




 Poking an injury inside your mouth with your tongue.  




 Under what ethical school of thought is this unethical? 




 Share it everywhere.

 I once saw a guy busking with a theremin. If you wanted a go he charged like $2. You should do that. He made over $100 an hour.  




 It scared me how many people have loaded guns close to them. I'm in Australia and I've literally never seen anyone other than a cop with a gun. Y'all are weird.  




 Anything where people sing and are judged.

 What she said. Quit bitching and ask someone out.  




 On the off chance I make that magic post that earns me gold. *hint* 




 Creole and Americana food is getting huge in Brisbane. Its tasty. Not too foreign from what we're used to.  




 Should I bang my boss? He's cute and asked me out before we started working together. I was dating someone then, I'm single now and the chemistry is ridiculous.  




 I SHOT THE LAST BOURBON IN THE WORLD?! 




 Hello fellow Aussie.  




 Yeah I'm a girl. But the saying is "that guy". We all know that guy.  




 I'm a girl, dickhead. Also Australian.  




 Yesterday I failed to make three baskets in a row. Turned around to my friends, said "I suck at this." and threw the ball behind me. 


Through the hoop, nothin' but net. I strut everywhere for the rest of the day.  




 Came here to say this. 

One day my brother told me very seriously that Stephen Fry had died, knowing how much I love him. I was in tears and Googling how it happened when he realized that the joke had fallen flat.
