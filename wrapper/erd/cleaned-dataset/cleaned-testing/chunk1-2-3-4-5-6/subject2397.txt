 Owen libary is my favorite. 6th floor has a great view and usually empty, and the downstairs has the best computers.  Basement of Holland Terrell is also great. or if you like some distraction the first floor of  the CUB is pretty nice

 "I traded it in for  a microphone"

"Yeah I can see that" 




 I'm not the biggest football expert but.. I'm afraid this is a little too true. I think momentum is important for us and Nevada is a school we should be able to beat. Of course if the WSU team that played Rutgers played Nevada I think we would've won. I do however think our home game schedule will be to our advantage since they're against some tough teams but home field advantage will be in our favor. Go Cougs! 




 Not just landfills but the middle of the Pacific Ocean 




 I'm rewatching the show and I just finished Season 7. Over the seasons I think he is one of the most diverse characters  and although it doesn't always make sense I love that he switches persona's each season especially after he gets back from corporate. 




 Don't tell Ayn Rand 




 That's awesome! Now if only the buses were even a little bit on time 



















 I've seen the show too many times so I tend to get seasons mixed up but I'd say for most the show Marshal is a corporate lawyer which according to the show/real life makes a lot of money. Plus Lily has a teacher's salary albeit not great but still. So why are they always seemingly broke? Even if Lily spent her entire paychecks on clothes I don't see how they'd be tight on money, and Marshal's school debt would be bad but I doubt he doesn't have a plan on it. Any thoughts?

 What year in med school are you? I'm hopefully going to pharmacy school next year. Just waitin on that email to come 




 I just hate how throughout the series we're led to believe that the whole gang is always together. Uncle barney and Aunt Robin are always prevalent. But no turns out they all pretty much go their separate ways.

Barney's part too. He just becomes a total loser at the end. Perfect month? I'm sorry but no. And then he has a kid with a random ho whom we know nothing about and everything is fine and dandy. Why have we never heard about this kid before. Wouldn't that kid be Ted's kid's friend? Total shortcut in writing 




 I thought the way it was written was classic himym, definitely not the top 5 worst episodes 




 Anything autism related. I don't even know why that gets discussed on Reddit 




 You may need to explain this further 









 Since when is all of france the size of NYC? 




 That's how I got here. I remember back in 8th grade I had a Coach Z shirt. So awesome 




 I have an actual cat, is that cool? Anyone? 




 That's true but at least Barney doesn't introduce the girls to them. I mean I don't break up with someone then show off the latest person I'm seeing to my ex 




 Ok, thank you for actually coming up with a reason. Of course I wouldn't discriminate against other races. I don't think there's a country in the world where every single person is unattractive  




 Are you trying to make me sad?

 I don't get your logic why is it necessary to be attracted to every single Asian group? I mean if you think Italian girls are hot does that mean you have to love Polish girls too just because they're all European? 




 My parents are putting me through college and I thank them all the time. I mean it literally wouldn't be possible otherwise. Working full time at the same time as college wouldn't be enough, and that would be darn near impossible anyways 




 As a college student I can say there's a direct correlation between time spent studying and grades on tests. However I don't really get hw I just have to memorize tons of stuff 




 How is thinking chinese girls are cute racist? And no one asked you to reply to my post

 Good thing I'm lipid soluble 




 "Look is this gonna happen or what?" 









 The last episode just really made me bitter towards Robin. I feel like she was the reason the divorce happened. Sounded like she only cared about her career and never spent time with Barney 




 I asked this too awhile back. General consensus was that was just Barney joking 




 And now you're into human sandwhiches 20 years later?

 I always wanted Ted or Barney (either one really) to marry Wendy the Waitress. She's one of the best looking girls on the show and looks fun. Maybe I just want to marry her :( 




 This may sound weird but I've always thought smoking in old movies or like this picture looked cool. I don't smoke but damn OP's dad just makes it look awesome. Just that relaxed look

 Yes in fact these 2 motions are analogous to said fingerbanging 




 Did anything cool happen or did you just mail them back? 




 I can just hear those ribs cracking 




 Chucks/vansheels. always 




 My cross country team was an absolute joke. We did far worse stuff than wave, like skipping across the finish line. It was fun though 




 Yep, had this happen to me once. The dude came to my car, opened my door, and yelled at me.  To OP, that is a horrible situation and I hope the guy gets thrown in jail for a good long while 




 Chad's bad 




 I definitely agree. Although I did love Archer Vice. Glad it's goin back to the original format tho 




 I thought it went well. They were pretty casual and only asked about 5 or so questions that were all what I'm sure any pre-pharm person would have answers to.  Then they let me ask questions; I had a notebook of them written down so I just asked away. And they were all super nice 




 Did everyone back then just have thick black hair with perfect hairlines? 




 MC Escher that's actuallly a genius title for this. I'm still confused.. 




 Plus the timeline seems all screwed up. I watched Death Note in like 36 hours and I couldn't believe the plot of the sho was over the span of like 6 years 




 All mine was accurate except math. It went from 73 to like a 63. I was not happy 




 Thanks for the advice everyone. If anyone else has questions about the interview process I could probably answer them after today

 Watch all the cartoons my parents wouldn't let me watch. All those missed Pokemon episodes..

 I'd love to wear a button up and tie on occasion. I feel like I'd look weird though 




 Sorry you have had bad professors. 

I myself am a Senior here at WSU and have mostly taken classes in the Bio/chem departments. I have to say with the exception of my Engl 101 TA every professor I've had has been great. They are all experts in their fields, have been very good with explanations and keeping the class interested, and all their tests have been fair in accordance with the syllabus. Even the difficult classes I wouldn't complain about because they just require more studying.

If you are thinking of coming here, please do.  This is an awesome college with great programs (especially engineering).  Go Cougs! 




 Funny you should mention that. I just failed my first Immunology exam, and I too would agree it's been my hardest class to date 




 Rough wasn't it? Feels great to take that last chemistry class though 




 Could be high school, college, grad school etc. 




 I live where it gets sub freezing for the whole winter. Got one of those 3 in 1 Northface ski jackets and it's one of my best investments. Totally worth it if you plan on using one for years

 There's definitely a group mentalitiy in the workplace. If everyone there is friends with each other and happy then there's less chance they are going to leave.

 You always hear about business owners giving people shit for giving them bad reviews. I don't know what's going on here 




 Not to bust on the show here but after Who Wants to be a Godparent I can't blame him 




 Wow that is a daunting task

You should include a count number for all the scotches Ted and Barney drink

Now that I think about it is Marshal and Lily the only people who don't like scotch?  




 It's always fun when you show up to the date, see she looks nothing like her profile, and instantly know the next 3 hours are going to be awful.

Off Tinder though the girl was actually awesome and we had coffee and sang in the car. Of course, at the end she said she was one month away from actually being 18... 




 Not only that but that's a really famous line. How do you fuck up the order of it 




 Dangus the Mangus 




 Because no one wants to go into the dentists, so you have people who come in already hating you. Then you have a rough schedule to keep between their responsibilities. And people's mouths are gross

 Seriously! In high school I was pretty quiet but people would always ask "are you alright?" Like yeah I'm alright now get out of my business! 




 Last week I finally finished Atlas Shrugged after months of reading it. I'd post my thoughts of it on here but too drunk and too many thoughts of it ha 




 Favorite book from high school.  




 Dude you are on a roll today 




 I like that umbrella part. I've also heard that With Tracy it was already raining, but with Robin Ted had to make it rain 




 That's exactly my point really. He's basing his whole exodus based on a republican be voted in next. Well who knows what the next republican might be like. Maybe he'll change America for the better 




 You do realize there have been more Republican presidents than Democratic ones right?  




 I think 100 million is a little much for this situation. For most people here that'd be over a million per year, and that would already be far more than most of us make. 

But Like other people said set up long term investments 




 That the girl you think is into you is definitely into you 




 Well my one item would have to be the check the lottery people wrote me. Then go back in time say the 40's when I can actually use the check. Of course then my present lottery winnings are worth fortunes more. I then buy the US government, bang the First Lady of the time. Then I'd die fighting in Germany whistling a Charlie Parker tune 




 Math. Which is weird because I can do physics/chem type math but actual math classes I've never been good with. I think it's the lack of application the book's present 




 I've done it a couple times. Met up with this one chick, we smoked and watched a movie. Later we were making out and she wanted to have sex but I didn't go through with it, kindof a weird time for me.

Other time she ended up being like 45 and again I didn't go through with it 




 I just want to work at an independent coffee shop in Seattle and live in a crappy apartment. I'm a senior in college now and think about seriously doing it all the time :/

 Back in 8th grade my friends and I counted down the days til Battlefront 2 came out. Now I've been waiting years 




 The episode that's an entire freakin documentary of Robin Sparkles makes me want to punch somebody.  I mean it was funny at first but I feel like it became more of an inside joke for the actors/writers than to us the audience 




 TIL adenosine=adrenaline from a high school bio student 




 Same here and since Ted says it like 20 times in the episode I figured actually saying bitch each time would be a little ridiculous. I agree though c word makes more sense for reactions 




 I work at walmart and we have chip readers along with the magnetic ones. The chip ones seriously take at least a minute to read (sounds short but not when there's a line). If we're gonna use the chip readers they need to optimize them

 A ball point banana! 




 I wouldn't say Marshal is two dimensional, but sometimes I feel like his personality is all over the place. I feel like they add traits to him for jokes but they don't always make sense for his charaacter 




 Fully agree with the changing thing. They made it sound like their only reason was "we want the kids to look like they're still the same age." Well through some more makeup on them because the Season 9 HIMYM is not Season 2 HIMYM 




 The only food I think of with Wisconsin now is their frozen custard. I wish I could eat that forever 




 How do they get the mail? 




 Grabs spork 




 I felt the same way. I think my biggest complain is they left out not only major characters but the major plot that went with said characters. We miss a lot of the conflict resolution with the film

 So after his face smashes into the steering wheel he thinks hmm that was nothing, guess I'll keep going. Then gets stuck again 




 A paragon!! 




 my 8th grade IMs.. I shudder to think. In high school the girl I always talked to wanted to go back and read them one day but I refused 




 I thought that word died out awhile ago. And I hate people who act like they're making Sperry's cool, as if they haven't been for like 100 years now 




 I've only seen this on the internet and still don't know what it means or how to pronounce it 




 Pumpkin beer is probably my favorite seasonal. The flavor is good but only for a short bit so one month of it is perfect

 This episode has the classic fun fact of Barney previously not knowing how to drive and yet in this episode he has a license. Not only that but what appears to be a rented sports car

Meanwhile Ted is far too nice like always and Stella is a grinch as per usual 




 The episode where Marshal gets dating advise from Barney and fails miserably. They make up at the end though 




 Thank you!!

 Yeahh. Had the show been like 3 seasons it would have been fine because we knew it was just about meeting her. By season 9 though I think us fans wanted to know all about her, not just the shadow. 




 I don't think there could possibly be an answer to this. If you think about it, he would have to be describing everything people are saying and where they are etc. It's sortof the difference between reading a book and then just watching the movie 




 Slap a vest over that crime scene of a tie 




 The douchebags are replaced with crazy people yelling at nothing. One time there was this old dude with his hands raised yelling "THIS! I CREATED ALL THIS!". It was funny though 




 My 3 hour layover in Atlanta was pretty much awful 




 I know right? My family used go on ferry rides from Bremerton just for the views 




 Only club in the Palouse maybe 




 I think it's totally unfair to Halliday what happened to him and I hope he recovers.

But this will be a great oppurtunity. Since this season is more or less over anyways Falk will get some good training in. Then the next 3 years he can continue on building a strong team and Mike Leach can steer him in the right direction 




 Thanksgiving day, in my opinion, is one of the busiest travel days of the year

I just want to punch her 




 Yes, and the stuff she said which everyone claimed to be funny just because she's not they type of girl who would say those things, was just painful to listen to 




 Yeah and that's because he looked like the definition of old school cool 




 /rising 









 What's with these?

 I don't know about jail but certain parts of your body would be a little too exposed for the impending plate throwing 




 I love craft beer but there's just those nights when I need me some PBR 




 I don't understand why he had to manipulate votes anyways. He got like no less than 500 points on anything he ever posted plus gold half the time. He said he downvoted info that wasn't correct, but people only paid attention to his posts anyways 




 Same here. They're easy to order, they dont leave you drymouthed like jack and coke, and you look cool 




 This is what always gets me. They're like yeah 1000 will pay my kids school, oh 60? Good thing the casino is right over there 




 I'm a college student who got rid of fb. It's really not that bad, you just have to use email more 




 So that he could once again talk to Tony and get his sweet archaeologist gig 




  If people upvote it, that means it's good content, plain and simple.

The people who upvote are probably the same people who forward emails 




 That may be, but the people commenting =/= the people upvoting. Theres plenty of examples of thousands of upvotes, but the few hundred comments are all negative towards the image. Usually the comment section is people who truly care about the quality of pictures on here 




 They also have soup. 500 50 oz cans of Chicken noodle comin my way 




 Ok wrong word lol. Not something you'll have the rest of your life.  




 You just sit on them and glide around the gym and of course smash into anyone in your path. Of course it ended in one of 2 ways: Your fingers going under the wheel or the thing tipping over also crushing your fingers. 




 Yes, I work at walmart so walking around a lot so when I started working I bought a pair of Nike trainers and they've been amazing. I see my coworkers wearing chuck taylors and can't imagine the horror their feet are going through 




 Seriously. I mean I know everyone has that thing they like to spend their money on but buying coffee however many times a week is an astronomical amount of money on something that's not even tangible 




 Artificial sweetener like Splenda. Probably not the best but look how common it is now 




 I'm not sure what the WUE is but 1) I think if you applied now you would get in and 2) if you wait til December I think that's still plenty of time before the deadline although I don't totally remember

Plus doesn't your application update when your new SAT score comes in? I think it might 




 Keep your eyes out on CL 




 At least 3000. This is the type of thing where you just make a milkshake that's 1000 calories 




 Oh yeah I giggled for like a minute at lacrimal caruncle 




 is it the evidence of abstinence? 




 Initials plus lord helix since I made this when twitch plays pokemon was happening. I guess its just a cultural reference now 




 So should I take tests while hungry as well? 




 Yeah I watched all of Scrubs then someone tried to get me to watch house. House is just a dick minus being funny and I figured every episode was going to be like that. 




 I just think they could have labeled way more things, and way cooler things too 




 That's actually not that bad. Especially in that glass case, looks super nice. Plus all those random things put together some of which aren't exceedingly common. 




 First off this might be long and I don't really expect anyone to read it...

Anyways, first time I read SP was a couple years ago or so and now I'm rereading them for about the 50th time.  And every time I read them I get this "feeling". And I think it's that I sort of relate to Scott in that I tend to elate things in my mind, and I'm also really clueless about girls emotions.  For example, Scott and Kim's relationship how she never stops caring about him. I know I've unintentionally led girls on in the past and I feel like a jerk about it. But by the end of SP we realize that everyone has done things in their past that were bad, or they regret, and it's a nice thought that you can move past that.

I also love the books because I (and I'm sure everyone) goes through the struggles of life (school etc.) and SP sortof has that simple carefree life and it reminds me to just not worry about things as much.

Anyways, those are just a couple reasons why the books are awesome. Maybe other people relate to the books in the same way, but either way thanks for readin 









 Was that a recording of a crappy tv from someones flip phone circa 1996? 




 I've seen girls at my school walkin around in the smallest dresses of all time and heels in the winter on ice 




 I love the hair fwoop even though he doesn't have long hair 




 I know a big thing in their minds seems to be that "you're just not the one" but seriously. Especially when they are already like 35 years old and it seems to me like they have everything except that one spark that it takes.  They do end up going on more date in season 6 (?) and at the end Ted says it's just not going to work. I guess it always just seemed a bit forced that they don't get together 




 I always kindof thought that was off. Doesn't a judge have to be impartial? 




 coh-STANZ-a 




 Hope the cadavers in my anatomy lab appreciate these 




 She also tries to run off to Spain using the money they don't have when Marshal is being an environmental lawyer. Sounds more like something Barney would do 




 He is exactly what you need. No more, no less. 




 The thing about Jar Jar is that I've grown up to hate him. Ewoks are cool though 




 Us plebeians down here can only dream 









 That one girl towards the end just chanting in the dudes face. Such fury 




 That's what I thought it was until the end when everything just went on as is.  Ultimately though I think it was just a way to showcase the actors talents. Either way I thought it was a cool scene 









 Then years later marry the girl who helped him to live 




 I should, totally ruined my night 




 Yeah guess I got ahead of myself there thinkin I was goin for the easy kill 




 It was the best burger in NYC 




 If you're talkin Rogue Squadron there was the AT-ST walker level, the Tatooine race with the T-16, the cadillac, the millenium falcon, naboo starfighter. I love that game 









 Who's Zed? 




 I love Scrubs so much. The difference between JD and Ted is that JD is like hmm I haven't been laid in awhile guess I'll pull the doctor card and pull a hot girl while Ted overthinks everything 




 Technically that would still be 0 
























 Okay, I'm just going to ask this.
Do you really want to come back from this? - 

What's that supposed to mean? - 

Architecture is killing you, Ted, and it's killing us to watch it killing you.
You're like that goat with the washcloth.
You want it so bad, and every time the world tries to take it away from you, you keep grabbing it.
But you know what? It's just a washcloth.
Why do you even want it?

 Because I have to be an architect.
That's That's the plan.

Screw the plan.
I planned on being a famous artist.
Marshall planned on being an environmental lawyer.
Robin planned on being a TV reporter.

Found it 




 I'd say that was only because of Zoe though and her motives, not him not enjoying the building process 




 She basically tells Ted to quit as an architect and just give up on everything he's worked for, saying it's killing him and killing them watching it kill him. She also compared his career to the rag that the goat was eating saying "why do you even want it so badly". To me it just seemed so anti-himym advice.

I don't really like Ted's answer though saying "that's the plan". It's not just the plan to him it's what he loves doing and I wish he had said that instead 




 Ambulence rides are like 6 grand though aren't they? Unless I'm dying of anaphylactic shock I'll just drive myself 




 I guess it could be a little ironic since in one episode Lily tells him it's a made up word 




 Patton is also rated PG from what I remember. I've never heard so many swear words in my life 




 In Mother Russia fedora tips you 




 I think that was the first time, and Barney does it in a later episode as well 




 My possible theory is that it's them pronouncing her name wrong, to me Scherb(o)tsky sounds much more correct and I don't think Robin ever pronounces it with an A sound 




 I have the green hemp shoes and the soles wore through in like 3 months, which is unusual for adidas I don't know what happened but I was sad 




 Trains are crazy. Not to be the physics nerd here but the amount of mass a train has even with little speed it still exerts an insane amount of force 




 I thought it was cool, but I guess it was more cool actually being there 









 I can look more like Kurt Cobain! 




 Kinda looked like that! Also sorry for the terrible quality 




 Preferably the SEM for this situation 









 My friend said it great, in LoTR they made every single orc, the most copy pasteable thing imaginable, to look different and therefore awesome 




 Sorry for the late reply but yeah like the other person said it's just not likely, especially if they were both goth to your point 




 That is very cool. It's also super foggy right now so fitting 




 Been to WI a few times my self, on a scale of amazing to orgasmic how great is frozen custard? 




 You forgot this / 




 Wasn't Lily a goth chick from high school all the way through freshman year of college? Not saying it couldn't happen but to me it seems a bit of a clash, I guess it's for a joke though 




 The booster and the cars with the metal bottoms not that plastic. Gives them way more momentum 




 It's really no wonder Ted is hung up on Robin forever. They live together and Robin basically puts him in a state of perpetual jealousy, or rather they put each other in that state. Sure ex's can be friends but not like that 




 It definitely has some of my fav episodes: sexless inkeeper, playbook, last cigarette, girls vs. suits, etc. I thought it was good as well 




 In WA it's like 9.50 now so very different across states 




 Never done Greyhound but Megabus is definitely the way to go. It was comfier than my plane ride 




 Aint nothing like a Liz Lemon party cuz a Liz Lemon party is mandatory

edit:thanks for the fix it's been awhile 




 The amount of history and lore that came from this is actually amazing. In those few weeks books were written, memes were created, and much time was wasted typing "up" or "down" 




 I played Slime volleyball with my roomate last month ha. I still got it 




 Hans Gruber, international bandit 




 Had you said blinds I would've been freaked out 









 No but his mom is always a special 




 This would be more creepy if he wasn't so loveable  




 We can build one in Tacoma. Oh wait.. 




 Terrorists last word's are "begosh" 









 I believe there's a song about this 




 I thought it was kinda funny. Maybe I'm just missing the show more than I thought though 




 True. I think a big reason I'm making a bigger deal of it is because I've hung out with OG katelin a couple times this semester ( in college) so probably remembering it more than usual 




 It does seem to be pretty common. Thanks 




 That is very true, I think you're right 




 She's my friend's girl's friend and we may all go on this double date thing this Friday. Is it weird that she has the same name? Well I know it's weird but more like is this a deal breaker?
---   

Also I've met like 5 girls with this name in the last year so I've pretty much given up on trying to meet a girl with a different name

TL;DR Thanks guys
 




 The girl I may take out on a date has the same name as my last. Weird? 




 Didn't expect to cry today but umm.. okay. :( 




 Am I doing this right? 




 Not asking this girl out because I was leaving for college like 5 months later. Shoulda gone through with it 




 Marshal is decent looking ( I think? I'm a guy) and a lawyer. Plus funk band

Lily is pretty hot, kindergarten teacher, and hot dog eating champ 




 I find tinsel distracting 




 He also betted Marshal off 




 Is that Spokane, Washington? I always wondered b/c I live by Spokane and it's a big city but didn't really think anyone outside of WA would know about it 




 Well she had very recently moved to NY at that time so yeah guessing they were friends but not yet really good friends yet  




 I'm hardly an expert on this but I believe this is why you will suddenly get the urge to poop. Your internal sphincter will get a signal and relax enough for it to exit 




 And just to mention the external one is voluntary but there's an internal sphincter that is smooth muscle and beyond conscious control 




 I suppose but how about when the majority of people worked in factories, or the Great Depression where people barely even had jobs. Then they worked at least 40 hrs a week and barely got paid for it 




 I always have at least 2 lab tests on Dead Week. Makes it a serious time crunch 




 I keep seeing this on Reddit but really what generation had this luxury? It's pretty much been hard work for America right from the beginning 









 Well apparently OPs other repost 5 hrs ago wasn't successful enough so he brought out the big reposting guns 




 If you're thinking about Owen I like using there computers alot more than Holland Terrell. the seats are way comfier and they are always open 




 Local bounty hunter. Doin the King's dirty work 




 Started selling Kirby vacuums. I did quit only like 2 weeks in b/c I knowingly went in to it thinking it was a scam but it still was a bad experience 




 Immunology. Not only is the material very expansive and detailed, the professor is also insanely hard. The tests are 100 points except for the final which is 200 and they are very tricky mult. choice and lots of in-depth application short answer questions. It's a very interesting class but damn it's difficult 




 Usually really happy/fun but occasionally mellow/down. Sort of depends on what I was thinking about that day 




 My biggest complaint was that it had the worst search function of all time 




 That's the worst part. Slutty graphic tee's for junior high schoolers 




 I know when Ted was in Barney's dressing room Lily comes in asking for Ted that Robin needs him. I can't remember if she said best man or not though 




 You would have to say Thank you for browsing random 




 The depression under your nose is known as the Philtrum 




 Where do the hoes go?? 




 How bout when people out of state drive on our roads? Do they then have to pay? 




 Sort of like the Styx concert
 




 And Spike learns you can't fix everything by kicking it 




 The year I owned a Ruckus was the best of my life. I owned those open roads. 30 mph at a time 




 My day always starts off with 3 eggs in a breakfast burrito with Pepper jack. Best breakfast ever 




 I'll have to see. Usually nurses and the like love me because my veins pop out a lot 




 That would be an impressive resume if she could actually do all those things 




 Same here! Although last time I donated I got really faint and my arm hurt for days. It also took a really long time, like I saw people come and go in the time I donated. I should try again though.  




 I tried it last Halloween. I don't really like sugary drinks but it definitely tasted like a tootsie roll 




 That's just ResNet (happened in Stephenson). With deadweek here I'm sure you can expect more of it in the next 2 weeks 




 Sports games + Finals 




 The style reminds me of a TF2 character 




 Except what's in those what appear to be locked drawers at the bottom? 




 I've noticed in my travels that if you are anything more East than like Chicago people will assume D.C., but for us Seattelites most people around here assume the state 




 Like Pepperoni only sexy 




 Hey, Reel Big Fish and Streetlight Manifesto will always be on my ipod 




 I feel like skinny jeans will always be a thing. At least for me I have pretty skinny legs so they are just better fitting 




 Who told you to put the balm on? 




 I just chug water before going to bed. Works every time 




 Boot up the computer and ask /r/askreddit what to do 




 Live in Seattle and work in a pharmacy. Either in a hospital there or at a retail place 




 For one turn off your phone, even one text can get your mind distracted for minutes. Also (IMO) studying can be a lot like working out. It's hard to focus at home with so many distractions and going to the library to study is the equivalent of going to a gym 




 Best of Van Halen. Panama is such a kick ass song 




 Don't feel bad about driving slow, especially down hills. It is much more manageable even if you start to slide 




 In WA it's half that.. but I'm sure it's quite different in NY 




 And why did I continue to watch it till the end? 




  It's just too much money for what you get

Definitely this.  I walk everywhere nowadays and these kinds of shoes just don't hold up anymore. I still buy them though.. Good insoles are important though 




 Ochem lab. Most people did not take the "slowly pour" instructions seriously with conc. H2SO4 and the vials basically erupted when people poured the stuff in. One person got serious burns on their arm 




 There are a lot of houses on Greek row that could potentially be awesome if they weren't so run down 




 /r/beertrade 




 the other half is in Iceland. According to pics anyways... 




 Brings back the horrible memories of after-school care in the lunch room for me 




 Hot water plus a cold beer and some alone time. At least for me 




 I love how you drew the fracture in with it. Good anatomy! 




 I don't know who you are but that's blasphemy 




 I've pretty much always hated Lily. But yeah the worst part is the writers acting like her actions are justified. She always does terrible things and at the end of the episode they try to spin it on some way that makes it alright. And yet, hardly anything she does is right. 




 blues Brothers will always be my favorite movie. It's hilarious, its got blues music throughout, and more talented actors then you can shake a stick at 




 And why does Irfanview not have 1366x768 as a default picture resize option? Or Gimp2 as well.. 
























 This is one of my favorite episodes. Everything Marshal does at the party is amazing 




 Well Robin still seems to hang out with Barney when he's teaching Randy how to live. I doubt Lily ever really hangs out with Barney and Marshal is usually with Lily

I do feel that Ted would be more mad with Robin though, not just shrugging it off 




 This honestly sounds worse than anything the kids would be doing 




 Used to work at a McWalmart. Would not recommend  




 Maybe the flag glasses are deceiving  




 The Seattle native in me has to say that there is much more things that are "worthwhile" to do in Seattle than those, not that those aren't fun either 




 Lost it by the gas station by Stephenson.  It's a gray vans wallet. I posted on CL too but if anyone finds it I'll give them a reward.  Thanks   Go Cougs 




 This has one of my favorite quotes from Barney

"Was the Blair Witch easy to deal with or did she haggle over the closing cost" 




 I've had some life changing epiphanies in there 




 And you're an anti-dentite! 




 ITT: Wegmans 




 My guess is oxidized piss 




 That *is* a tasty burger 




 http://imgur.com/CjgwRnk 




 I love how they attempt to get back into formation while also fleeing for their lives
 




 ehh they were probably gonna die anyways 




 It is fun, by senior year though it all starts to sound the same. If you're a freshman though go and enjoy it! 




 Why does everyone hate this episode so much? I think it's far from the worst

the part that always bothers me is Lily's terrible gun handling skills 




 Lately it seems the "cool" thing to do is like the ending regardless of original opinions of it 




 I loved the finale and have never heard the whole dead theory, then again I'm 22 so wasn't really aware when the show was airing. I really like this explanation though 




 Well there goes the next 48 hours of my life 




 That chicken is oddly proportioned 




 Good, I get paid in potato 




 It amazes me how many people here (in WA) think that just because its legal doesn't mean employers won't test for it and turn people down 




 S2 E10, James wears that same tie.  




 This is what the infinite staircase felt like we^just^need^the^music

 Suitjamas I believe 




 Do I get a vote? Skank lane! Skank lane! 




 This makes me sad too because I think he's a great actor. he just got caught up in Pirates far too long 




 People would always dare others to do this and I'm like 'I'd do this anyways'  




 HIMYM and 30 Rock I thought both had great hooks from the start 














 If you've never read the book this is a great one to read, even if you don't like reading. This whole operation was pretty crazy and the book tells it from a lot of perspectives, including some stories of Somalians 




 My dad is a pilot for Alaska so him trying to hurt their business because he was late makes me mad

 If i had my phone in my right pocket and wallet in left pocket that sounds really uncomfortable. Is it better than  I'm picturing it? 




 Figure out how you study best. I came in Freshman year thinking it would be enough to look over the study guide a couple times and be solid. Did NOT work out. You'll score a lot higher if you know how to study well

Also study a little bit every day instead of cramming, if you do this you'll have all the time in the world to go out and have fun 




 The funniest slaps are when they're not anticipated IMO. After Slapsgiving they all? have an episode solely based around it 




 I think it's hard to say given that it was only season 1 and their plans for how the show would go were a bit different then. It is an interesting point though since he seemed pretty fixated on something that would not bode well for Ted and Victoria's relationship 




 There's that episode in S9 where they say you can have that one "you can't ask me why" request. But in Season 2 Marshal asks Lily a favor when she returns to NY but she can't ask why 




 Star Wars Battlefront. I've probably spent a couple hundred hours on Bespin Platforms alone 




 Whenever I chew gum it's as if I've completely forgotten how chewing works 




 I think most trending subreddits are from askreddit threads. It's always funny to see a post there and then the next day the subreddit its trending
 




 I'd say he's one of the very few people who actually pull off autotuning, I love 808s 




 I mostly agree with this. I'd also just say that any good music today isn't the catchy type of song that you would hear being sung in a bar 









 He didn't have a coke 




 My OChem professor used the chalkboard. OChem 2 used powerpoint and I hated it 




 Let's not forget John Belushi either. The Breakfast of Champions skit is hilarious and probably not even close to his funniest performance 




 I agree that they rushed their relationship a lot. they dated for like 5 episodes? It didn't really help that the next episode was The Playbook, where Barney actually uses their breakup to his advantage. I didn't really like this episode either though it was painful watching Barney and Robin being total jerks to each other 




 I'd say one reason is because a large portion of both guys and girls here work out consistantly 




 Ahhhh.... ohhhh.... 




 Holy fuck. The wing actually scraped the top of it. I can't imagine how loud and terrifying that must have been 




 Constantly rubbing my fingers together. I just can't stop for some reason 




 I thought it was to make them haters look back at themselves

 I'm predicting 1 mil views by tomorrow and a special on some news channel

 Tim's Jalepeno chips are perfect 




 Wyoming. I think they ranch there?  




 I guess we're bday buds 




 The entirety of E. WA is 1.3 mil though so King Country alone has more than the whole other side of the state. This isn't an argument for money but more for voting and the fact that E vs. W has different needs 




 Easily one of the best episodes, not only because the acting is great but every character is engaged.  Ted wearing Tweed and becoming the sexless inkeeper and Barney's hilarious poem. Then Marshal with the gouda and Jason Segel's great singing video montage (meow). Then Barney and Robin being a "single" couple. "Just the 2 of you?" Lily getting upset with Marshal for springing the video and then getting in trouble for inviting the other couple for a weekend away too soon. And finally Ted'd own poem and Barney's look of regret at the end for being in a relationship " What have I done!" 




 I just hated her reason for wanting to save the Arcadian. She grew up in it? I get the sentimentality but the fact that the snake infested building could be replaced with something way better that affects everybody would've been much greater.

Yes I know the lion stone headwork is iconic!! 




 This and the time it takes to gather the courage to go ask. I used to sit the for 15 minutes debating whether to go talk to them or not. Now it's like 2 beers and a couple minutes 









 3 months ago was a good time for this repost 




 Fine I'll take on that role tonight 




 Cheap tricks?! Not one of these is a cheap trick.
Except for "The Cheap Trick.
" I'm the bass player for Cheap Trick.
And even that one involves expensive hair extensions! 




 I laugh everytime at this. To me this is truly clever humor 




 You're right I had it on best 




 This is the top comment, though. 




 Black, purple, and teal were the official colors of the 90s. Just go look at the sweaters in thrift stores 




 4th grade powerpoints were allll about these. Of course putting a picture in the clear text was the best 




 That's what really confused me. They end up breaking up and instead of going to Barney who she claimed to have feelings for just goes back to Ted 




 I mean it's hard not to feel that way. We can only really take Ted's word that he loved the mother but we never really see it. I mean yes for a few episodes but not compared to the years we've seen of Robin 




 I used to always think Barney, but over the years I've changed my mind to Marshal. His speeches, singing, he's an actually good person but will still do stupid/funny things. He's an all around character 




 2 gen chem labs in a week *shudders* 

If you do decide to do that I'd advise not taking another class along with it that'd be too much 




 "Who the hell is that guy?"

"That's Shin-Ya, he's sortof been auditing the class" 




 How bout Modern Marvels? Also great. Or when they actually played Rome and WWII documentaries all the time

 Not sure what the hate on Stephenson is about. I had lots of fun there. There's tons of people so you will find someone that has similar interests, it's no more than a 10 min walk anywhere, it's got tutoring in the building if you want that, and if you want to party you'll have no trouble finding one 




 I always thought that according to Marshal's he didn't wait nearly enough time to go out with Barney after Lily left him 




 I thought this episode was good too, the classic himym retelling of the same story. Also, there are just faaar worse ones than this all throughout season 9 




 Was the name of the dorm Stephenson..? 




 Beanie girl is looking longingly into his eyes 




 I almost forgot about the Balloon Robin thing. almost... 




 Not only that but any microbe on the babies skin the mom probably already has antibodies specific for it 




 Freshman year we actually managed to throw a decent party in someone's corner room (bigger than most dorms). All of a sudden an RA came in and there was alcohol everywhere. One dude there decided to go into the bathroom and punch the paper towel dispenser so hard he ended up busting up his hands and the police were called. Then this girl ended up puking on the floor of the corner room and the RA had her escorted to the hospital. It was basically chaos for a bit. I managed to walk out and despite them getting our student IDs down only the person who punched the dispenser got in trouble.  




 Mini putt. I've been playing it for like 10 years now never gets boring 




 That picture does not look to scale at all unless that fountain is going to be huge 




 I'd say the porn one was realistic in an edgy sorta way. The cliff one and bday one were a bit funny. Everything else made no sense 




 I've only really seen him in 30 rock and I love him in it. He does sound a bit crazy in real life but I can deal with it 




 Loan words? 




 I don't know what that is but sounds awesome 









 Probably because he sounds like a 14 year old 




 I couldn't even finish that. When she says "how can you sing about this with little kids listening to it. Don't you have kids?" Like Fuck it's up to the parents to not let their kids listen to that, he doesn't want little kids listening to his music it's not his audience
