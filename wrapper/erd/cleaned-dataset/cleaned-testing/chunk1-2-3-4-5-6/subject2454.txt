 What's the cream they keep rubbing on themselves before training? 




 A lot of them have trouble traveling due to visa issues or whatever.  So, could it be possible to have a fighter that simply does not fight in the US?  With as many international shows as the company puts on, many countries have much more relaxed visa programs than the United States, so it would allow a fighter to build up a resume against top quality opponents on international cards.

Why couldn't Glover fight in London, Abu Dhabi, Australia, Canada, or Japan (and of course, Brazil) in the last two years under a UFC contract while his U.S. status was being sorted out? 




 Holy fucking shit.  What a god damn disgrace.  Unfortunately, Dana sees nothing but potential ratings with alpha douche nozzles like him, so we'll keep getting these assholes in TUF and in the UFC. 









 Two sites I've noticed are Pinemeadows.com, and Gigagolf.com

-Both websites claim that their clubs can play as well as the big name brands for a fraction of the cost.  Any thoughts?  Are they legit?  Or will these clubs fall apart after three holes? 




 I would like to use my savings as collateral (roughly $25k), since I have no fixed assets.  I think that's called a cash-secured loan, right?  My question is, are the big banks the only option, or are there websites out there that can help me shop around for good rates? 




 I would like to input my league info, and have the analyzer recommend free agents and trades and what not.  I currently use Ziguana, but they are kind of confusing sometimes, and I was wondering if there is anything better. 









 Jered Weaver and Josh Hamilton.  Weaver is 30, and Hamilton is 32.  Which one can sustain their dominance longer?

Edit:  Thanks for all the advice.  I was gonna trade away Weaver for Hamilton and some prospects, but I feel reassured in my decision not to. 

























































































































































































































































































































































































































 I haven't been contacted by mods or anything like that.  Just some political correct and oversensitive "just a few bad apples" religion defending types.

I do this to highlight the backwards culture that I was raised in.  As an exmuslim who's lived in Muslim countries, I have more experience with Islamic brutality and injustice towards women than most.

If political correctness demands that we never say anything negative about Islam, then I will stop posting here.

 
























 More interesting are the mental gymnastics being played by the more liberal muslims, trying pull "no true scottsman" arguments out of their asses left and right.

 Iran is a shia country which claims to follow Shariah law.  But whenever they enact a new law, or carry out a severe punishment of an existing law under the guise of Sharia, most muslims will say "They are shia, so it doesn't count, etc..."

My question is this:  Is Shia sharia so severely differnt than sunni shariah?  Most of the differences in the two sects are historical and are based on theories of succession after the death of the prophet.  So how does this make their laws any different?

When they execute adulterers/whatever, is it not the same sharia law followed and understood by sunnis?

I understand that there are some serious differences in beliefs.  But the laws carried out by Iranian authorities rarely reflect those differences; rather they are laws which are held by both sunnis and shias.

If I am wrong, please correct me 



















 I see videos of these guys posted here quite often, and have been wondering why?

Why these guys above other scholars?  Is it because they are young, and have a better time communicating with the youth?  Because, honestly, their message doesn't seem too different from what the older scholars say.

TLDR:  Just wanted to know why you guys are fans of these guys.


EDIT:  That title should say "What is it..."  sorry, typo. 




 A lot of people here don't subscribe to /r/atheism because it is a cespool of memes and facebook screenshots.  But there is also a lot of substance there.  Most of the good discussions involve Christianity because that is what most western atheists are familiar with.

There are a lot of good links to videos and articles in this subreddit that don't get the attention they deserve because there are just too few of us.  We want /r/atheism to join our cause, but we don't want to get meme'd to death.  

So why not cross post all the good articles and videos from here to that sub?  Are there rules against this?  




 Basically, should I be working out?  My understanding of juice fasting is that we are severely restricting our calorie intake and relying on the nutritional content of the vegetables we ingest to sustain us.  If we start working out, will we just eat through our muscle, since we aren't putting any protein in our bodies? 














 Meaning, is there some kind of device, like an XM satellite radio receiver, but for internet radio instead? 




 It's called Les Mills Pump.  I know this is the P90X sub, but I see Insanity discussed here a lot, and didn't know who else would be knowledgeable enough to give insights.

My question is, for weight loss, is this as good as p90x?  The reason I ask is because I am very intimidated by p90x, and I believe that I must do another, less intense bootcamp before attempting p90x.  Especially because of the cardio and pull ups.

This Les Mills Pump workout seems to be all weigh lifting, all the time.  I know the guys at r/fitness would probably like it because they pretty much rail against cardio whenever they can, so I came to ask you guys. 









 It used to be that in order to be best-of'd, someone would be providing some great insight into an unknown subject matter for a curious redditor, or some great act of kindness that went unnoticed.


Now, it just seems like every pun thread, or even slightly funny joke gets posted here, as if the OPs want credit for finding some hidden secret of reddit that no one else on the entire internet has seen.

But I guess such is the say of reddit.  After seeing the downfall of Insanity Wolf, r/WTF, and r/trees, we shouldn't expect anything less. 




 Gegard Mousasi and King Mo come to mind.  I remember a few years ago people were talking about a Mousasi-Machida superfight.  Would that kind of fight be beneficial to both guys?  What about King Mo?  Being a former Strikeforce champion has to earn some cred in the UFC, right?

 Yes, Wazzym's x-post piqued my interest.

My question is, what are some of core beliefs in Shia Islam that diverge from orthodoxy?  When I ask sunnis, I obviously get biased answers like "kafirs, heretics, blasphemers, blah blah blah"

From my very brief reviews of various writings, it seemed that Shias were a little more objective in their treatment of the prophets companions and wives, and didn't hold them up to "saintly" status.

I understand the Imams and all that nonsense.  I want to know more about their views on hadith, the sahabas, and wives or the prophet. 






































































































































 Obviously, this is a VERY deep league, so even marginal players like this hold a lot of value. 



















 THIS IS NOT A DEFENSE OF THE WORD MUZZIE.

I'm trying to get actual answers through discussion.  I don't want to turn this into ZI's defense testimony.  I don't want a referendum on political correctness.  I just want people's opinions on this specific question.

I've had this conversation with only one redditor so far, and we were able to keep it civilized, so hopefully the 
same can be expected of everybody else.

edit:  please let's not turn this into an /r/atheism "socrates died for our memes" type issue.  I just want to know how people feel about this ONE question. 








































































































 I brought up a Las Vegas meetup before.  Most of the meetups are localized to big cities, so those of us in the boondocks can't really go.  

But if we were to have a destination vacation type meetup, people would have plenty of time to prepare, and we could have shit loads of fun.  Plus, most summer cities are cheap as hell this time of year, like Vegas, because of the weather.

Does anyone have any real interest in this, or am I just high?  (I'm not high.....yet) 






























































































 If these guys are fighting like this for him, Dana should put him in that front seat at every event. 




 One of which was blatant misogyny.  When we talk about the women who follow islam being misguided and acting against their own benefit, we aren't being sexist.  We (at least I) are talking from a place of pain, after watching our mothers, sisters, and wives fall victim to this brainwashing.  Calling out that bullshit on this sub is not misogyny.  It is venting.  We have no where else to talk about it, because no one else understands where we are coming from.

No other apostates from any other religion in the world have experienced the gender inequality that we experienced/participated in as muslims.  This is a huge point of frustration and anger for us.  So please, SRS, don't come into this sub and tell us how we should feel and/or act about this.  This is not your sub, it is ours. 

I can't speak for everyone, but I'll tell you how I feel about muslim women.  I feel the same way about them as Liberal democrats feel about poor rednecks who protest against Obamacare.  People who are opposing their own interest/well being/safety.  Islam is not safe for women.  I personally feel that muslim women are brainwashed into believing the exact opposite.  I have the right to these beliefs, and I have the right to share them without being called a misogynist.  So take your overly politically correct sensitivity training back to SRS, and stay out of our business.

Are my feelings coming from a source of male privelage?  No.  They come from knowing the freedom of experiencing how wonderful life is without the soul crushing and life defeating menace that is Islam.  It ruined my life.  It is currently ruining my mother's life, and that of my sisters and female cousins. 

Is there anyting you SRSers don't get mad about?  If I talk negatively about women who don't see the harm they subject themselves to, I'm a misogynist.  If I talk negatively about muslim transgressions and abuses, I'm an Islamophobe.  What exactly is the name of your world, where everybody loves everybody, and religions respect each other and don't cause hardship to women and conflict all over the world?

Just leave us alone.


edit:  I apologize for the overly possesive "our sub, not yours" comment.  Of course all are welcome here, but the discussions shouldn't deviate from this sub's purpose, IMO.

 A golf buddy of mine says he is trying out a new swing that has him keep all his weight on his left leg throughout the entire swing.  He says it helps him with balance, and he is getting more distance from it.

He advised me to try this swing, since I'm still relatively raw in my skill (best score 97).

Have any of you played around with this swing(Balance on left leg almost entirely instead of even distribution)?

I've been told that for short shots around the green, this is great for not losing balance and hitting the ball in every which direction, he is insisting that this should be done on longer shots as well. 

























































































 It's disgusting.  On the one hand, muslims and their apologists throw out their "NTS" arguments, and in the same breath, claim that man cannot judge another man's intentions, and only God can judge.

It's hard to believe that they are typing the words out, reading them, and actually seeing no contradictory hypocrisy there.

AAAHHH.  MAAAAAY.  ZIIING.

 


































 The copy I am looking for is published by a prominent Pakistani company, whose name I can't remember.  This company's Quran publications are used in madrasas all over Pakistan and some parts of India.

Of particular note, this version contains 16 lines per page, as opposed to the more popular 13 line versions that are so common nowadays.

Is there anyone in Pakistan, or does anyone have connections to Pakistan, that could help me get a copy?

I am in the United States, and most, if not all, masjids here are filled with Egyptian or Arabian publications which contain 15 or 18 lines per page.

 Not really a question.

Doug Marshall vs. Sultan Aliev.  What. The. Fuck.

That was the most horseshit decision I have ever seen.  It was complete domination for three rounds by Sultan Aliev, yet somehow Marshall gets the decision in front of his hometown crowd.  What a fucking joke. 



















 Is he too big for MW?  He is 6'3", and shredded like lettuce.  He looks like he has 0% body fat.  Could such drastic weight cutting be adding to all his muscle problems?  

I don't think his injuries are fake.  I think he might be suffering from being one weight class too low.

 78"

I think this might be the factor that gives him his greatest advantage over his opponents in the middleweight division.  His reach measures a ridiculous 78", which a lot of heavyweights don't even have.  Similar to Jon Jones, he is extremely successful at using his freakish body to keep people away.  No one in the MW even comes close.  Hell, even Cain Velasquez only measures 77".  People clamoring on about how Machida, Mousassi, and Belfort will destroy this guy seem to forget what JJ did to two of those guys (And I'm a diehard Machida fanboy).

Will Weidman have the same success as JJ?  Who knows.  Jones' greatest asset is his intelligence in the cage and his ability to adapt to opponents mid fight.  Weidman seems to be able to do that so far.  His striking still looks weird and sloppy to me, but he's got a fantastic coach that is continuously refining that aspect of his game.  His wrestling prowess is already known.  The only unknown seems to be his submission game, and like Jones, we haven't seen him in a position to be submitted yet.

Am I talking out of my ass?  Who knows?  Probably.  But does anyone else think that his incredible genetics will keep him at the top for a while?  Why or why not?  If I'm making a stupid argument, please break it down and call me a noob or whatever.  But until someone convinces me otherwise, I'm hellbent on believing that his 78" arms are gonna hold on to that belt for a little bit. 

I'm not saying that reach is everything, but Jones' dominance stems from his ability to use it effectively, and so far, Weidman seems to be learning from JJ's sucsess.

Anderson Silva's reach was also a ridiculous 77.6".


Cain Velasquez: 77"

Cigano: 77"

Travis Browne:  80"

Bigfoot:  82"

**Jon Jones: 84"**

Rashad:  75"

Phil Davis:  79"

Gus:  79"

Glover:  76"

**Weidman:  78"**

Machida:  74"

Belfort:  74"

Mousassi:  76"

Jacare:  74" 









 I honestly want to know what weakness people believe Meisha can exploit to get a win, and how?  KO?  Sub?  Decision? 













































































































 We're talking Cigano.

I personally think he could benefit from a Machida camp.  If anyone knows how to not get bullied by wrestlers, that's the guy.  I don't think I've ever seen Machida grinded against the cage like Cigano was last night.

Or if not Machida, then perhaps a Munoz camp?

What are your opinions? 




 Three major upsets in college football, followed by a #3 vs #5 ROFL stomping by FSU.  Then Boston wins the god damn pennant.  Then, the UFC puts on the most entertaining card possibly in their history.  In all the excitement, I neglected hockey.  Anything interesting happen? 




 A few years ago I traded B.J. Ryan and Alex Rodriguez for Ladanian Tomlinson.  It was weird, but both teams benefited since they were both dynasty leagues.

Same commish for both leagues, so he allowed it after thoughtful examination. 




 His targets and catches have been steadily increasing.  He's a big boy, and Stafford seems to be trusting him more and more every week.

 I'm not culturally caught up with celebrity drama, but Spike's recent AMA sure did bring out a lot of haters.  I counted at least twenty people call him a piece of shit without explaining why he's a piece of shit.

Dynasty league with 40 man rosters.  These are the available 3B options in my league, and I just traded David Wright for a shit load of prospects, including Sano.  I'm not in title contention, and I've stocked up on draft picks for next year.  I just need a 3B to finish out this year.  I don't want to be accused of tanking, and beyond that, someone owns my first rounder. 









 UFC or otherwise.  I just want a schedule to follow.  I get most, if not all, of my MMA news from this sub, and it's been great.  But the lack of a calendar or something is quite frustrating.

It wouldn't even be difficult.  We could do it like the /r/IAmA sub, and just list the events that are coming up.

Any thoughts?  Or am I being too unreasonable? 















































































 This is literally the worst time to do so.  Your friends and family are going to be more religious than ever, and this will cause a greater chasm to form between you and them.  We all know, and have experienced, how even the most even keeled liberal muslims go batshit crazy during Ramadan.  Because of the fake nature of Islamic spirituality, you really have to pick and choose the right times to fight the right battles.  Ramadan is not the right time.  Neither is Hajj season.  Stay away from those two events on the calendar when making life altering proclamations to your family.
 




















































































 There is always a  ^  in front of a pitcher who is starting that day.  I check my rosters every day.  Well, today, Yahoo did not have the  ^   by Travis Wood or Dillon Gee's names.  I completely missed Wood's start, and just barely got Gee into my lineup.

Has this happened to anyone else?  This is not the first time either.

 Is this the USA network's attempt at a gritty corrupt cop drama like FK's "The Sheild?"  Because if it is, I don't think they will succeed.  If they want to stick to their USA formula for dramas like Burn Notice, and Cover Affairs, they'll be alright.  But trying to go gritty when you have no clue is just unwatchable television.  A lot like TNT's failed cop drama two years ago with Dylan McDermott called "Dark Blue" or "Deep Blue" or something like that. 




 It is not a credit card, but a charge card, so it does not report any hard limit to the credit bureaus.  But if I spend money on it, it most certainly does report that information.

Will my credit take a hit if I close it?  It's is a pretty old account, and it does have an annual fee.  It was advantageous to get it at the time, as I had no credit.  But now that I'm doing ok, should I close it out?

 I agree that a vast majority of cops are good, honest people. But the anger you are seeing here and other online forums is brought on by a feeling of utter helplessness. Where are the people supposed to turn for help when the ones assigned to help them are causing the hurt in the first place? 




 It's kind of a cop's jib to escort a woman in labor to the er, or talk a jumper down. Public safety and whatnot. Strange that you think those actions are somehow above and beyond the call of duty, when it is in fact the very description of their duty. 




 Imagine any decent qb with moss in their prime. He sent three average at best qbs to the damn pro bowl.

 confirmed 




 97.9 seems to be the most active rock station as far as the music scene in PHX.  They do local music shows, band auditions on the radio, as well as being heavily involved in small venue concerts.  Also, that station actually plays rock music, and not just pop rock that you'll hear on KISS FM or JackFM. 




 wot 




 My mind's telling me noooooo 




 Phoenix has phenomenal radio stations, and a really thriving rock music scene.  When I moved to LA, I realized how good I had it.  Everything here is just generic genericism.  But I guess I should expect no less from where pop culture is born.

 Let's not forget the CEO's extremely cringey "Every man must care for his own soul" post after the fappening fiasco.  He didn't have the balls to just say that he didn't like the bad publicity (which would be completely understandable), but he had to go an make a moral argument, which was weakened by the fact that he allowed the sub to remain for as long as he did, enjoying the benefits of the increased site traffic.

 Lol, the admins were definitely not quick on the ban.  They let that shit slide as long as they were getting clicks and ad revenue, but once Anderson Cooper did his story, and that one guy (violet something?) was doxxed, they swept in on their fake moral high horse.

 Here is a breakdown from urser /u/twewy

[Dude, that opener + combo was a work of art.
Right feint, left ready, sees the guard go up, shoves the left in there, follows it up a combo to make sure he can't afford to put his guard down, right hook, left hook, right uppercut, left -- just kidding! Right hook. Change it up, make your opponent frustrated and impatient.
Tattoo man wants to look, he wants to peek, you don't take six hits blind with nothing to show for it. Ben waits for the peek, and shoves another left in there, this time an uppercut, following with an opportune right hook to take advantage of the weakened guard as it moves inward, over compensating for the uppercut that was just received.
Tattoo man realizes his mistake, and solidifies his guard again -- but wait, we've seen this pattern before! You don't win fights in a ball guarding all day!
Ben's been building this guy up. Tattoo man hasn't gotten a single SWING out, let alone a solid hit. Ben knows he'll want to make a move soon, so he pauses, just for half a second. Where previously he had driven half a dozen punches in to make sure no room was given, he waits this time. Ben knows the timing perfectly. Tattoo man takes the bait, there, the guard is dropping, right arm is swinging back, this is going to be big, but fatally slow to start! Ben's faster, he already sees how this will play out. Duck and weave, quick left disrupts the knock out haymaker, veers it off course, and the motion he's practiced thousands of times puts him under now-wild right. Tattoo man hits air, can't adjust his momentum, he's vulnerable, he's open! Bam, right hook straight into the jaw, lights out. Insurance left misses, target's already down.
TL;DR Ben's a cold-hearted, calculating bastard.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/2xzs0z/how_acting_tough_can_get_you_knocked_out_in_20/cp50xkj)

 Holy shit, this would suck major donkey balls.  I've been to Skaagway, Alaska a few times, and I thought that was a tiny hell hole.  Literally one main street that goes for three or four blocks.  A few blocks for residents, and one block for shops that cater to the cruise ships.

Town population with all the seasonal employees during may, june, july, and august is around 800.  That drops to half that in the offseason.  Which always makes me wonder:  what do the people who stay during the winter actually do, since tourism is the economic driving force?

 It's been true for a while now.  I haven't worked in a retail store for about 15 years, but I used to work at Kohl's, Target, and Academy Sports.

 could you share your next parlay? 




 As far as the draft stuff goes, in my best league, we keep track if all extra stuff in a Google docs that everyone can access, but only the commish can alter. Off season trades, draft pick trades, farm teams (for baseball), and other stuff. 




 Just be flexible, but dont allow yourself to be walked over. I had a baseball commish that was hell bent on having a defensive stat, so he started the league with an 'errors' category. After years of complaining from the other 11 owners, hr unilaterally changed it to another defensive category. The other owners wanted to eliminate the category, but he wouldn't even consider having a vote. Six owners ended up leaving the league after almost a decade in.

On the other extreme, I had a commish who would just implement whatever rules were suggested by two particular owners. We ended up with ppr, points per rushing attempt, points per passes completed, extra points for yac yards, and 8 defensive starting positions.

Both if these types of commissioners suck the enjoyment out of the game

 I seriously don't remember the faux intellectual bit.  So I looked his ass up on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foghorn_Leghorn)

Foghorn Leghorn[3] is depicted as a large, white adult Leghorn rooster with a stereotypically Southern accent, a "good ol' boy" speaking style, and a penchant for mischief

I read through the entire bio.  Nothing about being an idiot. 




 I don't remember Leghorn using the absolute wrong words.

 You have no idea what he's talking about because he's trying to use big words and getting them wrong.  Apprehending =/= comprehending. 




 Also, you used the word "apprehending."  That makes absolutely no sense.  Did you mean "comprehending?"

 No worries.  I set aside a small budget for entertainment, and my sports betting falls under that category, so I don't over spend.  If I lose a big bet or series of bets, that's just my entertainment budget finished, and nothing more.

 This is why you people(ex-Muslims) are few in numbers

The reason why we are so few in number is because those of us not public with our apostasy fear for our lives from bible thumping (quran thumping) muslims who genuinely believe we should die for our own personal choice.

Funny how there was no choice given to most of us when we were assigned the religion at birth.  




 I come from an Indian background, but I've seen this mentality prevalent in almost all religious families around the world, where they are so concerned with what people think of them from the outside, that they don't care to fix their families from the inside. 




 I haven't been doing it consistently.  But 20 years ago, I started leading and I had no choice, since I was a minor.  As I grew older, and my balls got bigger, I started refusing.  First passive aggressively by taking night classes in college that directly conflicted with taraweeh schedules.  Then, as I got a job later on, I would just tell people I didn't feel like it.  If people really pressured me into it, and it would seem like there might be some blowback to  my parents in terms of ostracizing, then I'll begrudgingly do it.

But I've garnered a reputation as kind of a smart ass that talks back and correct everybody's bullshit pseudo science opinions on Quranic miracles, so now they only come to me when they're desperate. 




 Of course it has awesome food.  Every big city in America is gonna attract international cuisine.  The thing is, does DC have anything that is strictly DC?  Or does it kind of fall into Baltimore as far as food influence goes? 




 To be fair though, I've heard that Geno's is way overrated any ways, and to get a real cheese steak, you have to go elsewhere, not so popular. 




 That's fucking purple. 




 I don't know.  Does /u/gallowboob shamelessly repost and pass things off as his own?  I never thought he was a reposter, just a mass poster. 




 There are fucking billboards about the rape problem.  Holy fucking shit.

 Yeah but you can totally tell, right? 




 Although really, once is enough 




 Haha.  I've been leading taraweeh for almost 20 years.
