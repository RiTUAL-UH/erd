Snapchat doesn't make any money

Instagram BARELY makes any money...

I can go on and on...but how many of these social apps and e-businesses/websites truly are interested in making money? 

From what it seems to me, many of these firms are looking for buy-outs from bigger firms...not actual inventions that change people's lives and improve social experiences or fix problems. 

A lot of the instant fame and accolades from the creativity of the app world may start out with a legit interest in creating something fun and enjoyable, but when it comes to making money, so few of these items seem to be able to truly turn any legitimate profit outside of the endless pit of buyouts and acquisitions.  




 It stuns me that theres not one available for the iPhone...and I'd much rather have my phone than an extra piece of hardware.

Plus, if I needed it for a test or secure location, i'd know it.

 Again, why does that mean you have to kill people? 




 Lets not ignore RACISM AND WHITE SUPREMACY as well 




 we have video from inside the event that was live-streamed and you're saying its staged? Hilarious.

 Yeah they are. LOL
 














 
Why can't muslims respect western values of freedom of speech? 









 Well, they are geographically closer to islamic countries

 Something I wrote a while back when someone said I couldn't "prove" barack is an atheist, or at least really someone who is privately very liberally religious.

***About his mother*** *"This isn't to say that she provided me with no religious instruction. In her mind, a working knowledge of the world's great religions was a necessary part of any well-rounded education. In our household the Bible, the Koran, and the Bhagavad Gita sat on the shelf alongside books of Greek and Norse and African mythology. On Easter or Christmas Day my mother might drag me to church, just as she dragged me to the Buddhist temple, the chinese New Year celebration, the Shinto shrine, and ancient Hawaiian burial sites. But I was made to understand that such religious samplings required no sustained commitment on my part. Religion was an expression of human culture, she would explain, not its wellspring, just one of the many ways and not necessarily the best way  that man attempted to control the unknowable and understand the deeper truths about our lives."*


His biological [father](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama,_Sr.)? Atheist.

His [mother](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/obama/chi-0703270151mar27-archive,0,2623808.story)? Atheist AND anthropologist (understanding human society and behavior)

His [grandfather](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Armour_Dunham) and [grandmother](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madelyn_Lee_Payne_Dunham) that raised him? Both vocal atheists (talks about this a lot in his books)


Simply put: Black people aren't getting elected if they're not religious.

Visit [**/r/BlackAtheism**](/r/BlackAtheism) more and we discuss this in detail.

Quotes like this and that [speech from 2006](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvKX16Eygs0) he did where he espouses his problems with referring to the bible show me that hes a closet atheist/very agnostic person that is playing the game of political musical chairs.

Don't forget this: http://i.imgur.com/BVt0i.jpg


He "found" god @ 26 as a community organizer in Chicago and if you know chicago, theres a lot of black people there and you're not going to get famous there, as black man, without the black vote which comes from black churches. He had to play the game.

Grew up in extremely diverse settings, i'm sure having memories of madrasas allowed him to contrast that with the radical christianity in america....

Hes one of the smartest presidents, *on paper*, that we've ever had. Remember, they tried to make fun of him because he went to the best schools in the country? I mean come on as if being a biracial kid raised by a single mother (even though she used to work for the Ford Foundation...LOL) isn't a massive hurdle in life.

Every chance he gets hes always promoting STEM fields and human achievement. Not willy nilly passive goals. 

He rarely says that prayer influences his decisions a-la Bush 1 or 2, or even the possibly closet atheist that clinton was said to be. Faith is never a member of his team of decision makers.

When he forgets to pray people blow their lids off and call him unamerican. He left god out of the verbatim recitation of various historical [documents](http://theydontfoolme.com/118/three-years-in-a-row-obama-fails-to-thank-god-at-thanksgiving/) and [speeches](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/25/obama-god-thanksgiving-speech_n_1113295.html) and [9/11](http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/09/11/fox-omits-the-facts-to-politicize-9-11/189827)

Hes not religious **At all.**

Every time he opens his mouth about christianity it sounds [forced as hell](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/21/obama-religious-quotes_n_1292116.html).
I'm not going to go into his politics or anything...but I think to call him a closet atheist, is not a far stretch at all. I know /r/atheism loves the "wheres the evidence" claim, but to be honest here. [Obama has had more secular groups at the white house than any other president](http://content.usatoday.com/communities/Religion/post/2010/02/atheists-meet-with-white-house-officials/1) , a point verified by many fundie-right wingers; so i'm sure they'd be honest about feeling threatened. He only refers to religion during times of [tragedy](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/02/obama-on-faith-praying-for-egypt-gabby-giffordsand-for-patience-as-malia-goes-to-her-first-dance-wit/), mandatory events like [prayer breakfasts](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/obama-hosts-easter-prayer-breakfast-with-meditation-on-suffering/2012/04/04/gIQAhW7lvS_story.html)...or when hes [trolling the GOP like he recently basically said "this is what jesus would do,"](http://money.cnn.com/2012/02/02/news/economy/obama_tax_rich_jesus/index.htm) to try and convince them to adopt his politics.

He trolls religion regularly. Its obvious. Why else do you think all the fundies are scared they would lose their privileges under him? [He even campaigned on eliminating faith-based initiatives](http://edition.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/05/obama.faith.based/) but after the backlash following his election he was forced to backtrack and reinforce the initiative with a "faith office". On top of that, don't forget him trying to get catholics to pay for birth control...  [hes trolling catholic church hospitals these days](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/17/health/policy/obama-administration-says-birth-control-mandate-applies-to-religious-groups-that-insure-themselves.html). I'm certain that even slightly religious people would have more "respect" for people of faith and their autonomy. 

Obama has supported gay-rights [WHOLEHEARTEDLY](http://realclearpolitics.blogs.time.com/2007/12/11/the_obama_questionnaire/
) since 1996 AT LEAST

No one in politics or academia believes him; Even people with different views don't believe him:

[Chris Hitchens](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITsYUjv_aEA), [Richard Dawkins](http://www.theblaze.com/stories/richard-dawkins-barack-obama-probably-is-an-atheist-lincoln-kennedy-clinton-too/), [Ann Coulter](http://www.mediaite.com/tv/ann-coulter-on-the-other-obama-rumor-hes-not-muslim-hes-an-atheist/), [Lawrence Krauss](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-Lk7gHEfK4), [Pat Buchanan](http://townhall.com/columnists/patbuchanan/2012/02/21/creators_oped/page/full/), [Franklin Graham](http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/02/21/franklin-graham-questions-obama-romney-on-christian-faith/), [Pat Roberson](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/robertson-warns-of-looming-secular-atheist-dictatorship), [Bill Maher](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/01/13/bill_mahers_campaign_prediction_obama_will_come_out_as_an_atheist.html), [Penn Jillette](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJGxVeQw3SE feature=player_embedded) etc. All of them think hes faking it. Hardcore christians and hardcore atheists.

He also campaigned on getting religion out of hiring practices: http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20082217-503544.html

He's the first president to acknowledge non-believers: http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-01-20-obama-non-believers_N.htm
 
Now you want info on Jeremiah Wright? Obama probably only distantly knew the guy. He had to more than likely only show up for appearances to make him seem like he was in touch with the community. 

Here is a point we need to talk about... Jeremiah Wright was caught saying "god damn america"...[but you really don't understand what he was getting at.](http://www.timwise.org/2008/03/of-national-lies-and-racial-amnesia-jeremiah-wright-barack-obama-and-the-audacity-of-truth/) He was saying how utterly fucked up this country has been to minorities. Its true. You can deny it all you want, but he was highlighting a truth, albeit emotionally. He just wanted to say that America should really recognize their ways if they want to embrace Obama. Its kinda that "hey, they don't like me? well damn them!" Jeremiah Wright is not racist. Not at all. But you have to remember the bias white/right-wing america feels to anyone who talks about [white priviledge](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3812249801848706206) or exposes their messed up of institutionalized racism, so of course the clip was crazy. [Obama had to throw him under the bus to move on](http://articles.cnn.com/2008-03-18/politics/obama.transcript_1_perfect-union-constitution-slavery?_s=PM:POLITICS).

Black churches are the greatest source of networking in most urban communities, especially if black leaders are known to attend. Its all a game. I know in ~~Atlanta~~ every major city with a sizable minority population that many times, elected black officials only show up to church in times of election or when they need community support. They adopt a church home only to show their relation to the community. Its all for show. They have to connect with the people some how. Thats what a "representative" (in his case Senator) does.


Name a president who says this in his inaugural speech: 

    *"We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus, and* ***nonbelievers.*** *We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth."*

He's already the negro, kenyan, socialist, communist, anti christ, who hates America.


Why throw people another bone to hate him for?

Few links outlining many inconsistencies in his "faith":

Here he is making fun clinging to guns and religion: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTxXUufI3jA


There is even a new biography that tackles his introduction to christianity and it sounds...[forced at best](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2018326327_apusobamabook.html): 

**And to cap it off, here is a section from "The Audacity of Hope". Start in the middle of p.198p.206 http://lnk.co/KPZUD . If that doesn't scream "faking it" to you, I don't know what will.**

 First of all theres no indication...NONE it causes you to be "violent"

I'm sure the 400+ years of slavery and essentially reluctance from the government to stop terrorizing black people barely 50 years ago which is barely 2 generations MIGHT have something to do with it.

Goddamn.

You can criticize a movement without feeling like you're being attacked.

Grow the hell up son.  




 Bigots like me?

LOL

I asked you to not compare the right to live, with the right to get married. 

Thats all I asked you to do.

I can't be a bigot for supporting gay marriage in all of its forms.

But you need to understand that these are completely separate issues. 




 I'm not a homophobe.

But if you can't understand how FIGHTING BEING LYNCHED and FIREBOMBED BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR BREATHING AIR is different from gays wanting to get married...then you're lost. 

I'm an agnostic-atheist and I support the rights of gays getting married.

But don't expect me to compare the two.

let gay marriage stand on its own two feet.

There are tons of non-religious people who are against the idea as well.  




 Money has nothing to do with this?

Are you serious?

You think Freddie Gray WANTED to be selling crack? 




 Why do you assume they are? I didn't say so. 




 What hypocrisy am I exhibiting when I said i'm

1. An atheist

2. Support gay rights 




 I'm. Not. Religious. 

What the hell is your problem? 

And gay marriage is NOT the same as an interracial marriage from the 1960s. 

You can't keep ignoring the whole heterosexual thing then say "its the same"

Its LITERALLY different. 

I support gays getting married, but do NOT compare what black people in the USA fought and died for with gay marriage.e

Do NOT do it.  




 They're different because interracial marriage still presumed heterosexual interaction.  


































 A running total anywhere or social media? 

It would be interesting to compare the impacts 







































 I'm legitimately serious.

I don't see any other politician right now with his track record of success or national appeal who might be able to come close within the state. 

Or Governor? 









 We can argue that he has had some questionable policies and decisions, but his personal life is pretty much as clean as you can ever ask a politician's to be.

I mean, if Obama had ever done so much as taken an extra candy bar, he'd be on the front page and barred from running for POTUS. 

Its just weird seeing the Clintons back in the ring knowing how much dirt they have on themselves.

 minimize?

hersch has done good work here, but you're acting like you learned a significant amount of information for that 10,000 word article.

Again...what changed here?

The SEALs didn't get into a massive shootout?

OBL didn't have a gun on him?

So?  




  That's a silly argument: up until very recently, "Western values" were decidedly anti-gay.

I didn't make it up

You have to understand this.

Gays and gay rights are seen as intrusions of western values and virulently opposed. You have to remember how skeptical a lot of these places are to any sort of outside influence, especially culturally at this point. ***To them***, being anti-gay is a positive aspect of their society. 


Because they've been taught to feel that. People who are raised without the hatred, who have gay couples in their lives, do not feel "viscerally uneasy" in the slightest. The idea that people are born with hatred or "disgust" for same-sex interactions is utterly absurd.

I didn't say they were or were not taught anything. I'm telling how things are in different parts of the world.

You're not going to get anywhere by just thinking hitting over the head with your value systems will work without understanding why they're so stubborn to listen to you in the first place. So yeah, a lot of straight people aren't just drawn to images of gay people "being gay"...No matter how many gay people they have in their family or interact with. This isn't even about tolerance. Its about things you see that bother you. And a lot these cultures haven't had the references to understand how to view things they disagree with without respectfully disagreeing with it. Their answer is brutal repression and not tact or tolerance. Tolerance isn't something you find in 3rd world countries who can't even find the tolerance to fix their communities and solve overarching problems.  




 It doesn't run any "counter story"

It says the government struggled coming up with the finer details they wanted to release and that pakistan may have known about the raid itself

Big whoop

This isn't even that big of a revelation...unless they said OBL died in 1999 or something 




 **Do you really not understand this?**

Step outside if the ivory tower of liberal academia and step into the real and visceral world outside of your 1st world trappings

These people just HATE gays. 

It has nothing to do with their insecurity. It has everything to do with religiosity and flat out disgust of gay people

Hell, most heterosexual people I know don't *love* gays...they tolerate them in the sense that "it doesn't bother me" and they don't want them to be persecuted. Most heterosexuals I know just generally ignore it. But that doesn't mean they enjoy watching two dudes kiss or anything. It does viscerally make people feel uneasy. But thats besides the point. 

We're talking about cultures that haven't even secure the basics yet in the modern world...that are hyper-masculine (as a function of survival) and see any threat to the masculinity and thus perceived strength of their people as an utter and vile threat to the greater good. 

This has NOTHING to do with secretly being gay.

This has NOTHING to do with being insecure with your sexuality. 

Theres a reason the world map looks like this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_by_country_or_territory

Most of the world really does not value western ideals and rejecting homosexuals is seen as tossing off the weight of "liberalism" and "secularism" in these very traditional and insular cultures and communities.

Does this mean you have to agree?

No.

But it DOES mean that you'll have to do A LOT better in coming up with quick one-word responses to anything a "homophobe" (and gays need a better word than homophobe to be honest) has to say with respect to gay rights.  




  If you define islam by its extremists, then yes, it is islam.

I can't hand you a physics book and ask you to be a *moderate* about it 




  I ask why and he tells me because it is only "gay" if you are the one receiving or fall in love with the man. 

Thats fascinating  




 Same with Russia now 




 Actually, its not.

People just actually hate gays...and they don't see it as it having no effect on their lives. They see it as something they reject and want to not have to deal with it. I'm not a homophobe or anything so this doesn't bother me, but if you don't understand how they think or why they think it, you'll forever be confused. 

There are lazy arguments about AIDS and pedophilia and general visual discomfort in viewing gays in public that pervade all anti-gay societies around the world

Not every person who hates gays craves gay sex. Its stupid to even think that.  




 Did you even read Seymour's article?

We're bickering over stuff that isn't even that big of a deal!

OK. How many people were in the room? How many bullets we're fired? Did Pakistan know or not?

Who cares?

1. A raid happened

2. Bin Laden Died

3. US Intel led up the manner

The gist of the story is still the same. 









 Honestly, these "lies" aren't even lies.

I don't even see what the big deal is 




 So? 




 Yet this hasn't even come out. So whats really the big deal?

Clearly the Seal team had some answers for us since they had a convenient accident a short time later.


SEAL Teams have hundreds of members and train all the time.  




 Actually, the details aren't even that different.

Calling it a "lie" is ridiculous.

We're just discussing the color of the tablecloth at this point 




 Fabulous  




 OR...he just hates gays. 

You gotta stop thinking people who hate gays secretly crave penis 




 **We should abandon this notion that anyone who hates gays is therefore secretly gay**.

Is it true in many cases? Absolutely.

But there is a culture within Africa and ex-colonial states around the world (partly due to colonialism) that views western social values as vestiges of oppression and colonialism and emasculation...and anti-homosexuality is seen as an effort to regain a sense of confidence and stability in society. I  have heard the arguments too ranging from "The greeks brought homosexuality to africa" and "gays keep AIDS around" and the very common "gays aren't real men"...and you have to understand that these are just people who are trying to deal with the basics in life (the average citizen) and having to then conform to these notions of gender and try to maintain a degree of tolerance while doing so is VERY difficult. 

I'm not saying its right, but you have to understand this. It goes far beyond secretly "hating yourself"  




 The same one that used to stop black progress? 




 I'm just as much a nihilist as you...but really?

You might as well criticize how money works...or anything really. 
























 Its so funny when data comes out the way you don't like it, then it must be some OTHER cause.

 Just look at some of the blog posts on there.

This guy is insane 









 You might as well just pick up some random snacks at your local drug store 




 Would him being 78 have something to do with it?

I'm sensing a bit of a Linus Pauling syndrom here... 




 *This spring I contacted Durrani and told him in detail what I had learned about the bin Laden assault from American sources: that bin Laden had been a prisoner of the ISI at the Abbottabad compound since 2006; that Kayani and Pasha knew of the raid in advance and had made sure that the two helicopters delivering the Seals to Abbottabad could cross Pakistani airspace without triggering any alarms; that the CIA did not learn of bin Ladens whereabouts by tracking his couriers, as the White House has claimed since May 2011, but from a former senior Pakistani intelligence officer who betrayed the secret in return for much of the $25 million reward offered by the US, and that, while Obama did order the raid and the Seal team did carry it out, many other aspects of the administrations account were false.*


#So whats the problem here?  














 Why wouldn't they be? Do you think the internet is just for non-government employees?

 Yes.

 Except, it didn't

Zimmerman picked a fight. 

Lost

Then shot the guy kicking his ass.  




 Lets ask Trayvon... 




 I don't understand how you look at yourself in the mirror and think zimmerman's story holds up that travyon attacked him 




 Theres no evidence he was ambushed outside of him starting whatever fight that occurred.

No teenage boy I know who is on the phone with a girl making a run to the corner store will stop to engage in fisticuffs.  




 Thug?

You mean Zimmerman? 




 This is precisely why I truly believe Trayvon did NOT start that damn fight. It makes no sense.

Yes. Zimmerman lost that fight initially and shot Trayvon...but I've never seen a situation like this before.

 Nice statistically insignificant anecdote

 Understatement 




 Do they not have any Persian art? 














 Redban. Is. An. Idiot. 




 Great Episode 









 It DID however put one suspect on probation for trying to go to a terrorist training camp 5 years ago.

You can't arrest someone with pre-crime e.g. "you're going to jail because we think you'll try and kill infidels 5 years from now" 




 Why isn't it possible for ISIS to have done this?

1. muslims get mad at mohammed pics

2. young angry muslims see whats going on online and want to join in

3. just so happens one of the suspects was being tracked by the feds for trying to go to an overseas camp.... 




 The NSA is getting so saturated with data that it's become useless for actually stopping, avoiding and lowering the essential reason it was created for: terrorism/acts of violence in America.

This isn't true.

See, predicting crime is hard unless you truly catch someone in the act. In Texas last week, the problem was that one of the suspects was already on probation essentially for being tracked to going overseas to train at a camp...but you can't arrest someone for suspicion of committing an terrorist act in the future.  




 ISIS as an islamic jihadist mindset predicates itself on worldwide domination

By asserting that they're "present" it helps them recruit.  




 How is this a conspiracy? Is it unreasonable young angry muslim men  live in the US? 









  How much would that cost?

Doesn't matter. 









 Sure 




 Ask it to tell you which planes are overhead  




 How is he wrong?

These young men aren't posting benign content to their Facebook pages.  




 Wouldn't it save us SO much more in the long run just to send a message of unity and progress and remove all of these bureaucratic barriers if we didn't have to focus on these meaningless boundaries? 




 Its SO frustrating.

ATL could AT LEAST resemble Boston. DC if we were ambitious. 

But no.

They CONTINUALLY stand in the way of literal progress in the metro area. 

This is why I suggest ATL just cannibalize everything inside 285 and be done with it.

 Yep.

FIFA is inherently almost supposed to be corrupt. You can't run something that big without it being so.

This is just a temporary reset on the grift and gives the semblance of balance so the next corruption bubble can be burst years from now.  




  Man....if this is the beginning of the end for FIFA and their corrupt ways

LOL

How naive.

You'll never have an international sports organization that isn't somewhat corrupt.

It just seems that this will be a temporary reshuffling just to give the semblance of justice

 I DO understand it.

But i'm asking if its really and truly a good idea.

Theres a lot of people in the US who I absolutely think don't either appreciate what it takes to run a nation like the US or has the balls to be assertive enough to lean on other nations in large geopolitical matters.

I partly worry that the average person is either uneducated or simply...too nice and thus, naive.

 Its well documented that Snowden et al aren't really being honest and clear with who has the documents and who has which documents and how many there are.

And they've been really cavalier with how they've managed all that data.

 Do you know what FIVE EYES is? 

Please tell me you're at least qualified to participate in this conversation 




 What world do you live in where stolen state secrets don't get people killed? 




 Greenwald doesn't know as much as he claims to know. Snowden had to teach him how to even use PGP...but now he's some sort of security expert. 

Come on now.  




 Theres no tanks rolling down the street, therefore the USA faces no threats.

See how stupid that sounds?  




 Its funny when you consider the EU spends effectively NOTHING on defense yet tries to wave their tax base around and proclaim how superior their civil society (read: government subsidy) is while the USA does all the heavy lifting.  




 Its funny that the Iranian news source is reporting this.  




 I think historically, they've shot more USA planes down than we've show down of theirs 




 Huh? How are they the idiots? 




 we have no way of knowing if these journalists are telling the truth either.

Do you not understand this?

AND GREENWALD ET ALL REVEALED EFFORTS ON INTERNATIONAL SPYING

 its not pointless when you live in a country on top...now is it.

You really don't understand what a lesser nation sees that you don't, do you?

 What world do you live in where everything is peaceful and there are no threats and on-going fights for geopolitical leverage? 




 What world do you live in where theres no threats?  




 Wikileaks is moving the goalposts.

The files are cracked and the info is gone. Why won't they just stop the charade?

This has nothing to do with Snowden...the intel is out. They keep wanting to make it about him.  




 this article has nothing to do with spying on americans 




 They burned for an hour...and planes traveling cruising speed hit them 




 Unless a jetliner traveling 400mph hits it, this thread is stupid 




 I'm not blindly patriotic. I've criticized this government more than you'll ever known...but what I'm not is naive about how many other nations would leap at the chance to use our own information against us.  




  international spying on civilian communications is out of order. If the Russian government was caught sniffing all US citizens youporn browsing habits it's be a violation of US sovereignty.

Yeah. So? 

We promote the ideas we want and shun those we don't want.

Theres no such thing as hypocrisy on the world stage

 




 Now, you're just a naive blowhard 














  The way the NSA does encryption? Yeah, it's unbreakable.

You're talking like you think snowden did this very thing. 

 




 Please, tell us more about these security standards you use that all foreign governments can crack with no effort.  




  Snowden did not take any files with him to Russia. As a teacher of Chinese counterintelligence, he knows how to keep his data safe. Neither the Chinese nor the Russians stole his data, nor did they "break the encryption", this entire story is utter nonsense and transparently so to anybody with a modicum of crypto experience.

Thats a nice cover-up to avoid the fact that they really had no tight clamp on the data that they claimed to


So Greenwald says "my files are safe"...and it turns out they're not.

So where does this leave us?  




 Did the asparagus make Putin taste bitter this time?  




  I really don't get Reddit sometimes. Failures are known, successes are not. 

PRECISELY!!! Why the hell would they advertise a victory?!? 




 Because it was a TERRIBLE metaphor and you've overplayed your hand.  




 I don't advocate dometic wiretapping. 

I advocate international spying.  




 Portugal also has no geopolitical influence around the world.  




 You haven't shown the extent of your knowledge and frankly, it doesn't matter. You don't work for the NSA and its very telling that so many people claim to be security experts until snowden showed the world how many backdoors there were into all of these "secure" communications.

So yeah, keep flaunting your credentials like your'e the next Thomas Drake or William Binney. 

You're neither. You haven't worked on those frontlines patching up the shores of the US's infrastructure. You're probably some low-level employee at Yahoo...but i'm really not interested at learning what you claim to know cause you got a BSE somewhere.  




 So you're just against any sort of power, right? 

**Because i've already admitted domestic spying is a legitimate debate...foreign intelligence is NOT up for debate.**  




 Call me a hypocrite, but I don't have any problem with the CIA infiltrating the highest ranks of every other country and using that intel to improve the welfare of the United States.

You know why?

Because everyone else does it.

And why should we lose out on that leverage and legitimacy while everyone else does?

Do you want to turn us into...portugal?  




 No. We're not

You tried to pretend that Poland has border disputes, therefore Americans can't care about their borders.

its not my problem you don't have two bodies of water on both sides of you.  




  Red herring. He's said all countries spying is bad. Repeatedly.

Too bad. He's never revealed a single Russian intelligence effort. Or chinese. Or Japanese. Or African. Or south american.

I support my country using ANY asset to gain leverage over others.

Theres a reason I don't live in Mexico.  




 The principles of THIS COUNTRY do NOT extend to everyone outside of this country. 

Period

Stop pretending every human is an american citizen.  




 Its so insulting to see people not even be capable of weighing different sources of information at the same time

If snowden says it, its law. 

Its so weird to me 




 Do you know anything about the Chinese or Soviet or Pakistani  nuclear programs? 

You all are so naive at this point 




 NSA was fine when it does international spying

Domestic spying is one thing.  




 You're waving the "programmer" card?

I'm a med student. 

Does that disqualify me from talking about anything? Cause last I checked, you weren't exactly James Bond either.

So lets get focused again.

Why do you support Chinese spying? 




 Spying doesn't work that way.

The world isn't flat and its not fair.

 




 **He could have leaked just the domestic stuff, then.**


People do NOT understand this.
 




 Whats evil?

Because I don't consider spying on non-Americans evil.

I fully support it.

I'll wait until Snowden says the Chinese doing it is bad. Because he won't.  




 I bet you believe everything coming out of Putin's mouth though.  




 I have no problem discussing domestic intelligence.

The problem is that Snowden turned the gun on his own people...and for that, I have no empathy for whatever happens to him.  




 Because:

1. Snowden didn't have to reveal foreign intel. THAT is treasonous. 
2. There are mechanisms in place to do it
3. he chose to just go rambo and he went off the reservation. 




 You're talking a big game but won't acknowledge how Poland has basically come hat-in-hand asking the US to reinforce their low-land in case Putin decides to go for a drive across the border.  




 Snowden doesn't realize the Russians and Chinese don't care about him.  




 Yeah. You're playing the game where your fingers are in your ears.  




 Its not speculation. Read the article in the Sunday times.

A member of the UK PM cabinet said the Russians and Chinese intel leaders HAVE the files.  




 Whats funny to me is that for every prevented attack, you're probably in that predictable band-wagon calling it "entrapment" or "false flags" or something else that just can't wait to steal the credit of legitimate intelligence efforts. 

And mind you, I'm a heavy contributor to /r/conspiracy...but the world is more complicated than just thinking the opposite of everything you read is therefore the truth.

Its lazy. You're lazy.  




 Or...honest? 

You seem to think the world is just full of daises and theres no importance in geopolitical intelligence

 




 I fully support the NSA/CIA knowing if any Non-American so much as brushes their teeth for 20 seconds. 

Domestically, we can argue changes...but internationally? I want the CIA to have access to any resources they can imagine.  




 I didn't think there were chances RSA was cracked...until it was revealed.

Nothing phases me anymore.

Snowden got reckless and now the US is at risk. He can't claim to just be a passive participant in this anymore.  




 But you won't DARE touch what Snowden did to internationall efforts

Whats funny about all of these leakers is that they live with (and I say this as a non-white guy) something that looks like "Western white guilt" of sorts where they're only concerned with how bad the USA is...they'll NEVER say a WORD about Russian spies or Chinese spies in American higher education 




 Whistle-blowers use official channels. They don't just reveal anything they want then say "SURPRISE! IM A WHISTLE BLOWER!"...especially when you're a government agent with top secret clearance. 

He crossed the line when he didn't stick to domestic intel.  




 I don't feel the need to EVER let up on the gas. 

This is the Great Game. 

Catch up. 




 Wow. Sounds like YOU know what snowden had.

Tell us more. What'd he eat for dinner?  




  No, it isn't clear. In fact, it's buried in so many strata of lies and bullshit, that I'm surprised anyone alive still trusts our government to tell us the truth.

Why are you so goddamn dense?

Yes. OTHER COUNTRIES ARE TRYING TO GET AT US!

Do you not acknowledge this? 


The world isn't peaches and cream and candy.

Its rough and everyone is fighting for ANY leverage possible. Stop thinking this world is safe and everyone is a good actor.  




 Flying-Bagel-Monster, forbid I have my own nuanced opinions as a 1st generation american about how geopolitics works as a citizen and what it takes to maintain the edge internationally.

Go apply for your passport, use it, and get back to me.  




 I don't agree because you're not offering any immediate practical solutions instead of holding out for ambiguous, non-specific pie in the sky bullshit. 

This sounds like a great fiction story...but this doesn't help us RIGHT NOW.

So no, keep that "border-less world" crap to yourself. Its not even relevant...and its insulting you could be that naive to even try to use that as a talking point.  




 Just show me something other than the anonymous word of a few British spooks. That's about as unreliable a source can get.


2 hours ago you didn't even know this information...and now you're asking for more

Oh really? What do you want? ANOTHER leaker? 

Stop moving the goalposts.

This is the closest you'll ever get to this confirmation. Snowden burned everyone living in the west over an ideological hang-up he has about the reality of geopolitics.  




 Snowden just betrayed every American citizen because he didn't know where to drawn the line.

He took that risk and now, he's failed.  




  Did you know that the 4th amendment constitutional protection against mass surveillance afforded to Americans... is not unique to Americans?

Thats too bad. Because I'm not really concerned how non-Americans think about intelligence. 

All human beings are entitled to this right, and to protection from the law against anyone who might violate it. And yes, they are worrying about it, all those human beings who don't live in the US.


Like hell they are. 

Each country has their own interests. All of these hifalutin poetic ramblings offer no important tangible things to discuss. Practically, this is useless. I want the USA to maintain EVERY edge necessary to stay ahead of the pack in reconnaissance and leverage economically and geopolitically...and even militarily. 

There are borders for a reason and until you understand this, you'll never learn what allegiance means.  




 The hegemony works in our favor. Not theirs. 

Remember who makes the rules.  




 I post good links. You should try.  




 I don't work for the government...but I damn well understand that geopolitics extends beyond the end of the couch in many of the basements that the narrow-sighted AnCaps  ideologues that predominate Reddit. 

 




 its in the Sunday Times 




 ***Reminder to Reddit:***

When you inevitably read something like: no evidence from the leaks of anyone being harmed 

DO NOT BELIEVE IT. They would NEVER admit to there being a direct link. 

Any intel that gets leaked, gets people killed. 

Period. 
 




  which is irrelevant to the question "should we be doing this?" and also the question "is this the right thing to do?"

I don't care if its the right thing to do or how messed up you think it is.

I WANT my government to know whats going on around the world. Domestically, we can start talking about "rights" but I don't value or even think about the rights of non-domestic citizens because they should worry about their own issues.  

 




 I don't care about foreign governments.

Do you not understand this?

They don't care about you. if you live in the US or Europe these people DO NOT value your "rights" or privacy. They never did.

Domestic spying is one thing...foreign intel leverage is another.

Snowden crossed the line when he did that. 

I support the west and western ideals.  




 Yes. Because only the US has geopolitical aims and only the USA ever does anything bad.

When you deal with classified information and governments NOTORIOUS for stealing intel, then for some reason its hard for you to believe that they'd take stolen top-secret information

You're ridiculous.

Seems you don't understand how geopolitics works.  




 Thats the same as giving them the files.

Do you not understand this? 




 Two different conversations.

And frankly, a lot of Reddit doesn't understand how geopolitics works or how power is maintained, gained, or transferred.

its not neat and its not pretty.  




 ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS REVEAL DOMESTIC SPYING.

BUT NOOOOO...HE WANTED TO GO OFF THE GODDAMN RESERVATION.

THIS. IS. TREASON.  




 I do NOT care about surveilling foreign governments or interests.

Snowden crossed the line revealing foreign surveillance.  




 There was no breach until he leaked every bit of foreign intel effort  




 He's too famous to outright kill. 




 Being "anti-government" doesn't mean you're inherently right about something. I know you're looking for easy upvotes won't come that easily. Try harder. 

Why should I believe Snowden didn't give the chinese or rusians anything? 

All of his leaks were anti-american.  




 He won't say anything. They have his stuff.  




 i'd be SUPER pissed if he did that to me 




 Wont be for another decade 
























 well put 




 they're up 2 MILLION downloads from last month

Good god Rogan 




 This is hilarious 









 Eh. 














 ITT people don't understand that Roger Ailes is the real bad-guy here 




 I fear for the welfare of any minority student she may have.

What a toxic human 




 He's not entirely wrong... 




 just got renewed for season 3 http://t.co/KuDhPE95Jx 




 Yep. And it sends the message to the populace that "something is being done" about the situation when they're all in on it.

Look at how Germany responded to the Snowden leaks. They gave enough of a show to make it seem like they cared but they really didn't.  




 Why is it so foreign to you to consider that a group of religious people CAN in theory impose restrictions on their own behavior and societal organization?

A democracy does not mean what you think it does.  




 *slow clap* 









 You. 

You get it. 









 What? 




 That assist is amazing 




 On land? or out at sea? 




 I don't even know why anyone would argue this anymore

I mean, whats the difference from a private party at someone's house and this event?

In what world do people live in where those with money, power, or both not collectively gallivant around each other? 




 anyone that believes in freedom should resist these tyrants

Huh? 




 You're a professional athlete...why is that unusual?  




 They will...gotta focus more on shoes though instead of apparel  




 Why would I *ever* accept what Natural News has to say? 




 Is this for any other boroughs? 









 He's preachy and a bit of a blowhard 









  A fundamental aspect of a democracy is having the right to protest, the right to organize freely, the right to vote, a relatively free press...

False

Thats an AMERICAN democracy

You're biased and you don't even know it

 They could have banned /r/coontown though 




 Not necessarily.

But Iran definitely has bomb components. Ask A.Q. Khan 




 Because its Boston 




 I don't know...I can't imagine Israel not sharing SOME of that info with the US 














 Democracy TECHNICALLY could result in the saudi arabia that exists.

I don't know why people confuse democracy with liberalism 














  listen to the kids threatening to kill the officer

So, you're lying now, huh? 




 They weren't tresspassing 














 Trololol 




 This video just proves the cops point.  




 Eh...guy wasn't really complying. 

Are we going to ignore this guy fighting back? 




 i bet you have 50,000 unread emails 









 How's middle school? 




 No. Watch the video. All the girls were leaving and he was cursing at them and they told him not to get so angry and as they were walking away, he pointed her out and then you saw everything unfold 









 Can you explain shortly? 




 She was walking away when he snapped.  




 Thermite! 




 you're trying to rationalize the irrational

Just accept that what Robertson said makes sense if you are religious 














 Not really it seems. I mean, if you're really religious, theres nothing wrong with that line of thinking... 





























 It wasn't a private pool party.  




 This is unreal 




 Good thing your computer opens those links for you.  




 We can judge them when they overreact  




  If they were atheists... They wouldn't have that many children and could properly take care of the ones they have so that this never would have happened.

This is why people hate atheists. 

I understand your point, its not exactly even true to a degree to make such a blanket statement 




 They would literally remove all impetus I have for using third-party apps if they made it easier to input events into the calendar.

Apps like Fantastical do a MARVELOUS job with this and I don't see whats so complicated about going ahead and doing it in house. Is such a thing patented? 

If you're not sure what I mean, look here: https://flexibits.com/fantastical-iphone 




 This isn't hate speech. 




  They are just trying their best to keep the situation under control while officer hot head is going around acting berserk. 

It only takes one.

And he's the ranking officer 




  Because they are kids, they should be allowed to bite, kick, scream, insult, steal, trespass, murder, etc without any retaliation or self defense. Because they are just kids. They get a free pass on everything. Yep, nothing illogical about that.

Thats not what happened

Its not as if people don't listen after repeated warnings to step back, get on the ground, etc. Nope, she wasn't given multiple chances to respect authority at all. He just drove up and immediately started throwing her on the ground. She totally wasn't resisting arrest at all, no sir.


She was walking away when the cop went and grabbed her


 




 Theres exactly no chance less. Pedophilia is what it is. Religiosity just tends to have a different effect on the outcome 




 She didn't. Everyone excoriated her for that.
