 Unfortunately, he is the inexperienced one in our relationship...he is not taking advantage lol. 




 It isn't just about a threesome! It's about the whole situation, the threesome Was one example. Obviously I'm not asking for advice on how to say no to a threesome,.I'm asking how to maintain such a dominant relationship! p.s. please don't patronise me due to my age! 




 I want to make him happy without making myself unhappy...I don't want a threesome, and he does. I want a negotiable solution. 




 We've been together for 6 months, nearly 7 and he is the most dominant man I've ever met. I find this hard, because I'm extremely opinionated and won't back down without a debate...it causes issues to say the least.

 He likes to be dominant in the bedroom, which I'm fine with but now is slightly pushing too much at the idea of having a threesome. It's feeling a little to pressuring and I'm not sure what to do. How to I give him what he wants, without degrading myself or ruining the relationship. Also, how do I maintain a relationship with a guy who is obsessed with threesomes!!!



   
**tl;dr**: How do I make my guy see that I'm not going to back down to his every need? He is too dominant and I'm not submissive enough.  




 She only has a single bed, whereas I have a king size. Literally the only reason 




 I'm not lol! I'm Italian heritage... 




 I stay out every weekend at my boyfriends house, and whilst I do my sibling uses my bed as her shag pad...and then I sleep in the filth without knowing. 

What are your opinions on how to stop this, or how to make it known known that it is not ok!!!!! 
























 I always struggled with not being able to touch myself! It did get worse with a full bladder, and also if I read anything or watched anything was sexual content. The ache would be there, unless I completely forgot about it by doing something else. I'd take photos of myself to please my OH and make him aroused. 

Also, cumming without touching is a very tricky skill that needs to mastered!

Good luck! 




 Elastic bands tied around the nipple for a short time, careful not to leave on for too long due to blood circulation.

Nipple suckers, try getting some suction cups and then play with them when suctioned, should be ultra sensitive. 

or if you are my adventurous, buy a milking machine and have your partner milk them! ;)  




 My partner (23 M) and I (18 F) have been together for 6 months, I am experienced with BDSM and have been for a long time, unfortunately the bdsm I experienced was mixed with abuse and so this does cause problems with kinks..My partner would like to experience things such as threesomes and having someone watch us, however I have bad experience with both of these and so am not so into trying them again. I feel by saying no, I am taking away his kink and I feel guilty for doing so. Does anyone have any advice for overcoming fears caused by bad experiences?

Thanks.  




 If you have nothing nice to say, please leave! I think the set looked lovely.  




 I didn't think there were many VS shops in UK either! 




 UK ladies, where do you buy your lingerie from? 




 Thank you, finally someone realises what I'm asking lol. :) 
























 I enter this often, and sometimes even become completely unresponsive and my partner often stops in a panic and checks I'm still ok to continue. We have safe words, and hand gestures for when I am gagged, but never feel I have to use them...but it's always best to have one just in case.  




 Well, best of luck...maybe steer clear of those conversations or just sit in and see others reactions and responses. 




 I have been doing this for a while, and started on FL. I have only bean to one munch, and realised it was not for me. I find people at munches to be a little too sociable than me and it did make me nervous. I stuck to meeting people one on one, because it was less overwhelming and I didn't feel under huge pressure. I'd say to just go to a couple, see how you feel and decide after that. A good London one to start with would be U35 weekend drinkies, or perhaps Camden crunch as they are pretty sociable and less shocking lol. 

Don't worry about not being sexually experienced, most guys and girls there are newbies looking for a bit of advice and help on the scene. However don't feel you need to become a social butterfly, just because people on this site are. Do your own thing!

Watch out for safety on FL though, such a photos with your face in (if you are concerned about your career) and also, be wary of the usual posers and fakes! Always send out and ask for a personal photo perhaps with a sign with their username by their face or something. 

Good luck!:) 




 Lines, sexual deprivation, sleep deprivation, canings, tickles :( :( 




 Taking a break is good, but also staying around friends on FL is good. Choice is yours, maybe take some 'me time' 




 You're very welcome...good luck! 




 Picture things in your mind, usually his voice is enough to set me off! Um, but mostly just really daydreaming about it! 
























 I cover my teeth with my lips, and I like to flick my tongue against the head whilst he fucks my mouth. I usually grab his bum, or play with his balls as well. 

Focus on his enjoyment more than focusing on whether you'll hurt him. If you do accidentally nip him, it won't be a complete turn off...just continue going with a little more care but don't let it put you off!  




 Ours is "watermelon"....something I'd never say randomly aloud. For slow down, we use y"yellow" however I rarely use these, and have never had to use my Safeword. 

The only time we don't use a word is if I'm gagged, we then use the key method...he puts a set of keys in my hand or my teddy paw to hold and I'll drop it if I need to stop playing.  




 Well done! That's great news :) 




 I say "you're very welcome" and it takes the sarcastic twinge off of the end, however I do sometimes Say "no worries!" Because it seems a bit more friendly :) 




 Buy some new lingerie, or something new to make me feel more feminine. Send some pictures to my OH and he makes me feel so much sexier. 

Doing my nails, or trying a new make up skill makes me feel better too   




 I'm in the same situation, I am sick of the day to day routine. Mine usually is wake up at 7:30, start work and then finish at 3ish. Then eat, bath, sleep. The only way I enjoy my days are if I'm distracted from the reality. I spend all week wishing it was the weekend, and I absolutely hate hate hate my life routine right now. In the past few months, I have been diagnosed with severe depression, and I suspect in the next week I will be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder which explains my lack of enthusiasm these days. Some days I want to just stay in bed!

The beat way to deal with it for me, was to have things to look forward too! Spending time with my boyfriend, buying a new book to read which would distract me for a while, even buying my favourite foods helped me. Don't sit around alone, and try not to think too much about why you are the way you are. Do things you enjoy, and when you feel down, go and spend time with your family, play music or even go for a walk with some music in your earphones. 

Good luck, and PM if you need any more help :) 




 Some people realise what they are when they are even younger, but may not know what the correct term is. For example, I knew I was submissive when I was younger, and most of my older partners had also known they were Dominant when they were around 16/17...It's just a feeling. 

It's similar to when a female child feels she is in the wrong body, and has the wrong gender...she knows that from a young age and although BDSM isn't as extreme as that, it still is very similar. I knew I was submissive because I naturally enjoyed having no power in the bedroom, and I hated taking lead...I prefer to be a follower :) 

  
























 Your reply was pointless.... 




 Is it that strange to want to talk about a future? Plenty of people so nowadays... 




 OH is other half...but thanks anyway  




 Make myself less depressed, and a lot more happy.  




 Yes, I like to know everything before I get myself into a deep, serious relationship. I'm not too bothered about announcing it to people, but I'd like myself and my partner to know where we are heading and if it is the right direction.  




 We've been together for longer than 3 months :) I understand how that may be annoying! 




 Other half...sorry will make it clearer 
























 Thanks so much, sorry I forgot to mention that I go to weekly therapy, and I am on my third different batch of anti depressants so already a step ahead ;) 

Thank you so much :)  




 Hi all. 

I've recently been diagnosed with depression, and am hoping to be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder which will make my condition easier to treat, and understand. However, in the process of weekly therapy, anti depressants and doctor appointments, I have lost my sex drive. I have gone from masturbating daily, to only doing it once a week or not even that. I feel I need to wear sexy lingerie to feel good about my body, and my partner constantly reassures me. 

Unfortunately, my diagnosis came around when I was a young teen after being sexually, physically and mentally abused and sometimes this effects our sex life but we have this part under control. However my partner doesn't want to feel like he's forcing me to have sex with him, although he isn't, and so sometimes he goes without sex. 

I just want some help on how to recover the drive, and spice things up a bit. Please keep in mind that this a serious post, and I'd appreciate if this was kept serious too.   




 In the shower, in my/his bed, we once tried on a wall outside his room but that was an epic fail. Lots of car sex too. 




 Truffles 




 Do you hate me for letting the vet cut off your balls? 




 I have recently been diagnosed with depression, and prescribed anti depressants. In the next weeks, myself and my SO are hoping I will finally be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, as it with really help us understand every thing better. 

In the meantime, I no longer initiate sex or anything sexual. I wear lingerie, purely because it makes me feel sexy and I find it hard to orgasm by myself. My sex drive has dropped from 100 to 30 in the space of a few months, and it is horrid for my.partner and I. 

Any suggestions on how to get back the drive, or even advice on how to spice things up a bit.  




 I cry a lot when pleasure is too much, for example when my SO pounds into me, I cry as it is too much pleasure. I cry during spankings, canings and sometimes just cry because the adrenaline has passed my body and emotions overwhelm me. Crying is my way of releasing, if I don't cry then I'm not being pushed enough. 

I've met people who giggle, or full blown laugh through scenes, not because they are ticklish but because they don't know what else to do!
