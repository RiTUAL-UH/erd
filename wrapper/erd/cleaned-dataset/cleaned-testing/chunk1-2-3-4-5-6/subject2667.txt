 I didn't see a single mention of the Seattle - Portland game on tonight, despite it being from the same family of networks in the same sport. No promotion, no commercials, nothing. Was this the same for everyone else? I live on the East Coast, so there may not have been any promotion because of that reason. Was it the same on the West Coast?

 I'd rather have Cubo Torres to be honest, although he wouldn't have fit with LA anyway (Keane and Zardes).  




 It's a different Juninho. [He's only in his mid-20s.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitor_Gomes_Pereira_J%C3%BAnior) The one you're thinking of [did have a stint in New York but is now in Brazil.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juninho_Pernambucano) 




  But you're right, I live in LA, don't follow or care about the galaxy

That's a damn shame.  




 I'll be happy if he's the next Cherundolo, personally. 




 That shouldn't be too big of an issue. Our league can pay more, is more competitive and I think has more Japanese expats centralized on the west coast, although I don't think anyone would want him on the Galaxy save for Galaxy fans.  









 Both of you guys need to flair up! 




 If the dead was an Israeli non-Arab, you'd be crying. Why are you pointing out the specs in everyone else's eyes while ignoring the stick in yours?  




 Look in the mirror and take accountability of your own actions. 




 Any journalist who comes and tries to do an objective job immediately finds their life in danger. That's why we have reporting from Beirut and Skype regarding this conflict. [Serena Shim](http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/oct/20/journalist-safety-turkey) is an example of what happens to the ones who try to do their job. 




 [Serena Shim of Press TV is also dead because of this fact.](http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/oct/20/journalist-safety-turkey) 














 Well, people in the U.S. today, whether they are authority figures or not, are more afraid of being called racist that whether their actions are motivated by racism.  




 Actually, [New York does have a Civilian Complaint Review Board.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_Complaint_Review_Board) 




 Well, is he just a temporary expat or has he immigrated for good? 




 The thing is, if you get a large enough, wealthy enough, taxpaying base moving in to an area, you'll get a more professional police force, you'll get more responsive police and you'll have an effect on the municipal government. More dollars coming in via economic activity will translate to more tax revenue.  




 Intelligence as in "mukhabarat" in this case, I think. I'm not sure on the fourth one though.  




 I laughed, although I don't think racial harmony is analogous to a failed romantic relationship.  




 How is completely separating a "let's become friends" approach? It's more like a "let's try to completely ignore each other" approach. It's almost like you're arguing for everyone to move to their native lands and for everyone to just engage in mere diplomacy. 




 Anything is better than "let's stop trying." I like how things are in the U.S. even if there is a long way to go.  




 Just like how Israelis and their apologists argue everywhere.  




 You're saying that people of different races will never get along, so we should stop trying to live near each other and cut ourselves off as soon as possible. This effectively legitimizes racism. This is the argument that white supremacist groups use today and the argument behind the segregation of old. It seems I have more faith in humanity than you do to live together with equality regardless of race. 




 You can't be racist if you don't see the other race. Brilliant!  




 Don't judge a book by its cover; don't judge an article by the headline.  




 Those areas, back then, didn't become affluent until the middle class white families moved in.  




 I don't agree with that for a second. You're effectively arguing that the only way different races can treat each other as equals is if they wall each other off. That's not an end to racism, that's an embrace of it.  




 You're kidding, right? The whole article is about racism in an Eastern European country. I've seen other stories about how people with darker skin in Eastern Europe are very fearful.  




 Buffalo doesn't get Canadian channels? I'd be surprised if they didn't.  




  OK. Let's say Spain was had underwent a complete process of Arabization and Islamization. By the 10th century the majority of people on the Iberian peninsula would be Arabic-speaking Iberian Muslims (Muwalladun), the minority actual Arabs or Berbers. Eventually the Muwalladun could have expelled their Arab overlords, but they would not have been able to reclaim their Romance languages. 

Didn't this actually happen?  




 "My brother and I against my cousin, my cousin and I against the world" 




 I'm pretty sure the Quran says there were Jews in Egypt too.  




  we're just on a break

I wonder how long the "emergency rule" will last this time.  









 Never mind that the site he posted from is actually run by Jewish people. 




 If they're in America, that will change soon on their part. Every recent immigrant takes some time to get out of their shell.  




 In the 1950s and 60s, after Jim Crow laws were repealed and schools were desegregated, many white families left cities with high black populations and left to the suburbs rather than live alongside black people or have their children go to school with black children. This, coupled with discriminatory housing laws on the books until the 1980s in some cases, has led to a de facto segregation in many areas across the United States. 

Good example of this here, if you have a half hour to spare: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp22YlJlfHo

If you look at a racial breakdown on a map of a major metropolitan area, you'll see stark differences in the racial makeup of certain areas.  









 I think America would benefit from people self-segregating less.  




 Well, he didn't even offer any evidence himself, he just made an arbitrary statement, unlike you, who actually post a link.  




 The author writes about the racism he experienced while living in Ukraine, saying that the people overall were aware of racism and eager to learn more, unlike his experiences in the United States.  









 Or if Vince didn't think he looks "ratty." 




 If he is coming here, it's going to be in LA or NY. I'm not sure he would want to come to a small town (maybe he would for the diminished attention), and the league definitely doesn't want a celebrity like that playing in a small media market.  




 No, we played Bayern Munich in Portland, how did you forget?  




 What's wrong with that?

**YO, RED BULL!** 

Glad I got your attention. You might make some of your fans happy again if you got on this. He'd be nice slotted next to Dax McCarty. Sure, your fans will still be bad about the missing Petke, but this will help put to rest the rumors about cost-cutting and shifting all of your resources to Leipzig.

 It's a slur/perjorative not just used by Daesh and Nusra, but also used by those prejudiced against Shi'i, who are also present in Iraq.

 Sometimes it causes it. And I only ever get the fish.  




 Nice backpedaling. When you use words like "savages, shithole countries, pitiful sand covered shithole, and uneducated barbaric savages," you're attacking everybody, not just the extremists, and you alienate everyone else. If someone doesn't feel like their country doesn't accept them, they'll look for acceptance elsewhere. And besides that, don't learn about religion from some news articles about tragedies. There's a billion-plus other people who don't do messed up stuff.  




 Pegida, National Front, British National Party, Party for Freedom or one of the other far-right parties in Europe? Or do you hang out on the right here in the States? Or elsewhere? Whatever the case, there's nothing you can do about immigrants or a Muslim presence. The more you ostracize them, the more you'll push them to the militants. Best to get along with them as best you can and, dare I say it, consider them your fellow citizens and natives. They will have a different color of skin than you and have different names than you. They likely will follow a different religion than you. Deal with it. Because humanity doesn't have a good track record of excluding humans because they "aren't like us."

 I can't see Jurgen being okay with a move to Qatar, or even Greece, the one time haven of Eddie Johnson and Freddy Adu. Even Russia these days is probably unfriendly to American citizens, let alone those who play for the national team.

 This is the best thing to do. While spreading cartoons may make you feel like such a great Free Speech Warrior^TM , these websites are the main recruiting and propaganda tool for these groups. One of the reasons that journalists are executed by them is that they don't see the point when they put out their own videos.  




 Two years ago, [Petke] made a birthday video for my seven year old son wishing him a happy birthday and telling him to keep practicing playing soccer and maybe one day, he would play for him, Ader recalls. Talk about youth development! To have the coach who the kids watch every game say something like that  it really changed his life. Now he is nine and playing soccer everyday, five days a week. I know that role model was key part of it. I am forever grateful to that and for that.


Why did they fire Petke again?

 **Submission Statement:**

The article by Teju Cole looks at some of the underlying issues behind the Charlie Hebdo attacks, including the magazine's history of provocation on ethnic, religious and racial lines. It also points out double standards on the deaths of innocents in other places, as well as on free speech itself.  














   Contrary to outsiders view of Israeli society Israelis actually don't particularly like military campaigns because it means calling on the reserves. 

Does not compute with what you just said.  




 In the first few games called up under Klinsmann, he played really well. Assisted on two goals in two different games against Mexico. Perhaps Klinsmann thinks he can still build on that.  




 Set up the goal in Klinsmann's first game in charge, set up the goal in our first victory in Mexico... yup pretty good track record.

Of the three players involved in that first goal (**EDIT**: changed from game) under Klinsmann (Agudelo, Shea and Rogers), only Shea is left standing, oddly.  




 Andrew Wooten is an American who is playing far better in the 2.Bundesliga.  




 Maybe he's going with a five man backline and wants D-Mid type CBs.  




 What's wrong with him playing for Canada? We've stolen quite a few already (looks like Akindele too) from them, so if they get one or two to switch from the U.S., I'm not going to stress.  




 Why is it that every military campaign has something like 80-90 percent approval among the Israeli public?  




 Nobody ever really had anything bad to say about him from that team.

 At a time when Klinsmann is apparently recommending that young players go overseas, this does not bode well for the league keeping the talent developed in its academies.

 Start with two through four in that order, and don't limit yourself when it comes to Islamic scholars. Sunni, Shia, etc. all should be explored. You'll have some issues if you don't know Arabic and Farsi for this, as translated works aren't as widespread as they should be.  

However, most of the world's Muslims don't speak these languages (part of the reason is a lack of education), yet they still understand many concepts both basic and not so basic. Most of the world's extremists either haven't read up or have merely seen the most extreme of sources.

After you've learned a bit from scholars and scripture, you'll be able to get a better picture of what's wrong with extremists. At least I hope so.  




 That is some of the most severe right wing propaganda that I have ever read. You're taking some kind social media activism as some kind of organized campaign by the radical left, when really it's slacktivism at worst and legitimate activism as best. Your hatred seems to be directed at "social justice," as well as any sort of left leaning ideology. 

They work hand in glove with race-baiters and use ridiculous theories to convince the uneducated that somehow someone else is responsible for their lot in life. They promote debunked Marxist and Communist economics and politics as solutions for the 'injustice' of our society. They erroneously believe confiscation and redistribution of wealth by the government (with special groups like themselves getting a cut) will solve critical fundamental flaws actually caused by poor quality education and the effective dissolution of families, particularly in the black community. And they use every opportunity to shout down anyone who disagrees with them, usually by playing the race card. Assault, defamation, harassment, innuendo, libel and lies, rumor, slander, threats and violence are their tools of the trade - manipulation of the uneducated masses to accede to their wishes (money and power) is their goal.

My God, it's like I'm reading a tea-party manifesto. 

 SJW, race-baiters, and environmentalists are really nothing more than shakedown artists. They vampire ludicrous amounts of resources but contribute nothing positive to society, and are deserving of all the derision and ridicule they get, IMHO.

Yeah, I'm going to just call you a far-right extremist. That's enough internet for me today.  




 You're completely wrong. The majority of Muslims don't act like animals. Just look at the UK, where most Muslims are fine. France has five million Muslims, the most in Europe, and this is the first terrorist attack of its kind. 

I'm just glad I live in the United States. At least the bigots don't make like difficult for us here, and we tend to be successful. In Europe, we're shoved into ghettos and poverty.  




 What's wrong with that?  




 I think the term's use as an insult is idiotic. The irony of someone campaigning for the internet would be a "warrior" coupled with the fact that they are doing so for a good cause (social justice) and the fact that some people think that's worthy of derision.  




 I've seen dozens of names both cultural and religious, from both Pakistanis, Arabs, Iranians, Afghans, etc. Perhaps it's just where you're at.  




 My whole argument is that Islam teaches NOT to kill people just for having different opinions. This isn't berating, this is arguing. I apologize if you think that's what it is. I don't know if I can convince you of that. Perhaps I can't, but I had to try. Please don't hold prejudice or violence in your heart against Islam. Muslims are full of flaws, but the ones responsible for the attack went beyond the bounds of Islam. That's all that I wanted to say.  




 No, you misunderstand. "The entire religion" doesn't subscribe to one belief because there's no central authority. His ideas are perfectly valid, and I agree. But there's a written tradition from one of the Prophet's descendants: "Don't judge the religion by its followers. Judge the followers by the religion."  




  why issue fatwas on everything disagreeable

This doesn't make sense. Avoid rulings on controversial topics?  




 It just basically said making the cartoons depicting his face or insulting him isn't allowed. It didn't come with any kind of penalty.  




 TIL my religion is apparently defined by polls.  




 There's no central leadership in Islam. So that's not valid.  




 Ironically, they are killing Muslims. 




 Reading a few news articles doesn't mean you know my religion.  




 You haven't met that many Muslims, have you? 




 Beliefs based on faith are not irrational, saying stuff like that pisses off the majority of people of faith, normal or extreme, Muslim, Christian or whatever.  




 Ah yes, even when we condemn it, we're lying! I don't care what you think. I know very well what Islam teaches, having been raised in it, and I and most other Muslims know this is wrong, and you don't get to tell me what I "actually" believe. 




 Hey, you used to have Red Bulls flair...

 [You could not be more wrong.](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/14/are-all-terrorists-muslims-it-s-not-even-close.html) 




 In Urban areas, racial diversity is normal, so it is a lot less common. That doesn't mean it never happens, but you'll have more people jumping to your defense.  




 The military doesn't realize that serving in a country's military is a big part of Sikh culture, and that the soldier will be extremely professional.  




 Even if he was a Muslim it wouldn't be okay.  









  Muslims are allowed to eat meat from Christians and Jews. 

Sorry, this isn't agreed upon by all Muslims. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhabihah 




 Fun fact: Chilean Sea Bass isn't really ["sea bass."](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patagonian_toothfish) 




 Uhh, you forgot Mickie James. Maryse wasn't bad either.   




 Not Arab, but Muslim. I stick to seafood or vegetarian if meat isn't halal.  




 Do you ever get fish?  









 I take it this is for stoppage time?  




 YES, YOU CAN, GET A FLAIR LIKE I HAVE 




 HEY, DO WHAT I DO OR FIND SOME VINTAGE CREST 




 TWO OF DC'S STARTERS WERE HURT YESTERDAY. 




 DORITOS 




 Look at this hipster following the AFC Champions League. /s 




 Does the group plead the FIF?

1,2,3,4, FIF! 




 Their pro-rel is kind of a joke. Rich teams that were relegated were buying the licenses of promoted teams so they could stay up.  




 Ok feud with CM Punk that had Punk creepily singing happy birthday to Rey's adorable daughter.  




 He should've gotten a retirement match or sendoff, though.  




 Where did Styles go?  




  Mysterio vs. Fenix and Mysterio vs. Drago
 

Mysterio vs. Johnny Mundo (Morrison)! A match we never got in WWE (at least not that I remember) that would be amazing.  




 You think Gaddis is better? Maybe defensively, but I don't think you remember the Williams from a couple of years ago.  




 Well, we'll see if RBNY can win any playoff competition anytime soon.  




 Wow, good that he's doing that again! When healthy, he really helps the offense and is one of the top RBs in the league.  




 What are those, comment flairs for ants? They should be like, five times bigger.  




 Who made the cross? Well aimed.  




 Except when the CCL rolls around (at least until an MLS team wins it).  




 For those of you who don't get it, he's talking about the Brooklyn Italians. 




 Not according to the UN and most of international community.  




 How much time do you have? Zack Ryder. Christian. Cesaro. Big E. Kofi Kingston. Titus O'Neill. Tyson Kidd. Sin Cara. Every diva who can wrestle and act convincingly.  




 Uh oh, that sounds like union talk! Better get the scabs!  




 Username is great here.  









 I agree completely. It's why I don't have an MLS team yet. I've never lived anywhere with one, and don't identify with the team closest to my hometown (in MD, close to Baltimore, but the closest MLS team is Philly). 














 There are like eight teams in London though! And Fulham has a reputation for signing Americans, and now has an American owner. 




 Grammar is usually worse when people type from their phones. I have to know correct grammar for my job. I don't correct people, but when you try to call people out for it (even if it is sarcastic), I HAD to do it.  




 Didn't capitalize Man or I, spotlight is one word, grammar is spelled with two A's, shorthand is usually one word.  




 How do I become clear?  









 Who is yersel and why should I be thinking for him? 




 Salaam my Arab brother! Christian? Atheist? Jewish? 




 "You Winchesters are idjits!" 




 Whoever was downvoting this earlier is stupid. That's how you respond to "takbir," for one, so it's not unexpected. Second, every Muslim says Allahu Akbar, not just extremists.  




 But then you'd be rooting for financial groups, mate. 









 OP is whining.  




 Yeah, I think he slipped in that joke.  




 It's been there for eight hours. It's also on /r/videos. 




 Hence why he said "worse-kept secret." 




  Felix Magath's farther 

I take it his closer was German?  




 On  a related note, here's this: http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/02/17/its-hard-to-prove-any-hate-crime-but-for-muslim-victims-its-especially-tough/?hpid=z10 




 Your posterior had better contact someone at once! 




 Hey Garber and the players' union, are you listening? The mental health of these people is at stake! 




 [The FBI thinks there's enough evidence to open an investigation of their own, and have seized the man's computer, a camera and three phones.](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/14/us/fbi-inquiry-muslim-student-killings-chapel-hill-north-carolina.html) 




 Terrorism knows no race or religion.  




 Why can't Muslims be rogue idiots with mental problems? Are they always part of a greater movement?  




 In America and England, those are areas of crime, not "Shariah zones" or some BS.  




 Biden's son Beau served overseas, even though he was Attorney General of Delaware at the time.  




 Neither was a hate crime? Yeah, ok. Who says atheists can't be right wing, anyway? We don't know (**EDIT: changed from now) about his political views. 

And you found one supposed false accusation, never mind that there's no web link. Congratulations. 

We have politicians like Bobby Jindal claiming there are no-go zones when that has been debunked. We have people frothing at the mouth when you don't call terrorism "Islamic" or "Muslim," never mind that most of the victims are Muslims, and we have people claiming that Muslims don't condemn terrorism. As Chris Christie put it, "I'm tired of dealing with the crazies."  




 American Muslims have a rational fear of right wing bigotry and terrorism, like what we just saw in Chapel Hill and Houston. A fear of Muslims and Islam is irrational.  









 You just made some Cosmos official's day. 









 Yes, I think that's how it works. 









 DC's is, or so I've heard. 




 U-20s I believe, and he played in competitive matches.  














 The few that have (I'm talking like three or four) probably have come back to the U.S.  




 That was confirmed actually. He's with Uruguay now.  




 As long as it isn't pay to play. Kids with rich parents in the suburbs won't benefit from this as much as talented kids from the other side of the tracks who can't afford the expensive club teams. 














 Hopefully Ventura Alvarado and Cesar Romero.  




 Someone RES tag him! 




 The Hansel of the US soccer pyramid.

 I'm picturing two four-year-olds arguing about this and it's adorable.  




 [CONCACAF Champions League.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF_Champions_League) 




 Yeah same with me. 




 I saw one chilling at my hotel in Texas a few years ago.  




 You should use "In Latvia no potato, only pain." 




 He sounds like a keeper. 




 I don't know. Is Bork sensitive about his girl pop love? 




 Bork seems to be into a lot of girl pop for some reason.  




 BORK CAME IN LIKE WREAKING BALLLLLLLLL 




 In the preseason so far, Edu is playing D-Mid, with the Portuguese-Canadian guy on loan and Ethan White holding down the CB spots.  




 **Submission Statement**

The Detroit man who was fortunate enough to get donations after his story of walking 20 miles a day to work went viral now has a host of problems to deal with, as he appears to be wealthy in his impoverished neighborhood and now wears a metaphorical target on  his back.  









 I'm not even a fan of Indy Eleven and I want it.  









 Yeah, I read about it in that article by Brian Sciaretta the other week. Sure, the Armenian league isn't all that great, but if Ibarra can get called up, Romero should too. Mexico also has to be noticing his play at this point as media attention increases.  




 Cesar Romero is running away with the Armenian league golden boot. He needs to get called up too.  




 It was good news for Americans, who make up a majority of this subreddit. It also was the catalyst for the creation of MLS.  




 When the '94 World Cup was announced?  




 So, anybody want an older Rapids jersey. It's 2XL and has been sitting in my closet for a while. I bought it from Ross and it still has the tags. I've been too lazy to post to /r/kitswap (I'll do it eventually). Does anyone here want to save me the trouble?  




 He's a Twellman-Holden hybrid.  




 That's what supporters of Bashar say too.  




 You were hoping he had relations with a corpse?  




 Woo woo woo, you know it! 









 And that's why you're an NYC fan.  




 It's a play on grassroots. Grassroots means an effort that began organically, from the ground up. Astroturf is fake grass, so astroturfing is a fake version of grassroots. 
 




 I'm referring to the previous "reform" candidate Mohammed bin Hammam, who has since been banned from FIFA.  









 Government propaganda can be hazardous to one's mental health.  




 What about that Mecca-Madinah railway?  




 Only in that it is one year afterward... 




 Why are all the reform candidates members of Arab royal families?  




 Autocorrect has ruined me. 




 I always thought a good gimmick would for someone to buy into his philosophy, start Bo-lieving and then suddenly win their matches with Bo's help. Someone like Zack Ryder would be perfect. He could wear a white suit, have a combed haircut and start spouting off how terrible he was before he met Bo and started bolieving. They could do that victory lap holding each other's arms high. 

**EDIT:** Suit not suite. He can't wear a nice hotel room. It's also spelled "bo-lieve."

 It's sad that you only see those two options. Tunisia seems to be doing well.
 




 [Reverse Racism lol](http://youtu.be/SoG4pNWUVZw) 




 OK, Jerry. 




 HATERS GONNA HATE HATE HATE

BORK SHAKE IT OFF 




 Hur durr they're Arab cuz they wear turbans. OP is a   




 I'll talk shit on any unelected king, bro, when they make the news. I have issues with leaders who aren't accountable.  




 You have Arab immigrants too, don't forget them! 




 In your case, probably Israels.  




 He's an unelected king with near-absolute control. I think that's why he's being denigrated.

 









 On a related note, what happened to Conor Doyle? He got minutes a couple of seasons ago but rode the pine last year.  




 entire political party bigoted is very much a personal attack

I fail to see the logic in this. 

 




 He's a mod for /r/PalsbaraInAction, so JIDF probably isn't far off. **EDIT**:Just checked, he isn't and I got him confused with another user. Still posts too much though.  




 Then hummus is biddah, because the clearly the chickpeas are taken from the plant, mashed, and deliciously flavored... 




 /r/im14andthisisfunny 









 They certainly are, but I'm not less of an American for disagreeing with them.  




 How much of it is him and not being egged on by the producers?  




  If you don't like democracy, YOU can be the one to GTFO. 

Thankfully, there's a first amendment that protects people regardless of their political opinions.  




 /u/sematrix is a bit prejudiced against Jews and Judaism. He posts ok stuff, but discredits those of us who criticize Israel because we are opposed to injustice, not because we don't like Jews or Judaism.  




 I like the post, but I don't like semantics or the poster...oh right, sematrix.  




 I think they're setting up a face Orton - heel Rollins matchup at Wrestlemania, hence the Orton bashing.  




 I'll give you Putin and their laws, but supporting Russia and Russian culture does not make someone a heel, it just makes them proud of their country. Making someone pledge allegiance to another country against their will is a heel move.  



















 Are we sure if this is satire or not? 




 Oh, I wasn't referring to 2003. Back then, Syria was internally ok, relatively speaking.  




 You forgot Bahrain, which brutally crushed its own Arab Spring (all but dead unless you live in Tunisia) uprising.  




 Plenty of Syria refugees are in Jordan as well.  




 Replace the mentions of trolling in the article with harassment, and it's still a good article.  




 Yeah, I noticed that too, hence my comment. 




 /u/Ingens_Testibus's post or mine?  




 Something tells me there is hair on your neck and a fedora on your head.  




 Emegharad! DP! 




 Does that make [Juan Cena](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wKClxSRsg0) El Generico?  




 You mean people can't see him?  




 He must not know much about Intercourse.  




 Up here, /u/mattnox, up here.  




 It was temporary, and I'm back. Terrorism is wrong, everybody, even when it's to advance the game of soccer.  




 Still cringeworthy sometimes. "They wants me to be a good R-Truth!" 




 Should've given him Paul Heyman as a mouthpiece. 




 He forgot all of the Germericans.  




 The more money we come across the more problems we see... 




 YOU MUST BE NEW HERE.  




 Squeeze your nose for a few seconds and then let go. You'll instantly smell the inside of your nose. I'm serious, try it. Usually it's something you recently ate.  




 If terrorists attacked an MLS game it would instantly become the most popular sport in America. 


Ok, I just had an evil thought and should probably take a break from Reddit for a while.  




 You sons of a silly person! 




 And what is your team, unflaired one?  




 He's a returning MLS player, though, so aside from the USMNT he still goes through allocation.  




 I guess everyone's ditching the existing USL Pro teams and making their own? Seems like the Kickers and others are chopped liver.  




 Turmeric, red pepper, and a beaten egg. It tastes very good.  




 He was there when he was called up, and in all honesty he's not likely to be sticking around. 









 Nobody with national team caps should sign with an NASL team, at least not for a while. Freddy is better than that.  




 You're getting Freddy Adu and you will like it!  




 As noted earlier, it would take a DP spot to do that.  




 Crazy, isn't it? I never believed the rumors, as I don't even think he looks that old.  




 I would think so. Although, so many teams would pass on him that it may render the process irrelevant.  




 Freddy Adu?  




 You can't forget tipping the fedora.  




 Also, look at working at the sports department of a mid-sized or small newspaper. Resume building can help out when another media outlet has a soccer reporter opening. Sure, you'll have to cover other stuff, but you'll get experience.  




 You do realize having him last until the final four IS booking him differently, right? Careers can be made out of nowhere with a good rumble showing.  




 I'm a journalist, but not a sports journalist. That being said, freelance and look for a job at the same time. If anything, you'll be building up credibility to help you find a soccer journalism job. 

In the meantime, do a ton of online searching. MLSSoccer.com, journalismjobs.com and even just plain Google will work.  









 You're right and shouldn't be downvoted. There's never been a foreign face WWE champion and I think that's why.  




 Yeah, you're being the bigger man here.  




 He had better options in the fall, with Werder Bremen and apparently some  Eredivisie teams interested. Heck, if he stayed with Utrecht, he'd be playing with Rubin right now, which would be a sick combination.
