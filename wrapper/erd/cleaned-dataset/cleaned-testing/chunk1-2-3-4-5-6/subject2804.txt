 Nothing will keep multipools from mining profitable coins 




 Yup that's a thing 




 They already did at the 1.6 fork/update. It's called digishield and the digibyte guys helped with it. 

The reason multipools are still mining doge is because of the profitability.  




 Sounds like a plan 




 Um hmm 




 I'm a little disappointed. I asked another shibe to post him on his 'roo and he didn't. Now you post without your 'roo. I'm starting to think all my geometry classes and books were wrong about the land down Under

 What's his reddit name?  




 You need encouragement? Did you put a little too much money into dogecoin than you could afford? 

Dogecoin has been around since December (as have I) and so much has been accomplished! The water wells, Jamaican bobsled team, save them hood, Nascar. The community is always positive and has grown to almost the size of btc. For dogecoin to go away it would mean that no one mines anymore and there are no more merchants to accept it and no longer has volume on exchanges. I don't see that happening anytime 




 That logo was created by /u/theprophet84 about a month ago. looks like he hasn't been online in 3 weeks

 Im thinking 3 wallets. Mobile, pc, and my pc. Just to be safe 




 Stop using the drive if possible. Load it into another pc and run recovery software like "Recuva" looking for any *.key files (I believe that's the wallet from multidoge) 
























 I invented the time machine to go back in time to introduce my grandparents to each other. They had sex and my parents were born. Then I introduced my parents to each other and they had sex. Then I was born. I learned to read at age 2, got my PHD by age 5, and became the president of the united states by age 7 1/2 just to updank this. 




 Not full on archealogy, but amateur hunting. There are a few places near me where you can pick fossils up from the surface. No shovel required. It's a great way to burn off some extra calories walking all day, being outside. And the feeling when you find something, is amazing.

 At first it was hard work. The stressful days and long long hours into the nights. Many times I thought of quitting and going back to my 9-5 desk job and begging my boss for mercy and maybe a raise so I could family. 

But then I meet this beautiful woman who seemed to have a plan. 

She started out by telling me her 3 step process. 1) Find an investor. You need a money backer to get supplies. 2) Find a good location to do business. 3) 50. It was about that time I realized she was a 50 ft tall towering creature from the mesopotamic Era asking for money! I said "get out of here you god damn loch Ness monster! "

TL;DR: Location location location
