 That was confusing 




 Your tramp of an aunt 




 Most people are disgusting creatures who don't wash their hands after touching their junk. Sad, but true. 




 I apologize for all the nice folks in the USA. I've always encouraged my friends to be mean to foreigners. We are still working on it, but hopefully we will have everything in order by the time you visit. Have a lovely day...asshole ;) 




 Shut up Seahawks fan

 The Lost pilot is pretty captivating 




 I showed up to my construction site early one day and found this guy that would hang around the site all the time named Vito blowing a guy. Found out later that he got killed in a terrible way. 




 That's a crappy situation 




 Did the Ginger make it? 




 I was at a party in college drinking and having a good time when a few kids came over that were looking for some trouble. We were out on the front lawn asking their group to move onto the next party and stop causing trouble and they were getting more and more riled up. My buddy put his hand onto one of them to ask them to move down the block when another kid suckerpunched my friend and knocked him out. He immediately took off running, as we gave chase, and he started to run across the street. Right as my buddy grabbed the back of his shirt, the kid got plowed into by a car.

It was a grisly scene. The kid was hit so hard that he went through the car window. He was slumped over the steering wheel of the car and the driver was sitting there motionless with a look I will never forget. The kid's leg was backward and his bone was sticking out of his leg. He was unconscious for a while and we called the cops to send an ambulance as quickly as possible. He woke up after a while and started screaming in pain and trying to pull himself out of the windshield. He was cutting his hands up real bad and a few of us had to restrain him from hurting himself any further. 

Several cops, ambulances, and firetrucks showed up and eventually he was removed from the windshield and taken to the hospital. The car was going 32 MPH according to the police after they measured the skid marks from the car's brakes. The dean of student affairs interviewed me a few times about what happened and told me that the kid had numerous broken bones including the compound fracture of his leg, internal bleeding, a major concussion and needed over 400 stitches. My buddy that grabbed his shirt had to get glass removed from his hand and needed several stitches. The good news is that the kid recovered and returned to school after a few months. I will never forget the whole experience, it was such an intense situation. In a flash of time, a kid's life could have ended, but he luckily was spared. We were obviously pissed at the kid for hitting my friend, but I would never wish that on anyone. 

**TL;DR:** A kid suckerpunched my friend, ran into the street and got hit by a car and ended up halfway through a windshield of a car with terrible injuries. 




 Cough....bullshit....cough 




 Can you tell that story again, but in English this time? 




 That's a really shitty situation

 That was a crappy joke 




 And where could we find this porn?

 On August 7th, 2007 I happened to be lucky enough to be offered to throw out the first pitch of a San Francisco Giants game, as part of Italian Heritage Night. My family booked the biggest block of group tickets and so the Giants ticket office gave us the opportunity to throw out the first pitch and my family chose me. Barry Bonds ended up breaking Hank Aaron's home run record that night when he hit his 756th home run. I ended up getting him to sign the baseball after the game. The ball has my name, the date and the Giants logo monogrammed on it.  




 What a dingleberry move on your part! 




 Phil....Phil Connors? 




 Zero fucks were given that day 




 My cheeks get flushed and sweaty when I eat green apples. I never really noticed that this was unusual until I was wiping some perspiration off my cheeks and my girlfriend asked me why my face was so red. I told her about it and said that I thought this happened to everyone when they ate tart things. She laughed at me, called me weird and assured me that this was not normal. Am I dying? Is this a actual medical affliction? 





























 Your username leads me to believe this story might not be truthful... 




 Whisky also does the job quite well

 That most of the people in the Reddit community were intelligent, contributing members of society. Some of you should never procreate. This topic has me in stitches...(just to clarify- that means I am laughing uncontrollably haha) 




 I always thought it would be really cool if they rebooted the series with a new Entourage. It could center around a young, upcoming rapper and his entourage. It could have some of the same players (Ari Gold, Billy Walsh, etc) but have a fresh new feeling to it with an all-new cast of characters. I would have loved to see something like that. 




 Maybe a 5 or a 6, I just have seen every episode and picked up on it part of the way through reading your well-written post. Funny stuff. 




 Smoke more weed Turtle

 Thank God I won't have to hear from this turd burglar anymore. I fucking hate this guy. 




 Godspeed my friend. Happy NYE. I will hit my Roor in your honor! 




 I haven't seen the interviews. I'll check them out!

Was hoping for some juicy stories from high school.

 Even before reading this article, I found this ass clown to be one of the most despicable, entitled losers in Hollywood. This just confirms his douchiness for me. Suck it LaDouche.

 There would be nothing funny about me seeing those clowns, because I would be sitting in a pile of crap. The poop would definitely be of the nervous variety. 




 Haha I was only kidding. No hard feelings. 




 That is tragic. Sorry for your loss. 




 Sorry for your loss 




 I just threw up in my mouth

 Easily the best shootout scene of all time! 

My buddy was over my house the other day and saw the DVD laying out and told me he has never seen it and asked me if it was any good...

I told him he wasn't going anywhere for the next 170 minutes. He was not disappointed. 

 




 When the Grandma entered the room, I thought the Grandpa was going to tell Ethan to leave the room and stop cockblocking him.

 I recommend a surveillance system and a trained attack dog. Good luck, you'll get him and then you will have your life back. 




 Haha a diarrhea bubble is interesting to you? 
























 Sounds painful 




 I have a hunch that he didn't throw for another touchdown that game haha. 




 Holy shit dude! 




 Tearing your achilles sounds like a terrible injury. 




 Glad your friend was ok. A friend of mine got hit in the throat in a lacrosse game a few years back. He took a pretty hard shot (80-90 mph) right in the trachea and had to go to the hospital, but he also ended up being okay. Just some trouble breathing for a few days.  




 That is an absolute nightmare 




 That is tragic 




 Please share your stories of terrible injuries you have seen during a sporting event, either while on the field or in the stands. I know you Redditors have seen some crazy things before, shock me! 




 Do you paint your eyebrows on?

 I have a Bernese Mountain dog and when I take it to the park people will always comment, "That's a nice looking Burmese." For some reason, it always get under my skin. 




 Can confirm, am the Devil. 




 I never let it touch the ground. I was very careful about that. That is no joking matter, I take that very seriously. 









 You sir, are a badass! Have an upvote.

 Finnerty's is the place to go in NYC! 









 The Kardashians 




 I'm not sure who to believe on this post. However, you posted a well thought out, seemingly informative and reasonable post that seems to be from a level of experience. Most posts in Reddit claim to be from someone in that field, when you can sometimes tell the person is just trying to make something up to sound smart or for karma. You are the only post in here on the other side of things, but you don't have that armchair professional air to your rhetoric. I can appreciate that. Have an upvote. 




 Aesop Rock is a musical genius 




 USA USA USA!!! 




 Looks like the skeleton from Tales from the Crypt! 




 Such wow! 




 Looks more like a leopard. 




 But first, lemme take a selfie! 




 I couldn't care less about whether I get upvotes or downvotes. I dislike when people try to put words in my mouth. You are drawing some wild conclusions. You continue to try to infer things from my posts that couldn't be further from the truth. You are free to try to interpret my anti-terrorism rhetoric however you deem necessary. After all, it is a free country! 




 You are a complete idiot Cyan. I am of the belief that if you are responsible for a terrorist attack on the United States of America, you should be taken down with swift vengeance. I made no references to the power granted to the NSA or condoned the intrusion of people's basic civil liberties. I would have never guessed in a million years that I would be downvoted for condemning terrorism. Pretty disgusted with this thread right now! 




 I hope we take down any other fuckers involved with the Boston Marathon bombing. You fuck with the bull, you get the horns!

 This same theory applies to most unpopular kids who join a frat in college in order to be "cool" in the eyes of their peers. 




 I had to tell them I was suspended for 2 weeks from 8th grade because a classmate snitched on me for having weed at school. Snitches get stitches!

 I opened the comments to say that same exact thing hahah. You beat me to it. Well done! 




 48 feet long? Holy shit! 




 Duuuude, that would be hilarious. 




 Haha! 




 Now now fellas. Asdyc, what is your favorite dinosaur? 




 It's not about wrong or right, it's all a matter of opinion. Interested to hear what dinosaur you think is the most badass. 




 Those things are like the hyenas of the dinosaur world. 




 What about the Gigantosauras? 




 Hahaha the Megalodon must have been frightening beyond comprehension for everything else in the ocean! 




 Pterodactyls were absolute death from above! 




 What that real? 




 What was the fiercest dinosaur in your opinion? 




 That was an awesome link. I didn't even know about the Gigantosauras. That dinosaur sounds fierce as hell! 




 Mammoths were pretty huge! You wouldn't want to catch their horns. 




 What was the most badass dinosaur in your opinion? 




 Haha dodo birds! 




 That's one huge bird! I bet it had some serious talons. 




 I was watching Cosmos tonight and it made me wonder what was the most interesting/badass animal to ever inhabit Earth? 




 Well that hit me right in the feels!

 We have all had to endure long lines, layovers and the TSA but what is the craziest thing you have ever seen at an airport? I know you Redditors have some great stories to tell. Please share! 




 That's a tough break...

 I've found myself in awkward conversations before and wanted Reddit's advice on how to politely walk away without seeming abrubt or rude. 




 You've uncovered an ancient oreo! 




 Don't have enough upvotes to give! 




 You hit the nail on the head. It's the Seahawks fan who still have the price tags on their jerseys. There are a lot of them out there and they don't know how to be proper fans, so they resort to being internet trolls. Not a good look! 




 Welcome to the club my friend!

 He's blocked me on 3 different Twitter accounts. He is the ultimate hack. He flings mud against the wall and sees what will stick. If you question him or disagree with him on Twitter he will block you. You can't be a total fear mongerer and then be a big pansy when people call you out on your shit... 




 I came here to say just that, glad you have the top comment!  




 Love it, my Berner thinks he's a lapdog too and he's 105 pounds. Bernese mountain dogs are the best dogs on the planet! 




 Because living 




 Is OP Rob Gronkowski? 




 Foxy 




 RIP Oscar, Giants fans all over are sending positive thoughts to your family in this tough time. 




 Cute pup! 




 Awesome picture my friend! 




 Beautiful San Francisco? 




 Ya but as we saw last week, the Rams seem to run out of steam in the second half. I personally hope that this is the beginning of a long unraveling for the Seahawks. 




 My buddy ran into them at Best Buy tonight. They must have been going on quite the shopping spree! 




 There was a runner on first and the ball got by AJ. Since the runner would advance on the passed ball, he flopped on Ishikawi's backswing lightly grazing him so that the runner couldn't advance. 

TL;DR: AJ Pierzynski is an assclown 




 Fuck that fucking guy!

 Shut your commie mouth! 




 True American Patriot! 




 Let's get rid of him!!! We were so much better under Singletary... 




 The Sticky Bandit strikes again! 




 My dog ate one of my fiance's socks and had to have 4 feet of his intestines removed. He has a bit of a sensitive stomach now, but he doesn't eat socks anymore.  




 I have a Bernese Mountain dog and he is the most gentle dog on the planet. He thinks he is a lap dog, despite being 105 pounds. Also, he is so sweet and gentle with children and other dogs. He is simply the best! 




 Epic photobomb! 




 What is your dog's name? My bernese loves to dig holes too. He gets so dirty though haha. 




 That's incredible! I would love for Cooper to live to 14. I walk him frequently and shower him with love. He is simply the best! 




 They have a high likelihood of cancer and joint problems. Mine is 5 and healthy as can be. I hope he lives forever, that would be ideal! 




 My berner loves to snuggle! He always cries until you give him some form of physical contact. Big old dogs that are extremely gentle and loving. 




 My cheeks sweat when I eat green apples. It's pretty weird and I've never heard of that happening to anyone else. 




 Berners are the cutest puppies. I have a 5 year old Berner and I always melt when I look back at pictures of him as a puppy. 




 "Omar don't scare." 




 Replying so I can listen to this later 




 Did nobody else get the reference? It's even more clear when you look at OP's username haha. Well done Costanza! 




 I feel bad for those poor husbands 




 Touch sir 




 You wear a condom when you have sex with your wife?  




 Ya we should probably set that up. Put him on a leash and drag and kick him around like he did to his puppy. 




 Everyone should join me in signing this petition to get this dirtbag fired. There is no place for animal cruelty like this. As a dogowner, that video made me sick to my stomach. Please participate!

 Ate one of my fiance's socks as a puppy. He had to had 4 feet of his intestines removed. He's been an expensive dog so far, but he is the sweetest dumb dog ever.

 It woke both my girlfriend and me up. That was a serious shaker. 6.1 has got to be the second biggest earthquake since 89'. I am all for smaller earthquakes, as I figure that will take some pressure off of the fault lines, but I'm not gonna lie and say I didn't jump out of bed and quiver like a little girl haha. Earthquakes are no joke. 




 I didn't realize there were so many Kawakami-apologists out there. I can't stand this guy with the entire fiber of my being. Didn't expect such a lukewarm reception to this.
