 Nice shot! 




 A zealot hero would be my first choice as a starcraft warrior, but I think there are numerous other possibilities. Ultralisks, roaches, and immortals come immediately to mind. A marauder might also be interesting as a hybrid warrior/assassin. Kind of like Sonya, but instead of getting right into the fray, it'd be more focused on zoning enemies out.

The firebat idea is a cool one, I wouldn't have thought of that. 




 My suggestion is to friend the good/friendly people you play with after the matches. You can build up a really good group very quickly that way. 




 Why does he use such a long knife? Seems like it would be awkward to wield, though he certainly isn't having any difficulties with it. 




 I had no idea you could do this. I hope they bring it back, because I always split Olaf off and control Baelof and Erik together, and frequently wished I could bind the latter two together. 




 His D is rather tenacious. 




 I've experienced this a few times since the patch. It happens infrequently, but it definitely happens, and exactly as you say, as soon as I engage in combat for the first time, the game lags for about 3 seconds. 




  It's basically proven that raving toxic lunatics lose more games, and I'd bet my bottom dollar that the kind of person who would use a mute-all button and that toxic jerk are a lot alike, and I want neither on my team.

You've used the phrase "toxic lunatics". Read your comment history, and tell me, honestly, that you wouldn't call somebody who behaves as you do "toxic". Your last 10 comments are extremely hostile and negative. I stopped counting after that, but I'm guessing that this is pretty much your MO.

I mean this seriously, I really think you should do a self evaluation, because your behavior suggests that you've got some serious anger problems that need to be addressed. 




 I think you meant to respond to the parent of my comment. 




 Patch day is normally the second Tuesday.

According to whom? Just because that's when they usually do it, doesn't mean that it's late if they don't. They never said the patch would be two weeks ago. They said it would be early this week, and it was. You need to adjust your expectations, not to mention your sense of entitlement.

If what you meant is that, then you are thanking them for completing their scheduled B.Net maintenance at the time they promised.

I am thanking them for completing the patch at the time that they promised, because that's something that I want to encourage.

Imagine you're Blizzard, and if, like you, everyone were to complain whether you complete the work late or on time, you've got little motivation to be on time.

Truth be told, my post probably doesn't have any meaningful impact on whether they're late or on time in the future, but they were on time yesterday, I appreciated it, and it only took 30 seconds to say so. So I said so. I wouldn't really call that "hero worship", but if you'd like to, by all means. 




 The only thing worse is accidentally dismounting by hitting the mount key, and it's only worse because there is absolutely no good reason for the dismount key/command. Right clicking the mini-map at least serves a purpose.

But yeah, I agree, accidental mini-map clicking is something they absolutely need to fix. It's definitely gotten me killed more than a few times. 




 You mean almost two weeks late with undocumented changes?

What are you talking about? How are they two weeks late?

They said the patch would be yesterday from 3am to 11am PST. The game was back up no later than 10:55am PST. 




 Am I right that if you're not going to kill the towers that it's best to leave them at 1 or 2 bullets, so they don't recharge after you leave? 




 Gorgeous 




 Actually that was meant as a nerf. Ghost Uther was way to powerful before. 

But they are similar, so yeah, hopefully a change is coming for Tyrael, too.  




 Wow, thanks for pointing that out. I totally didn't make the connection. 




 I so wish this would have included a total rework for Tyrael's practically non-existent trait. Alas.

Tons of great changes, though. Can't wait to try them out! I really hope the performance optimizations are significant. 




 What is this referencing? 




 Worthy cause. 




 Yeah. It's just terrible. It almost never does anything of value. I'd much rather have something that helps me *avoid* dying. 




 Agreed on Tyrael (never played Anub'arak). If they just gave Tyrael a worthwhile trait, preferably something that made him a bit more tanky, he'd be okay. 




 I hate Thrall's. It might be thematic, but he goes from intimidating to... not intimidating. 




 Please this. I so want a true solo queue where all 10 players queued solo. 




 Ah, couldn't find the VODs before. I see them now. Thanks! 




 More taxes on the poor.

If this makes you mad, and it should, consider the impact that all of this hopeless desperation has on crime (spoiler alert: it's not going to go down).

Then take a moment and connect the dots: increasing financial burden on the poor, lowering taxes for the rich, and privatizing everything. Where does that lead you?

In other news, Ted Cruz announced that he's running for president today.

Hmmm.... 




 That sounds great. Do you know if his videos are available somewhere? He's only got one up on YouTube. 




 People using abilities just to use them drive me crazy. I'm looking at you, Gorge Stitches. 




 Seems like it. My game DC'd. 




 Same. Yet to see it. 




 The plants would basically provide better insulation. You'd still save money, but I'm with you. I'd rather be generating electricity. 




 He's a lot of fun, but he needs a different trait. The current one is practically non-existent. He's a tank, so he doesn't die a lot (more often than not I'll end a game with zero deaths), it's super easy to avoid the explosion, and even if it hits, the chances of it having a meaningful impact are pretty low.

I'd much rather him have a trait that will help me avoid dying. Given the fact that he's not the tankiest tank, and doesn't put out very much damage, I think giving him a useful trait would put him closer to balanced. 




 That looks amazing. If I didn't have a strong preference for characters that I really like looking like themselves (such as Tassadar), I would definitely buy this skin.

 What if I told you I wanted to have the right to NOT vote? What if I thought voting legitimatize this violent entity?

Submit a blank ballot.

What if I don't want to endorse either democrats or republicans for executive office?

Vote for somebody else, write somebody in, or leave the ballot blank.

Would I be forced to endorse in candidates I strongly disagree with?

No. 




 I certainly hope so. The Protoss are awesome. I'd be happy with anyone out of the Starcraft or Diablo universes, though. 




 That was what I was most looking forward to, too. Very disappointing.

  Legalization won't stop over-age people giving pot to younger people.

What's your point?

"Drug dealers don't ID," and they won't when it's legal (they will still sell pot to youngsters).

Sure, but there will be a lot less illegal pot, especially as more and more states and countries legalize. You don't see kids buying bathtub gin or black market cigarettes. 




 We ended up using JsonFx, because we needed something that worked with iOS. We found it to be somewhat limited and had to hack our way around a few issues, but it got the job done.

We ended up dropping JSON due to size considerations in the end, though, and went with Protobuf instead. 




 I know, it was a joke. 




 Both pretty lackluster. Are we sure these aren't warrior cards? 




 If you're being vastly outnumbered and I run towards you to heal you so you can escape do not run back into the fight, I cannot keep you up.

I hate this so much, and it transcends support. Countless times I've put myself at risk or pop a valuable CD to buy a doomed teammate a small window of escape, but they read it as "reinforcements have arrived, let's do this thing!" and turn around to re-engage the 3+ enemies chasing them.

The end result is always the same: they die immediately and now I'm in the hopeless situation that they were in.

Thanks guy. Thanks. 




 Yet relatively left, figuratively.  




 Free money for everyone, basically.

Here's a good introduction:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIL_Y9g7Tg0

Check out /r/basicincome for more. 




  If people receive money for no reason, then they will just sit around doing nothing.

If you started getting $1,000 checks each month, guaranteed for life, would you quit your job and do nothing? 




 Basically, you give everyone (without exception) free money (without conditions) every month because:

1. We live in a time where resources are abundant enough that we can easily provide the basic necessities of life (food, shelter, healthcare, etc.) for everyone.
2. Automation and efficiency are crushing jobs left and right, and it's only going to get worse.

 WHY THE HELL IS THERE AN UNMOUNT BUTTON!? IT SERVES ABSOLUTELY NO PURPOSE, AND SOMETIMES I ACCIDENTALLY DISMOUNT FORGETTING OR NOT REALIZING I'M ALREADY MOUNTED. SO INSTEAD OF GOING FASTER, LIKE I INTENDED, I END UP GOING SLOWER!

REMOVE THE POINTLESS DISMOUNT BUTTON OR LET US BIND IT TO A DIFFERENT KEY, BLIZZARD! 




 I'd contact the League of Women Voters in your state. They can probably point you in the right direction. /r/ask_politics is probably also a good resource. You might also contact the show. They research this stuff pretty thoroughly, and seem to like getting people involved, so they might also be able to provide you with some help/ideas.

If you still come up empty, reply here and I'll do a little digging myself.

You might also contact your federal representatives and express your support for statehood for territories. Also, share the video with your friends. Awareness always helps a cause.

Good luck!

 That's clever. Roughly the same effect, but quite a bit more versatile, and thus not entirely dependent on spell power.

I like it! 




 Can't confirm, but I don't see why it wouldn't. 




 And deadly poison :( 




 I meant it's not worth your time to try and take advantage of the system. 




 This results in Mars somehow having even less electricity than it currently does. 




  Little did they understand that they can play the game of using cash when it favours you, and using other payments when it doesn't.

I would argue that you couldn't possibly do this to an effect greater than $1 a month, and your time is worth more than that. Thus, it never favors you. 




 Thanks. Deleted this and the other duplicate. 




 How is Warsong Commander broken? 




 Bad warrior card: Check.

Awaiting amazingly powerful mage card. 




 What? 




 Yeah, I'm sure you're right and the balance will be a lot less one sided over time. I don't need an exact 33% split between the three major franchises, but something a little more balanced would be nice. 




 [Tosh](http://www.styleweekly.com/binary/f593/night15_daniel_tosh.jpg) would be bad ass. 




  I love all blizz universes so im probobly bias :P

Well, I love them all, too. That's why I wish the others had more of a presence in HotS. 




 *More*, sure. I just wish it wasn't *most*. 




 7 Wacraft heroes and 0 Starcraft heroes is believable. 3 Diablo characters is not. 




 Ha, sorry :P. 




 Grats! 




 That sounds sensible. Any suggestions for what to say to steer them politely? 




 Yeah, I think the issue was that I didn't have a background image on my mask, or something like that. 




 Google's RSS reader :( 




 That's cool. I like how it just only uses gravity and the conductivity of the copper. I can't believe how fast it is, nor how perfect the sphere is.

Very neat, very clever. 




 That was awesome. 




 Seriously. What the hell. 




 I'm really excited to see what the next version looks like. If they can slim them down and trim $100 from the price, I think I might be interested. 




 Wow. That channel is a gold mine. I could watch these for hours, and I don't even drink!

Thank you for sharing that. 




 I like it, but it would be better if we could have a "mute frequently muted players" option. If you're a jerk, you get flagged and then people don't have to listen to you, but can still communicate with their positive teammates. After a while, the status wears off, lasting longer the more frequently you end up flagged. 




 What am I looking at? Is this the angularjs.org equivalent of Angular 2.0? 




 Good call. Moving post. 




 Ideally I'd like to see:

* An in-depth preview of and release date for Tomb of the Spider Queen
* 3-4 new heroes announced, hopefully not all Warcraft heroes
* New features, such as spectator mode
* More info on the Diablo map
* Pipe dream: announcement of ranked solo and/or random queue 




 If it was as tight and polished as Hearthstone and had something akin to the arena to hold my interest (and let me build up my collection without financial investment), I'd consider it.

Honestly, I'd probably still be playing Solforge if it was as well done as Hearthstone. I thought that game was super compelling, but the actual user experience was very lacking.

I'd play those other games in addition to, not in place of, Hearthstone, though. Hearthstone is awesome. 




 Lime flies when you're halving fun.

 Your frustrations are certainly understandable. Our electoral system does not promote good candidates. Fortunately, there are a number of easy reforms that could correct (or at least improve) the situation. [Here is one such solution that you might find interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE list=UU2C_jShtL725hvbm1arSV9w), and perhaps even fighting for.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this, and enjoy your first election! 




 Beautiful. Gameplay doesn't look very compelling, but it certainly is gorgeous. 




 Just curious, why did this (rather well thought-out) comment necessitate a throwaway? 




 Oh yeah, love that one. 




 LEDs are pretty cheap now. You can get them for ~$7, they last for decades, and they only use like 6 watts. I get them $3 per bulb from my power company. 




 It's up there with [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YkLPxQp_y0) as best one yet, in my opinion. 




 Good luck with your RL stuff. I hope things go well for you. 




 Aye! 




 Why don't they shoot sequels immediately after, then, to take advantage of those same savings? 




 Dunno. I wouldn't pay it much mind. 




 Definitely a must read. Steuver is an amazing writer. 




 Very pretty. Keep up the good work! 




 Three quick pointers:

1. Don't fight pointlessly, especially in the beginning.
2. Experience is extremely important, don't leave a lane empty unless there's a very good reason.
3. If your team is down a person, avoid a fight. If their team is down a person, pick a fight (or try for an objective/mercs).

Good luck and have fun! 




 Same. 




 this stuff takes time

No, it takes competition. The US pays more for slower and lower quality internet access than most of the developed world, and it's entirely because ISPs have a monopolistic hold on their industry. They have no incentive to do better, because we have no choice.

We're lucky to have even two options in Cincinnati (though that only gets us so far), most people only have one, but Google coming to town would not only give us the option of working with a good provider, and also force the bad (Cincinnati Bell) and terrible (Time Warner) providers to do better. 




 I do agree, we are lucky to have a choice (most people don't), and it's nice that some people in the area can get gigabit speed (though sadly I'm not one of them).

That said, Cincinnati Bell's not that much better than Time Warner in terms of customer service/relations, so it would be nice to have a good company like Google come in and raise the bar for customer experience, service, pricing, etc.. 




 Three things to consider:

1. Cincinnati Bell's gigabit service isn't available everywhere. It's certainly not available to me, or I'd be using it. I'm not sure that they offer fiber everywhere yet, either.
2. Competition will force Bell and Time Warner to do better. There's a reason Time Warner and Comcast are among the worst companies in America, and that's the monopoly that they have on their industry. We're lucky to have a second option, though Cincinnati Bell doesn't raise the bar very much. Google most definitely will.
3. Cincinnati Bell's customer service sucks. It's not as bad as Time Warner's, but it's pretty bad. I can't speak to Google's customer service, but they have a reputation for doing things right and for not trying to do everything as cheaply as possible.

3 is the biggest factor as far as I'm concerned. It would be nice to have a faster connection, but the thing I hate the most about our situation is having to choose between Cincinnati Bell (bad) or Time Warner (incredibly bad, and only going to get worse when they've merged with Comcast) and dreading every interaction that I have with them. 




 Did your parents not notice this pattern and perhaps stop taking your brother's (only) word for everything? 




 [There were a number of them in 2014](https://mayday.us/), and will almost definitely be more in 2016. Mostly democrats, but a few republicans and independents as well. 




 Working (if you can), watching Netflix, playing a game, reading an article, reading a book, looking out the window, Skyping with family/friends, etc.. Pretty much whatever you want to do.

If you want to stare at the car ahead of you, like you would be if you were driving the car, then go for it. But I'm guessing most people would/could find ways to put that time to better use if they didn't have to concentrate on the road.

You'll basically have more options (and a safer journey) than you do now. 




 Sorry, I just had futurgasm

 STV is a little different, in that it's a form of proportional representation. It's basically RCV with multiple seats, which pretty much eliminates the problem of gerrymandering, as well as provides better (proportional, if you will) representation. STV is definitely better, but not every seat can be made into multiple seats (mayors, governors, treasurers, the president, etc.), and where we can't, RCV is the way to go.

Here are videos describing each system:

[RCV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE list=UU2C_jShtL725hvbm1arSV9w)

 Actually, it's already in use all over the country. Colleges and director boards love it (because it's way superior), and even a few cities (e.g. Oakland, San Francisco, and Minneapolis) are already using it.

I totally take your point, though, a whole state adopting it for all elections would be a fantastic example with significant visibility. 




 It's rather unfathomable that marijuana could be legal recreationally but not medically. 




 Well, on behalf of everyone who thinks that women should be able to feed their children wherever without fear of judgement, harassment, stares, etc., thank you all for doing this. As you can see, there's quite a bit of support behind your message, and while there are certainly some regrettable opinions on the matter, I think it will definitely help to (to at least a tiny degree) further the discussion and affect positive societal change. 




 Cool! So how did it come about? 




  but the fact that women can have their breast out in public but I can't have my penis out in public.

You think that women being able to be topless in public, just as men can (as of the 1930's, I might add), would create an inequality? 




 Proof? 




  but pulling out your breasts for all the world to see is overkill and honestly quite rude.

Do you wear a t-shirt at the beach? 'Cause you've got 'em, too. 




  witty

Doubtful. 




 It's for people like you that I post these things. That's not healthy, and it's not your fault. It's society's.

Well, it's more for the nursing mothers who still have the fear, and the experience, of harassment. But for you, too! 




 Fantastic! I'd love to see more of your work. 




 Probably. This just relates to federal law. Individual state laws would still apply.

I'm not a lawyer, though.  




 Same.  




 This is one of the strongest arguments in favor of legalization. Not only is prohibition completely ineffective (and counter productive), but in leaving everything to the black market and cartels (including revenue), marijuana isn't regulated at all. 




 Here's hoping (against all prior evidence). 




 change it when faced with a good enough reason to do so

Sadly, she only changed her mind when faced with a *personal* reason (her son's medicinal needs for marijuana). The good reasons for legalization have always been there.

I agree with your message, and I certainly applaud this woman for recognizing her mistake and trying to right it, but I don't think she's exactly a role model for open-mindedness. I'm fairly certain she would still be opposing it if she hadn't had that personal experience, like the many conservatives that oppose gay marriage until a member of their family comes out. 




  Just because some senile old woman wants medical marijuana doesn't make it any more stupid.

Did you maybe mean to say "less stupid"? 




  Just not sure why people want to put another poison in their body

You say "another", but the thing is, marijuana is already ubiquitous. Kids often choose weed because it's easier to get than beer. If prohibition worked that would be one thing, but all it does is funnel money to drug dealers, gangs, and ultra violent cartels, instead of into the economy and into the hands of tax payers. It's entirely counterproductive.

And not only is there a ton of weed out there, it's all entirely unregulated. I know a guy that unknowingly smoked some laced with formaldehyde and it really messed him up.

Furthermore, it's rather senseless to prohibit marijuana and not alcohol and tobacco, when the first is far less dangerous (if dangerous at all) than the other two.

I should point out that I've never tried marijuana, and have no plans to even once it's legal, but I push hard for legalization because it would be a really beneficial thing for the country. I agree there are higher priority issues, but prohibition causes some very significant problems (and really doesn't prevent any), so it shouldn't be on the bottom of the list either. The political will is there, and it's something most people agree upon, so let's do it.

**TL;DR** - Keeping marijuana illegal causes some major problems, serves almost no purpose, and is easily corrected, so let's solve the issues we can while we work on the others. 




 What are identify politics? 




 Identity politics?

Also, while the republicans are certainly starting to come on board, it's the democratic party that has been leading the way on legalization. 




 I assumed when it fell that you had just shut off the current. It just did that on its own? 




 Chris Rock? 




 I agree, but this really bothers me. If I tell you something in confidence, and you tell someone else, you've violated the trust that I've placed in you. Who you told isn't a factor. 




 How does this video have 4k upvotes, but only 579 views? 




 Explain? 




 Exactly how I feel. I hope the more open bill passes, but I'll take both over nothing. 




 The first Eastern state to legalize is going to make a ton of money. 




 Edit: You may vote for as many as you want, so you don't have to choose this one over others if you support it.

 If increasing your water intake doesn't help, consider if you're getting enough vitamin D. I used to get soylent headaches very frequently, and adding a vitamin D supplement every few days helped me, and now I almost never get soylent headaches.

 Worry not! You can still watch the show, assuming you can afford [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/LastWeekTonight) ;). 




 Season 2 just started. 




 I know! I don't have any sort of cable, let alone HBO, and I've seen the main segment of every episode. It's awesome.  




 Yes. Sadly it has like 10 names. I think RCV is the best, as it's the most descriptive, but IRV is a little more accurate. 




 For inherently single-seat races, definitely, though I'd prefer [proportional representation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8XOZJkozfI list=PLqs5ohhass_QZtSkX06DmWOaEaadwmw_D) where possible. 




 Works for me. Try again? 




 Check out WolfPAC. They're doing something about it right now. There are a number of other organizations working towards the goal as well. 




 Even if it were 99%, would you really deny the 1% the medicine they legitimately need just to deny the rest legal access to pot they'd likely have no problem getting illegally? 




 Thanks for pointing that out. Deleted. 




 Amazing what a little competition can bring to a monopolized market. What do they call that, again? Capitalism? 




 Yeah, literally. 




 The manzier! 




 Guys already wear bikini tops on go topless day out of solidarity for women who are still forced to cover up and to protest the double standard. Sends a pretty cool message, I think. 




 The caribou you know are too busy being indicted for tax fraud. 




 That's where I'm at. You can sexualize pretty much any part of the body (legs, abs, etc.). Seems pretty silly to me to arbitrarily hide certain parts. Not only silly, but also counterproductive, as you greatly increase the allure of something by keeping it constantly hidden. 




 Wow. Didn't even think about that. 




 He's probably against people wearing feathers, too, so... 




 Yeah... :( 




 Think we'd be able to tell the difference? 




 This is that. 




 I'd be willing to bet the black market brought in even more the year before, especially since it's still in operation and wasn't heavily taxed and regulated. 




 ? 




 Believe it or not, it used to be illegal for men to be topless in public, too, as recently as the 1930's. I think you wore something akin to a wrestling uniform. 




 As I, and many, many others believe that prohibition is ineffective and counterproductive, yes I do.

Indulge me. Why do you think it should be illegal? 




 No word yet on the state-approved list of garments. 




  The party of small-minded government.

 Why? 




 I wish. The guy also wants to ban yoga pants and beige (skin) colored clothing in public, as well. 




 Without the Alex his opponent was dead to the Abomination. 




 Most of us don't understand it either. It's frustrating, pointless, and harmful on a psychological/emotional level. 




 I was just playing along with the joke... 




 I really hope that you're that guy about everything:

"We're out of mustard."

"This calls for a nude protest." 




 Your name is awesome. "MURGHBURLBUGLBE my dear Watson." 




 Sadly it's 20republicans for the next 2 years. 




 Actually, it used to be illegal for men to be topless in public as recently as the 1930's, if you can believe that. 




 Thank you. It may take us some time to really forgive you, but it's a start. 




 That's where I'm at. I've never used marijuana, and don't intend to even after legalization, but legalization is very important, and if we can get this passed in 2016, it gets us most of what a good legalization bill would, and we can correct it from there.

I know people hate this proposal, and I'd rather see something better passed, too, but I'll take "mostly legal" over "pointlessly  and counter-productively illegal" if that's what we can get. 




 Sure, as long as said settings were appropriate, which is to say anywhere where it would be appropriate for a man to be topless. 




 About 5 years ago I saw my neighbors having sex in the shower with the window wide open. Watched for a couple seconds, thinking if they cared they wouldn't be having sex next to an open window, but then thought "nah, that's not cool", and went to bed. 




 It's a ridiculous double standard that makes absolutely no sense. 




 If the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is going to take the irrevocable step of executing a human being, its capital sentencing system must be infallible."

I agree, and it should only be instated once the system is indeed infallible. Which is to say, never. 




 I bet many do. I'm sure they don't love spending 75% of their time in office raising money for the next term. The democrats will definitely be on board, possibly even a few republicans. 




 Probably because it invariably does. 




 Contact the white house and your federal representatives and express your support. There are also a number organizations, WolfPAC, Mayday.us, and NH Rebellion, to name a few, that are actively working toward this goal (in different ways). Check them out and if you like what you see (WolfPAC's organization is amazing), lend your support to one of them.

Finally, keep an eye on [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik1AK56FtVc).

 Nope. 




 It's free advertising and it doesn't cost them anything. So I don't see why they wouldn't.

That said, they probably won't. 




 I don't know, but I sure hope it's wearing cat-scrubs. 




 Why the ranger guild? 




 Do you wanna Unstable Portal a snowman? 




 I feel like for most situations, Vermont is the right place. 




 Uhh... gimme a minute, I need to switch gears. I almost, yeah... 




 Sure thing. 




 I will say I'm glad that we used one for our honeymoon, because we did a lot, but less involved trip, yeah, this doesn't need to be a thing any more. 




 The laws prevent selling Teslas, not charging them. 




 Well, [replacing FPTP is a good first step](http://www.pressherald.com/2014/11/12/ranked-choice-voting-advocates-gathered-36000-signatures-on-election-day/). 




 Do you own a coal or oil company? If not, I'm not sure why a carbon tax and removing energy subsidies takes money from you. The should also reduce your tax burden, in theory anyway. 




 Well, there's one important distinction:

by demanding substantive change from the two parties in DC.

WolfPAC isn't going through DC. It's attempting to invoke article 5 of the constitution to call a national convention, which wouldn't involve congress (as it is the broken body in question). 
























 I really hate when people give these insignificant morons the attention that they seek by doing and saying awful things. If you detest them, don't give them what they want. Ignore them. 




 This is why I question Blizzard's explanation of poor matchmaking being due to a small player base. Everyone I know that wants to play, can play. The game has pretty much been semi-launched for a while now, and I don't see much changing with launch.

I hope I'm wrong. 




 Contact your representatives and voice support for the measure. Be prepared to say why, as they will most likely ask.

And spread the word. 




 What's next? Handing out seat belts in schools!? 




 Working as intended. 




  They absolutely are not "against" bc.

Not sure about that. They frequently promote "abstinence only" policies.

 They're against public funding for it.

That's true enough, though why it's preferable to pay significantly more for the costs of unwanted pregnancies, rather than paying much less to prevent them, is beyond me.

I'm pretty liberal, though, so paying $X for social policies to prevent $6X in long-term costs is right up my alley. 




  abortions were down 40%

The "pro-life" party in action. 




 I think Jaina is the hero that has the most variability. I feel I'm making a choice at every level, which is fantastic. For most heroes, I have a set build that doesn't change, or if it's only one or two talents that might change situationally. Some heroes I have two builds that are like that.

Jaina is the only one that I play where everything is in flux at almost every level, and I love that about her. Almost all of her talents feel viable and useful, and very few of them stand out as the "correct" choice for every situation. 




 Yeah, probably. But likely lower than if we fail to adequately address climate change. 




 I guess is that they'll be closer to actual prices, given that we subsidize fossil fuels rather heavily. 




 Oh, ha. I never take that talent. Thanks for pointing that out. 




 I might care, if I didn't buy my current Moto X on the promise that it would get fast updates, and am approaching 6 months of waiting for the last update.

Probably going Samsung on my next phone. 




 Here are the ones that I've come up with off the top of my head:

* A Starcraft non-combat support unit like an overlord, raven, arbiter, etc., that has no actual combat abilities, just provides information, buffs, and infrastructure.
* A starcraft builder, like a probe that literally just builds things.
* Ragnaros - literally can't leave the base as he has to inhabit a building at all times. 




  Well, my advice for every gaming site is to copy Rock Paper Shotgun to the letter. They are the only ones I know that are doing it right.

What are you referencing here? What is it that they do that you like? I'm not familiar with them and nothing really stood out as I dug around a bit. 




 Yup. Me too.

TL;DR - Me too. 




 Kinda defeats the point... 




 Grats!

How do you deal with really bad teams? 




 Agreed. Very sad to see that his trait is still not being addressed.

  Leave it to PolitiFact to find a way to rate a completely true statement "mostly false".

It's technically true, but certainly not actually true. You really don't see the distinction? 




 [Wouldn't it be great if you had more than two choices?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE list=UU2C_jShtL725hvbm1arSV9w) 




 You'd hardly be the first, but by all means. 




 What have they distorted? 




 You eat all the cookies. Your mom asks if you ate all the cookies. You say no, because there are billions of cookies still in the world that you did not eat.

Just because what you said was technically true does not mean that you did not lie. 




 You really don't see a problem with distortions of the truth? 




 Don't forget religious freedom. 




 Sgt.Hammer decides to go mines alone.

Hammer's wrong.

Sgt Hammer entered siege mode and died almost instantly.

Hammer's wrong.

she rages

Hammer's wrong. 




 Fair enough, though I wouldn't really call confirming something that he said an attack. 




 Not sure anything is worse than free Hammer week. "Don't worry, guys. I'm sieged!" 




 I feel sorry for people who feel the need to rub it in whenever they have a good move or victory. Why isn't winning enough? 




  Sure, you will get some buildings down before you die but I doubt you will reach a fort this way.

I do it all the time.

Don't get me wrong, I think the team should be there to support the terror, but even if they aren't, I think it can still be very effective. 




 You can do a lot of damage with the terror, even if the enemy is responding. You just need to bounce between forts and try and maximize your W. You might not get a fort, especially if *your* team is ignoring you (which is a pretty big mistake), but you'll still make them feel it. And if your team does show up, you'll really do some significant damage. A fort at least. 




 You mean checking the facts of politicians? I agree. 




 I'm not sure I agree. A well-used terror can easily get 2-3 forts. That's massive. If the other team is ignoring my terror and it results in a 4v5, I think it's on my team to simply play safely while I absolutely wreck the opposing team.

The only times that I think it's all that appropriate to fight as the terror are:

1. If you're near enough to a kill/fight that you can secure it without sinking too much time into it.
2. If you're in desperate need of defense.

Perhaps I'm wrong, but in my experience, you want the terror pushing, especially if the other team is letting you do it. 




 inform themselves of optimal strategies

Agreed, but I think it's worth pointing out that this is not a case of a "non-optimal strategy" so much as it's a "rather significant mistake". 




 Hearthstone crawls. It goes months, often many months, without an update. 




  Also dislike having it select according to team composition, though i can understand and respect that change

I feel the same way. It's pretty much just a "random support" button. But it's better than the alternative. 




 I'd really like to see Mephisto, Baal, Maltheal, or any of the members of the Angiris council. 




 I've updated them many times over the last year. I try and stay current. 




 Zagara is incredibly strong. She dishes out insane amounts of damage from far away and has the ability to zone enemies out very effectively. She almost always dominates her lane, can hold her own in many 1v1 situations (though it's usually a game of chicken), and she's awesome to have in a team fight, especially, though not exclusively, thanks to the incredible power of maw.

Her only serious weakness is her lack of an escape before 20, and you can compensate for that with creep by keeping your route to safety covered and using it to see threats early enough to run.

TL;DR - Zagara is always awesome, just be prepared and informed well enough to run in time, while murdering anything and everything that you don't like (for the swarm, of course). 




  Lv7 Death Touch: A noob trap talent, you should never take this. Frozen Tempest already provides enough damage to kill minions. 

Reminds me of Possession. 




 This is a good idea for Blizzard, because personally speaking, I would never, ever buy anything requiring a timed commitment like that. It would seriously piss me off if I bought a stimpack and then got slammed with work and couldn't use it or something.

If it was based on actual game time or game count, I'd actually consider buying one, but the current form is definitely not an option. 




 Something I ask myself every time I see things like one team having two tanks and no supports, and the other team having two supports and no tanks. Could ya maybe have just... 




 Do many vikings players really soak 3 lanes? Unless it's during an objective, I don't see much purpose to this. I typically put Olaf in a solo lane and keep Baelog and Erik together. As long as you have at least one other person soaking the third lane, you're not gaining anything by putting a viking in it, and you're giving up attention, viking safety, and some pushing ability.

What's the point of having vikings in all 3 lanes? 




 Great save! 




 He's referring to sites like politifact, that attempt to confirm or disprove what politicans say. 




 I disagree. AC could be a 4/3 today and still wouldn't see much play, if any.

OP didn't ask about today. He asked about when I started playing.

 You're not considering the fact that because self driving cars will be much safer, they'll be able to drive a lot faster. So if it's truly a matter of time and patience, you're a lot better off taking those 2 minutes to set up your destination, because you're probably going to get there 30% sooner if you let the car drive.

Also, as has been stated, the state of technology is such that your phone likely knows where you're about to go before you do. So 2 minutes is likely over estimated by about 2 minutes. 




 Looks slick. Wish the gif were a little larger so I could see it better.

Great work! 




  tl;dr: the driver must pay attention at all times to avoid anything the car can't.

Maybe, but not necessarily. Google has recently adopted the stance that a human driver is not a reliable backup for an automated car. A person trying to correct the car's decision making would likely cause more issues than they would prevent.

Of course, we're in very uncharted territory, so we'll see if that pans out or not. 




 It's not a stupid question at all. It's one that is frequently asked, as a matter of fact.

The short answer is yes, it's very possible, and it's something the industry is going to have to account for. 




 I mean after this guy has called for a recorded vote. For example:

17 representatives in the room, Boehner says it's 218, guy runs in and asks for a recorded vote, they count and record a vote, and it's now very clear that there were nowhere near 218. Why hasn't Boehner committed a crime by saying there was? That rule exists for a reason, and he has very obviously broken it. 




 If this angers you, why give them free publicity? They publish outrageous and crazy things to get people's attention, and clearly it's worked on you. 




 Serious question: when Boehner declares a quorum of 218 congressmen, and then the actual count commences and then it is proved that there are like 30 congressmen there, why doesn't Boehner go to jail? Is that not a blatant and undeniable example of fraud and abuse?

And are the records of these obviously false quorums publicly available? I'd love to see what he's tried to get away with. 




  The people in power are afraid it could actually pass

Just the republicans. The democrats voted in favor of legalization. 




 List them? 




  I always thought they were FOR personal freedoms, am I just mistaken?

You are mistaken.

 Beats me. I just play the game. 




 He's super fun and very effective. I don't think he's considered a top-tier hero, but I certainly enjoy playing him. 




 I've had to forfeit several winning games because of this, now that the game is available on mobile. It's my own fault for trying to squeeze in very fast games, but it still sucks. 




 Impressive. Great work! 




 Clever. I like it. 




 Many, even those of us with relatively high end machines, suffer from periods of lower frame rates (30), stutters, etc.. The hope has always been that the game hasn't been optimized yet, and that it would be before launch. 




 What do we think the difference between "open beta" and "launched" will be? 




 As long as you're actually going to monetize it. If it's just going to sit in a repo and die, you might as well let open source it. Otherwise your work is just going to waste.

Looks fantastic, BTW. Would love to hear how you did it. 




 Looks great! Nice job.  




 Thank you. Is totally confused.  




 Sure, here are several key points.

1. Prohibition doesn't work. People that want pot can get pot, and all we're doing is denying ourselves the opportunity to tax and regulate it. It's the exact same thing that happened during alcohol prohibition. In fact, many kids choose pot over beer because it's easier to get.
2. We're taking money and jobs out of the legitimate economy, and giving it directly to gangs, drug dealers, and ultra violent cartels, who, along with marijuana, deal in harder drugs, weapons, and slaves (and who knows what else). To say nothing of the massive tax revenue, and the fact that we're packing for-profit prisons
3. Marijuana is very likely a gateway drug, not because people that use it are inspired on to harder drugs, but because anyone that wants pot has to know a drug dealer. CVS is not going to push meth while it's selling you pot, but your normal weed hook
4. Weed is, by virtually all accounts, harmless. In a free society, you don't need a reason to make something legal, you need one to make it illegal.
5. We're packing for-profit prisons and destroying the lives of many law-abiding citizens. We lock them up, ruining their jobs/careers, and when we do release them, they're now in a harder situation and with many more criminal contacts.
6. We're arbitrarily denying people medicine and treatments that could really help them. Medical marijuana is often the only thing that can relieve pain and siezures for many people, and is now even being shown to be an effective treatment to some types of cancer. People are suffering, and in some cases dying, all in the name of (not really) inhibiting the use of recreational substance far less harmful (if harmful at all) than alcohol.
7. The only people who have something to lose by legalization are drug dealers, cartels, for-profit prisons (and the industry built around the monetization of incarceration), and beer companies. The rest of society, even non-smokers (like myself, don't plan on ever even trying it) will benefit almost immeasurably.

Oh, you said arguments *against* legalization! Yeah, I've got nothing there... 




 Well, if you lock them out for a period of time, those players will simply be in (and thus leave) fewer games. 




 Legitimate disconnects and reasons to leave the game exist, sure. I'm talking about the ones that do it frequently. The first one each week should be free. If you're quitting more than that, it's almost surely not due to emergencies. 




 It's entirely redundant with her kit, it serves absolutely no purpose in a team fight, and Wailing Arrow is insanely good.

Honestly, if you removed the increased CD for mercs, I'd still take Wailing Arrow. 




 Sounds good to me. 




 I think so. 




 Yeah. Maybe the first game you quit you can't queue until it's over, but the second in a week gets you a 24 hour suspension, with higher and higher times.

Clearly these people aren't that interested in playing the game anyway, and the rest of us sure won't miss them. 




  I still don't see what the benefits are of legalizing it other than some hypothetical talk about how much money it'll bring in from taxes.

It's far from hypothetical. Look how much Colorado has already brought in.

I don't want people getting stoned and then possibly getting behind the wheel or doing something that ends up hurting or killing someone else.

Here's the core thing to focus on: prohibition isn't prevent people from using pot. They already are. Tons and tons of them. Many kids choose weed over beer because it's a lot easier to get. The only things we're doing by making it illegal is giving up the opportunity to regulate it, and funding criminal enterprises. 

If they go making it legal for cancer patients as a pain management drug, do they really believe those patients are going to be the only ones using it?

This is a particularly disturbing comment. If you'd let people suffer in an attempt to keep other people from using marijuana recreationally, I think you really need to re-examine your priorities.

Sure it might slow down the black market for pot

When is legal all across the country, there will be no black market. If you want proof, try and find a liquor bootlegger.

the bigger problem is what pot does to you when you smoke it.

Alcohol is far more harmful than pot. Do you support a return to alcohol prohibition as well?

TL;DR - Prohibition doesn't keep people from using marijuana, and it does far more damage than it prevents (if it prevents any at all). 




 Didn't mean to. Thanks for letting me know. 




 The problem is that in almost all cases, you're better off closing the distance and doing something else.

Much of the time, yes, but not almost all of the time. Knowing the difference is what makes it good.

It's not that the long-range banelings are a hard-to-land skillshot on the Zagara players' part

It's not always about landing the banelings. Often it's about zoning your opponent out.

Anyway, feel free to disagree. I think it's a good talent. 




 The only thing I disagree with is that Baneling Range isn't good. I find it very useful. When you get good enough with it, you can put it to some really great effects, such as cutting enemies off from a route of escape, splitting them up, dissuading a chase you want to avoid, disrupting objectives, adding presence to a fight from afar, etc.

I'm not saying that it's better than the regeneration, but it's definitely a worthwhile talent, once you've gotten good with it. 




 That number, and the ones in the comments, are way, way lower than I would have thought them to be.

Reddit has a maximum population of Ohio... 




 True. It's not a bad pick. I just prefer Hardened Shield. 




 Really clever. Nicely done.

I build a little differently, though:

4: Amplified Healing if we have a healer, if not deadly strike if their team is especially squishy, Swift Reflexes otherwise. SR is nice, but Chen is unbelievably tanky as is, and chances are SR is going to proc during a shield.

13: Enough To Share - most enemies are smart enough to not attack Chen, so extending your shield to allies while you drink is quite valuable in a team fight.

16: Bolder Flavor - You can survive just about anything with this.

20: Hardened Shield - Makes you truly unkillable. I really just take this, though, because the other options aren't fantastic. Bolt of the Storm is redundant with Flying Kick, and the barrel is plenty strong as is. Kind of a lackluster level 20 for Chen. 




 Good for you. Never give up! 




 I agree, but I do really like that there are hybrid heroes like Tassadar, Sonya, Sylvanas, etc., so if there is a change made in this direction, I'd like it to be a small one. 




 This deck was great a couple of weeks ago, but now I can't win with it to save my life. It's just far too slow. Unless I draw early innervates and wild growths (which I mulligan for aggressively), by the time I have enough mana to play anything of value I'm instead spending my turn on healbots to prevent my inevitable demise. Even with the early mana cards, face hunters burn me down too quickly, and I often don't have a way to play around mirror entity. As mages and hunters make up 90% of play right now, those are two very big problems.

Suggestions? 




 What he said:

Despite what Republicans may want you to think, unrestricted free trade is not a Constitutional right.

Your response:

Republicans aren't out to wreck the country just because you don't agree with them on everything.

Quite a leap you took there. 




 As much as I'd like to see poor neglected Diablo get a 7th hero, Fenix would be my first choice as well. I think they could make a really interesting hero out of a zealot, Starcraft needs a warrior, and while they're certainly in better shape than Diablo, they could definitely use a little loving to help balance out Warcraft's dominance of the roster.

And Protoss are cool. 




 That would put it about 3 weeks away, which would really suck. 




 I really hope it's a Diablo or Starcraft hero, especially if it fills a role gap for those franchises (support and warrior respectively). 




 I really want to see Mephisto, Baal, Izzul, Malthael, or one of the other members of the Angiris Council. 




 Making him slightly weaker than the Hearthstone version. 




  Get your shit together republicans.

 Is this a quote from something awesome? 




 Write an op ed.  




 Did it eat the freezing trap? 




 Are you under the impression that people can't get weed now?

Let see how the younger generation is effected, as teens become more frequent users.

Many kids choose pot because it's easier to get than beer. I'd be amazed if actually regulating marijuana, instead of effectively ignoring it, doesn't decrease teen use. 




 Instructions unclear. Punched friend in genitals. Did not hurt. 




 Constance Justice 




 Tyrael. Total bad ass and bully. If only he had a trait.  




 My favorites are Master Tyrael (both white, which I run, and black), and the green Hellscream Thrall.  




 Black master Tyrael is great, but I like the white one better. Fits his character better, and as a tank I want to have a big, bright presence.  




 It's gotten a lot worse lately, too. Never used to be much of a problem but now I see it somewhat frequently. I wonder if I've just dropped in MMR to a place where these immature players are more frequently seen.  




 Suggestion: buy a hero. 




 Or the state could just stop murdering people. That sounds like a pretty good plan. 




 And how will we deal with all of the glaciers!? 




 Majordomo, a legendary so bad that you're better off giving him to your opponent. 




 "These games wouldn't be as good if it wasn't for the opponent across from me".

Classy guy. Wins handily, but he's still gracious enough to compliment his opponent. That's the demeanor of a true champion. 




 "Even though some might say this is just a teenage prank, who knows what this teenager might have done," Nocco said.

Based on that logic, you could charge somebody with murder for picking up a knife. "Who knows how many people he might have stabbed!" 




 There are a number of issues with it, but the primary one, at least as far as I'm concerned, is that it actually makes you *more likely* to die, as it's factored into his kit's balance. In other words, if it didn't exist, they would have to buff him in some other way to keep him balanced. The more they buff his death, the weaker he is while alive, and thus, less likely to remain so. 




 Cool concept, but having faced him in Hearthstone, I don't know that I could take that much of the voice actor. 




 Tyrael just needs a better trait and he'd be fine. He's really fun, and very effective, but his trait pretty much doesn't exist.

A minor stat buff might not be untoward, either, as his stats are very low across the board, but the trait is the bigger issue. 




 Do we think this is for real?

I, for one, would love to see faster hero releases. One of the best things about this game is the variety of the heroes and their playstyles, and I can't wait to get my hands on more. 




 Tyrael is a full tank, he is designed to soak damage, not die.

I main Tyrael, and I build him very tanky, but I disagree with this. I think he does a better job initiating and bullying than soaking damage. He's not squishy by any means, but I would consider him an off-tank, not a full tank.

I think that would change if he had a worthwhile trait that contributed to his survivability, though. 




 The big problem with death traits is that they're factored into a hero's balance, meaning not only does Tyrael's trait do nothing to keep him alive, it actually makes him *more likely* to die, as the rest of his kit pays some price for his death explosion. 




 Disrupting the enemy's positioning momentarily is *very* little recompense for losing your tank. 




 The problem is that death traits suck. They're basically a small reward for being bad, and they do absolutely nothing for you while you're alive.

You could buff his trait to oblivion and it would still suck. 




 Agreed. His trait is practically non-existent. It does nothing while he's alive, and hardly anything when he dies as it's both easily avoided, it's almost never enough damage to get a kill, and even if you do get a kill, your team is now missing a tank.

The big problem with death traits is that they're factored into a hero's balance, meaning not only does Tyrael's trait do nothing to keep him alive, it actually makes him more likely to die, as the rest of his kit pays some price for his death explosion.

It'd be much better if he had something that helped *avoid* his death, rather than making his death slightly inconvenient for the enemy team.

Here's my idea:

 **Archangel's Watch**
 
 Every time a hero deals damage to Tyrael, that hero gains a stack of guilt which decreases damage done to Tyrael by 0.5% per stack. Upon reaching a maximum of 10 stacks, the hero is deemed guilty and one of Tyrael's wings reaches out and grasps the hero. Guilty heroes are always revealed and have an additional 5% of the damage they deal to Tyrael reflected back at them.
 
 If a hero leaves Tyrael's area of influence, all of that hero's guilt is forgiven, and if Tyrael or any of his enemy heroes dies, all enemy guilt is forgiven.

This gives Tyrael some additional survivability (after a while he's taking up to 10% less damage from heroes focusing him), and it's very thematic. You shall pay for your sins, but an enemy's sacrifice can absolve you of your guilt. And Tyrael does use his wings when he fights, because he's a bad ass. 




 Thanks! 




 Good advice. I almost didn't ask for this reason, though I'm still curious. 




 How can you see their rank if they talk? 




 Welcome! Glad you're having fun :) 




 It could even be a boat! 




 If they bring the cast back together and make the show snappy once more, then I'm excited. Season 4 was just a terrible, confusing, poorly paced, unfunny mess, and if it's more of that, then I'm not even going to bother watching. 




 What's wrong with that song? 




 This is huge. I was really disappointed when they removed the AWD option from the 60. Not that I could afford $70k, let alone $75k, but it's nice to know that if I could, that I again would. 




 Agreed. The Kerrigan text is on screen for literally less than 2 seconds.

I would pull this down and put some more time into it. 




 Why Overload? I get your point about not being able to take advantage of Conjurer's Pursuit, but what does the extra range get you that's worth losing the mana that comes from Psi-Infusion? 




 This is why I'm really glad that there's no surrender option. I've been down like this and come back. I know it's rare, but I'm glad that I always have the option to try. 




 Life finds a way. 




 Do you keep inane amounts if glitter on hand for such an occurrence? Or would you have to go (hopefully) buy some? 




 Diversity is healthy for the party. Also, I consider myself a liberal, not a democrat. 




 What does "Basalisk" refer to in this instance? Is that the name given to the theoretical killer robot? 




 Bad form. 




 It is awkward, but play him enough and you'll get surgical with positioning it. It's a feel thing, and it comes in time.

And yeah, I generally ignore the speed boost. It's nice, and on some occasions I factor it in, like if I'm not in any danger but an ally is, I'll use it along with my Q and W to help them escape. But largely I just use it for the damage.

 When I went to WWDTM a couple weeks ago (with Richard Price), I had *so* much fun

You snuck the body of [an 18th century Welsh moral philosopher and nonconformist peacher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Price) into a taping of WWDTM?

Impressive. 




 Agreed. I've come back from some pretty staggering deficits, as well as been on the other end of that stick. The fact that you can be way down, but win a crucial team fight that positions you for the win means that every single fight matters.

One of my favorite things about this game is that it's not over until it's truly over. Players that understand this will have an edge over those that don't, and that's a good thing. 




 Cool!!! Eventually! Someday. Maybe... 




 Awesome! Thanks for posting this.

I know that they mentioned having problems with the chipset, but if fast updates where part of the phones promotion, and it's been this long and we still don't have the latest update, then it's going to make me not want to do business with that company in the future.

This is the big dissuading factor for me, as well. It took 2 months to get 4.4.4, too, and we never even got 4.4.3. 




 Hence the fact checking... 




 The question is, what *did* I do? 




 Good idea, but that didn't have any impact.

Thanks for the suggestion.

 What is "this"? 




 Awesome! 




 I agree. Any time I've used Possession, I've thought wondered what picking up an extra minion per wave was really doing for me, considering how hard I could push lanes anyway.

More importantly, though, was during team fights, I was really wishing I had something that was useful in a team fight...

I like the charge idea a lot. 




 You mean because yesterday was 3/29? ;) 




 I don't know, I didn't go in a Burger King. 




 Thanks. 




 Glad to see both shaman cards are good. Almost as glad I was to see that both mage cards are weak. 




 He's probably referring to the arena where warrior is extremely weak. 




 How did you check your average game length? Time a few? 




 How does one keep game times down? Really fast decks and forfeiting a lot? 




 Pre-grats!

What's your secret? Incredible patience? Do you forfeit a lot to stay at lower ranks and get better opens? 




 'Cause of the metric system? 




 Quartermaster with cheese? 




 Great site. Just need something to deal with the trolls. Auto-hide functionality based on downvotes is probably ideal, but in the meantime you might want to delete some of the more egregious ones.

Also the ability to un-vote would be nice. So clicking downvote twice would bring you back to having not-voted, like reddit does.

Thanks for the effort! 




 How can you see the ranks of your teammates? 




 Though probably not the one he intended to make :P. 




 Great idea. That works be super cool. 

I love the interactions between the heroes. I wish their were more of them.  




 For #2, I generally find the reverse to be true. The more pushed our lanes are, the farther we are from our towers. That's why I try not to push without a good reason (e.g. upcoming objectives). 

Is my thinking flawed? 




 Around $80USD.  




 How did you play it? Straight push? Run from fights and ignore objectives? 




 It's not correct, but it's accepted. "He" and "she" are singular, "their" is plural.

Many of us use "their", though, because "he or she" is very cumbersome, and there just isn't a better alternative (yet). 




 Done. Thanks for the suggestion. 




 My first thought as well. The immortal's shield doesn't proc on lethal damage, but I think it's close enough. 




 Who said anything about the immortal being Fenix? 




 If it's early September it will only come out approximately 2 years before the 2013 gets 5.0.2.

I wonder if the Moto X 2019 will be released before we get 5.1.

Bitter. 




 Similarly, don't pee *into* the hot tub, either. 




 The music was depressing. Kind of killed it for me. 




 Makes sense. I'm just surprised that he uses it for fine work, too. That has to take some serious mastery. 




 Great tips! Would love to hear more.

Thanks for sharing! 




 Got it. Thanks. 




 Makes sense. Really I just want to know if 90 is low or high, and what that number being lower or higher means. 




 Poor Tyrael really needs some love. 




 Fantastic!

One suggestion: lose Title, Role, and Franchise. They don't really provide much (especially title), and they take up valuable horizontal real-estate.

Thanks for putting this together! 




 Before this current free hero rotation, I swear I hadn't seen him within my last 100 games. Not once, on either side. 




 Nice shot. That had to feel good. 




 Which episode is it from? 




 What is this referencing? Sunny? 




 And Ainsley gets to pee in Leo's closet? 




 I say pack token, and if we're going down that road anyway, also implement golden card tokens as arena (but not pack) prizes. These let you change a card of an appropriate rarity golden (e.g.an epic token can make a common, rare, and epic token). 
























  Remember the reason the Soviet Union failed, and that there was no food on the shelves, is that nobody wanted to work. Incentivization was gone.

The important thing to remember is that UBI is giving people just enough to cover their basic needs. Something like $1,000 per month. There's still plenty of incentive to work, as very few people would be comfortable with $12,000 per year. I know I sure wouldn't. 




 Ha. Remember when toolbars were a thing? 




 If you got $1000 for free every month would you stop working? 




 Old people vote. Young people don't. That's why the country is considerably more liberal than the government. 




 We've needed this for so long (even if it's as simple as [this](http://i.imgur.com/Y792nwi.jpg)), especially since we've got two ults to choose from, usually based on comp, not to mention the other talents. 




 I like this idea, though it'd require publicly funded elections as well, since the corruption that currently plagues our political system would not be resolved by taking away government salaries. 




 /r/gogopgo 




 [This](https://youtu.be/ecIBE8zNimw?t=10m34s) should be easier. 




 Imagine that. 




 I still don't understand how openly opposing net neutrality isn't political suicide. It's 2015. Being against a free, open, and unconstrained internet is like being anti-puppy.

I suppose it helps that most of their voting base is using AOL (if anything), but still. Wow. 




 She sounds like the sorcerer's apprentice. 




 Downvoted, not for being wrong, but for the weird hybrid question/statement sentence. 




 Well one shot, one kill met. 




 I noticed that, too. 




  Just mute and move on.

Words to live by. 




 Good call, especially about the boss part. I should do a separate post about not doing mercs because they're there. It's gotten (understandably) really bad since launch, wherein I find myself answering "Boss?" where they're all up and we're down a person with a "No!" quite frequently.

The other merc camps can be just as bad, too, especially with heroes that can't clear them quickly (which includes Sylvanas, people). I can't tell you how many times I've seen a wipe caused by one person doing mercs for no reason while the rest of the team is fighting 4v5 (usually over a temple or a tribute). 




 If you lose someone before the team fight really even begins, disengage. Don't fight. One person down sucks, go do something productive instead of seeing how many kills you can feed them.

This one drives me crazy. It's such a simple, obvious combat, but I can't tell you how many times I've seen idiotic team members dash in to start a fight right after we lose someone.

"I'll avenge you!" No. You won't. You'll just wipe the team. 




  If both teams go 4-1 then you're both just mutually deciding to exploit each other in the same way, and then either team has an option to change things up to mitigate the other team's strategy.

Yes. If both teams go 4-1, neither has the advantage (from a lane setup perspective), but if one team doesn't, then the 4-1 will have the advantage. So with 4-1, the worst case scenario is no advantage, best case you've got a significant advantage.

I don't see why going 3-2 couldn't do fine against that depending on the comp.

They might be fine, but they're playing at a disadvantage. As I said, the lane with 2 in it isn't doing anything the lane of 1 isn't, and now the lane of 3 is down a person that might secure a kill, prevent a death, etc.. 




  kill your 2
 That's kind of a big assumption, isn't it? Why can't the 2 at bottom just play really passively, soak, poke, and NOT DIE?

You're right. They can do exactly that. And in that case, you just keep them bottled up and wait for a good opportunity, making sure all 3 lanes are soaking. 




 Yeah, it's 4-1 before the mines, then all 5 in the same entrance for the mines, then all 5 killing the golem (unless your golem is huge). From there in theory you'd go back to 4-1, but that rarely happens. It's mostly just the start of the game. 




 What part don't you follow? 




 Sadly, I think this has been happening for years in various parts around the country. 




 Ha, fair enough. 




 How do you deal with a 1-1-3, wherein the solo top just soaks while the 3 bot kill your 2, secure the shrine, and then rotate up? 




  PSA: Soak until 10, prioritise team fight above 10.

Agreed. 




 Very true, and very good. 




 It's a matter of who votes. The older you are, the more likely you are to vote, and the less likely you are to support legalization. That's why the country is far more liberal than the government is. 




 If the 3 is on top it's pretty reasonable. 




  I'm one of those Californians who never has, and never will smoke pot. But I would vote to legalize it because I'm convinced it doesn't hurt society, but enforcing pot laws does.

Same on all counts (except being a Californian). 




 Had to solo bot with Johanna in my last game (on Blackheart's) because Sylvanas went top :(.

Johanna's fantastic in a solo lane (because she's unkillable, and she has great wave clear), and I even managed to out-push the Zagara against me, but still. It was Sylvanas... 




 How is that bullshit? That's what they're reporting... 




 When in actuality it's "free market", "small government" republicans. Well that and the alcohol, for-profit prison, and other lobbyists helping them get re-elected. 




 I don't know of a reason not to do 2-1-2 (or maybe 1-3-1) on the spider queen map. Would be interested to hear if anyone knows otherwise. 




 A significant 437 megawatts of solar panels were installed in the first quarter, which was a 76 percent increase from the first quarter of 2014, said the report.

Your profits grew by 437 megawatts ;) 




 What the hell was that? Everything of substance was edited out of the video. 




 Grats!

Share some tips? 




 People shouldn't quit, period. I can't tell you how many games I've seen where one team has been way, way down the entire game, only to come back for a sudden, crazy victory. The only commonality between all of those games is that no one on the team that came back stopped trying.

Also, it's a game, and games are about having fun. Even I'm the only one up with the entire enemy team and a 100 skull totem on our core, I still try and get that last kill for fun.

Anyone who surrenders is denying their team a chance at a comeback, and themselves the opportunity to enjoy the game a little more. 




 Feel the hatred of 10,000 hues! 




 Well fought. I concede. 




 The progressives are the ones fighting for legalization. It's the right's voting base that's against it. 




  he can hop his ass on the next slow boat to Cuba.

Actually, [he can't](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/gop-led-house-votes-restrictions-travel-cuba-31529147). 




 Thanks for sharing this. 




 When it suits them. 




  it's annoying as @%!$.

FTFY 




 Only when it suits them. 




 I see what you did there. 




 Wait, you mean Frostbolt can be used on minions and the enemy hero as well? 




 He's not. Nobody actually paying attention favors keeping it illegal. He's just in some industry's pocket: Alcohol, for-profit prisons, cartels, etc.. Those are really the only people hurt (and, more importantly, not tremendously helped) by legalization, so they're the ones paying to keep it illegal. 




  Yes, a lot more people smoke pot, openly.

FTFY 




  Wait, so a Republican candidate is promising to stomp all over state's rights if he gets elected? Either I'm missing something here or he is a even bigger moron than I already thought he was.

What you're missing is that republicans are for states rights and smaller government only when it aligns with what they want. They have no problems with the government oppressing gay rights, waging a counterproductive war on drugs, subsidizing fossil fuels, etc.. 




 Contacted the mods. Seems it was a mistake of some sort and they've fixed it.

Thanks for pointing this out. 




 Not going to go into it, but if you do even a small bit of research, you'll see there are many strong reasons for legalization, and more importantly that keeping it illegal causes some huge problems. I'd suggest you look into the issue a little deeper. 




 Ah, and then 20 is "Hero of the Storm"? 




 Thanks. I wasn't sure what the pattern was. 




 Not necessarily. I don't think that Zagara's hydralisks preclude the possibility of a hydralisk hero, for example, and don't forget that Tyrael and the Angelic Valla skin both exist. 




 Sorry, thought I'd stripped the timestamp out :( 




 That was super fun. Loved the music.

If you do another, maybe cut down on the number/duration of the ones that just throw things at the spawn point. Didn't find that as interesting, but the rest was great.

Well done. 




 I've been with and loved Google's ecosystem ever since Gmail launched, though I didn't switch to Android until about a year ago. I always liked my iPhones (3G, 4, and then 5), and only switched because I dropped and shattered my 5 mid-contract. I figured since I was so embedded in Google's ecosystem anyway, I'd see what the fuss was all about.

So I got a Moto X 2013, and was struck right away how much faster, smoother, and reliable my iPhone 5 was, despite the fact that it was 1.5 years older. I was really amazed how buggy Android is. Apps crashed all the time, I had huge problems connecting to Bluetooth devices, Chromecast doesn't work nearly as well as it did in my iPhone (which is not at all what you'd expect), and it's slow as hell.

Over time I've kind of gotten used to it, and I must say that a lot of the issues have gotten better. iOS is still a much smoother and user friendly experience. Any time I use my wife's 3 year old iPhone 5, I'm blown away by how responsive, fast, and fluid it is. Android still hasn't caught up in that regard. It's not even close.

The other thing that really sucks is the fragmentation and lack of updates. I chose the Moto-X because everyone said it would get fast updates. It took 2 months to go from 4.4.2 to 4.4.4 (we never got 4.4.3 at all), and I'm at about 6 months waiting on Android 5. It's also not nearly a customizatable as I'd heard. You can specify default apps for actions, which is nice, and I'm sure that if I jumped through some hoops and found some homebrew solutions to things, I could make a few things happen how I like, but most of the time if I want to change something, there's no solid solution to do it. The phone unlocks a lot in my pocket, for example, and I wanted to change the slide mechanism to be more like iOS's, wherein it goes the whole width of the phone and in only one direction. Nope. Not possible.

All in all, Android is pretty rough and it has some huge flaws and shortcomings compared to iOS.

That said, I don't think I'll ever go back, and it comes down to three things:

1. The ecosystem. This really is number one. I can tie everything together, and my devices can talk to each other. Everything ties in through my Google account, and it's really great.
2. It does more. While iOS does many things better than Android, it simply doesn't have the same capabilities. This isn't a huge deal, but it is something that I've learned to appreciate.
3. The things that it does better, it does WAY better. Maps, voice control, cross-app integration, etc..

So while I don't love Android, I am happy that I switched. If it weren't for the ecosystem, I'd probably go back, but Apple's ecosystem is terrible, so here I stay.

I hope this helps, and if you have any specific questions, feel free to ask. 




 More Starcraft and Diablo characters, particularly more zerg, protoss, and angels. 




 Wall is picked quite often. Used properly under the right conditions it is considerably more powerful than archon. 




 Can confirm. Archon definitely cannot kill a friendly Valla that quickly. 




 IT FUCKING HAPPENED. THEY CALLED THE GAME "DONE" WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE MOST ICONIC CHARACTERS, THE FUCKING ARCHANGEL OF JUSTICE, ESSENTIALLY DOESN'T HAVE A HEROIC TRAIT!

5% DAMAGE REDUCTION, THAT'S ALL THEY HAVE TO DO. IT'S NOT OP, IT'S PROBABLY EVEN WORSE THAN HIS CURRENT TRAIT, BUT YOU'D NEVER LOOK BACK ON A GAME AND THINK "MY TRAIT DID NOTHING".

'CAUSE AS A TYRAEL MAIN, RIGHT NOW MY TRAIT DOES NOTHING.

DELAUNCH AND FIX IMMEDIATELY! 




 How about summoned creatures, like Zagara's hydralisk? Do any of them award experience? 




 I had no idea. Thanks! 




 Great little story. 




 Really? 




 First four are great. Hell no to mind flay. Your hand is, and should be, sacred. 




 I tried AMD the last time around. The thing that guaranteed that I will never make that mistake again was the fact that nearly every time I updated my drivers, I had problems. It got so bad that I would go 6 months between updates, because I didn't want to deal with the hassle. 

Now that I'm back with Nvidia, I update every month. It takes 1 minute, no reboot, no problems.  




 Swimming, definitely. Swimsuits are pointless and awful. 




 Seriously, these 2 universes are also part of Heroes of the Storm

Technically true.

not just Warcraft

Actually true (sadly). 




 Thanks. Of course. 




 Thanks. I appreciate your support. 




 Guess which quest I just got. 




 Old people vote, young people don't, and thus the country is significantly more liberal than its representation. 




 No deal. Assassin is my least favorite role.

I actually really do like supports and specialists, I've just kind of overdone them due to all of these quests and I'd love to play some warrior (my favorite). 




  they aren't going to let you reroll your quest until you get a quest that lets you play the same one hero you always pick.

Two things:

1. I play tons of different characters. I don't have a "character that I always pick".
2. I've gotten practically (maybe even literally) nothing but specialist and support quests for the past week. The reason for this post is because I'm sick of playing those two roles (both of which I normally enjoy, but it's getting a little crazy). The current system isn't exactly diversifying things for me. 




 Not so! RCV's already in place around the country, and growing, thanks largely (though not entirely) to [citizen intiatives](http://www.pressherald.com/2014/11/12/ranked-choice-voting-advocates-gathered-36000-signatures-on-election-day/). Much like marijuana legalization. 




  the only way we have a chance of doing anything about it is if we start managing to elect unelectable politicians.

They're only unelectable because [we're using a sucky electoral system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo list=PL-cJs8aiZ912jQj_X1i91gvc1gbkCc0FD). 




 I miss the square of the 90's, when the games were great, and the titles made sense.

Though to be fair, while Type-0 HD is awful, nothing will ever beat Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days. You gotta wonder if someone just dropped a coffee mug on the keyboard, and thought "Sure, that's the title". 




 You gotta wonder what the harm is in giving us an approximate time. Yes some people will be mad *if* the time slips, but everyone *is* mad that we're all just sitting here hitting refresh. If I were Blizzard, I'd take the possible heat over the definite. 




 Just watched this and can't help but think that the same people being screwed by this massive chicken corporations are almost undoubtedly voting for the republicans fighting the regulations that could protect them from these abuses. 




 I love these so much. Can't wait for specialist! 




 I wonder how many talk show hosts they polled. There can't be that many of them. 




  Obviously those tactics are not working, as the gap keeps growing larger.

But we're not doing those things. We raise the minimum wage very infrequently, certainly not keeping up with inflation, and the rich seem to get a new tax break every week.

Seems to me like we're doing the opposite of those things, and *that's* why the gap is growing. 




 I believe the loan is unaffected by the tax rebate. So you'd still owe the bank (or whomever) $20k, but you'd pay $6k less in taxes, so you could put that, which would normally have gone to taxes, towards the loan. 




 June 1st? 




 Yeah, I've thought about Rehgar front-loading his re-mount CD as well. Edge cases, but not nothing.

I was joking about the keys, I would probably bind it to CTRL+Z or something. I've never intentionally dismounted (except maybe to dance before the game starts), but you never know. 




 Contact your local democratic party. They'll point you in the right direction. 




 My hopes for launch are the same for every patch for about as long as I've been playing:

1. A Tyrael trait rework.
2. Judgement's many bugs being fixed.
3. The ability to bind the mount and dismount commands to different keys. Mount I'll keep on Z, and I think dismount will move to CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+F8+Scroll Lock. Because why would I ever want to go slower?

Not asking for much, but sadly I've been asking for a long time. 




 I hope this turns out to be true, but who's not playing yet that wants to? There have been excess keys floating around for months. I don't see a big flood of new players coming.

But I hope I'm wrong. 




 Thank you for translating, and for Blizzard for giving the noobs some very easy characters for launch week. Can't screw that list up too badly. No Nova, Illidan, Abathur, or Hammer. 




 Got one in my neighborhood, too.

Prices are falling rapidly. We'll have ours soon enough. 




 Didn't notice that. My bad. 




 Agreed. They rage so hard when you do this, but anyone who thinks a 2v4 is a good idea is probably going to find something to rage about eventually. 




 Didn't notice that until you pointed it out. No idea. Weird. 




 I think that statistic speaks more towards the owners than the dogs. 




 Seems fitting. Small heals are kind of Tyrande's thing. 




 Thanks. I wondered the same thing. 




 It's a child, either literally or emotionally. Just report and don't give him a second of your time. 




 Two things:

First, EVERYONE is talking about Anub'arak. Constantly.

Second...

but a 61% Anub is untouched.

It hasn't even been 3 weeks. I'm sure Blizzard is aware of how ~~kinky~~powerful Anub'arak has become, but it would be pretty rash of them to make an adjustment so quickly. 




 Or even better, do both! 




 Kinda hard for the homeless to make use of solar panels...

Glibness aside, I take your point, that they could be giving that money to someone even more needy. I think the idea is that it's an investment. Sort of a "teach a man to fish" kind of thing, wherein the value of the solar panels over time will grow beyond the initial cost, thus the recipients get more bang for the state's buck. 




 I get (and very much like) this:

Every 6 weeks to launch two heroes.

But can anyone decipher this part:

The current plan is that after all will be made every 6 weeks may contain two new heroes of the big patch, one of the heroes of the patch while online, while the other is unlocked after a period of time the patch. (like Johanna) 




 Solar panels work when it's not sunny, too. Just not as well. 




 I do this a lot, too, trying to maximize my laning time as best as I can, based on the situation. 




 Correct. 




 I try and do this on my when when I've got a health globe talent and a hero that I feel can pull it off without missing out on experience or putting myself at risk. Tyrael, for example, can bring down a wave quickly, as well as use his Q to get there in time.

Often only possible on the smaller maps, like the tomb or Dragonshire, and doing this can also be a bit of a mana drain, but if you can pull it off, it helps a lot. 




 Thank you. 




 The damage is nice, but incidental. The silence is the team killer. 




 Just as long as nobody who has ever worked on NCIS is involved.  




 I'd be happy if they simply sorted alphabetically by default. I never find myself wanting to sort by release date.

Even better would be if it remembered the sorting and filters. So if I sort by price and come back to the store, it's still sorted by price. 




  Why do you feel like you need to be rewarded for every step

That's a bit of a stretch. I said when you hit 60 with a class. That's hardly "every step".

Anyway, most of us don't care about golden cards we're never going to use. As such, it's not really a reward, and I think hitting 60 is a significant accomplishment that the user should be rewarded for. 




  Loki is kind of a special case: I may change Loki's wording, but I never change his mind.

This is awesome, and I think that this is exactly what makes you such a great writer. 




 Making good use of that golden Dalaran Mage, are you? 




 There's the "pro life party of small government" in action. 




 Very pretty. Nice job! 




 Somewhere around $80-90. A bundle or two and a few heroes. 




 * A useful Tyrael trait
* The ability to bind the dismount button to something other than the mount button
* Spectator Mode
* More Diablo heroes 




 Since you're a first-timer, you should call-ahead and let them know you're coming anyway, and that would be a great time to ask. Takes the guess work out of it. 




 His parents knew, early on, that diarrheafarts88 was destined for greatness. 




 First of all, you're a fantastic writer, and I can't wait to see what you're working on next.

My question is, how do you strike the balance between a character doing what would be natural for him/her, and with what you need them to do to further the plot or a particular part of the story? And for that matter, who would you say is more in charge: you or the characters?

Thanks, and keep up the great work! 




 Yeah. Every hero has a trait, which is usually (but not always) a passive ability that helps set them apart. Diablo's soulstones, Nova/Zeratul's cloaking, Kerrigan's shield generation, etc..

Tyrael does have one (I was just being bitter), his explodey angel death bomb, but it's both terrible and practically non-existent. Everyone is begging for Blizzard to replace it with something that actually affects the game, and that doesn't reward Tyrael for doing his job poorly.

As far as buying him, I highly recommend him, as he's both fun and power, though he is somewhat of a challenging hero to play effectively. Unlike Diablo, Muradin, ETC, etc., who can just jump in, push the enemy around, and take a beating, Tyrael requires a a good bit of judgement (plenty of pun intended) to know when to initiate and press an attack. And you really have to be diligent keeping an eye on your back line, since you don't really have a hard disengage.

That said, when you do get a feel for him, you can really punish the enemy for their greed and foolishness. Smart enemies learn very quickly if the Tyrael that they're facing is dangerous and treat him with respect. Weak enemies simply face justice and die.

And that's why I love him. 




 Do you wear a two-piece to go swimming? 




 How about free arena run every time you hit level 60 with a class, so there actually a reason to do it. 




 it's super lucrative.

For the gangs, cartels, and for-profit prisons, maybe. For the rest of us, it's super costly, both in taxes and in lost/destroyed lives. 




 Here's the GDC talk about what they did and the positive effects it had:

http://gdcvault.com/play/1017940/The-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player

Really fascinating stuff. 




 All you do by prematurely declaring a loss is make it more likely to happen. There is no situation where demoralizing your team is a good idea, particularly when you're already down. 




 I'm not. It's really quite easy to stay alive in a lane that's pushed, as you're never far from your towers, and usually behind them. You just soak safely and bring down the wave as fast as you can, weakening it in advanced with ranged AoE, if you can. The towers take minimal damage, you're at almost no risk, and the other lanes have the safety/advantage of large numbers.

This is what the solo lane on haunted mines usually does against 4 enemy heroes. It's particularly annoying when people don't know to do this and you end up 2-3, which puts the group lane down a person (3v1 instead of 4v1), and there's very little difference between a 1v4 and a 2v4, except that the lane doesn't push as hard and you're actually at more risk. 




 Great idea and tips!

When Riot did this, they saw toxicity in league drop noticeably. 




 Tyrael. Total badass. If only he had a hero trait. 




 We're funding both sides of the "war on drugs", and it's super frustrating. 




 You are a good person. 




  The car doesn't support Android Auto

And sadly it sounds like there are no plans to. Though they said that this is because they want to go "another way" with phone integration. We'll see what that means, I suppose. 




 Does he have the authority to do that? 




 I see your point, but I very much disagree that a 2-mana Shield Bearer sucks as much for the mage as a turn 3 Cairne sucks for the opponent. The former is slightly unfortunate, the latter is incredibly powerful. 




 Pretty sure. Maybe he lunges and stands around while he waits for the next auto attack to be ready? 




 I've seen some really outrageous combinations of ranks. One game our team had one 30+, and then something like two 1's, a 3, and an 8, and under, and the other team was all around 15. They're absolutely crazy.

I think the game tries to match based on what it thinks your rank *should* be. Frankly, if they're going to do it that way, they should do it like Starcraft 2 does it. You're in various leagues, bronze through diamond/master, and when the system thinks you're ready to move up, you do. I think if HotS did it this way, you'd settle on a more appropriate rank much quicker, and you'd end up with fewer huge variances in skill/rank.

At the very least I think they should do away with the "skill based" matchmaking and stick with simple rank based matching, at least until they can do a better job determining "skill". 




 Nothing. I was being sarcastic, because the Lollipop update is taking forever (going on 6 months) and they periodically say they're "preparing the update", which doesn't seem to mean anything. 




 This is amazing. I know nothing about tools, machining, engineering, or really anything, but I'm enthralled and have learned already.

Thanks for sharing this! 




 As someone who made the decision to get the 2013 based promises of "fast updates", and is going on 6 months of waiting for Lollipop, I am not. 




 With any luck, they'll be preparing to do the update, for the third time, this week! 




 Nice job!

Auriel is one of the characters that I'm most looking forward to. 




 Buying politicians.  




 I think society's views on nudity are super fucked up. We're taught to be ashamed of our bodies and that nudity is equivalent to sex. Furthermore, the very definition of "nudity" is really confusing. Why is a topless man totally innocent, but a topless woman is something obscene and inherently sexual. And then even going one step further, why is it the nipple, specifically, that is the "dirty part"? And why are we mature about some nudity (locker rooms, the doctor's office, etc.), knowing full well that it isn't sexual, but swimming naked is only something you do on a dare, and if you're caught, you're arrested and labeled a sex offender?

It's all just a bunch of stupid arbitrary rules, some of which are blatantly sexist double standards, based on Victorian prudishness that have caused severe psychological damage on a societal level. That may sound overstated, until you remember that "nip slips" are not only a thing, but there are entire websites built and monetized around them. Or even worse, there are some that consider breastfeeding to be something shameful that must remain hidden. We've latched on to these ridiculous Victorian principals, and the result is infants eating in public restrooms.

Here's another gem of a societal norm: (female) nipples, vaginas, penises, and butts are to be hidden at all time. So if you go swimming, to avoid people looking at them, place a small strip of brightly colored cloth to cover only those areas, specifically the color of those areas, because the shape is anything but concealed once wet. That will surely draw attention away from them, and take the sexuality out of the situation! /s

Swimsuits, like the rest of what we do to "protect" people from nudity, are completely pointless, and counterproductive. If you want to sexualize a pat of the body, make everyone cover it up under all circumstances. That's how you end up with people turned on by bare ankles.

So to answer the question, I think the nudists have it right. If we simply stopped caring about who sees what part of our body, the so-called "private parts" would very quickly lose their fascination, and all of body shame, sexualization of nudity, and all of the other damage caused to society by the prohibition of simple, non-sexual nudity would fade away almost immediately. In other words, we'd act like adults, even without our clothes on.

TL;DR - Swimsuits suck, nudity is only a big deal because we make it one, and the nudists have it right. 




 I guess if you can only see what the person you're spectating sees, that would be fine. No different than having someone else in the room.

I was just thinking that you could see anything, but what you propose is probably better. 




 Yeah, though a 1-2 minute delay is fine and solves the cheating problem. 




 Diablo is very weak early now, but once he hits mid/late game, I actually think he's a lot stronger now. His health pool is massive, like 8.4k, and the new ability at 20 is sweet.

Plus, I really like how he seems to have more viable talents now, as opposed to one really obvious talent at every level.

I like the new ETC, but I didn't play a lot of the old one, so I can't really speculate. I dislike that they've added another death-based ability, though. Speaking as a Tyrael main, I really hate those. 




 I wonder how republicans feel about this. 




 Thanks. 




 How does it work? Did you enable it through the Google app? 




 Doesn't matter. Being restricted to the free heroes is infinitely better than not being able to play at all. 




 Didn't care until I saw this:

When a regions game servers are undergoing maintenance, you may use the Global Play feature to log in to a different region that is not down for maintenance.

Now I care! Awesome! 




 I think it's more accurate to say that Anub was fixed, not buffed. The decreased casting delays are technically more of a buff, but I think the more significant change was that the beetles actually do what they're supposed to, now. 




 YEAH, THAT'S ILLIDAN'S JOB! 




 I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THIS GAME IS GOING TO LAUNCH WITH NO WAY TO UNBIND THE USELESS DISMOUNT BUTTON FROM THE BUTTON THAT DOES THE EXACT OPPOSITE! WHEN I PRESS Z I ALWAYS WANT TO GO FASTER, NEVER SLOWER!

REMOVE THE DISMOUNT BUTTON OR LET US BIND IT TO A DIFFERENT KEY! 




 That mini-gravbomb looks crazy powerful. 




 Thanks 




 What does "backtrain" mean? 




 "Nah." -- republicans 




 These are great and I can't wait for the specialists one! 




 Yup. She destroyed us single-handedly. 




 It's not live in the US yet? 




 Nope. NA. 




 It's gotta be a bug. She's surviving 1v4s. 




 The state shouldn't murder people. Especially innocent people.  




 Stupid things like "went to pot", " to boot", etc., that don't really make sense but people keep using them.  




  Bill Richards urged the jury to not pursue the death penalty.

If not for the victims, it makes you wonder who we're imposing the death penalty on behalf of.

And, of course, the answer is "pro life" republicans. 




 WHY IS THE DISMOUNT BUTTON STILL A THING! IT SERVES NO PURPOSE! REMOVE IT OR LET US MOVE IT TO SOMETHING THAT ISN'T ALSO THE MOUNT BUTTON!! 




 Brilliant! 




 Agreed. I wish they were in a more easily viewable location, as well. It can be unsafe to sneak a peak down at the corner of the screen in many situations, especially for those of us with large displays. 




 Definitely feeling the loss of the rockstar timer. 




 Armageddon and Deep Impact. 

In the summer of 1997, an asteroid threatens to end life as we know it. Can a specialized team plant a nuclear weapon below the surface of the killer rock before it's too late? And then can they do it again? 




 I know. I mean, maybe a Squirt machine... 




 I love it, too, though I'm still getting used to it. I still have moments where I'm like "C'mon, Stunned! Don't just stand there!" 




 There are dozens of us. Dozens! 




 Perhaps. I don't remember the exact circumstances, but I was pretty sure that she hadn't done anything like that. 




 Maybe. Haven't had any issues with latency lately, but perhaps. 




 Speaking on behalf of all of the Tyrael mains, please fix the trait before Sanctification. I know Sanctification isn't picked, but we're all stuck with Archangel's Wrath.

Judgement could also use some fixing, too. It often hits the wrong target, and the misfires at max range or when the target goes out of sight are incredibly frustrating. It's a fantastic ult, but missing a brief, but important, window to use it because it's so clumsy is really painful.

We know his win rate is high, and we don't disagree that he's a great warrior (and a total bad ass), but we could really use a few quality of life upgrades (and an actual trait) to make him a little smoother to play.

Thanks! 




 Actually they were about 20 minutes early with the last patch, I believe. 




 Fair enough. Thanks. 




  potentially his level 20 breath upgrade

You actually take that? The shield was incredibly powerful, and even if the new ability didn't look great (which it does), I'd take bolt over both of the ult upgrades.

I don't really think breath range or duration are all that useful, particularly the latter. Care to change my mind? 




  The new death metal seems terrible. ETC is really easy to keep alive. You typically have enough move speed, escapes and sustain to never die unless you want to. You essentially have to waste your level 20 talent to get an ability that makes you WANT to suicide. So not only are you now having to choose to kill yourself, but waste a talent getting that privilege. Also im assuming it will have the same wind up animation as normal mosh pit, AND you will [probably be a different ghost color, making it super obvious for people to GTFO, so most likely it will never hit anyone anyways.

As a Tyrael main, all I can say is be grateful that this is a talent, not your trait. 




 I don't know how powerful he'll be, but I really like this rework, because it seems like he has many more viable and fewer undeniable talents now. I can see making a decision at every level, instead of just picking "the right one".

One of my favorite things about playing Jaina is that I never build her the same way twice, and I can see this new Diablo potentially possessing that same level of viable variability. 




  The hope is that the release will eventually increase the pool of players to allow you to have an enjoyable casual 5 stack.

Don't see how. Anyone that wants to play already can. Not sure where this whole other population of players will come from.

I hope I'm wrong, because matchmaking is a nightmare right now. 




 Fantastic idea! 




 Glad of this, too. Hope to see this continuing in the future. Even earlier, preferably. Once the game is down for the patch, I don't see a  reason to delay publishing the patch notes. 




 I was really expecting a back-door Abathur. None in game. Well done! 




 There are two issues:

1. Tyrael will very often switch the target of judgement to another enemy (minions and mercs included). So you'll select Zeratul and it'll be ETC that gets hit with the primary effect.
2. Not technically a bug, but Tyrael will cancel judgement mid wind-up if the target goes out of range or sight. So you use the ability on a target in range, Tyrael stops moving, dismounts, shouts "embrace judgement!", and then does nothing. It's incredibly frustrating, and it makes the ability extremely difficult to use effectively at max range or near bushes. 




 I love the changes to Diablo. I can't say how it will affect how powerful he is, but now each level has several very compelling choices, rather than one obvious choice for 90% of the time. One of my favorite things about Jaina is that I build her differently each game, because almost all of her talents are viable, and I can definitely see this new Diablo being another hero like that.

Really super sad that Tyrael's trait and Judgement's bugs haven't been addressed, though. That's always the first thing I look for in each patch. 




 And is there a patent on the antidote? If there's nothing proprietary, what's stopping your competitor from making the same antidote and crushing you like the cockroach that you are?

Also, the police. 




 Agreed. I feel like it's possible for someone to be in a rank that isn't commensurate with their actual skill level, but I think that that's something that will self-correct over time. Until they can devise a way to realistically and accurately assess skill, I think that that's the best that you can really do. 




 I wonder about this, too. It seems pretty simple to me, especially because the matchmaking takes place before hero selection.

I think they try and match based on "skill", not rank, but frankly I don't think that there's really an effective way to programatically determine skill. Obviously Blizzard disagrees, but the result is not all that convincing. 




 WHAM! 




 Yup. True story. 




 Yeah, I definitely agree they shouldn't try and cram a hero into one of those roles for that, or any other, reason. 




  I'm more of the stance that they should design what works best for the character, without worrying about getting every category filled.

I can respect that, but we're really only talking about 2 more heroes. Not that they should make a character a warrior/support for this reason, but they should priorities a Starcraft support and a Dialo support. Push Fenix and Deckard, the monk, or some supporty angel (Auriel maybe) up in the pipeline and then it's done. 




 As much as I'd like her to be a support, I think there's almost no chance of it. She screams warrior. 




 Interesting how the legendary tint is the second one. 




 My bad. 




 Contact support. They'll help you pinpoint the issue. 
























 I don't know, this is the first time I've heard anybody say "I like him but he'll lose" in a while. I think his supporters pre-maturely declaring defeat for him was a very big hurdle, and I think he's pretty much overcome it. 




 Have we done a promotional post in /r/SandersForPresident or any of the other relevant subs? I know I'd have subscribed a while ago, but just found the sub today. 




 Is it really fair to count Santorum himself? 




 Do you ask that question of gas station price signs, too?

 I usually base it on positioning and mobility. If you're a "slower character" (e.g. hammer, brightwing, rehgar), or if I'm between you and your base, you're getting kicked. Otherwise, it's whoever is being the most annoying. 




 Here's [a video version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kEpZWGgJks) instead! 




 Republicans can get away with that because old people (their base) vote and young people (their opponents' base) don't. That's why the country is significantly more liberal than the government. 




 That's you asking someone to do that for you. It's not an established, widespread industry of pushers. 




 Is that how it worked when alcohol became legalized? Do you know many alcohol dealers selling beer to kids on street corners? 




 So vote Sanders? Got it. 




 /r/gogopgo 




 The difference is that everyone is saying that Bernie is only in it to pull Hillary to the left. He's saying that that's not true. He's in it to win.

Nobody doubts that all of the republicans are fighting to get to the top of the crazy pile. 




 The problem is, that base actually votes. 




 Same. 




 Ah, good. It sucks when people do this, I'm glad that there's significant discouragement.

Thanks! 




 I very strongly disagree with this:

 its going to cause youths to smoke it more since its been legitimized by the government.

Besides the fact that that's a pretty illogical statement (legalization might lessen the stigma, but it certainly won't *cause* anyone to use), the reverse will undoubtedly be true. Weed, at the moment, is essentially entirely unregulated, and many kids choose weed over beer because it's easier to get.

CVS isn't going to sell to a minor, but dealers have zero problem with it. Make pot legal and you get rid of most of the dealers. 




 /r/gogopgo 




 And, amazingly, it works :( 




 /r/gogopgo 




 This is super fun and effective (you wouldn't believe some of the escapes I've had doing this), but it doesn't explain the necessity for Tyrael to pause while throwing the sword. 




 Proposed Tyrael trait alternative:

**Archangel's Timeliness**

El'Druin's Might shows how much time remains for Tyrael to teleport.

You can't deny that that'd be a hell of a lot more useful than Archangel's Wrath. 




 First sentence:

Following comments Donald Trump made about Mexican immigrants during his presidential announcement last week,

There's also this:

"When do we beat Mexico at the border?" Trump said during his lengthy presidential announcement speech at Trump Tower in New York. "They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."

And this:

Trump's comments are just the type the Republican Party has been looking to avoid. The Republican National Committee underwent serious self-reflection following President Obama's re-election, initiating an "autopsy" of what went wrong. It determined it had to reach out to minorities to strike a more inclusive tone.

And this:

The controversy seems unlikely to fade, especially now that Trump is an official candidate for president. With his high name recognition, he places highly in many polls and is likely to be included in the first two Republican presidential debates scheduled for August.

This entire article is about a US presidential candidate making several highly offensive comments during his announcement that he is running for president, and a major media corporation severing ties due to the nature of those comments, as well as the impact that it has on said candidate's party.

How is that not about current American politics? 




 /r/gogopgo 




 We're gonna win this thing. And then the other thing! 




 /r/gogopgo 




 They've been in a severe downward spiral for a while now. I unfollowed them from my Facebook stream them a while back. This has earned them the full unlike. 




 Very well put! 




 I know. Better late than never, but 2015 was a really freaking long time to wait for marriage equality. 




 I think we'll just have to agree to disagree.

For what it's worth, I'm a huge supporter of both gay rights and Bernie, so I'm glad that this has visibility. 




 If only the title were better. 




 It's not that it's not relevant. It's just counter to the campaign that Bernie is trying to run. I think if you asked him, he wouldn't want to see things like this posted here. 




 I guess my issue is it being posted here. Post it in /r/politics, /r/hillaryclinton, /r/lgbt, etc.. It doesn't really have anything to do with Bernie, and Bernie seems entirely uninterested (and unwilling) to discuss the positions of his opponents, let alone highlight something negative. 




 /r/mildlyinteresting 




 This doesn't belong here. Bernie repeatedly refuses to go negative, and so should we. 




 You'd think, but I think people see it as superfluous. 




 And we haven't even gotten the marriage equality win yet! 




  Hope we continue in the left direction.

FTFY ;) 




 Interesting. I wonder how many would vote for a democratic socialist, since Sanders is not a socialist. 




 Ha! 




 I agree. 




 Thank you. It helps a bit to know that vestibular rehab isn't 100% verified to work, though I would still think that someone would have brought it up as a possibility along the way. 5 years is a long time to try nothing.

I don't recall what the first ENT did, this was like 8 years ago, but as far as I can remember, the most we got out of anyone was "That sucks. Good luck!" So probably nothing. 




 Thank you. 




 Agreed on all counts! 




 Really his biggest hurdle is his own would-be supporters pre-declaring defeat for him. I know that's not what you're saying here, but the most common thing I hear about him is "Yeah, he's the ideal candidate and he'd make a great president, but he can't win", and I think a lot of people say that because a lot of other people say it. 




 Really? You think he needs a wig? 




 That's fine in theory, but it's not what happens in practice. We desperately need to replace the dysfunctional FPTP system. The good news is that we've begun to. RCV is growing around the country. 




 In unrelated news, McDonald's is looking for a new meat supplier. 




 The dismount button should be able to be moved to a different button than the mount button. 




 Sad, true, and frustration. 




 Good for you for getting involved a such a young age, though. We need more young people taking an interest in politics and government. The government is sadly far more conservative than the people, because old people vote and young people don't. 




 [I quite agree.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo list=PL-cJs8aiZ912jQj_X1i91gvc1gbkCc0FD) 




 Weird. Sorry you had that experience, especially since you've already donated.

Try it in incognito mode. Maybe the fact that you've already donated is causing the problem. 




 This is fun, and I would play the hell out of it, if it counted towards golden hero wins. Sadly, though, I'm probably just going to keep grinding ranked wins to hopefully get my first golden hero by the end of the year. Chances aren't great.

 Even when he's supporting libertarian positions? You don't think that's relevant to libertarians? 




 Thank you. 




 We should not decriminalize theft and burglary. That's absurd.

Yes, we should decriminalize prostitution. 




 The answer is treating it like a medical problem, not a legal one. You're right, prevention is the key, and locking people up is not preventing anything. It's only making them more desperate, giving them fewer options, and surrounding them with more criminals.

TL;DR - Decriminalization. 




 Not really sure how debates are bad for the people, I would argue that the opposite is true, but I definitely agree that they're good for Bernie.  




 I consider the legalization of marijuana to be a libertarian issue, so I post things related to it here. Sorry if you feel it's off topic. 




 I'm down for everything except for the "instead" part. I like being able to see how long until the next one starts.

Other than that, I agree! 




 It's probably a sticker. 




 The first one should be free, and then it's $15 for another 3.

My first one was free. 




 I think I might be done with the PTR:

* No progression
* No talents
* No new hero
* Lots of lag
* 75% chance of playing a map I could play on the regular server that doesn't suffer from those other problems

Might be a different story if there was more to test or if there wasn't such horrendous lag (I never lag on the real servers). 




  Do you have TWC?

Thankfully no. I live in one of the few places in the US where I've got a second ISP to choose from.

 Nope. NA.

 Really, the amount of total actions take in a game is small enough that I think it's reasonable to expect every game to be saved for replay. 




 3 questions:

1. Would it be reversable?
2. Would it work for astigmatisms?
3. Would I feel it in my eye long term? 




 More to the point, who isn't yesterday? 




 The GOP: the party of small government, personal liberty, and free markets. /s 




 I'd love one, if you still have one. 




 ELI5 the difference? 




 That's why I'm a big fan of early voting. Makes it a lot easier for people to get out to vote if they have options and more than one day to do it.

I'm excited to see online voter registration becoming more prevalent, too. 




 Old people vote, young people don't. That's the sad reality that has made this happen. 




 I don't see what's wrong with Title + quote, as long as the end result is still representative of the article.

I think something is being lost here. 




 And surviving teammates, please, PLEASE act as though you're down a hero. Because you are. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a teammate die, followed by one of my other teammates starting (yes, starting) a team fight with the 5 enemies that just got the kill.

Repeat after me:

By Grapthar's Hammer, you shall be amazed at how I wisely fall back and safely soak/defend by (preferably behind) our towers until our team is no longer at a significant disadvantage!

Of course you can't just give the enemy full map control every time one of your teammates goes down, but you do have to acknowledge their advantage and play accordingly. If the enemy is up 2-3 heroes, they're going to take a boss, your mercs, a fort, etc.. That's their reward, let them have it, and don't add to it if you can't deny them safely and sensibly.

TL;DR - Don't get dead, too. 




 /r/gogopgo 




  It was never brought up again.

Why not? Did he cancel Cinemax? 




 Might be if we can get his supporters to stop preemptively declaring defeat. He's rocketing up in the polls, but the pessimism is as thick as ever. 




 I am absolutely convinced that there is no greater mistake you can make than attacking your own teammates. There's absolutely no point to it, it causes a lot of damage, and it's incredibly easy to avoid (step only: don't do it). 




 Then if you don't mind a suggestion, stop saying that it won't happen. If you're right, then it won't have changed anything, but by trying to declare defeat for him early, all you're really doing is making it more likely. There's no upside to it.

He's got quite an uphill battle, and one of the major hurtles is the fact that everyone keeps saying that he can't win, because everyone keeps saying that he can't win. It's really amazing how much progress that he's making, and at how fast he's closing the gap, given the fact that even his own supporters are trying to convince everyone that he won't win.

Let the guy win. 




  It's not going to happen.

Unless it does. 




  Shouldn't Clinton be answering those instead of blacking out the media.

I love that that's always his response, too. "I'll let her state her position on that." Every single time.

He could easily smear or attack her. He doesn't. "Ask her, don't ask me".

Please elect this man. We need him. 




 Dude directly and succinctly answers every single question that doesn't involve smearing his opponent.

[berniesanders.com](http://www.berniesanders.com), let's get this guy elected! 




 Politicians who are consistent to and clearly state their beliefs make me cringe, too. It's especially cringeworthy when they directly and succinctly answer every question that doesn't involve smearing their opponent.

Good call. 




 I think that this is a good suggestion. I also think that the card would be just fine as is for 7 mana. 




 The article refers to homicides, not gun deaths. 




 Just call and ask. 




 I don't know. I think a minimum wage with basic income is kind of redundant, as well as unnecessary. If people no longer have to work to survive, they can be more selective, and a market-driven fair price should surface.

In theory, anyway. 




 My first thought, too. Even taking the fact that the child was shot out of the equation, I'm willing to bet that the circumstances under which the dog was shot at would have been enough to land a civilian in jail.

We really need to stop this "shoot first, ask questions later" approach to law enforcement (which this wasn't even). 




 Thank you! 




 Oh man, an entire realm to test Tyrael's trait (which they're surely not going to go another patch without addressing)? That's great! It must be big. Big and not requiring Tyrael to die to use it.

Assumptions! 




 Mind ELI5'ing SB5 and how we told him to shove it up his ass? 




 I've always wondered about this as well. You'd think they'd be against a frivolous law that arbitrarily increases the number of criminals and arrests (and thus potentially violent confrontations). You'd also think that the decrease in alcohol consumption would be appealing to them, since drunk people tend to be a lot more out of control than high people (who are generally mellow and happy). 




 We really need to start calling him "The Sand Viper". 




 /r/gogopgo 




 His last name is **Sand**ers... 




 Great (and amusing) write-up. I agree with just about everything, especially this:

it's a shit trait with shit mechanics that rewards shit play and should be shitkicked into a shitpile located...

this:

I would like to see the persistent range check removed. If I am in range to start it up, barring a hearth it should go off.

and this:

TL;DR I love Tyrael. Let me love him more.

 The only thing that I disagree with is that I typically take Angelic Absorption at 13. Am I missing out here? 




 The decriminalization measure, which cleared the House earlier this month, passed despite significant opposition from police groups and Republicans.

 It seems I have officially passed the Turing Test. 




 That's different from what OP experienced. Rage guy was upset that OP picked Azmodan period. Not because of some counter or comp issue. 




 Yeah, but usually if your tank is down it doesn't matter much. You'd be much better off if your tank had a trait that helped keep him alive. 




 Just sharing things where appropriate. 




 I think we can expand this:

If you lost a game when you were on a team with an Azmo, it's typically not because you had an Azmo.

To something a little more broad:

If you think you lost a game because you were on a team with a specific hero, it's typically not because of you were on a team with that hero. It's more likely that you're just bad. 




 Depends on the sub, but regardless, it's generally a good practice. I try not to editorialize my titles. 




 This. I main Tyrael and 95% of the games that I play it does absolutely nothing, and the remaining 5% of the time it almost never results in an actual kill or significant impact on a fight. It's just terrible.

I suppose I could die more often to get more mileage out of it, but I'd rather they just give him an actual, useful trait. 




 That's the article's title... 




 It's not even Christianity. It's a couple lines in the old testament.

100% guarantee Jesus would support gay rights today. He was incredibly liberal and accepting, based on everything that he says in The Bible. He'd be pretty appalled that ignorant and intolerant people use His name to discriminate against others.

I really don't get why the right is considered the party of Christianity, other than the fact that they try and legislate out of the bible (the limited parts of it that they key in on). Their platform of greed, intolerance, judgement, and hate is pretty counter to everything that Jesus said and stood for.

 I love the idea of a Colossus specialist! They were my favorite unit in SC2. Really powerful, but very fragile.

 The Vikings are an example of Blizzard looking beyond the cross-promotional benefits of releasing heroes from actively marketed games, so I think that D2 heroes are a real possibility. 




  Actually, I'd legit love for Heroes of the Storm to bring in characters from other companies games. Get Ryu from Street Fighter in there (he will be in ANYTHING, and would be easy to add, fireball, dragon punch, hurricane kick)

Sorry, but this would be horrible. Honestly, I think that's the worst part about Smash Brothers, and I would hate to see that happen to Heroes. 




 Sign me up! 




 I don't think things like Nova's Amazon skin precludes the possibility of an Amazon hero. Don't forget, Valla essentially has a Tyrael skin. 




  Republicans use religion when it's convenient.

FTFY 




 It is kind of ridiculous that since I own Jaina, if I buy the Jaina skin bundle, I'm effectively just buying the winter skin for more money than if I just bought it without the bundle. 




  They want it to be presented in better ways than just icons at the bottom of the screen which they feel wasn't good enough.

That makes sense, but what doesn't make sense is removing them until said better solution is in place. Even if they weren't ideal, the old icons were better than nothing.

That said, I'm sure there was a technical reason for doing so. 




 Couldn't agree more.

 I meant starting with Johanna's release. I worded it poorly. 




  i wonder if we will get wizard as well

I really hope so. Would love to see alternative Diablo heroes as well, such as a male frenzy barb. 




 Right? He looks absolutely amazing. That's a 15k hero right there. 




 One of the things that I love about this game is that the supports can still do considerable damage. 




 Johanna's super fun, and Leoric looks amazing. Excited to see what comes up the monk, as well. 




 [Or is it...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HMeW2hg6Hc) 




 He tweeted 4 hours ago, so yeah, seems so. 




 This is my concern as well. Someone doesn't show up to goblins and it leads to resentment. 




 Is he gone? 




 I think this might be an idea to address that. 




 I think you might have missed the point. 




 /r/gogopgo 




 Johanna. I meant a span of 9 weeks, starting with her. 




 No, it's a known issue. 




 I main Tyrael, so I use Judgement a lot (often unsuccessfully). 




 Auriel and Malthiel are at the top of my list of wants. 




 Pylo! 




 No argument here! A ranged warrior sounds awesome. 




  Crossing my fingers for a Starcraft themed map and heroes.

Yeah, thought about saying something like that in my post, but didn't want to push our luck :P. I think the Diablo characters are the coolest and most interesting, but Starcraft is definitely my favorite of the three universes, and I'd love to see more protoss and zerg enter the mix, especially a zealot. 




 We also need to get our people to stop saying "he can't win, don't bother". I think that's his biggest obstacle. 




 I just think if I use the ability within range, it should fire The way it is now it seems like this is the flow:

1. Check if target is in range.
2. Dismount, stop moving, and say "Embrace Judgement".
3. Check if target is in range.
4. Fire.

If the target was in range when I cast it, the ability should fire. Otherwise, the ability's max range is effectively lower than it appears. It sucks having to get closer than max range to actually use the ability.

Really the other issue is the bigger one, though. Countless times (including twice yesterday) I'll click on one enemy and Tyrael will charge another. Drives me nuts, especially because it's often a full health warrior that gets hit instead of the 10% health assassin that I clicked on.

EDIT: Also, your username is cool and very Rehgarish. 




 Thanks. Missed that. 




 Don't forget gang violence and cartel activities (trafficking other drugs, guns, people, etc.). Certainly helps fund those things as well. 




 Probably has something to do with the site's metadata. 




 The evidence suggests both. 




 Thank you for doing this. 




 I sure hope so. Auriel is towards the top of my list of heroes that I want to see. Really member any of the angiris council would be awesome. 




  It would decrease the afkers at map start thats for sure :)

No more loading screen redditing for this guy! 




  Reddit is VERY far left of America as whole,

That may be (at least partially) true, but something to consider is that America is also significantly more liberal than the government, due to the fact that old people vote and young people don't. 




 I don't see a priest buff. What am I missing? 




 Tyrael. 




 Judgement is very buggy. It often hits the wrong target, and if you use it at max range and the enemy moves even slightly farther away, it misfires. 




 That's a conservative estimate. I was thinking at least 15.

 If you don't want to see articles about US politics, you might not want to hang out in /r/uspolitics. 




 That's some solid analysis right there. 




  The taxes are on cigarettes and sales which everyone, rich or poor, will have to pay. The progressive writer who produced this garbage of course will conclude it as an assault against the poor.

You really don't see how a tax like that has a greater impact on the poor? 




 That is a [systemic problem \(video\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo list=PL-cJs8aiZ912jQj_X1i91gvc1gbkCc0FD). 




 This shouldn't even be allowed. I think a lot more discussion would take place about hero selection if people weren't afraid of prejudice due to rank. 




 Bah. I always do that. Thanks for the heads up. 




 I like this change. 




 Think about how much time, money, gas, and road wear this will save over the years.

 That's like 5 BM's:

1. "Sorry"
2. Frostshocks own minion.
3. "Sorry"
4. "Sorry"
5. Makes opponent wait before finishing him.

Used to have respect for Ratsmah. That kind of took a hit here, and I was definitely hoping he would end up losing due to his dickery. 




  update with what I learn.

Please do. Would love to hear. 




 I know. Wish I could do something about that :( 




 Not sure about that. I don't think the text changed at all (correct me if I'm wrong). It just had a limited number of demons that it could summon, and now it can summon practically all of them. I would say that that's the original functionality and intention of the card. 




 I wouldn't call that a buff. It was more like a fix. 




 If you hate Tyrael, the game is doing you a favor. He's amazing, but requires some practice and a very solid understanding of the game. Give him a shot! 




 In order:

* Sky Temple
* Dragonshire
* Tomb of the Spider Queen
* Blackheart's Bay
* Cursed Hollow
* Haunted Mines
* Garden of Terror

Love the first 3, hate the bottom 2. 




 Yeah, but with nova's amazing wave clear and structure damage, she should be able to clear out the fort before the tribute even spawns. 




 I meant it's not going to disincentive people from working. Nobody is going to consider that enough. 




 Supports yes. Healers, not necessary. 




  There will fewer options because people at the bottom won't challenge the people above them.

This is the part that I really disagree with. $12,000 per year isn't going to disincentive anyone. Nobody's ambition ends with "not starving". I really think you'll see a large productivity increase, because people will be doing the work that they choose, not that they need to survive.

Really, though, at the end of the day, the most compelling reason for basic income is the fact that automation and efficiency are crushing jobs, and will continue to do so at an accelerated rate. They're going to increase the already growing wealth gap, and we're simply not going to have enough jobs for people. Moreover, with 99% of all new wealth headed straight to the 1%, we're going to find that it would be in everyone's best interest (the ultra rich included) for that money to circulate, rather than to accumulate. Basic income solves both of those problems. 




 As a heroes player, well done!

As a Tyrael main, fuck you. 




 Drives me crazy when a tribute is announced near the bottom, and top lane sits there for 30 seconds and THEN comes down. Even if you get there exactly as the fight starts (which is unlikely), you've put your team at a significant disadvantage, as the enemy has had the chance to position themselves favorably. Chances are, though, if you're coming that late that at least one of your teammates will be dead by the time you get there.

Be where the fight is, and please, get there early. 




  Of course it's your fault when he dies.

Every time. 




  So now the government is paying for people to be with their families?

The government is guaranteeing that, no matter the circumstances, every one of its citizens has enough to ensure their basic needs of survival. How they choose to spend their extra time is up to them. For 99.99999%, this will undoubtedly be working. They'll simply have more options as to what that means. 




 Almost nobody would stop working. Many would do different things, but very few people would be content to live on $12,000 per year. The poor, especially, would continue working, as they've got more incentive to do so (since they're, well, poor).

Personally i expect Americans to just pocket the money and make more money.

Yup. That's the idea. Though with the added buffer and safety net, they're be more likely to seek out work that they enjoy or are more suited towards. Some might even drop down to part time to spend more time on their families, or doing things that they find valuable, but might not be all that profitable (charity, art, community development, etc.). 

















































 This advice will take you straight to rank 1:

You can take the enemy straight to the mid core. As long as your top and bot are being narced by a tank and a healerrespectively. 




 He reminds me of Kerrigan with stronger 1v1 and weaker ults. Insane duelist but very awkward in a team fight.

Basically, he's going to kill you, unless something kills him first. 

































































































































 The dude took her 45% Iowa lead to 19% in 2 months, has received donations from 5 times as many people as Hillary, and can't find a venue large enough to hold all of his supporters. And yeah, she's got more money but he's running a much leaner, grass roots campaign. Really the only thing she has on him is billionaires, and with the type of campaign that he's running, that might not even be much of an issue.

Don't count him out yet. 




 How fast do your private police and firemen respond, and what does your premium cost? 




 As an American, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren seem like two great politicians and a breath of fresh air.

 




  I wish there were more candidates with his integrity.

FTFY. We need more people like him on both/all sides of the isle. 




 Thanks for posting this!

I think [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries,_2016) might be a better link for primary election dates, though. Unless I'm mistaken, the one you linked only hast the dates from 2012. 




 For the people, *by* the people. 




 The fact that you think that a few lines in The Old Testament account for "everything that God says", while disregarding practically everything that Jesus says, tells me that I probably shouldn't even be responding to you... 




 I'd imagine that's why he's running in the primary... 




 What would you say those faults are? What makes him the "least awful" as opposed to "the best"? 




 He's technically a "democratic socialist". It's probably more fair to say that he's a populist more than a socialist.

It's kind of nuanced, so if you want to know what he believes, this interview covers his positions really well:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpgJYNaIeqo 




 People are excited about a good, honest man with a real shot of becoming president.

That doesn't really happen all that often. 




  He's obviously going to raise taxes like crazy to pay for these ridiculous programs - he just hasn't been pushed to admit it yet.

He "admits" it constantly. If you've ever heard him speak, he repeatedly says he's going to raise taxes on super rich to help the 99%.

His response to pretty much anything he's ever been asked is one of the following:

* We need to raise taxes on the rich.
* If you want to know Hillary's position on that, don't ask me, ask her.

[Observe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpgJYNaIeqo) 




 Found this on /r/RepublicansForSanders. 




 This is the first time that I've considered a write-in as well. I always wondered what the point was. Now I know. 




 I agree, and your username is awesome. 









 Is the issue the "Republicans for Bernie - Republicans for Bernie"? Honestly just a copy and paste mistake, but I'd like to know for when I repost it. 




 Only if you disagree with him. This interview gives you some good insight into his positions:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpgJYNaIeqo 




 That's probably why nobody's saying that. 

















































  EDIT: Ugh, give your $3.99 to Bernie. No one should be giving anyone gold on this subreddit, donate it to the campaign instead and tell the OP a "hey I donated $3.99 on your behalf."

hey I donated $10.00 on your behalf ;)

I wasn't the one that gilded you, just to be clear. 




  Please. The House isn't switching before the 2020 census, when districts get redrawn, at the earliest. The Senate, if the candidate has some coat tails, can flip.

That's fair. 










































































 Or the best. 




 If enough people show up to elect Bernie, they'll almost definitely also put a congress that'll work with him in place. The reason that the people are much more liberal than the government is that old people vote and young people don't. But Bernie definitely has enough young people fired up that they'd actually show up on election day.

 Welcome! Very glad to have you aboard.

Mind sharing your feelings on why you switched? I'm particularly interested to hear which issues were most significant for you, and why you feel Bernie's stance on them is a better fit for you (and America).

Thanks. 




 Agreed on all points. I wish Sanders would be more vocal about it, though. I wonder if he's trying to show campaign platform restraint by not running on too many things. It's the only reason I can think of why he's not speaking out for more for legalization. 




 Depends on your perspective. Here's [my opinion](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3brr5m/bernie_sanders_is_an_american_politician_who_has/csp4ek0). 




  You seriously think that less than 1% of the public would quit working, if they were able to make as much or more than they do now but without working?

I think exactly that, yes. 




 I disagree. I'm rather confident that 99% of the population would agree that $12k per year is not enough, and would work towards more. 









 Believe it or not, paying people to do nothing is a large and immediate disincentive.

If someone guaranteed you a paycheck of $1,000 per month, you wouldn't quit your job and do nothing, and neither would 99% of the rest of the population. 






















































 Yeah, for this to work in the US it'd have to be something like $800 to $1,500 per month, similar to [what they're trying in The Netherlands](http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2015/07/01/3676097/utrecht-universal-basic-income/). 




 It's a good thing basic income doesn't disincentivize productivity, then. In fact, it's been shown to increase productivity. 




 You can still advertise your meeting. Just duplicate the /r/Dayton post in this sub (and don't ask for upvotes). 




 Worked for me. Got the same message and restarted twice. I got in on the third try.

 Yeah, I found them incredibly mundane as well.

 That looks fantastic! Nicely done. 




 I was about 20 minutes into a game yesterday before realizing that I didn't have Prog Rock. They moved it and I just looked at the icon, not the text.

On the plus side, I had plenty of mana! 




  It's funny how the ragers always are the worst players on a team, without exception.

 They're supposedly re-editing it to be chronological. I'll probably give it another try then, but I gotta say, I am not looking forward to it. 




 He just keeps outdoing himself. #FeelTheBern 






















































 That's odd. Why would they go straight from 3 to 5? That'd be like making an Indiana Jones 5...

If anyone needs me, I'll be in denial. 




 I'm like 10 episodes in. I just can't stomach anymore. It stretched everything out way too long, it wasn't funny, and it wasn't Arrested Development.

If 10 of 15 episodes isn't enough to get an idea of the season, I guess I'm just missing out. 




 This interview sums it up rather nicely:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpgJYNaIeqo 




 Integrity. It costs. 




 It is a good thing when the norm of your profession is to use/abuse it for personal gain, not to mention that it's a lot easier to represent people when you understand the lives that they lead. 




 Ha, I totally didn't notice that. Good catch. 




 Here's a great interview:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpgJYNaIeqo

Or if you just want to get pumped, here's 3 minutes of moving remarks:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtBVuye4fZQ 




 Thank you for posting this. I think it's very important. Bernie is running a positive campaign, and I think we, as a sub, should emulate that. 




 Yeah, wish I could go :( 









 It's actually very significant.

It shows that in a time when people consider politicians to be greedy and entirely self serving, Sanders hasn't used very powerful position for personal gain. By politician standards (especially by senator standards), he's downright poor.

It also shows that while most politicians are very much out of touch with the lives of ordinary people, Bernie's modest lifestyle shows that he knows exactly what the lives of his constituents are really like.

Looking at all of his extremely populist positions, it's obvious that he's for the people, but this demonstrates that he is also *of* the people. 




 Oh, I was looking [here](http://www.heroesnexus.com/heroes/26-brightwing). Must not be updated. 









 I can't make this one, but I think it's wise to keep the date as is. We can add another one at a later date if there's enough interest. 




 I can't make it on the 11th (family plans) but I'd definitely be interested in future meetups.

Thanks for organizing this! 




 West Chester here. I'd be interested! 





























 Me too. I went digging for it after I saw that he reported $200k in income this year. I thought for sure he'd have at least a few million to his name, since he's been a senator for so long. Nope. Practically poor in politician terms.

The guy is not only for the people, he's *of* the people. 









 I haven't played the new BW yet. How do you give an ally spell shield? 




 Also, let us toggle the mount on and off on the play screen, too, so we can get a better idea what our skin/tint/mount combo looks like. 




 Yeah, though I get that impression just listening to the guy speak. He's nothing short of incredible. 




 Add an extra space between each one if you want them on individual lines. Or use bullet points.

Thanks for adding this! 




 I don't think it's ridiculous to get excited the possibility that a great man with unchanging convictions who cares about and prioritizes the needs of the people becoming the president of the united states.

I don't find anything ridiculous about that at all. 




 I think he's got a real chance, especially because cries like this have lessened dramatically. Just a few weeks ago you'd hear "He's amazing but he'll never win!" dozens of times per day. This is only the second time that I've heard it in probably over a week.

Overcoming that was a really major hurdle, and he got past it pretty quickly. He's flying up in the polls (they look better every day), he's getting insane turnouts at his rallies, he's raising good amounts of money (from people, not corporations or SuperPACs), and most importantly, he's clearly the best person for the job.

I think we're actually going to win this thing. And by "we" I mean America. 




 2,577 Chicago Police Hours Spent on Cannabis Arrests Just in the Last 30 Wasted

Much better. 




 He uses them every match. Or do you think he could look like a ridiculous, whimsical owl without them? 




 Only the government. The American people are actually much more liberal than the government, but old people vote and young people don't, so we end up with representatives that are significantly more conservative than those they're (supposed to be) representing. 































































































































































 Vote for you whom you want to win the primary. It's not really important that the winner of the primary win by one extra vote, but it is important that we select the best candidate.

That's my opinion, anyway. 




 Keep your eye on Maine. They're voting to institute it statewide next year. It's also already in place in more than a few places around the country, and in those places negative campaigning has fallen dramatically.

I think we'll get it, eventually, especially as more people become aware of it. 



































































































 Better unbelievably late than never.

Kinda. 

























































































 It's like, pick an unkillable hero that deals almost no damage already, guy! 















































































 Updated my previous comment after calling to verify my own registration status. 












































 It's the number of people who have donated to his campaign so far. He's gotten 400,000 donations from 250,000 different people, with an average of about $33 per donation (totally to $15 million).

To put that into perspective, Hillary has gotten donations from about 50,000 people so far (for this cycle), and at the same time in the 2008 cycle, Obama (who as we all know defeated Hillary) had donations from about 180,000 people.

TL;DR - Bernie has about 5 times more support from the 99% than Hillary, and he's even significantly outperforming Obama's 2008 campaign (with every day people). Hillary has the billionaires locked up, but Bernie's campaign runs on more than money. 




 I think most states require you to be registered with a party to vote in that party's primary. So as a registered republican, you could vote for Bernie in the general election if he gets the democratic nomination, but unless your state has open primaries, you couldn't vote for him in the democratic primary. You'd need to register as a democrat, first.

UPDATE: I just called my county board of elections, and for my state at least, it sounds like you declare your party affiliation by voting in that party's primary (which is what I think you were suggesting). So you just show up and ask for a party's ticket, and then you become registered with that party by voting in their primary. I'd still verify for your county/state. Sorry for any confusion. 




 Glad to hear it! He really does seem to be uniting people, all across the political spectrum.

If you don't mind me asking, are you planning on registering as a democrat to vote for him in the primary? 




 Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're saying, but he isn't campaigning in Florida yet. He wasn't at that event. That was just 80 people getting together to talk Bernie and what they could do to help his campaign.  




 Probably because you're confusing a local, volunteer organized gathering with an official campaign event. 









 How about the endorsement of 250,000 Americans? Is that important enough for you? 
























































































































































































 It shows growing support for an underdog candidate that people used to think had no chance of winning. 




 Could you elaborate on this? 










































































 It's referring to Iowa:

it was the largest for any single candidate in the 2016 presidential election cycle **here** so far.
