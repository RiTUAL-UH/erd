 As well, once you get a bit of gunpowder, you can duplicate it via Alchemic Chemistry with blood, or hand in the repeatable quest "Covered in Ash" 




 Yup. ME^3 's gonna win. GG, m8. 




 Running Red is about being dead. 




 And really, m8? Parcel gets a flair, and I don't?

I see how it is .

 Why is your name VikeStep? 




 It's all good! \o/ 




 m8, not trying to be rude or anything. Your explanation was very good, I was just pointing out some stuff you missed. No need to yell at me 




 I also think the story deserves some focus, as much of it revolves around it. The player is dead, and has to cope with being dead. It takes place between life and whatever happens after. Very light and cheery, right? 














 :O
There's a mods section on the MC wiki? :OOOOOOOOO 




 /r/PCMasterRace 




 \o/ Amazing!
Suggestion: I don't know if you've done this, but you are able to disable Mystcraft Instability per-age. There's an in-game command to do it. 




 First, put a Fluid Transition Plane next to the lava to soak up the liquids, like Cypher said.
Then, if you want, you can have the AE network output a certain signal when it's grabbed enough Lava. Have it output to the Master Ritual Stone, and bam! It will only consume a certain amount of lava before turning the ritual off. 









 You're amazing at everything, it appears :P 




 Yes, I'll get that out in a few updates. It has the compass texture because I can't texture :P
I've gotten permission to use other textures in an upcoming update, so don't worry! :D 




 Yeah I waited until I had a Igneus Extruder going to make Compressed Cobblestone for my farm 




 I'm doing Blood Magic/Botania, probs Mekanism/Thermal Expansion. Also the big "everything centered around Blood Magic" one, AKA Running Red. 









 Personally, I prefer to play Demoman.

This video shows off the new gamemode I created. All it is is a simple config file that the server downloads, and executes, allowing for anyone connected to play in a Zombie Apocalypse, without any download required by the client.

From "About.txt":
"The game is a four player co-op match where you attempt to complete the original objective of the map. In Upward, you push the cart, in Process, you capture the 3 control points, in King, you try to capture the control point and survive for 3 minutes. Unfortunately, in Apocalypse Rising, the players are hindered by zombies. These zombies spawn in groups of 6, every 20 seconds. Not only that, but each player only has one life per match, adding to the overall difficulty. [There are 3 maps that have support included in this, Upward, Kong King, and Process, all of which represent a different difficulty. Included in the readme file are instructions for adding compatibility to new maps.]

Apocalypse Rising was created in order to give clients a fun, easy way to play TF2 as a zombie game. The policy I had when making this was that I wanted there to be absolutely no download on the client's end, and that policy has held up until the end.

I'll take a moment here to say that Apocalypse Rising is completely open source, just read the configs to see what's happening, and feel free to change or add stuff to it.. Maybe I'll even make a video on that."

Thank you for looking at this. -Gideon Seymour 
























 Immediately after the announcement, I tried to feel sad that I didn't win. And I tried. But I couldn't feel sad. There was no reason to (aside from the lack of communication between the hosts and participants). I would have made Running Red anyway, I'd had the idea for a while, but this competition just gave me a reason not to procrastinate. It wasn't about winning. It was about making a good pack. And I feel I have done that. I've made a pack that sends a message, and is unique, which is something that rarely happens these days. I've accomplished my goal, and gone far above it. Running Red got listed, which is something I've only dreamed of. @PurpleMentat , who has always been one of my favorite Youtubers, did a series on my pack. Plus, I tied what is currently the most popular modpack. I consider that to be a huge achievement. I'm happy to have been part of this competition. It wasn't about winning. It was about sending a message. And you know what, I accomplished my goal.

Thank you for all that you've done, and congratulations to Parcel. 




 It (once I finish the story) will have a great impact if you choose to kill the cows and chickens. 




 I'll look into that 




 Forge version 1217 




 The biggest similarity is that is uses HQM.
Public Pack Code. 




 Sometime in the next 72 hours, and playing the first will not affect the second. Completely different experiences. 




 Yes.

Amazing. 




 I had this dream that the results were leaked to Panda and then we grilled him for information. He didn't say anything, and then the results were released.

You won, because you had a Mini-Me of Slowpoke101. Slowpoke said in the dream post that there was no other reason.

It was the worst nightmare ever. 




 You wish. 




 It's LOL. Apparantly it originated on 4chan. I blame ThatOneSlowking for it. 




 top kek 




 top kek. 




 I like parties. 




 You need slabs on all the sides, and then you can water them with a Watering Can to speed up the growth drastically. 




 I make Running Red. I just want to be First ^ ^ 
























 Not too late to add it.... ;) 




 Running Red spatial cell coming right up 









 You could try Running Red 2: Vampire money [here](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-7-10-beta-running-red-2-vampire-money-chapter-one-hardcore-magic-rpg.51957/). It's a hardcore pack based around combat. And other fun stuff. 




 :3 




 It appears so. I'm working on a fix 




 Running Red?

#shamelessplug 




 And yeah. If you didn't see what trajing said, the release is now available on the launcher 









 What version of BM are you using? 




 Here, I'll give a few more, as people haven't found these:

* Energy Cube from Mekanism (Mechanized)
* Die 64 times (We're Not Working Out)
* Something involving Milk. I can't remember what, exactly (Running White) 




 What is the average airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?

All there. 




 Despite the fact that you told me this was your account several times on IRC. 




 Bloody hell, RealSketch.

You have some sources for that conclusion? 




 I use Unity by CyanideX, as even things that aren't textured yet blend in well with the theme 




 There's one being developed here:
http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-7-10-hqm-hardcore-the-butterflutter-0-0-1.51296/ 




 The pull request is being merged, which does several things, but the most important being the move from the BC API to the RF API 









 And adding in the Lifesteal effect. Normal Golden apples will not be craftable, and Ghasts won't drop tears*. The only non-violent way to get health regen is via Notch Apples.

*Air Sigils 'n all the things that use the tears as components will have altered recipes. 




 If you can get it 




 It's a custom potion effect designed by Strikingwolf that gives health regeneration when you damage things, AKA drinking their blood. You get the effect thanks to Lore Expansion, which awards you the effect when you get the appropriate piece of lore, AKA your level of vampirism 









 Pretty much. 
























 Aha. I see what you did there. 




 And in EnderIO you can upgrade your machines with new Capacitors as you go. You can also upgrade your armour and conduits. 




 Not sure what he's looking for in a point. Unless you've got a quest book, Minecraft is a game where you do whatever you want. It's sandbox for a reason. If he truly wanted a point, he could use HQM or play another game.

And it's not like TiC has more of a point than EIO.

What could have happened:
 someone (~chatzilla@2001:558:6025:b:61a6:66e3:ae28:196a) has joined #TinkersConstruct

"I've made a Pickaxe. What am I supposed to make next?"

"Tell me there's something to make next. I will be severely disappointed if there isn't."

"I'm looking for progression or something to do other than 'hurr move dirt and stone around'"

"I'm looking for a goal or task that the mod wants me to perform."

"The mod has content with absolutely no direction or purpose on its own?"

It's a sandbox game. It's not meant to have a goal. 




 I always ask this :P

 For the armour, it only blocks 90% of damage now, if you have the required blood. However, using Soul Harden, you can get it back to 100%.
But it was buffed at the same time. Now it has more protection against Piercing and other negative effects like Wither.

 This is my base on a slightly modified PhoenixCraft II. I think it's pretty good, but I need some help figuring out what to do. I give descriptions and stuff on the album's page. I'm usually not one for aesthetic builds, so this is a little new to me. 









 Not sure how up to date this is, but there's this: http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/cofh-world-generation-users-manual.48678/ 




 Sweet! 




 Everyone's favorite Blood Magic Dev [WayofTime](https://www.youtube.com/user/WayofFlowingTime) has been playing Bevo's Tech Pack for 1.7.10. 




 It's filling the internal buffer. If anyone were to use "I'm Looking at Blood" (an addon for WAILA), or take out the Vanilla Sigil of Sight, they'd see that it is filling the internal buffer. 

The Internal Buffer itself holds 10% of the Altar's max capacity, so for a non-upgraded Blood Altar, it would drain about 1000 blood. Subsequent upgrades (E.X. Runes of Augmented Capacity) will increase that, and Runes of Dislocation will increase the speed at which it fills/empties. 




 This guy explained it well:

 I know how to use Lockdown, m8. But until the feature is added that allows for one to specify the spawn dimension, you can use PerfectSpawn to specify it.

As of right now, Lockdown and PerfectSpawn do different things, as Lockdown generates the same world, and PerfectSpawn specifies an exact spot for people to spawn at. 




 You can use PerfectSpawn for that 




 ...Blood Magic 




 Adding to this.

For even more guidance on mods that aren't in Monster, [Material Energy^3](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-6-4-material-energy-3-jampacked-hqm-ctm-beta.48913/) appears to be popular, as well as [Running Red](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-6-4-running-red-v1-1-4-jam-packed-hardcore-magic-rpg-good-as-crash-landing.47464/) (#Shamelessplug).

Running Red is focused around telling a story (and a fun mod called [Blood Magic](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1290532-1-7-10-2-1-6-4-blood-magic-v1-2-0-updated-oct-13)), and may have a theme a little too dark for some people. It tied with Crash Landing in second for the Jam-Packed competition, which makes it just as popular. Right? .

ME^3 is focused around conquering dungeons in an amazing CTM style experience, having you collect trophies, complete quests, and complete the Periodic Table. It's a very fun and popular experience. It won first place in Jam-Packed, and I really recommend checking it out. 




 I was about to ask why there wasn't a "No" answer. Then I realised. 




 inb4 you crash into another planet 




 Deadly World 




 Well, this is vanilla. But if you happen to head underground, and see a cobble version... Silverfish nest! \o/ 




 I'm testing a new release right now. It's *mostly* bugfixes, as it's been hard to add new content while working on three packs. Recently I've been requested to update PhoenixCraft II, and as well, I need to get that one update out for Running Red.

Once I finish all those, I'll start on adding new content. I have some things in mind.... ;) 




 I imagine like with Crash Landing, where they'll have points taken off 
























 Sweet! 









 Woo! 




 I'm so happy to have a Mindcracker playing my pack! :D

 My last item I needed was Meat Boy. It seems dumb, but every single time I was getting Bandage Girl instead. When I finally got all of Meat Boy (basically RNG, even if you had Book of Revelations, because the Meat Boy/Bandage Girl thing.). It unlocked the three (Platinum God, Real Platinum God, and Meat Boy) at once. So there ya go.

 I stopped learning when I was able to play in class with the Vita 




 * Devil/Angel Rooms never spawn on the First Floor, however,
* The Goat Head ("He Accepts Your Offering") will force a Devil/Angel Room to spawn, no matter the floor
* Not taking damage on the floor increases the chance of a Devil/Angel Room spawning
* The Evil/Sin stat increases the chance of Devil Rooms
* The Faith stat increases the chance of Angel Rooms
* Making a deal with the Devil greatly lowers the chance of an Angel Room spawning, and will increase the chance of Devil Rooms 




 All you can do is praise to RNGesus it doesn't happen again 




 You can reach the Cathedral or Sheol after the Mom's Heart fight by getting a Devil or Angel room on that floor. Otherwise, you'll be forced into the chest.

However, after you've beaten Mom 10 times, whenever you go back down there again, you'll face off against It Lives!!! rather than Mom's Heart. After killing It Lives!!!, you'll be given the option to go to either the Cathedral or Sheol, every time you get that far. 




 I miss the textures. 




  **"Chub dislikes smoke!"**

This is a reference to how, when a bomb is placed while Chub is charging, he'll consume it and it'll explode within him. This is also a reference to Legend of Zelda, as a similar boss disliked smoke and was killed in the same manner (credit to /u/Aksh0le )

 **"Rooms may yield more than you expect - Experimentation is key"**
 **"A dark market lies under your feet"**

These refer to what's beneath the carpets Zelda-esque sleeping rooms and some rocks, as these trapdoors can sometimes lead to the Black Market rooms.

 **"The walls will harden over time - Time is the essence"**

This refers to how the Boss Rush Room only appears in the wall if you beat Mom in less than 20 minutes, else the wall will "harden" and you won't be able to access it.

 **"A piece of paper is your guide"**

This hints at the Missing Poster and the Mysterious Paper, which, when you die in a Sacrifice Room, will give you a piece of the puzzle to unlocking The Lost.

 **"Deny his gifts to attain your reward"**

This refers to how you have to forgo the offerings of the Devil Room in order for Angel Rooms to appear later.

 **"Sleeping gatekeepers will need to be awoken with a loud sound"**

This refers to how one must blow up the Angels in the Angel Rooms in order to fight them to attain the Key Pieces. I feel as though the Devils don't blow up like the Angels because Satan doesn't want you to fight him, as there's still a small chance he'll lose. Every offering he gives, although some make you stronger, also potentially make you weaker for the final battle against him.

 **"Some doors require a blessing - Carry them with you"**

This refers to how the Key Pieces, the blessings from the Angel Room, are needed to open the doors to the Mega-Satan boss. 














 I think it would be amazing to have someone write reviews on modpacks, mods, and does interviews, and whatnot. That's all we would need to make ModMyMC a full news outlet.

Several people (including yours truly .) have expressed interest in doing something like that. It wouldn't be restricted to just Feed the Beast, but could include AT Launcher, and Technic, and those doing interviews could speak with people prominent in the modding community. I personally would love to see something like this, but I don't  know if anyone else is. 
























 Yeah, we just brought on a whole bunch more people. We should get through the updates much more quickly. 









 You could try [Phoenix Reborn](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-7-10-phoenix-reborn-tech-magic-progression-ores.59301/). It's got quite a bit of tweaking, and has all the mods you mentioned. Plus, it's got a whole bunch of progression instituted and whatnot. 




 Well, due to how progression works in Phoenix Reborn, ProjectE isn't accessible 'till late game, and can't be automated until even later. So, at the beginning of the game, I had a huge farm in order to supply me with plenty of toast. I had several machines that I used in various stages, and most of them are still back at the original base where power gen is. I only transferred the frequently used ones to the new dimension.

And I figured that I might as well make it compact, once I started making the void dimension. From there it was pretty simple. 




 http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2229562-rftools-dimension-builder-teleportation-powerful 




 Yes, it's amazing. I've looked at the Shield System as well, and it's a great low processing power cost alternative to MFFS. Plus, it's really easy to build the shield as well. 




 That's either Apple Core or Spice of Life. It indicates the amount of time left in that Hunger Point. I believe you can disable it in the configs. 









 Don't worry, you're not a bad person. It's my fault for making the code a little to obvious :P 




 Heh, I'll make sure to fix that.

 Running Red, Wanderlust, and Tolkiencraft II. 




 If you look through this AMA, you'll see that even slowpoke himself agreed that Ultimate, although generally looked upon as well balanced, actually had quite a few balance issues, mainly via cross-mod compatibility.

I find the tools much more of a upside than a downside - without them, something like Running Red or Crash Landing would never have been possible. And bloat, well, I think FTB is trying to avoid that now. You saw how Monster turned out. FTB is now trying to make well balanced and enjoyable packs, between Mage Quest, the soon to be released inFlux, and Resurrection, we have very many specific packs. Sure, there is a lot of them. But it's not like Monster or the Adventure Update - everything isn't being crammed into one. Each pack caters to specific audiences. No single pack is too large, and no single pack is too big to be considered to have content bloat. 

The tools are helping pack creators fulfill there vision for the packs. Without them, I would never have been able to tell a story, Jaded wouldn't have been able to build the paradise in the sky, Eyamaz wouldn't have been able to create hell on Earth, Iskandar wouldn't have been able to create a faraway planet, Orator would never have been able to bring to life the works of JRR Tolkien, parcel would never have been able to make compressed cookies, Elec would never have been able to create the skylands, Lumaceon would never have been able to make a Crafting Paradise, and Yulife would never have been able to reload our Wanderlust. These tools are what give are packs life. They're what make our packs unique and not just another kitchen sink pack, which is all we had before this. We're not creating bloat - we're creating something new. Something unique.

I'm sure we'd all be glad to play the same packs, over and over again, just for a different version of mods, or a different version of Minecraft. But I find it more enjoyable to play something new. To be cast into a world without water, or one filled with evil creatures, or in a station, with disks of the world in my hand, or in a medieval landscape, or in a home in the sky. None of this would have been possible without these tools. None of the small tweakings that go into making each pack work. We can make our packs better, and take our time to give you good content, or, would you prefer it if we gave you a kitchen sink pack with cross-mod compatibility issues? Sure, one may take time. But each time we take our time, we create something new. Whether it's a mainstream pack built around Gregtech and memories of the past, or a jarring landing on a distant planet, we're reinventing modpacks.

Noone's trying to replace Ultimate. Ultimate has been done. We're trying to create something new. If you want Ultimate, it's still there for you to play it. We making things that haven't been made before. Just look at the Third Party Modpacks section on the FTB Forums. Would you prefer that each pack is another kitchen-sink pack with different mods, or would you prefer to see stuff in there like Crash Landing, ME^3, Wanderlust, Tolkiencraft, Running Red, PhoenixCraft, Blast Off!, Infinitech, FluxGalaxy, ImpactFlux, Clouds of Darkness, and the Dark Trilogy? These tools have given us the power to create packs like this. No one pack has content bloat- they all have their own visions and tweaks and quests that make up what each pack is. We don't throw mods together and change IDs anymore, like we did with Ultimate. We take those mods and change them, make them fit in the world in which we are creating. We can do so much more than we used to, thanks to these tools. Would you call that a caveat, or a bonus? I'd call it a bonus. 




 The reason it takes more time than it used to is because there are so many more tools available to pack creators. It's not so much throwing mods together and fixing ID Conflicts anymore - now we have the ability to change recipes, create quests, change ore gen, biomes, and so much more. So yeah, it takes more time than it used to, but as well, there's so much more being put into it. 




 Not certain why, but it's in the changelog for the latest build: http://minecraft.curseforge.com/mc-mods/59968-special-mobs/files/2216952 




 All you need to do to fix this is update Special Mobs. 




 Well, try the second. It's nothing like the first. 









 For the world generators, EBXL was only included because of the ability to enable and disable the biomes and villages in those biomes. I'm trying to avoid adding any mods that add content like that, just things that can be used as bases for packs. 




 Alright, I added those. 




 Probably the original for ultimate. The panes are arranged in the same format

 Because it takes a while to make these things. 














 What is the average airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow? 




 It's technically not made for multiplayer, but in the recent updates, I've been trying to add more support for it.

I've made quests repeatable so those on non-hardcore worlds and servers can reclaim their effects after death, and I've also added a multiplayer only object that allows for others to revive you. Possibly more in the future.

Anyway, I would be interested to see if there are any servers as well.
