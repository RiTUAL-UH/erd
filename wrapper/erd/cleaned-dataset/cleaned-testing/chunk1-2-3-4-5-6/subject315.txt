 I was raised with very limited cooking and food health knowledge and I think this might be a good forum for myself and others. Examples of food facts can be anything food related that you think people might not know, such as: spinach has more protein per pound than steak, or to keep your egg yolk from overcooking when making over-easy eggs poke a small hole in the egg yolk once you have the egg off the pan and on your plate.

 At the end of ME3 you have a chance to meld with Liara's mind in this sexy galaxy scene where she hugs your arm. I am now replaying a new career, and when speaking with Liara I find out that their species mates with any other species of any sex by exploring their mate's minds and their genetic material. Could Shepard's genetic material live on in Liara? Does anyone remember if Liara survives in the end?  









 Mine is the M-11 Wraith shotgun. Small clip size, but very powerful, accurate, lightweight, and very quick to reload.  









 Were you even playing the game? I've almost finished, making mostly a renegade campaign, and I am deeply affected by the choices I've made. I lied to the Wrex about the Genophage, wiped out the entire Quarian fleet and watched the wreckage burn like fireworks in the sky of their homeworld, mercy-killed an Ardat-Yakshi, watched Tali kill herself....all because of choices I have made (or didn't make). I would say in comparison to ME1 and 2, the choices are much deeper in ME3, more emotionally connected. I really like playing the renegade campaign, and found it pretty easy to play along in ME1 and 2, but in 3, I really can feel the emotional impact of my choices. I can't be the only one who finds this a masterpiece of space opera. 

[EDIT] I'm going to get drunk and finish the game tonight so I'll post later and tell you guys my final assessment..but so far its been pretty fun. So far I've gotten my moneys worth.

 Three things concerning Halo and it's sequels (anyone else feel this way?) 

1. When I'm over at a friends house and the only multiplayer game they own is Halo, I instantly lose some respect for that friend.

2. When I am forced in a situation where I must play one or two minutes of Halo, it feels as if I am defying one of my base morals, and I lose a little respect for myself.

3. WTF? Another Halo? Doesn't anyone realize how much Halo sucks, and how awful it is compared to this generation's FPS (single and multiplayer) greats? 

In conclusion, HALO SUCKS BALLSAKS.

 Personally I feel like some of the things posted to /r/gaming that are labeled "No Spoiler" are in fact spoilers. They are not spoilers because they give away story, they are spoilers because they give away crucial gameplay elements that would have been fun to discover on my own. Now, if it was a movie, any talk about the movie before you have seen it is a spoiler because a movie is a linear thing, it goes from point A to point B and if you give up something in between that line it's a spoiler. A video game on the other hand, or any video game worth its salt, is a non-linear dynamic media that somebody interacts with. I get pleasure out of discovering things about a game, about the little nuances and side-routes. I make it a point to never read a walkthrough guide until after I have beaten the game by my own wits. For example, I saw a "Last of Us" post about how it is a survival horror game with no scare jumps. Well great, that takes away some of the suspense I might be feeling when I finally play it. Or, on a post I have made a while back I labeled as a "Minor Spoiler" because I told people the best way to kill a Cazador in New Vegas. But people complained, said that it wasn't a spoiler. But to me, it definitely was because when I found out how to do that on my own a whole new world of gameplay elements opened up to me in New Vegas. So...I leave it to you...should we modify the spoiler policy or am I just bitching to the wind?

TL;DR I think that certain things labeled "No Spoiler" are in fact spoilers because they give away gameplay elements.

 Someone here obviously cannot read between parentheses.  




 I say keep on hating. Hate is an acceptable, natural response to something that is terrible for humanity. And the fact that we let fat people live on without shame to keep on making more fat, bratty kids is absolutely terrible for humanity. 




 Juat rain. I swear we are raising a nation of wimps.

 Yes, perhaps this is a vain attempt. Maybe we could appeal to them to use  this as a forum for their own "confession." I would expect the use of throwaway accounts. One can only hope.

 You would hate the original  




 My girlfriend has this same problem and wonders why she can't make friends. I've never been able to establish a concrete reason why people don't like her, she is a very nice and attractive person. I also have the same problem with making friends. So...our solution is just fucking our brains out and giving the middle finger to the world. Fuck it all and have sex. Forced friends will invariably let you down in some way, and in a way you almost set yourself up for failure, I think, by scrutinizing things too closely. Another suggestion from me would be to put yourself in a place you would not normally be, get out of your comfort zone. Good luck!   




 Yay another app that reads my texts. And thats actually part of the appeal? Fuck this app. 




 It's as shame her feet are wrecked by high -heels.

 i was pointing out the hypocrisy here 




 Can we all agree that the term "real man" means jack shit? 




 true 




 we fucked when we were horny teens, then forced into marriage when the pregnancy happened. By forced I mean what the hell else do we know when we are 19? 




 read up 




 horny teenagers dont know what crazy is, because they are crazy 




 Nah, my ex just love to pose "hypotheticals" to me to start arguments.  




 fuck 




 So I mentioned the HPV vaccine to her, strangely, she is on board with that but tries to fight me on the flu shot (i work in a hospital,  my kids definitely get the shot). I think she gets most of her info from "blog mom" websites 




 This is partially true. My ex is so fundie now she won't have sex with another person until she is married again. She brags about this to me, when I mention that she seems lonely because she just loves to waste time texting and calling me, she tells me that all men are losers not worthy of her blah blah blah, in the meantime my kids get to witness what a wonderful example she is. 




 Yeah to too late for that.  But honestly I had no idea she was capable of these levels of fundie when we were married 




 Lol. It's a subreddit... not an admission of anything! If you judge people on their post history on reddit, I can't imagine how you deal with people IRL. Sorry you feel this way!

 It's an imperfect system. It's the media that does the initial damage... do we really need to see their mug shots until they are sentenced?  




 They are not murderers until convicted. I know you really want everything summed up in a song and dance and then change the channel, but we can't do that in an ordered society.  




 We also don't need people jumping to conclusions before all the facts are heard.  




 She is not subjectively fat. Her BMI I'm sure is in the "obese" range. You are too emotional.  




 I mean fat...do you mean fat? 




 You can tell she was already ruining her feet even at this young age with high heels and small shoes. That big toe angle... dead giveaway and kind of a turn off. 




 Holy heck she got...uh....you know. 




 She is good-looking now,  but I can't help but get this sinking feeling she is not going to age well.

 So is it a hard "no" then? Is everything so black-and-white? If they are how I propose, wouldn't it be in their best interest to keep up appearances? 




 The fact that your thoughts come from 10-second searches which are invariably biased has eliminated my desire to have further discussion with you.  




 Does it not deserve some thought? 




 If they are a cult then perhaps we are not fully aware of their inner workings. Does anybody get what I'm saying here? Maybe they have taken it upon themselves to be hated so everyone else can love each other. Just another thought.  




 Personally I feel they are a pro-lgbt and pro-human rights group in "disguise." They announce ahead of time where they are going to protest. Almost every time they are mentioned in the news it is also mentioned that the community came together to form a human wall or something to stop them. And they just stand out there smiling holding their signs, then pack up and leave without hurting anybody. I feel their message is in fact not "God Hates Fags" or anything along that line. I think their message is more about the community coming together in harmony and they have found a way to do it consistently. Just a thought.

 More flaunting. My point is made.  




 If you breed dogs you are a bad person for that choice. If you support dog breeders you are a bad person for that choice. Just because people are happy about what they do doesn't make them good people. My words aren't going to make the bad people go away, but I can point out your flaunting your evil in the faces of reddit users. And you really can only claim ignorance on my behalf when all the humane societies close down due to lack of homeless animals.  




 You can't type your way out of this or point your finger at anyone but yourself when you open your home to a bred dog. What you have done is a moral travesty and you support a community of evil.  




 We could spend all day Googling shit to support our sides...but the big difference lies in the fact that I don't have an immoral action to defend. This is telling in itself. You are not made a good person because some people may support you.   




 Your bred dog is the living representation of a homeless dog put to sleep for a choice you made.  




 Let me rephrase: Breeding dogs is a moral travesty. Every dog bred means another dog dead.   




 Then you are a piece of shit human being. 




 Breeding dogs for profit is a moral travesty,  period.  




 Go to hell, dog breeder. There are dogs at the humane society that need homes.

 So what is your end-game? In your mind can a school that does not need improvement even exist? What will make you satisfied, or is it that you're telling us we should never be satisfied with the free educational services our children receive.

 My girlfriend and I attempted to watch "Olympus has Fallen" and ended up turning it off after 30 mins or so. It was just a bunch of mean people shooting screaming people (from what I remember) and it wasn't fun for us.  




 Oy, that's a heifer that is.  




 She's got a tight little body. Totally a cougar. 









 Whothafuck? 




 My Grandpa took me to see "Con Air" with Nicolas Cage. It was also my first introduction to Steve Buscemi and John Malkovich. 




 Everything mammalian is surprisingly relative in some way. For instance the average breath volume for land mammals is about 6-8 mL per kg of ideal body mass. 

EDIT:ideal
 




 But it seemed rather automatic, programmed to only move when I was shooting, like the gun's trigger was the gas pedal. It was fucking trippy.  




 So I was playing an online session and I had a pretty hefty wanted level. All of a sudden a zentorno (I think) with no driver appears out of nowhere and I am able to get in the passenger seat. It only starts moving if I actively trying to defend myself from the police using a gun from the passenger seat. And it always moves in the direction  away from the police officers and eventually I'm able to remove my wanted level...I think. I died before I was able to find out and I've never seen the ghost-getaway car again. Is this a thing?  Was I tripping? 




 Shitty potato cam lights 




 IMO Jansport's are just as flimsy you cheap, talented bastard.  




 Who? 




 Black? 




 No actually those are painted bats. Stop raping the language.  




 Shocked that an old person died or shocked that nobody has heard of this really old person? To me you should not be shocked by either considering this is a computer machine. 




 Isn't that like the risk you take if you are a military vehicle? 




 The sad part is I went into this movie totally prepared to be weirded out and this part was just too weird for me.  




 I sort of lost it when he was having virtual sex with her. It was stupid and downhill after that.  









 I'm so sick of seeing Emma Stone's pug-ugly face in movies. I'll skip this one just not to hear her talk. 




 Talk about getting fired up. 




 I'm getting a little sick of Chris Pratt. I feel like his career is the product of focus groups. 




 Those are some disgusting feet. Jesus what is wrong with you people? 




 Show us your tits already. 




 Suspend yourself in the disbelief. I think you are doing it right because you really are not supposed to like Piper all that much. Have you watched the second season?  




 Considering Japan can't have a military... 




 Just shut the fuck up already. The guy makes movies with similar artistic styles... woop de doo! 




 She's cutting the circulation off to her toes with those fucking stupid shoes.  




 Show us your tits already 




 Yeah, Texas doesn't count.  




 This bullshit simply doesnt happen in gun-friendly states. Thankfully I live in Michigan. 




 I am starting to get my 9 year old daughter into comics and she is showing an interest in drawing them as well. What would you suggest I do to stoke her creative fire?  




 The first time I ever heard about you was when I listened to LoveLines with you and Dr. Drew way back in the day. 




 LPT: buy some fucking sunglasses and use your goddamn windshield visors.  




 Jesus its a fucking trailer....would you like the whole movie? I swear people just love to spoil things for themselves.  




 I heard somewhere (im too lazy to link right now....someone do it for me please) that it was because the harsh winter killed off their usual prey of wild animals. 




 If you are a mammal, might I suggest doing daily tick checks. They are everywhere. 




 The Grand Budapest Hotel

I was amazed, I was glued to my seat, and I was very impressed with the acting. I cried when it was over knowing that something this beautiful graces the big screen only a few times during my generation.  




 Your kid is a pussy. Tell him to nut up and grow a pair. 




 Stop everything! A rich and famous person is hurt!  




 First and foremost: improve your English.  




 Eh, they's knobby. 




 Those are some weird lookin toes 




 Some of that frustration results from the fact that we feel we should be able to tell the person how to spend the money once we hand it over, like the money is still yours even though you've given it away, which is not the case. Money, once given, belongs to the recipient. You should feel happier that you made someone's day easier. And if they spend it on drugs or beer, that is their right as a human being.  




 I love how this thread turned from hating on selfish bitches to proclaiming what an awesome society we are in general by not helping those in need with a buck or two, or a handful of spare change from our pockets. Poverty is a real problem that real people suffer from. You all should be ashamed of yourselves.  




 You would need a predator to find that out.... 














 No Emily, what are you doing? You have best feet in hollywood, take off those feet ruining high heels! 




 You think that matters? Ha. 




 FUCK YEAH  




 FUCK YEAH A LIFETIME OF DEBT AND DESPAIR 




 But if we all did this then we wouldn't get to leave snappy notes for our roomates! 




 Make up your mind already so they know if you're going to hell or not. 




 Maybe don't try be like them and wear symbolic jewelry. You just validate them by trying to be like them. 




 Self-promoting bullshit. Fancy fondant-covered slabs of sugar bread are a phase of this generation,  and when the fad dies your business will most likely follow.  




 The other dude doesnt get upset...there is no cringe here, maybe just a slight misunderstanding between buddies.  




 That bird has a parasite that makes it seem so "friendly." Seriously, kill it.  




 I think that grin is a result of bad teeth or lack thereof. I agree that the dumbass cabbie is totally at fault for believing a dude with jacked-up teeth.  




 Fuck this sterotyping meme.  




 Bullshit sentence, he should be senrenced longer to max security. This sixteen-year-old PERSON held someone at gunpoint. He deserves to have the book thrown at him. Once you decide to hold someone at gunpoint, you aren't a kid anymore, you are an adult who should face all the consequences of one.  




 Ewww 




 Gross feet-ruining high heels 




 Big deal. I mean...its a really big deal.  




 More religion, more problems 









 Goddamn I feel sorry for the bloke that has to windex those 




 Do it yourself. Google Earth or something.  




 Yep, she has reached the limit. That baby face looks too creepy on her body now. 




 Wut 




 Probably some weird Asian thingy or whatnot.  




 Thanks science, for letting all the poachers in the world know where to go for a sea turtle free-for-all in international waters.  




 It's a travesty nonetheless. Comparing the two and saying one "ain't so bad" is evidence of injustice and of a society run by propoganda machines. You are getting sucked into it, pal, and are becoming part of the problem. Both ways are wrong. It is wrong to even have forum for knee-jerking verdicts until this case is decided in court but America fucked that up a long, long time ago and now we breed people who have no idea what justice really is outside of what Hollywood rams down their throats.  




 You can't compare the two ways of social injustice as being similar or different. You aren't right by being less wrong.  




 I feel like she would be more popular if her last name wasn't panty-hair. 
























 the mom on the right clearly wears the pants in that relationship 




 Sleep and spend time with your family. Things will get better as you get older.  




 cat smells meat is all

 wait... isn't this a comic book? 




 fattie alert! 




 Pussies don't like dicks, because pussies get fucked by dicks. But dicks also fuck assholes: assholes who just want to shit on everything. Pussies may think they can deal with assholes their way. But the only thing that can fuck an asshole is a dick, with some balls. The problem with dicks is: they fuck too much or fuck when it isn't appropriate  and it takes a pussy to show them that. But sometimes, pussies can be so full of shit that they become assholes themselves... because pussies are an inch and half away from assholes.  




 this movie blows 




 Your low karma from this post speaks volumes. This comic and this thread is masturbatory bullshit...and I'm not excluding myself.  




 It's a fucking comic book cliche. Get over yourself.  




 She should make a porn before she goes.  




 "Against the Day" by Pynchon. A book that deals with every possible human condition in every possible way.  




 Another suicide attempt stopped by a superhero bit. A real superhero would have let this guy remove himself from the gene pool.  




 Oh you mean Singapore, where they cane you half to death if you chew gum in public? Ok then. 




 I want to sex her 




 where... where are the fat chicks?  









 i want this to be a porn

 He is no hero or role model... he hung himself life a coward.

 You're a spoiled little shit.  




 I'm not talking about the dirt I'm talking about the dehydration killing them off. 




 Good, that will get rid of all those dirty blacks 




 She's fat enough 




 Hey hey hey... let the kid die on his own. No need to drown him in the ocean.  




 This film is failing because it was made by Kevin Smith and the 90"s ended 15 years ago.  




 wow...you are a loser 




 Just stop it, stop being a bitch. Give your husband more blowjobs

 yeah buy their gay blood would turn people gay so I totally get why they are banned from donating. Also AIDS

 First if all, sever that long distance relationship. More than likely she is fucking somebody else up there. Secondly, get a job you bum.

 shit I'd by a sweet new car instead 




 you have it backwards 




 probably smells like musk and cocoa butter 




 they look like bowling pins drawn by a mental patient  




 That is the exact flavor I just had tonight. Only 10 pb cups in the whole fucking thing. Lets be conservative and say it takes 40 ice cream spoonfuls to finish a standard sized B J tub. If I'm only getting one pb cup every fourth spoonful, I'm raging just as hard. It's not a satisfying pb cup to spoonful ratio.  









 goddammit its "pedal" not "petal" you dumbfuck 




 Now I know where to go to laugh at your tats in person. After I eat, of course. I don't want spit garnish.  




 The Galaxy Diner?  




 My self esteem is boosted knowing that I don't have tats like that. I hope you play the guitar really well or own your own hot topic franchise because those are minimum-wage tats fo sho. 

EDIT: it looks like someone drew on your asterisks with a sharpie

2nd EDIT: and periods

 Not impressed. Looks like a pet store. They probably have a policy saying pets are allowed.  




 I want to make the sex with you 




 I blame the fact that "Kick-Ass 2" was such shit. Such a rotten, stinking turd ferguson of a movie.  




 The stabbing scene in "Chopper" 




 I want to sex your wife. 




 when you have sex.... there are two penises in you 









 Kick-ass 2 was a rank piece of shit.  




 no, that's just Paul Rudd as Paul Rudd. 









 bout time someone made a movie from a Pynchon novel, though I must mention, of all his works, this was probably the easiest to adapt a screenplay from.  




 "The Crying of Lot 49" by Thomas Pynchon 




 Write "Don't do it." on Alan Turing's last apple. 




 His acting is such shit nowadays. He just squishes his face together and turns from the camera....so much.  




 The article is wrong. So far there have been four seasons based on the first THREE novels. 




 Now its a nigger-beacon 




 I can't get past the bulldog face. 




 [Ok, thanks for explaining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIsc8ooXug list=PLD8B4E0E6A19D7A36) 




 These movies are such shit and if you are entertained by them you are fucking retarded.  




 Why should we care if she is black?
