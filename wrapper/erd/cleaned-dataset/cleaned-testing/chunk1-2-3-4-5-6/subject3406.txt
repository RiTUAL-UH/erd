 I am noting the plural, and I wish you noted the singular and capitalization of what I had written.

I said that a cynic might take the position that the Court, singular, capitalized, and in context, clearly the Supreme Court, seems to use standing to hear cases it wants to and not hear cases that it doesn't.

I went on to elaborate about how standing jurisprudence is incongruous. (And it is.)

Which relates to my original point-a cynic might well find that the Court (singular, capitalized) has made these incongruous decisions on standing based on politics. 




 Not sure what the bolding is for.

Lujan creates a new standard for standing. Lujan requires an injury in fact to a legally protectable interest, that has to be concrete, particularized, has to be within a concrete particularized injury within the statute, imminent, actual, and not conjectural. Redressability is another big hurdle for standing that Lujan delves into-in order to have standing, it must be likely that a favorable court decision can redress the harm at issue.

One major element of Simon is that it was a case about redressability. Yes, the complaint described instances in which the individual respondents were refused treatment. This part could not be said to be speculative. But still no standing because the S.Ct. found that a favorable decision would not necessarily mean that the harm would be redressed.

This brings us back to Duke. Many of the harms listed in Duke were not imminent or actual, were not concrete, and were conjectural. The Court in Duke did not run through the full eleven criteria the Court created in Lujan. Why the different standards of standing? Politics. The types of injuries in fact alleged in Duke were not different in their redressability from those of Simon. Ruling in the plaintiffs' favor would not have necessarily meant the harm would be averted or redressed. The Court decided this did not matter and they could still get to the merits. Why the different standards of standing? Politics.

The case law on standing is contradictory and incongruous. Period. 




 Sure. Compare Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, Simon v. Eatern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, and Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc.

All three are standing cases.

In Lujan, the Court finds that there is no relationship between the harm sustained, traceable to the government, and that the harm is too speculative.

In Simon, the harm was, again, too speculative to be considered the concrete injury required by Article III.

In Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., the claims at stake were no more speculative than in Lujan and Simon. Nevertheless, a majority wanted to decide on the merits so they could bring certainty and stability to the nuclear power industry. Sure, the claims at issue were, if judging by previous decisions, speculative, but by finding there was standing, the Court could (and did) then go on to uphold the constitutionality of the Price-Anderson Act that puts a cap on damages from catastrophic nuclear accidents. This cap is required, for practical purposes, for nuclear plants to get insurance and so by taking the case and ruling the way they did, the Court was able to help the nuclear industry. Pure politics.

(And to illustrate the speculative nature of the claims in that case, note that one of the rationals for upholding the damage cap was the argument that in the event of a catastrophe, surely Congress would devote extra resources to relief efforts. A: Is there anything more speculative than guessing what Congress would do in response to something; and B: must have been a sign of the times because today, it would be very much in question if Congress would devote any further resources to relief!) 




 But in practice, it's not so simple. The cynic's view of standing is that it is a doctrine used to decide cases when the Court wants to decide a case and duck cases when it doesn't.

He lit a co-worker's vest on fire. With co-worker still in the vest. How could he not have known he was risking injuries to others?

 If the bill turned out to be counterfeit, not only could you reinstate the fine on the computer, you also had his name, address, and other contact information.

 Casablanca. Just thinking of the opening scene (with the map), I can hear the narrator's voiceover in my head. "....But the others wait in Casablanca. And wait. And wait. And wait." The map itself is visually gorgeous and it the scene sets the tone for what follows. 




 There are plenty of sanctions against the DPRK already, and there isn't much we can do. There was little ability to do much even before North Korea became a nuclear power, and now that they are, there's REALLY not much we can do.

 My condolences on your loss, monolithburger. He looks like a very nice, funny person. You and your family are in my thoughts. 




 I like appointed judges over elected judges. The work of courts is supposed to be apolitical and cases are too nuanced and individualized for campaigning. 

I have never forgotten my freshman government class where we watched campaign videos from judicial elections. There was an attack ad against an incumbent judge blasting him for never once sending a criminal to prison. Well, that was true-the judge did never send a person to prison. The judge was a district court judge, and so only heard misdemeanor cases, where the maximum penalty was 2 and a half years in jail, not prison.

After that, I definitely prefer appointments to elections. 




 The keynote speaker, Dartmouth College Professor Donald Pease, is reputed to be excellent. Friends of mine took classes with him and have universally had nothing but good things to say. 









 Kevin Coughlin's suggestion to require very noticeable green license plates for sex offenders would not protect children, it would lead to executions and assaults of sex offenders. And even for those who believe that's acceptable (and unfortunately, many believe protections of law don't apply to all), the collateral damage of shooting a sex offender driving 55 miles an hour on a highway or the falsely accused offender etc. would be awful.

Not to mention that definitions of sex offender vary considerably. Masturbating in a porn theater, public urination, public sex (which could be getting laid, at night, in the back seat of a car, in a lover's lane or deserted parking lot) flashing, a 17 year old making porn of themselves, high school students sexting, or a high school senior sleeping with a sophomore, can be enough to make the sex offense registry in some states. The sex offense registry has morphed beyond it's purported aims of protecting kidsthere's no evidence that someone busted for some of these offenses make one any more likely to target kids. 




 From what I've gathered, Markey wasn't comparing the substance or equating the two as equally wrong, just that there was an equal need to overturn a S.Ct. precedent. It was a procedural comparison, which Republicans are falsely portraying as a substantive comparison. 




 Replace Geoffrey Rush with Jim Carrey as Lionel Logue in the King's Speech. Just imagine what Logue would teach King George VI to sound like! 




 Study, but don't overstudy. It's a pass-fail exam and every point you get over passing was time you could have spent doing something fun or meaningful. 

Honestly evaluate your skills. How did you do on big closed-book exams in law school? How long did you study and what result did you get? Extrapolate your individual needs and talents to figure out a realistic amount of time you'll need to study.

Beyond that, if you're halfway decent at multiple choice exams, the multistate section is not so bad. And for the essays, treat them like any other issue spotter exam, don't panic, use clear reasoning, and you should do fine. 




 Classic mythology was created by people who were trying to explain the world around them and didn't have the scientific knowledge to give an accurate account. They knew that thunder and lightning occurred, didn't know why, and so they believed that there was some dude on Mount Olympus throwing lightning bolts. And hey, peacocks kind of look like eyes, so, peacocks must be related to eyes! Etc., etc.

People who read news accounts of the legal system don't know the law, don't understand the basics of the system and certainty not the complexities, and so instead, they come up with their own mythology about how the legal system works. The more bits and pieces they come across, the more confirmation bias is at work and convinces them that they are right about how things work. And hey, any little piece that gets rebutted doesn't matter because they aren't experts and it's okay to get a few minor details wrong.

This is how we end up with people claiming that calling something Sprawlmart instead of Wal-Mart or calling it the fast food joint with golden arches saves it from being libel. It's not much different than people running around claiming to be sovereign citizens, claiming the income tax is unconstitutional, or claiming that writing a status message on your Facebook message can exempt you from changes to Facebook's privacy policies. It's the psychology of conspiracy theories, just not applied to conspiracies.

 Ronald Kessler's books are pretty decent... And James Bamford's books on the NSA (The Puzzle Palace/The Shadow Factory/Body of Secrets) were good too.

 There's 2 violinists from a PG County youth orchestra that sometimes played at the top of the Friendship Heights station 3 or 4 months ago. They were really good, the acoustics worked pretty nicely bouncing around the circular stonework (minus the screeching of the escalators), and I tossed a few bucks their way every time and stopped for 5 minutes or so.

Then again, I saw them on my way home. Had I been off to work at the time, I'd probably have just kept going.

Getting in trouble with bosses isn't worth listening to a street musician, even if it's Joshua Bell in disguise. I'd rather get paid and have the money to see him in concert! 




 Dahl also specifically stated, "Theres a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity ... I mean there is always a reason why anti-anything crops up anywhere; even a stinker like Hitler didnt just pick on them for no reason."

Dahl claimed to draw a distinction between being an anti-Semite and being anti-Israel, but it's safe to say he was both. 




 There's a neat museum you may have missed: the Kreeger Museum, in NW near American University. It's a private museum, in the former home of a Geico President, with works from impressionists, American artists, an African art collection, etc. all things that the Kreegers acquired.

It's open to the public Friday and Saturdays without reservations, otherwise, you can call to make a reservation during the week. (They're closed Sundays and Mondays.) The cost of admittance is $10.

 This case should not have gone to the merits.

I join with Columbus School of Law Professor Victor William's difficulty in reconciling Canning v. NLRB with Nixon v. United States, 506 U.S. 224 (1993). Nixon involved the political question doctrine with the Supreme Court deciding that the separation of powers prohibited judicial meddling into/judicial review of the nature of a Senate impeachment trial process that used a committee of 12 senators to actually try the case, and then all 100 senators voting. Professor Williams describes the ruling in Nixon as, "[T]he Court explicitly ruled 'the word try in the Impeachment Trial Clause does not provide an identifiable textual limit on the authority which is committed to the Senate' The nations highest court would not conjure a definition of the word 'try.'" (from http://dccircuitreview.com/2012/12/14/reply-political-question-answer-to-recess-appointment-test/, internal citations omitted.)

Williams then goes on to make that argument that if the Supreme Court wouldn't create or settle on a definition of the word try, courts should not define the word recess either. Quoting the language of Nixon, Williams writes, "Just like the word 'try' in the Impeachment Trial Clause, the word recess in the Recess Appointment Clause 'does not provide an identifiable textual limit on the authority which is committed to the [president].'" (Id., again, omitting internal citation). 




 And she got away with killing Vince Foster, too, right? 




 (And note that I don't give a damn about her political future. I care about protecting the independent judgment of prosecutors, even when I disagree with them.) I am in no way affiliated with Carmen Ortiz, the DOJ, or any government-related organization.) 




 Downvote me all you want, but what precisely is the lesson that you want to teach? 




 MIT didn't call the Secret Service. JSTOR didn't either. MIT called Cambridge Police, Cambridge Police brought Secret Service into it through a member of the Electronic Crimes Task Force.

The Patriot Act established the ECTFs. ECTFs can get involved in crimes with significant community impact. This is a term of art that allows the Secret Service to intervene much more broadly than you suggested, imustbreakyou.

Did the Secret Service have to get involved? No. Is their involvement a sign of a broader, politician-driven conspiracy? Also no. 




 It's not a grand conspiracy. One of the Secret Service's primary areas of responsibility is cybercrimes. It's their area.

I don't see any evidence Swartz's activities were significant enough to rise to the attention of any politicians. 




 I'm not suggesting that they should not both be punishedI'm saying that the punishment for a hacking breaking into a bank's computer to steal money and an 18-y-o high school senior breaking into a school computer to change a failing grade shouldn't be given the same punishment. 




 Unlike some who are (figuratively) seeking US Attorney Carmen Ortiz's head for her office's prosecution of Aaron Swartz [1], the EFF's Marcia Hoffman lays out a practical solutionreform of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. The CFAA is incredibly overbroad. If my technologically-impaired mother, who still once in a while needs a gentle reminder on how copy-and-paste works, is capable of committing a hacking offense under the CFAA, the statute is too damn broad.

A senior lawyer with the DOJ's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section has informally taken the position that merely using an open wifi network that does not, in its name or otherwise, explicitly make it clear that it is open to public use, could be prosecuted under the CFAA. The same for use of a coffee shop's wifi network if not in the coffee shop. Use of a neighbor's unsecured wifi should NOT be a federal crime.

As Hoffman points out, the CFAA does not define what authorization means or requires in the context of the state prohibiting gaining access to someone else's computer "without authorization" or in a manner "exceeding authorized access." The obvious fix is to define what authorization is. This shouldn't be a term of art that can be stretched to fit behavior computer owners or the government does not like. (I'd go so far as to question whether the statute should be deemed void for vagueness, but I'll concede that is impractical-I wouldn't expect a court to actually rule that way.)

The potential punishment for violations of the CFAA are not proportionate to the potential offenses. It's one thing to throw the book at someone who hacks a bank or ATM network to steal money or someone engaging in corporate espionage, and another to throw the book at Swartz, or a college student trying to change grades, or a teen banned from a videogame server trying to find a way around said ban.

I have said elsewhere on Reddit, and I'll repeat here, that I don't believe folks should be making an example of Carmen Ortiz by trying to get her removed, anymore than it was appropriate for Ortiz's office to try to make an example out of Swartz. The problem is not that Oritz and her office violated prosecutorial discretion or exceeded the bounds of the lawthe problem is that her actions and that of her office were entirely within her discretion and that her reading of the CFAA statute was entirely reasonable.

 Yes-there was a short-lived midseason replacement run on CBS called First Monday, starring Joe Mantegna, about the Supreme Court. It was enjoyable, but didn't catch a big audience.... (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Monday) 




 There's nothing nefarious or unusual about this. Cases are dropped when defendants die. It's routine. 




 For some other views on the subject, take a look at Ron Coleman's Likelihood of Confusion blog. http://www.likelihoodofconfusion.com/the-making-martyr/ Coleman argues that the potential penalties are too big, but also, "He did steal that stuff.  Information doesnt want to be free  its stuff, and it wasnt his to free.  I think he should have gotten in trouble."

Professor Ann Althouse argues, "He knew what he was doing was criminal, and he was a very intelligent man who chose to do it anyway and conceived of what he was doing as actively virtuous." http://althouse.blogspot.com/2013/01/aggressive-prosecution-2-internet.html Althouse succinctly summarizes the issue in her second to last paragraph: "But he knowingly and willingly committed numerous felonies, did he not? I'm not hearing the lawyer say that Swartz didn't do what the prosecutors said he did. The argument was that the law ought to be different. If you break the laws as a way to make that argument, how is the prosecutor supposed to respond? Your argument is to the public and to the legislators." 




 I don't think the prosecution of Swartz was necessary, not do I think it was a horrendous abuse of prosecutorial discretion. There's arguments for and against prosecution, and neither option would have fallen outside the bounds of reasonableness or proprietary.

Swartz may have been a real criminal committing real crimes. That he thought he was doing the right thing does not negate the resources that JSTOR put in to stopping his activity. From press reports (and yes, making these judgments from press reports is always dangerous), it appears that Swartz knew MIT and JSTOR didn't want him doing what he was doing.

Your argument that we should never prosecute cases like those against Aaron Swartz, with a link calling for firing Carmen Ortiz, is an absurd one in the absence of a fleshed out argument. Swartz's conduct, at best, fell into a gray area of the law (and I'm not so sure it wasn't clearly a criminal violation under the CFAA). Ortiz's conduct was well within ethical constraints-she did nothing wrong. If people don't like the system, change the system. Calling for the head of one prosecutor for doing her job is a bizarre reaction.

As for my characterizations of your argument, that's what happens when someone makes an assertion but not a real argument. Guessing at what your argument is is all you left us with. 




 A: I didn't argue against you posting a link. I questioned what your argument actually is.
B: You still haven't actually made a cohesive argument. What should prosecutors be aware of?
C: If you disagree with some of my arguments, fine, but it's a wimpy copout to say my arguments, or lawyers' arguments in general, are what's wrong with the justice system without so much as identifying what you are finding objectionable. 




 The maximum potential penalties were outrageous, but the maximum potential penalties for just about any federal prosecution are outrageous. That's why over 90% of federal prosecutions end in a plea bargain.

Is it outrageous to believe that Aaron Swartz violated the Computer Frauds and Abuse Act? No. The statute is incredibly broad. Did Swartz have fair warning that his conduct was not welcome by JSTOR? There's a strong argument that blocking his IP addresses, and later his MAC address, were signs that he was engaging in behavior outside what JSTOR permitted.

His actions impacted MIT's relationship with JSTOR, for a time, JSTOR was unavailable to MIT students and faculty, and while JSTOR may have reached a civil settlement with Swartz, MIT had an interest in his prosecution as well. Moreover, the wishes of a victim are not always followed in criminal casesprosecutions are subject to the decisions of the State and not victims or their families.

None of which is to say that I agree with prosecuting Swartz or even with the scope of the CFAA. Arguing that Carmen Ortiz should be removed from office, or that as lawyers we should never prosecute cases like these, however, are sloppy arguments not based on facts. Swartz's behavior reasonably fit conduct that the CFAA proscribed. It is absurd to blame prosecutors for faithfully prosecuting conduct Congress made illegal.

What exactly are you referring to when you refer to "cases like those against Aaron Swartz"? Cases under the CFAA? Are computer crimes no longer illegal? Or did you mean cases where victims are not interested in prosecuting? In which case, leaving aside MIT's involvement or not in the decision to go after Swartz, I take it you are opposed to prosecuting cases of domestic violence once battered spouses are not interested, or able to express an interest, in further proceedings? This is far more nuanced than is being reported. 




 NESL is well-regarded in the area, but there's no justification for paying their dean higher than Harvard, Yale, etc., or higher than Suffolk University's dean. 




 Free speech does not mean getting to say whatever you want to say without any consequences. It means that (for the most part) government cannot sanction you for speech, but private actors can certainly do so.

Time Warner is a private company. Getting to choose what they do and not put out over their cable networks is an act of free speech in and of itself. 




 As others have pointed out, a thief can't gain title to stolen property. As for the issue of statute of limitations, if committed by a US citizen, stealing a trillion dollars could reasonably be called treason. Treason has no statute of limitations and is a capital offense. 




 It doesn't really matter how bad they look to a general electoratethanks to gerrymandering, the risk to most House Republicans these days isn't a general election, it's the primary. Those who are not ideologically pure are getting well-funded primary opponents. Impeaching a democratic President would be wildly popular with their base, regardless of the merits of such an action. 




 Well, yes, I should rephrase slightly-anything that would otherwise be admissible would be admissible... 




 This. The government did not induce anon's actions in any way, therefore, anything they found can be used against the teens involved. 




 There's an argument to be made, it is by no means a slam dunk, nor is it automatically a loser. If decided on the merits, I suspect the current Court would likely strike down the argument as unconstitutional, but there'd be a reasonable chance the Court would punt and not intervene based on the political question doctrine.

Politically, this would almost certainly lead to an impeachment attempt.  Probably not worth it. 




 Isn't there always mass law student drama? :P Grades, whose dating who, fighting (or threatening to sue) over student bar association elections,....? 




 It's certainly legal to restrict public access to a public building. (Can't just wander into a prison, afterall.) Perhaps it would be better to reframe the issue in terms of the school's obligation to leave students out in the extreme temperatures for unsafe periods of time. That's a far stronger argument (if you can substantiate it). 




 Were there any consequences when that happened? IIRC, there's no private right to sue under FERPA, and I don't think the feds sue over inadvertent disclosures unless there is a history of repeated issues. 




 Offending others is not illegal. Flipping off a cop is constitutionally protected speech. I'm sure folks were offended by a guy in a LA courthouse wearing a jacket saying Fuck the Draft in the midst of Vietnam War. It was, nevertheless, found to be protected speech by the Supreme Court in Cohen v. California. A few years after Cohen was decided, the Supreme Court found it was unconstitutional for a New Orleans ordinance to prohibit cursing at New Orleans police officers. If it's not constitutional to prohibit saying "fuck you" to a police officer, the symbolic equivalent in the form of the middle finger can't be punished either. 




 Yes, refusing police orders can be resisting/obstruction/other types of charges, but if you believe a passenger tried to summon your aid, do you keep him in the car with the driver? That sounds a bit off. 




 Seems like an obvious First Amendment violation. The officer's claim that he took the middle finger to be a potential call for help is incongruous with ordering the person calling for help back into the car while making a traffic stop. It may be an unwise decision to flash the bird at cops, and unsurprising for cops to respond by detaining those who do it, but it is a constitutionally protected expression of free speech. It's no more egregious than the actions of Paul Cohen's wearing a jacket saying "Fuck the draft" in a Los Angeles courthouse, an act of expression the Supreme Court said was constitutionally protected in 1971's Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15. Obscene gestures are similarly speech, not conduct. 




 There are certainly specialists in Supreme Court practiceTom Goldstein, David Frederick, Ted Olson, and others. The NYT wrote an article on the practice in 2010: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/1 /us/10lawyers.html?pagewanted=all  




 I'm not familiar with Texas, but my impression is that in most jurisdictions, criminal defense attorneys are disciplined regularly. Even criminal defense attorneys deal with trust funds, commingling funds issues, etc.

 An obvious Brady violation... Unfortunately, prosecutors are all too rarely disciplined for unethical conduct.

 First Amendment rights have been drastically curtailed in school, certainly, but students do have some level of First Amendment rights in school. See Tinker v. Des Moines. 




 Absolutely! No internet would help me not notice what I'm missing! ;-) (In the interest of honesty, though, I should note I'm already a pescatarian...) 




 We would have been better returning to the days of the Clinton tax rates by going over the cliff. It's not as though the '90s were marked by human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together, and mass hysteria-it was a prosperous time. Now, the House Republicans feel they lost on a big issue, and will be even more motivated to be obstructionist in two months when it comes to the debt ceiling and sequestration. I fear that by not allowing us to go over the cliff and return to Clinton tax rates, something that wouldn't have been catastrophic, it sets us up for failing to raise the debt ceiling and defaulting on our debt. 




 When your party pushes to cut food stamps and welfare, when your party opposes providing healthy school lunches, when your party opposes providing health care to those in need, your party's key platform is turning one's back on people who are starving, freezing, and in need of help.

 Um, no. Hedley Lamarr is a character from Blazing Saddles. The actress/inventor was Hedy Lammar (her full name was Hedwig Eva Maria Lamarr). 




 Hollywood actress Heddy Lamarr was the co-inventor of frequency hopping. The original patent involved  using a piano roll to change between frequencies in the hopes of making torpedoes more difficult to jam. Frequency hopping would later be the basis of spread-spectrum communication technology, including wi-fi-, Bluetooth, CDMA, etc. 




 University of Connecticut offers an LL.M. in Insurance Law that may well be worthwhile, given that so many insurance companies are headquartered in Hartford. AFAIK, that program has a strong reputation. I'm not familiar with any other school's LL.M. program, so, it may depend on individual circumstances, the market at the time you're thinking of going (and when you'd graduate), etc. 




 Historically, the law treats pets as mere property-value of replacing a dog or cat or what have you, nothing more. There is a push to change this, but I'd be surprised if it was judicially imposed, especially in Texas, instead of changed via statute. 




 Heh. No ideaI'll have to ask!

I expected a floppy hat at JD graduation. They showed us floppy hats as samples when signing up to rent our regalia. But nooo.... I pick up my regalia to find that JDs get mortarboards, just like undergrads. Bah! Bah I say! :P 




 This isn't so much a legal question so much as one of philosophy, and is a question with answers that vary depending on where you ask it.

Some US states have abolished the death penalty, but on the other hand, in 2012, nine states executed 43 people. Many believe the death penalty to be cruel, or capricious, at risk of executing the innocent, wrong for the state to kill, or what not, while others believe that the death penalty provides deterrence, promotes public safety, and gives victims' families closure. The clamor for extreme punishment in India is not surprising in light of the conditions there-activists are arguing that violence against women has gone unpunished for a long time, and they are working hard to change this.

It is too big a generalization to take conditions in India as a sign that society overall is moving towards more barbaric punishments. It may be true that some in India are pushing towards more barbaric punishments, but there are also places that are moving away from capital punishment.

Uganda continues to flirt with a bill that would criminalize homosexuality and provide life imprisonment or the death penalty for engaging in same-sex acts, same-sex marriage, and the like. In Europe, the constitutions of Belarus, Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montengero, Poland, Serbia, and Ukraine define marriage as a union between a man and a woman. On the other hand, in the United States, nine states (CT, IA, ME, MD, MA, NH, NY, VT, and WA), DC and the Coquille and Suquamish tribes have legalized same sex marriage. Nine other states (CA, CO, DE, HI, IL, NV, OR, RI, and WI) have domestic partnership options for same-sex couples. In Europe, eight countries allow for same-sex marriage and 13 others allow other forms of partnerships.

Why am I bringing up same-sex marriage/partnerships? Because it demonstrates that you can't draw global conclusions from the acts of an individual nation. Sure, Uganda's continued attempts at passing a "kill-the-gays" bill is very alarming and horrible. But it doesn't mean that society at large is moving towards recriminalizing homosexuality. 




 Up until a few years ago, the value of LL.M. programs was primarily for foreign attorneys looking to practice in the US and American attorneys looking for tax-related jobs. Other than the tax LL.M., LL.M.s in other areas were generally not seen as worthwhile until very recently.

In the current legal market, however, that calculus may have shifted. Gaining a focus in a very specific area, getting to work more one on one with professor advisors, and, for the grads who hit the market in the midst of the '08/'09 collapse who need to reduce or eliminate the effects of resume gaps, resetting that gap, are all things that may make LL.M.s in other subjects make sense now.

I'm about to enter an LL.M. program for specializations in health law and policy and administrative law. Health law and policy is a hot area, expertise is required, and an LL.M. may help me land a job. Moreover, I've seen government job postings where a LL.M. would allow me to start at a higher grade/step or make me eligible period.

Is this a gamble? Absolutely. Going for the LL.M. will either be a brilliant move or incredibly stupid of me. But at least I'll finally get to wear that tam hat I coveted at law school graduation when I saw all I got was a dinky mortarboard while the LL.M. students got the nice hats.  *rueful grin* 




 Your high school grades don't matter once you're in college, so, it's only a concern as far as getting into a good college and how well you think you might do in college.

It's too early to worry about the job market because the job market is in such flux. Yes, the legal market is awful right now. But by the time you'd be looking at applying to law school, all sorts of things will be different. Don't let that discourage you.

A lot of very well-meaning people will tell you that it is too far away to think about careers, that you will likely change what you want to major in and what you want to do. This may be true for some, but not for all. When I was your age, I decided I wanted to major in government in college and go on to law school, and everyone told me I'd change my mind. When I met my college advisor freshman fall and told her I wanted to major in government and go to law school, she told me I'd likely change my mind. I majored in government. I went to law school. (I'm now going back for my LL.M.) I regret graduating in the midst of the law market collapsing-that was an unpleasant surprise-but I still wouldn't change my decisions, and I did exactly what I had been saying I'd do since 9th grade. It can be done. 




 Thanks for the suggestionI was thinking about getting a hand creme since they put hand sanitizer on their hands every time they walk in or out of the room. 




 Ooh-that's a great idea! I hadn't thought of a Starbucks gift card. Thanks! 




 Thanks! Would I be better contacting the Nurse Manager, or the CEO, or....? 




 Thanks-I'll definitely be sending in a thank you note, and I think my Mom will be doing the same. 




 Thanks for the suggestions and for the well-wishes! 




 Thanks! :) 




 *nods* That might be a bit tough to surprise them with...
 




 Ooh-good ideas! Thanks! 









 The average person commits several crimes every day. We can't lockup everyone. (For example, Harvey Silverglate wrote an excellent book on the subject: http://www.amazon.com/Three-Felonies-Day-Target-Innocent/dp/1594035229/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1356098597 sr=8-1 keywords=silverglate )
 




 No reason to hang on to casebooks. Books that have actual explanatory texts (there are a FEW decent casebooks out there) and some supplements like E Es may be worthwhile holding on to for more advanced classes within the subject, but casebooks that are purely edited cases? Useless after the class is done. 




 Adorable! What is your sheltie's name? 




 Claiming that statistics gives probable cause? Good grief. A 1L could get any and all evidence stemming from these illegal stops suppressed. 




 I'm thrilled to read that NBC's Chief Foreign Correspondent and his crew are safe after several days being held captive by an unknown group. I'm a big fan of his.

I am, however, a trifle disturbed that NBC seems to have asked for a media blackout during the days they were missing despite no specific evidence that reporting would endanger them. There seems to be a bit of a double-standard for reporters in harms way versus everyone else.

"According to NBC, there "was no claim of responsibility, no contact with the captors and no request for ransom during the time the crew was missing." Whether or not one agrees with Gawker's decision to run with the story, their determination that there were no specific or even general threats to Engel's safety if the story was publicized seems accurate according to NBC News's own article (in the link).

Would news organizations not report on this sort of thing, in the absence of an articulable, specific concern safety, were it not one of their own?

 Inherit the Wind is not jut my favorite law-related movie, but in a 3-way-tie with Casablanca and Rio Bravo for my favorite moves overall. A wonderful script and even better acting. Spencer Tracy and Frederic March were both amazing, and Gene Kelly's cynical newspaperman, E.K. Hornbeck, might be his finest performance.

My Cousin Vinny is a great movie so long as you are not required to watch it over and over and over again. I loved it, before I had to watch it (or substantive parts of it) in 3-4 law school classes and the bar-mandated professionalism class. Then it got a little old hat. :P

 andrewthestudent's outline provides a great constitutional framework. As for how the death penalty is defended, common arguments are deterrence, closure for victims' families, a need for finality for the system itself, and the need for especially strong punishment for the worst of the worst. Common arguments against the death penalty are that it is wrong for the state to kill, that mistakes can be/have been made and are unavoidable in the future (the work of the Innocence Project has been especially powerful), that the death penalty is more expensive, that the death penalty is arbitrary and capricious, and that the death penalty is both racist and classist (rich people don't get executed).

If you are looking for resources, take a look at the Innocence Project's website, take a look at Amnesty International's website, take a look at http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org , and take a look at http://www.prodeathpenalty.com/articles.htm . 




 Absolutely no reason to use anything extra other than bar prep course materials. The most important thing is to not panic during the exam. Read the question carefully, and respond the way a lawyer would. It is less important to remember case names or even case law than it is to respond in a clear, logical fashion.

Beyond that, I'll pass along the sage advise one of the barbri lecturers told us: every point you get above passing is wasted effort. You don't need to get 100%. You're not looking for an A. You're looking to pass. Don't lock yourself in a law library exclusively for three months. See friends. Read fiction. Go to the movies or the theater. Hell, go to a strip club. Just make sure you are balancing your time so you don't burnout studying.

Study the prep materials, practice the multiple choice questions, get a good night sleep the night before the exam, and don't panic during the exam, and you should do fine. 




 Even if Arafat tests positive for polonium, that would still be insufficient to conclude that Israel was responsible. Turkish sources are reporting that polonium was one of four poisons found in the remains of former Turkish President Turgut Ozal, who died in office in 1993.(Other three poisons being DDT, cadmium, and americium.) Israel had no reason to poison Ozal-Israel/Turkey relations were strong under his rule. If Ozal was actually poisoned with polonium, it demonstrates that there are other actors in the region with access to polonium and a willingness to kill with it.

Has Al Jazeera looked in to the allegations of Ozal being poisoned? Are there any suspects, and did these suspects have reasons to kill Arafat or have ties to those who would have such reasons?

 Respectfully, Congressman Issa, a law can't constrain Congress from exercising its Constitutional authority to pass legislation. If your bill passes and is signed into law, it will constrain agencies and departments, but Congress can still turn around at any point and pass whatever it darn well pleases. It is advisory at best.

Moreover, preventing the FTC, the FCC, and other agencies from regulating or burdening the internet for two years is a very broad prohibition. Prognosticating the future is hard. We don''t know what devices will be created, what services will be created, how they will be used, how they will be abused, how we may want to impose limits on interacting with children, etc.

If in a year, Google announces that it is selling driverless cars (or licensing the technology to car companies so they sell driverless cars) that use the internet for downloading and uploading navigation, traffic conditions, etc., that could be amazing. It could reduce the scourge of drunk driving. It could empower the disabled. It could be turned into a hybrid of car pooling/mass transit. BUT-it also poses questions and concerns and a strong need for regulations from the Department of Transportation to ensure that the technology is safe for users and for everyone else on the road. Burdening or regulating internet-based driverless technology is prohibited by your bill. That's not good.

It's too easy to say that if something comes along that requires regulation, Congress can pass legislation that modifies or overturns this bill. Given the current partisan gridlock and no signs of relations between the sides thawing, it is dangerous to rely on the ability to pass future legislation to fix problems. As much as is possible, potential problems need to be predicted and dealt with in what passes now. 




 Kathy Greenwood. 
























 As someone who was born 100% deaf and had surgeries as an infant that restored my hearing to relatively "normal" range, I am baffled, putting it mildly, that there is a segment of the Deaf community that attacks cochlear implants for treating deafness as a disability and not a cultural identity. Have you encountered any hostility for having the implants, and how have you dealt with it? 




 Bench trial. No jury, so verdicts can be a heck of a lot faster. 




 Didn't mean to criticize-I was just confused. It was an interesting (and I'm  sure, frustrating for you) story, and I'm glad you shared it! 




 Note: I am not your attorney, I'm not giving you legal advice other than to tell you to seek counsel in your area, I am not advising you on courses of action to take or when things have to be done.

Disclaimer out the way, if you're in Montgomery or PG county, I might be able to give you some names of attorneys in the area.

It's a misdemeanor-a crime that carries a potential fine and/or potential jailtime as well as MVA points. It's probably a decent idea to consult with an attorney in your county-this isn't a mere parking ticket. 




 I strongly urge you to consult a lawyer to advise you how to handle the charges. For one thing, you'll want to investigate if being found guilty or pleading to the Utah charges could affect your current probation. 




 I am not licensed in Minnesota. I cannot give you legal advice. 

I'd continue to keep an eye on the MN case records, but I'm not sure what you could gain by contacting the court or DA's office yourself. If you are concerned, you could/should contact a local defense attorney. He or she can advise you what to do next, if anything, and if it becomes necessary to speak to the court or the DA's office, he/she can do so on your behalf. Remember-anything you say can and will be used against you. That's not just a TV line. 




 Unfortunately, this sort of thing is a common scam as others have noted. It sucks, not just because you're out $50, but also because it means that when folks are in situations where they legitimately need emergency cab fare etc., it's impossible to differentiate oneself from a scammer.

You could contact the local police, since you have their phone number and it actually goes to them, but if it goes to a burner phone, or if your local police are a busy bunch, you're sadly out of luck. :( Sorry. 




 Thank you. :-) 




 That saidI'm not convincing you, you're not convincing me, and nobody else is participating or paying attention. We might as well agree to disagree and leave it at that. 




 Depends who you ask.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/24/AR2010112404510.html 




 Your hypothetical: "if a Senator proposed a sweeping ban on "obscenity". There's already a sweeping ban of obscenity, as you seem well aware. 




 You proposed a faulty hypothetical for a law and actions that already exist, and I'm splitting hairs for pointing out your hypothetical is pretty much already in place?

Senator Feinstein didn't claim that she was qualified to write a law because of her experience with the shooting, she pointed to her 20 years on that Senate Committee and 9 years of experience as a mayor, too.

Yes. There is no exactly analogous ban on obscenity. What this has to do with the price of tea in China, however, escapes me. Getting back to the original argument, that we have plenty of limitations and exceptions to other Constitutional protections like the 1st and 4th Amendments, not specifically enumerating what is and is not obscene is not something that makes it less of a limitation on First Amendment protections. I'd argue that it is a greater limitation because of the chilling effect and, I'd argue (and lose in court, but I'd argue it anyway), that the nebulous definition of obscenity violates the void for vagueness doctrine. 




 Ah! That would make sense. 




 Is there context that we're (or at least I'm) missing, or did this woman randomly decide she won a prize? 














 And if you insist on a Senator arguing for prosecution of obscenity, instead of merely the Romney campaign and GOP '12 party platform, how about a letter signed by 42 Senators (the vast bulk of them Republicans but some Democrats, including Senator Feinstein), calling for prosecuting all major producers and distributors of adult obscenity, with a focus on internet porn. http://www.politico.com/static/PPM153_obsc.html 




 Here's how I can claim obscenity prosecution was a top priority of the Bush Justice Department: http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1125318960389 slreturn=20130216131119

As for your complaint we've moved from your original point, let's recap. Your original point was that if a Senator proposed a sweeping ban on obscenity, you'd hope other Senators would be as zealous (your word, I'd choose others) as Cruz was the other day with the 2nd Amendment.

When I pointed out we already had a sweeping ban on obscenity, you complained I pointed to caselaw and not a statute. When I pointed out the statute, you complained it was little used. When I pointed out that it was a major priority of the George W. Bush Justice Department, you complained that the small percentage of convictions was negligible. When I pointed out that the Republican party and Mitt Romney stated their intent to do exactly what you claimed would be outrageous (going after a wide range of porn on the web and elsewhere), you ignored it.

Which one of us is moving the conversation away from its original point, hmm? 




 Wouldn't the wiser course be to contact the cops and ask them to deal with it? If there are drugs, guns, etc. inside, do you really want any level of responsibility for it? 




 Peter David's "Q-In-Law" is a classic.... 




 I agree entirely-two years as a sample size is not enough to determine whether global climate change IS affecting tornado season. I was more interested in the bottom third of the article where it discusses the competing forces on how global climate change COULD affect tornado season. 




 This is a bit of an odd role reversal given my original comment, but it appears you are arguing based on passion and I am using facts.

How many people are currently prosecuted under the federal obscenity statute? Not many, perhaps, but during the GWB Administration, the DOJ taskforce targeted some big fish, and all it takes is a few selective prosecutions to have a massive chilling effect. You didn't see the internet suddenly devoid of porn, but more fringe pornographers did close shop for fear of prosecution.

Big names that were targeted include Paul Little (AKA "Max Hardcore") sentenced to 4 years in prison(1), Ira Isaacs (who came to public attention for distributing the 2 Girls, 1 Cup video) was sentenced to 4 years in prison(2), the DOJ prosecuted John Stagliano for milk fetish porn(3), and a woman named Karen Fletcher was prosecuted for "fantasy stories...pedophilia, torture of children, and murder of children."(4) Fletcher's work was disgusting, but it was also purely text-no children harmed in the making of the work and all.

I can do better than naming a Senator-how about a major party's platform and a party nominee for President? Yes, that's right, the Republican Party platform in 2012 stated, "Current laws on all forms of pornography and obscenity need to be vigorously enforced," and the folks who pushed for this language made clear that they meant going after porn on the internet, on pay-per-view in hotels, in retail shops, and on pay-per-view on cable/satellite TV. (5) Mitt Romney himself called for strict obscenity prosecutions. (6)

**the tl;dr version is (1) that Bush made obscenity prosecution a major feature of his Justice Department; and (2) that the most recent Republican Platform and Mitt Romney made it clear they intended to use current obscenity law on the books to go after 100s of types of images and movies, and if Senators or others raised hell, we seem to have both missed it.**

 I'm merely a consumer of weather-related information, but to my novice eyes, this seemed like an interesting look at how warming trends may increase convective available potential energy while decreasing wind shear. 









 There IS a sweeping ban on obscenity. Under Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973), obscene material is not protected by the First Amendment. 




 Good for you! That sort of mistreatment of employees is beyond unacceptable. 




 Ted Cruz's condescending treatment of a fellow Senator was disgraceful, and your link's describing Senator Feinstein as "lash[ing] out with emotion and hyperbole" continues the misogyny. (Taking a thesaurus to "hysterical" doesn't make the sentiment any better.)

Senator Feinstein wasn't a recalcitrant witness. She was not there to be cross-examined. Cruz was free to make his argument, as silly as it may seem. (There ARE limits to the First Amendment. Child porn is but one-material support to terrorists, fire in a crowded theater, fighting words, obscenity, time, place and manner restrictions, etc. There ARE limits to the Fourth Amendmentvehicles is certainly a huge one.) But Senator Feinstein was free to make her points, and was under no obligation to answer Cruz's haranguing questions. 

Senator Feinstein made her points based on her years of experience as a US Senator and politician, her experience with the previous assault weapons ban, and her experience putting her finger through a bullet hole on Harvey Milk's neck as she tried to see if he had a pulse. 




 Wired magazine has a decent writeup explaining the court's ruling and its significance. http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/03/nsl-found-unconstitutional 














 Um, story time? When was this? Do you know what happened next? 









 The only advice I can give you is a caution that "If anyone has experience with copyright law (particularly in Canada)" isn't the right inquiry. The only thing that matters to you (assuming that you're in Canada!) is Canadian copyright law. The copyright law in the US, UK, or the Federated States of Micronesia won't help you in an actual legal dispute (as opposed to an academic conversation).

Try finding a clinic, a public interest group (like the EFF in the US), or whatnot to help if you can. Otherwise, please do speak to a lawyer in your jurisdiction. 




 The kid on both teams wasn't Danny Alamonte. This wasn't a 13 or 14-year-old ringer on the 10-12 year-old team. I don't see how this team got an unfair advantage from the kid playing on two teams, and it seems really cruel to strip them of the opportunity to play this weekend. Surely this could be dealt with without the need for collective punishment of kids. 














 If the accident was indeed both of your faults, you might not be entitled to anything from the insurance company. Or what you're entitled to may be reduced. Or you might be able to recover in full with pain and suffering damages. It depends on the state, and a lawyer can help ensure you don't screw yourself over. Proceed without a lawyer and you're likely to eff yourself over. 




 That's adorable! What is the kitten's name? 




 Where in the county? I've had good luck with Medstar Health. I go to their location in Spring Valley, about 3 blocks past the Bethesda/DC border on the DC side, but they have lots of locations throughout the metro area.

Since they're associated with Georgetown Hospital, I'm pretty sure Medstar Health takes most insurances. 




 But there was no evidence, to my knowledge. 




 Incredibly misleading way of phrasing it. Your phrasing suggests that an Israeli film crew actually did hand out candy to get people to dance. 




 Not a huge fan, but I supposed given the conservative nature of the present cardinals, there are few options I would have been a fan of. His position and his past statements on same-sex adoption are particularly disappointing.

 The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a non-partisan office, scored the Affordable Care Act ("Obamacare") as reducing the deficit. Republicans such as Paul Ryan continue to make false claims that repealing Obamacare would aid with deficit reductions when in reality, it would increase the national debt.

Why isn't the President, and the White House, being more forceful in rebutting these false claims? I understand that the President is trying to reach a "grand bargain," and to do so, he is trying to court Republican votes (or at least stop obstructionism), but by not going on television and repeatedly demonstrating that these claims about Obamacare are not true, it allows conventional wisdom to form that Obamacare does raise the debt. That's not helpful for an eventual grand bargain. That undermines national support for the President and for his policies and continues to ossify public perception that the GOP's plans would lower the debt and not merely shift the tax burden from the wealthy to the poor and middle class. 




 This doesn't make a great deal of sense. Yes, he was on sick leave for an extended period of time, but if this was cause to fire him, why wait until now to sack him? The vast majority of the comments have focused on how long he was on sick leave, but that is irrelevant to why he was sacked.

Looking at the stated reason to why he was sacked, according to the Independent, is that if he was well enough to travel to Australia, and well enough to grapple the shark, he should be well enough to work. This does not seem logical. For the sake of argument, let's view things in the light most favorable to Mr. Marshallsea. Being on leave for stress shouldn't mean he is on bed rest, going on vacation seems like a reasonable response. Whether it is in Australia or London shouldn't make a difference. That he was capable of grappling with a shark is not particularly of import because he was not on leave with a physical disability like a bad back, injured shoulder, or what not.

Given that going on a vacation is a decent way of dealing with stress, and that his reason for being on leave was psychological and not physical, what difference does it make that he went to Australia or grappled with a shark? 




 Hmm-perhaps that's what she was going for, but even then, as a former ANC Chairperson, I'd think she'd constitute a public official, and her statements were certainly an issue of public concern, namely alleged corruption and theft of public funds. 




 Good question, and I'm not sure what the best move is. One of the risks of truth serum is not just that one might be found sane, but that one might say something damaging in response to a question that might have led to pleading the Fifth had one been in one's right mind. 




 There's a surprising dearth of articles on the subject, but there are some, and they support what the Guardian reported.

 I agree-it sounds like bad science and like something that should not be admissible, but it also sounds like something that should not even be permitted to be attempted.

You and I are in agreement that this should not be admissible, but I respectfully disagree with your assessment of this as bad reporting. Sounds like the Guardian got the events right, and the judge may have (I hope) gotten the law wrong. 




 I hope it's only bad reporting-if it is as described, it seems rather horrifying. What part of the report are you disputing? 














 I'm not a DC licensed attorney. My understand of DC civil procedure is that the DC courts give a more generous view of pleading than other jurisdictions, but even then, to my eyes, the complaint embedded in the linked article seems incredibly flimsy.

1: The statute Ms. Seegars cites does not state what I think she thinks it does. She cites 23-542 which discusses wire interceptions and interception of oral communications, and yes, certain conduct is prohibited by this section. Unfortunately for Ms. Seegars, 23-542(b)(3) states that "it is not unlawful under this section for...a person not acting under color of law to intercept a wire or oral communication, where such person is a party to the communication." Joshua Johnson was a party to the conversation, he recorded the conversation, and unless he recorded it with the intent of using it to commit a crime or other injurious act, it's okay under the statute. In other words, DC is a one-party-consent jurisdiction, both parties were in DC, are DC residents, Ms. Seegars is suing in DC court, and the statute she cites is one of the defendant's best defenses. Bwah?

2: The statute she cites is not related to libel and slander. It's a wire/oral communications interception statute. Bwah?

3. She does not specify in her complaint what exactly she is claiming to be libel and slander. As far as I know, and if I recall correctly, DC does not share the same heightened pleading requirements for defamation that other jurisdictions have in place, but even then, the allegations need to be specific enough to allow a defendant to form a responsive pleading. Merely saying "libel and slander", without specifying what the defamatory remarks are, is not sufficient to my knowledge.

4. Unless there are remarks the article is not referencing, it would appear the defamatory statements are things she herself said. In which case, bwah?

Is there a logic or merit that anyone sees to this pleading, or is it the rantings of a pro se plaintiff abusing the legal system?

 Indiscriminate? Hypothetically speaking, if the strike that killed the infant in question WAS an Israeli, would it have been indiscriminate, or would the determination that "Palestinian militants were firing rockets at Israel not far from the al-Masharawi home" persuade you that an errant strike, while awful, happens in wartime? Collateral damage is not avoidable-mistakes happen. 




 She was thinking about buying flowers and therefore she should still get the promotion? By that logic, a guy who was thinking about going to medical school until he flunked organic chemistry and switched his major to film should still get to practice medicine. 




 There are sites where you can do research for free. If you're having trouble using them, well, as I said. Law is hard for the layperson. 




 Law is hard. You can't just google symptoms and get a sense of what the range of options is. Every case is different. Your options, how much you can recover, statutes of limitations, etc., all turn on the individual facts of your case, and moreover, it's not just what the facts are, but what facts you can prove and how you can prove them.

There are real reasons why lawyers licensed in jurisdiction A can't practice in jurisdiction B without getting admitted to the bar or being allowed to hire local counsel. The cynical, and partially accurate reason, is a monopolistic attempt by each state bar to protect local attorneys, but the other reason is that every state's laws and rules differ, and even in areas of law with a lot of similarities between states, it's easy to screw things up.

Saving yourself the legal equivalent of a callout and labor can quickly lead to completely screwing yourself and leaving you with no remedy or no defense (depending on which side you're on). 




 The customer isn't always right, but the customer is sometimes right. Had the exception been printed on the receipt as it was supposed to be, fine, but it wasn't. That's not on the customer. That's on the store. Shifting explanations to vague "health and safety" concerns would likely only make one more suspicious/angry.

You wrote "I'm getting a bit tired of her, and she's clearly just lying at this point", but it would have been perfectly reasonable for the customer to have been getting tired of you and thinking you were lying, given you claimed something could not be returned due to a clear policy on the receipt, that turned out to not be on the receipt.

Not your fault it wasn't on the receipt, not okay for her to yell at you, but even leaving aside your later comments/actions, the customer wasn't wrong to expect a return if the policy wasn't given to her.

 I don't understand how there hasn't been an immediate response from Congress to place compounding pharmacies under the auspices of the FDA, given the amount of harm NECC caused and the high possibility that it could happen with other compounding pharmacies.

This isn't to say that compounding pharmacies should have to follow all of the same requirements of manufacturingmanufacturing in large quantities poses much higher risks that what compounding pharmacies are supposed to be doing, namely creating 1 medication for 1 patient. But placing them under the umbrella of the FDA's regulation and giving the FDA the authority to inspect them, demand compounding pharmacies follow Good Manufacturing Practices, and the like should not be overly burdensome for small businesses.

I was at a T-intersection, where the road becomes two-lanes a few feet further on the right of the intersection, but traffic coming from the left is still one lane. A car to the left stopped and waved for me to go (since the traffic light a block up on the right was red). After checking for traffic coming from the right, I started to make my left turn at the T intersection, only to have a bumper-to-bumper strike on a car that went around the car that stopped for me on the left (slightly going over the double-yellow to pass). Neither of us could see the other based on lines of sight until getting past the stopped car where we collided.

Unfortunately, the only car that stopped was the one that hit me, not the person who stopped to let me in, and the driver of that car claimed to not have noticed passing a car.

Since I couldn't prove the other car was there and the other driver couldn't prove it wasn't, and since we had the same insurance company, the insurance co. said it was assigning fault equally. Not much damage to either car, scratches to the paint, really, but I'm still ticked off about this one.

Had I had a dash cam, I could have proven I was not at fault.

In the event of more serious incident, a dash cam can definitely be useful. 




 You have GOT to be kidding. Palestinians are NOT Israeli Muslims. One can argue about whether there is a distinct Palestinian identity or whether Palestinians are displaced Jordanians, but nobody credible on any side of the argument defines Palestinians as Israeli Muslims. 




 Employers can generally monitor company email at all times, but there ARE exceptions. If there is a published policy in place stating that the employer will not snoop in email except in certain circumstances, said employer cannot snoop in email except in certain circumstances.

All the comments here saying variants of "it's their server, they can do as they please" misses the issue. The issue is whether or not the deans in question fall into the category of faculty or not. If they are not faculty, then yes, the general staff policy allows Harvard to do as it pleases. If they are faculty, however, and there seems to be a strong case to be made that they are, the faculty policy seems to prohibits Harvard from taking the actions it did. 




 Um, it's almost certainly not the IT Department's policy, it's likely the law. 




 Dawww.... Very sweet looking. 




 Good grief-in my jurisdiction, removing a shopping cart from a store's property is a crime carrying a $25 fine, and there's legislation pending that would raise the fine to $100. 

I'm amazed the EC was stupid enough to complain that the carts she swiped were accumulating, and for that matter, I'd even be appalled if she was complaining that other people caused the accumulation. 




 Wow. I am impressed! (And my apologies for suggesting you erred.) 




 $5 each for the skittles or $50? (I'm trying to picture what $50 of skittles would be!) 




 Fortunately, it's not up to doctors. HIPAA requires giving patients access. 




 Depends. Some allergies can kill people. Others can make people pretty darn sick. (My mother is allergic to dairy products, and sadly, lactaid and other types of meds don't help.)

On the other hand, according to a 2008 article in the British Medical Journal, many "allergies" are actually a manifestation of mass psychogenic illness (AKA epidemic hysteria). http://christakis.med.harvard.edu/pdf/publications/misc/023.pdf If this article is accurate, it makes sense for food allergies to come in waves. 




 What is the process for writing the Rachel Maddow Show? What is the blend of direction from you versus from producers versus what your staff comes up with? What is the process for becoming a staff member? 




 It's state specific. In Massachusetts, some vehicle-related offenses are criminal, and some are Civil Motor Vehicle Infractions. See http://www.mass.gov/courts/courtsandjudges/courts/districtcourt/faq/faqs-cmvi.html#1 . 




 I disagree. The difference might be meaningful if judicial review down the line gave further process, such as a right to a de novo hearing somwhere along the way. It didn't. And so it creates a fiscal balance for due process in the civil arena, and not just in the administrative law arena. 




 Many, even most of the characteristics of a criminal charge? Sure. But it is still a civil violation, and therein lies all the difference in the world.

It's a civil matter, and just as in other civil contexts, there can be a filing fee. The state never pays a filing fee, but it's not exactly the initiator. (Not that it would matter if they were. To quote Mel Brooks, "It's good to be the King." The State doesn't pay filing fees. And why would it? Who would collect it? The State!) Anyhow, the initiating party, when it comes to this review process, is the person with a ticketit's an appeal.

How is Matthews on point? Because of the language I cited. The Massachusetts judicial system was (and is) underfunded, and the courts responded by putting a fee in place, both to raise revenue and cut down the amount of appeals. Unfair? Absolutely. Contrary to due process? I'd say so, but the Supreme Court doesn'tTHAT is the point of Matthews. Conserving scarce fiscal and administrative resources and balancing harm suffered to individuals versus the cost of providing due process.  




 Almost certainly not. Woman who received the package did not realize the package was misdelivered until after she opened it. Moreover, she did not lie about possessing it. She said she didn't have the package and she no longer had the package, both true statementsthe police had already come and taken it. 




 Violates ABA standards and the school could theoretically be penalized if it fails to penalize Cody Wilson. I doubt anything will come of it, but it was pretty stupid of Mr. Wilson to admit his skipping classes on the record. 




 I agree that it seems remarkedly unfair. Hell, it IS remarkedly unfair. But it's constitutional.

Matthews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), is a Supreme Court case that discusses the impact of finances in due process. The Court essentially comes out and admits that fairness and process can have a price tag attached. 

The Court says, "Financial cost alone is not a controlling weight in determining whether due process requires a particular procedural safeguard prior to some administrative decision. But the Government's interest, and hence that of the public, in conserving scarce fiscal and administrative resources is a factor that must be weighed. At some point, the benefit of an additional safeguard to the individual affected by the administrative action and to society in terms of increased assurance that the action is just may be outweighed by the cost."

(Before I get blasted or downvoted for laying this out, please note that I disagree with Matthews v. Eldridge, and I disagree that entry-level appeals of tickets to a clerk-magistrate should involve a non-refundable fee, but sadly, nobody in power asked me. :P) 




 Even if someone legitimately has a seizure-how does that translate to free food? You call 911, they check him out, take him to the hospital if need be, etc., where does free food come into the picture?

(I know, I know, I'm trying to understand insane troll logic, but just...erngh! The stupidity burns.) 




 Not necessarily. It really is a state-specific analysis. 




 Board of Education v. Earls (2002). Reading the majority opinion alone, it may not seem terrible, but compare the reasoning with that of its predecessor, Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton, which the majority supposedly relied on as precedent, and you'll see how the Court completely ignores all the key factors that made warrantless, suspicionless drug testing okay in Vernonia.

In Vernonia, the school had a real problem with drugs, limited the testing to student athletes who had unique safety concerns given the potential harm drugs could do to students with that level of exertion, involved a population that already was used to a lesser degree of privacy due to situations involving communal nudity (i.e. locker rooms) (and yes, this is a dumb argument in my view but still, not mere dicta to be ignored in future rulings the way the Court did in Earls!), etc.

Compare that reasoning, which the Court claims to rely to Earls, with the situation in Earls. In Earls, the school did NOT have a serious drug problem, it involved students involved in any extracurricular (and it's hard making a plausible argument that students in show choir or on a chess team present an elevated safety risk), and the unique lesser expectations of privacy of people used to locker room situations did not exist.

Instead, the Court took a South Park's Mr. Mackayian view of the situation, said "Drugs are bad, mmkay", and handwaved their way past precedent. O'Connor said as much in her dissent in Earls. (Well, minus the South Park reference.) 




 Yeesh. Glad to hear things worked out for you! I admire your restraint. 




 All the drama you can shake a stick at with very little authority to get much accomplished beyond throwing some social events. You'd be better devoting the time to being a staff member of a journal or brief. 




 Any advice may be state specific. Unfortunately, many, many states still permit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientationyou may not have a remedy if you complain and get fired. I suggest talking to a local plaintiff-side employment lawyer. 




 Yeah. She was going to steal it. Even had you not seen the box knife, her response suggests she was going to steal it. 




 I have to give you points. You called this one. 




 That looks delicious! Thanks for posting! 




 What's really scary is that the way you were treated is pretty much standard operating procedure, and its why false confessions can be such a big problem for the criminal justice system.

Put teens, or those with some form of mental issues, or even just scared adults in an interrogation room for many, many hours (sometimes double-digits), with police officers lying about what they know, intentionally or unintentionally coaching suspects with what the "right" answer, saying "just admit ____ and we can all go home", etc., and you end up with people falsely confessing to homicides, rapes, pretty much you name it. 




 I have the same set and I really like them. Cook's Illustrated rated them highly-it's why I bought them. 




 What are you used to? That's the only criteria that really matters.

When I was a JD student between '05-'08, the school was still majority PC but barely. Now that I'm back as an LL.M. student, I was surprised that the vast majority of laptops are macs. At least 70%ish. 




 A Restaurant Opportunities Centers United Report, admittedly a biased source but most sources are, claims that employers frequently fail to actually pay out more than $2.13 when tips are not high enough to bring an hourly wage to at least $7.25. (ROC-United, Behind the Kitchen Door: A Multi-Site Study of the Nations Restaurant Industry (BKD), 2011.) http://rocunited.org/2011-behind-the-kitchen-door-multi-site-study/ ) 




 Ad hominem attacks are not helpful, and your assumption that people tip at a constant 15% is a rather large assumption. Plenty of people don't tip-see http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/23/tipped-workers-left-out-as-minimum-wage-rises/ where a bartender talks about foreign tourists unaware of the custom.

Many servers DO make more than the $7.25 minimum wage. Many make at least around the $7.25 minimum wage. And a more useful point to make, which I should have conceded in my first post, is that the $2.13 wage is allowed only if tips bring up the total wage to at least the $7.25 minimum wage. BUT-reports claim that employers frequently fail to actually pay out more than $2.13 when tips are not high enough to bring an hourly wage to at least $7.25. (see ROC-United, Behind the Kitchen Door: A Multi-Site Study of the Nations Restaurant Industry (BKD), 2011.) http://rocunited.org/2011-behind-the-kitchen-door-multi-site-study/

Tipped workers are often forced to participate in a shared-tip pool, bringing down their total earnings, sometimes below $7.25 an hour. 

Restaurants with policies that make servers responsible for dine and dashers or for meals sent back can also reduce wages below $7.25 an hour.

The low minimum wage for tipped workers is one more reason for a gender pay gap. According to http://www.nelp.org/page/-/rtmw/ROC_GenderInequity_F1.pdf?nocdn=1 , non-tipped workers (minimum wage of $7.25) are 52% mage, while tipped workers are 66% female (with sub-minimum wage of $2.13). 




 This is unconscionable. The cost of bread, milk, public transportation, gas, etc., between 1991 and 2013? Heck, I was in second grade the last time the minimum wage for tipped workers was raised. I'm now an attorney. WTF? 









 The minimum wage for tipped workers is $2.13. It has stayed at $2.13 since 1991! (Since 1991, for non-tipped workers, the federal minimum wage has been raised five times and has gone from $4.25 in 1991 to $7.25.)

Think of how much bread, milk, gas, public transportation, etc. cost in 1991 versus now.

You don't have to tip for crappy service, but sequestration is NOT an excuse for not tipping. 




 Sometimes Reddit confuses me. Collective outrage at prosecuting Aaron Schwartz and cries for more exercise of prosecutorial discretion, but then in a thread like this, many suggestions that the authorities should intervene when a neighbor puts a note in another neighbor's mailbox. 




 I can't offer you legal advice, but you may want to consult with a lawyer in your jurisdiction. Generally, a false accusation of stealing is slander. 




 As _yours_truly_said, I would take a big grain of salt from the pessimistic attitude towards classmates and professors. The method can be worthwhile, as far as getting certain books and reading ahead to know the black letter bedrocks of subjects before the classes start. 




 Um, no? But if they are aware of a patron that is intoxicated to that extent, in many states, they may have certain legal duties to summon or render aid beyond placing a guy in the passenger seat of his car. 




 Fair enough. :-) 




 I can also imagine the liability if a bar did not do this and it had tragic consequences... 




 I'm a fan of personal responsibility and most of the blame falls on the dude who vomited everywhere and passed out. But. Doesn't some of the responsibility fall on the bar for overserving? (At least it would in some states.)

Also, if someone is that intoxicated, isn't a call to 911 more appropriate than dumping him in the passenger seat of his car? Alcohol poisoning can be fatal. 




 It's worth noting that according to USA Today, McMillan was indeed murdered and a person of interest is in custody. http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/02/28/gay-murder-mississippi-politics/1953187/

*edited to change word "suspect" to "person of interest" 
























 When applying to the bar, they'll probably want to know. If you were a 0L applying to law schools, you'd probably have to disclose it then. I can't imagine why you'd have to disclose it to your school as a current student. (I also can't imagine how disclosing it to your school would hurt you in any way if you felt compelled to tell them.) 




 Also, nearly every law school offers its students access to CALI lessons and nearly every law student stops looking at them after 1L year. I think that's a mistake. CALI lessons can be valuable for hints at the sort of things professors in that area of law might test. 




 This all depends on what your prof covered/emphasized, obviously. If you had my professor, beyond Chevron/Skidmore/Auer, you'd need to be prepared for questions about the type of evidence permitted in adjudications (hearsay is often okay, ex parte is not, etc.), when can agency heads be removed (Myers, Humphrey's Executor, Wiener), when is formal rulemaking required, issues of delegation, what information must be given as part of rule making (underlying data, concise general statement of basis and purpose, etc.),  when is ex-parte communication accepted or at least non-fatal in rulemaking, issues of reviewability (standing, ripeness, mootness, exhaustion, preclusion, review of agency inaction), due process concerns (Goldberg, Matthews v. Eldridge, where property interests come from, etc.), definitions of substantial evidence, separation of powers, ... These were the key concepts I focused on. 




 The FDA is not looking at coffee or cola, but at other products. 




 It is inaccurate to say that the FDA intends to potentially regulate caffeine. Caffeine is already regulated. The FDA is looking into potentially enforcing its existing powers that it has, to date, not exercised much towards caffeinated products.

Food, drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, and food additives are all regulated under the federal Food, Drugs, and Cosmetics Act (FCDA). An important aspect of the FDCA is classifications. Food, drugs, cosmetics, medical devices, food additives, color additives, etc., all are definitional categories with different types and burdens of regulations. Often, the classification is based on the intended use of a substance or item, and caffeine is no different.

Caffeine is regulated based on its intended use. Caffeine in food is not a dietary supplement, it is a food additive and one must show that it is safe. Caffeine in pill form is a drug. Certain products containing caffeine are dietary supplements which is a category of food with special requirements.

When the FDA is speaking about increasing its oversight of caffeine in food products, it's not talking about going after coffee. Caffeine is a natural, non-added constituent in coffee. The same can't be said of many of the other products caffeine has been added to. The FDA is concerned about the use of caffeine as a food additive as well as the blurring distinction between foods and dietary supplements.

Foods are consumed primarily for its taste, aroma, or nutritive value. Food additives are defined in FDCA 201(s) as "any substance the intended use of which results or may reasonably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, in its becoming a component or otherwise affecting the characteristics of any food [omitting the subsequent exceptions]."  Food additives must be Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS). There is no premarket approval process before an item can be sold, nor is there a definitive FDA-issued list of everything that is GRAS, instead, manufactures have the option of notifying the FDA of their belief something is GRAS before marketing or they can just put it on the market and wait to see if the FDA objects. 

The key element is that GRASness is not inherent in the ingredient, but in the intended use. The FDA recognized caffeine as GRAS in soft drinks, but that determination only applies to soft drinks. All other food products beyond soft drinks that include caffeine have not received prior sanction from the FDA, merely a history of inaction which can change at any time. The FDA would not be adding a new regulation, merely choosing to exercise its existing authorities to declare that an additive (caffeine) is not GRAS in a certain use or form.

Dietary supplements are defined by FDCA 201(ff) as products which contain a vitamin, mineral, herb or other botanical, amino acid, a dietary substance to supplement the total dietary intake, etc. and are not represented for use as a conventional food or as a sole item of a meal or the diet. One problem the FDA has with current dietary supplements is that they are being sold in a way that does not distinguish them from conventional foods. (See http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-09-09/health/ct-nw-supplements-quiz-20110909_1_dietary-supplements-energy-drinks-american-herbal-products-association which discusses a food energy drink and a dietary supplement being sold in the same cooler.) Foods have certain safety requirements that dietary supplements do not. Their ingredients are not reviewed for safety in the way that ingredients are for food, or for safety and efficacy the way drugs are reviewed.

The TL;DR version of all is (1) The FDA isn't coming for your coffee; (2) the FDA is not creating new regulatory requirements; and (3) the FDA is considering enforcing its existing authority because of safety concerns and because the public might be mislead into thinking products have been evaluated for safety in a way they actually have not. 




 There is a bus between Brattleboro and Bennington: http://www.moover.com/routes-timetables/bennington 




 When Democrats accused the Bush Administration of engaging in torture, illegal warrantless wiretapping, going to war under false pretenses, and other assorted high crimes and misdemeanors, we were accused of "Bush derangement syndrome."

The feigned outrage of Benghazi is little different from Whitewater (which despite actually stumbling across Monica Lewinsky during its fishing expedition, never found any wrongdoing by the Clintons related to the stated purpose of the investigation) or from those who accused the Clintons of murdering Vince Foster. Say what you will about Democrats, but at least we accuse Republicans of shit they've actually done. 




 AFAIK, without a car, not really. There's no direct bus from Boston or from Hanover, you'd have to take a bus from Hanover to Boston, from Boston to Albany, and then from Albany to Rutland.

Do you have a license? If so, find out if you can rent a car from Rent a Wrecksome locations have lower age requirements than Hertz, Avis, National, etc. 




 I'm not a Prenda fan and I hate being Mr. No. Fun, but while I enjoyed the Star Trek references in Judge Wright's opinion, I find myself agreeing with Mr. Steele that they seem inappropriate in a serious judicial order. It's one thing to slyly slip one or two in, or to have fun in an opinion about a talking cat (if you haven't read it, google Blackie the Talking Cat), and another thing entirely to include many unrelated pop culture references in a serious sanction order accusing people of misconduct. (See pg. 22 of the Federal Judicial Center's Judicial Writing Manual. http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/JudicialWritingManual.pdf/$file/JudicialWritingManual.pdf)  




 While the common law in the US has generally treated pets as property for which one can receive monetary compensation for things like vet bills or the value of the pet (not encompassing any damages for the emotional attachment and the likejust the replacement cost), this is slowly changing in some US jurisdictions. Courts in California, Florida, Washington, and Louisiana have allowed mental suffering damages related to a wrongful death or injury of a pet, for example.

Whatever source you find for UK tort law, make sure that you check to see if there are new developments in the field. 




 Every legal group constantly holds its views out as law whether it's the liberal ACLU or conservative ACLJ. Every conservative talking head on TV arguing that the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate was clearly unconstitutional (while ignoring that it was originally the idea of the ultra-conservative Heritage Foundation and part of the GOP's own healthcare plan in 1993, before being adopted by Mitt Romney in Massachusetts) ignored the broad language of 1942's Wickard v. Filburn. That the Court eventually went along with a narrowing of Wickard doesn't mean that a metric buttload of people weren't making broad proclamations that what they wanted the law to be was what the law was, even when precedent wasn't on their side.

Every legal advocacy group does it, and it's not a bad thing, it's how the law gets moved. 




 Sometimes the Supreme Court changes its mind, and it doesn't do so unless there is a case before them where at the District Court and Circuit Court of Appeals levels, lawyers argued that what is legal differed from that the Supreme Court previously said was legal. In fact, since the Court rarely takes appeals where there isn't a circuit split, with some Circuit Courts of Appeals going one way and others going the other, it usually involves many lawyers in many courts challenging what the Supreme Court has previously ruled.

An ACLU lawyer might have a broader view of rights, a prosecutor might have a narrower view of rights, and on any given day, either one may be right. 




 Law can be hard. If it was easy, there wouldn't be smart, hardworking lawyers on both sides of an issue arguing before a learned district court judge, appointed by the President and confirmed by Congress, who might decide a question of law one way, be reversed 6-5 by the Circuit Court of Appeals, and then be reversed back 5-4 by the Supreme Court.

Moreover, the law can change. What you know to be the law today might not be the law tomorrow. Administrative law is a good example of how the Supreme Court can be a bit wobbly on issues. Read (if you dare) about Chevron, Auer, Skidmore, Chirstensen v. Harris County, and the latest decision, Decker v. Northwest Environmental Defense Center, and how questions of deference versus respect have moved back and forth. Each decision (well, not Decker, that maintained the status quo more or less) overnight changed the way admin law was practiced. Hell, Justice Scalia wrote the majority opinion in Auer for a unanimous Court in 1997 and a few months ago, wrote a scathing attack on the reasoning of Auer, writing "Our cases have not put forward a persuasive justification for Auer deference," etc., making no mention of the fact that HE WROTE THE BLOODY DECISION! Sorry. Back now. 




 The case law on online student speech is incredibly muddled. In 2010, two en banc panels of the Third Circuit each heard a case involving students creating a spoof MySpace account of their principal with rather similar facts involved, and on the same day, the two panels handed down decisions with opposite conclusions of law. (It was Layshock v. Hermitage Sch. Dist. and J.S. ex. rel. Snyder v. Blue Mountain Sch. Dist.) It was cleared up a year or so later though a rehearing, but it goes to show how unsettled this area of law is.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that speech aimed at a school or its personnel that is brought onto the school campus will be treated as in-school speech. (J.S. ex. rel. H.S. v. Bethlehem Area Sch. Dist.)

The Second Circuit, in two cases, applied a very broad view of school regulation of students' online speech. The Second Circuit's view is that speech likely to come to the attention of the school and cause a material or substantial disruption can be punished, seemingly without anything in the way of a limiting principle. (Wisniewski v. Bd. of Ed. and Doniger v. Niehoff.)

Since it's late and I need to sleep, I'll stop here and just sum up by saying administrators can pretty much do what they want right now. So long as they don't overstep the regulation and punishment that would be permitted for in-school speech, the law is unsettled to the point that being deemed to have qualified immunity is fairly certain should a suit arise. It would be very hard to hold them personally liable for violating a student's online free speech rights. 




 How long do you have before your paper is due? If you have a bit of time, you may want to try getting in touch with the Department of Justice itself and ask if an attorney would be willing to give you their view of the CFAA. (Hint: it's broad. One of their computer crimes attorneys told me a few years ago that he believed using an open wifi without permission may be a CFAA violation, analogizing to walking into a neighbor's home just because the door was left unlocked or open. And please, no downvotes for that, it's not MY view, I vehemently argued against this interpretation.) 




 Goss seems more relevant than morse. One is entitled to due process before suspension or expulsion, but the due process required is quite minimal.

The granddaddy of student rights cases was Tinker v. Des Moines, standing for the principal that student rights don't end at the schoolhouse gate and that wearing black arm bands in protest of the Vietnam War was protected symbolic speech so long as it does not result in a substantial/material disruption of the school environment.

Since others have brought up the free speech cases, I'll quickly run through the holdings, but I don't think believe they relate to the OP's question. Bethel excluded sexually explicit speech from protection in the schoolhouse context (one could phrase it as the Court deciding sexually explicit speech is inherently disruptive), Hazelwood was about speech in the context of school-controlled forums such as a school newspaper, school events, other publications, etc., and Morse was the court carving a special exception out to allow schools to engage in limited viewpoint discrimination when it comes to speech seen as promoting illicit drug use.

The better cases are Goss, TLO v. NJ, etc. 




 It's been codifiedthe First Amendment. It seems that you are asking for what it will take to codify it further?

You seem to be using precedent and codification interchangeably, and the two are not synonymous. Precedents are case law, they're judicial interpretations of statutes and the constitution. Codification is statutes, the Constitution, etc. (I say this not to be a dick or be pedantic, but because I'm not really sure what you are looking for.)

What would it take to further clarify the First Amendment? An additional amendment, which requires a 2/3rd vote in the House and Senate and ratification by 3/4ths of states, or 2/3rds of states to demand a Constitutional Convention, Congress to set the agenda of the Convention (although whether Congress can limit the agenda is disputed by various scholars), the Convention to propose amendments, and 3/4ths of states to ratify them. 




 As an American lawyer, I can't help you much. I know next to nothing about Canadian law, but the best argument I can see for a standard labor law is easing the regulatory burden of businesses. A national company spread across Canada may find itself subject to a range of labor laws, some of which may be conflicting and which may inhibit growth, cost money in software and HR, etc. Federal preemption can ease these burdens. (The counterargument is that preemption can be anti-democratic, because in the US, at least, states are often more responsive to citizen pressure and initiatives than the federal government, and allowing federal preemption in an area reduces the target of special interests to one political arena, whereas otherwise, they'd have to split their time and resources among the provincial governments.) 




 Ultra vires? Really? Grade 12? :P 




 Wow. Compared to other ex-Presidents this long after their presidency, Clinton looks remarkably young and healthy. His diet and exercise regimen have worked wonders. 




 I have no idea what the research methods or accuracy of the methods are, but this does not seem like a positive commentary on the public's view of the judiciary. 









 In some jurisdictions, yes, and that's certainly the common-law definition. In many jurisdictions however, by statute, the definition of criminal assault encompasses battery.

In Maryland, for example, assault, battery or a combination of the two is charged as assault. There is no longer a separate criminal charge for battery. 




 No need to "guess". Any intentional unwanted physical contact with another person is assault. 




 An administrative law essay question (55 minutes of the 4 hour exam) was based on NASCAR. 




 Have you stayed in touch with any of your past patients (or have they stayed in touch with you by sending the occasional thank you note or Christmas letter-sort of update)? 




 For federal law enforcement officers under the Executive Branch (which includes the Secret Service, FBI, US Marshals, US Park Police, Park Rangers, Pentagon Police, Federal Protective Service officers, DEA agents, ATF agents, etc.), 5 C.F.R. Part 2635 applies. It's not a police-specific statute, it applies to all employees of the Executive Branch. Gifts can be accepted under certain circumstances, and it may well not have applied to what OP described had a federal agent been involved instead of the local cop, but on the other hand, US Office of Govt. Ethics says, "Even if a gift is from a person or organization that has no official dealings with the employees agency, accepting a gift offered because of the employees official position may create an appearance of using public office for private gain." Changing the hypothetical from cop asking for free admission to cop getting free admission by flashing badge still creates an appearance of use of public position for private gain.

On the state law side, many jurisdiction's ethics rules are aimed towards preventing corruption in govt. contracting or in legislating, but some of the state laws in this matrix can apply to police officers: http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/ethicshome/50-state-table-gift-laws.aspx 




 It isn't always perfectly legal. Depends on the jurisdiction. Moreover, there's a big difference between accepting a gift and using your position of public authority and public trust to *ask* for a gift. 




 Wow. That's very unethical and in many places, criminal. If this happens again, you may want to ask your manager if he wants to contact internal affairs. 




 Yikes. One more instance of someone violently attacking a retail worker and not getting the cops called. :/ Perhaps pressure should be brought to bear on large corporations to treat physical abuse the way they do shoplifters? 




 Unfortunately, I can't a streaming version of it, but if you like this song, the Pyrates Royale, a Maryland pirate/nautical-themed band, do a cover that I think is better than the original. It's on their latest album "Keep Calm and Seek Revenge." http://www.pyrates.com/recordings/ 




 In 2010, a Lebanese army sniper shot and killed an IDF Lt. Colonel and wounded another IDF soldier as an IDF team tried to cut a tree on Israel's side of the border. The UN Interim Force was informed of this work beforehand, and confirmed that the IDF soldiers did not cross the border and that Lebanon had no cause to fire on the soldiers.

Nevertheless, Egypt, Iran, Morocco, Jordan, and Syria all blamed Israel for the incident. 




 Britain and France told the US about it first. Israel was the third country to claim there were chemical weapons used in Syria, but given the anti-Israel conspiracy nuts, this has been lost on many.

 Federal law? Federal law does not set alcohol prices. 




 *nods* Certainly seems questionable. If the worker has a medical condition leading to the flatulence, it should lead to an interactive dialogue between the employee and the SSA, not a reprimand. 




 I'm genuinely not sure if the flatulence disgusts you or the attempt to write him up for it disgusts you. 




 Guess it wasn't as bad as the Social Security Administration's employee whose chronic flatulence made national news when they tried writing him up for it: http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/fed-agency-retracts-official-reprimand-flatulence-article-1.1238760 




 That's...not true. The articles you linked to say that based on his stature as a hero, trying Rommel before the People's Court would have been very damaging to the military's morale. To avoid damaging morale, Hitler gave Rommel the option of suicide in exchange for his family's suicide, and gave the honorary funeral, official cause of death wartime injuries, etc. to maintain the fiction.

It had nothing to do with Hitler liking him as a general. 









 "Getting to Yes" by Roger Fisher and William Ury is one of the classics... I'd start there.

For a more anecdotal book, with less of an overarching method, I like Herb Cohen's "You Can Negotiate Anything: The World's Best Negotiator Tells You How To Get What You Want."

 How? 




 If the weather is nice next weekend, go to the Cherry Blossom festival. One of my favorite local performers, Margot Macdonald, is performing on Sunday the 7th. Oh, and the parade is on the 13th and the food afterwards is really good. 




 Back in the late '80s or early '90s, I remember my parents having to return 2 or 3 defective microwaves they just purchased. In frustration, they took a bag of potatoes to the store (I think it was Sears?), exchanged the defective microwave, and tested the replacement right then and there in the store. I think we still went through several more before getting a working model. 




 Who knows-it's possible they might never. But if they do and you didn't disclose it, you are well and truly screwed. Disclosing fully is the best policy (and the ethically appropriate one).  




 The Maryland Bar requires disclosing suspensions and expulsions going back to middle school, which was irksome because I received 1 day of "in-house suspension" for fighting in 6th grade and had to disclose it. (Before school started, while all the teachers were on the 2nd floor in a staff meeting, I was randomly attacked from behind by a kid with issues who started choking me. I defended myself, we wrestled, and someone went and got a teacher who broke it up. Even though the kid, to his credit I suppose, admitted he randomly attacked me, because we both fought, we both got 1 day of inhouse suspension.)

In my mandatory meeting with a member of the character and fitness committee (not because of my disclosure-everyone meets with a member of the committee), she said the committee laughed about this incident.

While your fake ID incident is not likely to amuse (or thrill) law school admission committees, I don't think they are likely to penalize you for it, either. 




 You. I like you. 




 (Note that I do NOT suggest actually attempting this.) 




 The definition of an electronic signature under the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act passed in most states is even more fun! "Electronic signature" means an electronic sound, symbol, or process attached to or logically associated with a record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record." (quoting Maryland's version of the Act) If affixed to a record with the intent to sign the record, one could theoretically have a clip from a Britney Spears song be their signature. 




 This was actually the subject of a lawsuit. http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/03/butt-head-astronomer.html 




 I'm a big fan of Elaine Corn's "Now You're Cooking: Everything a Beginner Needs to Know to Start Cooking Today." http://www.amazon.com/Now-Youre-Cooking-Everything-Beginner/dp/1883791057/ Very clear descriptions of common recipe terms, clear recipes, it's a wonderful starter book. 



















 Why would the process suffer merely by being more broadly observed? 




 Audio and transcripts aren't the same as video. The law isn't a popularity contest, but we do gain by letting the public view the process-transparency begets legitimacy. It could move us beyond thinking of the Court as a 5-4 binary block and highlight the cases when Ginsburg and Scalia are both dissenting, or when the Court is unanimous.

Members of the Court claim that video would lead to 5 second soundbytes, as if Court coverage is not already 5 second soundbytes-they're just being read by anchors instead of the real thing. Video would at least give the possibility of more people getting the full story through a CSPAN-type channel. 




 This isn't a new thing, it's common practice for important oral arguments as the NYT article reports, and it's common for Congressional hearings too.

Live broadcasting oral arguments on TV wouldn't completely eliminate folks being paid to stand in line, but it would help ensure that a full understanding of the workings of one of the three branches of government isn't limited to those who can afford to spend $50 an hour starting four days prior to arguments.

 When they're the party in a suit, such as a criminal case, family law case, etc., it's not quite so easy to dismiss their filings. 




 That's a question best suited for your lawyer, since debt collection is not my area of expertise. As I recall, (keeping in mind that I can't give you legal advice, I'm not your lawyer, and it's past my bedtime so my memory may be a little foggy), there may be a difference between what an agent of the company can do versus a debt collector. First party collections is generally not covered by the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act. I don't recall off the top of my head if this is a request that needs to be in writing or not. 




 If threatening to turn you in to the feds is threatening you with federal law enforcement, be smart and lawyer up. That's treading dangerously close to extortion if not over the line. 




 *grins* To be fair, we almost never know when a case is coming down. ;) Suspect, maybe, but unless it's the last day of the term.... 




 Gotcha. In that case, we're in complete agreement. :-) 




 I really mean no disrespect when I say this (as opposed to people saying no disrespect when they really mean that they don't care that they're being disrespectful), but I wonder if you and the SPLC are both overstating your respective cases. It does seem overblown to suggest that the issues of courts and the participants being swamped is a result of sovereign citizens and not chronic underfunding and a lack of staff. On the other hand, I think you may be understanding the amount of resources that sovereign citizens drain compared to a more "normal" or rational case. 

To put it in tl;dr terms, The prolong, dragged out nature of these cases is a significant burden on the system, more than just being merely annoying and rarely violent, so I disagree with you there, but I think the system would be pretty well and truly borked regardless of sovereign citizen issues, so, I disagree with the SPLC too. 




 For those paying attention, the white nationalist side of the sovereign citizen movement has been reasonably well documented by the media, but the press has not gotten into the Moorish off-shoots very much. (Although the Southern Poverty Law Center has certainly taken note of the many African-Americans involved with the movement. see http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/ideology/sovereign-citizens-movement )

I thought law.reddit.com might be interested in the Post's treatment of the Moorish sovereign citizen movement. 









 This sort of activity is one reason even in cases with DNA evidence, there is a risk of wrongful conviction. In the midst of the death penalty repeal debate in Maryland, some state senators argued that the tightening of MD's death penalty statute a few years ago that limited death penalty eligibility to cases involving a videotaped confession, evidence on videotape, or DNA evidence was sufficient to avoid wrongful convictions. (One state senator even loudly proclaimed he was tired of hearing the other side of the issue utter the name Kirk Bloodsworth, a Maryland man freed from death death row who was in attendance at the hearing, because they tightened the statute to prevent that sort of scenario.)

DNA doesn't speak for itself, however, It's interpreted evidence, interpreted by science, potentially manipulated accidentally or purposefully, and at risk of having a forensic person lie about the result. 




 I'm glad you stood strong! 




 Yikes. Sorry you went through that. 

What did the 8 group leaders want to ask you or tell you? 




 Sorry to hear about this. :( I do tend to suspect it might be a matter of sequestration, as callmehondo said below. It definitely sucks and is unfair, but there's also not much in the way of potential remedies for it... 

My only suggestion is to contact some alums in the private sector (if there is a private sector counterpart to what the job would have been), say what happened, and ask if they know anyone who might be able help you find an equivalent internship. (You'd probably have to go unpaid instead of paid, but better than nothing...) Given that you so obviously got screwed, alums of your school may be more inclined to help you than the average person who shoots them an e-mail. 




 Some pay, some don't. Pathways program, for example, are all paid. 




 Testing people's security by walking up to their houses and jiggling the door handle will probably get you in legal trouble. Going inside houses, taking an item from each, and giving your spoils to the press to publicize the issue will definitely get you in legal trouble. 




 An interesting mix in the decision making: Breyer wrote the majority, joined by Roberts, Thomas, Alito, Sotomayor, and Kagan. Kagan wrote an concurring opinion joined by Alito. Ginsburg wrote a dissent joined by Kennedy, and joined by Scalia except to parts III and V-B-1.

 I'm distressed by the number of stories in this subreddit that involve things being thrown at employees. Do stores really not call the cops over this? It's assault, for goodness sakes. 




 You certainly won't have opportunity for street busking like you might in Boston or NYC. Playing for free on the Green? Sure. Having folks toss money in a hat? Not going to happen.

But yes, there are plenty of things to do. The Dartmouth Outing Club has many outdoorsy options beyond extreme sports, if you're interest in skiing, there's the Dartmouth Skiway, there's horseback riding at the Dartmouth Riding Center, there's pickup sports games, there's frisbee on the Green, there's the Hanover Country Club if you want to play golf, etc... All sorts of options.

There are sometimes open mic-type events at the Collis Center, and you may be able to arrange playing there as well. Not many places to play off campus because there isn't much "off campus" in general. There IS an acoustic music showcase at the Canoe Club, a restaurant a block from the Green. I'm not sure if it's an open mic night or what-that particular event only started up last month and I'm long graduated, but you could give them a call or e-mail and ask. http://www.canoeclub.us

As far as not getting bored, the Hopkins Center for the Arts is pretty good at bring fascinating performers to campus, and student tickets are really cheap. I definitely miss getting front row tickets for artists like Itzhak Perlman or Bobby McFerrin for $5. (I think they're $10 now, but $10 to hear the likes of Yo-Yo Ma, who performed at Dartmouth this past September, seems like a bargain to me.) The Hopkins Center would also probably be the folks to contact to ask about jam sessions and the like-they should know... 




 Profiling is legal, so long as it isn't based on prohibited criteria, such as race, nationality, religion, etc. Having a pot leaf sticker or t-shirt isn't a protected classification.

Looking like a stoner doesn't give the officer a right to have a dog brought in-the officer already has a right to have dog brought in, and has the right to exercise discretion as to whether to bother or not. Making that decision because someone looks like a stoner, so long as the officer's definition of stoner isn't based on a suspect class like race, etc., perfectly okay. 




 Apparently, the government must intrude on individual rights to ensure the government doesn't intrude on individual rights. 


































 Syria, Iran, and Hezballah have threatened to attack Israel if the US strikes Syria.

Because of this, Israel tested its anti-missile defense system. How does one test an anti-missile defense system? With dummy missiles.

I don't see how it's warmongering to test one's defenses after being threatened with missile strikes, and if Syria wants to test its own missile defenses, it can go right ahead. 









 Ah, so at least it was an emergency. Still not exactly the best seamanship out there, but it wasn't as though the officer was speeding to meet someone for lunch. 




 I'm no boating person, but that sure looks like negligence to me. Anyone know what the police were responding to?

 I disagree with those saying to not read/study/learn anything before 1L. I'm not saying you need to (or should) pay money for a system or software (I've never heard of LearnLeo), but if you have the time before school starts, pick up one supplement for each of the core law school classes. 

For Civ Pro, the Glannon Examples and Explanations book is king. For contracts, I liked the Understanding Contracts book from Lexis, but there's no one must-have book like Civ Pro. Do the same for Torts, Con Law, and Property. I wouldn't worry so much about Crim Law because I found Crim Law to vary the most from professor to professor. If you have the time, sure, pick up a book and do the same, but it's at the bottom of the priority listing.

Skim them. No need to brief anything, no need to memorize anything, and no need to master anything. What you should get out of this is a mental catalogue of where elements of the subject fit, so when you read a case, you have a sense of where it fits into the overarching jurisprudential firmament. 




 No, no it does not. The true owner cannot be dispossessed of a right to his/her property, no matter how many times something has changed hands after the theft and no matter whether the people involved knew it was stolen or not. The bona fide purchaser doctrine does not apply to stolen goods.

Leaving real estate out of it, property follows the Irving Principle. There was a 1965 comedy album called "You Don't Have to Be Jewish" that contained a popular song, "The Ballad of Irving," sung by Frank Gallop. The Ballad of Irving was about the 142nd fastest gunslinger in the West. One of the verses began, "141 could draw faster than he, but Irving was looking for 143." That is the Irving Principle. It doesn't matter if 141 can draw faster than you if you're facing 143. Well, in property, it does not matter of 141 people have a better claim to a piece of property than you do, so long as you are up against #143. 

Here's a practical example of the Irving Principle at work. Albert buys a bike. Bob steals the bike and sells it to Cathy, who doesn't know it was stolen. Cathy later sells it to Dwight. Edgar steals the bike from Dwight and sells it to Frank. Who can legitimately claim the bike? It depends on who is making the claim. Dwight can come along get the bike back from Frank because it was stolen from him. Frank has no right to the bike, he has no right to compensation from Dwight for the bike, Frank's only remedy is to try getting his money back from Edgar. This is true, even thought at any point in time, Albert can stumble upon the location of his bike and file suit to get his bike back. Dwight has a better claim than Frank, Albert has a better claim than anyone, but in a fight between Dwight and Frank, Dwight wins. The Irving Principle.

All of which is a roundabout way of saying that bona fide purchasing has nothing to do with stolen property. 




 Of course The Chubby Checker app is a vulgar pun. Of course it violates the trademark of the singer Chubby Checker.

The only element of this story that is potentially newsworthy is that HP might be held liable for trademark infringement over hosting an app that they didn't actually name or create themselves. 




 I'd add Yamas in Bethesda to the list, certainly. 




 I'm a fan of the Lawyer2Lawyer podcast. Some really interesting interviews, and their guests give their contact info at the end if you want to followup on a topic. :-) http://legaltalknetwork.com/podcasts/lawyer-2-lawyer/ 




 There are dessert trucks, including a pie truck, but their location depends on the day. Sometimes at L'Enfant Plaza, I can get a slice of pie, a cupcake, or a cookie, and some days, there's not a single dessert truck there.

If you'll be doing this during the lunch hour, L'Enfant Plaza is the best place to get government workers. 




 If you're under 25 and might need to rent cars, ABA membership may get you out of paying a surcharge. Otherwise, the $60 is not worthwhile. 




 Depending on the state, there may be lawyers who specialize in getting other lawyers through the character and fitness process. (In Florida, for example, I'd send you to Brian Tannenbaum.) This is serious, and if you can find experienced counsel who deals with C F issues in your state, I urge you to use them. 




 I hope your interview went well, OP.

I saw this too late to be helpful to you, but for others who may stumble across this looking for advice in the future, I'd like to echo BlackLetterLaw's suggestion that one should research the firm and its attorneys. Try to find connections. Did anyone go to your law school or undergrad? Same clubs or interests? Did anyone publish articles or books you can skim? Were any of the attorneys you might meet involved in any landmark cases, Supreme Court cases, etc.? (One of the attorneys I interviewed with at one point was really impressed I asked him about his experience arguing before the Supreme Court. Apparently, I was the first person he interviewed who ever asked him about it. I didn't get the job, but it was clearly a point in my favor that I asked about it.)

You might be asked what book have you read recently, or what's your favorite book, etc. Have an answer. Lots of firms want people with intellectual curiosity.

Lots of law school's career services offer mock interviews. It's worthwhile. If they don't offer it, ask a professor if she or he would be willing to do a mock interview with you. Or a friend. It gives you the chance to develop answers and practice being put on the spot. BUT-don't practice so much that you are going off a completed script. Interviews are supposed to be a conversation. 




 Gee, I hope all our suspects are this much fun. 




 Other members of the Court may not engage in the sort of behavior the Act is intended to bar, but I don't think they would sanction Congress meddling with the internals workings of the Court. 




 Others have given you great advice (only need casebooks in class, use E Es for outlines, no need for bar chart stuff, etc.), but I'd also note that I highly, highly urge you to skim through the E Es now, in the next couple of weeks before class starts. I emphasize SKIM as opposed to study or read, just to know where to mentally categorize and place what you'll be learning during the semester. Do it now, while you have the time. 




 The Constitutionality of this is questionable. While Congress has the power to pass legislation that increases or decreases the size of the Court, and the power to pass laws that are precluded from judicial review, etc., something that affects the internal workings of the Court itself raises a separation of powers argument. Who would give the final word on whether it is Constitutional? *coughs* The Supreme Court. 




 I just took a cab via Uber from AU to home. There aren't many cabs that go past AU's law school, so street hailing is out. I can either call a DC cab company with absolutely no idea how long it will take to get a cab (sometimes a cab comes in 10 minutes, sometimes it's 30, or I can use Uber, pay $2 more, and know exactly how long it will take for the cab to arrive and where the cab is as it's coming.

 Right to work states don't mean that you aren't an at-will-employee or otherwise have any greater protection against being fired, it means it is harder for unionization. It's a pro-employer policy. 




 No, that's not exactly what Justice Kennedy is saying.

There are two types of standing. One is Article III standing and the other is prudential standing.

Article III standing comes from the Constitution, namely, Article III, and requires courts only get involved with an actual case or controversy. Unlike other countries, the US courts don't issue advisory opinions. (There's a whole list of things that go into whether there is an actual case or controversy that I won't go into here.)

Prudential standing requirements can be discarded by the courts whenever they find cause. They are self-imposed requirements, they are not Constitutionally mandated, so they can also be ignored at whim. 

Justice Kennedy is not saying the Supreme Court can ignore Article III standing or ignore jurisdiction. If there's no Article III standing, the Court can't hear the case. Same for jurisdiction. What he is saying is that just as a dieter can choose to make exceptions, be it an exception for one's birthday or for a particularly tasty-looking treat, the Court can decide to make exception to rules it imposes on itself. 




 This isn't a legal question, it's a factual question. Regrettably, without the tags, I'd wager the odds of police catching the person are nil. 




 Um, get a lawyer. Now. Not a reddit-appointed lawyer, an actual, licensed-in-California, criminal defense attorney.  




 Give Georgetown Bagelry (in Bethesda) a try. http://georgetownbagelry.com 




 Oy. My advice is for goodness sakes, get yourself a lawyer. Petty theft is a crime. Crimes are bad, and not the sort of thing you want on your record. If you are convicted or plead guilty, yes, it's may well be on your record permanently. Find a good lawyer in your jurisdiction. 




 The TL;DR is document review jobs are certainly better than having no job, or a lot of various minimum wage jobs, but they are the sweatshop of the legal world. See it as a temporary means of sustenance, not a long-term plan. 




 There is no possibility of advancement and there is no loyalty. Document review attorneys are expendable. You might get hired for a project only to be told the night before that they overhired, and "Oops, sorry, [click]." 

And while I can 't speak to the accuracy of all of what areyouinsane said in the link by anti09, he's definitely right that you generally find out the project is over by telephone. In my last doc review project before going back to school for my LL.M. and getting hired in a real job (now finishing up LL.M. part-time), as documents were running out, we'd go in for what was supposed to be a full day of work, go through all the documents in about 2 hours, and then be sent home (with no added pay, obviously, other than the 2 hours were worked) and told to call a recording to see if there were more documents. There were, but we were told to call every day. So there were 2 days of full work, another day told to go home after a few hours, a day of full work, and the next morning, the machine said the project was over and we should mail our badges for the building back. (At our expense, natch.) 




 (Oh, and if you have any specific questions, PM me.) :-) 




 One: Figure out how you're going to get to school. There's no parking for 1Ls in the garage underneath WCL, and if you park in the neighborhood around WCL, you will almost certainly get a $75 ticket from the school. If you need/want to drive to school, you have to park on main campus (paying the bucks for a parking pass) and take the free shuttle to school. Doable, but annoying. The free shuttles also go to the Tenleytown metro, so, that's a strong option.

Two: Some people take law school way too seriously. If you have no free time to spend with a significant other, never go out with friends, spend all your time in the library writing an outline the size of War and Peace, etc., you're trying too hard.

Three: Some people don't take law school seriously enough. If you're out at the bars every night and aren't doing the reading, etc., you're not trying hard enough. Grades do matter, especially in the less than great legal market.

Four: This doesn't apply to 1Ls, since you don't get choices, but when you get to pick classes your 2L and 3L years, DON'T pick classes based on the bar. What you need to know for the bar, you'll pick up in bar prep courses. 

DO pick classes based on professors. Professors make or break classes. Doesn't matter how exciting or dull a subject is. A good professor will make it amazing, a bad professor will make you wish you decided to become a sanitation worker instead of going to law school.

I suggest you take Evidence, because it's so fundamental to what lawyers do. Similarly, I strongly urge you to take Administrative Law. It touches upon almost every other area of law, so, it's really important to know. If you can, take Professor Popper's class. His exam is long but fair, and he is a wonderful professor.

Five: Do a clinic. Practical experience is vital, and it gives you the chance to learn and make mistakes in a safe environment with experienced practitioners guiding you and protecting you from harming your client or yourself.

Six: Network, network, network. Your internships and externships, be it during the summer or during the academic terms, are vital for getting jobs after graduation. Networking will help you get good internships and externships, and they'll help you get jobs.

Seven: Don't bother getting involved with the SBA. It's the equivalent of a high school student council but with even less real impact on the school and with more threats of lawsuits over silly things that don't matter a damn.

Eight: Do try for law review, and you don't get chosen for the main law review, join one of the briefs.

Nine: Go to office hours. Make sure professors know you and you know them, so when you need help getting an internship or job, etc., professors will a: have nice things to say about you, and b: want to help you.

 I agree that the use of the FISA court has been appalling, however, I don't see how a President can be impeached for using a law the way it was designed to be used, going through a judicial review process (as weak as the FISA process is), and keeping Congress properly informed. This wasn't Bush's NSA scandal, where the NSA went after the content of domestic calls without even going through the motions of a warrant from the FISA court. This was for the phone records, not content, which involve a lesser expectation of privacy and all branches of government were involved. Unconstitutional? Yes, personally, I think it is. Awful? Yes, personally, I think it is. 

A high crime or misdemeanor meriting impeachment of the President? If it is, you'd also need to impeach the judges who heard the FISA cases and expel the members of Congress who authorized it (given that the PATRIOT Act was passed nearly unanimously, somehow I doubt that will happen).

This was not unilateral action akin to other Presidential scandals, such as Watergate, Iran-Contra, etc. 




 If flights can't be obtained, it might be worth figuring out the cost of a town car service. It's pricey, but more reliable. For something this important, reliability is key. 




 Really? Who else besides Dartmouth plays pong with paddles? 




 Russ Feingold is now a former politician, but given that he was the only person with both the courage and intelligence to vote against the PATRIOT Act in the first place, he deserves a huge amount of respect. 




 It's a matter of personal preference. The tradeoff is probably screensize versus weight. 

You're going to be lugging your laptop everywhere. How much are you willing to schlep, on top of casebooks that outweigh many dictionaries?

When you write papers, are you going to want the space to have a Lexis or Westlaw window next to your word processing window or are you okay flipping back and forth between the two? Hard to do the side-by-side thing on a 13" laptop, at least without squinting. That's why I prefer the 17". On the other hand, it's heavier than I'd likenow that I'm commuting from work to night classes for the LL.M., I must confess I find myself using an iPad and an external keyboard for notetaking more often than not because it's easier to carry.

SSD is entirely unimportant if you're just using it for law school related work. You don't need to spend that much cash on boosting the speed of saving OneNote or Word files.

I don't think the issue is necessarily one of keyboard quality, so much as it's keyboard comfort. The quality is pretty much universal assuming you're not buying a laptop that's supposedly a mainstream US laptop but is coming in a battered box that suspiciously only has Asian lettering on it and you found it for $150 from a guy on Canal Street. Comfort is a personal choice. What size keys, what layout, how much give the keys have, etc., all can differ from manufacturer to manufacturer (if not laptop to laptop). I urge you to go try them out in the Apple Store or Microsoft Store or Costco or (if you must) Best Buy (boo, hiss), instead of ordering one sight unseen. 




 Not sure why my responses have been downvoted, and perhaps this will meet the same fate, but an op-ed by Esther Lardent over at the National Law Journal touches upon the conflict of interest issue (albeit in an entirely different context), writing, "Particularly concerning is the notion of imputed disqualification, the ethical construct that if one lawyer in a large legal setting has a conflicts issue, all lawyers in that institution are presumed to share the same information and conflict." In a 50 state+ scenario, one lawyer with a conflicts issue can disqualify everyone. The more clients, the more potential conflicts. 




 This was a poor decision. From what I have read, it was not arbitrary or capricious to keep a 10-year-old off the adult lung transplant list because medically, it is less likely that an adult lung transplant would be successful. It would not necessarily fit or function. Instead of saving a 10 year old, you might have killed the adult who would have otherwise gotten the lungs. 




 Oh! It's my cake day! How did I miss that?! (Oh, right. 8.5 hours of work followed by 2.1 hours of school.) Thank you! :-) 




 The linked article itself says that he was not promoted to Admiral. 




 Preemption, preemption, preemption. It's a waste of time and money, with a 0% chance of surviving judicial review. 




 I like Professor Kerr, but I disagree with him that it is a love of Fourth Amendment balancing that moves Justice Breyer. I believe it's outcomes, a results-oriented jurisprudence that moves him in these cases.

A friend of mine had a 4th Amendment school case go to the Supreme Court in which she was the plaintiff. A few years later, she and I were both at a small meeting with Justice Breyer with the opportunity to talk to him, and she introduced herself and asked why he ruled against her. His answer was that he was worried about the dangers and prevalence of drugs in schools. That the decision was not congruous with precedent did not seem to matter, nor did he make a legal argument when asked the question. His was a simple outcome-oriented response. 




 I suppose I'm not surprised... Justice Scalia has often (albeit not to the level of "commonly") joined the "liberal" wing of the court in criminal procedure cases, and Justice Breyer's practical or outcome-oriented jurisprudence is often underestimated in media analyses. 




 Watch and learn as much as you can, and work as hard as you can so when you want a internship or recommendation as a law student, they happily give it to you. 




 Nobody is accusing him of committing a crime as far as I know. Ethical violations, yes. But the sanction for those is suspension or loss of a law license, not imprisonment. 




 (Heck, some states have nebulous rules about what firms can post online. The Florida Bar hotline claims that every tweet or Facebook post must include the name of the lawyer, firm, and office address.) 









 Lots of firms operate in multiple states. No firms operate in all 50. 

As I said, not all state ethical rules are congruous. Everything from the firm name to who can be on the letterhead, to what offices must be listed on the letterhead, to various duties, etc., all are governed by different rules depending on the state.

DLA Piper, the firm other has listed in this thread as one of the closest things to OP's question, has offices in New York, Georgia, Texas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Illinois, California, Florida, Minnesota, New Jersey, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Arizona, North Carolina, Washington, Delaware, and DC. A lot of jurisdictions to juggle, but that's 17 jurisdictions. Not 50 states plus DC. 




 It would be an ethical impossibility. Remember, every state has its own ethical rules and every state's ethical rules are difference. One cannot comply with all of them.

Worse, think of the conflicts of interest. Screening for conflicts on a scale that large is impractical, and every matter a firm takes on limits matters it can handle in other contexts. 

The tl;dr is that this wouldn't be a path to riches, it's a pathway to loss of licenses. 




 Heh. It takes about 45 minutes each way by bus/metro for me to get to work every day, so, I have some time to read. :P 




 Thanks for the suggestion. I read both of their books over the past few days. I enjoyed Evans book as a companion to Lipstadt's, but I'm glad I read her's first. I don't think Evans does a great job setting the scene and providing context, but with the background and details I had from reading Lipstadt's book, Evans did a great job filling in his part of the story.

Guttenplan's was an interesting read for an outside observer's view of the trial. He seemed self-contradictory in a few places if not obtuse, but still worth a read. 




 If you want something non-fiction, legal, but light (in terms of the intended audience, not in tone), go for Mark Curriden and Leroy Phillips's "Contempt of Court: The Turn-of-the-Century Lynching That Launched a Hundred Years of Federalism." It's written for the lay audience, so, it meets the light category.

In 1906, Ed Johnson, a black man, was accused of raping a white woman. He was tried and convicted by an all-white jury. Two local attorneys appealed his case to Justice Harlan, the circuit judge for the Sixth Circuit, who agreed to have the Supreme Court hear the case. After the Court issued a stay-of-execution, Johnson was lynched.

The Court was outraged, perhaps more at the mob thwarting its order than at the loss of life itself, and the Court accused those it deemed responsible of contempt of Court in the case US v. Shipp. This was the only criminal trial the Supreme Court has ever held, with Sheriff Joseph F. Shipp, his chief jailer, and some members of the lynch mob as defendants.

It's well written, an easy read on an interesting subject, and I think that if you aren't over-lawed from bar studying, it's a good choice. 




 Er, at this point, wouldn't it have been more accurate to describe them as shoplifters and not customers?

 First, that's an entirely different question from your original premise.

Second, did you listen to his speech, in person or through the live stream? I did. He didn't deliver anything other the standard law school graduation speech. Not a question of fault, not calling him a bad speaker, but it's the sort of thing nearly everyone delivers. He didn't deliver any unique insights. 




 Bull feathers. The role of a government lawyer is to use his or her professional judgment. The current rumor is that President Obama will be picking James B. Comey as his nominee to head the FBI. Comey was the Deputy Attorney General in the GWB administration from Dec. '03-Aug '05, and during that time, he famously refused to sign off on extending the NSA's illegal warrantless spying.

Here is what Comey had to say on this subject: "The lawyer is the custodian of so much. The custodian of our own personal reputations, surely. But more importantly, the custodian of our institutional reputations. And most importantly of all,the custodian of our constitution and the rule of law.It is the job of a good lawyer to say 'yes.' It is as much the job of a good lawyer to say 'no.' 'No' is much, much harder. 'No' must be spoken into a storm of crisis, with loud voices all around, with lives hanging in the balance. 'No' is often the undoing of a career.And often, 'no' must be spoken in competition with the voices of other lawyers who do not have the courage to echo it. For all those reasons, it takes far more than a sharp legal mind to say 'no' when it matters most. It takes moral character."

 Or maybe midgets. 




 That's an unfair way of phrasing the question. Prominent people from both sides of the aisle speak at WCL all the time. Liberals go to hear speakers from the Federalist Society or from the ACLJ. Conservatives go to hear from the Legal Defense Fund or the ACLU. But there's a big difference between speaking at a school and speaking at a school's graduation.

Had Koh spoken on campus (not during graduation), there would have been massive attendance, some pointed questions during the Q A session, and a worthwhile exchange of ideas.

Graduation speeches are a 1-way communication and they are not a place to give a platform for controversy. The focus should be on the graduates. 

For the record, regardless of my beliefs as to the legality of the drone program, I don't find Koh objectionable. I don't think his reading of the law is over the line, the way the Bush Office of Legal Counsel was with the torture memos. My quibble is with EthanB00's claim that WCL students don't want to hear from those they disagree with. 




 Good grief. I suspect he's the type most likely to fail. Burnout and all that.

No matter what bar prep course you take, how many old exams you look at, or how many hours you spend, odds are high you'll come across a question you didn't study for. Maybe they haven't tested secured transactions in 11 years and it's your lucky day, they decided to bring it back. Maybe it's a hybrid question that's confusing you. Whatever it is, you still need to be able to look at it, think like a lawyer, and even if you have to make up the law, write a cogent, lawyerly analysis. Partial credit goes a long way. If you're fried from going into hermitage to study exclusively, you're not going to be in any condition to analyze anything new.

The bar exam is hard, but it's not THAT hard. And it's pass/fail. Every point you get above passing is a point you should have spent in the sun. 




 If they are changing you to a position that offers lower pay, do you need to give them 2 weeks notice? What exactly was in that contract you signed? 




 OK, thanks for the kind correction. :-) 




 Excellent! I requested it from my local library, so, it should hopefully be in my hands within the next few days. 




 I don't mean to be disrespectful, and I'm certainly no expert in British law, but my understanding is that the burden of proof in British libel cases is on the defendant. This means defendants have show that what they said was the truth (or some other defense).

Plaintiffs have the burden of establishing the appropriate compensatory damages, but the burden of proof is not on the plaintiff to show that the alleged defamatory words were false, but rather, on the defendant to show that they were true or another defense applies. Getting punitive damages is harder than compensatory damage. Punitive damages require demonstrating actual malice.

Again, I'm no expert on British law. This is my understanding from what I've read, and if I'm wrong, I welcome correction. 




 Ooh-thanks! I wasn't aware of those. I'm looking into getting them from the library now! 




 Then I don't understand your argument that there needs to be laws limiting lawyer compensation. It's a free market. Lawyers set their prices and clients decide whether or not to hire a particular lawyer.

In the current scenario, about the court-appointed trustees, sure, they are getting a great deal of money from the case, but they have also recovered a great deal of money for Madoff's victims. Could the court have found lawyers to do it for less? Absolutely. Would those lawyers have done as good or a better job? Not necessarily.  




 I agree with almost everything you've said except your third point about the Irving v. Lipstadt trial. David Irving was the plaintiff, not the defendant, which might go towards your claim that libel is a hard claim to win, but the trial occurred in Great Britain where libel cases are much easier to win.

Dooperdoo's post was rather misleading when he said that Irving ran afoul of Lipstadt. Lipstadt made a few minor references to him, and Irving picked the fight. He chose to sue. It would be more accurate to say that Lipstadt ran afoul of Irving. Irving got demolished in the courtroom. It became clear that the sting of Lipstadt's words about him were absolutely true. Given how badly Irving looked during and after the trial, some felt sympathy for him and blamed Lipstadt for the decimation of Irving's reputation. This, of course, ignores or forgets that it was Irving who sued Lipstadt, attacking her reputation and livelihood as a scholar, not vice versa, and that Irving's lawsuit required Lipstadt prove Irving was a holocaust denier or at the least, an ally of deniers.

Lipstadt wrote a really worthwhile book on the subject, titled "History on Trial: My Day in Court with a Holocaust Denier." It's not every day one comes across a memoir about a court experience that turns out to be a page-turner. 




 I went to a college with a non-traditional schedule, allowing people to take off a Fall, Winter, or Spring term for internships and make it up with a full summer-term of classes. I interned for the Department of Justice for a Winter and got to do the sort of paralegal work that in the summer, they have law students do.

If you have any degree of flexibility at your school, try for something other than a summer, so you aren't up against all the law students.

Negot8or is right about the issues of unauthorized practice of law, but that's solvable if they put you to use in the paralegal type of role, with some discovery screening, drafting, basic research, etc. 




 I can't imagine a LL.M. would give a damn about your LSAT score. LSAT programs allegedly have some sort of correlation with 1L grades, which is why law schools use the test. Now that you actually have law school grades, I'd think the LSAT would be meaningless for LL.M. admission.

As a J.D. grad of the school I'm going to for my LL.M., I believe I had an abridged application process, and if they wanted my LSAT score, it would already be in their files, but there was no mention of the score in the application process I went through. 




 I had an unpaid summer clerkship with the US Marshals Service's Office of General Counsel during the summer between being a 1L and 2L. They required a drug test. They also required an SF-85 which specifically asks about prior drug use.

 As others have said, tort reform has nothing to do with limiting lawyer compensation, it has to do with limiting the amount of money victims of bad behavior or mistakes can recover.

Doctors and some others think that this will reduce the amount of insurance they pay, but it doesn't work that way. In states that have implemented tort reform, insurance premiums continued to rise. Why? Because doctors' lawsuit exposure or not, insurance companies raise rates to make more money.

Tort reform is also desired by big corporations as a means of both limiting the amount of exposure they have to lawsuits and as a way to help budget in lawsuits as a cost of doing business. One of the purposes of punitive damages is to provide a significant deterrent to the defendant or others to engage in bad behavior. Capping punitive damages does away with the deterrence effect-it can now be factored in as a business expense, as a known, fixed externality. 




 What really pisses me off is all the people commenting on the initial reports by blaming Sarah McClay for alleging getting herself killed. People faulted her for going where she wasn't supposed to be, or being on a cellphone, etc., when it turns out, she was just doing her job the way she was told to do it. Not her fault.

I'm sure her friends and family were reading some of those articles and some of those comments, and it would have been cruel to write those comments even had they been true. But they weren't. 




 There's no such thing as a "social media riot" and there is nothing punishable about inspiring others to speak out. His "harassment" of the principal was protected speech unless it caused a substantial and material disruption at school. Lots of people speaking up on twitter isn't a disruption.

Using his cell phone in class is punishable. Punishing him for the content of his tweets is not okay unless there is important information missing from the press accounts. 




 Schools are NOT the equivalent of an employer-one chooses to work or not for an employer, whereas students are compelled to attend school. 




 The main case on student speech is still Tinker v. Des Moines, which beyond flowery words about rights of students not stopping at the schoolhouse gate also gives us the need to demonstrate that the prohibited or punished speech would materially and substantially interfere with school discipline/operation. While there's been some narrowing with Bethel, Kuhlmeier, and Morse, there hasn't been much added to Supreme Court jurisprudence that applies to student speech generally.

Circuit and district courts, dealing with online speech, have come up with a variety of tests to determine if it should be treated the same as in-school speech or given more protection (such as in the Third Circuit's rulings in Layshock v. Hermitage School District, and the final ruling in J.S. ex rel. Snyder v. Blue Mountain School District). Here, the facts are different because the tweets themselves were made from on-campus. I suspect that would lead a court to say that the tweets are on-campus speech, but even then, that only allows punishment if the disruption requirement of Tinker is met. I don't see any evidence of a disruption or potential for disruption. Instead, the school punished student speech it didn't like because it didn't like it, and that's a First Amendment violation and grounds for a 42 U.S.C. 1983 suit. 




 Here's a link to reddiquette. http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette I draw your attention to the last line that says "[Please don't c]omplain about cross posts. Just because you saw it in one place, doesn't mean everyone has seen it. Just vote and move on." 

Yeah. I missed your post in /r/news and I deleted my link after you called my attention to yours. Your complaint here is unwarranted. 




 If you have Amazon Prime, there are three seasons of Good Eats available. 




 Darn. Missed it. Sorry. 




 A school can certainly punish a student for using a cell-phone in class, but punishing him for the content of his tweets seems unconstitutional. The tweets listed in the article do not rise to the level of a substantial or material disruption of the schoolhouse environment. 

No disruption+pure speech=First Amendment protected speech (leaving aside discussion of exceptions for lewd speech, speech promoting illicit drug use, etc.).

Assuming that the punishment for using a cell phone to tweet in class would not have been 3 days suspension (without punishment for content of the tweets), said student would seem to have grounds to sue the school and the school officials involved in his suspension. I don't see grounds to claim qualified immunity on a case this basic.

 I'm perplexed. What is the distinction between quitting and resigning? 




 Some schools look at your highest score, others will average your LSAT scores. Might be worthwhile taking the time to get it right the first time. On the other hand, in case something goes horribly wrong at the test center, it's a good idea to not leave it to the last minutehaving an opportunity to do a redo if need be is best. 




 The footage from KFOR and News9 is scary... I hope the folks in Shawnee make it okay. 














 Well-named. They are adorable. 




 Yep. Preempted. Food labeling is within the purview of the FDA under the Food, Drugs, and Cosmetics Act and the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act. The NLEA explicitly preempts state labeling laws that are not identical to the requirements of the NLEA. 21 U.S.C.  343-1. Between the FDCA and the NLEA, there's a very strong argument that anything not explicitly preempted by the NLEA is still implicitly preempted by the federal statutes occupying the field. 














 Well, I'm glad you posted it. I hadn't seen this one before. 




 I loved my StarTac. Best thing about flip phones is the ability to hang up on people by slamming it shut. Try hanging up in anger on a smartphone and you're liable to break a finger! 




 You can't understand why someone who was traumatized by being drugged and gang-raped by colleagues, and treated as a criminal instead of a victim by police, might do whatever she was told to try to make the threats and harassment stop? Really? 




 I think the hardest 1L subject is Property, and no, not just because of the dreaded Rule Against Perpetuity. The other 1L courses offer a overarching, cohesive (or semi-cohesive) structure to study. Everything fits together pretty neatly in Torts, or Contracts, things are at the least interconnected in Con Law and obv. goes back to one document, Civ Pro probably has the most cohesive structure, etc., but 1L Property is made up of the bits that weren't important enough to be their own class. 

Real Estate transactions are mostly in their own class, Landlord/Tenant matters are mostly in their own class, Wills, Trusts and Estates has its own class, etc. Property is the stitched-together leftovers, with all the coherence of the monster in Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein. Personally, I suggest replacing Property with Administrative Law. It's a subject lawyers are far more likely to encounter. 




 Although obvious, it's worth reiterating a law exam grade is just how well you did on that one day, at that one time, on that one exam. It's not necessarily a reflection of how smart you are, how hard you studied, or how much you learned in a term.

Good Guy Law Professor at the end of one of my classes this year said he'd be willing to write us a recommendation regardless of what we got in his class precisely because he understood the above. 
























 Didn't see it today, but it's pretty darn common to have military helicopters flying in and out of the Pentagon. I don't mean to be rude, but I don't think there's any scoop to be had-just another day near the Pentagon. 




 Thanks, dcpanthersfan. I feel a bit annoyed to have been lied to, but I'm glad you saved me from calling the County Government to inquire about it and looking silly. (And I'm glad that people can go to A-SPAN for free.) 




 I was at a Giant in Arlington tonight, and a woman was panhandling asking for $2 so she could stay in a winter homeless shelter in the Courthouse neighborhood. I gave her the $2, but I'm wondering if homeless shelters really charge for people to stay there? (I've heard a panhandler near the Pentagon City Mall make that claim as well.)

I'd find it unsettling, to put it mildly, if there is really a charge to stay in local shelters, particularly when it is so cold outside. (I'd also find it strange, given that local governments around here frown upon panhandling.) 




 Ordinarily, federal workers have staggered schedules. Between gliding schedules, compressed schedules, and other changes, people get to work anywhere between 7-10ish and leave anywhere between 3:30-6:30ish.

Have everyone come in today for a handful of hours and then all leave at the same time, and you end up with the metro so full, people are at risk of being pushed onto the tracks, and complete gridlocked streets, just as the weather conditions start deteriorating.

Perhaps unscheduled telework/leave, followed by early dismissal would have cut out enough people from coming in to the office to avert a Commutageddon 2.0, but since Commutageddon in 2011, OPM has made a conscientious effort to put the safety of employees first, even if at times, they end up overreacting to a bust forecast. (See http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/commutageddon-a-year-later-would-the-same-fiasco-repeat/2012/01/26/gIQAhzgKTQ_blog.html) 




 It's like the cursed yogurt in the Simpsons. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_pqnsKWlpc t=0m30s

We'll be updating the dinosaur exhibit at the Smithsonian so it'll be scientifically accurate according to today's understanding of paleontology, instead of being a fossilized relic depicting the 1930s understanding of, well, fossilized relics. *That's good!*

It'll require the dinosaur exhibit be closed for five years. *That's bad.*

That time will allow the museum to dismantle, clean, and remount the dinosaur to be more accurate. *That's good!*

But in the process, there will inevitably be breakage and other damage to the dinosaurs. *That's bad.*

While the process is ongoing, there are still a zillion other free Smithsonian museums to explore, and there are other neat exhibits at the Natural History Museum besides fossil hall. *That's good!*

But none will satisfy the kids who are really into dinosaurs. *Can I go now?* 




 Happened to my 2011 17" Macbook Pro yesterday. Thankfully, it's still under AppleCare for another few weeks. Without warning it shutdown, and when I rebooted up, saw blue and white stripes at the Apple screen and had trouble getting past it. Apple Store is replacing the logic board. 




 *nods* That is really strange. I also went to an Apple store. (Heck, most of the independent mac retail/repair places have gone the way of the dodo, which is a real shame. There used to be a wonderful DC-area independent Apple-authorized repair shop that offered very affordable rentals for repair customers, but it went out of business a few years due to the Apple Store around the corner.) 




 Yep-you were right. It's the GPU. They'll be replacing the logic board, otherwise they would have charged me $525. I'm darn lucky it happened now instead of three weeks from now. 




 Ouch-I'm sorry to hear that! And thanks for the confirmation.

My laptop has never felt as speedy as I thought it should, for the top specs, maxed out RAM, and plenty of hard drive space left. I wonder if the logic board has always been a bit dodgy? 




 Thanks! :-) 




 I was using my 2011 17" Macbook Pro (first with Thunderbolt) and all of a sudden, it shutdown. Upon hitting the power button, I get as far as the Apple logo, but with a strange vertical blue/white lines. [Here's a picture.](http://imgur.com/Pq8qf1f  ) It did not want to progress past this at first, and it was even hesitant to shutdown when holding the power button at this point. It made a noise as if it was powering down, but didn't actually do anything for 2 or 3 tries. I was able to get into it by holding down the option button and selecting the startup drive. But clearly, something isn't right.

Thankfully, it's under AppleCare still for a few weeks, and I will take it in tomorrow, but I'm wondering what the heck this is? My googling leads me to think it might be the GPU gone bad? 




 Bad enough when civil forfeiture is done properly through legal channels. If the Gothamist's reporting on this is correct, I'm genuinely shocked and appalled at the situation. 









 Strange lawsuit. Under NY law, it is legal for women to be topless. Private property owners can prohibit it on their property, but unless there were signs posted or something of that nature, I don't understand how the building owners have a leg to stand on. 









 This point is a bit murky, I suppose. According to the linked article, BMA's records indicated that the painting in question was donated to them in 1937. Other articles seem to indicate, as you noted, that the item was on loan to the museum (but even if it was on loan, it WAS willed to the museum).

Either the museum owned it or it was willed to the museum (and she had passed before the painting was stolen). 




 This shouldn't come as a shock to anyone but the woman who claimed to have gotten it from a flea market and her lawyer. Basic first year property law: nobody can gain good title to stolen property, AKA the Irving principle.

In "The Ballad of Irving", Frank Gallop's classic parody of Lorne Green's "Ringo", the protagonist was Irving, the 142nd fastest gun in the West. One of the versus starts with "141 could draw faster than he, but Irving was looking for 143."

Well, just as with Irving, who would have been dead meat against the 141 fastest gun slingers but could take out #143, an innocent owner of stolen goods might have better title than someone coming along after them. Basic, black letter law. 









 What is the "life lesson" there? That it's okay for employers to screw employees?

 As I said, casual gamer who buys games from Amazon. I haven't been looking at GameStop until recently. 




 I'm just a casual gamer, so, I only buy a few Xbox 360 games a year. I mostly get them from Amazon.com. I recently moved to an area where there's a used game store (a national chain) within walking distance, and thought I'd check out the used price of Grand Theft Auto: V. It's around $55 for a used copy. The store is selling it new for $60. I know full well that across the street, Best Buy is selling it new for $40.

I mentioned to the clerk that they're selling it used for $55 when it's being sold new for $40 across the street, and he just shrugged and seemed uninterested. He certainly didn't make me a better offer.

Looking around, I didn't see any bargain used games. From what I saw, they were all only about $5 less than the new games they sell.

Is this standard for the used game market nowadays? Are these stores traps for the unwary, or is it just my local store? 




 Will do.

 One troubling element is just how much territory the border exception for searches covers100 miles. I've been stopped near White River Junction, Vermont by the Border Patrol for a checkpoint. Not an area I would consider being near the border, by any means.

They looked in my car, asked me and my passengers if we were all U.S. Citizens, and when we nodded, they let us go. I wonder if it would have been quite so easy if everyone in my car wasn't white. 




 I haven't seen anything as absurd as this since the Rakofsky v. Internet case. 




 Actually, I have had an issue with a cab driver driving in the wrong direction and not following my attempts at getting us in the right direction. Reported him to the cab regulators, got a refund and apology from the cab company and the cab driver was suspended. It got to the point where I became concerned for my safety with whereever the cab thought it was going, and I would have demanded to be let out, but we weren't in a great area, and either Uber didn't exist in DC yet or I hadn't heard of it and I was concerned I wouldn't be able to get another cab.

You're right, Gumburcules, DC isn't pleasantville. Getting dropped off in a random part the city isn't a great option. 




 It definitely is unpleasant, but the worst of it is the difficulty of keeping my eyes open so my eye doc can remove the lashes. In order to see the root of the lashes, the doc needs to use the light on the slit lamp. A side effect of distichia is light sensitivity.

I love my current eye doc for her patience and understanding. The first eye doc I found in DC yelled at me for having trouble keeping my eyes open as he shined a bright light in my face. Something that I understand normal people would have a hard time dealing with, and it's a lot worse with light sensitivity. *rueful look* 




 I have it too. It's irksome. Every once in a while, I have to get the double-set of lashes plucked.

 Again? This isn't the first time this sort of thing has happened at the zoo... 




  I can see hypothetical scenarios where people might suffer harm from the breach. Fraud protection replaces losses from debit or credit card fraud (if reported within a certain time period), but if a card is suddenly frozen or canceled due to fraud, it can cause economic harm and other harms to consumers who may find themselves unexpectedly temporarily unable to access funds. Not everyone has cash on hand.

I have yet to see evidence that Target was negligent, but that doesn't mean they weren't. It's early yet. 




 Presumably, any suit would be based on negligence, which in common law requires three things: (1) a duty of care; (2) a breach of said duty; and (3) damages arising from the breach of the duty of care.

I am not your lawyer. I am not giving you any legal advice other than to tell you that if you believe you have been harmed, seek a lawyer.

All I can tell you is that as a consumer who shopped at Target myself in the time period of the data breach using a debit card, at the moment, I have no cause to sue Target. First, there has been no actual harm to me as of yetthere has been no fraud on my card, I have not been blocked from using my funds, etc. Second, I have yet to see evidence that Target was negligent. They may well have been, financial data is supposed to be private afterall, but until more information is available about what the hackers did and how, and what Target could have or should have done to prevent it, it's a little early to conclude that Target was negligent. (I AM angered that for a couple of days, Target was claiming that the anonymous executive cited in the press was wrong and that no PINs were known to be compromised, and today, lo and behold, PINs are known to be compromised. That might be negligence, if people were harmed by hackers using their PINs to drain accounts in the past couple of days, but again, no such stories have hit the press as of yet.)

 Thanks! :-) 




 Thanks! I guess this is the sort of thing they might have told people on October 1st, but rather than make us come in for 15 minutes just to put up away messages and stow files, etc., my boss had my team stow our files the night before and telework on the 1st for 10 minutes, so, yay for not spending more time commuting than working the 1st day of the shutdown, but we might have missed out on some last minute instructions. :P 




 Looking at the news, it seems that there's a possibility the shutdown might be ending soon. *fingers crossed* If the shutdown does indeed end, how will workers be notified that we should go back to work/what is the time frame? Might I got to sleep at 10PM with no official word that a deal is in place, only to wake up at 10AM and log on to CNN.com to find out I should have been at work an hour and a half prior, or will there be a day in between a deal and being called back into service?

 Not a mall. The Mall. As in the park between the US Capitol and the Washington Monument. 




 The thing is that this isn't a budget cut. Washington Monument Syndrome applies to discretionary cuts. Here, federal law mandates cessation of all activities that are not directed at imminent threats to people or property. 




 No, no it's not, and it's not Washington Monument Syndrome, Cardine. Washington Monument Syndrome is a real thing, but it applies to cuts in funding to an agency that gives the agency discretion on what to cut. When agencies choose to cut visible, high-profile things in the hopes it draws public attention and leads to cuts being reversed, that's Washington Monument syndrome.

Here, what is funded and what isn't funded is NOT discretionary. It's mandated by the Anti-Deficiency Act, a federal statute that conceivably carries criminal penalties. Nobody has ever been convicted of violating the Act, but agencies have been dinged for it, and prosecution is still possible for violations.

In the event of a lapse in appropriations (AKA a government shutdown), the Act (31 U.S.C.  1342) prohibits continuing to employ personnel in excess of that authorized by law, except for emergencies involving protecting people or property.

So, under the Act, it is allowable to declare park rangers, park police, etc. essential to patrol areas to protect monuments and parks. It's allowable to use such personnel to respond to emergencies and protect people. It is not allowable to use such personnel to keep facilities open.

There was a WMATA (Metro) worker killed on Sunday in a work-related accident in one of the Metro tunnels near Union Station. Ordinarily, the National Transportation Safety Board would investigate the incident. Based on the above part of the Anti-Deficiency Act, however, the agency determined that responding to this incident did not constitute addressing an "imminent threat to the safety of human life..." If there was a known ongoing threat to human life, the NTSB could and would respond, but since the incident had happened and there was no known imminent threat, they could not.

This isn't the Presidential administration trying to inflict pain to rally support. They are following the law. 




 Gabriel Quirk! He's a really nice guy. 




 Moreover, any concession at all would mean the Republicans would demand another concession the next time this fight came up. Six weeks from now. Because the CR the Senate passed is only to fund the government for another six weeks.

Fulfilling a new Republican demand every six weeks would look little different from a Romney/Ryan presidency. There is no way in hell the President can give in to this extortion. 




 Hmm-I'll look into that. Thanks! Mind my asking what a reasonable price is these days? 




 Wow. I had not heard that they'd be dropping that much! (And I suppose I might want to save just in general to buy around the holidays when prices drop overall...)

 I don't have a Blu Ray player yet, and I don't know if I'd be getting one. I have a lot of DVDs, but I haven't bought one in months, since I've been relying on HD channels or streaming via Netflix or Amazon Prime over buying physical media, so, I'm leaning towards skipping Blu Ray. 




 Hi all. I know that lots of people recommend Panasonic's plasma TVs, but unfortunately, Costco doesn't seem to carry them. I want to go with Costco so I have 90 days to return it if there is a problem, as well as for the extended warranty (Costco tacks 1 year on to the manufacturer's warranty).

This link is pretty representative of what my local Costco has: http://www.costco.com/51-inch-tvs-and-above.html

It's hard judging the quality of the screens in Costco due to the lighting conditions, and solely looking at the specs, I can't tell what's worthwhile. Any recommendations? Would the 55" Vizio (E551D-A0) be a reasonable purchase?

I'm in an apartment that gets a decent amount of sunlight. It has blinds but not blackout shades. I'd primarily be using Fios HD channels and VOD, an XBox 360 (for games), and I have an Apple TV for streaming, so, SmartTV is not essential. I don't know if 3D is particularly essential, either, as I generally prefer 2D movies in theaters. 




 It was a one month extension and it's expired. The original deadline was August 31, and it was extended to Sept. 30th. See http://www.washingtonian.com/blogs/capitalcomment/local-news/dc-taxi-drivers-protest-deadline-for-credit-card-readers.php. 




 It's not exactly a vacation. I'm relieved to hear I'll be paid eventually, but that doesn't help pay bills now.

Can't treat it as an opportunity to go galavanting when one can be due at work the morning after at any time. 




 Actually, federal employees may be exempt from the seeking work requirements. They are exempt in DC, at least. "Furloughed federal employees will not be required to obtain job search contacts if they file for unemployment benefits in the District of Columbia." http://does.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/does/page_content/attachments/FAQs-FED%20GovtShutdown%20ONLY-October%202013-FINALv2.pdf 




 What sheriffs do is neatly illustrated by the unusual duties of U.S. Marshals in Washington, DC. Because DC has no sheriff's office and it is not a state, the US Marshals Service has been assigned the functions that a sheriff's office would normally carry out. In DC, serving legal papers is done by private process servers, but if they have difficulty, it's done by US Marshals. In DC, security at the DC (non-federal) courthouse is done by US Marshals, as is prisoner transport. In DC, evictions are supervised by US Marshals. 




 Hell, in 1906, the Supreme Court itself put a sheriff on trial for contemptit was and is the only criminal trial in Supreme Court history. For those interested in this, and it is one heck of an interesting story, I strongly recommend the book "Contempt of Court: The Turn-of-the-Century Lynching That Launched a Hundred Years of Federalism" by Mark Curriden and Leroy Phillips. A great read. 




 Um, what on Earth gives you the idea that nobody can arrest a sheriff or that the authority of a sheriff exceeds that of federal law enforcement? Federal law enforcement can most definitely work in a county regardless of the local sheriff's wishesyou need to reread the Supremacy Clause and the line of cases from 1796's *Ware v Hylton*, 3 Dall. 199, to 1816's *Martin v. Hunter's Lessee*, 14 U.S. 304, to 1859's *Albeman v. Booth*, 62 U.S. 506, to 1958's *Cooper v. Aaron*, 358 U.S. 1, to 1982's *Edgar v. MITE Corp.*, 457 U.S. 624, and there are plenty of other cases out there that make it quite clear that federal statutes trumps state laws, and federal officials exercising this authority trumps state officials.

And federal law enforcement can most certainly arrest a sheriff. Or a mayor. Or a governor. Or any other state or local official. 




 Is it powered by unicorn tears? It sounds rather suspicious to me. 




 A good question, and not one that's easy to answer. Certain parts of the ACA would go into effect regardless, but what is enforced and what is not enforced may depend on whether funding on enforcement is restricted. (AKA, defunding wouldn't stop the Act from requiring insurance companies to follow rules X, Y, and Z, but it might stop the DOJ and HHS from being able to go after insurance companies that follow those rules.) 




 Breathe. 




 Wow-thanks for the gold! :) 




 One of the things the House Republicans attached to some of their continuing resolutions was a clause that would allow employers to opt out of having their employees' health care cover anything they find objectionable. This basically transfers the religious exemption to the coverage mandates of the ACA from just religious organizations to all employers. If you are unfortunate enough to work for a zealot who thinks contraception is wrong, you wouldn't be able get contraception through your employer-based health insurance if that element of the GOP's hostage demand goes through.

(Of course, given how broadly it was worded, people working for a company controlled by a Jehovah's Witness might not be able to get a blood transfusion paid for by their employer-based health insurance. Yay Republicans.) 




 It's not that talking points are bad, it's that they lack details and nuance. The West Wing described the problem with ten word answers really well: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85dKvletfSo

The transcript of that speech by President Bartlett is this: "Ten-word answers can kill you in political campaigns. They're the tip of the sword. Here's my question: What are the next ten words of your answer? Your taxes are too high? So are mine. Give me the next ten words. How are we going to do it? Give me ten after that, I'll drop out of the race right now. Every once in a while... every once in a while, there's a day with an absolute right and an absolute wrong, but those days almost always include body counts. Other than that, there aren't very many unnuanced moments in leading a country that's way too big for ten words. I'm the President of the United States, not the President of the people who agree with me. And by the way, if the left has a problem with that, they should vote for somebody else." 




 Prior to the Affordable Care Act, Medicare and Medicaid did not cover most dental care. Given how difficult it was to just get passed what the ACA does, it wouldn't have been politically possible to expand benefits to include dental care. As you put it, it's extremely costly. 




 Both. That the jobs that are furloughed are referred to as non-essential doesn't mean that they are not important, just that they don't have the potential for having an immediate impact on life or property, the way that a police officer or doctor would, or the staff that ensures Social Security checks go out. 




 I find it appalling that merely 2 weeks after federal law enforcement officers responded to the shooting at the Washington Navy Yard, those officers and their colleagues remain on duty but will go unpaid until the shutdown is over. 




 And yet there are many other families of federal employee that rely on income from work performed that will not be paid until the shutdown ends.

Which is not to knock the military or suggest I don't respect and appreciate what they do. But I also respect and appreciate border patrol agents, US Marshals, the FBI, and other federal law enforcement officers who risk their lives on a daily basis defending the US. They still work during the shutdown, but won't be paid until the shutdown ends. 




 Most people still have no idea what is in the ACA. That's why you have people like this guy in Kentucky happily signing up for Kynect, the health benefit exchange established by ACA, while saying "This beats Obamacare, I hope." http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/22/kentucky-obamacare_n_3801054.html 




 Democrats are refusing to compromise because they aren't being offered anything. The government operating isn't a Democratic win-it's the way things are supposed to work. It's non-partisan.

Similarly, raising the debt ceiling is also not a Democratic win. It's also non--partisan and the way things are supposed to work.

Republicans are trying to attach all sorts of elements of the Republican platform to these two items. (And note that the continuing resolution to fund the government is only for 6 weeks of funding. It is absurd to suggest Democrats should allow major changes to Obamacare or any other Republican goodie on a bill that allows for only 6 weeks of funding, even if you think that merely funding the government is somehow a Democratic win!) 




 I think it probably would have. Remember, most Members of Congress are multi-millionaires. Their congressional salary is a pittance compared to their investment income. 




 It doesn't have to be with being considered essential, since essential government employees aren't furloughed, but they also won't be paid until the shutdown ends. (They are, however, in a better position than the furloughed employees in that we have no guarantee of backpay whereas they are sure to be paid eventually.) 




 It will still be funded even it a shutdown. It will not be funded if the continuing resolutions offered by the Republican-controlled House was signed into law.

(And note that the continuing resolution is only for 6 weeks. That's right, folks. Republicans are holding government employees hostages, and get to do it all over again a mere six weeks once the shutdown ends. Yay!) 




 Yes. Economists ooh and ah or shriek when the month to month job growth/loss moves 150,000 jobs in either direction in any given month. Currently, around 800,000 government employees are furloughed. That's a pretty damn big impact on the economy. 




 The Kreeger Museum is really neat. It's the private collection (and in the former home) of a former GEICO chairman, and is a fascinating and eclectic mix. Worth the cost. 




 I'm not so sure. Neither side can afford to quickly cave, and there is no compromise that could be reach that wouldn't be seen as a cave. Unless something happens tomorrow, once a shutdown starts, I don't see it ending in just a day or two. 




 In this political climate, I don't see how we can get retroactive pay. The constituents of those pushing us into a shutdown are hardly likely to be thrilled with their Congresspeople if they let us get paid for no work (even if the lack of being able to work was not our choice). 









 In the end, most people are going to put a case on it, so you can't tell what color it is anyway. 




 I hear the line at DC area Apple Stores was huge yesterday. I got to the downtown Verizon Store at 7AM, was the 9th person in line, and an hour later, they started letting people in to the store 9 people at a time. Didn't get much easier/better than that. 




 Every federal employee has given their fingerprints to the government. Nearly every unpaid college or post-grad federal intern has given their fingerprints to the government. Every law enforcement related officer have given their fingerprints to the government. Most licensed security guards, PIs, etc. have given their fingerprints to the government. Nearly everyone working with kids, from schoolbus drivers to teachers to administrators to after school people have given their fingerprints to the government. Everyone who used the now mostly defunct Registered Traveler systems (like CLEAR) gave their fingerprints AND retina scans to the government. Every person arrested has given their fingerprints to the government. 

TL;DR point 1: Government already has a zillion fingerprints, so who give a damn if they can get more?

Point 2: Buying an iPhone 5s is optional. Using a fingerprint in lieu of a passcode on an iPhone 5s is also optional. Let people make their own choices. 




 Frederick is lovely, but if those commute times are acceptable, one might as well look at an apartment in Rockville itself. Rockville is, well, 0 minutes to Rockville, and it's also about an hour to Baltimore (more with rush hour, but you probably can schedule seeing friends around rush hour). Rockville is 15 minutes from DC and is WMATA-accessible via the Red Line.

The big "but" (no Principal Skinner jokes, please!) is that you probably won't find a townhouse for that. You can probably find a decent apartment for the 1600 range though, including pet-friendly apartments with dog parks. 




 I'll second Georgetown Bagelry. The bagels are delicious, the staff and the owner (Mary) are really nice people, and the pricing is reasonable. What's not to love?

I'm moving from Bethesda to Arlington, and easy access to Georgetown Bagelry is what I'll miss most. (Not to hijack the thread, but if anyone knows of a decent source of bagels, for the love of Pete, tell me! Tell me!) 




 Take Canal Road/M street towards the Key Bridge as an example. There's an intersection at the Whitehurst Freeway where people get stuck in the intersection all the time. Not because they are doing anything wrong, but because drivers up ahead suddenly stop and put on their turn signal to merge into the left-most lane that goes straight on Canal Road/M street, blocking the green light for the middle lane that goes right onto Key Bridge.

Someone can have two green lights in front of them, traffic moving, and all of a sudden, everyone gets stuck because of a car(s) blocking the lane. That's an example of an intersection in DC where one can get stuck in the middle of the intersection and have it not be their fault. 




 Sometimes in DC, one gets stuck blocking the intersection when traffic jams up ahead without warning. Yes, one isn't supposed to block the box. One also isn't supposed to treat a green light like a stop sign.

At least with a speeding camera or a red light camera, someone is doing something against the law that is within their control. When a police officer pulls over a crosswalk encroacher, he has theoretically observed the traffic conditions at the time. A camera aimed at crosswalk encroachers, on the other hand, can easily pick up drivers who got stuck without being at fault. 




 It would make a lot more sense to have given Harry Potter books to local homeless shelters with a high kid/adolescent population instead of throwing them in a dumpster. 




 I'd like to see a 60 minute made for TV movie version of Walter Miller's novelette The Darfstellar. (It's not long enough to make it a full Silver Screen movie.) 




 Well howdy, neighbor!

I agree. A more rationale solution is to cut class sizes, and I think alumni want them to do it to tighten admissions standards. I don't think we're at all happy about the drop in the rankings, not that rankings are the end all, be all, but the slide hasn't been good.

Still, if they aren't willing to cut classes and want to at least maintain them, a new building is a good idea, and you might as well build with extra capacity.

The buses usually will say Blue Route (Main Campus/Metro) or Red Route (WCL/Metro). The shuttle bus that goes to WCL does indeed park across the street from the Metro, whereas the Blue shuttle to Main Campus parks on the same side of the street as the stop. 




 I'm listening to it right now and enjoying it so far. :-) (One of you is apparently my neighbor in N. Bethesda-I'm currently in Bethesda!)

As a current WCL LL.M. student and WCL JD alum, I'd like to respond to what you said about WCL's new building by noting that WCL has already outgrown its current building, just in terms of finding enough classrooms. 

In my LL.M. program, I've wound up in lousy classroom spaces I never saw as a JD student-classrooms where there isn't enough room to have a laptop and casebook in front of you simultaneously without putting one in your lap, and classrooms where several students' won't be able to see either of the whiteboards in the room without turning around.

More space is needed just for the numbers as they are now. 




 Seems like a good idea. It's centrally located for a lot of commuters who'd like to pick up something from a big box store on their way home. 




 I wonder if the guy is linked to the ex-real estate broker in this Consumerist story from July 2012: http://consumerist.com/2012/07/13/colorado-family-kept-out-of-own-home-for-8-months-by-squatters-claiming-adverse-possession/ 




 Agreed. I'm a WCL JD grad and current LL.M. student there, and it's a great school with great professors. I started the J.D. program back when its rank with pretty much on part with UMD (I had gotten into both).

I am appalled at the idea of increasing the study body. I think we need to reduce the number of students from their current levels to improve our rankings and employment statistics. Increasing them seems like lunacy.

But for strong clinical programs and for the strength of our professors, I definitely agree that WCL easily contends with other area schools. 




 Tell that to Maryland Judge Robert Nalley. No, not because he has heard cases involving letting air out of a tire, because he committed the offense, plead guilty, and was hit with a $500 fine and 6 months probation. He also was suspended from his duties without pay for five days.

 Yeah, no, not exactly.... Nudity done in protest is sometimes deemed to be protected speech, but it's not always. (Otherwise, every strip club in the country would have full nude dancing "in protest".)

It's a tough case to make, not easy. 




 Um, no. Your claim that an indecent exposure charge is "easily beaten under a First Amendment defense" is simply not true. Nudity can be protected speech, but it's rare and simply being naked in public isn't enough to be protected. To quote Justice Souter's concurring opinion in 1991's Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560, "Nudity itself is not inherently expressive conduct." 




 Excellent-thanks, /u/rawnoodles10 , /u/TerraOperative , and /u/bobroberts7441 . I'm glad my instincts that it's the power steering causing the vapor weren't far off. 




 Hi Reddit. I have a '98 Corolla with about 117,000 miles on it or so. Last month, I saw some white vapor coming out of my hood, took it to the local mechanic, and they found nothing wrong. Then it started making a bad sounding noise under the hood, and I mentally prepared to start looking for cheap used cars. Fortunately, I took it to my trusted mechanic (not as local since I moved, but still localish), and they said I was low on power steering fluid. Put some in, noise went away, great!

Except today, I saw white vapor (with a not-so-great smell) under the hood again. I noticed it after I had to move the wheel back and forth to get out of a terribly-designed parking lot, which makes me thing that maybe the vapor is the power-steering overheating when I move the wheel? Would that make sense, and if so, what are the possible causes? (And if that doesn't make sense, well, er, what are the possible causes?)

Many thanks in advance for whatever advice you have (besides time to start saving up for a used car *rueful look*)! 




 Yep-I gave it three chances. They didn't show. I use Uber now. 




 Oh, definitely not. DSHEA was a huge win for the dietary supplement industry. 




 Agreed, although I'm unsure that drugs need to be redefined. Instead, I'd do away with the dietary supplement category, redistributing supplements to the food or drug categories. Things like ginkgo should be regulated as drugs. 




 It's not a technicality-your complaint is that these items should have information that inform consumers how to use them as drugs. The simple answer is that if they are intended to be used as drugs, they need to go through the premarket process to become drugs! 




 Herbal products can make some health claims, but they cannot claim to treat, cure, mitigate, or diagnose diseases or conditions. Any product that makes such a claim, be it herbal or otherwise, is a drug and needs premarket approval from the FDA.

Herbal products can't state a dosage because they cannot claim to treat, cure, mitigate, etc., and those claims are tied to dosages.

It's not that herbal products are being specially targeted-classifying things as drugs, cosmetics, devices, food, and supplements are fundamental aspects of the regulatory structure in the U.S., and products are defined by the claims they make. 




 This is a question for your lawyer. Generally, you cannot gain good title to stolen property through theft. Restitution is not the same paying for the items you stole. But, theoretically, the amount of restitution you would have to pay could have been lessened by the return of stolen goods (pre-trial, not now). 




 Respectfully, if you are claiming that DSHEA was passed at the behest of the pharmaceutical industry or that it unfairly limits/restricts/confines dietary supplements, you're mistaken. DSHEA was passed at the behest of the dietary supplement industry itself. It was the biggest legislative victory they could have hoped for-a massive giveaway to the industry.

Dietary supplements are exempt from the premarket approval safety and efficacy requirements of drugs, they are exempt from the premarket approval safety requirements of food, and they can make health claims that foods are not allowed to make.

Dietary supplements are not confined to a status. Food and drug law is entirely reliant upon classification as to what they are, classifications that are largely based on manufacturers' claims. Change the claim, change ingredients as needed, and you can become a drug or food.

After some bad publicity about the ingredients of supplements, some energy drink manufacturers voluntarily chose to reclassify their products from dietary supplement to food. This merely requires ensuring that the ingredients meet the safety requirements of food (generally recognized as safe, etc.) and changes the sort of claims the manufacturers can make about the product.

Note that supplement manufacturers don't want drug status. The whole point of operating in the dietary supplement space is to circumvent the requirements of demonstrating safety, efficacy, and going through the process of becoming an approved drug. If the maker of supplement X were to want to make a drug claim (as in X cures Y), they'd have to file a New Drug Application with the FDA, do clinical trials, there'll be a back and forth with the FDA on efficacy and safety, etc. The supplement sphere avoids all this. 




 This is the sort of escalation that occurs when judges are soft on perpetrators of picnic basket theft. 









 I'm not sure I understand what you're saying here. If you are assuming that repealing DSHEA to restore the FDA's jurisdiction over dietary supplements would lead to an increase in their cost, I disagree and note that the cost of energy drinks is pretty much the same, whether they are currently classified as foods or as supplements. 




 Yes-the FTC enforces the relevant law against false and deceptive advertising, but they have limited resources and even then, can only take on a product once it is on the market making false or deceptive claims. Moreover, the FTC generally has to rely on court actions.

The FDA, on the other hand, can deal with unsafe ingredients before they make it to market, and can often get products off of shelves via administrative actions that do not require a lengthy court procedure. 




 Congress is right that there's a problem, but they should be blaming themselves for it. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 stripped the FDA of most regulatory oversight over dietary supplements. Drugs and food must be shown to be safe to be on the market. Not so for dietary supplements. Drugs must be shown to be effective to be on the market. Not so for dietary supplements.

Take energy drinks as an example. In your average grocery store cooler, you'll find cans of energy drinks that are regulated as food and others that are regulated as dietary supplements, side by side. The average consumer has no idea that most ingredients of the cans that say Nutritional Facts on the label have to be shown to be generally recognized as safe before going on the market, whereas the cans that say Supplement Facts have no assurance of safety.

 Thanks. :) And I'm with you on preferring a firmer fish.

I like my fish cooked all the way through-I was hoping sous vide could help me avoid having the outside be just right but the core not being cooked-but only just cooked through. 




 It wasn't so much a recipe as it was looking at the various charts out there of egg cooking times, picking a time, and putting the eggs, in shell, in the water bath.

I did a 65 egg, which made the yolk spreadable, almost jelly-like (and utterly delicious on brioche!). Left it in the water bath for about an hour. 




 That sounds tasty-thanks! 




 How do you all store your Anova when it's not in use? Do I need some sort of case or do I just stick it in a cabinet once its dry? 




 *nods* Thanks, okcukv. 




 I got my Anova this morning, and so the first thing I did was make sous vide eggs, which came out beautifully! Tonight, I tried to make salmon, and it came out with the texture of cat food and with what, I am guessing, might be the flavor of cat food too. I'm not sure what I did wrong (maybe everything, I don't know?).

I used frozen sushi-grade salmon from Whole Foods, put it directly in the water bath without thawing it in the fridge, set the water bath for 52C, and left it there for an hour.

Did I go wrong with the frozen salmon? Did I go wrong with the temperature? Did I leave it in there too long (I thought that it was hard to overcook things based on leaving it in the water bath for a sustained period of time?) I know that by putting it in the water bath from the frozen state, I didn't season it or flavor it ahead of time, but that wouldn't affect the texture or the deeply unpleasant flavor. 




 You don't read as many stories about cab drivers assaulting passengers because it happens too frequently to qualify as national news. 




 There are plenty of successful lawyers who were not on law journal. Your odds of being a successful lawyer drops significantly, however, if you find yourself before the Honor Board. It's just not worth getting disciplined by your school and potentially have trouble with the character and fitness committee. Do the right thing.

 Welcome to the Dartmouth family! /u/stepintomyd0j0 has good suggestions. My only addition is to note that L.L. Bean has an amazing return policy (AKA they let you return pretty much anything at any time). If you are unused to New England winters, I might suggest getting things from L.L. Bean so that if they turn out to not be warm enough, or a good fit, or otherwise to your liking/comfort, you can return them and get something else. 




 Yep! I had one 10 years ago back in my time working tech support for a university. An older professor came in with his PowerPC tower and said he had a broken cupholder-I was both horrified and excited to learn the legends were true. :P 




 Did you even read my comment? I agree that Israel, like any country, does things one might criticize, and that criticizing Israel is not a sign of anti-semitism. If one only criticizes Israel, anti-semitism may become a reasonable inference.

Russia's genocidal policies towards the Chechens eclipsed anything Israel has done towards Palestinians, and yet Roger Waters voiced no criticism of them and indeed, continues to perform in Russia. (Not to mention Russian persecution of homosexuals, current actions towards the Ukraine, the invasion of Georgia, the murder of journalists (such as Anna Politkovskaya, Anastasia Baburova, and Stanislav Markelov), etc.)

China's human rights violations are of such a scale, it is difficult to choose a place to begin. Given that Waters has invoked apartheid in his criticism of Israel, however, perhaps a good starting point is China's discrimination towards it rural workers as part of the hukou system. Many have described the hukou system as apartheid (see http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4424944.stm , for example). China's actions towards Tibet could be said to be analogous to apartheid. And yet Waters voices no criticism of China. And Roger Waters performs in China. 




 Waters has repeatedly played in China and Russia. He played in Venezuela while Hugo Chavez was in power.

Criticizing Israel does not equal being anti-semitic. Criticizing ONLY Israel, however, and one has to wonder. 




 Ah! That makes sense. I hadn't realized that the Virginia tax rate included local taxes. 




 How are the taxes not as bad? I'd have to earn a quarter of a million dollars to pay the same tax rate in Maryland that I pay in Virginia? 









 Please don't down vote me into oblivion for saying thisI have a hard time visualizing math. But I looked at tax rates just the other day, and I was surprised that Virginia state income tax rate seems higher for me than Maryland would be.

Virginia's tax rate (unless I'm doing this wrong), for people earning over $17,000 a year, is 720+5.75% of the excess over $17000. Maryland's tax rate for people earning $3,000-$100,000 per year is $90+4.75% for the excess over $3,000.

To be taxed at the 5.75% Virginia is, I'd have to earn over $250,000 and it would only be 5.75% for the amount in excess over $250,000 (plus $12,700).

Am I missing something? (And again, that's not a rhetorical question, I'm truly wondering if I'm missing something?)

*EDITED to add the word Virginia in the last sentence of first paragraph. 




 Yay! I hope more schools move to that model. 




 I don't understand why property law is a required 1L course. All the other core classes cover area of law that one might practice in. Property Law The Class is just scraps of whatever couldn't be turned into its own class, like Wills and Estates, Real Estate, Taxation, etc., and so it encompasses almost nothing practical. A 2 week session covering black letter, common law claims like conversion, stolen property, trespass, etc. would be sufficient!

Property should be replaced by Administrative Law. Like the rest of the 1L core, Admin. is its own area of practice, and it is an area of practice that is a fundamental element of nearly every other area of law. I didn't take Admin. law until I went back for my LL.M., and in retrospect, I really regret not taking it as a 2L. There were so many upper-level courses I took as a 2L and 3L that were heavily admin. law based, and my understanding of them would have been so much better had I been given a fuller understanding of Chevron, Auer, Meade, Skidmore, etc. 




 It's doable, but only you can say if you're overextending yourself. How much sleep you'll need, how much study time you'll need, etc., those are the big things to consider, and nobody here can answer that for you.

0 debt would be an awesome thing. But it's also important that you get the very best grades you can, network at every law school event that puts you in touch with practitioners, etc. If you're coming into classes exhausted every day, that's not good. 




 Not to repeat myself, but Scalia's dissent Decker v. Northwest Environmental Defense Center is the biggest bizarre shift in rationales, given the doctrinal importance of Auer and given that Auer was an unanimous decision that Scalia himself authored.

(There have been major logical inconsistencies in terms of Chevron, Meade, and Skidmore [and Auer] as well, but I will be fair and note that that problem doesn't fall just on Scalia's shoulders but on the shoulders of the entire Court.) 




 (See, for example, Scalia's dissent in Decker v. Northwest Environmental Defense Center, where Scalia blasts the majority opinion in Auer v. Robbins without any acknowledgement that he wrote the darn opinion in Auer himself!) 




 On the other hand, his administrative law decisions have become increasingly erratic over time. This was not the first time he has, without explanation of how he has evolved on the matter or even why stare decisis shouldn't apply, criticized the natural consequence or the rule of an administrative law decision he authored. It's just the first time he misstated the facts of the case. 




 No, same price throughout. 




 Dorms vary greatly at Dartmouth. Some (like East Wheelock) can be spacious, others not so much. But friends and I always felt comfortable. :-)

And housing isn't guaranteed as far as I recall (*sigh* now I feel old-I don't remember these things), but so long as you don't change your D-plan at the last minute, you shouldn't have a problem getting housing. You most certainly are not expected to house offcampus or at a frat. Many do, but it certainly is not required/expected! 




 As a law student, in the Fall and Spring, I liked studying at the zoo. 




 Rand Paul gives two examples that he thinks demonstrates why the U.S. Department of Education should be abolished and both completely fail to support his argument. His example of the NYC rubber rooms with teachers NYC is waiting to fire has nothing to do with federal laws or regulations and everything to do with the structures NY and NYC established. That example is all on the State and city.

Senator Paul's wanting to pay some teachers more, some teachers less, and fire some teachers, also has nothing to do with federal funds, federal regulations, federal laws, or the U.S. Department of Education. That is also a matter of state and local politics/laws/regulations/contracts.

Senator Paul seems to be calling for federal funds to flow to state educational agencies and schools without any federal restrictions on how the funds can be used. Current federal restrictions on funds include allowability (money from a grant has to be used on allowable things that are reasonable/necessary for the grant's purposeno refitting the teacher's lounge with funds intended to help disadvantaged children, for example), accountability/transparency (states/schools must be able to account for how federal funds were spent, i.e. no money disappearing into a black hole), federal funds must supplement and not supplant state/local funds (federal funds are supposed to boost schools but not be a way for states to take money they would have spent on education and spend it elsewhere or lower taxes, etc.), etc.
No states or territories are required to accept federal education money, but if they take it, it comes with federal strings. It's not just a pool of free money to run out and buy every teacher and student an iPad.

The U.S. Department of Education plays no role in curriculum choices. The U.S. Department of Education plays no role in whether or not schools are unionized. The U.S. Department of Education has no role in hiring teachers, firing teachers, or their salaries. Education still IS a state and local matter. The U.S. Department's role in K-12 education is supplemental funds. Yes, the funds come with rules on how they can be spent. No, this doesn't make the U.S. Department of Education incompetent, evil, or unnecessary. 




 Gotcha. Yes, I agree.... DSHEA is a terrible law. I didn't mean to put words in your mouth. It's just that saying that the FDA isn't required to oversee/verify efficacy sounds like they could do it but are choosing not to. 




 It's not that the FDA allows it, it's that the FDA is unable to prohibit it. (First Amendment.) 




 Not quitebecause of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, the FDA isn't ALLOWED to oversee or verify the efficacy or safety of many dietary supplements and their ingredients. It's not the FDA's fault. 




 Government bodies with bureau in the name are often a subdivision of a larger agency. The FBI's parent agency is the Department of Justice. The Bureau of Indian Affairs is part of the Department of the Interior. That said, the National Park Service is also part of the Department of the Interior. That the one has bureau in the name and one doesn't has no legal significanceit's purely a question of naming. 

The IRS is part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Patent and Trademark Office is part of the Department of Commerce,  the Food and Drug Administration is part of the Department of Health and Human Services (and prior to 1940 was part of the Department of Agriculture), etc. It's just the name that Congress chose to give them.

All of the examples you gave, by the way, ARE agencies. They all have statutes that outline their authority and area of influence. That the FBI doesn't have agency in its name and the CIA does has no legal significance. Both are agencies as a matter of administrative law.

 Not to be pedantic, but the FCC is an agency, not a committee.

Agencies have the power to regulate in the field delegated to them by Congress, but statutes trump regulations. Agencies get to interpret statutes and their interpretation of vague statutes is generally deferred to by the courts, but if the statute is clear, it is what it is.

So yes, Congress can certainly pass legislation that would ensure net neutrality. Would they? Almost certainly not-too many legislators are in telecom companies' pockets. 




 Yes, as others have said, you can (and need) to get it inspected before you get it registered. You do not need to have the title to get it inspected.

(I got my car inspected in VA a few months before I moved there, just to make sure there were no surprises with my car.) 




 And the relevance is....? He was arrested in the US for crimes committed in the US, he'll be tried in the US, and if found guilty, will be jailed in the US. He wasn't in Germany or other countries in the world-he was in the US. 




 No different than what's said at the [NY Daily News](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/texas-inmate-conviction-overturned-1980-behind-bars-article-1.1761084) or [The Root](http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/04/this_inmate_s_conviction_was_overturned_in_1980_but_he_s_still_in_prison.html?wpisrc=burger). The real fail is that only a few papers have covered this horror show so far. 














 Reading the [NYT article by Adam Liptak](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/04/us/04felony.html) the Alternet article references, Ryan Holle was aware that his car was going to be used as part of a robbery. The article states that Holle himself testified "that he had been told it might be necessary to 'knock out' Jessica Snyder."

If one wishes to debate the appropriateness of the felony murder rule, we can have that debate, but it is intellectually dishonest for Charles Grodin to present this case as though Holle had no knowledge his car would be used for a crime. 




 Crystal City and Pentagon City are pretty comparable, but Pentagon City has more immediate access to greenery through the park at 15th and South Joyce Street. Also, Pentagon City has the benefit of a 24 hour grocery store being right there. (It's one metro stop away if you live in Crystal City, but personally, I like being able to walk to Harris Teeter.)

If Pentagon City has the benefit of having Harris Teeter, Crystal City has the benefit of more upscale dining options.

It's one metro stop (or a 5 minute cab ride) between the two, so, really, either one is a good spot to live in. 




 Really? I mean, I wouldn't hang out at the mallway too many touristsbut I never have a problem getting too and from the metro, and the mall food court is convenient when I want to pick up something quick and cheap on my way home.  




 The Archstone building is REALLY close to the metro. And the Pentagon City Mall is right above the metro stop, so, that's right there too (not just Macy's, Nordstroms, Apple, and all the usual mall stores, but don't forget the convenience of the food court, which includes a Panera, McDonalds, Chipotle, Subway, etc.). You'd be right across the street from Costco, CVS, CPK, Chevy's, etc., a block away is Rite Aid, World Market, Noodles   Co, a thai place, a sports bar, an Irish pub,  and one block beyond that is Harris Teeter (grocery store) and Bed, Bath, and Beyond. You'd also be in walking distance of the Aurora Hills branch of the Arlington library, which is small, but they are quick to get in books from the rest of the Arlington library system if you put in a request.

I'm not sure what iidesune is talking about-it's an easy commute with no need to switch to the Red Line. You'd take the Blue Line from Pentagon City to Farragut West. It's five stops, and would take you around 19 minutes.

Do you have any specific questions about Pentagon City I could help with? 




 I do remember Spitzer stepping down. I remember Weiner stepping down. I don't remember Senator Vitter (R) stepping down after embroilment in a prostitution scandal (or scandals). Because he didn't. I don't remember Former SC Governor Mark Sanford (R) stepping down after sneaking away to Argentina, without telling anyone and therefore leaving his state without anyone in charge, to see his mistress, who he has since married, and oh, right, he's now in Congress.

Senator Vitter and Congressman Sanford both bill themselves as family values Republicans. Sanford referred to his own cheating on his wife (and by not following procedures to put the Lt. Governor in charge in his absence, cheating on his State) by saying "I think we all need grace and we all need love" but that love we all need doesn't apply to the LGQBT community because he is opposed to same sex marriage. Senator Vitter, who engaged in regular sex with prostitutes (allegedly with a diaper involved), is also an opponent of same-sex marriage.

Don't hump my leg and tell me you tripped, Senator and Congressman.

 This notice/FAQ does not require notice and comment. It's not a regulation. It's non-regulatory guidance. Other than that, you're not wrong, but you're giving people like /u/paleh0rse an inaccurate impression of the process.

This is non-regulatory guidance. It is not binding. It does not have the force of law in and of itself. It is, however, a statement outlining how the IRS intends to carry out its responsibilities and use its authority under existing law.

The IRS is stating its position that under existing law, bitcoins are treated as property for federal tax purposes, etc. If someone does not follow the guidance, the IRS cannot punish them for not following the notice, but they CAN attempt to punish them for violating the statutes and regulations that the IRS based the notice on.

This isn't a proposal. This is a statement of what the IRS believes the existing laws and regulations require and how the IRS will proceed. If you disagree with this interpretation, one can certainly make the argument that the IRS is wrong, but I sure wouldn't want to be the test case. 




 I can't EL5 (administrative law is a bit more complex than Schoolhouse Rock), but I can explain it. Administrative agencies all derive their power from some sort of enacting legislation (also known as an organic statute). The enacting legislation creates an agency and defines its authority and role. (There can be multiple statutes that govern an agency.)

Agencies are essentially delegated power through the enacting legislation over a certain sphere. In the example of the IRS, their sphere of delegated authority is taxation.

Congress does not need to decide the legal status of Bitcoin first because it has delegated the authority to make that determination to the IRS. An agency cannot go against the express will of Congress as reflected in the plain language of a statute. If, however, a statute is ambiguous, it is the role of an agency to fill in the gaps of the legislation.

 Arguing that publicizing Gox's losses is what killed Gox is akin to arguing that efforts to expose Bernie Madoff as running a ponzi scheme is what caused his investors to lose their money.

Publicizing the issues stopped the scheme from continuing on a little longer, but that's not the same as a rescue! Accepting deposits but not making withdrawals put Mt. Gox on the same level as a ponzi scheme, and no merger or buyout was going to be able to fix that issue.

 Hi all. I was wondering if any of you know of any good magic shows for adults in the DC area? I was thinking of going to Glenn Gary's Parlor Magic Show at some point, but never got around to it, and it has apparently since closed.

Are there any other regularly scheduled magic acts anywhere? 




 Thanks for the information! :) I'm really looking forward to this. One last question. Does the VIP pass only allow getting in the front of the line for one guest (not me as the one guest, but rather, is it only good to get to the front of the line to see, say, Ernie Hudson but not Ernie and Dirk Benedict)? 




 This looks really awesome. I've never been to a con before, but I think I'm going to go to this one. My question, though, is which ticket should I get? If I don't get the Geekend VIP pass, does that mean it is harder to get autographs/photo-ops? Will there be enough priority panel seating at each panel for VIPs to be reasonably assured of getting a spot?  




 When I was doing writing coaching, I charged time and a half for last minute jobs... 




 Which isn't to say that I'm fully on your side. :P I am perfectly comfortable with people being expelled based solely on allegations, but it is based on the totality of the evidence as part of a fair an equitable process.

Fairness is binarya process is either fair or unfair. Is there anyone ready to stand up for expulsions as part of an unfair process? 




 Childress's argument before the panel seems to be that those found guilty of sexual misconduct should be expelled without going through a fair and equitable process. That expulsions should occur on what school administrators "know". The problem, of course, is that what we "know" and what we can prove in a fair and equitable process are often different, and many mistakes are made when people focus on the former. 




 Good grief. Inside Higher Education quotes Linda Farstein as an analyst/consultant, with no mention of her history as a New York prosecutor A checkered career at best, given her appalling conduct in the Central Park Jogger case where she abused her position to help railroad five teenagers into wrongful convictions for rape. Years later, she showed no remorse or ability to objectively review evidence, by opposing the NY DA's recommendation to vacate the wrongful convictions.

Which isn't to say that Ms. Childress should be judged by the ideological company she keeps, but I am appalled by her words that safety is more important than a fair and equitable process. I am all for expelling students after an evidence-based, fair and equitable process. An allegation is evidence. An allegation may even be all the evidence required in some cases. But the notion that safety is more important than a fair and equitable process is probably the same sort of internal justification that allowed Fairstein to work so hard and putting (and then keeping) five innocent kids in prisonher job came to be about representing victims instead of doing justice and being the People's representative.

 Deborah Lipstadt's 1993 book "Beyond Belief: The American Press and the Coming of the Holocaust" is an interesting look at your question. It's been a few years since I've read it, but if I recall correctly, the reporters who were aware what was going on early on were initially disbelieved because there were rumors of German atrocities in WWI that turned out to be false. Some people, including editors, thought that what they were hearing were more of the same false rumors. 




 Which is rather irksome in an age where money is deemed to be speech when it comes from corporations, but federal employees can't post forward a fundraising email from the DNC, RNC, etc. to their closest friends. 









 I found the E E to be really unhelpful for Admin.

 Yes, it can. Exact criminal charge depends on the jurisdiction. Could be vandalism, criminal mischief, or other things along those lines.
