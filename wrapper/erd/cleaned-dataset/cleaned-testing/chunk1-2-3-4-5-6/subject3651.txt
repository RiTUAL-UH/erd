 Depends on the state you live in--sometimes the district as well.  





























 Maybe something like revival or revitalizing America?  Revitalize   revitalizing both have 'vital' in them (obviously lol), but maybe it can be applied in creative ways 




 Ed Show (Ed Schultz) - MSNBC   then Thom Hartmann does a 1-hr radio show w/ him weekly  














 I think he was busy w/ the budget committee and then did the swing through some of the western states. I totally feel you, however, I'm sure he waited this long to see if he is even able to come up with a viable financial backing for a campaign that can compete w/ all of the money guzzling candidates.  









 She is super obnoxious. Making me nauseous. Haaaha.  

































































































































 Clinical trials, outpatient surgery services  




 Keep your head up miss, you and your strength admired by many. :) 




 It's what we are here for :) glad the nurse had such an impact with such a small gesture  




 Maybe try working in an outpatient setting-- procedural clinic or something?  




 Khan academy, iTunes university  




 Go to the director of the nursing program with paper trail :) teachers have a curriculum they need to stick to and she's obviously not.  




 Ouch! Take it to the director of the nursing program; they have to stick to a curriculum. I agree 100% on keeping a paper trail- make sure you have everything ready when you see the director.

 Congrats!! Be diligent! 
















































































































































 Wow, what a horribly written article.  




 Those ears!  





























 Totally agree. I just emailed her about her downplaying Bernie.  




 You are awesome!  
























 This video has already [been posted] (http://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/34v93r/hillarys_faux_populism_is_no_match_for_bernie/). 












































 I though that in Denmark, Italy, Austria, Finland and Sweden, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland, minimum wages are laid down by collective agreements for a range of specific sectors? 





























 Lol I know :[, I started cleaning and decided to listen to it instead hahaha :) 




 I totally thought it was my internet!! Hahahah 




 You are very welcome! 












































 That is awesome!! 



















 LOVE.  














 It took a while for me to load, I just had to wait a moment and then it played.  












































 From what I have seen, he tends to update it periodically--maybe as he schedules events? Hopefully, when/if he announces that he may have some dates to put up there. :) 







































 [This](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/15/hillary-clinton-minimum-wage_n_7075258.html) is what I found.  She never likes to give details, only vague responses, haha. 

















































 Thanks! :)

 I guess I need to talk to some more of my fellow nurses at work :D

 go for it!
 









 I was totally thinking the same thing. Insanely annoying and not to mention, super condescending.  







































 Totally agree!!! 






















































 love it, what a great idea! 














 Have fun!! 












































 Oh yes, #1 fan 




  I totally felt the same way :) it was very well written! 




 You don't offer anyway to justify the message behind the words he said, whereas this article does. It seems as though you are heated by how people interpret his message--maybe he should choose state them a little more clearly. I mean he believes in the bible, but not scientists? Get a grip. Jeb is trying to appease his donors while trying not to piss off half-way intelligent voters.  














 the fact of the matter is that he doesn't attribute climate change to HUMAN ACTIVITY because he isn't sure of "what percentage is man-made and what percentage is natural--it's convoluted"

 thank you so much! 







































 What do you feel, has been one of your greatest/favorite achievements as a United States Senator? 









 awesome idea! 




 yes!! 














































































































































































 lololol 






































































































































 awesome article! 




 I totally agree with you! Precisely the reason I posted the article--Chris Matthews has always downplayed Bernie and it's nice to see that he has stopped that rhetoric (at least for now). Hopefully *now*, he can rightfully acknowledge why Bernie has so much support, even though the rest MSM has yet to recognize it.*^avidly ^waiting* 









 Thank you for being so open and honest! I'm sure that this will help many people out there that have or are struggling with the same thing. :) 




 It is people like you that keeps us loving our jobs, so thank you! 


































 Totally agree, the article doesn't really depict feminist issues--for they are issues that effect everyone 




 Thank you!!!! 





























 I don't even have a Twitter account, but I'll make one for this. :)
