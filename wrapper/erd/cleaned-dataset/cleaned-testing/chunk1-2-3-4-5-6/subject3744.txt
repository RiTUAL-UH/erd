 Youtube and netflix have been giving me all kinds of problems lately. In the last 24 hours they have slowed to a crawl and don't even load. The last year or two i have had the same issues but never this bad. I feel like verizon is trying to piss me off.

This happens with any of my systems including xbox and playstation. I've reset my router, but with my limited knowledge the tracert says it isn't even my end of the network.

 I am a middle of the road kind of person and i think the money involved in politics is mind blowing.

I grew up with grandparents on both sides, my parents vote republican. I don't see things the way they do and i seem to vote the opposite of them.

Edit - i should add that my grandparents weren't communists after reading some of these comments.
 



















 I don't have pictures at the moment, but can take some tomorrow.

While researching what product i should get, i came across [this.](http://www.alphasystemsinc.com/ProductCare) 


 Rubber roof (also known as EPDM) membranes are smooth. TPO and Alpha-Ply roof membranes have a haircel texture, which can be likened to an orange peel.


Was looking at [this product](http://www.epdmcoatings.com/rv-roof-repair.php) and it says 


 For Fleetwood models with ALPHA roofs you will need to use the ProFlex Primer



I'm pretty sure mine is a TPO/Alpha-Ply type roof since it is a Fleetwood and then would need to put down a primer before the rubber coating. The top of the RV is black in color and is not smooth so this makes me think it is not a rubber roof.


This seems the best way to fix it. 

Edit - am back from getting beers 




 Clear your social calendar. We have to cook.

 I was curious what everyone else uses for insulin for their cats. I've been using a bottle of lantus since my vet diagnosed him with diabetes, but it is almost out. The vet said he had ordered it by mistake and would let me have it for $50. When I checked the price for a bottle at the local CVS they want $230.

 I've noticed a few new accounts that have been posting lately in /r/pics and /r/funny and saw a familiar routine with a few of them. Going through the post history of these accounts led me to

/r/usedcarsforsale which is a fairly new sub and if you notice all the posts being made are by user accounts that are only a few weeks old.

if you look at some of the users that post in that sub, you will see that they are trying to post generic photos for exposure and also post the used car ads to the used car sub.

 This is true, i guess a major spoiler can be tagged as such. 




 Yes, exactly that one. I've only been to lagoon half dozen times growing up. They all were themed for ww1 i believe and there was one that was the red baron IIRC. Live out of state but often spent the summers with my cousins. That ride inspired me to become a pilot, i will one day. 




 This was before i found reddit and now i'm stuck here reading shit comments. Never ending cycle.

 OP on youtube [just posted](http://i.imgur.com/psOncPP.png) that she is friends with the owner of the dog.

edit [found a news article](http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20150527/west-loop/dog-walker-caught-on-camera-kicking-puppy-west-loop-building)

The building's security guard, who is stationed at the entrance, noticed the beagle dog was acting odd before they entered the building's elevator, according to the property manager. At that time, the security guard watched a live video feed from the surveillance video located in the elevator on a monitor stationed near the entrance desk.

safe to say it is the right company.

 Black smoke , which it mostly was, is oxygen starved.

Was there black smoke in the OP video? 

I'm not going to argue, got better shit to do. 




 You sound like you don't understand how convection works. Put a shit ton of combustibles in a highrise, air flows up the elevator shafts and supplies a constant flow of oxygen to it. That is how you get such high temperatures. 




 I'll let it slide because of that boner inducing slap sound.

 [This map](http://i.imgur.com/8cSk8ye.jpg) shows it better than i can explain it but it isn't exactly to scale. Mainly has do with geography of the area of the LA basin. The southern most point of the california aqueduct ends at [silverwood lake](https://goo.gl/maps/Xk0Je) which feeds the high desert mainly Hesperia/Victorville. You can see the aqueduct in the top of the google map link.

The colorado aqueduct feeds into [lake Mathews](https://goo.gl/maps/qQgvj) in Riverside. You can't see the aqueduct in the supplied link because it mostly runs underground after it reaches the mountains [around here](https://goo.gl/maps/JwVJF) via the San Jacinto tunnel.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_River_Aqueduct

On the first map i link, i live in that area marked as groundwater to the east of LA. 




 i know what his problem is 




 Was just giving an example of it's location on the east side of the Rockies. Did i say anything about the water level on the google maps link? 




 Why i took the time to explain it without being a dick. I enjoy being able to ask questions in subs meant for other countries about the context. Usually everyone is really nice about it and offers a good explanation. 




  [Strontia Springs Reservoir](https://goo.gl/maps/OYk0i) 

Unfortunately it is on the wrong side of the rockies.
 




 Guy in red (runner) needs be touched by the ball before he touches the 3rd base.  Since Trout was able to touch the base and keep his foot on it before the ball touches him he is considered safe. If there was another runner on second base, the third baseman only needs to touch the base before the runner does.  




 Watched it live and couldn't believe it until like the 3rd replay. 




 Colorado river only feeds SoCal and not much of the LA area, Mainly Riverside and San Diego and parts of San Bernardino. All of the central valley gets its water from the north part of the state. 




 Only time will tell when the wall goes up to divide the rich from the poor. 




 Yes by "old stone" i meant that in the same context that i stated. OP has mentioned countless times on how he wants his landscaping and showed how he wants to enjoy his "Backyard." 

I am happy you used the term "usanians," it should be used more often in this same context. We are all the product of the same experiment. 

edit - wow i sound like a drunk asshole... someone be my friend 




 Do you have any luck with that username? 




 I'm sure it it easier to get rid of old stone in the US compared to some of the older cities with history of those kind of stones in Europe. 




 The stone was ugly as shit, love how your project turned out.

 No shit? If you are aggressive on the way you pursue them it is just going to make them drive even more insane. Exactly what this video shows. He could have tried to keep his distance which at the 4 minute mark he was told to do so but ignored it. Even saying traffic wasn't as bad as it actually is, if you can't safely narrow down a search area after you break off a pursuit, then you don't have enough officers that clearly are needed.

It isn't like the bank robber went in and shot the place up like north hollywood. Once he robs a bank the FBI are involved, no reason to jeopardise my family or your family to capture a guy that can get away with a few thousands dollars only to be captured in a better and easier way later. Why escalate a deadly situation even more by provoking a suspect? Up until the end a single officer was in pursuit of a vehicle and it caused more danger to the public than putting a dangerous bank robber into custody.

edit - I love how you immediately downvote because you disagree

 




 /r/thebox  




 I'm guessing the new one you are talking about is the one in the second link. 




 it's life. 




 Canadian engineer here. Believe it or not, their job page was officially named RIMjobs at one time. /facepalm 




 Am i the only one that thinks the aggressive speeds reached in traffic are more reckless than a bank robber getting away with insured money? If you have to put this many innocent people in danger to get one guy of the street, when should you say protecting the innocent is more important?


Edit - Even at the 4 minute mark the other officer says to disengage the pursuit and the main officer says copy, but continues to pursue when it gets the most dangerous.  




 Prob would if they were in the lower section. 




 I used to install alarms for 10 years, using [this](http://www.xpresskit.com/product.aspx?productid=43) you could do what you want. The original key goes inside the box and gets hidden in the dash, then has a transmitting wire that feeds the unique keyfob up to the cylinder. You can use any kind of metal key after you set this up.

Just realized the first link is discontinued, this is the [newer version](http://www.xpresskit.com/product.aspx?productid=44) of the same product but i have never installed one.

 Went there in elementary school on a field trip, but we just went around and looked at the plants. There was no education that a elementary school kid will remember. 




 Seems to be heading that way, I wouldn't exactly say MTV picked on the kid like /u/Paradiselost541 says. It gives you an insight into his head and try to understand what he thinks. Gives people more context into what someone with a learning disability deals with and can comprehend the world they live in.

 Ex gf had a 17 year old cat that lost her vision suddenly, retinas just suddenly started giving and detached. We got rid of the bedframe to the bed and just put the box spring and mattress on the floor. The cat would sometimes forget about the drop off and walk of the end of the bed until she got used to it. She still knew where the food and litter box was and figured out how to reach the living room. Sometimes running into things getting used to it and where everything was.

 The two recommended to me were [Buffalo Grass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouteloua_dactyloides) or [Zoysia grass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoysia).

Currently most of my lawn is at least 4 different types, Mostly invaded by crabgrass, which  results in [this](http://i.imgur.com/C98MKpw.jpg). After renting an industrial power rake.

My whole lawn has a mixture of permanent shade and sun.

Please help...

edit - i know St Augustine is used around here a lot, will have to use the identification tool to find how what types i have currently, the shaded areas are different type than the ones in the sun. I also need to get rid of the shade that is currently there, the two trees that provide the shade are very old and termite infested. They are on the curbside, and would have to get the city to remove them.

 You can always use a sharp knife to cut underneath it. 




 Ah makes sense then, as long as he has a job in the area it isn't a problem. The 15/91 is a pain in rush hour and i have spent a decent amount of time on both of them. I live in Ontario, when you said IE i thought more like Riverside/MoVal. That can be brutal to your life if you commute to LA or even the OC.

Edit - i worked a service job so it wasn't always from west LA, it was wherever my day ended, some being better than others. At least if it was bad enough i could get a motel room somewhere and be compensated for it. 




 Or finding something not in the same field of your degree and gaining work experience and creating a job history. Doing these will probably further your career than a degree and sitting on the side of the road making people sorry enough for you to give you a job.

 What kind of drill bit is this? I've never seen one with a different kind of metal in the tip of the core. Guessing it is for easy replacing the sharp starting edge of the bit? 




 Watch the video and you will see buildup and not as clean cut. Don't know the magnification on it and if it would be noticeable at all though.

 US heavy bombs are all now gps guided, they don't need to carpet bomb like vietnam anymore. B-52s can hit a separate target with each bomb it has at the same time.

In WW2 the US didn't have precision bombs. Altitude and wind currents would miss targets by miles. That is why whole cities were bombed. The only cities that were bombed were considered industry that supported the Axis,  cities weren't carelessly bombed at random.

 The group was founded in 1949 and grew organically before expanding rapidly through a series of acquisitions in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and was formerly known as the Ratner Group.

Gerald Ratner who built it from 130 stores to 2500, a previous CEO, made possibly the most famous gaffe in twentieth century British business when he explained to a major business conference that the reason why one of his products was so cheap was that it was "total crap". He then went on to unfavourably compare some of the company's earrings with a 99p prawn sandwich. His remarks were gleefully reported by the media, The company lost over 500 million pounds off its share price and consumers subsequently avoided the Ratner branded stores, nearly 300 of which were closed between January 1992 and May 1994 as the group went through a financial restructuring. Ratner resigned in November 1992 and the group changed its name to Signet Group plc in September 1993.

The company moved its primary stock market listing from the London to the New York Stock Exchange on September 11, 2008, changing its name to Signet Jewelers Limited in the process.[4] The firm also moved its country of domicile from the United Kingdom to Bermuda on the same day,[5] although it retains operational headquarters in the Jewellery Quarter, Birmingham.

Company have a bad name? Just rename it and move it to a new location.

Investigators say the man used a cigarette lighter to ignite gas fumes when he got back into his car.

"My initial impression is based on the fact he was at a gas station, it was probably gasoline, we got some samples we took from inside the car and will send out to the state arson lab to see what exactly burned up inside there, said AFD Capt. Andy Reardon.

  I have to say that I liked the other ones better. This was too blatantly political for my taste.

Hopefully they are going to attack both sides in the same way because they are pretty heavy handed. The Mitch McConnell video is the same.

This video is part of the first 3 they made, probably testing the waters on what they can say. The yoga guy was made only yesterday. In the comment section they are asking who they should make one for next. Hopefully they get more neutral as they make more videos.

 Wrote this for a deleted comment to expand on this comment.

 You local gas station pumps don't give you the amount of gas that you paid for, you realize this and report it to the county. They send out the county weight and measurements department and test it. They find out what you say is true. They forward it to the US weight and measurements and now that gas station has to answer to the US government and the county government as well..

 Don't think looking at their own reflection is a good example. Maybe kittens that have never seen a mirror before react to the reflection but that is just their nature running into another cat they don't recognise. I've never had any of my cats after their first experience with a mirror react that way the next time they experience it. My cat Pizza loves to sleep in the bathroom, and most of the time when you come in he will look at you through the mirror. When i start getting close enough to him he will turn his head and look at me directly.

Wasn't there a "Through the wormhole with Morgan Freeman" episode where they were talking about when humans become self conscious? One of the big factors was recognizing themselves in a mirror?
