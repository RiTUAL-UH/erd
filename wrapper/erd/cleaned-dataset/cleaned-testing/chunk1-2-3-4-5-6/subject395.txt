 My dog, Gregory,  does the head tilt.   Bruce is kind of a weird one.   Perhaps he was a dog in another life.  His favorite thing to do is play fetch with this random ceiling fan chain.  Only that chain though.  He will run for it and bring it back compulsively.  Adorable. 
























 So, I made it!  I can definitely feel the difference.  I think I feel that no-nicotine-fog lifting.  I am going to revisit origami to help with the tactile aspect. 









 Has Hyperspace been mentioned?  Or Snuff Box.  Yay!  Freakin' love British TV.

 Best.  Ever.
