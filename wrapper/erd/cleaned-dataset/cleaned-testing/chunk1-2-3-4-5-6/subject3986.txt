 Thanks for reminding me! I forgot to put my NYX eyeliner in my product list haha. i have tried filling my brows in countless times, but the brow pencil I get is either too light or too dark :-/ 

I will look into the eyebrow pomade you suggested in hopes that my eyebrows will look more even. Thank you so much! 




 Products used-

Primer: TwoFaced Primed and Poreless

Foundation: iT Cosmetics Celebration Foundation

Lips: Burts Bees lip crayon in Hawaiian Smoulder

Eyeliner: NYX liquid liner 









 Urban Decay Vice palette please 




 iT cosmetics celebration foundation! How well does it conceal blemishes and dark circles? I've watched various YouTube reviews but none of the reviewers have bad skin like mine. Is it worth the buy?  




 I seem to look "too washed out" at school every day. I usually do just a winged liner and a slightly tinted lip balm. I've noticed that when I wear red lipstick I pop out more, but still I look very plain. Are there any suggestions anyone can give me to stand out more? Any criticism is welcome! 




 If we do adhere to the banshee theory, in certain cultures banshees are know as harbringers of death. Meaning: Their screams tell you when someone is going to die. I would be very careful, they might be trying to warn you, and since you happened to have a warped engine you could have gotten into a serious accident. Watch out OP! 




 I'm from Cary and I remember hearing this!! I was only about 11 or 12 but it scared me so bad I didnt go to sleepovers. I'm sorry for your loss though :( 




 He showed up at school on valentines day with a 6ft stuffed rabbit, sang me a song asking me to prom and offered to pay for my ticket, dress and any accessories I wanted. I thought he was just trying to be kind, and at prom I introduced him to my friends as "just a friend". Little did I know he harbors a ginormous crush on me and I was too oblivious to realize it until the summer when he moved away  




 My dad told me this story as I left for a summer camp that would be held in UNC Chapel Hill's dorms. He told me when he attended university he had three suitemates. One of them was never around as he took night classes. The other was my dads close friend and the fourth guy (Mike) was an ROTC nut. So the say the suites are set up is that there's French doors separating each suite and the French doors had giant windows which people usually covered with curtains or posters. So mike was OBSESSED with pushing the red button on a nuclear submarine so he could start a war, and he constantly told his suitemates this. He also got drunk every Friday night and went out to fight with black people, and this made my dad and his suitemates to never want to talk to the guy. One night Mike comes home wasted and bloody after a night of fighting and my dads like "k cool whatever". My dad goes to his room to study and out of nowhere Mike's hands punch through the window and grab my dad. He takes his lamp and throws it at mike and runs out into the hallway where a VERY intoxicated Mike then calls my (hispanic) dad a "filthy nigger" and tell him how he's going to "gut him like a fish". My dad bangs on the RA's door and begs him to let him in. The RA then calls campus police, and I shit you not, it took FOUR cops to hold him down. My dad said mike went to a mental institution the rest of the semester and when he came back he had totally forgotten (or pretended to forget) that he tried to kill my dad. What a great way to start off freshman year!

 It legit made me cry and shake with anger. I feel so bad for the fathers friend. 




 Also, in Japan everyone is Japanese. I have been here as an exchange student for 5 months and the only foreigners besides my fellow classmates are the occasional tourist. 




 Kyoto, Japan 




 That people with eating disorders are "tragically thin" and will remain beautiful throughout their disease. Thats not true at all. You won't be beautiful when your skin, nails and teeth turn yellow from malnutrition and you wont be pretty when you lose clumps of hair and basically shrivel up into a brittle shell of the person you used to be. Oh, and eating disorders do not only affect women, but men as well. Awareness is the only way to end the cycle. Love yourself and your body.  




 When will you know what you want to do as a profession? I have to apply for college in a few months and I dont know what I want to major in and what field of work I want to work in and the uncertainty makes me so anxious 




 Snapbacks, sagging backs, air jordans and a vocabulary that consists of "swag!" and "YOLO!"

 My city is the home of the KKK, isn't that just lovely 




 I was so relieved that someone told me, and in English no less. Its been weird not seeing many foreigners in Kyoto except in the touristy areas. So far my stay has been amazing despite the incident but my host program not requires every participant to go sightseeing with an adult (before we could do whatever we want as long as it followed our families rules and the counties rules). Needless to say although my classmates were spooked by this, they're a little peeved as well, but are glad I am safe. Thanks for the wishes though! 




 Yeah I brushed it off initially because it was at Kinkaku-ji temple, and if you look it up you will see it is visually striking. So I thought to myself "ah, I'm standing in a good area, he just wants good pictures like me!" I was very very wrong. 




 Oh yeah, I've gotten SO many high school students asking to take pictures with me and I find it quite funny. But this just...this creeps me the hell out. 




 To give some background information let me first start off by saying this has left me constantly looking over my shoulder. 

This June i travelled abroad with an exchange program in Japan where i would be a host student and study at a local highschool for 8 weeks. My host family had taken me to the sights in Kyoto and Osaka but there were a few places we hadn't gone yet. On Saturday we decided to go to a famous temple in the area and only me and my host father went since my host sister was at volleyball practice. My host fathers hobby is photography so he brought his DSLR camera and a bunch of lenses so we could get the best shots possible. We arrived at the temple and there was a good mix of Japanese and gaijins (for those of you who dont know, a gaijin is a foreigner). We proceeded to buy our tickets and enter the temple and my host father whipped out his camera and started to take pictures of the landscape and candids of me as well. 

Pretty soon i realized people were staring at me and i paid no attention to it since it looked a bit strange for an American girl to be walking with a Japanese man. I brushed off the weird glances as i was captured by the temples beauty! As i was taking pictures on my phone, an english man next to me taps my shoulder discreetly and says "there is a man following you taking pictures of you miss, be careful"
I laugh and tell the man that it is only my host father who is taking pictures and the man turns ashen in the face and says "no, not him, the man is BEHIND your host father. He has been taking pictures of you the whole time while neither of you are looking!" 

At this point m heart begins to race and as i turn around i see none other than a short, chubby, asian man holding a digital camera- thats pointed right at me! I act nonchalant and walk to my host father and try to explain the situation but my japanese is not advanced enough to give him the full story. The only thing i can muster out is "chikan" (pervert in japanese) and point discreetly to the man following me. My host dad, who is a whopping 6'2 man, walks over to the creepy guy and converses with him in japanese and gets him to hand over the camera then runs for his life to the temple exit. Much to my surprise the SD card is full of pictures of ONLY me, and they progressively get more creepy. There was even a picture that he somehow snuck from under my skirt which i didnt even notice.

 We contacted the temple's security and the local police and they are investigating and promise to return with more information. Although there was no harm done to me i feel constantly paranoid that now everyone is taking pictures of me or that i will somehow see this man again on the train or bus and that this time he won't settle for pictures up my skirt... 
























 Wow that color looks so good on you! My only recommendation is to make sure to either line your lips with pink liner or to use a concealed pen to outline your lips so the lipstick doesn't run, because its really noticeable when bright colored lipstick is getting a bit messy  




 Super late to ask, but do you find writing with a pencil/pen hard to do?  




 If you have an instagram check out cosplayer Chloe Dykstra's instagram (@chloedykstra)! She did this AWESOME makeup for Lisa Frank about a month ago, like it was spot on!

 Hopefully mermaid will be a good substitute for kitties 3 

And welcome fellow newbie! 




 Ooh hello there! :) I think all us girls had the dreaded raccoon phase... I went through the emo phase and thought "YES MORE EYELINER IT SHOULD BE AS BLACK AS MY SOUL" but now I deeply regret that decision  




 IT is well worth the price! Honestly it covers so well I dont need concealer, but you have to buff well so the foundation doesn't appear cakey.

And about Coldstone, its just the way they're run, but mine doesn't require you to sing unless someone asks :P we're lazy! 

I cant believe youre a cosplayer, its do rare to find them!!! I've done Taiga Aisaka from Toradora! Yin from Darker than Black, Harley Quinn, and im working on a Poison Ivy now that I got my awesome green lipstick from Melt Cosmetics 3 




 I know, but it helps boredom when youre at school

 (   )  




 Well I have some Revlon colorstay that fits my budget, but for Christmas I have asked for an Urban Decay palette. I really really really want Vice3 but I have also heard that Naked2 is way better. I'm open to any palettes, really. I just want something super fun! 




 Thanks for the welcome! Where did you used to live? I currently live in North Carolina. 




 I'm an IT Cosmetics ADDICT! seriously! I have oily, sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts and I find that it really helps with coverage and doesn't gunk up my pores. 

As for hobbies, I'm pretty boring. I work at Coldstone Creamery and I like to cosplay whenever there's a convention, but other than that High school keeps me busy :( 




 Hey ya'll! I'm a southern girl who loves nothing but lipstick and a fierce winged liner. I've just started to experiment with eyeshadow as I'm only 17, and I really hope to improve my makeup skills. I always been fascinated with makeup (even though my middle school makeup made me look like a raccoon *cringe*) and I'm so eager to learn more tricks of the trade :)  




 For Christmas I'm asking for an Urban Decay eyeshadow palette. I've had my eyes on Vice3 for a looooong time, but I'm not sure sure its worth it. So MU addicts.... Whats your favorite and why? 




 I'd recommend Benefit's mascara They're Real!

Not only is it long lasting, but it also volumizes and lengthens your lashes the more you wear it :) 




 Me! I live near Raleigh in the Apex area :) 














 This is amazing! 




 Good idea, thank you so much for the advice! I have a somewhat similar concealer pencil by IT cosmetics and when I get Blow ill try out your tip 




 I love love love Blow! I just purchased it, but now I have no clue what to use as a lip liner. Do you have any suggestions? 




 Is Urban Decays "Vice" palette worth the buy? 




 Good job on the first haul! And I need to say that your cheeckbones are perfect! 




 Thank you so much! I usually do red lips and plain eye or winged liner and natural lips. You rock! 
























 Haha its my highschool senior picture for the yearbook :) 









 ive had my blonde since my 9th grade year, and now im a 12th grader. i really dont want to part with it when i have to get a job.... :( 




 Grouch Marx mustache = her eyebrows 




 New pictures are up :) 









 im working on it :) the holiday season keeps me busy at work!

EDIT: The new pictures are up!  




 My "long side" of the haircut was maybe up to my collarbone when i first got it, and i HATED it so much, but i too my moms advice and let it grow out and im soooo glad i did! 




 our routine is almost identical! but my main question is: do you use liquid or powder foundation? i use powder, so i hope that if i apply concealer on top it wont look cakey.  




 the glamoflauge Lite comes in na double ended crayon, so i apply the lighter concealer first and then the darker/peachier shade to conceal even more. i then blend the corners with a blending sponge, but i find that my problem area (dark circles) arent concealed as well as i had hoped 




 Army strong  




 Oh my goodness I used to get that ALL the time! My freshman year of highschool my hair was long and burgundy and everyone would tell me that!! And thanks so much :)  




 I'm not sure its a joke... She was pretty instagram famous (~4k followers) but half of then were haters telling her that her brows looked terrible. So now she's going "all natural" and combing her brow hairs upwards so they look all furry. I dont think she understands that her new trend isn't helping her... 









 I decided to cave in and buy Hard Candy's Glamoflauge Lite concealer because i ran out of IT cosmetics bye-bye under eye. I tried it out today and i saw no visible change for my extremely dark circles under my eyes. I read up on MUA that it would work better if i applied above my foundation, but i wear powder so i dont know if that will work... Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get the best coverage out of Glamoflauge? Because i really want it to work!  




 [srs] she actually reposted it. she took more pictures, but in the original she did some artsy angle where you couldnt even see the pink eyeshadow, and even in the repost you can barely see it.... 









 My favorite color is dark green! Its enchanting and reminds me of a Forest and contrasts well with my skin tone. My favorite shade is Melt cosmetics Blow! Seriously, its gorgeous

Pantone 




 Do you know if the gamepiece comes with UD orders from Ulta? I ordered a butt ton of UD products for cyber Monday so I'm just wondering if its possible to get ome 




 I have been dying to get my hands on the Limecrime Venus palette, and I even signed up for email alerts for when its back in stock...m but I cant justify buying a $50 eye shadow when I could probably find dupes for $20. Its the packaging that makes mw want it :( 




 Name it "Afteryu" and when people ask "hey, what did you name your boat?" you can reply "afteryu", and the people will automatically be flattered that you named the boat after them, but when they see the name of the boat they will feel like idiots 




 Definitely the Real Techniques kits! They're pretty in expensive for the quality as well 




 A few weeks ago I received CC that I should try to fill in my brows more and to try out a more "dewy" look. I took the advice, so what do you think?

Products used

Primer: TwoFaced Primed and Poreless

Concealer: IT Cosmetics Bye-Bye Undereye

 ah, another fellow raccoon eyed eighth grader :) i looked like a crossover between someone from My Chemical Romance and someone punched in both eyes. i wish i knew to not put dark purple eyeshadow all over my eyelid and under my waterline, but i thought i was "edgy" hahah 




 [srs] i mean she spent hundreds on the knockoffs to review them for people who cant afford a $58 UD palette. it was no different  then all the regular hauls and swatches MUA users post with their brand-name items. it was just a silly thing for people to get mad about...  




 Dang, you were SO close! North Carolina ;) 




 ARE YOU SAYING IM NOT ALREADY HIGH END???? I AM FLAWLESS, BITCH! 




 Ur harassing me! Downvote 




 Oh that makes sense! Thanks for explaining :) 




 I just ordered Lolita because you rocked it so hard!! Just out of curiosity, why are you holding a blank sheet of paper in one of the last pictures? I've seen it a couple times but I never really understood what it does 




 My music tempo affects how fast I work! If I'm listening to 2cellos (cello covers of rock songs) I work much slower, but if I listen to metal then I'm lightning quick  




 Oh my god Bang! Bang! is gorgeous but would not look good with my skin tone. So jealous! 




 Really? I have only seen spacecake once, but I guess since I'm not always on reddit I may miss the posts 









 The Borgias! I've never been interested in historical drama but this show takes the cake. Its amazing! Make sure you watch the one with Jeremy Irons (the voice of Scar from the Lion King) 




 Wow I wish I looked like you when I was 14! I was rocking the raccoon eyeliner and concealer as foundation look... I think a nice bold winged liner could really draw attention to your eyes. Also, if youre a beginner with eye shadow, just find a nice pink shade that looks feminine (not hot pink or anything hahah) and dab that on the lid for a "fresh" look, then apply winged liner. Its good for someone your age and not too over-the-top! 




 Your brows have a nice shape but they seem really thin... I would recommend looking into filling them in to give you a "fuller", more natural look. 




 Love the look, but as /u/boppitybeepboop said, just blend a bit more. And I really need to go buy one of those burts bees lip crayons! 




 Maybe its just me but I rarely ever see anyone do swatches/hauls/FOTD with a Melt Cosmetics product. I have two of their lipsticks in Blow and DGAF and they're gorgeous and perfect for the price! But I have barely seen anyone on MUA review them, which is weird because id expect Melt to be raved over because of the quality and price... 




 I listen to music and sing my little heart out! Then when I have to do my eyeliner its as quiet as a library for maximum concentration haha 




 Nah guys. She was 100% serious. Like she posted picture of her and her "besties!!!!!!!!" at school. I would be mortified for LIFE.  




 Yep! Thats what I have. Its the only Hard Candy product my store carries. There's a WalMart an hour away but I dont think its worth it for some concealer.  




 I would, but I plan on being a diplomatic translator, so ill have to enjoy the wacky hairstyles while I can~ 




 Wow! Thanks! It actually was very helpful, this was what I was thinking of :)  




 Judging by the angle their sloping at, I reckon they'll slide off her forehead any minute now... 




 Well... long story short... her 4,000 instagram followers told her she looked hideous so then she decided to go for an "editorial" look and she grew out her eyebrows and brushed the hairs upwards, which looks even sillier. So the answer is no. 




 I have medium beige skin with a slight olive undertone, and I'm really lusting over Coven but I'm not sure I could pull it off with my complexion. Could anyone with a similar skin tone comment with some swatches or with you wearing Coven so I can an idea?
 
























 IT Cosmetics celebration foundation is cruelty free! its a nice matte that looks flawless if you can buff it correctly

also, if youre willing to pay $$$ for a lip product i'd recommend either Melt Cosmetics or the new ABH liquid lipsticks :)

that bass tho 




 [srs] dude, we have a mutual follower! and i love your username, if it refers to the band! 









 [srs] met chloe at a cosplay convention and she is one of the nicest people ever, not gonna lie. she gave compliments and tips to all the fans she met and seemed pretty down to earth.  i do think she oversexualizes cartoon/movie/comic book characters, but hey, its cosplay.  





























 Wow thank you SO much! I just started getting into SFX makeup so your comment made me grin like a fool :D 














 Your foundation is too light. Maybe its the because its the lighting but it looks one/two shades too light. Try getting new foundation and having an associate help match the color! 




 Ive never used blush because I'm afraid my skin is too dark (NC40) but i really want to check this line out.... is it limited edition? Or will MAC be selling it for a while?  




 Dear Zachary

hands-down bet documentary ever. it was such an emotional rollercoaster 




 I'm not 21 so ill see if i can arrange something for the beer (I live near a family owned brewery) and ill look into NC candies!  




 ah sorry, thought it was a NC thing. i've never seen it anywhere else 




 i was thinking Cheerwine. Is that big in flordia? 




 Youre the best! its a japanese drink, and heres what it looks like http://upload.lsforum.net/users/public/i41908img836-2j104.jpg (sorry for the formatting, im on mobile)

i can send some soft drinks from my state that you cant find outside of the south, if youre willing to exchange!  




 PLEASE tell me they carry CC Lemon! ive been looking for that stuff for months but the one asian market near me doesnt carry Japanese snacks :( 




 I've posted a couple times in this sub and I have ALMOST hit the pan on on my IT Cosmetics Celebration Foundation powder foundation. 

I'm currently looking for a new foundation to try out, but I dont really want to wear powder again. I feel like the coverage is too light to cover up all my flaws and it flakes when I use concealer.

Are there any foundations that are dont appear too oily and wont make drive my face demons insane?  




 What products would you recommend for someone with oily acne-prone skin? I've tried products from pr and IT cosmetics but they only make my face look cakey :/ 




 AM: I wash my face with Philosophy Purity and dab on a little moisturizer before priming (I have a very oily face) 

PM: I use an oil based makeup remover for the eyes, the Philosophy Purity Clear gel (it removes makeup) mixed with an exfoliant and then I use with hazel and then add moisturizer before bed

I've had bad acne since I was 11 and now that I'm 17 my skin has improved but the pores around my nose are atrocious 









 Heres my favorite cosplay! I was Taiga Aisaka from ToraDora! http://i.imgur.com/LJukuk2.jpg 




 I'd link you to the website but im on mobile. Its basically 4 hours of him demonstrating how HE does his beauty routine (priming face, applying foundation, false lashes, etc) and its also a laid back Q A session as well. You also get a goodie bag of his products as a gift for participating  




 Hey ya'll! Im curious if any of you guys have gone to Jeffree Stars showcase "tour"? Im very interested but I dont know if its worth the $140...

So...advice, anyone? 




 They live in Kyoto, but its a host grandmother who is fairly old, and a host dad. I love them to death but they're not exactly in the loop with stuff hahaha. 

That would be AMAZING if we could work something out! I'll send back some Cheerwine, which is North Carolinas specialty drink, if youre interested! 




 There aren't many Asian grocers in NC and the one near me doesn't carry Japanese food :( I tried to get my host family to send me some but they keep saying they are unfamiliar with the soda 




 Sadly I live on the east coast and there is only one Asian grocery store but they specialize in chinese/vietnamese food 




 Hi there! I'm willing to trade any treat or snack from the US for a Japanese drink called "CC Lemon" and a gum called "Acuo" 

Please help a girl out! 




 if youre up for a bold lip, i'd go for Anastasia Beverly Hills liquid lipstick in Carina! its such a bright pink but not too overpowering :)

But if you dont want to pay alot, I'd suggest Colour Pop Lippie Stix in Cheers
