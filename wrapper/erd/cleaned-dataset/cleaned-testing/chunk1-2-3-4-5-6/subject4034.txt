 Heard it has a bit of a chlorine after taste.   









 Go to the post office to get money out, you can get absolutely any amount out and they don't charge you a withdrawal fee like the ATM's there if you're not with that bank.   




 The pizzas are pretty decent as well.  




 I highly recommend De Bortoli. They have a really good range and their staff is pretty awesome.  




 The Warner's Bay place is Hunter Valley Martial Arts. They do BJj I think 3ish classes a week but they get an instructor down from Sydney who is very good. Did that a little bit and it was really good.  




 You can always check out the brewery.  Plenty of stuff going on there.   




 As someone who works in charlestown square I'm Damn happy it was shut. But the 27th was nuts.  
























 I kind of hoped she would. Would be more interesting than the lecture.  All I could gather was that I could pat an elephant and would be yelled at.   




 That is an amazing photo.  Great work.  




 Did you guys get hit with the overly excited Student Travelling people about going on a safari or something.  
Had about 3 of them in different lectures yelling about how good it is.   




 I'm thinking on doing a Red vs Blue viewing and hangout sort of a thing but am wondering is there are any fans in Newy? 




 Good call, you have my follow.   




 Just behind the ferry port on the Newcastle side at the brewery has had some seriously good results.   




 Internet  




 What do you do?  
























 Is that a chunk error or did you hollow that out?  




 Youtube it but basically humans try to survive while the zombies try and catch the humans to make them zombies. 
Cool part is humans hold the zombies off using nerf guns and rolled up socks.  




 I remember a couple of years ago that there was the possibility of a game of Humans vs Zombies to be played at Newcastle Uni.  I seriously want this to be a thing and would love to get it running.  Anyone keen? 




 Clothing Optional  




 Failing that there is always wiziwig.com which will stream all the games.  




 Final year IT student  




 It stands for Red Vs Blue. It is a Web series made entirely using Halo by a company called Rooster teeth. Really funny show, they have 11 seasons out with a 12th on the way.  




 Holy crap yes!!  
























 Hey thanks heaps for getting back to me. 
What goes on on the Sunday classes?  




 I really want to start training in Parkour, great exercise and what not. Is there much of a scene in Newy or a group or  others keen to give it a crack? 




 Does anyone know of any uni sharehouses Here? Preferably near Macquarie Uni? 




 Would anyone out there happen to know of any web development or Web design companies in New that are looking an intern or work or anything like that. 




 That is brilliant  









 Yeah its a really great place. They don't have the range that Kings have but whatever they don't have they happily order for you and it gets here pretty quickly. 
And the Owner is a bloke named James and he is super talkative but a really nice guy.  





























 Hyrule castle is always a fun build.  




 The new Transformers. Absolutely horrible film.  




 Oh that's what you did. I just thought you weren't happy with their service. I get it now. 
You are damn clever.  




 I see what you did there.  




 That is a great idea. Possible character could be Snowden as well. He could even voice act it. He's not going anywhere.  














 All of that sounds like something I would be interested in so I will definitely register and get along to the First Timers 
  
























 The Apple Store at Charlestown....... Hahahahaha  




 Bit of column A, bit of column B  




 There's a few weeks of interviews and about a month or training and.  




 Max Brenner at Charlestown are always hiring. They have a bit of a staff rotation.  




 Hey as a heads up there is a Newcastle audition For top model at Charlestown Square today at 3. Jen Hawkins Is there so well apparently. 

So if you like top model or pretty women  then that's going on. 

Just a heads up. 




 Carefully is very correct. They use normal moving equipment but they normally pad the hell out of when the chain or rope attaches to the artefact.  




 You don't get that kind of advertising any more  




 Look up a picture of hyrule castle plus a few inside pictures. 

Then, you know, build the thing.
