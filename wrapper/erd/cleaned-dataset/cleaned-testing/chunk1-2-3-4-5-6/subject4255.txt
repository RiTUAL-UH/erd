 Hey everyone, instead of *just* downvoting a post could you please add a comment as to why? Maybe it's not that healthy, maybe it's not that cheap. Give us some context! Only you can improve quality and that starts with not just a downvote, but a reason as well. I'd like to know how to improve the subreddit.

 Hello,

I just switched from an iPhone 4 to an iPhone 5 a couple of days ago. I've been having issues logging into the app. I have cleared the login sharing and cache, deleted my account and then re added it with no luck. I've even tried uninstalling then reinstalling the app. Any ideas?

 So I bought a couple of bags of fresh cranberries at the market yesterday. I get home, pop some in my mouth and almost hurled at the taste of the wretched things. They were so tart! I had no idea! 

Anyhow, I want to make something healthy with them (low in carbs) and was looking for some recipes. 

Thank you in advance. 




 Everytime I buy a certain cheese flavored chip, I am always curious as to the addition of MSG. I know it's supposed to make food taste better but I've never had that chip without it. 

Same goes for any product you've tried that was MSG free.  














 Look, I've tried donotcall.gov, I've tried being nice and telling them to please remove my number from their list. But they're adapting... Like this:

I'll get calls from numbers all over the country, when I pick up they hang up on me. I would ignore them but if I don't pick up they'll call me 4-5 times a day. Just yesterday I picked up and didn't say anything and I could hear a guy speaking Farsi. As soon as I said hello he hung up on me. If I call them back then it'll take me to a rep and when I ask them to remove me from their list they just hang up on me. 

I would love to scare the shit out of them or take legal action. It kinda freaks me out when I answer and get hung up on. Can anyone help me?

**Now the problem:**    

Just recently (within the last week) I would turn my PC on and it would load to the login screen. After I entering the password it would load the desktop and after about 10 seconds my mouse would freeze, my keyboard would be unresponsive and then the video would cut out. Every now and then after doing this my PC would restart but would meet the same doom. **This is a list of the things I tried to fix it:**  


* Draining the power after the PSU is unplugged  
* Reseating the RAM  
* Reseating the GPU  
* Resetting the BIOS (by removing the little round battery)  
* [Following these directions to make sure I'm not a crazy person](http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/261145-31-perform-steps-posting-post-boot-video-problems)  

Anyhow, it's a new build (been working fine for about 4 months). 








































































































 You people loved the shit out of "Let Nas Down" by J. Cole. I love that shit too. I love the shit out of it. But all be damned. I post a link to NAS' FUCKING RESPONSE and you look the other way? J COLE WAS INSPIRED BY NAS (you'd know that by listening to "Let Nas Down") because Nas is a lyrical master. When J. Cole made that first album and became a bubble gum rapper, NAS SAID "Hey man! What the fuck!? You're better than that shit dude."  

J. Cole was obviously upset that his idol criticized him so he poured his heart and soul into [Born Sinner](http://open.spotify.com/album/1NfrmcXk8xNennyxQ57JcW) and especially that one fucking song you people liked ([Let Nas Down](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLF39513uwM)).

Well guess the fuck what? Nas heard the damn song, took the beat and intro and made a fucking response out of it. JESUS CHRIST. IS THAT NOT THE MOST BADASS THING YOU'VE EVER FUCKING HEARD? I'm not going to spoil the damn song for you all. It's worth a listen. 

"But but... it's rap" -asshole 
"Shut the fuck up and open your damn mind fool" - me  

"But it's 3 minutes long." -asshole
"Are you fucking kidding me? You spend more than three minutes jerking off getting the same euphoria that this 3 minutes will bring your bitch ass." - me  

"But your words... they hurt my feelings." -asshole
"Grow the fuck up you little bitch. Life hurts. Cry a river, build a bridge, get the fuck over it and listen to the goddamn song or so help me I will find you and implant a goddamn chip into your head that loops 'Banana Phone' into your mind nonstop. The only thing that'll make it stop is you getting over your hypocritical mentality and listening to the goddamn song." - me


[LISTEN TO IT SHIT FUCK CHRIST CROSS BITCH NIGGA.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgcAPrmz4zg)  

And if you've already listened to it and are like "Dude, chill the fuck out. I loved that shit too." then good for you. Let's eat crumpets some time. 


Also, discuss your thoughts on both songs.

You know how it went on sale 2 days ago? Well this whole damn time I've owned the game I have just assumed I've had it. Until last night.

I play mulitplayer with some friends of mine and I try and join their game only to find out I don't actually have it and now it's $30 (a little ridiculous for a DLC if you ask me). If you have an extra copy from a bundle, i'd appreciate it.

I'll even draw something in mspaint for you if you comment (you don't have to give me the game for me to draw.) 




 One of you fine people posted a couple weeks ago about this site called usertesting.com.

I sign up and took a practice test (which paid out $10), got a 5 star rating and haven't really received a test since. I mean, you get screened for most of them (which, so far, has led me to 0 successes). 

Do you have any tips or tricks on getting new tests? I mean shit, I'd love the extra work but it is so damn picky. Should I just lie or something? I'd hate to do that. 




 Open to accounts older than 2 months.

To enter:

1. Comment with the game you'd like  
2. In mspaint, draw me your best interpretation of what the word "flargepool" is/means

 




 All I wanted was Crusader Kings 2 (can't beat the price, it's $24 on sale and humblebundle but $6.74 with the jumbo bundle)

* Deadlight
* The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing - Complete Pack
* Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition
* Terraria
* THE KING OF FIGHTERS XIII STEAM EDITION
* Legend of Grimrock
* Orcs Must Die! 2: Complete Pack
* PixelJunk Eden


RULES:   
1. I will only gift games to people that **have not received**.   
2. Your account **MUST** be at least 2 months old and have at least 35 comment karma (none of these sit-and-wait accounts)  
3. **DO NOT PM ME.**   

**To Enter:**  

You must comment with the game you want (1 game per user), your steam ID, and your best mspaint drawn interpretation of what it means to be a "cattyflanger"

Winners will be picked in 24 hours.


Edit: Guys, I fucked up. I'll be passing out the games still but I won't make it in my 24 hr period. For this error if you read this, edit your post with another game and I'll give out 2 per winner.

 Hello all, I hope I'm in the right place.  

My yard has a bad chigger problem. If any of us or our animals go out, we get eaten alive. I've been researching non-pesticidal ways to remove them from our yard and have come up with two safe tactics.

1. Nematodes
2. Sulfur  

My problem is, I'd like to rid them while spending the least amount of cash.  

Nematodes work well, I hear, but they are pretty expensive and require a special hose hookup to apply.  

Sulfur is cheap but I'm curious if it will affect my yard's ecosystem in a harmful way. I know it smells (that's not an issue for me) but would that smell keep birds away? What about bees? I'd hate to shoo bees away because of the chiggers. Would it negatively affect my dog?  

Any help would be appreciated.

 Hello everyone! I have an office birthday celebration this friday and the cuisine is "anything salad." I want to bring a keto-heavy salad but am not sure what would go well together. 

Could you help me out? It doesn't have to be limited to your typical leaf salads, keto variants of pasta salads, chicken/tuna salads would work as well.

 I walked into a bathroom and heard this weird noise coming from the stall next to the one I was entering. It was kind of like a small popping noise.

Anyhow, I sit down to take the browns to the superb owl. I pinch a couple of loaves and realize that there is no toilet paper in my stall. Shit! 

I didn't want to walk out with my ass covered in dookie so I asked the man in the stall next to me if he could spare some squares. He shuffles real quick and hands me a wadded up tp bunch with warm liquid on it.

I smelt it (you would too) and it was totes jizz.


TL;DR. Wiped my ass with a jizz soaked TP square.

 This is the second time I've tried it and I keep getting sick. I read about the keto flu but this isn't it. My tonsils have swollen up so bad that my throat is now the size of a quarter.

 At work we have [wall-mounted lock box](http://imgur.com/UEUElTj) where we store keys. It's always been open but yesterday I bumped up against it and closed it. Now it's locked shut and nobody knows the combination.

It's not your typical [multiple-dial lock](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Combination_discs.png), I've looked up youtube guides that tell people to look for markings under the turning dials and it doesn't have that. What I do see is [THIS](http://imgur.com/m3MtVjw). There is a flat surface on the cylinder below all three of the dials. I've tried lining them up facing me with no luck, I tried using the opposite number as well with no luck. I'm not even sure if that's the way I should be going in order to open it.

I need help opening this lock. Any help would be appreciated.

 Hello Gracious Community!

I've recently decided to acquire a road bike and I've got some helpful tips from users on where to find a great selection of used ones under $200 (120.53 pounds, 145.36 euro). Below is a list of links of bikes that I thought looked great. Do you mind giving your two cents on which one would be the best purchase or advice on what a good deal looks like?

Here are some specs as to my body type:

I'm 5ft 8in (172.72cm)  
I weigh 195lbs (88.4505kg)


Also, if you see one that's not worth the price listed, feel free to give me an amount and I'll ask the seller! 

I very much appreciate your assistance. Thank you for the support/help! 









 Hello community!

I have a low-end mountain bike. I bought it used for $25. The only big issue I have with it is the handlebar keeps coming loose! I've tried tightening the bolt and ended up stripping it. I have a new bolt and it's not working to well either. Do you have any recommendations on how to keep it secure? Maybe a trick? 

Also, where is the best place to find used sports bikes? Like the majority of the ones on the front page. I really like their design, the thinner wheels, and the two-placement handlebars. They also look like they're a little lighter than mine. But they're expensive new! 

Thank you so much for your help! 



















 I have quite a few mods I'm interested in using but once I install them (using KSP Mod Admin) and start the game, the loader will run until it hits the middle and then just stop.

Do not forget to provide your Steam ID. Please refrain from requesting if you have already received something from GoG. I know how disappointing it is to submit to countless offers and come up with  nothing, so I'd like to give only the underdogs a chance. 


EDIT FOR ALL:

User /u/lumenation has informed me of this info:

**If you have Sims 3 on steam and try to buy expansions from stores or from Origin, they will not pair with the Sims 3 on steam. Only expac's bought on steam will work with Sims 3.  

However you can use the steam Sims 3 key on origin and any expec's bought on steam with origin as well.
If you knew this or not I just thought I'd let you know so you can inform others. I had issues with this when I originally had Sims 3 on my steam.**

 I went to the doctor recently to get some blood work done. They said that my TSH was running high and that my thryroid isn't producing enough of the hormone. She wants me to start taking levothyroxine. However, I'm scared. What if there is an underlying cause of this occurrence? My family does not have a history of thyroid issues and I had blood work done last year with no thyroid issues (that I know of). I'm scared that if I start taking the supplement that if it's another issue that hasn't been diagnosed and is treatable, that I will eventually become dependant on the medication and my thyroid will stop producing hormones all together. Am I making sense? What can I do? 




 Am I correct in saying that she was once a man? I know that's probably a dumb question. She just looks so much like a woman! Except with a dick. Anyhow, I saw this presentation on shemales and how men get turned on by them. But gay men aren't. It's weird how our brains work. Something called an erotic illusion. Here's the talk: http://youtu.be/p-A8GvUehq4?t=21m35s. 




 I used to hate Yishan, until the thought police seized me. They beat me day in and day out. They deprived me of food, water, and shelter. They made me watch hours upon hours of reality TV (Jersey Shore, Teen Mom, and The Real Housewives of Atlanta) while crushing my ball-sack with a pair of vice grips. They inserted 2-4lb pineapples in most of my orifices and then forced me to eat the fruit. This went on for months.

That is... until Yishan saved me. He came and stopped the torment and he promised me that I would one day come to love him. 

Today is that day, my brothers. He is lov...

 Thanks! I overclocked it to 4.1Ghz but mulitplayer hasn't changed much. I think the highest I can clock it is 4.2, I might try that! 




 Yep! I just upped mine to 4.1ghz and the game is running better! 




 Can you recommend any MP servers that aren't shitty? 




 Well, maybe when I get a higher paying job I'll switch over to an Intel CPU and MOBO.

 Actually, I do have the ability to overclock it and it's water cooled so I believe it can happen!

I've had to turn the graphics down extremely low which makes the game very ugly! It's a beautiful game! I want to experience is in its glory.  

Anyhow, I've come to the conclusion that it's my GPU (Radeon 6870) and I'm looking to purchase a new one (can be a refurbished or used one). One that can handle Arma 3 at (hopefully) max settings. I also don't want to spend a fortune. I'd like to spend at max $240.  

What types of GPUs do you all use to run it at high settings? Any ideas or paths would be greatly appreciated.   


Also: I get rekt in every firefight I encounter, I can't turn fast enough...  




 I love that place! MT is awesome.

Unfortunately I moved to Dallas. I miss my curry. 




 Thanks smilebot. :) 




 Perhaps there is a difference but perhaps not. Everywhere else I've been has a much lighter panang curry, it doesn't look slow cooked from what I can tell. It's not that deep dark red. Makes me sad :(. I just purchased some panang curry paste off of amazon and I'm going to try and make your recipe when it comes in. Man, but nothing beats Madam Mam's panang curry. I could eat it every meal. 




 I wish it was that simple. 




 Awesome! Thank you for the explanation! 




 Lock-out? Tag-out?  




 I don't get it, the first comment in the first link tells you exactly why it might have been deleted.


Keep your conspiracies out of our undeletes.

That's why they are two different subreddits.  




 Oh, I misread your comment.

You were saying that if it's not a bacterial issue then don't give antibiotics.

I thought you said that we shouldn't give out antibiotics for bacterial infections. I was confused considering I am current suffering from an upper respiratory infection. 

Sorry about that. 




 Perhaps rule 0 like the last one?

It's not that funny.

Like 90% of /r/funny is rule 0 




 What about an upper respiratory infection?

 Or just a simple bread recipe. I plan on grilling some bratwurst this weekend and I'd really like an easy keto-friendly bun recipe.

 I have no idea where to begin. I thought taking this practice test provided [through the LSAC website](http://www.lsac.org/docs/default-source/jd-docs/sampleptjune.pdf) would be a good gauge on where I currently stand. 

So far I figured I suck at the logic games. 

I'd love to be able to score high by the December 8th test but I also know they have one in February too. Would it be better to wait until February?

I'm also not made of money and a lot of these tutoring sessions are half my monthly income. 

I've talked to a couple of friends I know who are in law school and they said that they had both taken courses. I think one did a private tutor (which cost him a shit load) and the other took a princeton review course (the lowest one being $1550 (3/4ths of my income)).

I've looked at the links provided on the sidebar and I hear the Blueprint is a decent service that's only under $900.

 I was thinking about that being a possibility. He said his head starting ringing, I thought that happens when you get hit in the temple.

 I totally get that.

He's bleeding internally due to injuries sustained from her kicking him in the stomach though.

That means his organs got messed up. That sounds like an emergency room visit. 




 Half the stuff on this subreddit it complete BS.

This guy got kicked so hard he was bleeding out of his mouth and he decided *not* to go the the hospital?  




 So she kicked you so hard you were bleeding out of your mouth?  

Then you didn't go to the hospital?  

I'm calling BS. 




 Because it's a lie.

 Yay! I'm so glad you liked them! 

I'll be frying some up tomorrow. I got a craving!  




 How? I'd like a change in career.  




 I have one too, I've made like $3 and I can't cash out until $100.

It's been over a year... 




 Here is the recipe!  

http://cavemanketo.com/crispy-wings/  

If you're trying to cut back on fat, then baking would be best.

I'm on the keto diet so I'm just trying to limit my carb intake and let me tell you, I fry chicken thighs this way and I can't believe how crispy they turn out! 

 




 I find that cooking the broccoli helps more.  




 I do it over the stove, I think if you're using a deep fryer you use its lowest setting first (like 280F) and then crank it up to high (380F?) 




 All I get are pictures of Gary Oldman 




 "Blue" "Waffle" 




 Try the twice fry method:  

14 minutes on medium heat   

3 minutes on high heat   

They come out like breaded fried chicken. I'll never eat them any other way.  




 I've got this weird gut issue where if I eat too much raw broccoli I won't digest it and end up pooping chunks of raw broccoli.

 




 I was having a discussion with a cab driver while abroad in Mexico and he flat-out asked:  

"All black people are evil, right?"  

And just turned the question on him.  

"Are all brown people evil? Are all Asians evil? No? Well that's your answer."

 Wow, you must be in a fraternity (or you are 10) having said that last line.

do you only hate the guys that stole your college girlfriends?

I got a little mixed up, not 'TOS' but 'User Agreement' 

Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe this says that OP doesn't own his content once placed on reddit; reddit owns the content. 

So no, not public domain. My bad. 




 It's a site wide rule. 




 Ha! 'Legal protection'

Once it's on reddit it belongs to reddit.

You should read the User Agreement sometime. 

EDIT: fixed some incorrect information.  




 He was soliciting his story. Basically trying to make money off of it. That is 'self-promotion'

Make sense?  




 Can you ask him what he did. I've searched all around and haven't found a solution even when searching "AMD Rust fix".

 Why can't I watch the theatrical release of Anchorman 2? The only one I see on Netfilx is the extended edition which completely sucked.  




 Anyone know what the limit is? 




 I have a friend with the same card that doesn't have any issues. I believe that somehow it configured itself to use my CPU instead of my GPU to render everything. Like it didn't think I had a dedicated GPU. 




 The game ran completely fine before the experimental version came out. After that it has been super laggy. 




 I think this will be the last game I ever purchase in Alpha.

 Holy shit. 

121 went down to one lane a couple of weeks ago (where it enters Garland) and there were signs for miles saying "left lane closed ahead".  

We get 500m from where the lanes merge and what do you see? A bunch of assholes getting in the left lane to cut people off at the end.  

I placed my car between my lane and the left lane to stop them and all they did was drive in the shoulder to go around to be stuck at the end.  

I don't get it. 

EDIT: Looks like this isn't the proper, efficient thing to do! Don't be me; don't be wrong. 




 My worst enemy.  

5 years ago I went into a Firehouse Subs and asked for the hottest sauce they had.  

The man handed me this sauce.  

I placed a crap load on my sandwich, ate it all up with minimal tears, and left the store.  

That's when it hit me. It felt like Bruce Lee was in my stomach trying to kick his way out.

I drove to the nearest dollar store to pick up some pepto bismol and I felt James Bond drugged (from that scene in Casino Royale) as I walked to their bathroom where I proceeded to puke.  

  




 I hate Jake! I can't see him as a tough actor. 




 It was so surreal. 




 Oh, I completely agree! I enjoyed the loud. It made me feel like I was there. 




 I believe a lot of people were bitching about it being so loud.

I think it was loud on purpose. Like when Michael Cain's big reveal is practically inaudible due to the sound? Yeah, that might just be the director trying to convey how you would feel if you heard that. You hear the truth and then nothing else matters. 

Or the shuttle taking off? SHIT FLYING INTO SPACE IS LOUD...

 Wow! Fuck them! 




 There are 6 billion people in the world, I can guarantee that you aren't alone in anything.

Just like OP! 




 They sent me the same letter/email for 3 months straight.  

I never called in, I never upgraded, and the never forced me to upgrade.  
 
I believe it's just a scare tactic. And if what they did to me is similar to what they do to others, it should be illegal. 




 I have cable one too!

Don't worry, they sent me the same emails for 3 months and never did shit.

They're all bark and no bite.

 Also more urban legend:

 Nah man! People eat bugs in other countries for great reasons! They're abundant, they are a cheap source of protein, they are delicious!

Dude, they are fucking tasty!  




 I believe it was super similar to sunflower seeds. I'd definitely eat it again!

Where rivers flow  
Sat an old user  
With mysterious glow

Could be the gin  
Could be the shine  
Off his rear end  

It bounced down below  
To a town most quaint   
And made all the women  
Quiver and faint  

As bright as the sun  
As hot as sin  
Don't worry man  
It's just test_subject4255   




 And legend has it that they'll drop the worm in the bottle. If it dies before it hits the bottom, it's a good bottle of mescal.  




 It's a species of worm that feeds on the plant. It is just a worm, not a hallucinogen. 

There is a dish served in that area that is a bunch of the worms fried up. I've had it, it's pretty good!

 Eat the worm! It won't kill you.

 I read it all and this is exactly how I feel about it.  

When I didn't have the flair, I wanted it so bad and I got frustrated when people were getting in within a minute.  

Now that I have it, I've stopped playing. I want others to have a shot at that glorious feeling that comes after acquiring such a difficult flair.

 I have this phobia where I don't ever want to smell like ass.

I bought a bidet for that reason and I'm not around it (at work, etc.) I make sure to wet some TP before pooping to get my ass clean.

 Eh, I just want others to have a chance.

 Yeah, a close friend of mine has been wanting the mario flair for awhile. I sent her a picture through text.  
























 It's nuts!! I think about stupid ideas that are similar all the time!  




 Me too. I pick my ears and smell the wax. I scratch my scalp and sniff. I'm fucking weird.  




 I've never heard of that! 




 Yeah, it's definitely weird. It's totally normal though.

It's just like **pro**hibited 

 




 Yeah, but some are full of more shit than others.  




 Exactly. Reddit is a fan of progressivism.  




 Got it on my second game of the day, thanks Lucky!!! 




 You mainly see reddit criticize Republicans because of the policies they try to push through. One thing a lot of redditors stand behind (regardless of political affiliation) is net neutrality. Guess which party is strongly against it?  




 No OP! Now I'm on a How it's Made binge trip!!!

I feel like you just wanted to use this phrase even though its context isn't appropriate to this situation.

 How did this come about?  

[I don't know. I have not received a phone call from anyone at Miramax. I got a phone call from my agent saying that Harvey was pulling out, didn't want to make the movie. I just wanna know what the hell happened but I'm pretty sure it had something to do with young (Meryl Poster?) who's not my biggest fan. **Man, that fucking cunt from Miramax doesn't like me. As a matter of fact she doesn't like me at all. She considers me a boozing, womanizing, asshole that never deserved this in the first place...**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2Ujf9Qp66M t=1800)

Yeah, no fucking kidding you douche.  




 How do shit songs like IDFWU get such a huge hype? The song is the same shit over and over, it lacks creativity, it's TERRIBLE.

 Except, does it tell time? 




 ah shit, I thought we were in agreement that it was "Berenstain"

Now that I think about it, that's not what we agreed upon, my bad. 




 It was misleading because you don't opt out of your HIPAA rights with the care card, you opt out with their express prescription program.

 I never liked that guy. He always seemed like a douche. 




 Sweetening drinks/baked goods? 




 No shit!? What store? Maybe I can find one near me. 




 Thing is, they are so expensive!  




 Could you recommend a brand of carbless sweetener?  




 What do you use instead?
 




 It's found in a wide variety of powdered artificial sweeteners, from stevia to splenda. It's a starch and the ratio in stevia, splenda, is 1:1 so a 550 serving [bag of stevia](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/91hm25DmYML._SL1500_.jpg) will have 550g of carbs from maltodextrin. 

I know 1g carb per 1 tablespoon isn't a bad amount of carbs but I was startled when a friend of mine did the research. 

Anyhow, what do you think?

 Yeah, president Obama's request to ensure net neutrality had *nothing* to do with this decision.

/s

Thank Obama for listening to the people. Thank him for representing our interests. 

Edit: We can also thank the populace for voting for Obama in 2012. I can't imagine how this decision would have turned out if Romney was elected. The majority of republicans were/are against net neutrality.  




 Yes, please smoke underage so that the opposition can use you as a catalyst for their cause.

 It is.  

You usually pay for shipping and handling on the items.  

Big companies like Kraft, etc. will donate TONS of food to these regional food banks.  

You'll pay like $1.50 for a case of peanut butter or like $.32/lb for chicken.    




 It's not like I never believed Dubai *didn't* have poor people but I've never seen a picture that outlines the other side.

This is the first time I've been exposed to poverty of Dubai. I think that's what makes this picture unique and appreciated. 




 I ordered a pizza last night and I noticed on my receipt there was a "delivery fee" of like $2.  

Does that go to the driver? Should I calculate my tip based on that amount?    

Anyway, I still tipped the delivery driver $5 but I was just curious.    




 Here's the plot summary for anyone unable to watch it on YouTube:

It's a great episode.  




 It sucks it always comes off dickish. 

I just wanted to help out, he could be a non-native speaker.  




 Just to let you know:

I fucking hate Dr. Who AND 'How I met your mother'

The former is a cheap-ass show where every supporting actor fucking sucks at their job and the special effects are lame.

The latter because it's just not funny. Canned laughs all over the place and Ted is a fucking moronic character  




 The redditor that uses 'cause' in place of 'because'

They're two different fucking words.  




 I can't find any "Sugar Tax" in the article.

  Nice pic. It's hard for me to picture water not spraying out from the gap between my legs or between the seat and the butt crack

Oh, I need to answer this. You can adjust the position of the nozzle to get the perfect shot at your keester. 

Also, I'd recommend buying a foot stool. If you put your feet on it while pooping, your body will form the natural position for pooping. This gets the poop out easier and is easier on your colon. It's way more comfortable too.  




 There are some on Amazon that you can get for under $30. Don't pay more than $30.  




 I'd like to pursue comedy too. I can make people laugh pretty easily.

I'm currently seeking employment in a bigger city. One that has comedy clubs.  

You should do the same, try comedy out at a club. It's not just great for showing you if you're truly interested but it can help refine your talent.

 Masturbation.  




 Logic's really upfront with his influences, which is a lot better than jocking the style without giving props

Oh, and that is one thing I appreciate about him. He seems very grateful of the inspiration previous artists have gave him.  




 I completely agree. It works in Midnight Marauders (I'm currently listening to that album) but it absolutely does not in Under Pressure.  




 I sleep on my back with my feet straight up.  




 I cannot understand why Logic chose to audio morph these endings. 

I appreciate learning about different anecdotes about him and the creation of the album but I just cannot understand why he made them all choppy and weird. It really kills the flow of the album, IMO. 

Here's some samples of what I'm talking about in case you haven't listened to the album:

['Metropolis' outro](http://youtu.be/4bdMtenCBjc?t=4m42s)  

['Buried Alive' outro](http://youtu.be/tqJ24z5ys4U?t=5m17s)

['Bounce' outro](http://youtu.be/ENDuSctl8h4?t=3m45s)

ETC.

I really love the album, I think the beats and lyrics are awesome. I just don't get it.  




 I'm good at drawing shit.

 Would you like me to draw you a picture?

 I'm not sure why you and I are being downvoted...  




 What the shrek did you just shreking say about me, you little puss-in-boots? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Shreks, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on fairytale creatures, and I have over 300 confirmed layers. I am trained in donkeh warfare and I'm the top shreker in the entire Duloc armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will shrek you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before in this swamp, mark my shreking words. You think you can get away with coming into my swamp? Think again, mothershreker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of ogres across Duloc and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, swamp maggot. The storm that shreks out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking shreked, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can shrek you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare ear tube antenna things. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed shrekage, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Ogre Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to shrek your miserable ass off the face of my swamp, you little long-nosed puppet. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your shreking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn trespasser. I will shrek fury all over you and you will drown in in the mud of my swamp. You're shreking shreked, kiddo.

 Not all liberal arts degree holders are like that. Pls don't group me.  




 The average amount of debt for my class at my private school was like $23k. Divide that by 4 and the average yearly cost was $5,750 a year.

 




 Yeah, and all these 'engineers' bitching about 'LE LIBRAL ARTS R BAD'  

The school I went to had so many graduates move on to medical school and other degree programs. My school was/is notorious for getting graduates out in four years. There were/are plenty of undergraduate research opportunities available. I could go on.  

Sure, they're not meant for everyone but neither is higher education.  

I'd say it was well worth the 10k a year I paid.
