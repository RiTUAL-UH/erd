 I was baptised a second time (first as baby) last year and this thread is making me really regret it and hold some animosity towards that church that let me go through with it. They knew I was baptized once but insisted on doing it again when I came back to God. 




 I was baptised as a baby in an Anglican church then again last year when I came back to Christ. The church I attended at the time inisted I get re-baptized. I am going through this thread and see a second baptism is unnecessary - what should I do? Was a second baptism a sin or...what?

 Well now that you've met Matlock, swiped his pills....""Take one every hour to prevent spastic heart convulsions." 




 Throne of Thunder is considered a Legacy Raid and uses the old loot system. You can run each boss, regardless of difficulty, once per week for a chance to get a Secret. Once you kill a Throne boss, your chance is used up for that week.

Siege of Orgrimmar uses the new loot system. You can repeatedly kill the first 8 bosses in LFR/normal for 1 secret per boss, for a total of 8 secrets.

Additionally, Lei Shen and Sha of Pride have a 100% drop rate on your first kill.

So if you're really unlucky, you can still get 9 per week. 1 Lei Shen, 8 from Siege of Orgimmar if you grind it out until each boss from Immerseus to Nazgrim drops one.

After that, you need 12 Runestones, which only drop from ToT Wings 3  4 and SoO Wings 1  2. Me and a guildie grinded out the Runestones in a single day, as we were very lucky with the drops from Throne of Thunder. After that you need the Heart of Lei Shen, which you can run Pinnacle of Storms again the same week as Runestones and he will drop it guaranteed.

If you have 0 Secrets, you can earn 9 guaranteed this week if you grind SoO 1/2 and kill Lei Shen. Say you are unlucky again and only earn another 9 next week: you will be unable to get the Cloak. You need to get at least 11 Secrets this week to even have a shot at getting the Cloak.

You have 2.5 weeks, as Warlords launches on a Thursday. Good luck. 




 1. Don't go to Wal-Mart.

2. You can get WoW to run a high-medium for about $500. I would suggest going to /r/buildapc and posting this same thread there. They will pick out the exact parts you need if you can (or know someone who can) build it themselves. This is your best and most cost-effective option.

Alternatively, you can get something from Amazon like [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0089KDCIU/ref=s9_hps_ft_g147_i1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DERpf_rd_s=center-3pf_rd_r=0YT7SJ0R85ZDVP3ZB0KZpf_rd_t=1401pf_rd_p=1880497982pf_rd_i=1000933821) or [this](http://www.amazon.com/CyberPowerPC-Gamer-Ultra-Gaming-PC/dp/B009RRJ1SE/ref=sr_1_1?s=pcie=UTF8qid=1414593804sr=1-1keywords=gaming+computer) which will run the game quite well.

 I read a while back that the government had this big tax break program for students to get their own laptops or something. Of course most ended up using their computers for free games like LoL, causing a Brazilian [Eternal September.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September)

Most Brazilians don't listen (or understand) to instruction, heed raid warnings or even know how to play their class. [In free games like LoL or Dota 2, they are notoriously worse, as the barrier for entry is access to a computer with Internet.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1eluep/brazilians_need_their_own_server/ca1qkmp)

I think it has to do with language and cultural differences. Firstly, they cannot read nor speak English and therefore, are inable to read English class guides, communicate with English-speaking players or learn to play their class effectively. Secondly, South Americans, Brazilians in particular, are extremely proud (some would say arrogant) people - look at the World Cup for proof. If you try to offer criticism and help in a game, you either get Portuguese in return (hue), insulted or ignored.

So you have language barriers + cultural differences (e.g. patriotism/pride) + an Eternal September because of the supposed "free laptops" thing + lag = [a recipe for disaster.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1eluep/brazilians_need_their_own_server/ca1hsmt) 




 I'm going to say $300-400, around the price of the Aquila, maybe a bit more. It's less of a combat-capable ship than the Aquila, but serves in a similar role.

  Says who?

As a Christian, God only knows. I believe Jesus lived the perfect life and Christians should try to follow him, although we will always fail. 




 I don't know if you're being funny or not, but the story was told to a Jewish Pharisee. There are many layers to the parable, but one of the subjects of the story is the "good" son, who envied the prodigal son. Jesus was making the point of not being "holier-than-thou" and instead, act in humility and give thanks that your brother has returned from the depths of sin. 




 I am ilvl 558 and primarily raid Heroic (old normal) while occasionally playing Unholy with the same gear. Should I optimize for a DPS build, or stay survivability?

 What? I am saying that Jesus is uncreated - he was there in the beginning as John writes.

The poll indicates Evangelicals believe Adam + Eve, or whatever, came before Jesus, as if Jesus was created. 




 I am only on the first page but the thing that struck me was most DISAGREE Jesus was the firs thing God created. Have none of these people read John 1:1? 




 I would recommend Goblin for a new starting zone. Blood Elves and Draenei still use their old 1-15 zones from TBC, while the vanilla races use revamped vanilla zones.

  How can I better understand inflation?

The rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and, subsequently, purchasing power is falling. 

As inflation rises, every dollar will buy a smaller percentage of a good. For example, if the inflation rate is 2%, then a $1 pack of gum will cost $1.02 in a year.

http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp

In World of Warcraft, currency devaluation happens due to a number of factors: an increase in quest reward gold, lower barriers to entry for new producers/extractors, 6.0 currency conversion and gold buying. 

The biggest contributor is the increase in level cap and subsequently, increase in quest reward gold. In Cataclysm, the average daily quest would grant about 7.5 gold. In Mists of Pandaria, daily quests would grant about 11-25 gold. 

Resources have also become more widely available to farm, specifically Ghost Iron Ore. Previously, we had to level mining to max to farm the highest tier of ore. This is no longer the case, as Ghost Iron Ore is available for mining at mining level 1, making the barrier to market entry much lower. As more people sell and buy the ore, more money is exchanging hands and in turn, re-distributing wealth.

Furthermore, with the low bar to entry comes new ways to earn profit by means of production. If I farm all the materials I need for a Sky Golem, an engineering-produced mount, the materials will likely cost around 10-12,000 gold at average market value. But I farmed those materials myself, therefore the cost is significantly reduced. I then sell that Sky Golem for a whopping 15,000 gold or so. Not only did I make a profit of 3-5,000 gold on baseline market value, but I likely made much more as I produced the materials. Those materials I farmed netted me a healthy profit and introduced more gold into the market.

Additionally, the recent 6.0 patch had converted Valor and Justice Points into gold, which will be used as the go-to currency. The average player received about 1000 gold from this conversion, substantially increasing the amount of gold in the economy.

Then there are "intangibles," or things we have no data on as players - namely gold buying/selling for real world currency. Right now, the average gold buyer sells 10,000 gold for $7-10. Let's assume $1/1000 gold for simplicity's sake. There are two kinds of gold sellers - those who manually earn their gold through farming (be it mobs or materials), or those who sell gold from stolen accounts. The former are doing the same thing our Sky Golem manufacturer does; they are converting raw material into hard currency. While buying gold from these people is still illegal, their method of producing gold is technically not illegal. On the other hand, stolen accounts end up hindering the economy by not introducing new gold; they simply redistribute stagnant wealth.

I hope this helps.

TL;DR Greater quest rewards. Lower market entry for new extractors and producers. Currency conversions. Gold buying. 




 You can run Siege of Orgrimmar normal/heroic/mythic repeatedly until you get a Secret from all 8 bosses that drop one (Immerseus - Nazgrim). Throne of Thunder has 12 bosses that will drop one, but you only get one chance per boss a week due to the different legacy raid loot system it uses.

In theory, you can get 8+12, for 20 Secrets if every Throne of Thunder boss drops one (but that is highly unlikely). Lei Shen and Sha of Pride are guaranteed to drop Secrets, so if you do not have time to run SoO constantly to get 8, you can get at least 2 for sure.

After you finish Secrets, you need to collect the 12 Runestones. You will have 1.5 weeks next Tuesday, as WoD drops on a Thursday the 13th, two days after reset. 

If you finish Secrets this week, you can very easily get Runestones done by running SoO repeatedly for 8+1 (Lei Shen), then again on Tuesday/Wednesday the final week.

 Have you played through the revamped Cataclysm 1-60 leveling? If not, I highly recommend. 




 Free food. Any university student will thank you for it. 




 What else is there? 




  celigaycy

Love it, though no homo. It's less bad for me to have sex than it is for you. 




 My advice: ignore schooling, job obligations (if you have one) and nearby friendships - focus on your girlfriend first, since she is the most important thing in your life as I can tell. Is her timezone ahead or behind you? If ahead, skip school to get extra Skyping time when she is at home. If behind, vice versa. As a mature young adult, this relationship will likely last for many years to come and you should do your best to help foster that growth. School, job...these came come later (night school for example). Don't waste this opportunity for romance that some people never have. 




 The female is scared easily by males approaching out of the blue, without any prior relationship. Don't bother - you will come off creepy and weird, especially when you cannot speak Spanish (I presume). 




 My girlfriend of two years found a box of ~~lewd~~ old videos and photos from ex-girlfriends. All of these are several years old and predate my current girlfriend. She was really upset and wants me to throw all of them away, but they have ~~masturbatory~~ sentimental value to me. Should I get rid of them? It's causing a lot of conflict. Never mind that we're a couple - my happiness is paramount to everything. 




 You do have the right to happiness; that's why I said you should kick her out. She can sell all those "pointless" things that she bought you for Christmas like a Game Boy or TV or whatever to pay for her first month's rent.

 While you could try to keep in contact via Facebook or other social media, the best option would be to move and cut off all contact with them. If they don't want to hang out in person, they won't make the effort to do it online.

If they were your real friends they would stick by you, since they should worry about your happiness - that is the most important thing. 




 She raised you for 20~ years, fed you, bathed you, housed you, free of charge. But now that she is a minor inconvenience to your happiness, that woman has got to go.

You did the right thing by coming here, rather than not discussing this with her or your sister. 




 She is a useless bloodsucker; dump her. 




 You cannot get to Perendi in a Sidewinder - the jump range is too short. 




 Yes. Keep track of what bosses drop secrets, so you know which ones to repeat again. Up to Nazgrim, each has the chance to drop 1 per week, regardless of difficulty. Keep running SoO until all 8 have dropped one. 




 Because in-engine replay systems are very difficult to make, not because developers are lazy. 




 Only the SoO bosses allow you to get repeat kills. ToT is a one-kill-a-week chance, regardless of difficulty. 




 I would like to get a whole branding package if possible. [Here is my current organization](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/orgs/HOLST), but I think it could look a lot better.

What do you guys think? 




 But Marge, that little guy hasn't done anything yet, and you know it's going to be good. 




 I would assume the animations are change server-side to be shown to you as proper third person animations. Think of it like this:

Your friend performs a melee. It looks good to them in first-person, but would look like shit, as seen in the video, in third person. The developer creates another set of third person animations that only other players see when you perform certain actions. When your friend performs a melee, that action is sent to the server client, which feeds it back to you, so you get the proper third person set of animations. 

If you played the game with the proper multiplayer third person animations, in first person, it would probably not play properly, if not look entirely fucked up to begin with (e.g. eyeball height, weapon size, field of view are all different when playing in first person). 




  no marketing building expectations.

What the hell do you call all the trailers and cinematics then? 




 In the same boat, my friend. Depression sucks. 




 The sidebar has our subreddit poll with our favourite books. Every book on there is authentic - not realistic, as we don't have their levels of technology yet - but authentic in that they feel realistic and gritty. For example, District 9 or Battlefield 4 are nowhere near realistic, but they are authentic.

 Sprawl = Vast metropolitan area that stretches along the entire North American East Coast, made up of megacities and (usually in disrepair) geodesic domes that help protect people from pollution.

Ninsei = the downtown of Night City.

 You're trying to find your faith but reject any Christian-based teaching people here try to give you. One of the tenants of Christianity is about humility - it's about admitting your wrong and don't have all the answers. I pray that you will gain at least a piecemeal sliver of Christ's humility. 




  does the bible say this is wrong?

Yes it does, many, many times.

 However we would rather have a "traditional" ceremony and have a house waiting for us.

You don't always get what you want. If you want to get married to her, do it. Have the ceremony later. You sound like a flake to me from your OP. 




 Yeah, compared to other old school MMOs maybe. But look at what people are suggesting - FFXIV and ArcheAge. Are you joking? FFXIV has what...3 raid tiers and about a dozen dungeons? ArcheAge maybe, since its emergent PvP content will provide some hundreds of hours.

But WoW has 16 tiers of raiding AND PvP content + professions + dungeons + questing + achievements + pet battles....I could go on. On my one account alone I have sunk over 2,000 hours. My old account (before it was banned for buying gold) had about the same. Still not bored with the game; I do have the occasional couple months break, but I don't seem to ever quit the game entirely.

 Hey folks, anyone here play WoW? With the new 6.0 patch out, we got lots of new stuff to play around with. I help run a guild that was founded on Christian principles, but is explicitly not a "Christian" guild. If anyone wants to play (I got 9 90s), add me at Toxilium#1491 









 I had a Cutlass before they announced the variants. I was excited to see if they made any changes to my existing ship, so I logged in. To my dismay, my hangar is completely empty, as the only ships I own are the Cutlass and Reclaimer (unavailable in hangar). 





























 Socrates died for this shit 




 nitesmoke deleted his account. the admins have /r/wow now 




 There is no proof he received calls at work. Furthermore, the only thing "doxxed" was his dating profile which NITESMOKE PUT UP HIMSELF. 

He acted in a childish, stupid manner, bullied people, and we all know he called people fags on this very sub. Yet here he is as this social justice champion. Funny how he suddenly becomes a White Knight when he's the one being attacked?

He's a compulsive liar, don't listen to anything he says. 




 He deleted his twitter and reddit account to cover his tracks. 




 You all get Nitesmoke Wolf mounts and the title, Liberator of Gay Rights 




 I would be very wary of anything Nitesmoke is telling us. First, he comes out as some social justice champion for LGBT rights. What? That shit is completely unrelated.

Second, he's changed his story multiple times to cover up his own childish behavior. He couldn't play WoW for a couple days and had a suck attack. That's the whole story. 




 He wants to pass blame for having a completely over-the-top, inappropriate and childish reaction to "Wah, I cannot play WoW."

Instead of owning up to his actions, he jumped on the hot-button issue of today (LGBT rights) and became a SJW in a short paragraph of bullshit.

In the words of a famous Blizzard dev: Fuck that loser.

 Diablo 3 is doing something similar with seasons. You start fresh each season (joining it is optional) and level up a new character from 1, with 0 gold or crafting materials. After about 6-8 months they'll reset and start season 2. 




 My first time tanking was on a bought Prot Warrior account. I paid to change the troll to Draenei male and went into Utgarde Pinnacle completely unprepared. No idea how to hold threat, no idea what any of my skills did. The group disbanded before the first boss.

The account was later banned for being traded lol.

 FYI to anyone considering purchasing the account - Blizzard is VERY on the ball when it comes to account trading. They WILL track your IP address, password changes, etc. to the account and will give a temporary suspension, without warning, if they suspect the account was traded (which is against the ToS). It has happened to me twice and I would be very cautious when trading any Blizzard account.

I have traded accounts like elite dangerous and eve online in the past, but they do not go to the extraordinary lengths Blizzard goes through to stop account trading. You've been warned. 




 890 Jump - because I'm an idiot who likes shiny new things.

Horney Ghost LTI - traded elite dangerous for this bad boy.

AMD Mustang - cheapest ship for around $30 that comes with arena Commander. It also looks cool. 




 What the hell are you talking about? Developers don't give money to publishers. The publisher funds the developer(s) and in turn, reaps the largest reward from sales. 




 Watching any sports, esports or similar event will be like that. I don't watch NHL or NFL but when I go to a live game I get super into the match

 Westboro misread the story where Jesus curses the fig tree for not producing fruit.

GOD

HATES

FIGS 




 I am a Christian and one of the last duties Christ gave was for us to go out into the world, preach the gospel and baptize people in the name of the Son/Father/Holy Ghost.

But the way these street preachers "spread God's Word*" is not the best way to go about doing that imo.

I won't go into it much since this isn't /r/christianity, but basically Christians should follow like Jesus did - he performed miracles, signs and aided people *then* followed up with his message as people inevitably asked questions. Most of the stories or parables in the Gospel are told *after* someone comes up and asks Jesus "Hey, Rabbi, why should I do y or how do I do x?" I never recall Matthew 45:16 "Then the Son of God went out into Los Angeles and held up a sign and preached to all the sinful nerds and they were saved that day."

*Funnily enough, most people think "God's Word" is the Bible. In Islam, God's Word is a physical book (the Quran), while in Christianity, God's Word is Jesus himself. The Bible wasn't even completed and compiled yet when John 1:1 was written...

 Read The Time Ships if you havent. Fav sci-fi book that is a sequel to HG wells The Time Machine. If you think Interstellars ending was crazy, Time Ships will melt your brain. 




 I think you are being a tad extreme. This is an internet forum where we're all anonymous. I don't equate these discussions to persecution of the early Christians.

I was simply raising the point that this sub seems to downvote unpopular beliefs, despite said beliefs being grounded in scripture. A good sub should upvote any post worthy of proper discussion, regardless of one's opinion or worldview. 




 Didn't you know that in this sub we upvote life-affirming reddit-friendly (i.e. usually liberal) worldviews and downvote anything we disagree with, even if there is scriptural proof to back up said views?

After Ghosts, I'm happy this is shaping up to be a great CoD. 
























 I have a GTX 670 that will run any emulator and most AAA games at 60FPS maxed. Looking to get 165 (w/shipping) for it. 




 GPU is in great working condition, with a little wear on the back panel.

Acer monitor just bought Aug 2013, so still works perfect. Keybord has evidence of wear and tear (see timestamp), but otherwise fine. Samsung monitor is a bit smaller at 1680x1050, but works fine as well. All monitors include cables.

Looking to get ~~$160~~150 incl. shipping or best offer for GPU. Taking offers for other components.

Verified PayPal only, I will invoice you and provide tracking number once shipped. Also willing to trade for Dragon Age Inquisition + $$$

 FFXIV feels incredibly empty and solo-friendly. I joined Balmung for roleplay, but the RP community practically ignores you if you're not some "notice me senpai" Miqo'te in one of their little cliques. 




 No its very easy to catch up in WoW. I quit because the new xpac is more of the same, but my guildies are enjoying it a lot. 




 The 980 is a luxury item compared to the 970, so they have free reign to charge whatever they want and know people will still buy it as it's the #1 in the world.

Personally I went for a 970 and used the money I would have spent on a 980 to get a QNIX 1440p monitor. Far Cry 4 maxed at 53-60 FPS! 




 Christianity's "cliff note" is on our sidebar. "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."

 I got a Cardboard and E:D with it was awful. Google Cardboard is a novelty at most, something fun for a couple minutes with VR-supported android games. 




 I'm ugly and I'm proud! 




 I'm sure they're great, but as a game dev and writer myself, it is hard to get into the same plot again when you know everything that will happen. Same issue with Far Cry 4, but Pagan Min is intriguing enough to continue. 




 Congratulations. I pray you have a long and happy marriage :) 




 This is WoW for me. I am unsubbed from WoW now due to new expansion burnout but it will probably drag me away from FFXIV in a few months 




 How do you have so much time? 




 Is it still the same BioWare story? A villain emerges. You get tasked with assembling a team to combat said villain. You then spend some time doing side missions and building sidekick loyalty, meanwhile you do 2-3 main missions to further the main plot. You do a mission and discover villain hideout, master plan or both. You do a big epic finale. End. 




 I'm ugly and I'm proud. 




 A hi-fi indie space dogfighter with 10~ maps and some different modes and about 5 ships is maybe worth $20 at most. 




 lol 




 Heated seats and windows? This community really needs to get its priorities straight - the fish tank AI needs a serious re-tuning. 




 Want more threads about miqo'te butts? 




 Who cares? 




 While all of you are complaining, I was able to make a character after having just bought the game on sale this afternoon!

No longer need to get up at 6AM tomorrow for Balmung :D 




 Practically every fantasy F2P MMO on the market can fill your needs.... 




 Lineage ~~Two~~ One is most popular after WoW. 




 Mortal Online is a dying, empty POS. 




 Does the gil offer only work on Hyperion?  




 Take a break unless it is a game that you really want to play. I got a bunch of new games recently from Black Friday, but the only one I desire to play is Skyrim. Even the new WoW xpac bores me. 




 I am Christian myself so overly "gamer l33t" stuff like this with Jesus tacked on makes me cringe a bit, but a friend tipped me off about [Game Church](http://gamechurch.com/) a while back.

They basically are an on-line ministry that goes to big gaming events like E3, where they get involved in the community through a Christian gamers podcast, forum, hand out free Bibles, etc. 




 If World of Warcraft interests you, there is a guild called Old Farts which is mostly comprised of 30+ years, the average being in their early 40s. My own WoW guild is mostly late 20s to late 30s, with a few in their late 40s even.

There are plenty of guilds your age, but they require a bit more effort to find. 




 No. Give us the coordinates.

 You'll get your money's worth for the questing and dungeons. At end-game, once you have done all the dungeons and maybe dabbled in some raiding, not much else going for it

 good lord.... 




 Murder is murder.  




 Questing was great. Garrisons were fun during leveling too but at 100...the expansion shows its true colors. It's okay, but still more of the same (I don't know what I expected). 1 daily quest, no real 100 content outside of some repeatable heroics. Here's hoping the raids are awesome. 




 Similar story. When I was working in Laos PDR all I had was an Asus gaming laptop and Assassins Creed Brotherhood and the Office seasons 1-6. I had no other games on me for 3 months.

I 100% AC:B multiple times, must have put in 200 hours into that game. I rewatched all the Office episodes I had too.

If anyone ever goes away for a while, buy a Kobo and load it with books. You will go insane off a couple games and a show. 




 OP, you wasted 30 seconds of my life and I want them back. 




 He would have used punctuation and formatting 




 Don't take anything from brictop. Known scammer who reposts his Black Widow keyboard. Will contact you through PM only as he's banned 




 I have a GTX 670 I'm looking to sell as I bought a 970. I don't need RAM that much but I can sell you the card for 165. 




 Similar question as OP; I mainly play WoW, space sims (Star Citizen) and the odd FPS like Far Cry 3. I got a 970 from newegg, do you think that can run 1440p, 144 or 4k? Which should i look at getting and is 4k worth it with only one card? My mobo is incapable of doing SLI. 




 The pirates are so powerful they blew up the moon 




 http://i.imgur.com/QPLpNdk.jpg

 Sounds reasonable. I'll bump down my OP then to $165 OBO 




 That's why I included or best offer. How much would you pay for it? 









 He is banned from posting, that's why he will PM you instead 




 I have a GTX 670, $150 shipped. 




 If brictop comes to you in a PM, ignore him. He is a scammer and known to resell his Black Widow mechanical keyboard 




 Does 2 year insurance on a starter really matter that much? You'll be out of your Aurora and into a 300 or Cutlass within a few weeks I'd imagine.

Keep your package, it has alpha and will save you money long run. 




 Like I said - its an optional subscription if you want to see more behind the scenes stuff every month. The game just requires a pledge package for now 




 No 




 It's a development subscription - you get access to the magazine, a forum I think, some concept art. It's basically an additional way of supporting CIG and you get some cool Making-Of stuff on the side each month 




 Teach me your secrets. 




 Confirmed this is me. I couldn't post from this account as I was getting Reddit's anti-spam pop-up "Your last posts didn't do well." 




 Well I did just [list my account for sale](http://www.reddit.com/r/Starcitizen_trades/comments/2n1rmf/black_market_890_jump_specter_lti_m50_amd_mustang/), since I'd have no idea what to do with all the credits I'd rather just make a new account and buy an Aurora. 




 Can confirm, I am the same person. Wanted to get the post out there but couldn't do it from this account due to Reddit's self-posting rules to reduce spambots. 




 The annual subscription is $240 as well. I am considering doing what OP did...but I have 740 in credit if I did that. 




 Well now I feel guilty for owning an 890 Jump

Edit: sold everything for $700, still have amd mustang and $40 credit to spare for future modules. 




 Aurora LN is the best for that. LX is simply the "deluxe" version, which means it comes with a jump drive (that you can buy for the LN) and a leather seat (and who cares about that because it's a game). 




 I'd take a GTX 980 over a picture of a spaceship any day 




 Yeah, 6000 freight units (compared to 1600 in my 890) is nothing to scoff at... 




 Nothing yet. I have the Super Hornet upgrade, UEE Coat and Pistol sitting in my cart ($65 total). I am considering melting my Specter Package and buying a Merchantman, or melting my 890 Jump and getting 2-3 different ships. Or melt both packages for $740 total to get a ton of stuff 




 I'd melt the Cutlass for the Freelancer personally. The freelancer appeals to me more, but they're both good ships. 




 Get more insurance? 




 All of my ships are untradeable as I melt - buy - melt etc. 




 Someone pointed out to me the MM may be the most difficult to get as its an alien ship. The others, Starfarer and Caterpillar (I am not interested in the Ret/Glad) would be quite easy to obtain if you had the in-game credits for them.

So I am deciding if I should scrap buying the Hornet Upgrade for my Specter pack, and just go with a MM. 




 I have a Specter Hornet Ghost package from last year w/ LTI. Maybe I should melt that and pick up a MM 




 I don't think it will, based on my ~~3 second~~ in-depth analysis of the one concept picture they've released.

Why would it need to? It's just a trade ship. All it needs is a big cargo container and some guns. 




 You'd barely be able to pilot it too. I could *maybe* understand if you were the leader of say...TEST and had lots of money and hands available to help pilot. But you and I are single pilots - the most expensive ship I have is a Jump and even now I'm considering melting down to something smaller. 




 I wouldn't be either. People love to throw away their disposable income. 




 Looks really cheap. I'd pay a dollar at most 




 $2500 for a spaceship? No fucking way 




 Banu for commerce, hands down every day of the week. The retaliator is a bomber and little more.

Caterpillar is more of an in-between, as its designed for boarding and trade. 




 I have been eyeing the Banu MM and Starfarer for quite a while. I love the dirty, more cyberpunk feel to the ships than the 890 Jump. But the Jump is limited edition.

Do you guys think I should hang onto it? Right now my cart has the Super Hornet Upgrade, UEE Coat and the Aurora LX. 




 Absolutely. Best MMO on the market in the "theme park" genre. Everything about the game screams polish. WoW is the only MMO I can install, jump into and simply play without having to dick around with controls, graphics, annoying UI or weird mechanics. It's fairly simple, it's fun and it works.

On the 21st they're having their 10th anniversary special day, where they're releasing a special 40-man raid with a free mount, pet and helmet. 




 I'll be Gus, the lovable engine sweep; clean as a whistle, sharp as a thistle, best in all Westminster, yeah!

 The best way to start would be in prayer and in the Bible. Pick a Gospel (I recommend John) and get reacquainted with scripture. Ask lots of questions and try to understand what the author is writing (or what Jesus is saying). Perhaps get a biblical commentary to help you understand the underlying themes and meaning.

Additionally, 

 I no longer go to church

Start going to church. Ignore that crap on the Internet about "existential Christianity" or "home churches." Find a real church. It doesn't matter what kind to start, as long as they practice sound doctrine. Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, Baptist, it really doesn't matter since they teach essentially the same thing: God loved the world so much he sent his only Son, so that whoever believes in Him will not die but have everlasting life.

Ask your friends for some church recommendations or maybe go with them one Sunday. I know you're introverted (so am I), but make an honest effort, ask God in prayer, to get out of your shell and get connected with other Christians. Join a life/study group, volunteer at charity events and give yourself to the poor.

 Is it possible for me to do this in the comfort of my room

No. A Christian is called to go out into the world and *interact* with other people. Christ didn't sit in Nazareth and send people out to do his bidding - he went into the towns and ate with sinners and healed the sick.

 I'm thinking of contacting my old friend but I know she is very busy..

If she is the Christ-loving girl you make her out to be, she probably won't care and would love to sit down and talk with you. Make the effort, give her a phone call. Don't email her, don't text her. Call. Her. Phone.

Good luck buddy. 




 Use the search function since this has been discussed many, many times.

Essentially as a Christian you're to follow the law of the land (whatever state/country you reside in). If cannabis is illegal, you can't smoke it. If it is, go nuts, but do it in moderation as to not become addicted. 




 I am guessing you don't have a toddler or spent any time around young children to see how incredibly selfish we are before we learn about etiquette and being good. Kids are assholes to each other.

It's the Christian belief we are sinful and broken *by nature,*  This sinfulness is a condition we brought upon ourselves and cannot be rectified by ourselves. You don't even need a history book or a TV to see evidence of this - sin permeates all societies of mankind, big or small. 




 Because meaning would be defined arbitrarily, simply on the whim of the individual. Who has the final say without some universal standard? These are the questions I asked myself for 10+ years on my path back to Christianity from Atheism.

I am not claiming to know anything; they're just fun questions to challenge ourselves with once in a blue moon. 




 But again...there is no point to their lives either, so why bother reduce suffering? In the words of Rust, we've become too self aware. Why not all just walk into that one last sunset? 




 That line of reasoning makes no sense 




 We need more Jews (and Orthodox) here. You guys tell it like it is. 




 If it bleeds it leads. 




 You millenials can't take a joke. 




 DAE euphoria? 




 They also believe Jesus is literally the Son of God, not just Protestants.

Source: am anglican/catholic 




  we could just as easily start a cult where we make all the adherents do their best to actually act and live as they believe 'Jesus' would have acted and lived, had he been in their shoes. 

So, Christianity?

 Muhammad had a 9 year old wife. How can you call a religion one of peace and love when its founder was a paedophile?

Those extremists are fundementalists, I.e. they follow Islam to the tee. Most Muslims are moderate and ignore the evil in their own hadith and Quran. I'd say this is God acting in their hearts to be more Christ-like. 




 No and likely never will considering he deleted his twitter and reddit account.

 No, it's not, but that shouldn't excuse the frankly bullshit "apology" he gave us, then he has the audacity to start a charity drive for an anti-bullying NGO? Are you fucking kidding me mate?

He's trying to cover up his own personal failings with the moral high ground and I'm glad most people in this thread are seeing through the bullshit. 




 He has no proof of said calls. He doxxed himself with a dating profile he posted. He is a known liar and general dickhead, frequent bully who uses the word fag like everyone else on the Internet. He's now being bullied and trying to cover his tracks. He has yet to apologize for his childish behavior.

 They are generally more relatable, as a group of misfits who all are living through Kirkwall's conflicts together. DAO's companions all kind of hated each other and DAI's companions just kind of latch onto the Inquisitor for their own personal gain (other than the original companions, e.g. Cassy and Cullen).

 He will play each for 10 minutes, get bored, then never touch them for the rest of his life. 




 Same with EA and their Dragon Age performance...I got 50FPS in Dragon Age 2 with my 970............. 




 I played Inquisition for about an hour with only the Keep video to help and I didnt know what was what or why mages were fighting templars, what the chantry was, etc. I then played through DAO and DA2, skipping most pointless side quests and just did the main stories and DLC. Playing Inquisition is drastically more enjoyable as all your actions carry more weight and you can see the cause and effect from past choicss that you made (rather than some website flash game). 




 Granted it wouldnt have the same impact. I did the Keep before DAO and DA2 and had no idea what was happening. There id no explanation about the mages plight in Thedas, who the Templars are, what Ferelden is, etc 




 I spent last night in a ditch 




 I think it's better than Origins. I just finished playing DAO and DA2 for the first time ever this past month to prepare myself for DAI which I started on Saturday. 




 Absolutely. Incredible game - make sure you play Dragon Age Origins and 2, or else the story and lore won't make much sense. 




 Why make a big post on Reddit? Why wouldn't one's immediate reaction to call EA Origin customer service? 




 I wouldn't call an unfinished alpha an "incredible game." Let's wait for release.

 I have never played through any Dragon Age and just finished Origins this past Friday :) Now about 40% through DA2. While I don't like the environments as much, the combat is way better (especially since I played mage in both).

Can't wait for Inquisition !! 




 Considering the state of modern AAA gaming - unoptimized ports that do not take advantage of all 4 cores, let alone 8 - I doubt the 8 cores will be of any advantage for quite some time unless you're doing video editing or something CPU-intensive. 




 Your CPU will rarely get to anywhere near 100% load on most games. If you want to burn your CPU, use Prime95.

As for games, it's the usual; check drivers first, uninstall old drivers, play around in-game settings and try other higher-end games (as CSGO and Smite look like last-gen games). 




 Just saying with his budget...if I were him I'd save up and get a 970 next year when the new 1080 or whatever the heck comes out. 




 Operating system?  




 When my 970 FTW really works hard I do get a bit of coil whine but its unnoticeable when game audio gets loud (or wearing headphones).

Performance wise, I get 50-60FPS maxed at 1440p in the most demanding games. Crysis 3 at max, MSAAx2, gives me about 45FPS and that is easily the most demanding game on market. The only game that is killing me is Dragon Age Inquisition @ 35-50FPS on *high* (not max). Can you say *unoptimized console port?*

If I knew about the coil whine before, I would have bought another card and down the "FTW" overclock myself. 




 You know you need to rebuy Windows for a new PC, right? 




 Get a GTX 660 - they're slightly better than a 750ti and will cost about $190 + tax. 




 I have changed it manually in-game. When I overclock to 120 or even 96, the frame skipping tests showed positive. I think my monitor just can't overclock. 




 He can build it himself and use the extra $300 to upgrade the GPU to a 970, get a CPU cooler and have change to spare

Edit: forgot to add ~$80 for the case.

Below is the same build on that website.

 How long ago did you apply thermal paste? 




 Wow very solid build man. Ask for a 1440p monitor for Christmas, $300 from Korea (ebay) :) Do you have a disc drive to install Windows?

 Do i need a cpu cooler (other than stock)?

Only if you plan on overclocking your CPU (which the 4690 can do in spades). I have the same cooler as you - let's me get up to 4.5GHz on my i5.
 Do i need thermal paste?

Yes. They're dirt cheap and necessary

 minus an anti-static wrist band, anything else i need to fully build a pc?

Get an old credit card for the thermal paste. If you have a friend with a nice toolbox, ask to borrow it (or get your friend to help build!). 




 Others reported getting their QNIX to 120Hz just fine. I tried OCing to 144Hz for fun and got crazy graphical glitches so clearly Nvidia is doing it's job. Maybe I just cannot see the difference. 




 Various benchmarks (heaven, valley), this website: http://www.testufo.com/#test=framerates

Far cry 4, dragon age 1/2/3, etc. All look the same 60 or 120 (I lower settings as I see fit to get them to run up to 120).

Strange thing is the testing website gives me 120Hz and games say the same thing. Windows says 120Hz. Nvidia says 120Hz. Even FRAPS and Shadowplay say 61+ FPS yet I cannot see a visual difference for the life of me. 




 I overclocked my QNIX to 120Hz and don't notice any difference from 60FPS :( 




 I thought you can buy any EA game and play it for 24 hours then return it? Or is that only for PC? 




 You get the same kind of goodies with other pre-orders; how is this any different? 

 Even if there's problems at release, they will be promptly fixed and all new content for the game will be free.

But how do you *know* this? Every developer has claimed the same, yet time and time again this is not always the case. 

Watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf5Uj4XIT1Y

What is with this attachment people having to developers? You don't know them. You don't work with them or for them. You pay them money for a product when it *releases.* Pre-ordering is so incredibly fucking pointless for digital products, it boggles the mind why someone except the most rabid of fanboy would go through with it.

I don't fucking care if Witcher 1 and 2 were great (they were). You don't work for CDProjekt Red. They could have entirely new management for all we know and completely fuck up Witcher 3. You don't know. All you have is this blind, unfounded faith in a group of Polish game developers. It makes no fucking sense. 




 I tried overclocking mine and Nvidia and Windows BOTH said it was at 120Hz at some point...yet I saw no difference with mouse, window and in-game movement. Maybe my eyes "can't see past 60fps?"

The online monitor test said it was at 120hz too, yet the 120 and 60fps UFOs didn't show any difference.

http://www.testufo.com/#test=framerates 




 Why are you pre-ordering? What fucking purpose does that serve? Have you learned nothing from other games?

I don't care if GabeN himself came into your room with Half-Life 3 and offered it as a pre-order - don't fucking pre-order games. There's no point anymore. 




 Get a 1440p monitor for now - you will notice a substantial difference from 1080p, a single high-end GPU can run the vast majority of games at 60FPS on max settings and they're fairly inexpensive (I got my QNIX 1440p monitor within 2 days from Korea for $300). 




 750ti is shit for the price they're probably offering. 




 I am running a GTX 970 @ 1440p, with an i5-3570k @ 4.5GHz. I should not be getting FPS stutters in a game like Dragon Age 2.

What gives? This game is optimized horribly. It goes anywhere from 45 to a constant 60 (which is where it should be all the time). 




 Staples employee here. Same deal - diagnostic for $50, then whatever we need to do is extra. Usually around $150 for a whole setup dealy 




 For the 200 price range, 660 is good, 760 is best. I do have an old GTX 670 since I upgraded recently, but I can't explicitly sell things on this subreddit (that's what /r/hardwareswap is for).

http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/high_end_gpus.html 




 $160 if you're Canadian, more cause international shipping (gimme your postal code and i can do the calculation). 




 Don't need the watch - I like my traditional analog watches ;)

But I got a Gigabyte GTX 670 that's only 2 years old, still runs great. I upgraded to a GTX 970 last week, so looking to sell it. This is the model: http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814125423

It will work SLI with your Zotac, as they're both 2GB version. 




 Well it will be cheaper at least later if you want another card for Crossfire 




 Wow that CPU is way overpowered for your GPU. 

Get this one: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116942nm_mc=AFC-C8Junctioncm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-_-na-_-na-_-nacm_sp=AID=10446076PID=3938566SID=

With the $50 you save, upgrade your GPU to a 760 instead. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127744cm_re=gtx_760-_-14-127-744-_-Product

Otherwise it is a fine build. Sexy case 




 Dang they price corrected :( 




 Get this instead - substantial upgrade for $30 more: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814202080cm_re=290-_-14-202-080-_-Product

And 500W is fine if you're not using 2 cards. 




 See for yourself: http://ssds.findthebest.com/compare/574-632/Crucial-MX100-512GB-CT512MX100SSD1-vs-Samsung-850-Pro-1000GB-MZ-7KE1T0BW

TLDR: not really. 1TB one has better warranty, longer life span, and better random speeds (but that is very minor at this stage). 




 I am a game dev too, so I have 16GB in my desktop. I started with 8, and like I said, waited for RAM go on sale - which it often does. I'd suggest using the extra money to get the 290X now if you find a good price, then wait for RAM to get marked down in a few weeks for Boxing Day.

For Maya, Adobe CS, etc. 8GB is enough unless you're doing super heavy-duty stuff (like an extremely hi-res model of a Star Citizen-esque spaceship).

Unless if you need the RAM now, the 290 is still a great card.

Do you have peripherals already? 




 1TB is 62cents a GB. 512 is 40c a GB. The 512 is more economical - also if one drive fails you're not completely screwed. 




 Hard drive? SSD? Will need somewhere to store Windows + games.

And unless you really need 16GB ram (which is usually overkill), get 8GB for $50 less and use that money towards and 290X instead.

If you need 16GB, wait for Boxing Day when that kind of stuff (RAM, hard drives, small stuff) goes down 50% off. 




 FYI for those getting a 970, the FTW is only another $20-30 and has a significant overclock 




 980 if you have the money. Or 970 now and SLI later. Don't need a steam box; just get HDMI cable to tv, run Steam Big Pictute with controller. 




 Get a 1440p monitor and we got the same PC (minus the 2 SSDs) 




 Probably next summerish, I'd say a year's anniversary and we'll start seeing announcements about a transition 




 Hey Bart want to go play with the x-ray machine in that abandoned hospital? 




 At least Molyneux makes decently fun, albeit shallow games. Dean just made a shitty mod for a shitty engine then charged suckers like myself $30 to play. 




 Thats bullshit. Ive worked with NZ, AU and Canadian expats in the telecomm field and all he needs is a work visa. 




 He's an ideas man who abandons projects before completion
 If he can show me a finished game I'll regain consumer confidence in him, otherwise he can fuck off with his new studio. 




 Well I'll just keep these then 




 Did you overclock anything? What drivers? Can you take a screenshot of your settings and/or in-game FPS? I'm dying to get above 40FPS at 1440p 




 Far Cry 4 runs at 45-50FPS on ultra for me at that resolution and GPU

Dragon Age Inquisition even worse at 35-40FPS. How does Crysis 3 run better than DAI on my 970? 




 The new Runescape has a scary resemblance to Albion. 




 eve? darkfall? tibia? and you say AA is not close? dafuq? How has no one mentioned Runescape, the almost direct predecessor to Albion Online? Fuck, they're even similar in art and interface style.

 Awesome OP. I have, unfortunately, had the opposite experience on Balmung. Cliquey roleplayers, elitists and other snobs who completely ignore me if I try to roleplay or ask a simple question. 




 I did the tapestry thing on EA's website and had no idea what was going on LOL, so it may be a good idea 




 I own all three Dragon Ages, but never played 2 nor progressed far in Origins. Should I play them before Inquisition, or is the story not really related?

I loved how Mass Effect kept the same character through all three; does Inquisition do the same? 




 Aftermarket coolers can extend the life span of your CPU, overclocked or base clock. 




 Sold my account back in June when I saw them first changing labour points. 




 The game has good lighting...and that's about it graphic wise. 




 And DUST 514 




 [Yup](http://imgur.com/gKvVQLH)

edit: I like how OP is clearly a selfie, when his "GF" could have taken the photo 




 How old is it? 




 Nuuvem has it cheapest right now 




 If you get the buyer protection for $1 you get a guaranteed key or your money back 




 "oooh, ice creamville" 









 What's wrong with QNIX? I got one last week and it's awesome. Overclocked to 120Hz easily. Korean all the way from now on; so cheap and just as good. 




 Would an 8800 Ultra work? I got one of those too lying around. 




 I have a 2GB 670 for sale or trade (looking for the new dragon age or razer naga) 




 Samsung Syncmaster 2253LW and Acer G245HQ 




 [Because I'm a fucking idiot.](http://i.imgur.com/uH231bd.jpg)

[Here's what i got now.](http://i.imgur.com/dstoMOj.jpg) 
























 The adult face on the kid is throwing me off 




 I'm more interested in the political and scientific landscape now with the Reapers gone. That why in my continued edit1, the plot starts going into Metal Gear/political intrigue territory. 




 Shep never had a kid. The person you play in ME5 is the offspring of your ME4 character (who is unrelated to Shep).

ME5 they will be about 18 years old, while ME6 they'll be in their 20s. 




 I am a Line in the Cult of Kirrahe 




 The Prophet does not care for the Batarians. The appearance they have as Batarian sympathizers is just a cover. In secret, he wishes to cause strife by hiding within Batarian territory and attacking human and Citadel trade hubs, putting pressure on the Alliance to go to war with the Batarians for "harboring" a terrorist group.

In truth, the Prophet wishes a war to happen between humanity and the weak Batarians. He sees a void of power amongst the Batarians and believes he can manipulate himself to their leadership using political intrigue and immense biotic power. He is confident his adopted son will hold the throne and eventually, make the biotic humans into a new god-like apex race, with the Batarians as their slaves
 All other races will serve or die under this new galactic order.

His long term goal is universal conquest through biotics and spacetime manipulation - he literally believes his son will be immortal as no other biotic has displayed the son's amount of power.

Of course the Prophet dies in ME4. ME5 and 6 take place decades after and follow this adopted son as he grows up and befriends your player character (who is the unexpected offspring from your ME4 love interest). The Sons are dismantled in ME4, but this adopted son becomes an extremely powerful biotic who (by the end of ME6) has the very power to move suns and create black holes
 Albeit he is unstable by the end, the two games would focus more ln the consequences of your actions in ME1-4; as offspring of your PC in ME4, how do you deal with relationships? Will you be nice or antagonistix? Join a gang with your biotic friend, or join C-Sec? It will be about choice, growing up and finding oneself. 




 Hi all, I've been replaying Mass Effect again and have thought of an idea for the next ME4-6. Let me know what you think! I had the following ideas while doing my latest playthrough.

I just finished watching Place Beyond the Pines this past week too and thought "how come we never see the consequences years down the line of our choices?" Every RPG ends when the Big Bad Guy dies. The world is saved and that's it. Dragon Age tackled it a bit in DA2 and DAI, but it feels impersonal. You never see what happens to your character, his/her friends or family. ME2 tried it a bit as well, but apart from a few "Oh, Liara is on Illium now," it is not that fleshed out. What would happen if your character conceived with a love interest? Why do we take certain things for granted in a game like ME, like "where does this crazy biotic stuff come from?" I wanted to explore themes of religion, consequence, family  hope. So I hope you will enjoy reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it. I did get tired mid-writing, but I plan to write more.

~~

**Mass Effect 4**

We pick up about 15 years after Mass Effect 3. If you chose Control, the Reapers have finished rebuilding the Relays and have secluded themselves. Otherwise, the Relays were rebuilt anyways. You can pick your own race this time around. 

Your brother (or sister, if Asari), is a C-Sec officer on the Citadel. You get word they were killed in a large biotic suicide blast that has caused severe damage to the Presidium. Your sibling was scared, and believed there was an insider working for said terrorist organization inside C-Sec, so they turned to the only person they could trust - you. 

You are brought into the Citadel and take part in the investigation, having the only viable intel from your sibling. Your first squadmate is a Drell C-Sec offer named Roven (literally making names up on the spot), and close friend to your sibling. The bombing investigation leads you to a shipping manifest for materials used to make the same biotic-fueled explosive device. The manifest comes from Omega.

Roven used to work for Aria, and believes she may know who ordered the parts. 

Before you leave the Citadel, an aging, wealthy businessman (with a dark past) named Dondarion wishes to join you to avenge the death of his two daughters and wife killed in the explosion. 

Additionally, a Roven recommends tracking down Gaven, a Salarian explosives expert who may be able to help. After fighting through baddies who have taken Gaven prisoner for betraying a criminal organization, he agrees to join the team.

The Council gives you a small, cramped and rustic frigate called the Argonaut (a drastic change from the luxurious Normandy), for your trip. You now have a mission - track what group bombed the Citadel and killed your bro/sister.

If Shep helped Aria take back Omega, you arrive to find it undergoing reconstruction and renovation. Otherwise, it's a bit more worse for wear (like in ME2), but Aria still managed to retake the station on her own after Cerberus collapsed. Aria tells you the materials likely came from a renowned bomb-maker, a Blue Suns Batarian named Yosup. You fight through waves of Blue Suns merc before finally arriving at Yosup's compound. You defeat Yosup in a boss battle. You then ask him who ordered the bomb and then can choose to kill him or turn him to Aria. No matter which option you take, a human woman arrives and frantically tells you another bomb will go off on Omega. As she speaks, a violent explosion detonates in the heart of the city. Your party manages to survive as the woman shields you in a biotic bubble. 

The woman's name is Kolinya - she is a former member of a mysterious cult called the "Sons of Shepard." She had escaped and was looking for you. Back aboard the Argonaut, Kolinya explains the Sons of Shepard are almost certainly the group behind the attack. On the outside, they are a human extremist group of Batarian sympathizers. The founder is simply referred to as "The Prophet," is a powerful biotic human who left the Systems Alliance following the Reaper War. The Prophet left the Systems Alliance territory in search of meaning and stumbled across the Batarian religion, Vhar'shan, which preaches of strength and unity from [ancient Batarian scrolls.](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Kite%27s_Nest:_Pillars_of_Strength) The Prophet began intense study and came to his own conclusions that the Reapers were an apex race, but with them out of the picture, a void became apparent.

Kolinya explains the Prophet broke off from the main Batarian sect of Vhar'shan and started his own "Sons of Shepard." The Prophet believes that the post-Reaper apex race must be biotic humans. The end goal of the Prophet's beliefs, is biotic humans can eventually control the forces of the universe and ascend to godhood. The Prophet believes Shepard ascended to godhood on the Crucible and is the first of this new apex race. The Prophet, a powerful biotic, believes he will be the second to ascend. The Sons believe that the invisible forces of the universe chose Shepard, a human, to be the first of a new godhood which will rule creation. The Sons believe that mastering these forces through biotics, will allow them to join Shepard and rule all creation. They believe biotic powers have the ability to change the very laws of nature, therefore granting them the powers of gods. The Prophet concluded that the Reapers, despite their raw power, were unmatched to that of creation itself. What is a Reaper's laser beam to a supernovae, or black hole?

Kolinya shows the party a brief glimpse of the Prophet's preaching, in which the group recites their code: "We are children of the cosmos, the apex of creation. The Earth is our mother. The stars are our family. Our thoughts belong to the cosmos and with these hands we shall shape its destiny. Glory be unto the Shepard. Amen."

**Edit/continued 1:** With Kolinya's revelation, it becomes clear who the antagonist in the game is at this point. Your party must stop the Prophet before he begins a full-scale war between Batarians and humanity.

While on Omega, you discover Aria T'Lok was killed in the blast that has left half the station completely destroyed. You gain the help of a female Quarian bounty hunter named Jeema, who seeks the bounty on whoever killed Aria. 

The game continues in this fashion for some time, your party consisting of:

Roven - male Drell C-Sec officer. Similar to Garrus, he is a romantic interest for female PC.

Kolinya - female human biotic. A cross between a Liara and Cassandra (Dragon Age) personality. She is a romantic interest for male PC.

Dondarian - male human business magnate, on a quest for vengeance. He is a former smuggler and knows Zaeed Massani quite well. Possible fling with female or male PC, but no long-term romance.

Jeema - female Quarian bounty hunter. A cross between Boba Fett and that badass Tali. She is a romantic interest for male or female PC.

Gaven - Salarian explosives expert with eccentric personality. A bit of Mordin, Han Solo and Jack Sparrow rolled into one crazy package. He is not a romantic interest.

Over the course of the game, you discover there is an upcoming conference between Systems Alliance and Batarian Parliament leadership. The Prophet plans to bomb the proceedings and blame it on human extremists, hoping to instigate a war.

Your party arrives in team to stop the Sons of Shepard from blowing up the conference. As the members of government are thanking you, another bomb detonates and kills many. You discover the bomber, a rogue Spectre named Faraday, and he is not part of the Sons of Shepard, but is a member of the secretive Systems Alliance organization called SAICOM (Systems Alliance Intelligence Command).

Faraday says bombing the conference was necessary and will be blamed on the Sons of Shepard - his superiors believe a war with the Batarians is inevitable. Humanity needs a war with the Batarians in order to restart their economy following the post-Reaper recession. Faraday explains the Batarians inhabit many resource-rich worlds, but as the Batarians lack the technology or expertise to extract much of said resources.

The overall plan was to have the Player stop the Sons of Shepard from bombing the conference, as SAICOM knew they would succeed. Faraday therefore planted a *secondary* bomb that SAICOM *blamed* on the Batarians, in order for the Citadel races to be sympathetic towards humanity.

The Prophet was a former SAICOM employee who headed a project called BioHuI, or the Biotic-Human Inquiry Project. Faraday says the Prophet was originally going to be a human martyr - the public would rally behind a kind, caring biotics teacher if they discovered a Batarian was behind the attack. But the Prophet converted to the Batarian religion and was shortly fired from SAICOM, where he vowed vengeance and took off into Batarian space. 

The player then can decide what to do with Faraday; expose the truth, which would most certainly make humanity into the galaxy's black sheep. Or the player can hide the truth, thereby avoiding potential war and accept Faraday into their crew (as SAICOM believes Faraday died in the blast). An alternative is to still hide the truth, but murder Faraday. If you accept Faraday into your crew, he agrees to change his name and live under the radar.

**Continue Edit2:**

The player is now on the run from SAICOM agents, as well as tasked by the Citadel to track down the Sons of Shepard and eliminate their enigmatic Prophet. Faraday manages to locate the Sons headquarters - a large spherical station orbiting a Batarian red supergiant star. But the Argonaut is no Normandy - approaching the base directly would be suicide. Faraday proposes that the Player, Faraday and one other crew member pose as new converts to the Sons and infiltrate through a new recruit meeting, where you will see the Prophet himself.

The Player, Faraday and Crew Member get into the Son's headquarters and are shuffled into the main room. The Prophet emerges as a talking head on a TV monitor. The Prophet points out to the crowd of the Player's treachery and a fight breaks out. You battle your way through the Sons of Shepard base. The Player comments that many of the murals and depictions on the walls depict something resembling the Christian trinity - a "father," in the form of Shepard, a "Spirit", in the form of The Prophet, and a "son," in the form of an unknown young man.

You reach the end of the station to discover the Prophet had actually died many years ago, after the Reaper War. The Prophet now is a self-aware Artificial Intelligence, which seeks to control the universe through biotics. In its possession is an infant child, presumably the "son" depicted in the murals.

The Prophet AI, knowing full well it will be terminated, explains its origins to the Player if you have a high enough charisma/renegade/whatever.

Prophet was originally a man named Paul Sutton, a powerful biotic employed to combat the Reaper threat. Sutton worked for SAICOM, and was promoted to head of the BioHuI Project with the task of unlocking biotic abilities in children (very much like Jack and Cerberus), in order to combat the Reapers. When the Crucible emerged and SAICOM no longer needed BioHuI in its current form. SAICOM modified the Project's goals - unlock human biotics to help secure human dominance in a post-Reaper political environment. SAICOM believed humanity has a great chance of advancing itself to the forefront of politics, and biotics could help with war reparations.

Sutton became disillusioned with SAICOM, saying that BioHuI Project was just a cover for SAICOM's human extremism. "They are no worse than Cerberus, no more dangerous than the Illusive Man. Just now they have no Reapers to stop them and everything to gain," the PROPHET AI explained.

SAICOM fired Sutton, but that was not enough. Sutton threatened to expose SAICOM's extreme nature, so they attempted to assassinate him through a toxin. In a desperate attempt, Sutton fled and found refuge with the Quarians and Geth. But it was too late - Sutton knew he would succumb to his poisoning and, seeking revenge against SAICOM, pleaded with the Geth to upload his mind onto a machine intelligence. The PROPHET AI was born, with the goal to destroy SAICOM.

PROPHET rapidly learned more of biotics through its vastly expanded neural AI network with the Geth. PROPHET discovered the potential of biotic abilities - they have the potential to change the structure of the universe itself. PROPHET realized that the universe itself would end, even after trillions upon trillions of years. **PROPHET explained it's end goal was to stop death all together - both for organic species and the universe itself.**

"I would establish a new covenant in this creation - a perfect symbiosis between creation and life. With everything under my perfect command there would be no death, no gnashing of teeth or endings. Our universe would be eternal and perfect."

The PROPHET manipulated (or indoctrinated...) the first Sons, using Shepard as a religious icon to gather together the meek and desperate. PROPHET then bred himself a biotic son - a vessel unto which PROPHET could control the physical realm, while PROPHET controlled the digital.

The Player is disgusted by said revelations and had to option to destroy PROPHET through a virus provided by Faraday, or convince the AI to kill itself. Regardless, PROPHET becomes no more. The Player discovers the son, crying in a nearby crib. The Player can decide what to do with the child - kill it (in which case ME4 is effectively the end of the trilogy), hand it over to Jack's academy, or adopt it in secret.

Mass Effect 4 ends with the destruction of the Sons of Shepard base and the end of the terrorist organization. You are thanked by the Citadel. Finally, you are given the choice to oust SAICOM yourself, or let Faraday do it. Regardless of this choice, the Systems Alliance becomes embroiled in political scandal and war with the Batarians still looms as a possibility.

Thus ends Mass Effect 4. 

Coming up next in oodbot's trilogy, we'll explore the consequences of your actions. 18 years after ME4, your son or daughter, whom you had with your love interest (or off-screen lover, if none chosen), will be the Player in Mass Effect 5. What happens to the biotic, tank-bred boy? Will there be war with the Batarians? What happened to SAICOM? Was PROPHET correct - can one really control mass effect itself? ...and more in **Mass Effect 5: Generations.** 




 wow, thanks! 




 The only mods he should use are the texture packs 




 I love gaming so much i dropped out of uni last year and I start game dev college next week!! 




 I always go for Liara first - best squadmate for her biotic abilities. 




 Commander Shepard, assuming he/she has survived the Star Child encounter, is now living life as a recluse with severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He/She (let's just use "He" to save time) has gone off to live on his own. He has not seen his last love interest in years, nor ever fathered a child with said love interest. Shep has developed a drinking problem and (if male) has a gnarly beard because he doesn't give a shit anymore. He lives alone, reminiscing on the glory days; watching old vids, writing down his thoughts and replaying the events in his mind over and over (much like this very subreddit...).

Despite the destruction (which is the only ME3 end that allows Shep to live) of the Reapers, they still haunt his dreams every night. He remembers the death of all the people under his command; despite the trillions of people Shepard saved, he still feels immense sadness over the loss of loved ones (Miranda, Thane, those in the suicide mission, etc.).

In Mass Effect 4, set several decades after ME3, our player character is facing a new threat. He/She travels to Shepard's home - in a remote part of the galaxy - for assistance. Shepard offers some advice, but is too old and depressed to get off his/her ass to help. Shep, whos now this reclusive drunk, tells the player to give up. No matter how far they go to save the world, the world will slowly forget them and all their friends will die. All the killing and death will haunt them, so they should give up and go live a normal life and raise a family. Shep regrets being the saviour, as he feels isolated and elevated to this psuedo-demigod status where he is completely alienatesd from your average person. Most of his old squadmates have died of age, or gone off to do their own thing. He awakes every night, screaming of reapers and collectors, then cries himself back to sleep while trying to forget the next day with another bottle of scotch. Shep tells the player to forget him - he's a useless relic. He's just a man (or woman), not some invincible hero the universe has made him. 

Later, a main mission requires you to head to Eden Prime. Shepard volunteers to help - he wants to come, to finish off old demons. For one final mission, you play with the aging Shepard, as he battles valiantly through Eden Prime for whatever the particular objective is. You reach the spot where he first encountered the beacon in ME1 - where the entire series began. Your team is ambushed there. Shepard offers to stay behind, giving you time to escape. You eventually agree and escape to your ship with your two squadmates. Shepard stays where it all began and fights to the death. As he dies, he looks to see the escaping ME4 squadmates, but they've taken the form of his old crew. He smiles, then dies - peace at last 

If shep died in your ME3 playthrough...you get Garrus or some shit instead.

 




 You big stupid jellyfish 




 But why are they doing kickstarters? Did their other games not make enough money or something?

I smell bad business practices - you can't keep going from crowd-fund to crowd-fund. Learn to make a good game and set it at a profitable price point. 




 Are they doing another Kickstarter? Isn't Shadowrun Returns already a released product on Steam? 




 Because I believe in and follow Jesus Christ, I must be a science rejecting retard.

Thanks for the daily reminder, Reddit! 




 Quit being so fucking melodramatic. They're computer games. Grow up 




 Thank you Batman's Joker. 




 I think the red line indicates a type-1 civilization, or a planetary civilization that controls all the energy output of one planet. We're on the cusp of achieving this, through bio and geo-engineering. But if we don't stop our rapid over-consumption and disregard for the environment, and learn to work together, we may not make it past that red line. 




 For me it was: spend $400 on a 970 no one gives a shit. Spend another $400 on the same GPU for SLI...they perk an eyebrow then don't give a shit after 5 seconds.

You guys seriously are over-thinking all of this shit. No one fucking cares about your weekend or gaming habits. They really don't - they forget in 10 seconds unless you live with some overprotective mother (in which case, you're a teenager so who fucking cares) 




 Oh they will. OP is just a teenager who has never actually done a 5AM bar hop, and most people in this thread are also whiny little twats 




 IIT: 16 year olds who are making this into some sort of "deal." 

My bro watches 10 hours of football on Sunday. I game for 10 hours on Sunday. We both get equally chewed out by our parents for being lazy fucks, even now when we don't live with them

You guys sound so fucking whiny. 




 I got a huge panic attack when I went to Sagittarius A* the first time. I tend to stay near our home system too - I went to the edge of the universe once and completely NOPED out of there. 




 But if you met an alien you wouldnt know of they had a soul. How could you tell an alien "animal" apart from a "smart" alien? Our idea of intelligence is completly unique to our own human experience. To say whether an alien has intelligence or not is absurd at best, idiotic at worst.

What if they are a form of life beyond your human experience can comprehend? Some sort of multi-dimensional being, or a creature that communicates through a special kind of radiation? What if the very planet or stars were intelligent beings? It doesnt matter - they are beyond our capacity to understand and therefore, irrelevant to our salvation. Let God worry about the other entities out there. 




 According to the fermi paradox, an intelligent species should have evolved long ago and would have colonized much of the known universe (including earth) by now. 




 OP have you read any Stanislaw Lem? He deals with aliens in a more realistic and alien way than most sci-fi. I think your OP assumes aliens would be your typical Star Trekky or Star Warsish "humanoid" aliens, like the Klingon or Asari from Mass Effect.

Stanislaw Lem's novels treat aliens as entirely different entities - creatures so strange, so beyond our comprehenson, we cannot begin to understand, let alone empathize with them. In Lem's Solaris, the human crew finds out the alien they are studying is a planet-wide "ocean-organic," where each wave of this planetary ocean is actually a muscle contraction ( or so they hypothesize). The organism begins reading their minds and projecting their past, dead, loved ones into the world as ghostly abstractions. The crew starts going insane, but never in the book do they realize why the organism is doing this - is it communicating with them? Is this its way of speaking? Does it have goals or objectives, like a human would? What are those abstract shapes it creates with each [wave?](
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Symmetriad_3.jpg/250px-Symmetriad_3.jpg)

Lem leaves these things open ended in his novels. He is easily the master at creating truly exotic/alien life.

My point is that i don't believe the great commission extends beyond our own species. We don't preach to apes or dolphins, yet they show signs of intelligence. The organisms in Lem's novels are many millions or billions of years older than man, sgowing intelligence too, yet how can you begin to proselytize to such alien life? The core of Jesus' teaching is on love and empathy - how could I have empathy for the billion-year old, planet-encompassing nanobot alien in Lem's "The Invincible"?

 Done. PMing. 




 PMd for GPU. New Years Resolution is 2560x1440. 




 Want to latch onto OP - I too, need a 1155 MOBO, same CPU as OP. 




  I got fired, not for my lack of computer skills and repair quality, but for not selling enough. 

That sounds very odd. Our in-store technicians do shit sales, because they're in the shop all their shift, but management knows that so these guys have very low firing rate (the current main guy is 25, has been working there since he was 18). 




 I work at Staples Canada as a Tech Salesman, so Staples Business Depot (US) may be entirely different. I don't do much of the easycare (tech support) side of things, but I built my own gaming computer so I am pretty confident in my tech abilities.

But for what it's worth, Staples has given me the best job training of all my jobs thus far. I have worked as a telecom engineer, government data  inputter (wow that was exciting job), fast food, grocery stores...

Staples gives you excellent sales training, through role-plays, videos, product knowledge quizzing, etc.

I just posted my stories cause it's fun to blow off steam.

There is a Best Buy right near my store and I know a few of the guys there. They always say our customer service and training is 100x better than theirs and they would rather work here after finding out how shitty Best Buy really is behind the scenes 




  When I was in retail I actually preferred this kind of stuff. It was busy work that would help pass the time and made it easier to avoid interacting with people.

Yuppp. My thing is getting printers down from overstock. Get to rid the picker for an hour or two. 




 Staples Employee here, also work in tech. Similar stories to OP with a couple I'll add.

 Many customers think RAM is the be-all-end-all of computer hardware. The more RAM you have, the faster your computer/laptop will be, period. Some look stunned when I tell them they're 12-year-old daughter doesn't need more than 4GB of RAM (standard in any laptop now) for her school work.

 Customers paying for $2000 Macbook Pro's in cash, when you can tell they're living off government subsidy.

 Customer couldn't understand why his onboard laptop GPU wouldn't support a 1440p monitor when a) it simply did not support WQHD (I googled it), and b) he didn't even have the right port on his laptop. He was there in our store for 3 hours trying to make the fucking monitor work.

 Got yelled at by a guy who claims we sold him faulty monitor cable. Turns out he thought his DVI cable would work as an HDMI cable, as his monitor did not support DVI.

 No, we don't have that Boxing/Black Friday Doorcrasher in stock. Stop fucking whining. Get here at 7AM like everyone else.

I like to complain, but I will be honest that our store doesn't get that many idiots compared to the rest of the retail employee's I've met. 




 Only thing I'd change is get an SSD if you could afford one, otherwise looks great. Nice case 




  run triple 1440p monitors, hopefully 2 of the 27in korean ones, and one of the 34in widescreens from LG. 

Jesus.

Good luck.

 It's going to crush most modern games. 




 Yeah, we gotta try and get EasyCare Plans (ECP), applecare, laptop/tablet setups, etc.

The warranties are easy to sell on printers cause people break the damn things so often. 




 Staples worker here. Get the same kind of questions.

Today was good though - I converted a young (10 y.o.) padawan into a mechanical keyboard convert. 




 if you find a cheap one lemme know, bought another 970 myself. already own a 970 ftw. 














 egads, if only my mobo could do sli.... 




  BUY them at a store in Skyhold.

Please tell me how. I am overloaded with useless currency.

 if you do everything there is to do. 

Like collect 10 hides or return a runaway Druffalo? These are literally quests I'm encountering 20+ hours into the game.

The only activity I semi-enjoy doing is closing Rifts, since it's easy, combat-focused and rewards good Power Levels.

Let's take a look in my journal right now actually...

Kill 2 guys for Cassandra in each zone.

Kill Venatori agents for Dorian in different zones.

Visit a grave in Hinterlands for some asshole in Redcliffe Village.

Kill wolves near a farm.

Close 0/2 or 3 rifts (x2-3 for each zone).

Is this WoW or a BioWare game? I don't recall doing this mindless shit in Origins or Mass Effect. I know Mass Effect had some grindy, shitty MMO quests, but you could skip them and do the main quest right away without grinding power level. 




 No, the game requires you to get a certain "Power Level"^over^nine^thousand in order to access the next main quest. It's padded as hell with fetch quests and repetitive ~~Oblivion gates~~ [Rifts.](http://www.riftgame.com/wp-content/themes/riftgame_2013/library/images/RIFT-og.jpg)

In order to do some of the companion quests (e.g. Kill Dorian's Venatori agents), you are required to return to the gimmicky, cow-clicky War Table in order to open up more areas of the map. Fuck off BioWare, let me explore at my leisure. If an area is too hard for me, idgaf, let me die. 




 I'm on the second last main quest with 40 hours in. Don't tell me I haven't really started it.

Fucking idiots downvote me all you want; defend your overrated generic Tolkien clone that shits on Origins. 




 Because his writing while he goes "insane" is so fucking terrible. It's fanfic bad. 




 You may enjoy Pixel Piracy 




 Might want to avoid Inquisition after your first paragraph 




 I think a cool idea would be a Oregon Trail-style game where you play Moses leading the Jews out of Egypt. 




 Until the cringe-worthy final conversation 




 I never even beat Inquisition. Between the boring combat, fetch quests, empty open world, and shitty main plot, no desire to finish the game. Game of the Year, my ass. Aliens Isolation should have won.

 I just went back and have started another Mass Effect playthrough under "the man with no name...Zapp Shepard at your service." He womanizes and never prepares for anything. Looking forward to ME2.

Edit; thanks for the downvotes, ^fucking^idiots

I have 40 hours in Inquisition, more than my Origins or DA2 playthroughs. I am on the second last quest with no intention any time soon of finishing.

 Thanks for the link - the numpad is required though, since I do a lot of maths and excel stuff. I'll look around that site 




 I'd give gold if I could, well done 




 Hey we got the same ship :D I upgraded my Omega to an Avenger  




 Unless you have a peasantbox to sell, wait for the new cards coming out next year 




 I would like the Metal Gear Revengeance game

http://steamcommunity.com/id/toxilium/

Merry Boxing Day!! 




 No bring everything with you 




 I work at Staples and we have it for $30 too right now. Return the one you bought and re-buy it to get $10 back. 




 I had the 670 and upgraded to a 970 FTW for my new 1440p monitor. Its awesome, and only $420 canadian, whereas my 670 was $370

The alternative is SLI 2 670s which would be very powerful and arguably better than a single 970 for most sli-supported games 




 Those are both DVI ports. 




 Yes 




 Look at getting a 270x or 750ti 




 Does it have 2xDVI? 




 Get a third monitor or return it for something cheaper. 2 monitor gaming doesnt work as you would have the screen split in half 




 Best bang for buck is 970 - third best card on the market and only $350. 




 2xHDMI or 2xDVI 




 Unless you go big with the CPU (like some monstrous i7 or xeon) you won't see much difference. Save some money for a better GPU like a 970 




 What is your budget? 




 Get  280X for another $30-40 with the cash you save on the OS 




 You don't need that monster of a CPU. I have a i5-3570k overclocked and it was half price, along with my 970 I get 45-60fps max in Crysis or Dragon Age at 1440p. 




 Did you put them in the same color ports?  




 Bought my bro a chromecast. Mom loved it so much I got another for her iphone 




 F 




 I always buy the parts myself and my Dad says "Okay I will give you the monry back, happy birthday/christmas." 




 Is there a noticable difference between 1600 and 1866 MHz? 




 And I try to sell people my company's (Staples) full Windows clean and setup that is only 150, rather than spending $400+ on a new laptop they likely won't see a huge difference with if their old one was bought 2-3 years ago

I built my own PC 5 years ago, just upgraded GPU and another SSD, but a good Windows reinstall makes it seem like a new PC every year 




 Did you tell him he can download more ram? 




 If you find a 970 for around 350, no. The 290X is notorious for high power consumption, heat and cooling issues 




 I work at Staples in tech and have these people trying to buy i7s and 8GB ram laptops for their grandpa who uses it for email and web surfing. I explain they don't need that much, but I won't stop them from giving us more money. 




 And having the most RAM is the most important thing 




 I got a Dell XPS with the same i5 and other specs as a macbook pro but it cost $500 less. 




 Why?

 This is the worst assignment we've ever been on 









 MR. PRESIDENT! 




 YES! Take that, Bitterman! 




  I'm no pirate, but if publishers want to be assholes they can get fucked.

Fine by me. Developers think publishers are assholes too. That's they're job - they need to be ruthless in this market. Publishers are business men and marketers. They're not gamers. They don't care if the game is good, as long as it makes money.

The blame often gets shifted to the devs. While sometimes that blame is due, how can a developer make a great game when they're expected to produce Call of Duty # every 12 months?

 Basically: go fuck yourself if you are a dick. If not, and you don't make shit overpriced games, I'll give you my support.

Yes exactly. This is what I mean by "vote with your wallet." If you like a developer and like their game, buy it. Otherwise, move on. 




  I still want to play their games....so....

**TOO.**

**FUCKING.**

**BAD.**

You entitled little shit. It's not water. It's not air. It's not civil rights or freedom of speech. It's not something you get due to your very dignity of being a human being.

**IT'S A FUCKING VIDEO GAME.** It's a luxury the VAST VAST majority of people cannot even afford. Yet you feel you have the GOD-GIVEN RIGHT to PIRATE games, made with sweat, and tears and excessive amount of espresso? Give me a fucking break.

And fuck the twat that upvoted you. 




 Can I have one? 




 Picture looks like Neuromancer concept art 




 You can skip the weapon/appearance DLCs. While none of the DLCs are essential to getting the full story, I suggest checking out our sidebar to see which ones are the best. 




 Don't be a fucking asshole. Only fucking assholes pirate. I'm a game dev myself and piracy pisses me the fuck off. If it's too expensive for you, don't buy that shit. Vote with your wallet. Don't be a fucking asshole.

Sorry for the number of swears but piracy really pisses me off. 




 My monitor can go up to 2560x1440 




 Hey man, used to work at Staples in their tech sales and EasyCare department (where we fix people's computers). Now I work in the games industry.

For that kind of price you're much better off building your own gaming PC. For $900 you can build one hell of a gaming computer with an i5 and 290 or maybe GTX 970. That laptop has an i7 which is completely useless for solely gaming. i7's are designed to take on anything; unless you are doing video editing, 3d modelling or other high-end stuff, just go with a lower-priced i5 that will give you the exact same performance in gaming.

The main thing is the 730M GPU on that. It sucks, plain and simple. Good luck getting a decent framerate from ESO on low.

Another thing is that laptop has 1TB of HDD. While 1TB is a lot, you want to get ESO and Windows running on an SSD for WAY faster boot times. A HDD takes a couple minutes to boot, while an SSD takes about 10 seconds. Laptop manufacturers get away with putting cheap Seagate or Western Digital drives in laptops, as most people think "Wow, 1TB, so big!" When really, you can buy an internal 1TB HDD for around $30.

8GB of RAM is plenty. ESO does not use more than 4-6GB of RAM, even on my 1440p, ultra settings setup. Again, unless you're doing 3D modelling or video editing, 8GB is more than enough. I am a game developer, so I need 16GB in my PC.

The 15.6" screen is going to hurt after a while - you will get back strain and eye strain after looking at something so small. Take it from me, as I used to solely game on an ASUS 17" laptop (which is even bigger than yours). Once I moved to an actual desktop with a 27" 1440p monitor, I can never go back.

This build will destroy any game you throw at it. It will run ESO at 60FPS, 1080p, max settings very easily. And it's cheaper than your laptop. 

If you really need something on-the-go, just buy a cheap tablet on sale to access email and stuff. You're saving money with this build anyways. 




 What are you talking about? I see a massive drop in quality from errain's screenshots. I run at 2560x1440 and even going down to regular 1080p I see a big drop in image quality. 




 I am getting very bad lag and frequent disconnects, so it may be server-side thing 




 Mass Effect, with all DLC. Why? It gets "role-play" the best for a single-player game IMO. You really are Commander Shepard, warts and all. You get angry, happy, sad, depressed and joyful over the three games. The characters you interact with seem real and the stakes of your adventure, high. I have never been so attached to a virtual game character than I have in Mass Effect. 




 Lunch lady Dorris, have ye got any grease? 









 Don't touch my stuff!...Hey, this isn't the YMCA.

 Mmmm *falls through asphalt hole*....WOW...BART! 









 I doubt the artists involved wanted to do that, but due to Ubishit's time constraints, they have to push out a new game everywhere. There's only so much you can do in 12 months.

I am in modelling and character design myself; I could not stand to copy+paste a model in a scene, but when you're on a limited time budget, you gotta keep going to get deadlines. 




 Won't regret that in 60 years 




 I had not considered that, so fair point. 




 I had not considered that, so fair point.

 Or a stupid Shepard who just happens to get things done out of sheer luck. Never lead a team, never put yourself into harms way. When Miranda says "In theory, any biotic could handle it," make her do the biotic barrier. When Jacob volunteers for the vent, let him do it. Always let someone else lead. If you do need to make a choice, make an ill-informed one by tossing a coin.

Or you could play as a xenophobic Shepard. Never recruit aliens if possible. Never do alien loyalty missions, and try to get them killed. Be Paragon to all humans and Renegade to all aliens. 




 I just finished my complete DLC playthrough two days ago and I know exactly how you feel. I haven't even played any other games since finishing ME3...they all feel so inadequate (they're not, I'm just in post-Reaper melancholy).

It's like finishing a very good book, or television show. You invested so much time into the characters, world and story that you don't want it to end. Then you get sucked back into boring reality.

If you want another dose of glorious escapism, check out Dragon Age! 




 I am really hoping BioWare goes back to their roots from ME1 - a grand-scale, sci-fi golden age kind of plot. Big ideas, fairly science-based, and megastructures (oh baby, love dem halos and dyson spheres). Instead, it was changed into a modern-day action shooter. The new Star Trek movies, while okay on their own, did the same thing. 




 Couldn't have said it better myself. Well put. 




  it ran worse on my PC with everything on medium/low, despite me being able to max Inquisition and maintain 60FPS, though I can sort of forgive it due to its age, this happens a lot with older games.

Sounds like a driver issue. My 970 gives me almost 150 FPS in DAO while I get around 50 in DAI @ 1440p 




 On board with you enjoying DA2 the most - I was engrossed in both characters and story in DA2 more than DAO. I dislike DAI, so I won't even mention it here.

To me, DA2 felt like it had the most fleshed out characters, each with their own realistic back story. You were this group of ragtag misfits in a city going through sweeping societal changes. On top of your companions, the main plot was unique among gaming - it was the story of a city, a populace, rather than some hero killing everything in sight. It felt like a true epic, a game version of Les Miserables or Tale of Two Cities. 

Knight-Commander Meredith was an *awesome* character. Her writing, voice acting, motivations; her entire character was well done. I have yet to meet a more interesting character in Dragon Age. 




 I can believe DAI has a very high word count, as you have the main plot, the hundreds of quests and then almost 6 hours of party banter on top of that. And that's just voice acting. If we add in Codex entries, quest text and other written stuff...yeah DAI has a lot of writing.

But don't use "lines" when discussing writing. A line is arbitrary, based solely on the format the work is provided in. I have a big churchy-style KJV Bible and a little one for travel, then an even smaller (horizontally) one on my phone. The word count is the same across all 3, but the number of lines changes. 




 Shamalamalan quality twist 




 Well since you cannot provide an actual source, i.e. a link or video, I drummed this [infographic](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BGJpxZ2CQAAd2oN.jpg) up.

It says BI had 20k more *words* than an average novel, not pages. 20,000 pages is absolutely ridiculous, if not inhuman.

In comparison, the King James Bible has just under 2,000 pages with about 788,000 words.

 [Some classics are around 50-90k words](https://indefeasible.wordpress.com/2008/05/03/great-novels-and-word-count/), with some longer books being up to 175k. Let's say BI had 200k words. It still cannot beat a monster like Atlas Shrugged or War and Peace. 




 They can easily drum up new conflicts. Keep in mind the entire series has only been set in the Milky Way. Even Star Wars had an extra-galactic [threat.](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Yuuzhan_Vong)

I hope they expand more on the dark matter and biotic stuff Drew and the ME1 team were going towards. 




  what keep them from enslaving the galaxy?

If you didn't choose Destroy, get the Reapers to bomb Leviathan out of existence. 




  I'd prefer a sequel with a smaller scale story. But I trust BioWare.

I am all for the smaller story; I'd love a BioWare game with a very small cast (10 main/supporting characters) that have very fleshed out personalities and histories. Then you throw those characters into a personal, emotionally realistic and trying story for a great character-driven space "drama." 

But with the way DAI went, I am semi-pessimistic we'll get another Baldur's Gate clone (big bad, assemble team, do missions, kill bad). 




  Reapers are powerful, they can prevent every single intra-galactic war just by their very presence. It's easier to include geth/quarians, genophage consequences without having to drastically change the plot than including Reapers as guardians.

You can still get away with the Destroy ending - in lieu of the Reapers, the Council makes the Spectres a post-Reaper peacekeeping force. Or everyone is more happy with the Destroy ending so we don't have intergalactic war.

I think BioWare is going to go where the other games did not, or barely touched upon. There was a ton of background lore on biotics, dark matter and the sort that we never really delved into. I hope we see more of the galaxy since there are *billions and billions* of stars out there. Maybe a visit to the galactic core, or even another galaxy? 




 Many are saying here that BioWare wrote themselves into a hole with the 3 different endings. I disagree; I think if you managed to import saves into ME4, either through a "Mass Effect Keep" or a direct import system, you can still make a plot that doesn't stray much depending on Green/Red/Blue ending.

Here's how I would do it:

Red: This is easy. Allied races rebuild everything afterward. AIs are offline for a bit, but are eventually repaired as well with more checks and balances (e.g. Asimov's laws).

Blue: Again, easier than Synthesis. Shepard's makes the Reapers move to another reclusive part of the galaxy in order to avoid further hostility (who would want to live near a Reaper?). Everything else is rebuilt, like in Destroy.

Green: Probably the most difficult to write, but it can be done. The actual level of "synthesis" was never fully explained in ME3. Did organics just get nano-like implants, ala Deus Ex? Or is it so extensive, does everyone speak telepathically now as a collective "mind-hive"? If everyone were a demi-god AI/organic hybrid, you might as well make an entirely different game series set in the far, far future. However, if we take the former approach of "less" synthesis, it can still be done. You just cannot center ME4-6's plot around the organics vs. synthetics theme in ME1-3. Make it about something else, where it does not really matter if everyone has these neural implants. Sure AIs can empathize now and organics can interface with computers, but we've seen these tropes before in other sci-fi (e.g. Deus Ex, The Matrix, Neuromancer).

The skill of BioWare's writers will definitely be tested. They will need to get creative, as to differentiate itself from the other 3 games and not upset fans.

We're going into a post-Reaper galaxy; changing political and socioeconomic structures, highly advanced technology, and (hopefully) greater galactic cooperation. I would not be surprised if we saw more expansion on biotic research, or extra-galactic exploration/colonisation. Maybe an extra-galactic threat from Andromeda?

For now, I'm content with my own fanfic ME4 trilogy; a story about a highly advanced "immortal being" playing with human biotic potential in a bid to stop the death of the universe. 




 Got a source for that Bioshock Infinite thing? That sounds way, way too much. 




 Dude who just moved here too - been listening to Danny for years but have never gotten the chance to see him live. Would like to go with someone 




 No. 




 Clickbait at its worse. Who cares. 




 Didnt enjoy the story as much. Felt like a big DLC or companion novel instead of a worthy addition to the human-covenant-halo conflict (which is what Halo 1-3 was centered around). 




 He's been in a bunch of ads and in a major video game trilogy. I'd say he is doing all right compared to your average actor. 




 Deus Ex , Halo 1-3, and the game I am working on! 




 DAI is an unoptimized console port on PC. Hopefully BioWare will be more familiar with the engine for ME4. 




 Homer loves Flanders 




 He's gaining on us, go faster! 




 Then we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge!

You don't get these faces with the new animation :( 




 Nothing can compare to the imagination of a small boy. 




 It doesnt matter. 




 I'll make sure I get a better repost next time 




 I would have never thought of that. 




 Son, if somethings too hard to do its not worth doing. 




 I hope in the next ME we get more realistic romances, rather than this hero worship "pick the flirt option 10x to unlock sex scene" kind of fluff.

Romancing Cassandra in Dragon Age does not give me much confidence that romance will evolve in ME4 




 How are you finding Warlords? 




 *I should go.* 




 I've done every LI except Cortez and Tali. While Liara had the most content and is likely BioWare's canon love interest, Jack felt the least hero worship to me. Even Liara practically throws herself at you in ME1. 




 doh 









 What did you guys like so much about Arkham? I was never a huge superhero fan, so even after beating AA, I didn't get the hype. Haven't bothered playing AC yet. 




 Please put all your screencaps into one album, rather than uploading them all separately. 




 Dear friends,

I had the privilege to do my first complete DLC-included playthrough over this past Christmas break. Beforehand I've only ever played Mass Effect when I bought it, with or without DLC. I'll spare the details, but I had a very challenging 2014 and was very down in the dumps. 2015 is shaping up to be much better.

I am kicking off my "new year" (7 days later), with the completion of Mass Effect 3. I played a Captain Kirk-like (paragade) man-shep, romanced Liara in ME1 then, for a change, did Jack in 2/3. Jack is an awesome LI, if you have not tried with her already.

Anyways, I finished ME3's final mission tonight after doing the "energetic" Citadel party. After I chose the [green ending](/spoiler), I was still feeling a bit down when the credits rolled (which I played M4 Faunts overtop) and rebooted my save.

I played the entire party again as the quiet version. In my head, [this was heaven for Shepard after he died at the end of Synthesis.](/spoiler) Just kicking back with friends. What a perfect ending to the trilogy with Shep's whispered line "The best..."

Thank you BioWare for keeping me company over the Christmas break, and creating the best game series I've ever played. Here's hoping Mass Effect 4 is even better. 




 They do have hair physics - watch Morrigan's hair in any conversation and it's quite easy to spot 




 Because creating realistic hair that moves with the physics engine (Havoc, in DAI's case) is very difficult. Look at Tomb Raider 2013 - they had that special TressFX hair and it still looked really wispy. Even in photorealistic CGI hair still looks off.

What most developers do is put on a heavy layer of post-processing on hair or fur. If you've played Far Cry 3/4 or Lost Planet, it is very evident. 




 Care to expand? I don't enjoy the combat, as it's spammy, boring and MMO-esque. The animations and effects were pretty, but it's a pain to go through (especially that 3 hour boss fight at the end). 




 It's not due to consumer interest - it's because your subreddit was linked on /r/games and /r/subredditdrama over fanboy Dominoid's post 




 I've got about 100 hours in on my Deluxe copy. It was okay the first couple times to 50, but it gets old fast. The lore is a pretty dull affair and I don't remember any of the characters except the green hologram dude. 




 That's generally the phenomena with most games - the ones online are either disgruntled customers or rabid fanboys. The normal folk just enjoy the game. 




 They're meaningless, arbitrary awards from a random games website. They can give Dolphin Simulator 2014 best MMO and it doesn't change anything. Who fucking cares.
 




 Then you don't give an award that year, which is exactly what Massively did 




 When you pay $60+ then 15/month on top, then another $15 to get a fucking mount, you're going to defend a shitty purchase.

Just look at assholes like /u/T-Husky in this very subreddit.

ESO has a notoriously wank fanbase. Far worse than any MMO ive played. 




 RemindMe! 6 months

Edit as of jan21: hahahahahahahah. Fuckin right.

Edit 2 as of July 2015: ;) 




 You must be flip. Only flips complain about flips 




 Report, ignore and move on 




 Sarcasm? 




 The best thing in the genre was a mediocre expansion for a decade-old theme park mmo 




 Reapers got blown up. Relays rebuilt along with EDI. Geth in the process. Shepard survives, but is so distraught over his journey, he buys a small cabin on a far away colony to live in peace. He takes up drinking as a hobby and has severe post-traumatic stress disorder. His LI either died or doesn't know where Shepard went. 




 Most of the Elder Scrolls games do this fairly well. You may also want to check out Divinity; Original Sin 




 I don't know - the rest of the game writing is fairly good, as good as any Mass Effect (Citadel is awesome). It's mainly the Cerberus parts I have a problem with. I think it's something to do with games in general - they needed a "human" enemy for the player to kill, rather than just Reaper husks of the various races for 45 hours straight.

It was the same in ME2 - where did all the mercenary groups recruit hundreds and hundreds of brain-dead drones to fight Shepard? 




  I love the game,

I'm confused; you list several major cons with the game, but love it? 

Is it just me or do we overuse "love" in regards to products? 




 I think KOTOR1 was better; KOTOR2, unless you have a third-party mod, is a buggy mess with a terrible ending. 




 I got about 75% through DAI, got so bored I started another ME playthrough. Almost done ME3 and haven't even touched DAI since before Christmas

I bought Alpha Protocol and KOTOR1 like yourself, looking forward to them 




 Other than Hawke's inclusion being fanfic-y, I agree with you on every point. 




 I think DAI is a boring, MMO-esque grindfest for power level. 

But to each their own. Got about 35 hours in, third last mission and haven't touched it since before Christmas. 




 I am doing my second playthrough of ME3. I forgot how terrible some of the writing and plot holes are, but the biggest one is really glaring.

Why is Cerberus this massive force with unlimited soldiers, when in ME2 they were a small survivalist group? Why is Martin Sheen going on the all-out offensive, when before he used small squad tactics to capture highly valuable material? Why is Cerberus on Tuchanka? Why are they at Grissom Academy? Why are they on Sur'Kesh? Why are they fighting me more than the Reapers?

Don't get me wrong, the game is fun. Outside of Cerberus/TIM/Kai Leng (god he is fucking awful), the writing is fairly good. 




 If possible, try to use a flatter, wider nose. 




 Money. I wish they wrote his character better in ME3 too - he's such a [talented](http://static.rogerebert.com/uploads/movie/movie_poster/apocalypse-now-1979/large_xytHTHqtQlXtzyJTtlqnVjvDdqd.jpg) [actor](http://i37.tinypic.com/68g410.jpg), they could have done so much more with him. 




 An MMO should do one of two things - be honest and blatantly copy World of Warcraft, knowing full well it will never succeed World of Warcraft (WoW) - or create a sandbox where the players create the content (EVE Online). SWTOR, BioWare and EA foolishly thought to take on WoW's throne and they couldn't even make it up the first step before crashing and burning. All they made was WoW, with single-player KOTOR stories and some *okay* (IIRC) 16-player raids. They could have easily just created a Destiny-like game, or something akin to Borderlands; a story-driven game with player choice and some co-op.

BioWare could have easily created KOTOR with some multiplayer elements with the budget put into SWTOR. In fact, SWTOR was so bloody expensive [(estimates at $200mil+)](http://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-the-old-republic-cost-200-million-to-develop/1100-6348959/), they could have made a single-player KOTOR so vast, so epic in scope, it could have been their magnum opus. I think it was EA's interference that spurred the creation of SWTOR; they saw how successful Wrath of the Lich King and Burning Crusade were (the current xpacs at the time of development), and said "wow, people love star wars, let's just use WoW's formula and add Star Wars." Where have we heard that before, just in the last year with another popular single-player franchise?

From a game design and innovation perspective, most MMOs today are drastically outdated. Every single one is just copying Everquest's formula, World of Warcraft included. The only exception I can think of that takes full advantage of the massively-multiplayer environment is EVE Online, where by players run the economy and political structures in the game. 

We can argue that most games are built off previous games, as nothing is inherently "original." BioWare has essentially been remaking Baldur's Gate for the past 17 years. But that is what they're good at - creating interesting *character-driven, single-player* experiences. Not MMOs.
The MMO genre has been stale since 2004 - the year when WoW released and EVE was celebrating a 1-year anniversary. Unless you enjoy WoW, there is literally nothing else to play that is inherently different except EVE Online. Why would you play SWTOR, or EQ2, or ESO, or Age of Conan? They're all World of Warcraft, with some twists here and there, but they all fail to live up to WoW's amount of content, class balance, lore or player base.  




 The reversal of the Reapers from this enigmatic, god-like space cthulu machine race into loltripods from War of the Worlds.

ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL

I KNOW YOU FEEL THIS

BRMMMMMMM

Give me a fucking break. 




 So Mass Effect Galaxies? 




 Its got 8 self-contained stories that do not need any help from other players.

Why did they make an MMO again? 




 Probably wouldn't have Martin Sheen as a voice actor 




 I can see ESO nurtures a very mature, helpful community. This subreddit was toxic at release and is still shit now. Enjoy your shit game folks - I'll save this post and come back in 6 months when it goes F2P.*

*they removed 6 month sub options. why the fuck would they do this if they were NOT planning on going F2P?

Jan21 edit: http://www.pcgamer.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-drops-subscription/

Motherfuckers. Dam right 




 Wtf 




 How can it be anything but [M4 Part II by Faunts?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUKiOcV1SSc)

Halo and Journey have the best soundtracks though 




 Good luck getting to 120FPS @ 1440p for any recent AAA titles, unless you SLI 970s or something 




 It's rumored to be going F2P in a few months, so wait. 




 wtf? Did EA or Ubisoft go down or something? What is this shit, OP? 




 Now buy a QNIX for WQHD 




 If they were, they wouldn't still be in business.

blah blah, Ubisoft, blah blah. IIRC, many, many people bought Far Cry 3 and 4 and enjoyed it.
