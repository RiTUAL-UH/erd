 I meant to say humans lived with dinosaurs. 




   Seriously, I see it all the time. Every film with cavemen has them riding dinosaurs. In fact, 1 in 4 Americans think that Humans lived with Cavemen. 
  It's sad how anthropology is so misunderstood and underrated.
 




 What show is this? What episode? What program is that of which this poor fellow had to endure such trauma. 




 That was...that was...beautiful. 




 Will you be working with Chuck Norris? 




 Sounds cool. 









 Specifically ones in which the coding can be done from the iphone? 




 I have had difficulty finding a good game hacking subreddit. This subreddit pertains mainly to ethical and sometimes illegal hacking. So can someone direct me to a reddit about game hacking? 




 That is brilliant. 




 Specifically. 




 It's 2001: A Space Odyssey  




 Thank you, my good sir! 




 As in how did you create the flags? 




 How did you do this good sir? 




 Nice to be alone away from all the "EXTREEME HARDCORE PVP" 9 year olds, huh? 




 Why not have a nerd server for gmod?  
  It would be a sandbox server with one of those maps that have been multiplied in size by 4. 
  If we do decide to take my idea, all I ask is to be co-owner at least. 




 This is beyond fake. 




 It kinda reminds me how in real-life corporations evict people and tear down structures for their own mega highways.  




 How did the ender dragon attack? Did someone spawn it or what? 




 Is it due to the rules or because of the massive amounts of griefing sparked by Team AVO? 




 Sandstormed by Darude 









   1. Play nice. Try not to flame. Let admins defuse the situation.
  2. Don't post things that are retarded and unrelated.
  3. Post prehistoric content other than dinosaurs from time to time.
  4. No religious references. I have nothing against religion. I am quite fascinated by it. But "God/Allah did it 6000 years ago" doesn't satisfy our thirst for prehistoric knowledge.  




 Is that Tiny Tim? 




 He was merely upvoting a post. The arrowhead representing said upvote.

 Old minecraft. Especially the community. 2011-2012 was simply amazing because of minecraft. I remember during the winter it was thunder storming and windows were being smashed by hail, and I logged onto a server and I felt instantly comforted.

 I shed man tears 




 That's the movie I was originally thinking of! I couldn't remember the name. 









 Beautiful 




 Whose is the founding father of nerd.nu? Who is thee who stretches Reddit's empire to minecraft? Lol.
 Also, can I contact this person through reddit? 




 We've heard this story a hundred times. "Scientists discover new alien planet capable of supporting life!" People get hyped. No further research goes into the planet. The hype dies.   
  Anyone else remember Glise 581 from 2007? 




 They are planning something. As I said before, they are training on their server and talk of Ddos attacks and hacking an admin account are common. 









 Because, if you watched the videos I put links to, you'll see their massive numbers. Plus, that was only a small fraction of 4chan. Us Redditors have been a thorn in 4chans side, so some think they plan to launch a campaign. Plus they wouldn't stop at griefing, it would be followed by the hacking of admin accounts and Ddos attacks. 




 I meant nerd.nu

http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kQay4_FJU7E

Look at that. I'd say the 4channers are Gods of pvp. They remind me of the Spartans. 

  So what happens if they raid c.nerd.nu? 
It has happened before. Reddit's official server has been raided by griefers originating from 4chan. We, as Redditors, are really a thorn in 4chan's side. So what happens when they come for the server of Reddit: c.nerd.nu?



 




 How did he do it? Can someone list the commands used please? 




 Can I give a minecraft item (A hoe, specifically) the ability to shoot guardian lasers? If yes, what command can I type in? Also, can I do this on my multiplayer server?
 




 Well, Reddit has had lots of enemies and has had a lot of flame wars. I think it's important to document these flame wars as they were crucial to the history of Reddit, especially the big flame wars which have effected the entire internet, like the feuds with 4chan. 




 What websites and organizations of people have really just been a thorn in Reddit's side? Ex. 4chan and Team Avo? 
























    WE MUST GO AN TAKE 4CHAN BACK FROM LE TUMBLR AND 9GAGGERS!

   Would they have had the brains to do it? 




   Is the pricing flexible?

Can plugins like Element 3d work with it?
 
How hard is it to learn?

What are it's advantages over Adobe's After Effects? 




  Put the price difference aside. 
Let's focus on the technical advantages and disasvantages of each. 




   Would the homo erectus, neandertal or the denisovan been able to use the bow and arrow? 




  I'll start.

1.Things exploding that would never explode in real life. 




  Maybe a campaign to launch an ad on reddit? 









   Take the Tumblr-4chan Flame Wars of Independence day. A series of ddos attacks occured. But no arrests were made. Why? 




 4chan actually made me shed tears... 




 Link? 




  It's a seems like a really good software to start film-making.  









   A good code injector is needed.
 It doesn't have to be, but specifically one where code modifications can be made directly from the jailbroken phone.  














   Could be used like a war elephant I guess. I had this question when I was a wee lad and decided to post it. 









   Stupid question. It's quite a long story.  




 How do you fall for that? 




   They were pretty intelligent. They knew about projectiles.
We know that most likely none of them ever built or shot one.
 But if we put all of that aside, did Neanderthals have the intelligence and physical capacity to build and shoot a bow and arrow? 




 Just wondering. 




   Now don't get me wrong, there economic system was great. There was no such thing as poor in their society. They also were very good at making remedies for injuries and diseases and were skilled warriors. They survived against all odds. Now, I did't come here to argue over who is more developed. 
  I'm just wondering why was it that Europeans had gunpowder, more advanced science, advanced corporations and armies. They also had ships that could cross entire oceans and some of the Europeans had mastered the art of Gliding (People like Otto Lilienthal). 
 Why is it that they were technologically superior the the natives? 




  I would've preferred it if it was a 3d puzzle game. Something like Super Mario 64. 
 Pretty good visuals too. 




 It seems like it would be pretty chaotic. With the eruption of Toba and the impending Ice Ages. 
  Similar skirmishes probably happened when Homo Erectus, Neanderthal, and Sapien existed together 80,000 to 100,000 years ago.
  Homo Sapiens had the evolutionary advantage. They crafted bow and arrows, which were devastating weapons back then. 




  It's not saying there was a prehistoric LOTR style war between species, 
I'm just saying it is theorized that humans fought Neanderthals which might have helped killed them off. 
  
 




   My favorite theory for the Neanderthal demise is the one where it is thought that humans helped drive the Neanderthals to extinction. Some sort of inter species war. A battle for resources and land.

   I heard border collies really go crazy if you don't give them something to do. I'm worried my pooch gets bored when I'm not home. Border collies are dogs bread for work. They love work, even if it's a simple task. So what activities or "jobs" could my Border collie do? 




 I asked r/ vfx, but I want an answer from a larger community. 




 I don't understand the pricing system. I pay 495 upfront, then what? 
(I plan on buying the commercial version.) 









   Greetings Reddit, I think I'm done. 
I can't take it anymore! I have no one to talk to!
  I'm such a loser, one of my teachers has a strong disliking towards me, I live in my cousin's shadow, and my dad was never there for me...
  One day at school, I had had it. I was gonna do it. I tried to tell myself that I was being irrational. 
  I went to the counselor. They called my mom. Rather than being supportive or consoling, she got onto me for telling the school, saying that they're going to label me.
  I wanted to talk to my dad, but he is overseas. He doesn't give enough of a care.
  I have no one to talk to. I'm a popular guy, and have many friends, too many to count, but yet, I have no one to talk to! 
  My parents and my friends are only concerned for themselves. It's always them, not me...
  I can't tell you how many times I've been cheated out of birthday celebrations, or have never been called by my dad. 
  I can't do it Reddit!  




 How would this abandon all of that? 




   I've been on minecraft since Alpha. I loved it. I grew with it. I was 10 at the time of classic. Oh the fun! 
  Everyone hates the updates, and so did I for a while. But I'm starting to like them. I think horses and the armor stands give minecraft a medieval feel. 
  What is your stance on the updates? 




   We need them. C.nerd.nu is stuck in the olden days without them. With slimeblocks, we can create flying machines. We can venture into the skies of minecraft, we can safely venture into the void. This is the final frontier... 




   I feel like the community is dieing. I don't want Minecraft to end. Minecraft is a beacon of hope in the hell that is the gaming world, it is a fresh page that stands out against the all the "GUNZ BLAZIN COD FPS". 
  Minecraft doesn't feel fun anymore. It feels like it's dragging with all the recent updates. What do we do? I don't want minecraft to die! 









 Oh my god op... Give us the seed or instructions how to generate a world like that! 




   Tell us about the greatest things that have ever happened on vanilla servers. For me it was this battle we had against a guy who created this army of mobs. He built a fortress literally IN the layers of the farlands. This was beta of course.
  Tell us your vanilla nostalgia stories and feel free to list the ip to a vanilla server in the comments: 









 Thank you for the advice! 




   Hello my good comrades. I'm 14 and am interested in that of a filmmaking career. I want to create top-notch effects, to do this, I feel the only professional tools for me would be The Foundry's Nuke. The thing is, this costs $4000. I've had this dream of becoming a filmmaker for a long, long time, since I was a wee lad! 
  My parents won't allow me to work a real or summer job just yet, so what might I do until then?  




   I'm about to be 14, and would like to have a career as a filmmaker. I want my cgi to be top-notch. I want it to be so good, it gets featured on the Cgbros YouTube page. So, I would like to aquire a copy of The Foundry's Nuke. The thing is, this software costs about $4000. My parents won't let me get a job yet, so I've turned to r/beermoney. Being an avid user of the subreddit, I saw how someone went to Vegas on their "beermoney", so if they can go to Vegas, I can get Nuke, how hard can it be? Harder than you think my friends...Vindale looked very attractive, but my hopes were dashed when I found it charges you for the products you test. I turned to swagbucks, which promised $35 per survey, but my hopes were crushed yet again when I realized these offers are only to reel you in, after that you get a survey every two months for only $0.02.
  I need advice. What might I do? 




   I want to start a career as a filmmaker, to accomplish this, I'm going to need to get a copy of The Foundry's Nuke. This vfx and compositing software is used in every film from Gravity, to Star Trek, to Transformers, you name it, Nuke is in it!
The thing is, this software costs about $4000. My parents don't really want me working a job yet, so what might I do?
  Being an avid user of r/beermoney, I've always wanted to try a bunch of paid surveys, and maybe in 1-2 years I could get the money, but I'm afraid of scams, so I really need some advice! 














 Did it get taken down? It was from 2010 or 11. 




 I downloaded an app called badoo, put my profile as a member of isis, messed with people, someone legitametely called the police. I am in Texas. 



















   It's turning into an rpg. 




   He played Saruman. He could be a great Herobrine.
"There will be no dawn...for Minecraftians!" 









 Also, does the student version give you watermarks and only let you render in less than HD? 














   Say I torrent a music creating software and publish my works and make money off said works, is that illegal? 














 Saw this on /3DCG/. The question was, "If I used a pirate bay torrent to download The Foundry's Nuke (A vfx Software) and use it to create little short films like FreddieW on YouTube, would it be illegal if I used Google Ads and made money off of the videos I created with the software I downloaded with a torrent?"
 









 I see places where you can find after effects, MODO, Cinema 4d and all those goodies for sometimes half-price, but are there any good places where you can find a copy of The Foundry's Nuke for $2500-1000 at least?
 
























 So could I perhaps use the equation y=16x+62. It's a linear equation, and I need to graph it. 




 Can you explain just a tad bit further? 




 The goal is to create a scenario which can be graphed using a linear-function. 
  My scenario is "Poncho Villegas is a soldier who needs to capture a fort. He needs 600 troops to do so, and currently only has a company of 62 soldiers. He receives a platoon of 16 troops each day. How many days will elapse before Poncho has the required force to conquer the fort?"

How might I solve this? I am having trouble puting this in linear function/equation form. Help me, r/ Homeworkhelp. 




 Wow! Nice to know someone is as interested as me in this effect! Do you have a video tutorial? 




 Low quality pictures yes I know, please acknowledge these were taken with laptop cameras. 









   I have seen Tron and Tron: Legacy. I always loved the derez effect. Whether it was evaporation or programs shattering into thousands of cubical vowels. 
  I have also seen a few episodes of VGHS, and the derez effect is also pretty cool. 
  If you were creating a movie which has a plot centered around a vidya gam or a computer, how would you recreate this effect? 




 Wat 









 Kinect 




   Could you use it for motion capture and then somehow port it to Maya for animation? 




 Wow! I know what route I'm taking! 














 Alright, what about this.

I really want this site to be legit. I am looking for cheap prices to buy After Effects, 3ds Max, and Autodesk Maya. That is my dilemma. I want to buy these usually expensive softwares for $150-$400. 




 It is certified by McAfee though. 




 It was tested with McAfee though. It looks legitimate.

 Oh. Might you be able to clear these misconceptions up? All I want in my vfx work is photorealism. 




 Wow! Might I inquire what software you used to create 3d models in this wonderful render? 









 I really thought Tau Ceti was a good candidate? 




   Seriously. Every comedy related sub has a rule against memes and rage comics and posting such on a social network is considered "shit posting." 




   It's basically a cheaper version of Maya. I'm assuming it can render simulations? 




 Thanks! 


































   I think it will be around $200. 




 I'm sorry good fellow, but I do not believe there were any birds (Assuming you are denoting to the branch of Archosaurs) in the videos I had seen. 




 What might you mean, good sir?

 When I right click, it selects each of my objects. I can't move them anywhere unless I want to move all of them. 




 I suck at character modeling. How did you get good at it? 




 Blender kicks ass at creating stuff like planes and materials. But sucks at character creation. 




   If we had a good list of links, it would be good for new users like myself. 









 I'm using AE, blender, and maya. And I don't feel like cycling through softwares. I was impressed by element 3d.  




 Great man. Thanks 




 Just wondering. I need a renderer. 




 Usertesting is pretty good. $10-15 per test. 




  Also, what other sites could I use? 




   I saw someone who did a speed modeling video where a guy modeled a gun based of an image which he had in the background really fast. He could chose a polygon and stretch it out in less than that of a second. I'm thinking he just uses keyboard shortcuts, for that's what people do in Blender speed modeling videos. So, what keyboard shortcuts do I use to do such? 




   Can I just import my models into renderman and then use muh shaders to render it out? 




 Alright. So how do you do the "sped modeling" thing? Where one is able to stretch and select polygons very fast in blender or Maya? Do you just use the keyboard? 




   I saw a video where a guy created a 3d model off of an image? How does he bring the image in? How does he change the size and select shapes of polygons so fast? A simple explanation would be great? 




   I want my reader to feel sadness and anger. But I feel like killing characters to often becomes cliched and gimmicky. What are some tips, r/ writing? 









     I've worked on a few vidya games which was pretty cool, but I was completely sapped of creativity. We used CryEngine, and I realized how similar it looked to CGI movie effects. I started comparing films to video games.
   I asked myself, "How can a film be more interesting than a video game if a video game is so interactive and keeps the player on the edge of their seat?"
     Anyway, long story short, what are some nifty writing and editing tricks to keep the film vibrant, exciting, and interesting? 









   I was thinking Christians would feel good because you know, your hurting Satan, the ultimate sinner. Yet games such as the Diablo trilogy and Darksiders have created controversy. 




 Looking for a place to download the engine used in Quake. I'm designing a retro game. 




 Does anyone know where I can download the engine used in Quake 1? 
I think it's id tech 2 or something. Anyway, I'm making a retro game, so if y'all could help me find this engine, that would be great. 




   One side of the planet would always have day light, another would always have constant darkness. 




 Okay? Where do I start? Where do I begin making an agreement with Nintendo?
Also, do you have to own a company to become a dev? 




    I think R/ Nintendo would know better than anyone else. 
I know you need to have an agreement with Nintendo, so where do I start?
 How do I acquire a devkit? How do I publish my game for the Wii U? 









 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5AvCxa9Y9NU
  
  Seriously. They're releasing two games in 2015. I'm worried for CryEngine.  




 Voxel farm is a Voxel engine. You make shit out of billions of tiny voxels. The more voxels, the better and more round a model can be. This is supposed to solve the problem of games not being able to render enough polygons. 
  With voxels, you can have unlimited detail, and according to Euclidean, not have to worry about hardware specs.
   So I'm trying to find an equally good Voxel engine without jew prices. 



















 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4SUNWOVxVmk

  I'm a cryengine dev, and I want to know if my tech works with Wii U. 









   Seriously. Valve doesn't know what the consumer wants. We have our standards too high. If Half-Life 3 came out, what would you want? 









   I haven't seen any good one in a while. Working on a film and need some good footage for inspiration, btw.

 Will I be able to do waking cycles with characters? 




 So can I make boids walk in rows and formations, then interact with other boids and particles like in LotR. 




   I model in blender. Must I uv map in blender as well? Or can I uv/box map in Element 3d and then texture the model all inside AE? 




 And what sort of solution is there? 




 I'm trying to do a lotr scale battle. How do I get them to walk? Also, is there a limit to boids? I want to render several thousands battling several thousands. 









 I'm just so worried about vfx for my films. 




 Meaning it will expire? 




   Does it have all the features? I see these all the time. 









 Basically I want to do a large scale battle sequence. Maybe a few thousand agents fighting each other 




 Damn that is pricey! Maybe can I just create multiple simulations and then composite them later? 




 Massive software? I noticed you capitalized Massive so is that a crowd simulation software? 




   I'm thinking of thousands of agents. I have a powerful computer.  









 Is it possible? 









 God dammit I just want a dirt cheap/used version of autodesk maya. 




 What does that mean? 




 Original equipment manufacturer. Meaning the software comes without the fancy box. Meaning it is sold at a significantly lower price. 




 Appon.us sells OEM VERSIONS of autodesk software at low prices. I for one, think it's legit. 









 Why does it look shady? 









 Appon.us 









 Yes or no? 




   I wanna composite green screen actors into a cgi matte as well as add cgi characters. The thing is I'm new. So give me some tips and tutorials? I have element 3d, by the way, so just consider that.

  Yeah. Why do we take our children to see the latest flick? Why do teens flock to movies like Guardians of The Galaxy and 2014's TMNT? Why do we watch movies? Why do people care? The answer is the reason why we make a living out of this. So, I ask again, why do humans watch movies? 




 I have both, and am looking to create photorealistic renders, do I have enough? 









 In terms of photorealistic rendering? 









 Deus ex machina? As in the god? Can you elaborate? 




   I'm very intermediate at modeling. I'm just about a pro. I can texture and UV map like nothing. But sculpting, oh sculpting, I just can't! 
   Where are some tutorials to get me started? All i can find are tutorials introducing the tools, I want a tutorial which shows me how to sculpt something like a character. 
Please help, r/ blender? 




   I came up with a story about aliens who create the human race, but have to fight hostile aliens to do so because said hostile aliens want to prevent them from creating humans due to humans destructiveness which might lead to their downfall. 
   The thing is, this story is pretty generic. What to you scifi readers and viewers, makes a story outstanding?  














 X+y+z=15
2x-y+3z=-15
-x-y+z=-7
(Hint: solve for z and get two equations to have x and y only.)
  I don't know how to use this with subsitution. The best way would to. E to use process of elimination. 




 Thank you so MUCH
