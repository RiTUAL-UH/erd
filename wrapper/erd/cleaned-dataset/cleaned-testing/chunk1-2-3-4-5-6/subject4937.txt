 I see your bad sweaters and raise you this: http://imgur.com/cJ3Sc 




 This is Jefferton's finest family. 




 Yes, it was staged. We decided to break free of tradition this year with Christmas pictures. To give a sense of before and after: http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/c0.0.403.403/p403x403/12607_447747458619863_115113246_n.jpg -- What fun it was walking around Kmart to get to their photo studio though. 









 oh, usually saw that. was sorta in my own world after reading this... tnx 






























































































 Wow--haven't really heard of anyone using Future Point's Starlight anywhere and I talk to quite a few end users. Going to have to do some research and see how they're approaching unstructured data. Just curious (hey, you said you were bored haha), other than the scaling limits you've hit with Starlight or is that all?  




 Hi, all I meant by vanilla was the raw open source distribution of Apache Hadoop but from what it sounds like that wouldn't be a good fit for you anyway due to some of the overhead and need to just hop in and experiment.  









 "You need to understand computation" ... thanks for that.

I am talking about cost and feasibility here, not possibility.  




 Let's you and me revisit this thread in a few years ;) 









 It's that we reaching the Brick Wall of Moore's Law. There are only so many transistors we can pack on a chip and with those comes some serious power/cooling overhead that negates (by far) any savings on the hardware. 




 Maybe, but maybe not. There's the Moore's Law issue I cited a moment ago, and the cost of powering a system like this expected to increase. It's not feasible for anyone to own one of these unless you're a research institution (like DOE Nat'l lab--not hospitals). It was a cunning play from IBM to show the applicability of HPC technologies in everyday settings but it's far from practical. Unfortunately too--imagine what would be possible with a HAL treating us! ;) 




 I am curious about what made you guys choose InfoSphere Streams over vanilla Hadoop (complexity, learning curve, functionality) when from what I can tell this is the same core Hadoop framwork (down to the HDFS)... Just when you get time, know you're looking for an answer but I'm just curious.  




 I think that Watson's role as an instant "second opinion" from a "doctor" is going to bode well for medicine in general. The issue is that only the most advanced research hospitals (who already have the most outstanding researchers/medical pros) will be able to afford a system like this. Right now the IBM System Z line is more than many universities can afford--getting it into actual hospitals is going to require some hurdling over Moore's law--if you can afford the hardware, the power and cooling for this puppy will kill you. Could be many thousands to run this each month. 









 And they said R couldn't scale. Bah! 




 Okay, fair enough. I like yours better. 



















 Perhaps Iceland should understand this issue and offer a more attractive option to conduct business there on site but as it is, it's pretty expensive to do anything. And besides, not sure anyone (even the most hermit-inclined sys admin) wouldn't be willing to move there. 


































 Yes, imagine that. Doesn't usually happen that way. 



















 Great quote... "data science is a very fuzzy term, but what seems to unite a lot of people is that is theyve come from a lot of different directions and ended up in the same place. It almost feels like this crossroads where a lot of different disciplines actually meet and share and exchange tools and techniques and talk and collaborate." 




 Thank you for rewriting SnapLogic's PR for the enjoyment of all, PanderDaily. :) 




 Mortar actually seems like a pretty interesting service. Hadoop as a service itself is going to be the next wave of services in general--all enabled by AWS (because who really uses any other cloud), I just wonder how the message about such companies is going to resonate with actual users. It's hard to wrap a "sell" around that, especially for those who've already dumped a lot of money/time into teaching a team Hadoop or getting hooked in with a distro vendor. 












































 You know, I know better--and somehow, in my hurry to share it, speed got the best of me. This is a terrible error. Just terrible but it was up and I was off--forgive me!  




 Ha--awesome feedback, that! 


































 Great, well-written story 



















 It seemed for a while like they were keen on pushing some boundaries with their APU but NVIIDA and Intel so strong on the co-processor/discrete GPU front, why bother, I guess is what they thought. Thing is, AMD developed a great deal of this well in advance of Intel--they just do a pretty shitty job of marketing. 












































 They just updated it with full confirmation--China is now far, far above the rest of the world in terms of its supercomputing might. the Cray Titan system at Oak Ridge Lab is a rather distant second... http://www.hpcwire.com/hpcwire/2013-06-02/full_details_uncovered_on_chinese_top_supercomputer.html?featured=top 




 Xeon Phi is really only meant for the high performance computing (supercomputing) market. At least at this point. It's real push seems to be on its lower end Atom-like chips. 




 An update was just posted a few moments ago next to the older ones. The editors secured a special draft report directly from Oak Ridge National Laboratory and are expected to share full details about peak performance numbers (as confirmed) as well as full specs for benchmarks, application range, processor to coprocessor ratio, memory subsystem and ooo...the interconnect topology. Exciting stuff for the supercomputing world. They note they'll post this around 11 p.m. Eastern or midnight. 



















 Wow--that summary (and its companion alliteration) is a better title than any of the others kicked out there so far. 









 That is a wonderful smile--brought one to me today. 





























 That would be...unexpected. 




 Thanks for the explanation Big Pervert. 




 Agreed--I respect that argument and agree that there are some Christian scientists that are....science-y. Still not sure how they pick and choose what to believe based on faith and what to believe based on reality, but to each his or her own. Thanks for calling me on that because you are right. 




 Yes, it's sort of like going to Salt Lake City to drink and gamble, but nonetheless.. 




 I always shy away from CSM because of the name of the magazine, but honestly, they have some damn fine reporters that aren't all....christian-y. As counterintuitive as it may sound, their best reporting is often on science. Go figure. 





























 Baaaaa-dass. 









 It's hard to find things to give to friends that aren't sappy or generic. After searching for a while I decided that I could never express both humor and happiness with Hallmark junk. And so, yes. :) 









 My first thought upon seeing this... "Florida" 



























































 agreed--but tanzania--lots of other great things to be found that actually are worth quite a bit. 




 It's a DOE lab. Expect the basics. But if you like to read, which can be hard without video or pictures, it's a great article. 









 This system that another oil company (Total) is actually even more powerful, although not by much. And remember, these are just the beasts people KNOW about. http://www.hpcwire.com/hpcwire/2012-02-14/sgi_to_deliver_2.3_petaflop_system_to_total_s.a..html 









 I guess I didn't realize that something directly from one of the major national labs was not going to be acceptable.  









 Agreed--Jasper Chert. Which by the way, just solved my problem of what to name a minor character is a story I'm working on. Thanks! 




 TACC is adamant in this article that it's NOT at all involved with the system itself--that the technology is distinct from any Dell involvement..not sure what is being hinted at. 




 That patent that's listed is one of three they have to their name. Seems to be the only one that connects to what TACC has going on. This blows top supercomputer IOPS out of the water... 









 Can you use a toothbrush to expose it a bit more and offer a pic with better lighting? 




 Fantastic fossil hunting. Some great Devonian (I think) era coral and shell matter. 




 Agree on the chert--where was this found?
 









 Hi--thank you! I feel silly, but what is this cakeday thing people talk about here? Is that an out of touch question (ha!) 




 Yes, my nail (with effort) will scratch it... 




 Hi there! Yes, I think I have found two different answers through /rockhounds. There is an ongoing fight (via someone else's similar specimen) that it is either barite or selenite. It is indeed very heavy for its size--translucent (slightly smoky) spires vertically oriented but with a few horizontal "bars" of yellowish running throughout. No blacklight here, sorry. 




 Hey, I didn't downvote you--I actually upvoted you...what the heck? ... I appreciate your help! 




 And the slinky wave is entertaining :) 




 I did a google search for selenite after seeing your comment about that below and it doesn't look like this either. Here is my specimen photo, similar to OP's - found in Denver, CO http://imgur.com/mm3dUCk  




 Incredible and beautifully displayed... 




 Thanks for adding this--why isn't this commonly given as a form, I wonder. Is it that it's an uncommon form do you think? 




 Hi, i am inclined to agree. I just posted a pic in /whatisthisrock of the exact same stuff--down to the yellowish stripe--that I found in Colorado recently. And agreed, doesn't look like barite as I see it elsewhere. I'll follow this thread closely to see what they tell you. 




 Can someone help me ID this? I have done some research, a few options but still not sure. Thank you! 









 Can you help me ID this? http://imgur.com/mm3dUCk 

Thanks, all! 



















 Google+, is that you? 

















































 Looks like a concretion...So yes, probably a natural sedimentary formation. These can be tricky because they often look  "purposeful"....neat find, lucky you on the arrowheads 




 Well, they've removed it in this offering--this is what makes the Flex system what it is but some people, from what I understand, decided that Flex was too locky for their tastes--they wanted to have flexibility on switching, mgmt, etc... There is an SDN feature here too but it's not been explained thoroughly--or maybe that's something that's coming soon (like the GPU, Phi, direct water, etc)... 




 If the server market numbers from IDC and others is any indication--people DO want these. The question is, would they want them from IBM when, as mentioned in the article, HP, Supermicro, Dell and others are going to stick it on the price (not to mention the flexibility--i.e. for now it's just Xeon E5) -- It's hard to see IBM competing in the "made in China" wars but this does seem to be where the server market itself is going--Open Compute-inspired, stripped down systems that are purpose-driven and free from the cumbersome crap (like Platform's workload mgr, etc--things included here)...

All server makers on the HPC side are confused. 














 Also--now pretty sure it's shale with the ripples. Did a fair bit of research--all signs point to this. But this thing isn't part of the ripple. Has the hard shiny (after wearing down) parts on the "bones" of it but not anywhere else. 




 I have something similar--it is shale and has lines in it from fossilized mud/ripples. It seems to break in odd places so sometimes it looks like something more interesting than it is. I have broken a few of mine, sanded others down, but only one appears to be really interesting/have something unique (in this case a foot/print). 




 I am not as smart as you--can you tell me how you're so certain so I can proceed better with my own research? Thanks! 




 I just uploaded some photos of other similar pieces I brought back from the same location (all in one area about 20 x 20 with nothing else like it around--I've looked repeatedly).

See here http://imgur.com/a/LH9zc 




 That looks about right... 




 Also, these came from the High Point area-- 




 Well, hello neighbor--I am in High Point. Found these in one giant patch of similar thick rocks with ripples and brought many of them home. They were in a MOST geologically strange location--crystals unlike I've seen a couple of (seriously) amethyst points. Never seen anything like it. 

These are not stromatolites for sure. Got a bunch of those already--these things are thick, like layers and layers of ancient mud. I will take a few photos in a little bit to give you a sense of what some of the others are with my tiny, tiny hands as scale (ha--seriously).

Love the Pteridinium but this thing would have to be many yards long and there's not enough regularity.

Pics coming in 10 minutes or so of some of my other hunks. Again--weird locale. Amethyst points (2), an emerald, and what appears to be citrine. Not sure what to think. 

Okay--off to photograph for you! 




 Thanks so much for taking the time and thought to send the link and ideas. I have a number of other pieces of this "fossilized mud" stuff that look somewhat similar to the pieces there, but they are VERY thick. Some of the pieces are 6-8 inches thick, others thicker. It looks like this (which I found after a long search for anything similar) http://getoffourplanet.com/?p=3603

The weird thing is, the "bones" in this are black and much harder than the surrounding rock. It is possible for me to clean around it and those remain. Afraid to do so until I know more.

To answer your question, there is no curvature to any of the chunks I have--the link above is almost exactly what this stuff looks like. Oddly enough, there isn't anything clearly visible that's fossilized in anything other than the deep ripples (which incidentally, when a big one broke, the ripples go all the way through--completely 3D).

I am so glad you sent that info. It helps me keep an eye for other exciting things in the vicinity! 
 




 I found a number of pieces of fossilized, dark mud in a riverbed in central north carolina. Surrounded by some of the most perfectly formed quartz points I've seen around here, to boot. Strange place... Most of the fossilized mud pieces are straight or slightly wavy lines. Light sanding tones them down. But under these "toes" or whatever they are it's black hard rock, different than what makes these up. Can anyone help me ID? I am new to this... 
























 The paint likely wears off. 




 Booked like the rest of you but will certainly give it a shot.  









 They can add it to my list. 




 Cool, thanks for the pointer 









 I wouldn't call it an egg. I'd call it a run of the mill, porous sedimentary rock that is easily stained by iron from other rocks (and yes, possibly rust/iron/impurities in the water). But it's likely not coming from the inside of the rock. And again, it's not an egg. 




 I got mine at Cabella's--they are for fishermen and yes indeed, these are certainly something you want to try on before you buy. They're not cheap but they'll last a lifetime.  




 The handiwork of iron... 














 Cherokee National Forest area is a great place for finding things. Sometimes you can get permission from local land owners (pay them $20) to let you roam their lands. People have huge parcels out that direction and always need some cash. I bring the dog and off I go. 




 Glad to upload some when I'm home again in a week or so :) 




 I realized as soon as I hit enter that yes, of course it's metal...ha. Not plastic, not glass (certainly)... 




 Cool find--the antiques sub has a lot of specialists in certain areas, that might be a good place to ask. Is the lid metal or what tripped your detector? Not the glass itself, right? 



















 *rubs hands* -- thanks for this...will explore this evening 









 I marvel at your incredible fortune at finding this bag... Can you provide some closer shots of glass vial stones. Not sure they are diamond but would like to see closer. Where were these collected? You probably have no idea/backstory, do you? 




 My bucket list just got a little heavier... 




 North Carolina is known for its precious stones. Emeralds in particular. Also an abundance (relatively, of course) of garnet (almandine for the most part); Hiddenite (only found here); ruby/sapphire (lots but not a lot gem quality). My favorite finds in NC are amazing quartzes, some of which are clear as glass and as large as my hand. Most of these found in Western NC.  




 Or resin...quite honestly in the right casing, it looks like stone. Can you scratch it off with a needle? 









 That's what a call a flower vase with a backstory ;) 




 I live nowhere near WA but just spent a solid 30 minutes learning...very informative site. I wish all states would have such a by mineral/by location resource. 




 So what are they then? Can you share once you've paid your people off so people can learn? That's why a lot of us are part of a sub like this, after all. 




 Thane of Cawdor! 









 Well, that was a very pleasant virtual walk in the morning. Lovely. 




 Ah--you answered my other questions in one neat sentence there--who is it aimed at. Do you have a site with more details? 




 What kind of performance drag is expected for the complex simulations? 




 Ah...fond memories of playing CyberMorph just came flooding back. With awful memories of the dentist. I am conflicted. 




 This would be the equivalent of collecting everyone's used (loser) scratch-off lottery tickets in a pile and double-checking them to see if there are any people who decided going back to the store for their $2 winning wasn't worth the effort.  




 I am waiting for someone to say "slag" ... 




 Any and all tourmalines, hands down 




 It looks like a tiny leg, doesn't it? Nice piece--these are best cleaned up with a stiff toothbrush and warm soapy water. You can "file" them down a bit this way as well and expose more of the crinoid--I have many of these from the great lakes region. 









 Is it magnetic? Also, photo is not good quality but does it look glassy? Cleavage "swirly" or angular? 




 Oddly enough, over by the airport there are some construction sites that are abandoned. I found some great barites, geodes and other great stuff similar to this. I was just there for a work trip but rockhounding me--had my ride leave me off to go search through the dirt first. 




 What a great little piece of land they have. Unfortunately the larger photos of their recent finds aren't showing. Beautiful piece though! 




 These look a lot like those that can be found in abundance around Boulder (aptly named) Colorado and the surrounding area. Cool! 














 Would be helpful to know where they were found for the fossil one at the bottom...these look similar to some small marine specimens that are common in the Great Lakes region. 



















 Thanks! Is there a certain curvature or other feature to keep an eye out for? I am nowhere near Utah but I will be near other places smaller ones will be found. Your insights very valuable, thanks! 




 Incredible finds! How did you ID them at first (were they partially exposed, etc.?) 














 Need some size reference for one thing... 







































 Berkeley. I'm sorry, but this is one of the most common errors and it's infuriating. It's Berkeley. 














 Incredible summary--thank you so much for taking the time and thought!  




 Haven't been there but my favorite in Old Town is Miner's Gems. They have a lot of very fine stuff to browse--higher prices, but higher quality.  




 The only ones that are "easy" to polish by hand are softer sedimentary rocks. You'll have quite a bit of trouble with the obsidian by hand, even with the toughest of all sandpaper. Actually, one of things that has made polishing more fun on the ones I do by hand is using diamond files. They sound expensive--it's just synthetic grit with a handle. Much quicker and more fine-tuned than sandpaper or a sanding sponge. I have many crinoid and coral fossil specimens in a softer matrix and they clean off very well with diamond files. I cleaned matrix from a garnet (garnet schist) with the diamond files well too. 
























 I agree--I've seen a few similar crinoids from northern michigan pieces I have. They often look like something far more interesting when cemented in at certain angles but that's what it is. 




 This is quite old and wouldn't work, I am imagining, for the few systems there are, which have custom languages developed already (D-Wave's systems anyway)... great find though! 









 Based on your other finds, which are all marine, I would agree that that is a large scallop. 




 Beautiful--where is this located? Generally, that is? 




 Given the low quality of the "silver" material I would guess it's glass with some additive. These are common everywhere. If someone wanted to show off a piece of even non-gem quality sapphire they wouldn't dishonor it with that mounting. 




 I have not had luck with these in a tumbler and don't recommend it. What's really fun is hand polishing these--very rewarding if you have the patience and some elbow grease to spare. 




 Agreed, lucky, lucky you....this is a dream find. 




 This is one of my favorites of any posted here. Never seen it before...doesn't look real (although I know it is). 









 Sir Terry Pratchett made one. This is a rather badass thing; digging up his own ore and working with an ancient metalworking expert. http://gizmodo.com/5643189/sir-terry-pratchetts-meteorite-sword-is-the-closest-we-get-to-excaliber 




 It looks like a highly polished stromatolite. The only strange thing is that the edges are rounded off as much as I would expect if that were the case. 









 Intel has been clear though, to their great credit, that onboarding is easier than with GPUs. Still, actual users of the first-gen Phi say that optimization is still a very long process--sometimes in the end just as long as porting code to run on GPUs. The upside is that when they do that they by default get better performance on their regular Xeons.  




 NVIDIA is afraid...in this space (at this point for this particular type of large-scale systems that MIC was drawn for). They owned the concept of accelerated large-scale compute but the addition of on-package memory, the ability to swap between coprocessor/plain Xeon is the only thing like it, and they have the x86/programming ecosystem. CUDA, OpenCL are great--NVIDIA GPUs offer way higher performance, but the ease is the real crux here.  




 Xeon Phi has only ever been a coprocessor, the point here is that it's the first processor ever to do both at the same time. It can do both--and on top of that, be programmed roughly the same way. GPUs or other accelerators require offloading and serious code hassle. When Landing hits the ground there's no more of that--and it all leverages common x86 binaries, etc. -- The 512 aspect is a minor point. A MAJOR point is also that this thing has memory on package--another first. People don't realize what a game changer this is--for users and Intel alike. Right now it's just important for highly parallel applications in HPC--in 5 years, this will be the new face of Xeon. A serious rival to other contending architectures (ARM +GPU, for instance). 




 Yeah that likely didn't come from NC.... 









 Can you let me know what state/region this was found? 


































 See, when I see something like a sink buried in the middle of the woods posted here the "backstory alert" clangs. Those grim, grim possibilities... Or yeah, they just didn't want to pay for the trash pickup. Far less interesting story prospect. 





























 Found something similar near Apache Junction AZ some time ago and indeed it's hematite. 




 To be honest my first (grim) thought was that it might be a ceremonial object for covering grave dirt. 




 There is some serious backstory here. That's all I can say. What's on the coin? Does it burn your fingers when you touch it? *shiver* 









 "Hush a bye baby" -- my god that is a chilling discovery. And very awesome. Congrats. What country/region? 












































 Well then it's definitely from the moon! Congratulations! 

















































 There is a certain sense I get among the supercomputing elite that Hadoop is technology for Web 2.0 companies, that's there's no relevance. It's an unwillingness to experiment. That seems unfortunate because most of their workloads look a lot more like big data analytics (they would cringe to hear that) than they do strict floating point stuff. SDSC is the only real center where development work on this is actually translating into real applications being run...and guess what, they're running more efficiently. 
























 Yes, it's a big European event, from what I've been told. I'm only considering because I'll be at ISC the week before (and already overseas). Had planned on working in some other travel but not sure if this is going to worth the time. The technical program is quite solid--lots of involvement from CERN and research agencies there.  









 Out in Oregon where all the folks are building their massive datacenters (not supercomputers, to be fair--but just as many cores), this is becoming a huge concern. At some point, they're going to have to move to greener pastures (literally)... not sure how this issue isn't at the forefront of people's minds--don't even see anything about it in the disaster recovery space much. Yet meanwhile, look at the situation the whole West Coast was in... not to be dramatic about it, but this is a growing concern. 


































 Yeah, can't blame you there--and I think I've heard the same general statement more than once in the last couple weeks. 





























 The top one with the vertical lines is a typical horn coral--looks like you might have some crinoid bits throughout in addition to the shells. Nice finds, though. The one your brother found is pyrite--sparkly but common too. Still a nice start to a budding collection. Try to check out the area around you there in Ohio for trilobites and other semi-common fossil specimens, they're all around if you know where to look. Here are some day trip ideas http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/Portals/10/pdf/GeoFacts/geof17.pdf 




 *rubs hands together and cackles* -- between stacked memory and Volta, it's going to be quite a year, 2016. 

















































 Actually Jeff Squyres is their MPI guy and writes some great stuff. Not a thing to do with Cisco or pushing any agenda. Talked to him at SC in the past and he just really likes what he does, even if his company doesn't invest a lick in HPC. 














 To be fair, they did carry the other side of the debate here just a couple days before. http://www.hpcwire.com/soundbite/toward-realistic-quantum-computing-measures/  









 This is one of the best rockhounding posts I've seen in a couple of months. Beautiful, big finds. What area of CA (county) were you in? 




 I think that's his main point--he says it in the recorded part of the interview at the bottom that even with a top system, without experienced programmers who can optimize their codes, it's all useless. With GPUs, Phi, etc... at least having a familiar programming model is a benefit for users onboarding their apps quicker than with say CUDA 



















 Jade (green) and common quartz 




 Agreed, they are quite beautiful to look at but not entirely uncommon--great find, however! 









 Wonderful--I love this! What tools do you use for your carving?  









 It's only 9 a.m. but I'm already sure that's the coolest thing I'll see all day. Where is it from? 














 Possibly a pink Smartie? -- Posting photos is a must here...hard to say anything without one. 




 Agreed here. I have several similar pieces (some next to crinoids or with horn coral intermixed) from the Petoskey area of northern Michigan.
