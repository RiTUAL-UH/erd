 I am so sorry! I am also a Canadian from Nova Scotia. I seen this video on another site and wanted to share it on here but the link wasn't that good so I just searched for a good legit link and posted it without watching. Here is a mirror for you my Canadian brother! http://www.ebaumsworld.com/video/watch/84587718/ 














 There there.. Mr. Tusk... 
























 Have you seen Maniac yet? Its recent and probably one of my favorite movies now! 




 I will admit its bothering me too, I never noticed the error but I can't edit it unfortunately. My thanks for your appreciation though good sir. I seen this tape mention in another posts comment section and thought it would fit in here nicely. 

RIP to those poor kids though :(

 Play kids laughing or a crying baby on speakers late at night so they can hear. Probably the creepiest thing you can hear in the dark woods imo. 




 Creepy face thing to the right and behind her 





























 Wow, really? Did you know them before they got "famous"? 









 As soon as I seen it I knew r/Cringe would appreciate it
