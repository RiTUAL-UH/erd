 I appreciate you taking the time to write.  She knows I wouldn't do anything with her friends.  I think it's more that she was really open with her friends (which she usually isn't) and it backfired.  So she's even more closed off now and feels super insecure and judged.  Most of her friends are trying to make her feel better about it all, but the few that she used to trust have ruined it.  I personally talked to each of the ones that were being forward with me and made it clear how I felt and whatnot.  One of them even went so far as to feel my crotch while we were talking and beg to see it.  Needless to say, she was a quick 'unfriend' on Facebook. 




 My girlfriend told all her friends how well-endowed I am, and now several of them are being creepy, hitting on me, and doing other things which are hurting our relationship.  She's usually very shy, hadn't been with another man before me, and told them during a friend's bachelorette party not thinking my size was that big of a deal.  Some sort of bacherlorette-based Truth or Dare game.  


She's really embarrassed now and thinks she's ruined the relationship with me and with her friends and questions her friendship with the girls that have been forward with me.  (I continue to tell her that she did nothing wrong and that the friends that are hitting on me cannot be her close friends if they continue to do this.  You cannot be friends with those you don't trust.)  I can tell it's really affecting her view of our relationship. 


Any suggestions on how to reassure her?  She's convinced she's ruined everything and feels really uncomfortable around her friends and doesn't always enjoy being affectionate with me anymore.

 Yea, you hit upon several of my assumptions, especially the fact that she's likely to associate certain feeling of guilt with me no matter what.  So we'll see how it goes.  She's not the first girlfriend I've had an abusive childhood.  They always say they feel safe with me. 




 You're welcome and thank you.  Peace would be nice. 




 She seems to be improving.  It'll take time.  Thanks. 




 They're not repressed memories in the sense that the trauma was so great that her brain hid them away.  She just never dealt with the pain and emotions of the memories which swim through her head daily.

Just thought some of you might be curious as to what happened after my post.  After it seemed nothing else would help her feel better about what happened, she decided to use a counseling service through the university where she's working on her PhD.  (since it's a free service)  After a few weeks, the sessions began unearthing dormant issues of molestation and other terrible things from her childhood which the counselors are convinced are the reasons she has these debilitating feelings of guilt and shattered trust.  I encouraged her to focus on those issues without worrying about our relationship and we ended up going on a break.  I had suspected there might be something akin to molestation in her history, but I never brought it up.  Hopefully more counseling will help.

 Ha, confidence and swagger seem to be aphrodisiacs, yes.  I'm not worried about women who hit on me when they know I have a girlfriend.  I can swat away flies.  Just looking for ideas on how to make a shy girl feel less embarrassed. 




 Yea, but just a few of them.  And honestly, the ones that I couldn't understand why she was friends with.  Mostly girls from her high school days who she doesn't hang out with much anymore (or any now). 




 She was actually very proactive initially, messaging everyone trying to be light-hearted and underscoring that what she said was a secret just amongst friends, then I started getting messages from girls that weren't there. 




 The women that were forward with me would generally be the ones I assumed would be cheaters.  The ones that seems a little bit more selfish, narcissistic, and impulsive than the others.  Also virtually all of them already had significant others. Not a fantasy to have my girlfriend consider ending the relationship because of embarrassment. 




 I appreciate your words.  She lives off my reassurance, but the problem is she has to think about it every time we're intimate since my manhood reminds her of her guilt and mistrust in her friends. 




 The running joke with my girlfriends is that size doesn't matter but it certainly can't hurt... unless you're as big as me. 




 Grazie. 




 Yea, I'm confident things will return to a healthier level of comfort eventually.  I believe it also has much to do with how her public and private lives collided.  She feels exposed.  Just trying to see if there are other shy girls out there who can see things from her perspective and offer some ideas on what might help her see things less negatively.  (and also help her not be so PTSD-esque when she's being intimate with my manhood.  it stirs up memories of feeling betrayed by her friends) 




 It's actually a reoccurring problem.  Previous friends of previous girlfriends have tried to get me to have sex with them.  (Unsuccessfully.)  And the reverse has definitely happened a few times where male friends of mine (who obviously aren't friends of mine anymore) tried to get my then girlfriend to sleep with them.  It always seems to start with Facebook.  A friend of my girlfriend will friend me and occasionally IM me to see what's going on and start getting really chatty and friendly.  Perhaps I shouldn't list Secretary as one of my favorite films.  That seems to give them an icebreaker. 
























 When discussing his favorite films since he started directing, he said The Matrix was his favorite before he saw the sequels which 'ruined the mythology' for him.  I consider the sequels strangely sub-par films compared to the original but am curious what specifically do you think he meant by them ruining the mythology.


I'm looking for specific examples/themes/etc pertaining to the mythology set up by the first film.  Thanks!


Edit: Grammar/clarification.

 For kicks, here are the single frames between the cut..


[Before](http://i.imgur.com/qJEE7OP.jpg)


[After](http://i.imgur.com/JnL0yTk.jpg)


And here is a better angle of the bone a spin or so before the cut.. [Better angle](http://i.imgur.com/LfWFuRt.jpg)  ..Though obviously, the bone in this frame doesn't 'touch' the device.  The misaligned angle bone, so to speak, DOES 'touch' the device in the frame.  Perhaps this is one of the reasons it is used.


Also, notice the vertical antenna (or whatever it is) on the device just after the cut.  Curiously, it's slightly misaligned with its base.  In the next frame (and beyond), it's attached.  Here is the second frame after the cut..  [Second frame after cut](http://i.imgur.com/6iFjGxd.jpg)  ..Maybe a transfer issue with the DVD?  Unnoticed special effects flaw sort of like the helicopter blade shadows in The Shining? 




 As you can see, when you slow down the scene and/or watch it frame-by-frame, you can see the angles do not line up, which could have easily been done with a few less frames.  Since Kubrick was a known perfectionist and quite in control of every aspect of his films, it would seem he purposely ensured they were not lined up. (Perhaps to symbolize the road of technology was imperfect?)  What are your thoughts?

Since there were so many questions and comments before, I thought I'd let you all know that we ended our relationship.  She's continuing with therapy.  After talking with me over several weeks, we've concluded that it's best if she is not intimate with men (for the foreseeable future).  She's always been bisexual, but becomes very anxious when thinking about intercourse with a man now, but says she still wants to be with me.  She thinks she can overcome the feelings she has when she's intimate with me, since she loves me.  Over time, I was able to convince her to move on.  She's been with women before, but hadn't really been consensually intimate with a man besides myself.  Her studies are improving now, and she's getting healthier.  We'll be fine.

 State the subreddit, then the initiation. 




 1.  Everyone has plenty of time to flee their area as it sinks very slowly, but the land's sinking is non-reversible.  Plenty of time to save movable objects, personal items, relics, certain masonry works, etc.



2.  Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, and Syria's lands do not change beyond Jordan acquiring plenty of beach property.



3.  Though the land sinking is a far-fetched, absurd idea, the thought exercise of thinking about the land and the people is an important one.



4.  You can address any issue that comes to mind.  The people, the geo-political ramifications, the refugee statuses, reactions of other countries, the idea of a holy land, Zionism, conspiracy theories, etc, etc.



I ask this question seriously and look forward to you thoughtful answers.  Thank you. 









 I would secure more international financial backing and a firmer distribution strategy before directing it myself the same way that Coppola directed Apocalypse Now and The Godfather.  The script is the book (and radio broadcast transcripts) with my notes in the margins.  CG would be sparse and hidden with purposeful in-camera tricks and props.  Casting would take several months with some favoritism toward lesser known performers of unusual backgrounds (puppeteers, acrobats, interesting speech impediments, etc)  The entire movie would be shot in the UK if possible, though some exteriors may need to be shot elsewhere.  I would hire a towel expert to find me the perfect towel prop.  Absorbent, trustworthy, and intergalactic.   I would film it the way I first envisioned it in my head as an older child.  With all the gloomy bright colors, characters played straight rather than silly, Arthur more as a square always trying to pretend he understands what is going on rather than just a (babel) fish out of water.  He has more depth than just a simple 'where am i?' arc.  I would shoot the film partially on Super 16 Color Reversal Kodak film and other settings of the film in other formats to get different saturations of the different atmospheres.  The UK portions would be filmed in a similar fashion t I, Claudius and the BBC's Hitchhiker miniseries.  I would deaden the contrasts between them a bit as to make it less of a gimmick.   Before shooting, I would bring my script (the book and radio transcripts with my notes) to various accomplished Adams lovers in academia and the acting/writing world and get their take on it.  Holding reading sessions on various scenes with famous improv actors to elicit new takes on the material.  It would be set in the late 70s as well.  Also, i would not take an enormous directorial/writing salary, though I would let my agent work on that.  There is enough material in that little book to make a hell of a funny/intriguing/enchanting/superweird/remarkable movie.  Just need to hire the right people to get my vision onto the screen through a rigorous, well-planned path I have planned.  (Also, may need a mud expert to get that bulldozer mud juuuuust right). 














 Can't trade picks or draftees.  Just five players to add to your roster.  Have fun and show your work. 









 Board game, card game, DVD game, dice game, miniature game, RPG, etc, etc.




Just the absolute worst game that is currently in your collection (however which way you determine what 'worst' means for you).




For kicks, tell us why it's the worst and why you still own it.  Have fun!  :) 




 Key element is you get **one vantage point**.  You're not physically there, but you sense all your surroundings.




For instance, you can be on the grassy knoll during the JFK assassination 2.5 minutes before he's shot ending 2.5 minutes after he's shot.  Basically your senses are there for a **360 degree vantage point experience**.




**You cannot alter history**.  You are intangible, ephemeral, ethereal, and imperceptible.  Think 'Being John Malkovich' but without having to be inside someone's head, and you don't end up on the New Jersey turnpike afterward.




You are just sensing the 5 minutes through sight, sound, smell, taste, temperature, etc from one single point.




The single point can move with a person, object, vehicle, comet, etc.  Your senses are 'harnessed' in relationship to one collection of mass.   For instance, you can be in JFK's motorcade in Dallas, a fixed point in front of Neil Armstrong's helmet that moves with him as he takes his first steps on the moon, or just beside an asteroid as it flies past a distant planet.  




**Thus, mention the specific place you'd be as well as the 5 minute gap.**




Have fun!  (Edited for clarification.) 




 So with Roger Goodell's comments about Los Angeles and London, it made me wonder which other cities might be added in the future.



The NFL could add four more teams and go to three divisions of six teams in each conference, but I love the idea of adding eight more teams to have eight divisions with five teams apiece.  Realistically, eight expansion teams would stretch the NFL quite thin, but it's fun to contemplate the circumstances and invent new teams.



Feel free to move the Jags to L.A., change Buffalo to Toronto, move teams around divisions, change the name of the Washington franchise, or anything else you want.  It's your hypothetical NFL.



If you're feeling extra ambitious, write out the divisions, locations, and team names like this and specify which are newly named, moved, and/or expanded teams...

 As for the story itself, it was entitled "The Dancing Fool." Like so many Trout stories, it was about a tragic failure to communicate. Here was the plot: A flying saucer creature named Zog arrived on Earth to explain how wars could be prevented and how cancer could be cured. He brought the information from Margo, a planet where the natives conversed by means of farts and tap dancing. Zog landed at night in Connecticut. He had no sooner touched down than he saw a house on fire. He rushed into the house, farting and tap dancing, warning the people about the terrible danger they were in. The head of the house brained Zog with a golfclub. - Kurt Vonnegut from Breakfast of Champions
