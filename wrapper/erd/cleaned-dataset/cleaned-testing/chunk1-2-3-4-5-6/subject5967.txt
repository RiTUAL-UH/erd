 Should we spot start Lincecum for Hudson's next start? Best case scenario he just needs rest.  




 If we're going to be successful in the playoffs, Hudson is going to have to step up. Depending on how tonight goes, I'll either be feeling really good or really bad. 




 Nasty curveball. I ain't even mad.  




 Even she's tired of the Jeter circlejerk.  




 Even though you're right behind us in the WC standings, I can't bring myself to root against you. Hopefully we win the west and you guys can take care of the Dodgers.  




 Depends on what you want to do. For night life, the Gas Lamp, Pacific Beach and North Park are the main spots. The Gas Lamp is even cool during the day and it's within walking distance of PetCo. At night, it's a little showy, but a lot of fun. The trolley runs there, but it stops around 11:30. Pacific Beach is great at night too. It attracts a younger crowd, a lot of bros and hoes. Cabo Cantina will have more 21 year old girls than you'll ever see again in your life. You have to drive there though. North Park is the most laid back spot. It has a super hipster vibe. If you go here, be sure to check out Seven Grand and True North Tavern. 


During the day, I recommend visiting a brewery. San Diego has Stone, Green Flash, Mission, Ballast Point and a few others that I can't think of. I recommend Mission. Their Shipwreck IIPA is one of my favorite beers ever. Plus, you can take the trolley to 12th   Imperial, walk there and then either walk or trolley to the game.  




 Yeah, if you take the trolley it's pretty much an all day endeavour. You'll see more just staying in SD.  




 Curious what your plans are in Tijuana. I loved going there during college.  




 Because each of those fouls count as team fouls. Once a team gets 5 team fouls in a quarter, they will shoot free throws on all subsequent fouls, meaning that strategy will almost certainly result in other, better shooters shooting free throws.  




 Look at those fundamentals!  




 I thought I was in r/funny and your friend was [the only white person]( http://imgur.com/1939Q6h). 




 On one hand, I agree with you. NFL players aren't my role models and I don't look to them for moral guidance. On the other hand, I love watching the NFL mishandle these situations at every turn.  




 They played 4 games at LSU's stadium, 3 at the Alamodome and one at Giants Stadium.  




 This would have been an absolute heartbreaker to lose considering the Dodgers' result today. Now we're only 2 games back and feeling pretty good. I would much rather be heading to PetCo than Wrigley.  




 From San Diego or just visiting?  




 You mean Panda Frien...ooh.  




 What happens if the Giants either win the division or finish second in the wild card? Do you get a refund?  




 Dodgers scored a run. Why does that bother me so much?  




 What a weird week for the Dodgers. Lose 9-0 to us, come back the next day and win 17-0, and now they're losing 15-0 to the Rockies.  




 M M's with obstacles.  




 Runer at third. Batter strikes out on a ball in the dirt. Batter heads towards first. Susac throws runner out at first. Runner on third runs home.  




 This reminds me of one of JD Dorian's fantasies.  




 What happens in r/timlincecum stays in r/timlincecum.  




 No, no, it's "revved up like a douche in the middle of the night."  




 Gutierrez sniffing his hat... 




 This is awesome. I just drove past Raley Field last night. I would love to go to some games to see some future Giants. 


Also, Tony Torcato. That's a name I haven't heard in a long time.  




 Are the refs just quicker to throw flags this year? It seems like every game I've watched so far has had a lot of penalties. It really takes the life out of the game.  




 A lot of these penalties are legit, but it sure seems like the refs are quicker to throw flags this year. It really sucks the life out of a game.  




 That feeling when your outfielder dives for a ball and misses and you have to watch the batter run for days... 




 You know when you're playing RTTS and the pitcher you just created is getting rocked in his first AA game? That's how I feel right now, but I can't rage quit.  




 I really doubt it would have been overturned. It was too close.  




 It's not so bad. You get to win a World Series every couple years ;-) 




 Ugh...come on.  




 I think twice. Mixed results.  




 Gutierrez sniffing his hat... 




 I would call Bum's performance Kershaw-esque, but Kershaw usually gives up 1.67 runs/game.   




 Who holds the overall Giants single season strikeout record?  




 You just took the rivalry too far!  




 Get some garlic fries. They will turn around even the crappiest of nights.  




 Can someone summarize the story Vin told about Blanco? I'm up north and watching a different broadcast.  




 Unclinch!  




 Keep this troll at 0.  




 Just put in Brian Wilson already. That's who we really want.  




 [MRW I just spent a couple minutes in the Dodgers game thread.]( http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/article/100/1000475/hero-showdown-cartman-vs-stewie-20090701022443845-000.jpg) 




 If you're in nor cal, it's 31. The guide says it's family feud, but it's actually the game.  




 [Oh, they mad.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dodgers/comments/2g8ulp/game_chat_912_dodgers_8363_giants_8165_715_pm_pt/ckgvi6a) 




 YOU GET A DOUBLE! YOU GET A DOUBLE! EVERYONE GETS A DOUBLE!  




 Why can't I find the game on TV?  




 That's what happened. Jeff didn't have room for it at his temporary place, so he had Tony hang on to it.  




 I don't know if my nerves could handle it though.  




 For a starter to get a win he needs to:

1. Pitch at least 5 innings.
2. Leave the game with the lead. Had Vogey finished the 7th, he would be in line for the win because the Giants scored in the bottom of the inning. 
3. His team cannot give up the lead for the rest of the game.  




 Kid's huffing paint out of that finger.  




 Nope. Machi will get the win if the score holds.  




 Unclinch your bums, guys and gals!  




 [Pagan looking like he stepped right out of a telenovela.](http://i.imgur.com/YxXI9Yh.jpg) 




 Should have pushed it fair, jerk.  




 Looks freezing there. For once, I'm glad I'm not in the crowd.  




 We'll probably have to choose between Vogey and Peavy, which is an easy choice.  




 The biggest surprise of the address for me was the way the president talked about the Assad regime. He said the regime will never regain the legitimacy that they have lost. I don't necessarily disagree with that, but I'm surprised to hear the president write the regime off as a potential ally against ISIS.

Assad is in control of an entire air force, and what seems to be a more organized military than the rebels. I would not have been shocked to see the US reluctantly side with Assad in exchange for his assistance in going after ISIS. The language the President used tonight rules that possibility out.  




 The biggest change from what we've already been doing is we are now expanding the air strikes to Syria. 




 I'm just going on memory, so take this with a grain of salt, but he stated his plan to:


1. Begin air strikes in Syria.

2. Arm the enemies of ISIS, including moderate Syrian rebel groups.

3. Send 400+ more troops to Iraq in non-combat roles.  




 I'm sorry, but this just isn't correct. Just because they commit horrendous crimes doesn't mean they aren't religious. They certainly don't represent the majority of Muslims, but it's not accurate to say that they aren't religious. I think we can be mature enough to criticize a terrorist group without attacking an entire religion.  









 It just went final in San Francisco.  




 Padres now up 6-2 with a runner on 2nd with 1 out.  




 Joe Panik. So hot right now. Joe Panik.  




 Padres have runners on the corners with no outs.  




 Petit pitching like he has somewhere to be after the game.  




 They can have the MVP, we'll take the division.  




 I read that they are only ~5 games over .500 in games when Kershaw doesn't pitch. That's the best argument for Kershaw winning the MVP I've heard yet.  




 A Dodger fan in r/baseball summed up my exact thoughts about LA in a thread last night. They're winning games, but there's something not quite right about them. I think they're vulnerable and I wouldn't be surprised if they struggle in the final 3 weeks. 




 Panik is a stud.  




 Loved watching him play at Notre Dame. It's a shame his game didn't carry over into the NBA.  




 Najera?  




 Stole this idea from r/baseball. 


I'll start. Keon Clark. I just looked him up and last year he was sentenced to 8 years in prison for weapons charges. He also claims to have never played a game sober in his NBA career.  




 Finally, that city has something to be proud of other than a two ingredient sandwich and a fictional boxer. 




 I remember when Noah Lowry and Jerome Williams looked like they were both going to be studs for us.  




 A three quarter triangle? What an idiot. 




 One more touchdown and the Cowboys will cover the spread. With these refs, I wouldn't be surprised.  




 Week one and I'm already reminded what annoyed me about the NFL last year: Ticky tack penalties and so many commercials.  




 Geno is looking LEGIT! Surprise of the day so far.  




 Especially impressive considering he was batting in the .280s a month ago. He's been on another level lately.  




 The steak ends at 46 after a 1 out double. 


Mark Buehrle's ML record was set in 2009. The previous NL record of 41, which Petit also broke today, was set by Jim Barr in 1972. 
 




 I'm watching Parks and Rec and seeing how out of shape Chris Pratt is in season 1. That makes his recent transformation all the more impressive. Do you have a favorite actor/actress body transformation?  




 I know, I know I hate posts here where OP makes excuses too.

I'm staying at my parents' house for a few months. My dad has a bench. So, I can do bench, DLs, rows. He also has dumbbells and a pullup bar, so I can do dumbbell press and pullups. Everything I need to build a strong upper body is there. The problem is, he doesn't have a way to safely squat. The only thing he has for lower body is a leg extension/leg curl machine attached to the bench. 

What kind of results can I expect to my lower body if I combine that with dumbbel lunges? Are there any other lower body exercises I can do with the equipment I have?  




 It seems like the general consensus around here is that deadlifts are the single best lift you can do. I'm wondering what your body would look like if you only did deadlifts. 



















 I thought it would be a good idea if, once a week, we had a weekly discussion thread where we could discuss anything.

My question to you: What sporting events do you have your eyes on over the MLB all-star break? 

I ended the first half of the season with a perfect day, betting on SF, CIN, TB, ATL and LAA. Nothing like having a perfect day and then not having baseball for the next few days.

What's on your mind this week? 









 I'm reading *The Master and Margarita* right now. I'm only about half way through, but I think Woland should be played by Johnny Depp in a role similar to Willy Wonka or Jack Sparrow; obviously intelligent, but a little spacey, although you're never quite sure if it's an act or not.  Ivan would be played by a younger actor. Maybe someone like Heath Ledger.  




 There was a thread recently about classics that have not aged well and I'm curious about the opposite. What classic books have aged well? 









 I just read it for the first time and while it was a decent story, it didn't strike me as exceptional in any way. Why is it so famous almost 100 years after it was written? 









 I just landed this morning and immediately did the Freedom Trail. I'll be here until Thursday night and I'm looking for suggestions from locals for activities to do. I definitely want to catch a game at Fenway either tonight or tomorrow. I also want to go to a brewery. I know Sam Adams is the famous one, but I've heard good things about Harpoon. What else do you recommend I do? 









 I have always wanted to do this and I'll probably never get a better chance to do it than next month. I had some travel plans with a friend that fell through, so I have a week off work. More importantly, I can fly for free or nearly free through a family member who works for an airline. If you've done it before, what was your experience like? What advice can you share? 




 Right now I weigh 165 lbs @ 5'10". I included lifts at 3 different weights: 135, 185, 200. Just want to make sure I'm not headed towards a preventable injury. Please take a look and let me know how I can improve.

 I'm constantly wondering how I'm going to get my next meal. I wake up in the morning and I try to remember how much food is in the house. How much milk do I have and is it enough to make it through the day? When will I find time to go to the store today to get more milk for tomorrow? Did I remember to wash my blender last night? Is today lifting day? I think about how many calories I need to have consumed by the time I leave for work, because I know I will be too tired to cook a big meal when I come home. I don't want to be hungry at work, but I also don't want protein farts. I lay in bed browsing reddit on my phone, but I know I should be eating.

If I start to feel hungry at work, I fret over the gains I'm losing. I count the minutes until I can take my break and find some food. But I only have 15 minutes. I run to Starbucks and hope they have breakfast sandwiches left. That will have to hold me over for the rest of my shift. 


I come home feeling tired, but I can't go to bed until I hit my caloric goal. I debate whether I have the energy to cook a full meal or if I should just piece away at some milk and snacks for a bit. I choose the latter. I hit my goal for the day, but at what cost? I now have almost nothing left for the following day. If today was a struggle, tomorrow will only be harder. I look at my shirtless body in the mirror as I brush my teeth. I'm tired and bloated, but goddammit if I don't look bigger. 









 Pretty dark, but could be funny if done right. 














 Brothers and sisters in swole, like many of you, I didn't think it could happen to me. I read your stories of swolestation and felt the same rage you felt, but I thought I was safe. Surely those around me appreciate me for my personality, I believed. Yet, yesterday, at my own place of employment no less, I was used like some piece of farm equipment.

I'm relatively new to the Iron Path, but Brodin has been very good to me. I've noticed the stealthy glances of passersby as they 'mire my aesthetics, but I can take that because I also consider myself swole of spirit. But what happened yesterday was more than I can bare.

My work has conducted a food drive over the last two months to collect food for the less fortunate. I was extra motivated, as I saw this as an opportunity to give the aspiring followers of Brodin the fuel they need to make mad gains. Our store was very successful in our efforts and yesterday, we finally delivered the boxes of food to the food closet on the other side of town. There were dozens of boxes, many filled with canned goods. 

Without warning or asking me if I wanted to help, my boss informed me yesterday that she "needed my muscles" to help her deliver the food. I was dumbfounded. I've always tried to be the best employee I could be, but suddenly I found myself as nothing more than a tool to help move nonperishable food items. I have never felt so objectified. 

I sat in silence next to my boss on the car ride over as I tried my best to contain my tears. When we finally arrived, I did my best to deliver the boxes as quickly as possible so I could return to work and have a good think in the break room. As soon as the last box was set down, the food closet manager said perkily, "We sure are lucky to have you. Otherwise we would have been moving boxes all afternoon." Do you believe the nerve? She didn't even consider the possibility that the previous day was deadlift day and maybe lifting heavy boxes off the ground wasn't ideal for me. 

I'm at a loss, reddit. I thought my place of employment was my sanctuary. What should I do? 




 I'm not the most devout worshipper of Brodin, but I have paid my dues at the Iron Temple regularly this year, and have been blessed with righteous gains. I've been swolested on a couple of occasions, but I forgive those people, for they know not the error of their ways. The pain that their actions caused me was erased after an experience yesterday at work.


An unruly customer, neither swole of body or mind, threatened my boss after she banned him from the store. This was the third time she has had to ask him to leave and each time he has made a scene while exiting. Unfortunately, I was not present to witness the events as they happened that day, but they worried my boss. As the day went on and she resumed normal work activity, she needed to go to her car to get something. Although I was the youngest man working that day, it was me she asked to walk with her for protection. Brodin gave me this opportunity to use my gains for good. I escorted her to and from her car without incident. Although my presence was unnecessary, it felt good to be asked to provide protection. 





























 I just noticed that Waino is starting for the Cardinals today. That's HUGE!  




 Also meaning Volquez would pitch a potential 163rd game against St. Louis if it's needed.  




 I parlayed ATL with PIT. 




 I've been a fan of the sport for a while, but I never had a club team that I felt attached to, which kept me from really getting into it. Republic FC Is my team now. Looking forward to many more great seasons ahead (hopefully in MLS).  




 Sad news everyone. Someone broke into the LA Dodgers trophy case last night. The thieves were last seen fleeing the stadium carrying a blue carpet.  




 A Dodgers fan doesn't understand what "World Series" means. Sounds about right.  









 Can we get a gif of Amy G getting sprayed in the face? I, uh, need it...for stuff.  




 You mean you almost ji22ed.  




 **St. Louis Cardinals ML** vs Arizona Diamondbacks 


St. Louis is clinging to a one game lead in the division going into the final series of the season, so they still have a lot to play for. Arizona has all but given up. Michael Wacha is pitching for the Cardinals and I think he'll have a good game.  




 We're on fire right now. Yesterday's potd, Metallurg Magnitogorsk -1.5, hit, which makes three correct picks in a row. Let's keep it going! 




RULES 

 No picks that are favorite by more than -200 


 No parlay or teaser bets, single bets only, prop bets are fine 


 Please include what sport you are talking about in your pick 


 Pick with most points at the end of voting is our pick of the day  




 I've been a Giants fan for 15 years, but Derek Jeter has been a constant in baseball for as long as I can remember. This is kind of like saying goodbye to a part of my childhood.  




 Trying to stay optimistic here:


1. We're still in great position to win the wild card.


2. The goal of the game is to win the World Series, not the division. We're still up 2-0 on the Dodgers there.  




 Kershaw looks like Sunshine from Remember the Titans.  




 Andrew Susac is the go ahead run...the next time through the order.  




 His arm has been thrown out for 2 years.  




 The joke is on you. You can't clinch if the game never ends.  




 Bochy might as well ask if any Giants fans in the crowd can throw strikes.  




 I'm assuming if you have $749 to spend on Candlestick seats, you also have a man cave to put them.  




 I should win a Cy Young... 




 What is Uribe's walk up song? It's catchy. 




 I once bought a growler of IPA from Stone. The woman working there said I should drink it within 48 hours of opening it. I decided to drink all 74 ounces in one night. Big mistake.  




 You have to finish your 6 pack by tomorrow. You can't have a San Diego beer in the fridge during a Padres series.  




 This really has been a great season for the rivalry. There's a perfect combination of fear, respect and hatred for each team.  




 [How Arias feels in the dugout right now]( http://i.imgur.com/3leLBzY.gif) 




 Slightly above the mean^for ^^a ^^^white ^^^^guy 




 I'm guessing we want the lefty-righty matchup with Kershaw against Arias.  




 I'm betting on a lot of baseball games on Thursday, it's hard to pick just one potd. I'll go with the **Giants/Padres under 6.5**. The Giants have not been hitting the ball well lately and the Padres haven't hit the ball well all year. On top of that, Andrew Cashner is pitching for San Diego. He shut down SF last week. Yusmeiro Petit has been one of the most consistent pitchers for the Giants over the last month and a half. 


My other picks for the day are **DET ML**, **MIL ML**, **WAS ML** and, **TB/BOS over 8.5**. 




 We have a two day win streak going as yesterday's potd, the Angels ML, hit. Let's go for three!  




 It got scary in the late innings, but the Angels hang on. Good call on this one.  




 That's what happens when you meet girls at Wagner-fest.  




 If he goes 3, then Lincecum will come in, which probably means another run or two.  




 In the last week, the only two Giants hitters who have shown any consistency are Gregor Blanco and Joe Panik. Posey, Sandoval, Pence, Belt, Crawford and Perez look lost. 


Edit: I considered the over 6. Hudson's last start against LA he didn't retire a batter in the second inning. He looked bad against the Padres last time out too. The problem I have with the over 6 is that he's going to be on a short leash. He won't be in the game long enough to allow 6 runs. On top of that, Kershaw is pitching for LA.



Edit: Decided to parlay Dodgers ML and over 6.   




 I like the value of the **Chicago White Sox** ML. Chris Sale is pitching against Verlander. I think the Sox at +108 has good potential.  




 Hudson's been getting rocked for a month now. This is a safe bet, but my book has LA at -250 right now, so the pay out isn't enough for me, a Giants fan, to bet against my own team.  




 For the Giants, that's been the case for close to two weeks. Even when Bum hit his homerun, the dugout wasn't nearly as excited as they should have been.  




 This is a frustrating team to watch right now. There's no energy.  




 Yes, but we can't afford to have him hit like this while he figures it out. These games are too important.  




 Right now we have offensive black holes at 1st base and left field. We'll have to figure that out by next week.  




 0-2 count in a one run ballgame against your biggest rival? Time for the wave! 




 I've honestly seen nothing but respect for Vin in r/sfgiants.   




 I honestly believe that Curt Schilling only has a job with ESPN because they feel bad that he went broke and then got cancer.  




 [We know how good he is ;-)](http://mlb.mlb.com/images/10252010/15826076/250x350_Uribe.jpg) 




 Maybe the most satisfying home run of the year.  




 Little do you know, there are world series trophies in that garbage can.  




 I thought I saw him pull up limp as he hit first too.  




 Puig got hit in the first. Words were exchanged, benches were warned.  




 Hopping on the bandwagon to lose in the first round once every 3 years?  




 Does anyone know for sure if the benches were warned after that HBP?  




 Puig knows he couldn't take Bum. It would be like a kid getting beat up by his dad.  




 Am I crazy or does Carl Crawford get an usual number of rest days? Is there a reason for that? He's on fire this month, but it seems like he's out of the lineup for half of the Dodgers game I've watched recently.  




 The reason I keep coming to this subreddit is because there's always a pick of the day that is two teams I've never heard of, in a sport I don't watch, in a league I've never heard of. I love putting a bet on Japanese level II women's soccer and waking up to some money. Warms my heart.  




 We got back on track on Tuesday with the Kansas City Royals ML. They won 7-1 Let's extend the streak to two.  




 My 5 team parlay was in tact going into the CAR/PIT game last Sunday. I thought the Panthers were a sure thing, but they totally blew it for me.  




 I'm on board with this as well. Good pick.  




 Me too. And that thought made me sick. I think what's so great about the rivalry right now is that there's a mutual fear of each other's team.  




 Off the top of my head, I can't remember a more exciting game. LA has so many guys with power, I was certain one of them would hit a walk off homer. That was pure torture for 4+ hours, but I loved every second of it.  




 He couldn't have picked the ball up and placed it in Butera's glove any better. Incredible!  




 It's a good thing they won, because I don't think I could have handled a loss. See you all tomorrow night, boys and girls.  




 Auburn checking in. He went to Jesuit.  




 Susac was held at third, but Blanco didn't notice and went for the triple. When he finally saw that third wasn't open he was in a pickle. When the Dodgers tried to get him, Susac ran home.  




 Crawford channeling his inner Chris Dominguez with that throw.  




 Puig could not have walked the ball to home plate and placed it in Butera's glove in a better position than that throw. Amazing.  




 Is there any doubt that this is the best rivalry in baseball right now? Yankees/Red Sox hasn't been exciting for a few years.  




 This is the rivalry at its best. I love it, ^but ^^I ^^^also ^^^^hate ^^^^^it 




 The Giants have 9 hits and the Dodgers have 3 errors. This game is being handed to us. We just need to take it.  




 You didn't think anyone would know who the greatest of all time is?  




 #RedMamba  




 This is the Giants/Dodgers rivalry at its best. I love it^but ^^I ^^^also ^^^^hate ^^^^^it 




 If he had held Belt there, we would have been freaking out on him too. Literally the only way Belt is out at home is if Puig's throw is perfect, and it was.  




 I don't see a better option at 3rd unfortunately.  




 Too much butter, not enough finger.  




 I like the hustle. 




 Look at those empty seats behind home plate. Disgraceful!  




 Free baseball!!! 




 Instructions for Dodgers fans.  




 Good morning ^good ^afternoon ^^good ^^night 




 We liked him when his schtick was new and exciting, but I think most of us were tired of defending him by the time he left.  




 The only thing bigger than Brian Wilson's ego is his era.  




 This pitcher looks like he's about to join ISIS. 




 Last week of the season, Bottom 7, one on against your most hated rival. Better do the wave!  




 There's a free version, but you only get a limited number of skips per hour and you can't select which song you listen to, only the artist/album.


I pay $10/month to be able to listen any song at any time. You can get a free trial to see if it's worth it. I even got a 3 month's for the price of one deal when I signed up.  




 Good morning^goodafternoon^^good night


Edit: Fuck it! I don't know how to format.  




 Your mom took her shirt off?!! 




 Your rock hard Peavy is giving me a Peavy.  




 What should we do? Cry about it?  




 That's frustrating as fuck when that happens in Road to the Show. It's got to be even worse in real life.  




 I think any intentional HBPs are dumb. It's hard to say definitively that that was intentional though.  




 Matt Kemp was distracted wondering how Rihanna dumped him for Chris Brown.  




 Kemp called it. That one's on Puig.  




 I'm assuming there's bad traffic getting to the game.  




 Jake Peavy looks like he could have been an Irish bare knuckle boxer a hundred years ago.  




 I like the value of the **KC Royals** ML. They're the underdog and they're playing a team with a nearly identical record, but they have a better pitcher pitching. I think they're worth a bet. 



I also like the **under 6** on the **Dodgers/Giants** game. Bumgarner has absolute ownage against the Dodgers in his career. Greinke is pitching for LA and the Giants haven't been hitting lately. It might also be worth putting a unit on the Giants ML. They're underdogs, but I think there's good value there.  




 What happened to the user who usually posts the potd thread?  




 I think this is the safest MLB bet of the day. St. Louis is a better team and they have their best pitcher pitching. 




 I got tired of my usual workout music. I had always been a fan of certain songs on The Dark Knight Rises score because they made made feel like Batman training in a prison cell, so I set out to find equally motivating music. I took mainly from the work of Hans Zimmer (TDKR, TDK, Pirates of the Caribbean, Gladiator, Man of Steel, Inception, The Lone Ranger), but there are a few other artists in the playlist. It's mostly upbeat, but has the occasional slower pace, which makes the eventual build up even more epic and motivational. 



Give it a listen and let me know what you think. Tell me if there's a song I should add to or remove from the list. I'm by no means knowledgeable about this kind of music, so I'm sure there are plenty of awesome songs that I don't know about. 



[Here is the finished product]( http://open.spotify.com/user/swolebuddha/playlist/1gQZicqZROQnFYsbQO0Zp7). I hope it serves you well. 




 It's kind of late and no one has posted a potd thread yet, so I'll do it.  




 As you can see, my picks thus far are 12-1-1 against the spread


Wow, this guy *is* pretty good.



 That puts me at a total of 17-12-1 so far this year




Oh... 




 Is this the only nationally televised morning game? Usually Fox will have one, but they don't.  




 I made a parlay bet that the Angels would win and more than 7 1/2 runs would be scored. Help a Giants fan out, will you halos? 


Edit: Atta team.  




 I broke my own rule of not betting on games I'm emotionally invested in. I took the under 6 on this game. I have that much faith in Petit. ^And ^that ^little ^faith ^in ^our ^offense 




 I can't find an email about it and I can't redeem it on the app. Has anyone besides OP been successful? Maybe it has to be done on a pc. 


Edit: Can't find it on my computer either. Maybe it expired?  




 I'm down to go out in Roseville most nights. We should meet up.  




 Posey has 15 RBIs in his last 15 games. That's second best in the league for the month of September.  




 If Timmy pitches well tonight, I say we start him for Hudson next week in LA.  




 His smile is so smug. You can tell he's proud of his idea.  




 [Broken bat Kuiper]( http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2013/0904/mlb_kuiper_kh_200.jpg) 




 Pretty smokey in the mornings in Auburn too.  
























 Because there is no force. If the bases were loaded, touching the plate would be enough. 




 Pablo rakes right handed pitching too. 




 35 




 Just bought Moneyball (book) today. Stoked to start it after the game tonight.  




 Pete Rose looks like a Cabbage Patch Doll. 




 Pablo Sandoval, you're the next contestant on "Who wants to win a $90 million contract." 




 My baseball pet peeve is when crowds boo timeouts, pick off attempts and mound visits.  




 Nothing but love for Nate. Good Giant.  




 And they say baseball is a sport for nerds... 




 Dude, that's exactly it. It's the chin and slicked back hair. 




 Welcome to AT T. Where homeruns go to die. 




 I don't care what anyone thinks, I fucking love that Jeter commercial. 




 Good, good, let the hate flow through you. 




 That's the greatest compliment you can give a baseball team. 




 [Until April, Dodgers fans.]( http://i.imgur.com/TaTdV.gif?news) 




 [Until April, Dodgers fans.]( http://i.imgur.com/TaTdV.gif?news) 




 The $200 million contract probably makes it pretty easy. 




 It was a no win situation for Mattingly. Pulling the best pitcher alive for one of the worst bullpens in the league would have been criticized too.  




 You should come to the good side. You get one every 2 years. 




 How the hell, in a NLDS game, do they not have a camera angle from behind the base?  




 This was a must win game for the Cardinals with Kershaw and Greinke pitching games 4 and 5. Should be an exciting end to the series. 




 #I'm up all night to get Lackey!  




 AJ Ellis stole Puig's hitting ability Space Jam style.  




 I hate it when people compare Matt Carpenter to Jesus. I mean, he's cool and all, but he's no Matt Carpenter.  




 Puig is historically bad right now...I love it. 




 Someone has this exact same comment in the earlier game day thread, Even down to the same misspelling of Nielsen.  




 That's the conclusion the author of the article came to.  









 Hunter Pence hates off days so much he had the team take a dive today so the series could continue.  




 From the looks of it, they're still in their seats.  




 In the playoffs, Bumgarner turns into Kershaw and Kershaw turns into Edwin Jackson.  




 We're used to stretches of no offense. 




 Like Sherman could even be in the same conversation as Griffey Jr.  




 Ishikawa is a completely different player now than he was with us in 2010. He used to be an automatic out that played outstanding defense at first. Now he always gives a professional at bat.  




 Pablo wants that $90mil.  




 Bum took a ball off the shin? That poor baseball! 




 It's gotta be his defense. 




 What exactly does this mean for the franchise? Why should I be excited?  




 If only I could maintain an erection! 




 TBS just plays the same five commercials on repeat. 




 As opposed to Detroit, where no one has a job.  




 I loved going to trivia night at Rosie O'Grady's when I lived in San Diego.  




 I'm curious, are any non-Angels fans rooting for the Angels in this series? It seems like the Royals are everyone's sweetheart right now.  




 At this point, the only thing Josh Hamilton can hit is a crack pipe.  




 Game going 19 innings confirmed.  




 Same here. I don't have anything against the A's themselves. Their fans on the other hand... 




 If half of the salty Tiger fans in this thread had bought tickets, they probably could have come close to selling out CoMerica today. 




 Red Sox/Yankees is definitely over hyped, but when they're both competitive it's a great rivalry. It was the best in baseball in the mid 2000s and will be again someday. It's felt forced the last few years though.  




 The AL West is odd because there are no great rivalries.  A's/Angels was pretty good this year though. It probably won't last though. 




 Vertical line 




 The last resort of a fan who has given up hope. 




 I agree about the A's/Giants. Most Giants fans generally root for the A's to succeed. It seems like Oakland fans are the only ones who consider this a rivalry.  




 Remains silent 




 Is this game seriously not a sellout? That's shameful!  




 Torii has a son named Money Hunter? Dear God... 




 KC was wild for the WC game and Pittsburg was wild until Crawford hit the grand slam. Every other crowd has been a let down. Looking forward to the Royals game tonight.  




 Nah, gotta rep your city.  




 It's easy to say Zimmerman was pulled to early now that we have the benefit of hindsight, but he had just walked the potential tying run to bring Posey to the plate. It would have been Posey's fourth AB against him and he had had a few good at bats already, including a rocket to third base last time. 




 This game is going 19 innings.  




 We got dominated for 8.2 innings, but still stole this one. Feelsgoodman.jpeg  




 Whooo? 




 Hudson pitched 7.1 innings of one run ball and he's not even the best pitcher for the Giants tonight. 




 *"John, this game is not over yet."* 




 I'm telling my my grandchildren about the first 9 innings right now. 




 I don't think there's a single person outside of the LA area that doesn't have the Royals as their #2 team right now.  




 Did I glance? Please. I'm still erect from that!  




 I've never seen as much salt from a subreddit as I see in /r/angelsbaseball right now.  




 Hala wala!  




 Which scrub did the Dodgers start tonight and when do they pitch their ace?  




 That kid behind home plate will swing at anything. Madbum needs to start with the chin music and work his way across the plate. 




 Really Kruk? It wouldn't surprise you if the best hitter in the NL got a hit?  




 Somewhere in the middle of game six in the 2002 WS, I commented about how sad the fans looked. That game and series turned around right there. I'm not doing that again. 




 Madison "Dad dick" Bumgarner  




 Seriously, who has sex without being wasted?  




 Who the hell cares what Curt Schilling thinks?  




 This silence is deafening.  




 [Aye! Que lindo!]( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BjRPvHECYAAZcQ5.jpg) 




 Very good. 




 Hunter Pence prefers Hunts ketchup. 




 Likewise, Piratesbros.  




 He's been a solid bench player for us. Always has a professional at bat, has power and plays great defense ^at ^^first ^^base 




 [Let's do this!]( http://imgur.com/ZJGHNh3) 




 I'd love to face Kershaw twice in 7 games^no ^^I ^^^wouldn't 




 I've always been a fan of logos that include the letters of the team's city. It seems like the NL has more of that. 




 Can we have a moment of appreciation for MLB Network? After being raised on ESPN, it's such a refreshing change. 




 If it should come to it, rather than extra innings, the game should be decided by a competition between left fielders. Whoever is better at shagging grounders at 1st wins. 




 Best of luck, Piratesbros! I've never been a believer in having number 2 teams, but if I had to pick one, it would be you.  




 Let's just end the season after this game. No one can top this. 




 Time to send back the "Always October" sweatshirts.  




 Alright, I think we've all established that we don't like the announcers. We can talk about something else.  




 Ernie seemed so bored during that home run call I assumed it was a lazy fly ball to center. That made it all the more shocking.  




 #BOOM. YOASTED.  




 Best bullpen in the league.  




 Son, there are some things you should know about Missouri... 




 Something tells me we're not watching the future WS champions tonight.  




 It's fitting that a Marlins fan is confused by an excited crowd.  




 You jelly, bro? 




 Not until the bottom of the ninth in game 7 of the WS.  




 Unless there's two of them, Bridges is right by SDSU. They are offering $3 beers for anyone in Giants gear.  




 I feel like I should be excited, but I don't know what this means. Can anyone enlighten me?  




 2006 @ Miami 21-0 




 It's like watching the end of an era.

 That's a routine 9-4-2-3.  




 It's in the box score as a double, because he was thrown out going back to second. I just don't know how to show that he was retired.  




 How do I score that Belt double at home?  




 Says a lot about Jeter that he can get a standing ovation from the fans he absolutely tormented for 20 years. Baseball won't be the same without him.  
























 *"Bum's being a real Jew out there."* 




 NO 




 Even year magic!  




 *Shutters*


Edit: *shudders* 




 How do you Yost, that which is Yost.  




 You shut your mouth!  




 Did you guys see the late break on that snot rocket from Bum?  




 This exact comment was posted in an earlier game thread. NEVER FORGET!  




 Hot girl in left field bleachers.  




 Hosmer might be my favorite non-Giant.  




 Still a lot of baseball to be played. 




 We might get to see the best bullpen in the league sooner rather than later.  




 This pitcher needs a nickname that suggests he plays well in important games.  




 There's something you should know about reddit... 




 *"Hunter Pence looks like one of the burglars from Home Alone."*


More commentary from my sister.  




 *"None of the other team's players are cute."*


My sister's analysis of the game so far.  




 I started lifting in my garage where I have a bench and a barbell, so I can do the major barbell lifts with the exception of squats. Am I doomed to be a deformed freak who looks like he skips leg day?  




 CONGRATS ON THE DIVISION TITLE, DODGERS! 




 And now he has cemented his place in baseball history. Cool that it happened to him instead of a superstar  




 This is the funniest thing I've read on Reddit in months. How did your first time with the seat down go? 




 Dynasty! 




 If I would have put a piece of coal between my cheeks at the beginning of this game, I would have a diamond right now.  




 As much as I say I hate games like this, it really is what I love about sports.  




 Walk off balk. 




 Not in the third inning. 




 DAE Wainwright??? 




 Painfully awkward Rob Lowe hits a little too close to home.  




 Posey. Bum if he deals tonight. 




 I finally got around to alt-j's new album, This is All Yours. I was a fan of their first album, but I'm really disappointed with their latest work. It's very boring to me. I found myself constantly checking to see how many songs I had left and I could listen to something else. Anyone else feel this way?


On a related note, if you're a fan of alt-j, give Battleme a listen.  




 Harold just said, "Oedipus pitch." 




 What kind of adult would want a pirate themed living room?  




 Just don't watch highlights from Monday night ^too ^soon? 




 If Buster Posey and Hunter Pence had a child together, it would be Matt Duffy. 




 He said, "...100, and 99, respectively." 




 His real name makes him sound like a bare knuckle boxer. 




 Why do we need to see Tim Hudson while he's being interviewed? I want to see the game!  




 *"Look at me. Look at me. I'm the captain now."* 




 *sigh*

A's fans tying to manufacture a rivalry. 




 I knew exactly what this gif was going to be, but I still opened it. 




 OP pls, what does the meme say?  




 This is an album that I normally would never listen today, but I work in a store that sells CDs and quite a few people have been buying this lately. This morning, we played it at the store and I like what I heard, so I listened to it more closely when I got home from work. I have to say, it blew me away. 


While it definitely sounds more like a Tony Bennett album than a Lady Gaga album, Gaga knocks it out of the park. Her voice is a natural fit for this genre of music. In fact, she blows Tony Bennett out of the water. 


When I played this album, I couldn't help but imagine myself in a 1950s club, sitting at a table with a cigar and a glass of scotch...wearing a silk robe, while Bennett, Gaga and their band do their thing on stage. Even if this isn't your usual genre, it wasn't mine, give the album a spin because it truly is outstanding.  




 Scoring on a bad throw? How basic. 




 We won more games against STL than the Dodgers did!  




 Wild throw to first, you bum. 




 Our turn to walk off!  




 So 4th and goal from inside the 2. We opt to go for the TD and put the game away rather than make it a 13 point game and force their rookie QB to lead two touchdown drives.


4th and 1 near the STL 40 yard line. We opt to go for it rather than punt and pin the Rams inside their own 15. Instead, the Rams, who need a TD and a field goal to tie the game, only need to drive about 25 yards to get into field goal range. 




 Why go for it on 4th down when the Rams can still settle for a field goal. Now they're working on a short field.  




 Vernon is having a horrible game. 




 Just finished *Moneyball*. I'm looking for another nonfiction book, but something easily digestible.  




 I know there are a lot of Giants fans like me who live in the Sacramento area. Even if you don't, you should show your support for the Giants' AAA affiliate and join /r/SacramentoRivercats. The mod team there and at /r/AAAMiLB have worked hard to make sure each AAA team has a subreddit. Unfortunately, I think most of the current subscribers are still A's fans. Let's show them how loyal Giants fans are! 




 If only there was a system in place that would allow the two teams to play each other several times, then we could know which team is better.   




 We should pinch hit Bumgarner. 




 Almost every game in the playoffs has been close, but we haven't had a close series yet. Odd... 




 Saved by a wild pitch AGAIN! 




 http://i.imgur.com/FbuwEh4.gif 




 When you only face 4 batters, one home run is huge. 




 Had back surgery a few weeks ago. 




 If the Rockies are cheating, they sure are bad at it. 




 Matheny might have to put on the pads and catch the rest of this game.  




 Lance Lynn was 1 pitch away from striking out the side in order. Now he leaves the game and can do no better than a no decision. Rough. 




 He probably thought it was foul. It was hard to tell.  




 I gained a lot of respect for the Cards fans last night when they cheered when Jay was hit by a pitch when every other crowd would have booed like trained monkeys. 




 John Jay thinking he's Lorenzo Cain. 




 After what Matt Carpenter did to the Dodgers, I can't be mad at the guy.  




 Pitching one more inning will do that. 




 I've been waiting since 8 o'clock this morning for game time so I can pop open a beer without being judged by my mom.  




 I took Broncos -10.5 and was saved by the pick 6 as well. I got a second miracle with the Packers ML. 




 I like the Chargers -7.5. San Diego has been rolling this year and Oakland may be the worst team in the league.  




 Even Bumgarner's snot rockets have late break on them.  




 Crawford has the third best BA against lefties among left handed batters this year iirc.  




 Ball dude was on that like white on rice. 




 This comment is NaCl positive. 




 Giants and Cardinals are being way too civilized in this thread. It doesn't feel right.  




 Chrissy Redford is a babe. 




 Giants baseball. If it's not weird, we don't do it. 




 Was that an appeal to the 1st base umpire on a left handed hitter?  




 *"Cliche cliche cliche cliche?"*



*"Well, cliche cliche cliche cliche."* 




 When will the Giants/Dodgers playoff series that LA fans kept taking about start?  




 Cardinals uniforms look like they were taken off a field 100 years ago. Love them!  




 Well, if we're talking about the best hitting pitcher in baseball this year, can anyone top .258 with 4 homeruns?  




 He also hit .258 




 I like Harold Reynolds on Baseball Tonight, but he's insufferable as a color commentator.  




 Because Harold Reynolds.  




 One inning in and I finally realize how much I like having the regular play by play call. It's weird watching without it. 




 But then we would only have Joe Buck to complain about. 




 It's basically like Snapchat. You take a picture and all of your matches can see and "like" it for 24 hours. It's really pretty stupid, but if I can think of something funny to do, I'll do it. Android has moments too.  




 I've never had much luck with parlay bets, especially in football where upsets are fairly common, but they sure are exciting! I usually only do parlays when there are two events that are near sure things. You can usually find them in the early rounds of tennis tournaments when two top seeds are playing unknowns or in Champions League soccer when a great team is playing a team from a much smaller league. For football, I usually stick to single bets. If there are two games that I feel especially confident in, I will parlay the money lines.  




 Don't let that scare you away. 


I'm assuming you know what a parlay bet is, but if you don't, it's a single bet on multiple events. In this case, if the Packers win by 3.5 or more points and the Patriots win by more than three, you win. If either outcome does not occur, you lose. It seems like a reasonable bet to me. 


The -105 is referring to the odds that the Packers will win by 3.5 points or more. It's just a way for you to be able to quickly calculate about how much your return on the bet would be. The minus sign means the outcome is favored to happen. The higher the number is above 100, the more heavily favored it is. When dealing with points spreads, the odds are usually right around 100, meaning your profit will be slightly less than your original bet. If the odds say "Even", you will win exactly what you bet. If there is a plus sign in font of the odds, the event is not expected to happen. If something has odds of +115, it means you would win $115 on a $100 bet. 
 




 That's just tthe odds. In order to win $100, you would need to bet $105. Not sure why the Pats don't show the odds though.  




 Only a few likes so far. Will update if anything changes.  




 His Snapchat name is dickbaby69. He doesn't post much, but I usually get a chuckle when he does.  




 I took it from a guy I follow on Snapchat who does the YouTube channel BroScienceLife. He did It about a month ago.  




 Brian Cushing looks like the guy who would have sex with your girlfriend and then get mad at you when you get upset about it. 




 Good thing Carey isn't a ref. 




 Awesome, man! Looking forward to catching some games this season. 




 I'm assuming most of the mods are A's fans and the change in affiliation probably affected their interest in the River Cats. Are there any plans to change moderators and/or add moderators? I'd hate to see this subreddit be neglected. 




 As far as I'm concerned, Vogey cemented himself as a Giants legend last night. Couldn't be happier for the guy either. 




 Probably the MVP of the series, even in a losing effort. Not a fan of the guy's...baseball persona, but he really is a special player.  




 This is the first player to retire that I can remember coming up as a young guy. Weird. 


At any rate, he had quite the career.  




 Honestly, no one likes those self gratifying posts anyway. As if a Cardinals fan saying, "Great series. You have a good team. I would have rooted for you if you had beaten us" would make them feel any better. 




 Dude, don't be *that guy*. 




 This comment tests positive for NaCl.  




 Giants  Dodgers 




 Come on, man. Don't be like that. 




 Super creepy Rob Lowe  Far less attractive Rob Lowe 




 I think I saw him shit in a gutter in the Tenderloin before game three. 




 Romo has been nasty the last month. 




 That play might lead to a Posey Addendum to the Posey Rule.  
























 Alternative title: How to Piss Off r/baseball in 5 Steps 




 In a playoff game too! Is this the same Clayton Kershaw?  




 I'll always remember him as the promising young second baseman for the Yankees. I'm 22 now and some of the players who broke into the league when I started following baseball are starting to retire. It's an odd feeling. Kind of like I'm losing a part of my childhood.  




 I just bought a slow cooker and have been using it a lot. I'll share my most successful recipes. Here's the buffalo chicken I made tonight.


Chicken breasts (I used a little more than a pound and a half)

One bottle of buffalo wing sauce

One pack of dry ranch dressing mix


Put the chicken in the slow cooker, pour the bottle of buffalo wing sauce on the chicken and then sprinkle the ranch mix on top. Cook on high for 4-5 hours, then shred with a fork.


Next time I make this, I'll probably use less buffalo wing sauce, maybe 3/4 of a bottle.  




 I've never used a pressure cooker, so I don't know. 




 I used a pound and a half, but more would have worked fine with the same amount of beer. 




 I put chicken breasts, a can of beer and some spices in my crock pot on low for 7-8 hours. That way I can shred it and save some for future meals. I made burritos with chicken, beans and cheese. Just wrap them in foil and put them in the fridge or freeze them. 



Give /r/gainitmeals or even /r/gainit a look. They're going to be high calorie meals because they're designed for people trying to gain weight, but people in those subreddits love meals that can be cooked in bulk and eaten later. 




 Get a slow cooker. You can get them at thrift stores for cheap. If you get a big one, you can prepare a week's worth of meat at once. 




 I'm trying to prepare meals in advance and I also just bought a slow cooker. Yesterday I made chicken breasts and put them in burritos. It was delicious, so I wanted to share the recipe.


Place chicken breasts in slow cooker.

Add one 12 oz bottle of beer. I used Stella, but anything should work.

1/2 tsp of paprika

1/2 tsp of basil

1/2 tsp of garlic powder

1/2 tsp of salt

1/2 tsp if black pepper


Cook it on low for 7-8 hours and then use a fork to shred it. From there, you can do all kinds of stuff with it. I just made burritos with beans and cheese.


If you're like me, simplicity is the most important thing in a recipe. If something takes more than a handful of ingredients, I'm not going to make it. You could easily do this with just beer and chicken.  




 Are those the originals or reprints?  




 CONGRATULATIONS TO THE NL WEST CHAMPION LOS ANGELES DODGERS! 




 2014 is the sweetest. I've never felt as sick after a game as I did last night. That low made this high all the sweeter.  




 Dynasty! 




 Never seen him look even slightly interested in anything. 




 He's good and all, but he's no Bumgarner. 




 Someone turned the pitching sliders all the way up sometime in the 4th inning. 




 If my first kid is a boy, I'm naming him Madison. If it's a girl, I'll also name her Madison.  




 A good ol' fashioned pitchers duel with neither starter finishing the 4th inning. 




 George Brett finally getting around to reading Game of Thrones.  




 Ya know, I'll be fine with KC scoring one run for the rest of the season. 




 To be fair, the Giants' DP *was* spectacular. 




 In that commercial, there are 5 guys and one 6 pack of beer. No way that dude couldn't have driven home. 




 This has been the only competitive series this postseason. 




 Post history. You're one of the few r/Dodgers subscribers that I recognize by username.  




 I never thought I'd see the day when you, of all people, would be the voice of reason. 




 Clerks?  




 Time for Hudson to pitch the game of his life and ride off into the sunset with one of the greatest farewells ever.  




 I've never been this nervous for a game before.  




 Dude, that'd be gay. 




 When I read it, I imagined who I would cast in a movie version. Woland would be played by Johnny Depp in a combination of Jack Sparrow and Willy Wonka. Ivan would be a young Matt Damon.  




 It's only the 5th inning and I've already gone through the stages of grief.  




 At this point, I'm just hoping the Royals shoot their wad tonight and have nothing left for tomorrow.  




 Where was she during the last 29 years! 




 7 days old? She wasn't even alive when this series started. What a bandwagoner!  




 I'm back in nor cal now, but I went to school in San Diego and went to a lot of Padres games. Usually when they played SF, but not always.  




 Seriously! He just hops on the hot player and goes to town. It's like rubbing salt in my wounds. 




 Ryan needs to help move that fridge. 




 Panik is the first evolution of Tyler Colvin.  




 It all started with a one out walk... 




 I'm curious about previous winners of this. Is it a good indicator of a team's future success?  




 EBay for things that can be easily shipped. Craigslist for large items. 




 I'm super happy for Juan Perez. Erin Andrews was reporting that he was crying in the dugout after hearing the news about Oscar Taveras. Huge moment for him. 




 That's what happens when I eat Taco Bell. 




 DAE Bumgarner??? 




 I should become a professional baseball player... 




 THAT'S THROWING LIKE A GIRL! 




 Kershaw better be taking notes at home. 




 Perez and Taveras are both Dominican. They were probably team mates at one point. 




 I just read Moneyball and he mentions players watching film of earlier at bats midgame. It wouldn't surprise me if there's someone in the tunnel who told them or if someone checked their cellphone.    




 How much contact with the outside world do players have during the game? Would they know about Taveras yet?  




 They've had interviews every game this postseason.  




 Seriously, why can't he just smoke pot like a normal kid? 




 I'm sure they do by now. 




 Confirmed by whom? 




 In an earlier thread someone said Steve Perry probably has no friends and only comes to games to get high fives from strangers. I still laugh when I think of that. 




 THAT'S THROWING LIKE A GIRL! 




 I never thought I would say it, but I'd go with Strickland here. That means he probably won't pitch tomorrow. 




 I was feeling so down a few innings ago. Now I'm feeling on top of the world. Baseball will do that. 




 ...he's not 




 They either get super cocky or annoyingly fake humble.  




 DAE BIG 4??? 




 Why stop at 2010??? 




 0 rings since '89 is why we mock you. 




 I've had that feeling for 2 1/2 games. 




 Is anyone else annoyed by how Mo'ne Davis gets so much louder when she says, "That's throwing like a girl!" 




 Cain saved 90 feet there. 




 It's raining so hard my satellite signal is out. 




 ...and a(t least one) World Series ring. 




 It's a difficult game to win if you can't pitch or hit.  




 That's probably the last time we'll see Vogey pitch, at least in a Giants uniform. He had some great moments here. 




 That's what speed do! 




 Blanco has really stepped up in Pagan's absence, especially in this series. He's been getting on base and playing great defense.  




 The suspect is Marcelo Marquez, b. July 20, 1980. 




 The search seems to be narrowed to the neighborhood between Placer High School and the American River Canyon. Residents are not allowed to return to their homes. SWAT teams are searching homes.


This is right by my house and I went to high school at Placer, so I know the area well. The neighborhood behind the school has narrow streets with a lot of trees. It would be very hard to spot a suspect from a helicopter. Past the homes is the American River Canyon. This is really rocky terrain that would be difficult to maneuver quickly. However, large portions of the area do not have trees due to the once planned construction of a dam. If he wanders into this area, it would be game over. Crossing the river would be nearly impossible without being spotted by one of the helicopters.  




 Same here. Police blocked of an intersection right by my house. 




 Well, what happened?  




 Definitely northern California. 




 One officer, Danny Oliver, is confirmed dead. 


The search seems to be narrowed to the neighborhood between Placer High School and the American River Canyon. Residents are not being allowed to enter the area. 




 The search is focusing on Auburn, CA between I-80 and the American River Canyon. Road blocks are set up all over town. All Auburn schools are on lockdown.

Update: Carjacked vehicle reportedly recovered on Riverview Drive in Auburn. Residents reporting gunfire. This is several miles away from the high school, but very close to an elementary school. 2 suspects believed to be on foot. 


Update: One female suspect in custody. Second male suspect still at large.  




 I live in Auburn very close to where the police are searching. I'm on high alert right now.

 Police are blocking off an intersection less than a mile away from my house in Auburn. I'm looking out the window half expecting to see the suspects.

Update: One female suspect in custody. Second male suspect still at large. 


Update: Placer High School is being evacuated. 


Update: It sounds like the search is being narrowed to the neighborhood between Placer High School and the American River Canyon. Residents being prevented from returning to their homes.


Update: One officer, Danny Oliver, confirmed dead. His partner was shot it the head. Status unknown.

 Brothers, I come to you in a fit of rage. I had heard the fables, but until this morning I had never personally encountered a gains thief. 



I was doing warm up sets of deadlifts, hopefully working up to a new PR. When I sat down to rest between sets, some jerk comes up, doesn't say a word to me, and takes over my barbell. I'm sitting just a few feet away when this gains hog thinks he can just overtake my setup. He was pretty big, built more like a powerlifter with significant body fat, but also very strong. I was dumbfounded. So speechless I couldn't even stand up for myself. I just sat there, mouth agape and watched as this guy took the gains that rightfully belonged to me. I managed to take a picture of the guy. Hopefully he sees this and realize what a punk he is.

 The trash talk is between KC/BAL and SF/LA. 




 Timmy will always be a lot of fans' favorite Giant. Not just because of what he did from 09-11 or in the 2012 playoffs, although that certainly helps, but because of his attitude. He's never complained about being sent to the bullpen or not getting enough work. He just works and pitches when he's needed.  




 [My gamer dog is not enjoying this one](http://imgur.com/RVVnBKi) 




 I've never seen a player who has struggled on the field yet be so loved by the fans as Timmy is.  




 Lincecum like "that's how you pitch in the post season, Clayton." 




 I still have to get a lifting session in tonight. Looks like I'll have some anger to get out.  




 Strickland is just garbage. 




 Maybe the Dodgers should build a better team then.

 I'm still trying to find a tasty one. I put olive oil and seasoning on the chicken and bake it @ 450 degrees for 10 minutes on each side. For the rice I just use a rice cooker and add a little soy sauce.  




 $5 pizza night. Only works on mediums.  




 I don't think Yogi left a lane for the runner. 




 Poop is gains leaving the body. I don't bother.  




 I'm celebrating with [3 pounds of chicken, 3 cups of brown rice, 3 medium pizzas]( http://imgur.com/J3zU4Um) and leg day (not pictured). May the gains be ever in our favor. 




 This is probably a stupid question, but I'm clueless in the kitchen. Do you put anything else in there with it or just plop 5 pounds of chicken in there and turn it on?  




 I have about 3 pounds of chicken that I need to cook and I'm wondering what the best way to do that are. In the past I've baked it and I've also experimented with grilling. Do you have a preferred way of cooking chicken?


Edit: I'll contribute an answer to my own question. I just baked 3 pounds worth at 450 degrees for 10 minutes on each side. I put a little bit of olive oil and seasoning on as well. It's pretty tasty when mixed with rice.  




 Who at the KC Star rejected "A Giant Disappointment"? 




 Prime Lincecum?  




 I feel like Hosmer was the kid in high school who was more popular than you, better at sports than you and got better grades than you, but you still like him.  




 Good morning ^good ^afternoon ^^goodnight 




 I gotta stay, the Giants fans in this thread are super annoying. 




 I know. Getting excited after a homerun in the WS? Sheesh...  




 Let's not compare Bumgarner to God. I mean, he's cool and all, but he's no Madison Bumgarner.  
























 A perfect job for a defensive minded coach. But where to find one of those...

 Spotify was huge for me. I just make a point to listen to a few new albums each week. I try to mix old artists with newer ones too. r/letstalkmusic has been a great resource too. I try to read a little bit about the artist while I'm listening and that usually leads to their influences, which opens up another opportunity to try new music.  




 How did the principle know whose grades to change?  




 [10] guy probably called it that. 




 When people make fun of you for liking those bands, they don't actually care or think any less of you for it. What they will think less of you for is if you act ashamed. Just own it and people will be cool with it. At work, I'm known as the music buff who sings along to Taylor Swift. Just accept that you like what you like and people will respect that.  




 Curious, can you get mineral oil at any store that has basic skin care products? I've never seen it.  




 Exactly. Javy Lopez was a huge midseason pick up in 2010 too.  




 He disappoints me every off season, but I'm happy in October.  




 And this is the one comment that doesn't have gold... 




 Tl;dr

What's my purpose?


Why am I doing this?


Who am I doing this for? 




 My friend, 22, is getting married next week. Like a chump, I waited until the last minute to get the couple a gift and everything on their registry has already been purchased. What can I give him that will be special? My max is $100. 




 How long does it take to get something tailored? I bought a jacket for a wedding on the 28th and the sleeves are just a little bit  too long.  




 I don't think so. Simple goals like reading 20 minutes a day, listening to new music every week or practicing an instrument every day are easily accomplished with a little discipline and go along way in improving oneself.  




 This isn't a genre or artist I'm familiar with but I've heard so many good things about it, so I gave it a spin today. Can't say I was too impressed. There's a lot going on, but nothing stood out as exceptionally catchy. I might have to listen to it again to make a better judgement.  




 Check out [this transformation]( http://m.imgur.com/gallery/bfoi2) by /u/nmp12.  I bet you could pull off something similar.  




 Why doesn't Vivek just coach the team himself? It's obvious he wants compete control anyway. Just cut out the middleman.  




 I really want to hear an explanation from Pete and Vivek. If they have someone like Karl or JVG linned up, then I won't be upset. If this firing is a result of Malone not living up to expectations, then this firing is outrageous. Look at this roster and tell me with a straight face that it's underachieving. Our best player has missed the last 8 games and we're still less than 2 games out of the 8th spot. I don't think there's a Kings fan alive who isn't pleased with the team's performance this year.


If Malone was fired because we weren't playing the ultempo style Vivek wants to see, then Vivek needs to go. It's about winning games, which we were doing for the first time in 8 years. Style counts for nothing.   




 The only way this makes sense is if ownership has been in secret talks with another coach and an agreement was made. Unless a George Karl announcement is made this week, this makes no sense. We haven't made the playoffs in 8 years and right now we're less than 2 games out of the 8th spot with our best player missing the last week and a half. No rational person can call that underperforming.  




 Or, you know, cover it on their TV channel.  




 1. I posted this over 2 hours ago.


2. As of 20 minutes ago, the last time I had the channel on, they were showing a special on dinosaur fossils.  




 Right now they're showing a program on dinosaur fossils.  




 Hostage situation in Sydney. CNN can barely be bothered to mention it.  


Edit: RIP my inbox. I get that it's on their front page now. It wasn't this afternoon when I made this comment. You don't all have to tell me the same thing. 




 They probably don't want the terrorists to be able to see what the police are doing on the outside.  




 Russell Wilson is the quarterback we hoped Kaep would be.  




 Only for 11 months of the year. As for October... 




 I'm surprised LA is willing to deal Kemp within the division. Especially since the Padres are a big bat or two away from being a really scary team.  




 She apologized and claimed her friend was on her Tinder. I laughed it off and then she unmatched me.  




 The conversation always starts at the bottom for me. Maybe it's different on iPhone.  




 I hate people who think they're better than Tinder.  




 I don't think he's boasting, but he clearly doesn't take driving drunk seriously.  









 "Should have had at least a dozen by now, so be it."


Fuck him if he thinks driving while drunk is a joke.  




 Came across her just now. Sacramento?  




 I bought a cheap one. It's so bad I don't even bother using it anymore.  




 It was briefly the name of what's now the Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento.  




 At least it's not Power Balance Pavilion. 




 *"Let's force a bunch of businesses to close on the busiest shopping day of the year. That will make people support our cause."* 




 It seems like we have talent at every position, but as a team we're absolute garbage. It's frustrating.

 This is supposed to be the Manning family, which happens to have 3 NFL quarterbacks in it. Archie, the father is long retired, but Peyton currently plays for the Denver Broncos and is easily one of the top 5 quarterbacks ever. His younger brother, Eli, is good, but nowhere near as good as Peyton. He also has a knack for throwing interceptions, when the opposing team catches his passes. 




 You mean you can't punch a police officer in the face and put your hands on his gun?  




 What is it about protests that make people think they can block off roads? Get out of the street! 




 Michael Brown was an asshole. The looters are assholes.  The arsonists are also assholes. OP never mentioned protesters. 


There are legit cases of systematic racism everyday in America, but this is not one of them. This is a case in which a man assaulted a police officer, tried to grab his gun, and was killed as a consequence of his actions. 




 Looks like protesters were sitting on the car's hood and the driver just punched it to get out of there.


I wish the video started a few seconds earlier.  




 Did you go out and ask them? According to CNN, the majority of the 61 arrests last night were Ferguson residents. 




 He's certainly popular, but I don't think he will be able to make it out of the primaries. 




 This morning, I heard talking heads on CNN blame everyone BUT the people of Ferguson for the riots. It takes a special kind of mental gymnastics to watch people burn their own city and then blame the police, outside agitators, the prosecutor, etc... 




 This is so irresponsible. Someone needs to be fired for this. 




 My work sells cheesecake. The last two nights I ate a slice at 520 calories a piece. I'm curious how bad it would be if 520 of my 3000 daily calories came from cheesecake if I did that everyday...hypothetically of course. 




 Hopefully he's able to play 3B for the rest of his career, because Sox fans won't be happy with having a DH who can't hit more than 15 home runs and .280. 




 Look what those racist cops made him say! 




 Freaking Jake Tapper always trying to protect female reporters. Let them do their job and trust their judgement to keep themselves safe. 




 It's justified because he assaulted a cop and tried to grab his gun. 




 Yet you're still watching... 




 Police should go home and let these people burn their city down. This is disgraceful! 




 It's the punching a police officer and reaching for his gun that did it. 




 And tomorrow they will blame police. 




 Word is that an announcement of indictment cannot be made unless the suspect is in custody. Darren Wilson has not been asked to turn himself in and an announcement is scheduled for about 10 minutes from now, so it can deduced that there will be no indictment. 




 This is going to be a shit show. 




 There will be no indictment, Ferguson will riot, protesters will blame police. Count on it! 




 Seriously! I don't know how anyone thought this was a good idea.  




 Well, what's the answer? 




 I'm nervous about our rotation. In the playoffs, MadBum was dominant, but everyone else struggled. A healthy Cain will help, but who knows what he will be capable of. Adding another reliable starter will be huge.  




 I'm gonna miss Pablo, but the reality of it is that he is a .280 hitter who has surprisingly little power for a man his size. As much as I like him, I don't think he's worth $100 million. If this means we get Lester, I think we come out ahead. 




 Supposedly Posey wants to catch. 




 We have $100 million to spend on free agents now, which can only mean Matt Duffy and Joaquin Arias will platoon 3B next year.  




 The guy didn't owe us anything. Boston is a great city with a good team. Let's just be happy for the good years we had with Pablo and even happier that we didn't overpay for him. 




 I'm sad to see Panda go, but glad we didn't shell out $100 million for him. If this means we can sign either Tomas, Lester or Headly, I think we're better off.  




 This is my biggest complaint about MFA, which is still one of my favorite subreddits. I see students asking for advice all the time and it never fails that people suggest the stereotypical MFA uniform. While an OCBD, dark cuffed denim and Allen Edmonds look nice, they're way out of place on a college campus, let alone high school. 


Someone once told me to dress 10% better than the average guy. That way, you look better, but don't stick out like a sore thumb. Given that I went to a university in southern California where the average guy wore a tank top, basketball shorts and flip flops, that wasn't hard. 


To me, dressing well is a combination of looking nice without looking out of place. There's a time and a place for the MFA uniform, but 11th grade isn't it. To be fair, it seems like this is less of an issue now than it was a year ago, but it's a beef I've always had with MFA. 


Sorry for the anti-MFA-circlejerk-circlejerk. 




 If they rejected everyone who had tried pot, there would be no military.

 *"I wonder if I'll be able to recognize Joe Torre as a k--there he is."* 




 So, he left his insurance info and a phone number with no area code, which could easily be figured out, and he wrote it on a whatever piece of paper he had on him, which happened to have a Bible verse on it? How exactly does this make him a scumbag?  




 The best one I've made is buffalo chicken. I cook about 1.5 pounds of chicken covered in a bottle of buffalo sauce and dry ranch dressing mix on low for 7-8 hours. Then I just shred it and eat it on a sandwich roll, usually with some broccoli on the side and milk to drink. It's delicious. 

I'm all about simplicity, so if a recipe has more than about 3 ingredients, I probably won't try it. Sometimes I'll just cook chicken breasts in water, shred them, and then mix it with brown rice. Chicken can also be slow cooked in beer, which gives it a different flavor. Check out /r/slowcooking for more recipes. They're a little more adventurous than me.  




 For the most part. I bought a slow cooker and I cook a ton of chicken in that. I also cook a lot of rice. If I cook 2 cups of rice and 1.5 pounds of chicken, I can get about 3 meals out of that, which I refrigerate and eat over 2-3 days. 

I also make breakfast burritos with eggs, hash browns and sausage. They're delicious, inexpensive and if I eat 2 of them and a glass of milk in one sitting, it's over 1000 calories. I only make about 8 at a time with 10 eggs, but I've seen guys prepare them by the dozen using 40+ eggs. Just wrap them in a paper towel and put them in Tupperware.  




 Are you preparing meals in advance? When you go to bed at night, you should know where your calories for the next day are coming from. If you're waking up and scavenging for 3000+ calories every day, you won't be able to sustain. 




 Nice progress. I love short term progress pics. It makes the future a little less daunting.

 Man, what I wouldn't do to discover AC/DC for the first time again... 




 They were playing a bar in my neighborhood a few months ago. I drank so much during the opening acts that my friend and I just decided to leave early. Regrets... 




 Ever since I started paying for Spotify, I've been listening to full albums while I lift. It's like killing two birds with one stone since otherwise I would just sit on my ass in my room and listen. I've been going through the White Stripes' catalogue recently. I think their self titled album and White Blood Cells are my favorite to lift to. 


If you like Hash Pipe, give their album Pinkerton a listen. It's my favorite Weezer album. I also keep going back to a band called Battleme. They're just the right pace for me to lift to. 


I also made [this playlist]( http://open.spotify.com/user/swolebuddha/playlist/1gQZicqZROQnFYsbQO0Zp7) of movie scores a while ago. It's good for when you want to feel like Batman while you lift. 




 9 players, 8 uniforms. 




 I highly recommended *All the Shah's Men*. It's perfect for someone who doesn't typically read history. It reads like a thriller, it's short enough that it doesn't get bogged down with minor details and it helps explain the way the world works today.  




 A hockey team will be, like the Kings were, nothing more than a toy for the Maloofs. They'll be excited at first, but then they will lose interest and neglect it. I wouldn't trust this family to own a pet, let alone a sports franchise.  




 A gentleman he is not.  




 Brother, if you ever break your arms, you better move out immediately.  




 Where do you usually go out? I'm almost always willing to go out, but I live in Auburn, so Sac is a little far for me to go regularly.  




 Yes. Part of the appeal of lifting is that it's something I can do alone that is still productive. It's not that I don't enjoy being social. It's just that it takes a lot out of me and I need to recharge. Lifting is something I can do to get my necessary alone time yet be productive, as opposed to watching Netflix.  




 If there's one positive from this season, it's that it looks like we have another stud linebacker.  




 I'm tentatively planning on being in downtown Roseville around 9:30. Probably at a place called the Opera House Saloon, but there are a few other bars in that area we can check out too.  




 You sound like the right guy to know. Are you over 21? We should hit some bars together. 




 I'm not set on a particular place. In the past I've had the most fun at the Opera House, but I'm open to going anywhere. Thinking 9:30-10ish.  




 My dad has fond memories of this Mac and cheese, but the recipe was never written down. I asked grandma, who now has a very poor memory, but she couldn't give me any exact measurements ("a whole gob of cheese", "a splash of milk", etc.). I did my best to recreate the recipe based on what she told me and it turned out pretty darn good.


Boil 2 cups of macaroni in salted water (grandma insisted that the water be salted)


In a baking dish, mix macaroni with approx. 1 cup of cheese. I used sharp cheddar.


Add 1/2 cup of milk

Bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees, stir, then bake for 10 more minutes. 




 I want those black Adidas Soccer pants, but they're so expensive. Is there an off brand alternative?

 I made a friend from Espoo while at school in San Diego, CA!  




 If my math is correct, it's about 1300 calories. 150 calories per 4 oz of chicken plus I put it on roles that are 130 calories each. I got 3 sandwiches from this batch of 1.6 pounds. I don't know about protein. 


I've seen other recipes that include butter or even cream cheese. That would add some calories if you're desperate.
