 No, I'm not a psychopath

 Just a joke, back in some of the early YogPods Simon would use the same voice, the "pubby" voice, and people would complain that it was racist or some shit 




 First few minutes of this video... so fucking racist :P 




 I beat the Asylum demon without dying and thought I was a God... but now I'm being decimated by poison in fucking Blighttown.  




 Don't tell OP what to do

Edit: dank scones for the downvotes for asking a question ho ho ho 




 if it helps I thought it was funny... just the mental image of this perma-cringed face, hilarious 




 guys, guys, guys, guys... hold up. you dont fucking downvote OP in his own thread. show a bit of respect. 




 Should make a self post about it 




 Jack is really entertaining in this episode 




 funny. it's counter culture 




 well there's no need to be rude about it  




 so OP posting his opinion   some criticism makes him an asshole? wtf? 




 fanboy alert 




 whatever 




 well ofc its subjective 

also maybe you just dont like satire? its not for everyone 




 thanks for explainin my joke, noone got it :P 




 um think i'd know what im doing best, thanks.

 I don't even know what "yer okie" means.

   If they're not a punk band then how would you classify them?

Alternative rock, but wikipedia says punk so fine I concede

 You do know that songs like Savior does not represent band's discography, right?

sure

 Did you not even listen to the link I posted?

skimmed it 




 generally what a sentence consists of, yes... 




 sure you can, but partying is detrimental and your intelligence will taper off at a point 




 whatever, you have misunderstood 




 they just fall into that category dude, dont expand your mind or anything, you aint learning if you're coked up listening to some dubstep malarkey 




 not for everyone else just trying to enjoy the music

also, rise against isn't punk 




 i dont think what redthatalready meant was in sexism but in opposition to the prevalent anti intellectualism (drugs electronic music parties extrovision) that is on the rise in the western world 




 Wish not death on your satan, but enlightenment to deliver them from ignorance. 




 Ah yes, the Top Gear lads, partying it up in their free time, destroying the environment in their working hours. 




 Work at Target for six years 




 Why? 




   I don't consider you human.

Ever stop to think that maybe you are no better than those you go against?

oh and don't downvote me either ever again 




 they won't but don't tell people what to do or they'll do the opposite 




 hey thanks for completely missing the point and winning karma by chastising me

i thought you guys liked satire? 




 well yeah because my satire deters them 




 'cause when this post gets more attention there will be an influx of people crying about sponsor only content, might as well fire off a preemptive ridicule in their general direction

 I cut off all contact with her, her family and our mutual friends. I did the best I could to remove my internet presence and pretty much became dead to that friend circle.

My breakup wasn't too bad, just generic compatibility issues. No hard feelings. 




 no it's funny cause he's stuck in the Ecuador embassy in London, so, like, who else is he going to have a press conference with? Drederick Tatum?  




 No Gavin?! ARGHHHHHH ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

Edit: 

satire
sat/
noun
the use of humour, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.

 Strippin is a damn traitor. Ditching his friends and moving to the US. Can't we just ignore this guy?

 That's not a bad thing! 




 Pretty sure I'm shadowbanned from /r/gaming, which is weird because I've never posted there prior to my ban. 




 Oh, sorry, I forgot that oh-so important politically correct term "in my opinion", oopsies.  




 How am I?  




 hey by posting that comment /u/Fiji_Artesian is just pointing out his favourite bit :) 




 He's not a teenager anymore, so he's FAIR GAME

Michael to everyone else: he is a fucking arrogant, lying, piece of shit. "oo I never said Jaws once", stfu, LOSER!

Michael is a psychopath, to think he's married. What a joke. Least he provides more entertainment than SOME members, though (eyes looking at you Narvarez Jr).

Insult to injury, Michael: "Gavin said Jars." REALLY?! 




 Missed the reference, eh? 




 A fedora would suit you. 




 Gavin: Remember his fleshlight?

Love how nobody responded to that out of fear of the backlash. 




  Esbrainrot, my brain rot, one-sixty, swiftly

Edit: forgot the fanbase is a bit to young to get that reference  




 yeah um I never want to see miles again 




 Hahaha, yeah bro, man, dude /s 




 Ah, alright. Thanks. 




 Black Widow is a cool character, really, I mean, she's attractive sure... but she's not just eye candies

 I don't care if this is fake, it's fucking funny. 




 And the tumblr user is ripping off Nintendo.  




 This is offensive.

 Did ya ever think it'd be so easy? 




 Hey, why shadowban me?  




 Hi, why am I shadowbanned?

Edit: kk looks like I AINT, ty

 Oh, shut the fuck up. 




 Hopefully you'll be judged by your merits and not your appearance
 




 Not sure if you're joking but you could just wear gloves to your job interviews and nobody will know 




 liar, it's summer.

 Leave out the bit about not reading the book, it undermines your entire opinion hehe 




 ... what the fuck? 




 whatever dude, I don't pander to the masses and censor myself 




 Nope! 




 That haircut is rad, what are you talking about? 




 Haha, wow. What an aggressive reply[!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzpndHtdl9A) 




  Be respectful of each other. This is not a place for hate. 




 careful mentioning other let's players in this sub

Edit: not that I have a problem with it personally, but I've seen people saying they enjoy the yogscast or whatever, and BAM, downvotes and rage

Edit 2: And my experimental first edit has proven this, mentioning the yogscast has tripled my downvotes. Nice! 




 no gavin? 




  Just because he doesn't make the same joke 815 times doesn't mean he's half assing.

lol 




 some sort of fetish of yours?

;'( ;'( ;'( ;'( ;'( ;'(

hope this helps 




 ;'(
 




 oops, I meant JJ, my bad 




 so many enraging things in this video.

Chris, that Jerry hick, an advert, Blaine, Gilby, a game of thrones spoiler, ~~Brandon~~ JJ, shameless shirt plugging, and a cliffhanger 




 man, he sounds so hurt at the end 




 hey dudeman it stands for Drunk Gamers - the website they had before doing RvB 




 oh man far out 




 Podcast crew... but um...? I don't... haha...



NO GAVIN?!? 




 tits are tits 




 Doesn't 




 Watch the video... proof is right there 




 Hopefully not, drunk people are annoying. Remember when Gavin was drunk in that Goat Simulator video? Got annoying fast, imo 




 No, you were pretty spot on 




 Haha, this is so sly. "Oh, look, Geoff is in this, wahoo." Then BAM! Lindsay.

I can smell the rage. 




  people here downvote for the dumbest shit 




 as long as one person finds it funny (me), then it's still subjectively funny 




 Ummm, subjectivity, bitch, look it up 




 Oh btw, Gavin bought a house

Edit: Obligatory woooooooooosh! The joke is that Gavin buying a house has been mentioned in like 20 things now 




 So glad that didn't end with the Loch Ness monster. Thanks for the reply! I always forget that for Americans to travel to Europe etc they're looking at an 8 hour flight. 




 Ehhh, not really, imgur links are more convenient and not many people will click a random tumblr link 




 Which country did he go to? 




 Gilby, I think 




 oh, a lot of us are boycotting russia for obvious reasons 




 Shame this game is set in Russia 




 Gavin is so tryhardy when it comes to alcohol 




 Yogventures, a game that was in development, was cancelled because it was pretty unrealistic or something, so now people who paid for it on kickstarter are angry.

Then there's some other thing called YogDiscovery which I've only found out about, apparently yogscast want indie devs to come to them, they'll make videos of the game and depending on how many views the video gets, and how many sales the game gets, yogscast will take a percentage of the profits from the devs.  




 that's a literary technique though 





























 Maybe if those jackasses would stop shooting his tires out... 




 he did 




 Do you like Huey Lewis and The News? 




 no gavin 




 Wonder what that acronym means?

 I mean he looks more likeable TO ME. Like MY high school fat best friend, early Jonah Hill style. Now he's more of a Seth Rogen and that is lame, IN MY OPINION.

Subjectivity, how does it work? 




 I mean he looks more LIKEABLE. Like your high school fat best friend, early Jonah Hill style. Now he's more of a Seth Rogen and that is LAME

Edit: heres  [$100$] now answer me, guy 




 caught ya whackin', eh? 




 It's hardly a binge if you're doing them 1 a day ;) 




 Yes, that's true. People respond to incentives. But, a worker is going to resent a boss who is mean and therefore put in less effort, meaning said employer will not benefit. A, maybe overly, kind employer will be well liked and workers will be more willing to put in effort, both parties benefit.

See Dale Carnegie's book, How to Win Friends and Influence People 




 If he is a good employer, he'll give you a raise or a bonus or something. Employers that treat their employees like shit get shit employees as a result. 




 arm chair gynecologist, back to /r/theredpill with you... 




 This has nothing to do with gender, I never disclosed mine 




 am not who you directed it towards, you'll need to write up a unique diagnosis for me, Bartlett 




 you're obviously not socially awkward then, that's the point i'm making. who told you you were socially awkward?
also don't call me names, this is a civil debate 




 arm chair psychiatrist  




 same thing 




  some girls are attracted to socially awkward guys, just like some guys are attracted to socially awkward girls.

You're thinking of "quirky" people, not socially awkward people. The two often get confused. Social awkwardness is a mental illness that makes any social interaction unbearable - no one with it could possibly form any romantic bonds.

 




 and you have a husband. you're about as socially awkward as frank sinatra was.

 did Van Gogh cut off his ear because his gf dumped him? 




 I kinda see what you mean, but I don't see what you mean 




 Any examples? I never really paid much attention to his tweets. 




 Kinda sick of him having blocked me on twitter, aswell. 




 Yeah but you don't downvote OP in his own thread, that's just rude 




 NO WAY DUDE 




 sat here wondering if that is why VG cut off his E? 




 You either wake up soon enough to be a hero, or keep dreaming long enough to be a villain.  




 DAS DA DOKE DOT DAY DEG 




 Ah, my bad. Haven't slept :) 




 You'd go way too fast unfortunately  




 NO WAY DUDE 




 is that why Van Gogh cut off his ear? 




 What's wrong with WND? 




 so that's why Van Gogh cut off his ear? Huh. 




 I know, its just one of those things 




 I get him and Brandon mixed up so its for the best 




 RUDE 




 obviously not what he meant 




 trust me, guy. it bothers them 




 he'd make a good Patrick Bateman 




 Yeah. The cake would cushion the blow anyway, no way what we saw in the video would knock her out 




 wishful thinking, guy 




 it is, getting slamdunked into cake wouldn't knock you out 




 more like strippin is traitor 




 dont tell me who i've never heard of 




 not sure about him, but i do, english not my mother tongue

 I always thought the "you shall have no other gods before me" was borderline crazy girlfriend territory where she doesn't want you having any other female friends.

 Gasoline evaporates extremely quickly, which quickly creates a volatile mix. It doesn't help that it's heavier than most atmosphere, so it tends to collect in pools instead of dissipating quickly.

Same!

 I know plenty, and know how to practically apply it, and I apply that knowledge in my every day life.

Are you a firefighter?

 You're the type of person that gets people killed, by not being prepared to handle situations as they come. Many situations won't be about your choice or what you did.

Yeah, so not my problem. 

 Say a car is on fire, and you need to decide how you're going to save a person out of it, will you be prepared to act?

Again, not my problem.

 I have no faith in you except sheer blind luck.

 Famous last words 




 white people 




 Well, my philosophy is growing innit. That's what debate is for.

And I'd consider news organisations integral to society, so BAM you get a car. 




 Cameraman for what sort of organisation? And yes, I'd say the majority of people need cars currently... but a lot are just lazy, you don't need to drive EVERYWHERE. 




 I am not a troll. I just don't censor my opinions. Think of it more as an experiment. How many redditors do you think trim down their comments to ensure they get positive karma? I'd say the majority. 




 I'd allow public transport in my world vision, but not that scabby gross public transport we have today. And I'd have security stationed on each bus or train or likes to deal with rabble rousers.

I'd allow access to cars for emergency service members, and government officials. And people with disabilities, such as wheelchair users (or I'd invent some wheelchair highway they can speed down). Everyone else must walk or cycle, or use the premium public transport. 




 yes it does dude

 Waiting for a friend when they are LATE, when I don't have any sense of TIME, and when I having nothing to DO. That's what I'm saying. Psychologically it is torturous. 




 Situation A (waiting on friend), you'd agree that is kind of torturous?

Situation B (trapped in car), that's like Situation B EXEMPLIFIED. I'd argue they are comparable in the sense that psychologically they are both strenuous.  




 You ever been waiting on a friend and they don't show for AGES, and you have no watch to check, no phone to pass the time? And it feels like time is going really slowly? That's probably what this guy was feeling, so I think saying he survived 2 months is completely fine. 




 It's closer to 1 month, yeah, but it may as well be 2 months. The poor guy was trapped in a car, fuck sakes, give him the benefit of the doubt. 




 43 days is roughly 2 months, stop being a pedant.  




 Not trolling, I just believe in a world where we all should respect each other. Thanks, though.
