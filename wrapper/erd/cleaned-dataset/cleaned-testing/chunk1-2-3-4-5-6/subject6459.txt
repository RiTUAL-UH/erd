 Journalists won't take pictures because they know they will be retaliated against if they do; in this report he said they might delay airing the report for their safety. I would be surprised if he's ever let in Gaza again. 




 So HOW should they do it instead? 




 Wary. They'll turn back to anti-semitism as soon as their preachers have a change of heart. 




 If true, this would give an almost 1:1 militant to civilian ratio, which is in line with previous conflicts in the Gaza strip. The Gaza Health ministry run by Hamas say that there has been 1,900 dead, of which 80% or so are civilians. 









 He meant 96% of West Bank civilians, under areas A and B. 




 Because, legally, as soon as the charge is brought Israel can counter charge the PA with much worse. 




 To add a bit too this, the "character" of God in both Islam and Judaism are almost the same, so much so that it is universally agreed within Judaism that Muslims worship the same God. It's a debate whether Christians are polytheistic or not. 




 It's a midrash that Muhammed took and incorporated into the Qur'an. 




 To add to Lazer_Taxon, the evangelicals in America are the greatest "bloc" support of Israel -- but only because they believe it will hasten the second coming. As soon as their preachers switch back to anti-Semitism, 15% of America will go back to hating Jews again. 




 A quote without a source! Might it be pulled out of your ass? 




 It is no no longer a war crime if it is used as a military site, which is what Hamas is doing to this hospital. So Israel is going to bomb one building, not the whole thing, once all the civilians leave. 




 maddoweis.net

Nice joke, hilarious! 




 Older people saw the international Palestinian terrorism during the cold war, and educatikn teaches you is not as simple as casualty numbers. 




 To get a different perspective about the letter, read this:

I'm going to try to re-translate the letter myself and see if it comes out differently.

 Kidnap. If they're not allowing Red Cross visits or abiding by the Geneva Conventions, it's kidnapping. 




 The attack came less than 2 hours into the "ceasefire." 




 Please change "they" to "Hamas", you don't know how stupid some people are.

Edit: People upvoted my comment, I guess that works just as well. 




 Soldiers are captured if they are allowed visits by the Red Cross and the captors follow the other Geneva Conventions related to POW's. Hamas doesn't, so the soldier is kidnapped.  




 THe army went in the day that Hamas militants first attacked from one of these tunnels. Unless you think Israel controls Hamas... 




 The tunnels going into Israel cannot be used to transfer goods, they are only to attack Israel. 




 http://this-is-not-jewish.tumblr.com/post/34344324495/how-to-criticize-israel-without-being-anti-semitic 




 There are actually a lot of reports that ground troops are really frustrated that, though they are finding lots of tunnels and booby-trapped houses, they can't get the people shooting at them. 




 Wow, great rebuttal. I'm impressed. 




 Not quite yet. It will if Israel decides to go further. 




 For the 10th time, [Haaretz live blog at 7:45pm.](http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.607945) I couldn't submit it because as a live blog it was already submitted. 




 Correct me if I'm wrong

You are wrong. All of the tunnels that Israel is destroying now are ones leading into Israel to conduct terrorist attacks. The IDF only put boots on the ground in Gaza after the attack from one such tunnel. 




 ...what? Because this is true. 




 Um, no?

This is the "Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War."

This specific section is "Wounded and sick IV. Discontinuance of protection of **hospitals**" [emphasis added]

If you want to prove your point, find a general article, or at least one that doesn't mention that it's specifically for hospitals

  




  Yet they didnt do it last time they had chance, nor ever before.

When was this time? They've only attacked sporadically from tunnels after it was clear that the IDF is going to destroy them so Hamas won't be able to use them in the future. 

The tunnels were stupidly not taken as a big danger by the government until now. If one attack happened from a tunnel and casualties resulted, Israel would immediately invade Gaza and destroy them. They could only be used once/in one military operation.

They dont need 10 people kidnapped, they can get the equal attention by a single guy or a couple.

No, they need as much people killed and kidnapped as possible, for popularity, money, and exchanges.
 




 Unfortunately, there will be no journalists in the area because it's an active military zone and ground fighting. No confirmation from other completely unbiased sources will have to wait. 




 If Israel is destroying everyone and everything, they're doing a horrible job at it. I'm sure that given 3000 bombs the US could level Gaza within a few hours. 




 And everything else is just a claim by Hamas. Do you actually expect journalists to report every detail about military operations from an active military zone? 




 http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_cha_chapter4_rule14 




 So if I shoot at you many times but either miss or hit your bulletproof vest, you'll just sit there and take it? 




 Good, now you're reading! Not quite enough though. This is only regarding hospitals, **not UN shelters.** Find another article to support your claim. In addition, the only time Israel has deliberately bombed hospitals is with imminent military activity or large stores of weapons and warnings. 




 Purpose? To massacre and kidnap Israeli civilians. This achieves many of their goals at once. 




 No, the censor doesn't provide false info. Does the IDF itself? Very possibly, many militaries do. 




 It was formed specifically for Palestinians because of the creation of tons of Palestinian refugees when the ~~general assembly granted Israel the land~~ war broke out between Israel and the surrounding Arab countries, including Palestinians. There would have been no refugee problem without the war.

And really, the ones in the West Bank and Gaza (especially the latter) should not be called refugees. 

1. No other population has refugee status transferred to children.

2. Those under the control of the PA and hamas are free to move around in their territory, they don't have to stay in refugee camps. But it presents a better image to the world and continues their claim, so they stay. 




 Haaretz specifically mentions it, and I've linked to it a bunch of times here. 




 No, initially it was reporting (and still is) 70-80% civilian casualties,  "among them" women and children. Easy to be misled though, with how it's reported. Currently, [by the washington post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/world/gaza-counter/), about 1/10 are women and 1/5 are children under 18. Women make up 50% of the populace, while children make up around 50-60%

Your source is the top end, the UN is reporting 3:1 or 4:1, and the IDF is saying between 1:1 and 2:1. But for now, these high numbers will be used to bash Israel as much as possible while the reports in 3 months will be brushed under the rug. 




 I'm saying that there is one refugee organization for the Palestinians and one for everyone else. It's not racist, but it is a double standard. 




 Eh, state actors are still expected to minimize casualties if possible. 




 The journalists know the full news, even if they can't publish it. Again, they wouldn't publish something false deliberately. 




 85% is a 1:5.5 ratio, and I'm sure it will go down right after the fighting is over and Hamas announces their martyrs. It doesn't change the fact that lots of civilians are suffering though. 




 Oh, Israel has done a lot wrong. There just happens to be (or was) an Israeli peace movement, but not a Palestinian one. It sucks. 




 "Terrorism" or not, they are still a military target. And rockets are purposefully attacking civilians with the purpose of committing genocide, even if they suck at it. 




 Because logistically, it's impossible to bring stuff in and out more than once without Israel noticing. 




 Reading comprehension alert:

the presence of small arms and ammunition taken from such combatants and not yet handed to the proper service, shall not be considered to be acts harmful to the enemy.

these are neither "small arms and ammunition" nor have they been "taken from combatants."  




 Saving your comment! 




 The first rockets and war with Gaza (2006) was before the blockade took effect. Lifting it now would only cause a free flow of weapons into the strip. 




 They are currently hiding in the network of tunnels built instead of  hospitals and bomb shelters. So brave. 




 He has reported for The Jerusalem Report, the Forward, the Wall Street Journal and WRNI among others

Nice selection bias. Most Israelis serve in the IDF that doesn't mean anything.

 




 Great response :P 




 Ok, provide proof if you think otherwise. 




 So what should Israel do instead? 




 What do you mean, stupid? During a lull in the fighting when Israel is not  expecting it, possibly during a holiday, they break out of 8-10 tunnels near towns. Then they murder and kidnap as many people as possible before escaping. 




 If there is military activity in the area, it becomes a legitimate military target even if it is a declared safe zone. It then comes down to the amount of civilian casualties vs. military benefit like any other target. Doesn't make it a war crime to do so unless the civilian casualties are extremely excessive. 




 The first two were written before the full news came out, as did Haaretz. Haaretz then published an update after the full information was cleared for publishing. 




 Again, this is less than a mile from the boarder with Gaza and is constantly monitored. The only reason that they weren't discovered until now is because they are closed at the top until the militants attack. Why wouldn't they just use the Egypt ones they have? Why use thousands of tons of concrete for these and not the ones into Egypt? 




 The 8:1 ratio. 




 That's because it's an organization with helps refugees -- but only Palestinian ones. 




 Haaretz has it too, is that any better for you? It is still coming from the IDF in the end.

I think Israel has made numerous mistakes for this assault, and I'm still waiting for an explanation of the bombing/shelling of the market and school today. That doesn't mean that Israel is committing genocide or deliberately killing civilians. 




 Just think about the logistics of transferring goods into Israel, to the border which Israel is constantly watching, and then bringing those goods into the tunnels and out the other side. You really think this was ever done? 




 How many months did it take to build this tunnel while it was being used? You think the UN employees didn't know about it? 




 Cite the 8:1 source, which means only 1 out of every 9 people killed is civilian. The most I've seen (out of the Hamas run health agency!) is 4:1, and sometime 3:1. They've claimed similar numbers before, but when the dust has settled down it usually comes to around a 1:1 ratio, and I am expecting the same to happen this time. 




 I would love to be paid for this! I would be making so much money right now. :P 




 [It also has lots of credible journalists.  
](http://www.timesofisrael.com/about/)
 




 where, link? You're claiming two things in this thread and citing no proof. 




 Do you have a link to the last? Hebrew is fine. 




 Not yet. I bet Hamas' plan was to attack from all of them at once, but they didn't get the opportunity before the fighting started. 




 Read Haaretz every day and then say that no one ever criticizes the IDF. 




 The tunnels into Egypt are for smuggling, but it's not like Hamas can transfer goods into tunnels in Israeli territory. Why do you think they're building tunnels into Israel, [most of them near civilian towns](http://i0.wp.com/www.jewishpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IDF-map-of-TerrorTunnels.jpg?fit=485%2C485)? 




 No Israeli newspaper will deliberately print false information. [The US had a censorship office during WWII as well.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Censorship) 




 Haaretz current live blog at 7:45 

http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.607945 




 Well, the post is gone now and it wouldn't allow me to comment *shrug*

Unfortunately, no international news source is publishing info like this as fast or as thoroughly as Israeli news sources are. It would be nice if CNN or other international publications produced the detailed reporting that ToI and haaretz is doing, but they don't have the audience for it.

The IDF might be wrong, but there is no source for this outside the IDF anyway, and any news organization would have to source them. That doesn't answer why you think ToI is run by the IDF. 




 Because the UN workers live in a culture where they are under threat by Hamas and it's much easier to look the other way than than speak out, especially when you came to help Palestinians anyway and your boss is doing the same. 




 This Israeli censor doesn't provide false information, only prohibits some news to be released for a time. 




 Because you can call a building empty, but if Israel tries to bomb it as a legitimate military target than civilians in the two other buildings can be hurt/killed. 




 And what about haaretz?

http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.607945 at 7:45 




 Building underground is easier than building above ground, really? I guess we're just really inefficient then, and we should all live in hobbit holes!

Plus, there is still quite a lot of empty land is gaza to build on, just look at google maps. 




 It comes from an IDF general stating what 800,000 tons of concrete could build; that is just math. Why do you think that ToI is any more "run by high ranking IDF members" than any other Israeli news site.

Edit: ~~Since you deleted your comment downthread~~ since your comment was deleted...

OP here, not a shill. I am Israeli, and started posting when I began to be disturbed by all the shit that gets posted here. I'm actually a leftist and would gladly vote for Meretz if I trusted Palestinian people/leadership, but like 95%+ of Israeli Jews I support this operation. I will need to look at what is said about the shelling of the school and market today, as well as some other things that happened;  like the "IDF bombing" of the school a few days ago which turned out to be an Islamic Jihad misfired rocket. I can't say anything about that now though, or I would contribute to the "Israel is a genocidal baby murderer" meme here. People can't seem to understand that it is neither in Israel's strategic interest, not do they want to, kill civilians. 
























 I hears reports of at least 13 Hamas members captured or surrendering. Is this possibly one of the goals of the ground invasion, maybe for intelligence purposes, or just a fluke? I don't remember any reports of captures members in 2006 or 2008. 







































 I've been fasting since early this morning; no food and no water. Since starvation mode is activated when you eat too little, I'm wondering exactly when it starts? I would really like some free energy right now. Anyone have tips to make it begin? I'm starting to feel weak...

Edit: oy, Poe's law. In case people didn't get it, this is satire. I am really fasting though. Thankfully it ends soon after sundown. 




 A UN agency recently announced that around 75% the Palestinian casualties in Gaza. Is this correct, or is it just the UN again? If it is true, why is it higher than the 1:1 ratio in the previous two Gaza operations? 









 Jesus very obviously did not fulfill the important messianic prophecies which people associate with the Messianic age. [\(A small list.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/wiki/jesus) The usual counterargument is that Jesus will return and and fulfill all of them in the second coming. But if I don't believe in Jesus in the first place, why should I assume this? The Messiah will be the person who brings in the Messianic age -- if he dies before doing so, then he cannot be the Messiah ([see Bak Kokhva an example](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt)).

So can you prove from the Tanach (Old Testament) that the Messiah will either die before fulfilling the prophecies or come back to Earth after dying? I reject the validity of the New Testament, so unless you want to try to prove that first, it won't be very productive to argue from there.

 




 I know this thread has probably been posted many times in the past, but I have two specific questions I don't have answers to.

1. Why do Muslims think that the text of the Tanach (the Torah, Prophets, and Writings) was corrupted? I know that there is a su'rah (is that the right term?) claiming such, it would be nice if someone could quote it. But I would also like to know how parts are determined to be corrupted and how it happened. Is it just assumed to be the stuff that contradicts the Qu'ran? [I had a small discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/29de5y/islamic_view_on_jews/cik3of9) with /u/possiblea2m about it, but he couldn't follow up on the final answer he gave me, so I clarification on that would be nice as well.

2. Do all Muslims believe that the current Jews are not related to B'nai Yisrael? I was told a such by /u/Redhawk1000 [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/29de5y/islamic_view_on_jews/cijzcnq), but he didn't finish answering my questions. If yes, why? When did the split/loss occur? If no, why is are the quotes wrong? (I have very limited background in Arabic, so please provide translation if you can. Interlinear/transliteration is even better.)

Oh and one minor question I recently thought of. Do the Qu'ran record any prophets in the line of Ishmael (edit: besides Muhammed)? I haven't seen any referenced, but that doesn't mean there aren't.

Thanks in advance for answering! Feel free to ask me any questions about Judaism as well. 

   /May you find peace. 




 My computer is a Dell Inspiron 1440, running windows 7. My computer was slowing down after longer periods of use (over an hour), especially while playing games. I asked here on the live chat what I could do to improve performance and was given various good suggestions. Now, I consider myself somewhat knowledgeable about software if not hardware (I know, I know, I lot of people say this, but I have a little experience programming), so my computer was already clean of malware and I had been disabling unneeded programs running in the background. After trying some of the minor suggestions, I decided to clean the fan when I downloaded Coretemp and realized my computer could run up to 190 degrees F even when only using internet and video chat when in a 70 degree room. After seeing this, I decided to clean the out the fan and make sure nothing was wrong with parts of the computer.

I watched a video on how to disassemble the parts, and it was a great learning experience! Unfortunately, in order to access the fan, I had to take out the motherboard as well instead of just the keyboard and outer case. The fan was indeed dusty, though not quite as bad as other pictures I looked at online. I cleaned the fan using a small vacuum and cloth, cleaned the motherboard of dust with compressed air, and wiped down the non-electrical parts of the computer. I made sure I was very careful, remembered where all the parts and wires connected, and kept track of all the screws and various other parts while taking the laptop apart and putting it back together. The only part I know I might have made a mistake on is the order of the two large chips in the bottom of the computer (Maybe the RAM? I don't know what they're called...taken out at 1:05 on this video:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulecDVBnDwc. Would switching them actually change anything?)

Now my computer turns on, but the screen stays off and after about a minute it starts beeping 4 times in a row every 5 seconds. What could I have done wrong, and what are my options now? I did a full backup right before disassembling, so worst come to worst I guess I'll have bring it to a repair shop and they could fix it and wipe it. Any advice for me, r/techsupport?  




 A common argument I've seen for the validity of Jesus as the Messiah is that he was unique in certain respects. Usually, the twin claims are that he committed no sin and that he performed many miracles, including raising himself from the dead. Putting aside the former claim, (because of the unverifiable nature and that there is no reason for a Messiah to be sinless), why do the miracles make Jesus unique. The Bible clearly states in Deuteronomy 18 to be vigilant against false prophets who will turn people away from the proper worship of God. These prophets will "perform signs and wonders" to prove themselves, and God tells the people not to trust just because they perform miracles.

So why are Jesus' wonders used so often as proof of his status as the Messiah/divine? And are there any other reasons to believe that Jesus was a unique human?

We can also discuss the sinless claim if someone brings a verse to show the Messiah must fulfill that requirement. Please don't bring into the argument that he was God as well, because not only is that impossible to argue about, it doesn't answer my question. 














 Can anyone explain to me what exactly is the reason that minhag is taken so seriously in the orthodox world? I've heard people talk about minhag like they do about kashrut. Some really weird practices are justified as minhag, sometimes so much so that people refuse to change them. Why is it taken so seriously both culturally and halachically? 

I went to Orthodox day school, so feel free to give me sources. 









 Is there any knowledge of specifically how parasites control the behavior of their hosts? What parts of the brain do they affect? Do they block or add neurotransmitters? Does the method change among species? For example, I know some wasps use venom, but fungi or bacteria probably use different means. Links or books to read further on this topic are also greatly appreciated. Thanks! 




 I recently bought Awakening, and absolutely loved it. I owned Path of Radiance and played it when I was younger multiple times. Then I bought Radiant Dawn some years ago and played once, and now I'm playing it again when I rediscovered FE with Awakening. Once I'm done with RD, what game(s) in the series should I play next, and how can I get it? I have a 3DS, a DS, and a Wii, and a computer (:P). Thanks! 




 I was a really big Pokemon fan when I was younger. I played the first and second generations to death, starting multiple games over again so I could experience the thrill of training my pokemon from scratch and beating all the gyms for the first time. I then tried my hand at emerald for a it after it came out, but for some reason I couldn't really enjoy it and stopped after a while. I did the same for Pokemon black, and even almost made it up to the Elite Four, but I didn't understand a lot of the new pokemon, moves, or any of the background stuff. 

I just got a 3DS and a copy of Pokemon X for my birthday, and I want to play and understand, and enjoy it! I'm really excited about the new generation since it seems really immersive. I'm not really interested in the competitive scene nor spending hundreds of hours breeding the best pokemon, but I do want to know how to better train the ones I catch! 

So what's new? What are EV's, how do battles with multiple pokemon flow, did B-down to catch a pokemon ever actually work (I'm still going to use it anyways!), etc. Educate me, please! 
























 The half blood prince, fantastic? I hope you're being sarcastic...

or some reason they decided to jump on that and focus more on the relationship drama and less on the actual storyline.

whelp, that might be why. The relationship drama is the storyline, even in the book. 




 This probably wouldn't be in the shulchan aruch, but is there any discussion on what a mourner who goes to two different shacharit services on the same day should do? That is the closest to this situation.

 




 You can say that as many times as you want. I have it open and don't see that. I'm in siman 55. Can you point to where it says that saying kaddish with less than 10 is assur, or where saying a d'var sh'bikdusha with less than 10 is assur?  




 You are saying it is assur, but I'm looking at the mishnah brura and it doesn't mention assur anywhere. Is it preferable to say it with a minyan? Yes. Must a minyan say it? Yes. But nowhere does it say it is assur if there is not a minyan. Again, it's great you're studying it, but I haven't, so if you could please cite your sources it would be very helpful. 

This doesn't even get into the difference of saying it to yourself versus a public declaration among less than ten. 




 Alright, I see  , but no assur. I also see no discussion on what a single person can or should do. I also see that a Katan does suffice for the tenth, unlike kedusah, meaning this is on a lower level. (Actually, I think I might have misinterpreted this--it's unclear whether these are laws for just kaddish or also brachu, kedusha, etc.) From my limited knowledge is seems totally fine to say the words of the kaddish by yourself, but it does not yotzei you.

Maybe the Aruch Hashulchan discusses it, but I can't look right now. 




 Don't worry about it. We're having an argument on the fine points of a specific law.

A minyan is ten Jewish men by Orthodox standards, ten Jewish men and women according to more liberal movements. Those of us who are more liberal/egalitarian also say there is no difference between men and women in this.

Edit: Just because the most stringently observant on here say certain things doesn't mean they are always true for everyone. :P 




 One second, the kaddish doesn't even have Hashem's name. What is the difficulty? 




 thanks. Unfortunately I only have the Mishna Brura and Rambam here.

Edit: Oh, you are referring to the mishna brura! stupid latin letters... 




 Is there a source? Also, remember the principle of teaching when saying God's name. 




 Some synagogues do sell them. If they don't, they can definitely refer you to someone else who does. 




 That's very appropriate. :) 




 It's not a mitzvah to do it, but I do not believe it is forbidden.
 




 Hmm, I thought you said Lamarckism, and Lyskenkoism seemed to be a political structure that used it as a basis. So to be clear, I'm talking about the heritability of acquired characteristics.

I'm also a layman, so I can't say very much; I'll explain it simply with more technical words in parenthesis, since I don't know your knowledge level. The basics of it that I know is that experiences (stimuli) over the course of an organism's life can change whether genes are turned on or off (expressed). Since genes are usually just codes for a cell to make proteins, expression simply means whether or not the specific proteins are made.  This is mostly caused by the way the genome is folded/held together. 

For example (and this might be relevant for people here), the gene for lactose tolerance in adults can frequently stop being expressed (i.e. the protein it codes for stops being make) if you stop drinking milk. So an adult with lactose tolerance who does not drink milk for a few months would find it difficult to start again because there are no more proteins to break it down.

The theory is that the expression of genes, in addition to the genes themselves, can also be passed down by parents. How exactly it works I'm not clear about. It's not Lamarckism in its original and expansive form, but it does share similarities. 




 Well, an altered version of it has been making a comeback recently. 




 You can also say the Mourner's Kaddish if you want -- it's a prayer in Aramaic, but most prayer books have it transliterated. You might or might not find it meaningful.  

Edit: [Here's a link](http://www.jewfaq.org/prayer/kaddish.htm) to the Hebrew, English, and transliteration. [Here is wikipedia's explanation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaddish#Mourner.27s_Kaddish).

Edit: Also forgot, is there any site or sub were I can learn more about my heritage?

That's what this sub is for! Read the wiki and people would be happy to answer your questions. I also recommend jewfaq.org

 Look up the 48, 67, and 73 wars. A ceasefire was only put into place once Israel started winning. 




 There are two different interpretations. 

'We must never again allow a genocide to happen."

Vs.

"We will never again be like sheep led to slaughter." 




 And I'm saying that this "he" refers to all of mankind. My support is that seed is always plural, and that both Adam and Eve are referred to as you when it refers to all their descendents.  




 It doesn't say anywhere that the "suffering servant" would be pierced, nor that the suffering would "bring" salvation. 




 Other biblical texts clearly identify the snake with Satan (i.e., Revelation)

Fan fiction, doesn't count.

The text specifically says that your head shall be crushed -- not a generic snake, not the snake's descendant, but that particular snake.

It also says you to Adam and Eve, and that clearly refers to them and their descendendants. Why is this different?

There seems to be a particular descendant referred to by the "seed" -- it's a singular "he" who will do the crushing, etc.

"seed" always means "descendents" in the Bible. Is there a time it is not plural that you can point out? 




 Oooo, oooo, I know this one! Hocus, pocus, [balobocopypaste](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/29dzp2/why_is_jesus_always_depicted_as_being_white/cikvnv9)!

Isaiah 53 is very clearly talking about the Children of Israel, though it is obscured by the way Christians separated the chapters. If you look at 52: 13-15 (which is the same section that starts with chapter 50), you can see that the prophet introduces a "servant" in third person. 13 says that the servant will be exalted, 14 that (in past tense) "marred beyond man is his appearance," 15 that (in future tense) how kings and nations will react.

Then, in 53:1, the narrative shifts to the perspective of those kings and nations, who are talking about the servant after he has risen and exalted. In the past, "he had not form," "he was despised," etc. But now "He has grown," "he might see offspring," etc. Then in the second half of verse 11 the narrative shift back to prophet, who describes the servant a bit more.

Now how is it possible that, during the time the prophet was speaking, Jesus was already marred, and that nations were appalled (did this ever happen?). Only in the future will the nations say "As one who hid his face from us, he was despised, we held him to no account." Did they ever say this about Jesus? If you read the entire section, chapter 53 is actually the pivot between a mourning Israel/Jerusalem and a joyous one, it makes sense why Israel would be referred as a "suffering servant" here. 




 Vanilla morrowind was good for its time, but modded morrowind is amazing. This is from someone who only started playing a few months ago. 




 Has Hamas not essentially declared war on Israel? Or did they provoke Israel into declaring war on them?

Hamas' declaration of war with Israel is in its founding document. This recent violence between Israel and Hamas began with Hamas firing rockets, yes.

Either way... if one side continually declines a ceasefire, how can the other be held accountable for any casualties of war? Surely Israel would prefer to not catch any civilians in the cross fire, but if their opposition chooses to fight shoulder-to-shoulder with civilians, then what option do they have?

Good question, ask all the Hamas supporters around here.

That said, I'm disappointed in Israel's strategy; why not attempt to use Hamas' tactics against them? Spread the word that Hamas leaders/militants only intend to use your (civilians) lives as sand bags and blast shields. Consistently and constantly plea with civilians to flee. Offer salvation and safety on the border, risk Israeli lives to save those that are disenfranchised by the Hamas - let the world see Hamas firing on their own fleeing peoples... on IDF trying to help civilians leave.

They've done all of this, doesn't change a bit.

On another note, why not attempt to gas such a densely populated area, where there is no realistic escape for your enemy, with a sedative? Get in, grab civilians, capture Hamas militants. Rinse and repeat as needed. Can't we do something besides lobbing bombs at one another? Not much of a farcry from trebuchet times - where the Homo Sapien species barely understood... anything.

New headline when a 90 year old tragically dies: "Israel is gassing Gaza!"

What is Israel doing to ensure civilian's safety, aside from giving them notice that they're about to drop bombs all over their neighborhood? Is it so much to ask that the IDF stick their necks out? What if Gaza was packed with Israelis instead?

A house is typically only bombed after a call and warning "knock." The IDF *does* stick its neck out -- it doesn't have to send soldiers into Gaza, it could get everything done by air, but with severe civilian casualties. Then you would see an actual 80-90% civilian casualty rate. 




 No, no, israelnationalnews is the best website ever!!  




 The Zionists were a terrorist group to the world.

Citation needed. Zionist leaders welcomed in the US say otherwise.

The Zionists believe in one state for Israel and control of the entire holy land.

Citation needed.

After the British left the Zionists turned their focus on controlling the holy land.

No, there didn't happen to be a civil war right before they left and armies invading afterward.

They gained control by forcing native Israelites out of the land if they weren't Jewish.

Yes, yes, that's why Israel has always had a 20% Arab population, right?

The people forced out still felt a right to the land since they were on it since the ancient Hebrews.

Arabs have only been there since the 7th century; they're proud of that conquest too.

Six Day War occurred and people ignored that the new Israel state has grown past the partitioned lines it was. given.

"Occured" is such a lovely word, isn't it? Allows you to ignore why Israel conquered those territories.

The people in Gaza form Hamas in order to get the land they felt was theirs.

This ignores all history between 1967 and 2005, lucky you. 




 The battles 60+ years ago were to kick all the Jews out. Hamas is still fighting for that. 




  The grievance being that the Zionists when taking over Israel forced the native Jews and Arabs to assimilate or out of the state into Gaza and the West Bank and thus created the tensions that aren't being absolved today.

This is so incredibly simplistic to the point of being wrong, I don't even know what to say. 

I think that just because Hamas is bad doesn't make the grievance any less important.

Their grievance is that there are Jews in the area at all. If you agree with that, you are condoning them. 




 So are they fighting today's battles or the ones from 60 years ago? 




 Ah, so you agree with them? 




 You do realize that there was no siege until the rocket fire started? And that it will end once the strip is demilitarized?  




 They call all of Israel "occupied." Get your head out of your ass and realize they want to ethnically cleanse the area of all Jews.

 Probably less so than ynet and jpost, which are posted here all the time. 




 And when people ask why everyone can't just stop shooting and live together peacefully, this is the answer. 




 They didn't publish that any more than reddit publishes self posts. The guy signed up for a blog before, and spewed some racist shit on it which the editors removed and then banned him.
 




 It wasn't even an op ed, just a random blogger who they host. 




 How about the fact that they didn't publish anything anymore than reddit does? The guy signed up for a blog before, and spewed some racist shit on it which the editors removed. 




 jewfaq.org is good for reviewing things you might have forgotten, but it doesn't go in depth. 




 As long as there is a giant explosion and darkness when it hits the ground. 




 No idea. Maybe the yeshivish people here can explain it? 




 So your argument is that the method of execution (stoning) is immoral? Again, define your argument. 

Your example is like saying you forced someone into an electric chair and electrocuted them, and by the laws of Oklahoma that is ok. :P That's murder, not execution.

That's a moral execution, which isn't murder, and the bible didn't say to put the person on trial, but to just do it, so no laws broken.

Notice the example given has a trial first. The bible does say there and elsewhere that there has to be a trial before an execution.

Job is clearly an allegory, and one way of saying that we cannot necessarily find a reason for suffering. 

How much longer until you agree that stoning is a torturous way of ending the life of another person,

I disagree.

and that it wouldn't be ok for anyone to order it be done.

I agree! 
 




 Oh, not a full takeover, but a limited one just near the border. The "I keep bombing you as long as you shoot rockets" and "I will keep the blockade until you get rid of the rockets" are pretty strong cards in my opinion. 




 Nope, it was the air force, not the navy.  




 No it isn't - you don't get a free pass to kill as many human shields as you like. Proportionality still supplies. You can't kill a hundred civilians to destroy one rocket being hidden in the same building, for example.

True. Most people mistake a war's proportionality for a strike's proportionality though. I have yet to hear of one airstrike killing one hundred civilians.

Isn't that just a tu quoque?

No, since this is said to people calling for Israel to stop bombing. Why should Israel be held to a standard that no other western country is? 




 You try doing so from an airplane or drone 1000 feet up in 15 seconds using heat imaging. 




 I'm not, I'm letting you define the scenario. Who are you aiming at? 




 Right so what we should stick to Palestinian endgame of forcing all the colonists to go elsewhere and the rest of the Jews to live as second class citizens, seems fair.
 




 And if you shot at someone you would be arrested. 




 What about all the Arab states that kicked the Jews out? Should they be forced to take them back too? 




 Then yes, you are using the family who lives in that house as a willing or unwilling human shield. And who are you firing at? Soldiers of a dictator are very different than civilians of an enemy state.
 




 Israel said that it targeted a militant site, and it was thought that the kids were Hamas fighters running from the shelling.  




 Israel won't accept it though. Since Israel withdrew voluntarily and is ready to return to Gaza if need be, Israel holds most of the cards. 




 What was the other peace process in which Bill Clinton intervened?

Oh, [right](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords), that [one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_David_Accords). 




 The boys on the beach was a mistake, and Israel admits that. Unless it was fired knowing that they were all children, then it's not a war crime. War is brutal, and maybe Hamas shouldn't have started this one.

And none of those three schools were actually targeted. 
 




 Maybe just maybe there were actually many rockets fired from Gaza. 




 120 years' worth 




 Responsible for the action, yes. Responsible for the result? It depends. And certainly the person putting the civilians in harm's way can't be the one doing the complaining. 




 The rule 97 that I quoted from. And what is your point? Proportionality does not relate to overall casualty figures, and I would like you to prove that israel is not taking precautions in attacking. 




 You're just avoiding the question. What should Israel do in that scenario?  




 You can't blame the opposing force for killing the civilians you're hiding behind. 




 Yes, but you would usually not keep a crowd of civilians behind you while you are attacking, for two reasons.

1. You care about your people.

2. The tactic only works when the other side also cares about not killing them.

I'm not disputing hit and run tactics, but doing them next to civilians, whether they are willing or not.. 




 Um, yes it is? It might not be permanent, but it is being used for military purposes. 




 I'm pro-Israel and I mostly agree! I would like to comment on a few things though:

With that said, they have at times acted carelessly and overly aggresively. Their response of "Hamas is worse" does not suffice, because a legitiamte state should hold itself to a higher standard than an extremist group.

The response is not "Hamas is worse" but "since Hamas is using human shields, we are not at blame when those civilians die," which is true, legally, under the Geneva Conventions. You might argue about the morality, but it is not a war crime 

Also, Israel is usually saying "but America/the EU does the same/worse with lesser threats" which I have yet to see a coherent argument against.

The non-Hamas Palestinians and their more moderate leaders such as Fatah/PA are caught in the middle and the ones who deserve our sympathy

Eh, the thing is that Fatah is utterly corrupt and is just out to line their own pockets. The civilian population which does not take part in hostilities or riots is in a much worse position. 




 Then don't blame the opposing force of a massacre and genocide when your civilians die along with the freedom fighters. Usually a resistance is trying to minimize their own civilian casualties, not make more die.
 




 Then don't blame the opposing force of a massacre and genocide when your civilians die along with the freedom fighters.
 




 Yes, it is.

It can be concluded that the use of human shields requires an intentional co-location of military objectives and civilians or persons hors de combat with the specific intent of trying to prevent the targeting of those military objectives.

http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_cha_chapter32_rule97 




 Then don't blame the opposing force of a massacre and genocide when your civilians die along with the freedom fighters. 




 Ok, Israel lifts the blockade on Gaza and two months later there are 20 rockets every day, and several suicide bombers have gone off in towns neighboring Gaza. Now what? 




 What's your point? 




 And all the reports of them doing otherwise this time are hogwash? And that still doesn't address the fact that setting a military installation near civilians is also using human shields. 




 That is what they are doing, as per this article. My personal opinions are beside the point, I would just like to know if he would be using human shields like Hamas does. 




 If you were in Gaza now, would you hide behind ~~a mound~~ an apartment building, pick up a ~~gun~~ rocket launcher and take pot shots at Israeli ~~soldiers~~ civilians?

FTFY. 




 1. They're in danger as long as they're in Gaza, not because the firing has stopped. 

2. Other journalists are still in danger if they are caught doing similar things.

3. Hamas might take action against the news company still in Gaza or in later reporting, even if that specific journalist doesn't return. 




 Nope.

 [Look at how many bases are not embedded in cities among civilians!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Israel_Defense_Forces_bases) 




 What would a proportionate response be, then? 




 No one sane in international politics thought it was a false flag operation; the two suspects were known members of Hamas and went missing since the day of the kidnapping. A week or so into the search, Israeli intelligence said that the suspects probably acted at their own initiative without a direct order, but that Hamas leadership did encourage their operatives to carry out more kidnappings.

Did Netanyahu use it as an excuse it to round up Hamas members in the West Bank? Absolutely, but that doesn't make it a false flag.

Hamas, if it knew that one of its leaders in the west bank was arrested, might have refused the ceasefire that Israel wanted now that the tunnels are destroyed. Israel revealed it today, after 12 hours or so of the ceasefire being in effect, because they did not think Hamas would take action now that the whole world would blame them for further escalation.  




 Israel bombing a rocket launcher near a home makes the fact that civilians died, though tragic, not a war crime unless casualties are disproportionate to the military gain 

edit: for the specific military strike, not the whole operation/war. 




 [The reaction to Israel using soldiers instead of airstrikes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2b8bd7/at_least_100_palestinians_from_a_single/) 




 A 1:1 civilian to militant casualty rate is the best in modern warfare. 




 By this logic, you are encouraging Hamas to continue these tactics since they know Israel won't fire back. In this case, what should Israel do instead? Because no population will allow its government to sit and do nothing while rockets are being shot at it. 




 Ok, that's step 3. There are three different levels here:

1. When is killing justified? Answer: War, self-defence, and execution.

2. What are valid reasons for executions?

3. What are valid methods for executions?

You have to agree to the first before we go to the other two. 

This is debate is about specifically the commandment from god to not kill, and the commandment from god to kill.

And my original comment was saying that **there is no commandment from God to not kill.** the verse says do not murder. You can argue about whether it is humane or capricious, but it is not a contradiction. Saying so only hurts your argument. 




 And this is why the Israeli censor is sometimes important. If this had come out three weeks ago instead of after the ceasefire, Hamas might have taken more drastic action. 




 They're still in danger, unfortunately. 














 You're arguing that killing during war, self-defense, and execution is morally acceptable, because god ordered it.

No, I'm arguing that these are the acceptable situations in which killing is permissible the world over and always have been. The argument over whether these laws should carry the death penalty (and why) is the second argument, but the other one has to come first. So do you accept the death penalty and other forms of killing are permissible (if not ideal), at least for this argument? 




 [But it is in line with the reporting of past conflicts.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_War_\(2008%E2%80%9309\)#Casualties) 




 No, it just means that Israel is better at protecting it's civilians. I would not want to see the number killed with no sirens, bomb shelters, or Iron Dome. 




 Are we arguing the death penalty now? Because that is a different subject entirely. We can do so if you want, but it's not the same argument as you had above. 




 It is an execution if the person is brought before a court of law and tried according to [procedures outlined here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_and_corporal_punishment_in_Judaism). Otherwise, it is murder. That's why the story of Jesus stopping a stoning is so nonsensical.  




 Ground invasions actually have worse civilian casualty rates than air strikes do, since artillery shelling shelling is much less accurate. What if that strike team was surrounded? Shells would fall on that entire neighborhood, killing dozens. Would you condemn Israel for that too?

And that justification is much, much better than the the justification for Hiroshima and Nagasaki: We won't be able to conquer Japan because there would be no support for mass troop deaths, so lets bomb the fucking civilians and kill thousands instead of attacking soldiers.  




 Ratzach = Murder

Harrag = kill

Executions, war, and self-defense are killing, not murder. It's the same thing today. 




 I don't care about the points, but about the post being visible. I don't complain if it's above 0. 




 Journalism before video was a thing, you know. There are still these thing called "written articles" which /r/worldnews sometimes links to. Amazing, right? 




 God never says not to kill, but not to murder. If you're going to argue this, do it correctly. 




 And this is how polytheism started! :P 




 Innocent civilians will be killed and the world will be up in arms not matter what, so let's not risk soldiers if we don't have to. 




 Allow them to take it and report on it once you leave.  




 No, the bible is infallible because words are used consistently. In this example, "face to face" is always an idiom for "directly," while "see My face" is compared to "see My back." I don't need to deal with the NT. 




 Yes, the work they do is dangerous, but they should say that Hamas is intimidating them. 




 Then they should say so instead of meekly parroting Hamas' talking points. 




 So they dutifully parrot Hamas' talking points instead. Not doing so isn't Pulitzer worthy, in normal circumstances. 

If they're scared, they should say so instead of covering it up. 




 It really shouldn't be. They were just at the right place at the right time. There should be many more of these types of reports coming out of Gaza.

Edit: really guys, downvotes? I'm not saying they need to have the balls to film it while their in Gaza, but they should at least report on it once they leave. If they are staying silent outside of Gaza for "access," then they are acquiescing to this war crime.

 I'm not in DebateReligion, so I'll make this quick. "Three persons, on God" is polytheism *according to Judaism*. The range of permissibility is from "complete idolatry" to "acceptable for non-Jews."

 The same reason that as an American (or a citizen of any country), you have rights and responsibilities that others, immigrants or tourists, do not have. If David's mother is American and he is born in another country, he gets citizenship as soon as he visits the nearest consulate. You are Jewish the same way, it's just more automatic and cannot be revoked.   




 Everyone has to go through a period of atonement/spiritual cleansing. Non-practicing Jews just might have a little bit more to go through. 




  What is the purpose of saying he must technically keep the commandment if his actual obligation is waved?

How it is treated in Jewish law. Suffice to say that until he learns about it, it doesn't matter.

Humans are humans and if you WANT to be in this covenant, that's one thing. But, from my POV, it's completely unfair and unjust that my friend Daniel is given expectations because of his blood.

His blood and mine are NOT significantly different. Of course there is a difference, but the difference is not significant. Making it significant is a fabrication. A method of keeping clan-unity in the ancient world. We should, as species, move past this obsession with blood-line. It's unhealthy. It's unfair. It's unreasonable.

This is ancestry, not "blood." The blood is pretty much the same all around. 

It comes down to a different system of values. Post-Enlightenment western values places a lot of emphasis on individuality, while traditional Judaism has more of a balance between community responsibility and individual desires. As an atheist, I assume you support the idea of moral relativism, of which this is a manifestation. 




 All I'm saying is it's ignorant to think that we can say with absolute certainty that the Big Bang is fact, same with evolution.

That is the Orthodox definition, yes.

Why would I follow this rule if I believe that not worshiping an idol would be bad for me? Also wouldn't Trinitarian and Latter Day Saint Christianity count as idolatry?

It is forbidden for Jews to practice it, but it is probably allowed for everyone else.

Would saying "I think the god of the Tanakh, New Testament, Qur'an and Book of Mormon is not worthy of worship" count?

Debatable, but probably not.

I don't eat anything with meat as the primary indigent but I do eat stuff with meat as a secondary indigent. I don't think eating an animal while alive will be a big deal to me. Also it is unsanitary.

Eating meat, in general is allowed. But with the cruel conditions many animals are raised today, there are actually arguments to say that this is being violated. Also things like shark fins which were torn from the animal before it dies.

What does this exactly mean? And what law?

A system of justice that society chooses for itself. 




 There is no eternal hell in Judaism, and no one is cast into "damnation."  




 Calm down. The situation you're describing is, in Jewish law, equivalent to someone who is taken captive. He is still technically has the obligation to keep the commandments, but he is not liable for any of them since he doesn't know about it. 

I'm sorry, but BONDAGE that is inherited by children and their children and their children is UNFAIR. My friend Daniel is a free agent and he decides who or what he forms a pact with.

This is a different discussion entirely. 




 And the residents of the south will continue to suffer in the meantime. It's time to end this now -- it's the best chance that we're going to get. 




 But giving in to demands without anything in return is even worse, since it further legitimizes Hamas among the Gazan population. 




 A forced cessation of hostility because they ran out of rockets is much better in the long run. This ceasefire only allows them to restock...again. 




 A ceasefire? Now? I would have been a favor of one 10 days ago. But now Hamas has few rockets left, the majority of people near Gaza have already left, and the international community's attention has turned away. Now is the time to continue until they run out of rockets and force them to demilitarize, not to **reward** Hamas for shooting rockets.

  Micah 5:2 But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times. 700 B.C.

This is not a prophecy that the Messiah will be born in Bethlehem, but will come from the clan of Ephrat near Bethlehem - i.e. the line of King David.  




  Matthew did not "make up" whatever ancient writing he was referencing to say this.

Matthew either made it up or referenced something of which we have absolutely no record today. Considering that the Jewish canon, including the prophets, was already codified at the time, I think the former is more likely.

 To add to your analysis, Israeli news is reporting that Hamas has around 25% of its rockets left, but only a few of which can reach beyond the area right near Gaza. 




 His dissent is pretty much in line with every major news source out there. 




 What is your answer? Currently it's "Iron Dome doesn't work!" Then why are there no injuries? 




 I am looking for a reason you can give as to why there are no injuries or damage in Tel Aviv. So far you have failed to provide one.
 




 ok my bad. Israelis are the most awesome, most educated, most aware people in the world. They know everything before it happens.

If you lived in Israel then, you could see that the Patriot system didn't work, which is what people said at the time. If you live in Israel now, you can see that Iron Dome is working. How is this so difficult to get through your thick skull? Why do you believe a bad analysis of grainy images of eyewitnesses you said the true thing both times?
 




  maybe the iron dome is 90% effective...but maybe it's just like with the patriot system and it's all bs.

Again, my parents looked out their window in Tel Aviv, and saw the damage being done by the scud missiles and how the Patriot system was failing. People look out their windows now and see how Iron Dome is succeeding. Are you going to respond to this point? 

The point, that you clearly missed, is that what people THINK they know today, typically turns out to be wrong when they actually look at the details later.

And proposals vs. weapons systems being fired are two totally different things. At least the analogy to the patriot system is actually legitimate even if it shows how Iron Dome is working. A vague "wake up sheeple!" isn't going to convince anyone, you know.
 




 You're right. I was just distinguishing between batteries (of which adding more in the same area would be mostly redundant) and multiple interceptors per battery, which are already used. 




 They are adding more batteries to different areas to ensure complete protection, for example if the north and south are both attacked at once. In 2012 there were 4 or 5 batteries, I think know there are about 10 and more are being added. There is also much more support for the "Iron Beam" proposal which would stop short range mortars. 




 yet the reality we found out after the fact was that is worked less tahn 10% of the time.

And Israelis', who were the ones who were supposedly protected by it, knew during the conflict that it wasn't working. Just like they know now the Iron Dome is working.

you gotta open your mind and ears.

Fine, point me to the best. Your argument currently comes down to "wake up sheeple!" 




 Your argument would hold water if you were talking about not developing it in the first place because of the cost. You're saying this:

yes that's the problem...what people "~~see~~ want" and the reality it's used for are quite often different.

We can see what Iron Dome is doing *right now.*

look at the patriot act - after 9/11 every single person was gung ho for it because it seemed like it's protectingus.

now? it's the most unpatriotic thing and a tool for all of the recent NSA abuses.

And people warned about that when it was passed. This is a weapons system, not a law or planned war. Your analogies are awful. 




  The evidence for this is that only 22 people have died in over 15,000 rocket attacks over a decade.

This is where you analysis absolutely fails. Yes, people have died in roughly the same numbers because of other security measures, **but injuries and damages** are massively down. That is not pure chance.

you are raging so hard you didn't realize the 10% figure is the number of the effectiveness of the Patriot system. The same system that the US claimed is 90% effective...similarly to how Israel claims the Iron Dome is effective.

we won't know til later - like we found out about the patriot system.

Except Israelis knew during the Gulf War that the patriot system wasn't working by looking out their windows, just like they know the opposite now.

 




 That was the argument as to why not develop it in the first place. But the vast majority of the cost was paid in development and now it is working extremely well and people feel much safer, so no. It is actually a kind of celebrity. 




 I would more compare it to stopping a sexual assault, but whatever floats your boat! :P

I'm not here to argue with shitheads online, but to refute them so that other people reading are more informed. Trying to change posters' opinions here is useless. 




 now I understand why the bias and selective processing of information

Now you know why people like Iron Dome so much. It is not statistics released by the IDF, but what people see. 




 Mind if I copy paste this into my analysis above so we have a coordinated rebuttal? 




 I save my downvotes for Hams supporters on worldnews. Why I go there is still a mystery... 




 Israel doesn't have an military-industrial complex like America has, so the comparison to the patriot missile is bullshit. 

I agree. Take a look at the democracynow discussion. Guy makes some incredibly good points.


What are his best points? I can't see any very good ones? 




 This is an edited letter I sent to a news publication earlier to show why the 5% figure is complete bullshit:

I can definitely state that Iron Dome's intercept rate is over 5%. 

**Statistics and Analysis**

First, his analysis is not new and is mainly based on Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012, not the most recent conflict, and was done using civilian photographs. (Weirdly, I can't find the original analysis itself, only reports of it.) It is not clear in yours or other articles whether he is stating that only 5% of total rockets, or 5% of rockets that Iron Dome fires at, are intercepted. A clarification would be nice in that respect, since the IDF only fires the Iron Dome when the missiles are headed to a built up area, since it are so expensive to use.

[Here is Ha'aretz on the 2012 analysis.](http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/how-many-rockets-has-iron-dome-really-intercepted.premium-1.508277
) Two articles([1](http://www.technologyreview.com/news/528916/israeli-rocket-defense-system-is-failing-at-crucial-task-expert-analysts-say/
), [2](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/528991/an-explanation-of-the-evidence-of-weaknesses-in-the-iron-dome-defense-system/
)) in the MIT technology review have been published about this. I believe the article you linked to is based on the second:

[Here are the latest IDF statistics](http://www.idfblog.com/blog/2014/08/05/operation-protective-edge-numbers/
) of rockets fired at Israel (note: as of 8/05):

* 3,360 rockets fired 
* 2,303 hit Israel (70%)
* 475 hit gaza (14%) 
* 584 intercepted by Iron dome (17%)

If the IDF claims an 80% success rate of Iron Dome, that means:

* they fired at about 730 (22% of total rockets)
* and missed 150 (5% of total rockets) 
* Most of the 2000+ rockets that did hit would have hit open areas, but not all.

5% effectiveness related to total rockets would be 150 intercepted, which is 20% attempted interceptions, nothing to sneeze at though still not great. 5% of attempted interceptions would be only about 40 rockets. Which is it?

**Refutation**

Second, His analysis is pretty easy to refute, not by looking at grainy images, but by looking at warnings, damages, and casualties. There have been over 30 sirens in the Tel Aviv area; unlike your article states, most of it is apartment buildings or high rises, not open space. (If you want to see a city with open space, go to Be'ersheva.) As far as I can tell, and I have been following updates closely, there have not been one rocket reported to actually hit the area. How is this possible if Iron Dome only intercepts 5% of the rockets it launches at? The expensive, Iranian made Fajr-5 missiles actually use a targeting system and would be aimed toward civilian populations.

And the places further south (Kiryat Melachi, Ashdod, Ashkelon, etc.) seem to have much less damage than they did in the 2008 war. You're the reporter, not me, so this is something you can research, but my impressions were that it was unsafe to at all live in those areas during that war, and there was a lot of destruction. This year, there have been very few reports of damages, while I remember almost every day I heard about rocket damage in 2008 and 2012. 
During this operation there have been only **3 civilian deaths and 22 injuries** (according to the IDFblog which seems to have stopped updating in mid-July, but I can't imagine that it is more than 50 injuries) while in 2008, according to Wikipedia, **600+ were injured** (4,000 rocket attacks) and in 2012 it was **almost 300** (3,000 rocket attacks). This is another place your analysis and/or the professor's fails; yes, the deaths are about the same, but as he says deaths are unlikely anyway. However, injuries and damages are dramatically down while rockets, and more targeted and damaging rockets, are up. This would make no sense if Iron Dome wasn't working. 

*TL;DR A 10-20 fold decrease in injuries, and massively reduced reports of damages, is absurd if Iron Dome wasn't successful.*

**Feeling of Security**

Furthermore, anyone on the ground can tell you there is a large difference between this war and 2008. There is a different sound if a rocket hits the ground, a rocket explodes on the ground, or an Iron Dome intercepts a rocket. There have been multiple reports of shrapnel falling from destroyed rockets. People feel much safer because they notice my points above. **Iron Dome is not a celebrity in Israel because people see it shooting and the IDF publishes statistics, but because they can see that the destruction from Hamas is severely limited now that it has been deployed all across the south.**

**Conspiracy**

Final point: It would require an incredible conspiracy to cover all of this up (/r/conspiracy levels!). There are lots of people working or have worked on Iron Dome, and they would have to prevent anyone from speaking about its failure. If there has been damages from rockets hitting buildings, like the one that killed 3 in 2012, it would need to be covered up. If there were no rockets fired at the Tel Aviv area, the only other conclusion from my above analysis, then fake Red Alert sirens would have to be ordered and then covered up. None of these are plausible.

Is it possible the IDF is exaggerating somewhat? Possibly. But nothing on the order of a 5% of claimed interceptions or of total rockets. We would be seeing entirely different results on the ground if that was the case.

Edit: Your points are addressed above as well, but to show specifically why you are wrong:

it has more to do with the crude and shitty rockets being used than the Iron Dome.

Then why are damages and injuries down so much if Iron Dome wasn't working?

 Also, the thing that keeps Israelis safest isn't the Iron Dome - it's the incredibly effective and well deployed early warning system that allows people to find cover quickly

Absolutely. But even with this system over 600 people were injured in 2008, and we are seeing nothing on that level today. Statistics of damages are much harder to find, but it seems to be a lot less as well.

Studies have shown that even a 5 second warning, allowing someone to lie/duck down and cover, increases surivability by 60%+ Makes sense if you think about the explosion and trajectory of debris.

**Survivability =/ Injuries.** Yes, they might survive, but could still be moderately or severely injured. Your analysis doesn't explain the discrepancy. 
 




 From what I've read, it's mostly three and four. There are already 3 potential interceptors fired from each battery before the rocket hits the ground, and each interceptor costs $20,000 to fire.

 




 He hasn't been following the news. The 90%+ figure was only at the start of this conflict. 




 So you should support Al-Qaeda and not Hamas! 




 This article was published today and the Jerusalem post is a pretty major news source. 




 Everyone remember this: Hamas first says one thing to the west and then another thing to their supporters. The same will come out about the death count in Gaza once everyone has stopped paying attention; innocent civilians will magically transform into heroic martyrs who fought to the death. 




 Is there any statement in American law which says the purpose of American citizens is to follow those laws? 




 Ok, now I'm just confused what your response has to do with my original comments... 




 Operation Protective Edge is not Operation Brother's Keeper, and both occurred with provocations, not randomly. 




 Yep, just correcting because these kinds of misconceptions can be easily propagated, as the history of christianity shows. 




  The kitzur's issue with flames not being at the same height (and the Ah"S would probably agree) is the latter. 

Except aren't these requirements still valid whether or not a shamash is present? This seems to indicate that the problem addressed is showing that the 8 as one unit but still distinct from one another, not that they are a unit which are separate from the shamash.

 




 Also, KJV, not JKV.

Thanks.

The simple fact that a significant portion of rabbinic texts are written in Aramaic and are, in many cases, considered more authoritative than the original text of the Hebrew Bible itself undercuts the notion that Hebrew was the authoritative language.

Yes, all true. But you said:
the only accepted version of the Qur'an is one that is in Arabic, whereas this is not the case with the Hebrew Bible

scriptural texts written in English...are all just as authoritative as the original languages

This is what I am disputing, not that there are many texts written in other languages in Jewish and halachic literature. You are giving the impression that the **translation** of a Hebrew Bible into English, or a Talmud into the same, is as authoritative as the original text.

 




 Are either of these two things incorrect? Jewish converts to Christianity are not expected to follow the Torah, and from a Jewish viewpoint worshipping Jesus is idolatry.  




 Yes, but it is an addendum and not part of the requirement. It reads like this:

Do not follow a man who leads you astray by telling you to worship other Gods, even if he performs miracles, for God is testing you by sending him. 




 Yes? All 8 candles must be recognizable as being lit together -- but the shamash must be separate so as not to be confused, which I see as the biggest problem here. Neither of your sources here seem to address that. 




 Just so that there is no bad blood between us, I never downvoted you. 




 From what I have learned, it is the commonly held belief in Rabbinic Judaism after the fall of the second Temple. Even among the modern, liberal streams of Judaism translations are much more acceptable but not authoritative, especially compared to how the JKV is treated among many Christian sects. Do you have a source that says otherwise? 




  If that's true provide a reference for it.

Start with [this wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_and_antisemitism). Click on the links on top of the subsections for expanded explanations. This is all burned into the Jewish collective memory.

Reference?

See the link above, specifically the arguments among early church fathers and the Spanish Inquisition. If you want to read more on the latter, google conversos, crypto-Jews, and marranos.
 
Considered them backward? I thought they were tortured and killed? (Really, can you source any of this?)

Augustine is the most commonly given example. Again, read the opinions of early church fathers on Jews and Judaism. 




 Oh, I do that too. I mean that when the problem continues afterwards and they continue to complain without doing anything. 




 three months is "right after" now? Who knew! 




 Of course, I meant that the shamash flame must be different in some way from all of the others. 




  For many Christians and Jews, scriptural texts written in English (or French, or German, or Swahili, what have you) are all just as authoritative as the original languages. 

I do not believe that this is true in Judaism. The original language is always the best, as far as I have seen. 




 Would it be possible to delete the old bigoted posts? 




  Go talk shit about israel

Yeah, this might be the problem. Criticizing and talking shit are two different things. 




  we are held to a higher standard than the believers of the OT

How is not following the law being held to a higher standard? 




  In other words, jews follow the letter of the law and christian follow the spirit of the law.

The spirit of the Law is quite clearly to follow the letter of the law, which christians don't do.
 




 The person would be considered raised as a captive. That means that he would be breaking commandments (which is based on actions, not intentions) but would not be held as liable for what he did. 




 I meant that just because someone in Gaza tweets something expressing sympathy of someone in America does not mean that Hamas doesn't want to kill them. 




  Peter didn't do either of these two things. Or if he did, she me where (again, chapter and verse). 

1. The Church, which is based on Peter's teachings, told Jews to not follow the Law.

2. Peter and the Church both told Jews to follow other gods (Jesus). 

Fits pretty well.
 




 For very good reasons. 




 such as, that there were foods that "defiled a man", in the sense that they, of themselves, had the power of making someone unclean.

Why do you think that Jews ever taught this?

 I said above that Peter never instructed any Torah observant Jews to disobey one iota of Torah. Nor did I suggest anywhere that Jesus told any of his Jewish followers to disregard Torah.

Except it is your church that has multiple times, over the past 2000 years, given Jews living in its lands two options: convert or die. And if converted, they could not keep the old laws under pain of torture and death. Even when they were suffered to live, the Church considered them backwards for keeping the Law that God enjoined upon them, and celebrated converts from Judaism (who, incidentally, were not required to keep the Law).

 




  Jews were used to seeing Gentiles as "unclean", like dogs

Why do you think this is true?

These cleanliness laws, as well as circumcision, built up a "wall of separation" between Israel and "the Nations".

Why did God make a law, which he called eternal, only to tear it down a few years later?
 




 *Christianity* doesn't make sense. Don't tar all religions with the same brush, though. 




 Correction: A false prophet is someone who causes people to transgress by claiming that he is receiving a divine message. Performing miracles is not part of the criteria. The Torah just says that miracles should be irrelevant to the message. 




 There are only two things God created that can be classified as evil: death and free will. Just because God created them doesn't mean he cannot be good. 




 I guess hit on = attempted rape now... 




 From what I learned in high school, the most important thing (edit: in this case) is that the Shamash is distinct. Both could work if you place a visibly different candle in the shamash holder, I think. 




 Then can you also explain why women *do* it? "Venting" without wanting a solution, ever. Sympathy without a solution, like the person above said. 




 Send a few "summary" paragraphs and ask him out on a date. Otherwise it's a little bit too much in the beginning. Use the rest to guide how you would like to express your feelings in person. 




 Could you list/link to all the army ranks in Hebrew with the english equivalents?  




 You mean the one that the US took over through an aggressive war less than 200 years ago? Mexico has a right to that land!  




 They'll be faulted regardless of what they do. 




 Hamas =/ individual Palestinians 




 Many of the alleged conspirators are Hamas members who were released as part of the Shalit deal and then rearrested. These are the same people that Hamas is demanding be set free as part of the ceasefire negotiations.

I wonder how this will change the Hamas-PA unity pact which has still been technically in effect throughout this war? 









 From a previous point of mine about why Isaiah 53 is clearly about Israel:

Isaiah 53 is very clearly talking about the Children of Israel, though it is obscured by the way Christians separated the chapters. If you look at 52: 13-15 (which is the same section that starts with chapter 50), you can see that the prophet introduces a "servant" in third person. 13 says that the servant will be exalted, 14 that (in past tense) "marred beyond man is his appearance," 15 that (in future tense) how kings and nations will react.

Then, in 53:1, the narrative shifts to the perspective of those kings and nations, who are talking about the servant after he has risen and exalted. In the past, "he had not form," "he was despised," etc. But now "He has grown," "he might see offspring," etc. Then in the second half of verse 11 the narrative shift back to prophet, who describes the servant a bit more.

Now how is it possible that, during the time the prophet was speaking, Jesus was already marred, and that nations were appalled (did this ever happen?). Only in the future will the nations say "As one who hid his face from us, he was despised, we held him to no account." Did they ever say this about Jesus? On the other hand, (the house of) Israel fulfills all of this! In context with chapters 52 and 54, if one is a believer, one could see the prophecy be fulfilled today. If you read the entire section, chapter 53 is actually the pivot between a mourning Israel/Jerusalem and a joyous one, it makes sense why Israel would be referred as a "suffering servant" here. 




 Me? No. Do some commentators? Yes. 




 Judaism's view: It's a debate whether it was slight of hand or actual magic.  




 Do you want me to go through these and show that each and every one is, to quote from above, "not a prophecy at all, not a messianic prophecy, or taken so far out of context that it's purported to mean the opposite of what it actually means?" 




 How is this the letter of the law? Sabbath mode just disables the electronic displays and auto turn off. It's the exact same thing as having a constant fire going. 




 It'd be like saying that we can worship other Gods now

Funny thing us, that is what was done with Jesus and all afterwards. 




 What's interesting is that the symptoms described by galphanore are very similar to the real ones after fasting/long term malnourishment. But the latter are a lot more...insidious, I guess? 




 It's too goddamn long and not much happens. 
























 You have a lot of Jesus says in that paragraph. If Jesus is preaching a trinitarian god, different from the unitary one previously revealed, why should we believe him? 




 I have answers, I'll type them up when off mobile.

Edit: Ok, let's break this down. I'm not going to address whether this Psalm is messianic or not, but the claim that the Messiah is also God. First, a readable text:

2              

3          

4     

5         

6        

7        

8            

9       

10        

The first five verses are saying the king (or the hero of the king perhaps) is strong, righteous and blessed by God, and so will defeat the kingdom's enemies. Simple enough, and it could be referring to the Messiah if you look at it the right way. Then, right after the enemies are defeated:

7        

There are a few different translations that could work here for the first half of the verse.

You throne, God, is established for eternity,

OR

Your heavenly/divine/majestical (lit: of God) throne is established for eternity,

The translation clearly goes by the second. The verse, like many in Hebrew poetry, has two halves which parallel one another. The second half says "your scepter of kingship is a scepter of fairness." Both describe an object that has two properties. The first has a godly and everlasting throne, the second has a scepter that symbolizes kingship and fairness. The parallel breaks down if you say that  addresses God. It is an adjective, not a noun. Note that the Christian English translation writes it that the verses are broken up differently to obscure this.

8            

You have loved justice and hated wickedness, therefore, God--your God--has anointed you with oil of mirth beyond that of your friends" (friends could also be kinsmen).

The confusion comes from how the verse is punctuated; , your God, is actually a descriptor of , God. **The person addressed is not named in this or in any other verses of the psalm.** Why can't the verse be read like you translated above? Because the noun following the verb must be the subject, not the object, of the sentence. In addition, the object is already a part of the verb. Literally, it reads:

Anointedyou, God yourGod, oil...

The lack of spaces is deliberate in order to demonstrate how the grammar is written. The verb/object is the first word, and the subject-adjective are the second and third words. There is only one direct object contained in that phrase, not two.

Therefore, the person being addressed (perhaps the Messiah) has been (figuratively) anointed by God and given a godly throne. The next two verses describes his other blessings that he receives after conquering. There is no double God hinted at here.

P.S. Yes,  can also mean judge, FYI, like in Deutoronomy 17. 




 **That's the problem.** why should we change to a thread text which throws away the old when the latter tells us this is the exact situation we should avoid? 




 OK, under that criteria bar-kochva is the messiah, and he'll finish when he comes back any day now. He certainly got further than Jesus did. Why do you think he's not the Messiah and Jesus is? 




 And I'm not entirely sure how I got into this conversation in the first place :/

You posted in a thread about OT prophecies, so I'm not sure what you were expecting! :P and I know nothing about the epistles, so it's OK.

Can you explain to me the difference?  

Sure. Since annointing someone was standard practice when they were raised to a position of authority, (king, priest, etc.). So these are all "anointed ones" or messiahs. The term The Messiah, the one who would lead Israel to redemption, came from the fact that the Jews had no self governing leaders for a long time, and thus no anointed ones. So it came to mean "the one who will be anointed" when the Jews are free.

I'll get to the rest when I'm off mobile. 




 Look at this thread on /r/debatereligion to see that logic in action. 




 In my mind, the definitive way to tell if Jesus was the Jewish Messiah would be to compile a list of all the Messianic prophecies and compare them to Jesus' life as documented in both the New Testament and in secular sources and see if he fulfilled every single one of them.

Luckily for you, this has been done before. Jesus did not fulfill the most obvious prophecies. /r/Judaism/wiki/jesus

Edit: Oh God, that site is awful. I'll take the time to debunk it if you respond here. 




 The trinity is not found in the Bible. They are one in purpose, but not in being.

Oh right, you're Mormon. Well, that's even worse, honestly. "You shall have no other gods before me."

[Citation Needed]


/r/Judaism/wiki/Jesus

 




 I believe that that verse is one of the songs of the suffering servant, is that not correct? 

That's right.

Is there anything about the Messiah that claims he is not a servant of the Lord? Messiah, after all, just means "anointed one".

First, there are two different meanings of messiah -- an anointed one, used a lot in the historical parts of the Bible, and **the** Messiah, which is used is some of the prophets. I've found that Christians often confuse the two.

Second, of course the Messiah will be a servant of God. That doesn't mean that this prophecy is about the Messiah, like it is claimed. :P Why do you think is specifically about the Messiah as opposed to anyone else?

I think this is talking about the children of Israel, not the Messiah. A previous write up of mine:

 Isaiah 53 is very clearly talking about the Children of Israel, though it is obscured by the way Christians separated the chapters. If you look at 52: 13-15 (which is the same section that starts with chapter 50), you can see that the prophet introduces a "servant" in third person. 13 says that the servant will be exalted, 14 that (in past tense) "marred beyond man is his appearance," 15 that (in future tense) how kings and nations will react.

 Then, in 53:1, the narrative shifts to the perspective of those kings and nations, who are talking about the servant after he has risen and exalted. In the past, "he had not form," "he was despised," etc. But now "He has grown," "he might see offspring," etc. Then in the second half of verse 11 the narrative shift back to prophet, who describes the servant a bit more.

 Now how is it possible that, during the time the prophet was speaking, Jesus was already marred, and that nations were appalled (did this ever happen?). Only in the future will the nations say "As one who hid his face from us, he was despised, we held him to no account." Did they ever say this about Jesus? On the other hand, (the house of) Israel fulfills all of this! In context with chapters 52 and 54, if one is a believer, one could see the prophecy be fulfilled today. If you read the entire section, chapter 53 is actually the pivot between a mourning Israel/Jerusalem and a joyous one, it makes sense why Israel would be referred as a "suffering servant" here.
 
 









  Jesus was, after all, an unlearned Jew

Wait, I thought it was claimed he was a rabbi?

I don't find the argument that they're pulling things out of context to pull the wool over those unfamiliar with the prophecies convincing.

I wouldn't find it convincing either, except for the preponderance of evidence. I don't see any other way there are so many seemingly deliberate mistakes.

looking at the context of those verses and finding it ambiguous whether or not it is referring to the messiah. 

Do you want to discuss one or more you find particularly strong or noteworthy? It's why I made the rebuttal in the first place.
 




 It's only talked about when Israel is killing them. It's ignored otherwise. 




 [Here's one](http://christianity.about.com/od/biblefactsandlists/a/Prophecies-Jesus.htm) that's been linked to three times on this forum that I've seen. [Here's](http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/messianicprophecies.html) a second I've seen once. I've refuted them but have yet to see someone respond to my comment.

First debunking:

  

 I'm not going to debunk each prophecy, but group into different categories. We can discuss them further from there. Note: I will not be looking at Psalms, as it is poetry and not prophetic. You can try to prove that psalms in general is prophetic/if a specific verse is about the Messiah, if you want.
 
 Correct: 6, 7, 8, 16,
 
 Any Jew, only prophetic in a general sense: 4, 5, 6,
 
 About the Messiah but Misinterpreted: 2, 18
 
 Psalms: 9, 14, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 30, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 41, 42, 43 (most, if not all, are not about the Messiah and are taken out of context. I will be willing to review each one once you prove Psalms can be prophetic.)
 
 Not about the Messiah: 1, 3/10, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21, 23*, 25/26, 28, 29, 31, 33, 35, 36, 39, 40, 44.
 
 To break the last category down for further discussion:
 
 Torah: 1, 15, 36
 
 Isaiah 53: 14, 28, 31, 40, 44
 
 Other Isaiah: 3/10, 13, 18-21, 29
 
 Other Prophets: 9, 11, 12, 16, 23, 25/26, 33, 39

Second dubunking:

 Correct: 7/8 (see disputations about genealogy),
 
 Any Jew, only prophetic in a general sense: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
 
 About the Messiah but Misinterpreted: 13, 14
 
 Psalms: 12, 14, 17, 18, 22, 23/24, 25/26, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45
 
 Not about the Messiah: 9, 10, 11, 14, 18 (all Isaiah sources), 20, 21, 25/26/27/28, 29/31/40, 30, 32/33,
 
 About the Messianic age, not the Messiah: 14, 15, 16, 19
 
 Not a prophecy: 1, 35, 36

 




 What is Russia? I would have to learn the history of that country and region. Then the concepts of socialism and communism to understand the rise of the ussr and its leaders. Then how Russia got control of those countries behind the "Iron curtain." This would take me 2-3 hours at least, even granting that I already knew the terms contained within those articles.

I could go on, but you see how much background knowledge (memorization) you need just to read one sentence about the Cold War, let alone why it began. 




 I think it's pretty clear that it does not mean the city when looked at in the broader context.

My thought is that since Jesus didn't fulfill the messianic prophecies, the Gospel writers had to make up plausible sounding ones to convince people that he was actually the messiah. This, among lots of others, fit, so they took it out of context and (mis)used it. I've seen at least two lists of these "prophecies" recently, and the vast majority of the items are incorrect. 




 All of this requires concepts you only know through memorization. From a perspective of someone who knows the language but never encountered these terms before:

Was it the Soviets (who are they?), who reneged on their agreements (what were these agreements?) to allow the people of Eastern Europe (where is this in comparison to soviet? how many people are there? what is the culture?) to determine their own fates (were they kept locked in dungeons? what was their fate?) by imposing totalitarian rule (what kind of rule is this?) on territories unlucky enough to fall behind the "Iron Curtain?" (did the soviets hang a curtain around eastern europe?)
 




 Jesus never called His disciples to follow other gods. All of His ministry pointed towards the father.

The trinity is a "god not known", for God revealed himself as a perfect unity, which Jesus then changed to a trinity.

The Jews were also expecting a miraculous Savior to rise to the throne and free them from the Romans.

uh, yes, because that is what the prophecies say will happen. Jesus didn't do that. 




 What do you mean?  




 No, it says that the Messiah will be born of Bethlehem-Ephratah, the area where David was from. It is just another way of saying david's lineage. 




 What do you think the civilian casualty rate will be in the latest bombing campaign? 50%? 80%? And will it be by the American standard of any male between 16-40 is a combatant?

More importantly, will anyone talk about it when Israel isn't killing them? 




 Poe's law in action... 




 You might benefit from the use of E-Prime.

Yeah, sometimes that happens when I write quickly...

the only possible interpretation, and anybody who sees it differently is just crazy

...but I don't think I said this. On the other hand, I do believe I have the correct interpretation, and since this is a debate forum I state my opinion strongly and expect a strong rebuttal. 




 lol, ok 




 He never said that, just that these elements are present in Judaism. Which is true.

But they aren't used to coerce people to do anything, so it doesn't bear resemblance to the threat of hell and heaven in Christianity. 

Judaism includes Satan. Whether or not that is the "main point" of Satan in Judaism is subjective, and as a believing Jew, you'll prefer strongly an interpretation which favors Judaism.

You're still not getting it. It's not that satan isn't a main part -- it's that there is no "trickster to explain contrary evidence." The accuser does not have that role. Read the end of Job -- the point is that everything comes from God.

What religion, you mean. Certainly many do. But what is relevant for the purposes of this discussion is that Judaism includes this element.

I said group on purpose. I'm pointing out this element doesn't matter because nearly all groups, not just religions, have included this principle.


The way Jewish children are taught

I'm still not getting it. What is this "way"?

 I am not convinced it was designed to spread virally in as cynical and overt a way as Christianity was

That's because Judaism was never intended for that. Judaism is for the Jews -- or rather, Judaism is the religion for tribe of the children of Jacob, of which Judah was a remnant. It does not look to expand to other people; though it claims to have a supreme God, it also teaches that God made a special covenant for the Jewish people that only applies to them.

 




 Are not things written by prophets to be considered prophetic?

No. Take the absurd example: a prophet's tax bill is not a prophecy, yet he still wrote it. Not *all* things written by a prophet are prophetic.

I showed that some Jews did consider them to be so. 

No, you showed a Messianic splinter sect considered them to be so, relating the Psalms to themselves. Interestingly, "a Messianic splinter sect" is exactly what Christianity was at the time, so I was noting that they both used the same technique of taking random verses and applying them to the present day.

Why quote any of the psalms, then, if no Jews thought that they were prophetic?

As I said above, because it's a common Messianic tactic. See how easy it was to make you believe that because it is holy it is also a prophecy if you read it the right way?

I'm not quite sure what you mean. I have been citing websites as I go--perhaps you just missed those links.

Your original pesher link. It would be nice to get a link which has sources, or even better, a scholarly paper. After that, we can talk about the actual meaning of pesher.
 




 Hey, you asked, I answered.
 




 If you contact the Rabbi or another person in the leadership before the holiday, they will probably give you one. 




 At the time of Jesus' life, some of the Psalms are considered to be prophetic, because some of them are written by David.

You have not demonstrated that this is *because* they were written by David. In addition, you have only quoted one splinter sect of Judaism, who happened to be messianic as well (like Christianity). These types of groups in general like to take unrelated writings and interpret them in light of the present day. Can you demonstrate anyone mainstream thought of Psalms as prophetic?

Also, please quote a website with actual links. That could be made up as far as we know, but I'm reserving judgement for now. 




  He always went on and on about how Jesus fulfilled all the prophecies

Also not true, fyi. There have been debates here before, and it usually comes down to "Jesus will fulfill all of them in the second coming." 




 Rav Kook and his followers, at the very least, are pretty famous. 




 It's the list again! I choose you, copypaste!

I'm not going to debunk each prophecy, but group into different categories. We can discuss them further from there. Note: I will not be looking at Psalms, as it is poetry and not prophetic. You can try to prove that psalms in general is prophetic/if a specific verse is about the Messiah, if you want.

Correct: 6, 7, 8, 16,

Any Jew, only prophetic in a general sense: 4, 5, 6,

About the Messiah but Misinterpreted: 2, 18

Psalms: 9, 14, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 30, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 41, 42, 43 (most, if not all, are not about the Messiah and are taken out of context. I will be willing to review each one once you prove Psalms can be prophetic.)

Not about the Messiah: 1, 3/10, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21, 23*, 25/26, 28, 29, 31, 33, 35, 36, 39, 40, 44.

To break the last category down for further discussion:

Torah: 1, 15, 36

Isaiah 53: 14, 28, 31, 40, 44

Other Isaiah: 3/10, 13, 18-21, 29

Other Prophets: 9, 11, 12, 16, 23, 25/26, 33, 39
 




 4 .- Unverifiable reward if you act in a certain way.

5 .- And/or unverifiable punishment if you do not act in a certain way.

Neither of these points are relevant. Reward/punishment in the afterlife is not the main motivator to do miztvot.

6 .- Invisible trickster to explain away contrary evidence.

Doesn't exist as explained above.

3a .- Promote marriage between believers, within the faith, and have large family.

What group does NOT do this?

3b .- Indoctrination.

Want to explain what you mean? Judaism traditionally teaches a lot of critical thinking. Why do you think so many Jews become lawyers?
 




 What does this have to do with the Messiah? (Your translation is also awful, but we can get to that later.) 




 The same reason you don't analyze homer and at the same time discuss whether it actually happened. Every discussion needs to have axioms, or it goes nowhere. If you want to discuss the veracity of the text, make your own topic. 




 Nope. Being the messiah has nothing directly to do with God. 




 And Jesus didn't exist either, but we're discussing everything as if they're recorded accurately. We don't have to turn every discussion into a debate on the authenticity of the text.  




 A little bit. But they are generally well received or ignored, and they don't press if you refuse. 




 This is not converting, it's more like bringing lapsed Catholics back into the church. 




  Disclaimer: I'm not a Jew, so I might have misinterpreted my Jewish friends' answers to this question.

Nope, this is good. 

 




 I'll break it down point by point.

isn't Israel a specifically Jewish state,

Yes, much in the same way England is Anglican.

But aren't Zionists mostly European immigrants

I don't know what you mean by Zionists here; if you mean Jewish Israelis, it's about evenly split between Ashkenazim and Sefardim/Mizrachim, although the distinction is slowly disappearing.

isn't Zionism not much older than 100 years old?

Zionism, the ideology that Jews should create a state of their own to escape persecution is about 150 years old now, yes. The Jewish longing to return to the "land of Israel" is 2000 years old.

 So up until just over a hundred years ago, waiting for the coming of the messiah before founding a state was something specifically about being Jewish, right?

Yes and no. Before the Enlightenment, there wasn't a concept of "setting up a state." A king ruled a territory, and the Messiah would be a new king who re-established the Kingdom of Israel. There is a thought (it's only one opinion) that Jews should not attempt to self-govern until we are worthy, which will be when the Messiah comes. But there is a tension here: how would you recognize the Messiah if you refuse to attempt to gather in from exile?

It all just seems paradoxical because Zionists seem like reformists

Do you mean Reform, as in Reform Judaism? No, most of the early Zionists were secular, not reform, though there was a significant religious minority involved in the early zionist movement. Most of the Reform movement actually criticized Zionism quite a bit before WWII, since their ideologies were so strongly opposed to one another.

and if we create a Jewish state, it seems like the reformists should have less of a say than the orthodox

They did. Israel is a mostly secular Jewish state, just like England.

but the orthodox don't want the state

No longer true. Many Haredim in Israel are disapproving of the state and try and undermine it, but many others support it. There are many other "Modern Orthodox"/Daati Leumi who are very much Zionists. Both of these groups vote and therefore get a say in running of the state in proportion to their vote.

so we shouldn't listen to them on religious grounds, but its a specifically Jewish state.

These two points have nothing to do with each other.

 Its not like Protestants have much of a say on what happens in the Vatican, but even if they did the Catholics should have first say

Bad analogy. These are two different religious groups, not a religious and a secular group.

I mean if an Orthodox Jewish state is contradictory to the original tenants of Judaism, 

It's not in any way contradictory. There is one opinion saying that Jews shouldn't attempt to return on their own, and I already discussed the tension inherent in it.

then is it still a Jewish state, or just a state obsessed with ethnic purity?

Why do you think Israel is obsessed with ethnic purity more than any other country. About 20% of the population is not Jewish. In addition, Israel is still a Jewish (or more accurately, Israelite) state even if it has no religious laws, just like England is an ethnically English state.

...Unless its just an ethnically Jewish state, in which case wouldn't all orthodox Jews outside of Israel become defacto diaspora?

It is an ethnically Jewish state. And yes, all orthodox Jews consider themselves in the diaspora, but that has nothing to do with the state. 




 None of your points here are accurate. 




 Judaism was founded at the exodus and revelation, not by Abraham. He was apparently a great person who brought a lot of good to the world, including monotheism, but Judaism came later. Nor did he or does he fill a savior role (a concept which doesn't really exist in judasim).

Judaism is not, and never has been, a monastic religion. Abraham was famously wealthy, and the Israelites took lots of gold out of Egypt. 

Judaism is a communal religion which doesn't work without family.

There are no rewards for believing or disbelieving, only doing.

There is no trickster. The satan, or accuser, is best likened as a malicious prosecuter in court.

There is no apocalyptic event, only a redemption. 




 This does not apply at all to Judaism.  




 Huh? The whole state of Judaism is waiting for their Messiah to return Israel to its glory.

Not true.

they rejected Jesus because the Messiah came to save the whole world, not just the Jews.

Also not true. 

From below: 

Who are "they"? The Jews prophesied about a Messiah. Read Isaiah especially. He prophesied of a coming Messiah who would be rejected by his own people.

Three strikes, and yoooooou're out!

Is it? Christianity started in Judea and was brought to Rome. And Asia. And Africa. All within the first century. 

Not very impressive, considering you could travel for 5 days and reach any of these continents.

It is not based on the wisdom of a Roman emperor; it is based on the life and teachings of a middle-eastern Jewish rabbi who claimed to be the son of God, and Christ came for everyone, not just Western society.

No, it was based on Paul and early Catholic church, which was established in (guess where?) Rome! 




 I think they're one seat lower than Yesh atid now. 




 Do you want to have a discussion about your points? 




 Yes, it exists, though most people when trying to use it ask improperly. It is usually not formal though. For example, we had to get a passing non-Jew to turn off the oven. 




 Why not? 




 Because those rockets were fired, dimwit. Read the godam article. The false alarm was this morning, which hasn't been reported anywhere.
 




 Wrong verse. [Numbers 23:19] 




 Not a ger myself, but it is probably because it happens so often outside of deep/personal conversations. I can see how it gets annoying, and somewhat implies that you don't belong. 




 Aaaand you don't know about Judaism, apparently. Stop projecting your experience with Christianity or Islam onto all other religions. 




 Aaaand you don't know about Judaism, apparently. Stop projecting your experience with Christianity or Islam onto all other religions. 




 But of course, when we calmly and positively talk about having sex with a three year old

That you say this means you are completely misunderstanding the entire section. This is a legal discussion, not a code of conduct. 




 No, these were people and their descendants who were there in 1920-1950, and had been living there for hundreds of years. Does the same principle apply? 




 The right of return isn't about returning to a country, it's about returning to what is rightfully your home.

If you acquiesce to thousands of Haredi Jews returning under this definition to Hebron and Jerusalem, as well as all the Mizrachi Jews and their descendents to their homes in the Arab world, I might start taking you seriously. Until then... 




 Oh, I think it's an awful practice that should be stopped, outside of a few people who the community itself should support as well. I probably would have voted for Yair Lapid in the last Israeli election, who advocated and passed a measure to slowly change this.

I think that it is justified in that it is not viewed as stealing; if the state will provide for them to engage in studying, they'll take it. Work is not valued in the intrinsic way that it is in much of Western society, and learning Torah is much more important than contributing (or stealing) from the country. 




 Actually, from my limited knowledge, this is not a very common practice in America. Many people do study at yeshiva, yes, but not their entire life. The practice is much more widespread and pronounced in Israel. 




 I've just been recommended Hearthstone by a friend. I'm a previous casual Magic player -- I know the basic rules, mechanics, and strategies, but never bothered building my own deck because it was too much of hassle, so I didn't play very often. 

What should I know going into the Hearthstone? What are the similarities and differences to Magic, and what should I be expecting? A basic overview would be nice! Thank you! :) 




 Once palestine is established, you will have the right of return to Palestine just as Jews have the right to return to Israel. 




 It depends on where you live. Just search Nintendo office (your country) in google.

 Mewtwo has finally decided, as Mew taught him, that violence is not the answer. He was invited to join both Brawl and Sm4sh (which is why the data was in brawl), but declined in order to instead pursue his peaceful, meditative existence on a secluded island. He spends his days catching up with old friends via telepathy and pondering ways to end violence among both humans and Pokemon. Though I loved playing with him in Melee, I hope he can continue to live at peace with himself. :)

 Exactly what they got out of it this time. Sequence of events:

* Hamas kidnaps and kills teenagers
*  Israel cracks down on Hamas members in the West Bank and starts sweeping manhunt
* Hamas uses this as an excuse to start bombarding southern Israeli residents with rockets
* Israel responds with limited airstrikes and proposes a few quiet-for-quiet agreements
* Hamas rejects these, as well as proposed ceasefires, while saying that it is responding to Israeli aggression; Israel begins official military operation
* Palestinians, militants and civilians, die, as well as a few Israeli civilians
* Ground invasion commences, after Hamas attacks from tunnels, with the purpose eliminate those tunnels; 
* Hamas gets the opportunity to kill and kidnap soldiers, and put many more Palestinian civilians at risk during the fighting
* Israeli ground invasion concludes and ground troops withdraw after tunnels destroyed, as Israel declines to commence a full invasion to eliminate Hamas
* Hamas continues firing rockets, and Israel continues attacking by air
* Hamas accepts a ceasefire once they are close to running out of rockets

The potential and real accomplishments of starting a fight with Israel:

* Increased popularity, both at home and abroad, especially vis a vis Fatah
* Increase donations by terror funders (i.e. Qatar) and well meaning countries and individuals
* Dead Israeli civilians and soldiers
* Captured Israeli civilians and soldiers
* Potential for a massacre of Israelis through fighters emerging from tunnels
* Dead Palestinian civilians to show to the world
* Dead Palestinian militants to show as civilians to the world
* Pressure on Israel to ease blockade 
* Increase support for the right wing in Israel

I could go on, if you want more. It's theorized this round of fighting started now to weaken the unity government/Fatah as well as get more money, since civil servants weren't being paid due to lack of funds. 
 




 Can you go into more detail as to why regular electric watches are allowed? 




 To clarify, it is a law not to eat animals not slaughtered properly, which has the side effect of also avoiding animals which die by disease. 




 No. 




 Nonono, you don't understand, I posted that to make people think I'm a real person instead of a paid shill! And you're my sockpuppet that I made to point it out! Get your act together, man! 









 Nope, it's actually pretty much the translation above, though of course a lot of nuance is lost. 




 I'm saying that the translation is wrong. The text is not talking about a spiritual disease which no longer exists, not the medically defined leprosy of today. 




 It would be. But we're not discussing leprosy. 




 Oh, you have every right to think that it's ridiculous. Just know what it is that you're criticizing.  




 Some few kibbutzim are still doing well. 




  Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.

It's a spiritual disease caused by gossip, and it has a spiritual cure.  




 the punishment for breaking any of them is execution.

Not true. 




 http://i.imgur.com/axJmn.gif 




 It's not goddam leprosy! 




 Whether it is or is not, you didn't write the trivial part. 
























 Hiding in tunnels and telling civilians to disregard evacuation orders is facing the enemy directly? Oh Lord.  




 Find me another that says a massive amount of people who happens to be your anscestors witnessed a miraculous event. 




 Yeah, by a group of people we would call Orthodox Jews.

Yes, because no other Judaism existed. Regardless, your claim about Hebrew being a dead language, only used by the clergy, is incorrect. Again, we don't have to talk about past interpretations; look at the verse in Hebrew now.

 A copy of a copy can have no greater than 100% fidelity, and mistakes aggregate and are rare to correct.

Have you looked at the process of copying the Torah? It is extremely accurate.

Still interpretation.

Yes, but other interpretations is not "just as likely to be correct" as mine, because of these rules.

If that hebrew is the same as the hebrew spoken now, why would we have needed interpretation of it 2000 years ago?

Of course it does. What does it mean to not cook a kid in it's mother's milk, and why is it repeated three times in different sections? What does it mean, slaughter an animal as I have instructed you?

But a cheeseburger can be made without even cooking the cheese with the burger, so it clearly isn't prohibited by the Torah itself.

It depends. How do you define cooking?

You don't worship a different God. You don't have a moral standard that allows the killing of innocents. You believe in charity and helping you fellow man. You believe in obeying the laws of the society in which you live. You believe courts are a valid way of resolving disputes. There are religions that disagree on each of these values.

Many Christian sects also agree on all of these, and they are separate. That's what I was pointing to.

Now onto your supposed list of agreement.

All divisions of Jewish faith believes that the messiah has not come.

Not true, and hasn't been in the past. Of course, some would not call messianic chabad Jewish...

They believe that the sabbath should be kept holy, and is on the seventh day of the seven day week: Saturday. 

Reform believes you don't have to, and even celebrated it on Sunday in the 1800's!

There are no differences I am away of between newer Jewish practices and Orthodox practices that are bigger than these differences between Judaism and Christianity:

Yes, but I'm not saying that. Judaism is very much different than Christianity. But some of the major differences between Christian sects are much smaller than between the major Jewish denominations. 




 It's not just that it happened to many people, it's that it happened to many people who happen to be our ancestors.  




 Hebrew was a dead language for many centuries, spoken only by 
clergy

Not true, it was used by everyone for prayer and study, and was also used as a base for derivative languages. It was never dead, unlike Latin. And since it has recently been revived with mostly the same base, it's pretty easy to get a correct translation. I can go over the verse in depth if you want.

As for cheeseburgers: that's your interpretation, don't cook the two together.

No, that is not my interpretation. That is the interpretation of the mishna, which is the recording of rabbi's statements from 100 BCE to 100 CE. This is the only interpretation Judaism has had for at least 2000 years, more if the Pharisitic claims about the Oral Law are accurate, as Orthodoxy holds.

There are other interpretations of what "unclean" means with regards to pork.

Nope, it's pretty concrete. It says don't eat it.

It's all interpretation

But there are rules and bases for the interpretation. 

and these differences are relatively minor in practice compared to other religious differences.

Not true. There are significant practical issues in eating in a non-kosher home, for example. In fact, there are many more practical issues with different interpretations than many Christian sect splits.
 




 Is it no drinking and no eating? 




 It's a moral tale, not a history. 




 No, it is clear it is not about the dead, because then "for the dead" would be written at the end of the verse, not in the middle. 

And if we consider the origin of this command, it serves as a way to distinguish ourselves from Canaanites.

The whole point is that Orthodoxy's view of the laws are they are in effect forever, no matter what the origin is.

Where is it written that a new may not eat a cheeseburger?

"Do not cook a kid in its mother's milk" is interpreted as "do not cook meat and milk together." 




 Leviticus 19:28 




 Yes and no. Just don't use either when you are referring to God, and no one will have a problem. 




 Why a fast if it's a celebration? 




 Writing Jehovah's Witnesses is fine, just don't actually use that name for God. 




 Probably about 50% of Jewish male names have God's name in one way or another. The rest are historical. 




 *shrug* Christianity doesn't make any sense to me either. It's not more well known because there there is no one proselytizing to Christians, and most Christians don't seek out opposing arguments. 




 That's great! Maybe talk to the theology professor beforehand about your concerns? If they're Jewish, they'll probably understand where you're coming from.

Also, if you're interested, join some of the nerdy clubs on campus. They usually have less of the drinking/banging than the rest.

Have you figured out what to do when people try to convert you? 




 For to us a child has been born, to us a son has been given

This part is past tense, not present tense. Why exactly is an issue of context, but right off the bat what you have is incorrect. Also note that they capitalized child and son to make them seem divine, but there is no such indication in the Hebrew.

and authority/power has been on his shoulders

Government here makes no sense. Settled is an inserted word; the only verb in this phrase is "to be." This is also past tense, not future.

And he has been named

Again, past tense.

Now we come to the names. Hebrew does not have a present tense "is" verb, so this can be taken as a list or "___ is ____". Let's take it word by word.



This is not wonderful, but wonder. It could be an adjective, but properly translated as wonderous.



This can either the verb or the noun: counselor or counseled/determined.

 

there is no "the" here; mighty God is the right translation. Certain phrasing in English will need the for proper grammar, but not the list form.



Again, not "the." Eternal Father.

-

Either:

* "prince of peace," a quality inherent in the prince;
* or "peaceable prince," a quality describing how he acts
* or "prince that makes peace," describing his actions.

I think I've demonstrated enough that your translation is inaccurate. How best to interpret it is up to debate. 

One final point: Just because the persons name has a quality of God does not mean that he is called God. My name has God in it, but I am not claiming divinity.

P.S. Looking at the Chabad/Rashi, he translates it as the name being -, while the rest is describing God. Also perfectly legitimate. And it makes sense that this is describing Hizkiyahu, because they were contemporaries and this does not seem to be a section about the Messianic age. 




 It doesn't. the translation Christian Bibles use are faulty. 




 Just because something is recorded doesn't mean it was the right thing to do. 




 Not exactly. It has a rotating board of rabbis, but it's something different than a sanhedrin, though they do make halachic rulings. 




 One last point. It's easy. Reporters no longer go into Syria, but they can easily talk about Syria from within Israel. 




 If you get me up to 80%+ and you're on the other side of the stage? You bet your ass I'm going to start spamming it. That's your fault I'm in such a good position, and it does take some skill to land it properly. 




 Just write God. That works best. 




 Bigotry of low expectations, right here folks. 




 8:28-29 says that there was a battle against the king of aram. Do you think this occurred?  




 Eh, there is a point for reform Judaism, but not so much conservative  




 [That's partialism, Patrick!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQLfgaUoQCw) 




 If what they say is right, then the stele is saying that their god is better because over time, during the reign of the king who worshiped that god, they prevailed over the objections of those other kings (and their gods), in taking all the land that they wanted to, from them.

Well, yes. It was written by Aram, after the battle with the kings of Israel in Judah. The same battle where the new Israelite King, according to the Bible, slew the two other kings. The king of Aram claims that he killed those kings, in contradiction to the biblical narrative. 

What battle? There is no such battle.

Read II Kings chapters 8-11 again. What do you mean, no battle?

They created a new history of Israel to fit how they interpret the inscription, ignoring what the Bible actually says.

Can you describe what history you're talking about? All I'm doing is quoting the bible. The researchers just matched up the half names on the steele to the names in Kings, not made up another history. What does the Bible "actually say"?

P.S. The various other claims of  means don't dispute the spelling, but the pronunciation. Like the Wikipedia article says, those claims are pretty weak. 




 Proponents of what interpretation? Who rewrote what? This is in the Bible that was canonized before Christianity even existed. What is your alternative?

And yes, Kings and the steele are definitely describing the same battle and outcome, but with two different claims of what happened. That is how history was written in those days -- each side claimed it won (hell, it still happens).

 That says nothing about joining forces against Judah. Even so, that is a prophecy of what will happen. To look at the actual events, read II Kings. 




 Of course it does. Read your Bible - start with II kings 8:16. You will find a separate narrative about the same events. 




 Apologize to the actual person, if you can. He'll appreciate it even if he never responds. 




 The "House of David" on the tel dan steele is referring to the King of Judah, not the king of Israel.
 

 




 Tell that to the Palestinians, who claim that no Jewish temple ever stood there. 




 I'm getting annoyed at my phone (Droid Razr HD) recently at a couple of things. It's getting hot when I'm not using it and the mobile data in on (just sitting in my pocket), using up a lot of battery power. It is also running really slowly, especially when switching between apps. So I have a couple of questions:

1. Is there any way to view and cancel background programs from running?
2. What might be the cause of using so much power when I'm not using my phone?
3. Is there any way to cancel individual app permissions?

If any of this requires me to root my phone, I would appreciate step by step instructions. Thank you! 




 He didn't fulfill the most important ones, namely bringing all the Jews back to Israel and ushering in a golden age for humanity. Which ones did he fulfill, do you think? 




 No, the OT says that Jesus rises from the dead doesn't make him a prophet or in the right. He's not the messiah for different, reasons, namely that he didn't fulfill those prophecies.

I don't come at Christianity with a presumption of Judaism, I come at it with the presumption of atheism

Wonderful, but Christianity itself bases its claims upon Judaism being correct. To be Christian means to accept the OT. 









 The NT definitely punishes thought crimes,

Alright, just please make the distinction between the NT and the OT then. 




  The law says "Don't be gay"

No, it says: "Men, don't have sex with men." Homosexuality wasn't even a concept at that point. Nowhere, outside of jealousy, does the Torah ever condemn thoughts. 




 You said the basis of your faith is that Jesus rose from the dead. But the OT, which you claim is authoritative, definitively says that this doesn't make a difference. How can you reconcile the two? 




 Next up, they'll have to ban premarital sex because it will lead to more mixed dancing, which "desecrates one of the fundamental principles of Judaism!" 




 I don't feel like a male thats effeminate, i feel like a woman

What do you mean if this doesn't include body dysphoria? 




 According to Wikipedia, Socrates was born in 470 BCE and Aristotle was born in 384. 




 Aristotle is typically put as one of the Fathers of Greek ~~philosophy~~ science. He lived in the 4th century BCE, a little after Malachi. 




 Why are you not comfortable identifying as male and just acting in different ways? 




 The fact that the Torah was revealed to all of Israel at once. 




 In Israel just a shroud, outside of Israel a box. 




 A human claiming "I am God" is certainly something different -- and rising from the dead doesn't prove it one way or another. 




 I don't need one. The Torah tells us not to listen to prophets who teach a contradictory message, no matter what miracles they perform. 




 The Romans, in order to insult the Jews more! 




 And if Jesus rose from the dead, it still doesn't prove anything. 




 National Revelation. 




 No it isn't! 




 Darkness is chosech, previously in the verse. Darkness is contrasted to light, and evil is contrasted to peace/wholeness. Where you get sin from, I have no idea. 




 A good discussion is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/2ac8t8/i_form_the_light_and_create_darkness_i_make_peace/citl9hi) 




 This will be incredible. But why for only those who purchase both...? 




 Ok, Huge Pizza Hog, I think it's time for you to begin. 




 SPECIAL SMASH IS BAAAACK!! 




 8 player smash confirmed!!! 




 But I thought that it was the father speaking that line, since Jesus hadn't previously revealed himself at all?

And anyone can forgive sins; someone comes to apologize to you for something they did to harm you and you forgive them. Poof. Bye sins! You have to do the same thing with God.

You still haven't answered me about Isaiah 43. You ready to debate that?

 




 I would assume you think so, that's what your argument it based on, inst it?
 




 You heard (read?) me. By the your circular logic that is true, but if Jesus didn't save anybody he can't be God, can he?
 




 In them two verses God is saying that there is no saviour beside himself, and verses including Acts 4:12, Luke 2:11, John 4:42 , etc declare that only Christ Jesus is the saviour of the world. Thus Jesus is God.

Or maybe those quotes are just...wrong?

Also, Isaiah 53 is definitely not about the Messiah, and certainly not about Jesus. ready to debate that? 




 Evil is the best translation, as in genesis 3.

 750,000 Palestinians were exiled

True.

through the use of terror attacks such as the Deir Yassin massacre

Not true. Deir Yassin is so infamous precisely because it only happened once, and not by the Haganah/IDF.

the destruction of hundreds of Palestinian villages

Never seen a good citation for this. Dozens? Probably, mostly along the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem road because they were being used as shelters for the attackers. Lod is another example. But most of the villages were in the Galil, and many were untouched or the inhabitants fled in advance.

 Palestinians were bound to retaliate in the following years.

800,000 Jews were exiled from Arab countries, and the inhabitants of the Old City, kfar etzion, and other areas had to evacuate, were expelled, or were massacred. Did they not have the right to retaliate?

 




 Fedayeen, I apologize. See [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_attacks_against_Israeli_civilians_before_1967), if you don't already know.

Also, the PLO itself was founded in 1964, but the groups that make it up (Fatah, etc.) existed before. Fatah, for example, was established in 1959. Many of the attacks didn't come from the PLO of today, but were carried out an sponsored by people who did form the group. ([See here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen)) 




 I see a random list, of which at least 3 at first glance *were* during a war. You still haven't addressed the fact that one list starts at 48 and the other at 68. Look up the ~~mujadeen~~ fedayeen. 




 Just want to point out that the actual source is Aramaic, where it means "He created as he spoke." 




 Never made the news? There were at least three articles about it on *this* subreddit alone. And no, it doesn't provide any context whatsoever. Terrorism is never justifiable.  




 Why the hell are you starting at 1968 for the PLO? The groups that make it up go all the way back to Israel's founding. And the list doesn't even distinguish between military and civilian casualties. If you're trying to make a point, at least give correct information. 




 Then what are you saying? I have no idea what the attack and the connection is between the attack and freedom of movement. 




 Yes, a Hamas operative who has been in jail twice was traumatized by a traffic accident where the perpetrator turned himself in. That's why he killed a baby. 




 If the opponent is dodging a lt, short jump and a turning back slash is extremely effective. 




 The title is from the article. And I wouldn't be surprised if "settlers" is interpreted a bit too loosely; after all, Jews are classified as "members of an enemy state." 

 




 Yes. Are you saying that the fact Palestinians don't have freedom of movement justifies terrorist attacks? 




 What does that have anything to do with this attack?  




 I guess that's news to the Hamas driver who was travelling on the highway that goes straight through Jerusalem that serves both Israeli's and Palestinians. I guess it's also news to Palestinians in East Jerusalem that travel on this same light rail all the time between East and West Jerusalem.

**There are no travel restrictions between East and West Jerusalem, as the distinction currently exists only on a map.**

**There are no travel restrictions between East and West Jerusalem, as the distinction currently exists only on a map.** 




 Anyhow, more to your point the fact that Israelis can easily waltz across the border and not vice versa is kind of the problem.

The fact that Palestinians and Jews can travel freely in Jerusalem is a problem? 




 Not true. 




 The terror attack was literally [right at the border](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Light_Rail#mediaviewer/File:Jerusalemlightrailmap.png) between East and West Jerusalem, right on a highway, a couple of minutes walk from Palestinian neighborhoods. There could have easily been residents of West Jerusalem, tourists, students from Hebrew University, or Palestinians at the station. Are you condemning these people for simply *standing at train station?* 




 Are you really asking why people live in certain places? And did you really just call all of Israel a "Jewish settlement?" 




 Epi-genetic, based on temperatures after the eggs are laid. You can read more in [this explanation](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/experts-temperature-sex-determination-reptiles/) I found. 




 If you trust them, I'm sure you'll be able to find the original sources, right? 




 1. A video they don't link or name, and a statement by the obviously not biased Al-aqsa waqf.
2. Full of outright lies, myths, and STILL doesn't contain any information that anyone wants to destroy Al-Aqsa. 
3. Why does that have anything to do with Jews? 




 Radio? Everything I've seen just says that they praise the attack, but don't take credit. 




 The infant has died while at the hospital. 




 The baby has died, no news on the 8 others injured. 









 The part about uncomfortable/not confident people taking up less space is definitely true, as is the converse. 




 Same as kashrut. These laws are called "chukim" - there are no real explanations. 




 Are the ones is Gush Etzion settlers? Those who returned to their land after their parents were kicked out and massacred?  




 But if you know of them, you can much better understand what they are talking about. Take Isaiah, for example. Lots of Christians misinterpret the book because they have no idea in what time or for whom it was written. But if you do know, and read it in the original language, nearly all your points are moot. 




 And this is why you read it in the original language with knowledge of the authors. 









 It's a metaphor. Since angels don't have free will, everything they do is God's will. 




 The snake is Genesis 3 is just a snake, not Satan. 




 All is under God. Anything else is not monotheism. Is polytheism easier? Absolutely. But that is not what Judaism is. 




 Opposite. God created everything, including evil. The person talking to you about translation is completely wrong. 




 There have been two ([1](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/2chmoo/i_form_the_light_and_create_darkness_i_make_peace/), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/2ac8t8/i_form_the_light_and_create_darkness_i_make_peace/)) recent threads about this recently. The second had the same discussion about moral evil happening now; my rebuttal is in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/2ac8t8/i_form_the_light_and_create_darkness_i_make_peace/citl9hi).

Pretty much all I have to say is there, if you want more details/explanation you can just reply to my comment here. 




 It's amazing how Christians don't seem to know their scripture. 

Chapter 29:

24 they and indeed all the nations will wonder, Why has the Lord done thus to this land? What caused this great display of anger? 25 They will conclude, It is because they abandoned the covenant of the Lord, the God of their ancestors, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt. 26 They turned and served other gods, worshiping them, gods whom they had not known and whom he had not allotted to them; 27 so the anger of the Lord was kindled against that land, bringing on it every curse written in this book. 28 The Lord uprooted them from their land in anger, fury, and great wrath, and cast them into another land, as is now the case.

Essentially what Christians have been saying for a long time, including you above.

When all these things have happened to you, the blessings and the curses that I have set before you, if you call them to mind among all the nations where the Lord your God has driven you, 2 and return to the Lord your God, and you and your children obey him with all your heart and with all your soul, just as I am commanding you today, 3 then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on you, gathering you again from all the peoples among whom the Lord your God has scattered you. 4 Even if you are exiled to the ends of the world,[a] from there the Lord your God will gather you, and from there he will bring you back. 5 The Lord your God will bring you into the land that your ancestors possessed, and you will possess it; he will make you more prosperous and numerous than your ancestors.

**God will not abandon his people.** 




 I have heard that it is ok as long as no money is exchanged, barring ma'arit ayin. 




 Side note: where is the long list of prophecies that were actually fulfilled?

I have never seen an accurate one, probably because very little was actually fulfilled.

once to fulfil the law and once to permanently establish his kingdom.

Why two comings? Why should I believe it? Where in the OT is it said?

We want our spouses to make an informed decision and choose to marry us freely. God wants the same thing - he wants us to choose him freely. 

But the Jews are already married to God! What exactly are we choosing again?

He doesn't establish his kingdom permanently yet (the second coming described by all those prophecies in the list) because he wants to give as many people as possible the chance to make the right choice - but in a way that doesn't force it down their throats.

Then why will Jesus ever come back? Isn't it better to continue giving people the choice? If the second coming will remove the choice, then why have it? Won't it make perfection...less perfect?

And you still haven't established why the prophecies should be fulfilled in the second coming. The messiah isn't the messiah unless he fulfills the prophecies. Doing a vague fulfilling the law thing is not what the messiah is supposed to do.

The first of the non-second coming prophecies in the list:

These are refutations of christian theology, not prophecies.

 Yes, Jesus fulfilled the law

But this doesn't mean anything. The law cannot be "fulfilled." It is something to do in perpetuity, not something to be done once.

but he also said he didn't come to abolish it. He didn't tell anyone they should stop following the law. 

But Paul did. And Christianity has followed his teachings.

He just fulfilled its requirements for all mankind

Again, no such thing. Second, the law never applied to everyone, just to the Children of Israel. 

 It is impossible for humans to keep the law and therefore everyone is judged a sinner and therefore everyone is condemned to die under the law because perfect righteousness cannot abide even the smallest amount of sin.

Woah woah woah. None of these statements follow. Let's go through them one by one.

It is impossible for humans to keep the law

Yes, it is impossible for everyone to be perfect. God knew this when the law was handed down at Sinai, which is why a repentance was established as in option. Coincidentally, we are in the middle of the period devoted to repentance.

therefore everyone is judged a sinner

Everyone has sinned, but everyone can repent. Once you repent, the sin is washed clean.

therefore everyone is condemned to die under the law

One is not condemned to die just because you sin. Lots of people sinned in the Torah, and they didn't immediately die. There are very few sins whose punishment is death.

perfect righteousness cannot abide even the smallest amount of sin

This statement doesn't even make sense. 

So, everyone is condemned to die

Again, doesn't follow.

unless, someone qualified steps up and takes on the punishment.

And even if it did, how is it justice for someone else to take your punishment for you? In fact, you should feel ashamed for allowing someone else to make the sacrifice you weren't able to make yourself.

The one that takes on the punishment has to be human, 

Again, this doesn't make sense. But if it did, why must they be human?

but they also have to be perfect so that they have the right and the qualification to take on the punishment of the imperfect.

Again, why? Even if you would make a substitution for a regular murder, the person who takes it doesn't have to be perfect.

And once the punishment has been meted out

And you think the law is for punishment, and once the punishment is gone the law can be gone? That's an awful view to take for something God given.

 the requirements of the law are fulfilled. But the law is not abolished.

It becomes the same thing. The law we are commanded to keep eternally would no longer be followed.

And then they refute that by saying that God is ONE. But they don't quote any scripture to back that up 

Yes, they do. Duet. 6:4

d I already refuted that claim in the above post - there are many places in the Torah that describe God as both ONE and MORE THAN ONE. The trinity isn't a foreign concept to the scriptures.

It is completely foreign. But that discussion is for another post. 




 What did he do, and how did he get farther than Jesus?

[He almost succeeded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt) at expelling the Romans, creating a sovereign state, and rebuilding the Temple, returning Israel to it's former glory. Unfortunately, he failed, and that's that.

Prophecies.

Jesus didn't fulfill them.

Resurrection. Healings of the sick and afflicted.

What does these have to do with the Messiah?

 




 Translations are actually rather easy. Look at all the other occurrences, as well as the root word, and see what meaning it could be. You can do it yourself, [here's the link](http://biblehub.com/hebrew/strongs_5959.htm). Look through each of the occurrences. Where can it mean specifically virgin, of which there is already a word in hebrew, as opposed to young woman. 




 Above you. 




 You can think a lot of things. Why do you think this with all the quotes of the Torah going against you? And that doesn't at all disqualify a trinitarian God either if it's all made up?  
























 My mistake, it was a typo. Thanks!

As this is my first build, are there any peripherals I would need which I wouldn't think of? (And on that note, is there a wifi card/adapter you would recommend?  




 I'll get one when I start overclocking in the future. Thank you! 




 Sorry, I'm **not** overclocking, but I might in the future. I have a huge backlog of older games to play before I start on new ones, and I'm not too picky about FPS. I'll save the OC for the future. 




 Thanks for your help! I just bought everything today. I'm hoping to build it over thanksgiving. My final build:

 This is my build. This forum has helped me a lot over the past few weeks, so I'm going to ask one last time before I commit. I am NOT overclocking right now, but I'm leaving it open as option for the future. The parts are all bought, and currently unopened and returnable. Can I change anything to make it better?

 Haven't heard of it before now, and i'm a FE fan. thanks! 




 What is this game? 




 For free? Damn, I missed that. Hopefully it comes up again. 




 Is it worth it to get dragon age at this price, or should I wait? 




 Copy paste is magic!

Isaiah 53 is very clearly talking about the Children of Israel, though it is obscured by the way Christians separated the chapters. If you look at 52: 13-15 (which is the same section that starts with chapter 50), you can see that the prophet introduces a "servant" in third person. 13 says that the servant will be exalted, 14 that (in past tense) "marred beyond man is his appearance," 15 that (in future tense) how kings and nations will react.
Then, in 53:1, the narrative shifts to the perspective of those kings and nations, who are talking about the servant after he has risen and exalted. In the past, "he had not form," "he was despised," etc. But now "He has grown," "he might see offspring," etc. Then in the second half of verse 11 the narrative shift back to prophet, who describes the servant a bit more.

Now how is it possible that, during the time the prophet was speaking, Jesus was already marred, and that nations were appalled (did this ever happen?). Only in the future will the nations say "As one who hid his face from us, he was despised, we held him to no account." Did they ever say this about Jesus? On the other hand, (the house of) Israel fulfills all of this!

In context with chapters 52 and 54, if one is a believer, one could see the prophecy be fulfilled today. If you read the entire section, chapter 53 is actually the pivot between a mourning Israel/Jerusalem and a joyous one, it makes sense why Israel would be referred as a "suffering servant" here.

As for what the prophecies of the Messiah actually are, that was addressed elsewhere. 




 says you, this is not what the person that originally wrote the text believed is it?

Because the punishment for sex before marriage is zero, while adultery's is stoning. Can you give an argument aside from "well that's what you say?"

 there are seven laws to match the seven virtues and seven sins

or maybe the opposite, don't you think?

these of course stem from the seven visible astral bodies common to the ancient religions

Never heard of this. Link please?

again, this is entirely your opinion and not in anyway proven fact, what the author intended is unknown and has been debated often -- you seem to be arguing from the stance that adam and eve really were the first people created and that all humanity stems from them, as you're no doubt aware this view is contentious even within modern Judaism, it's certainly not accepted by secular science.

If we're talking about the author's intent, secular science doesn't matter. If you're disputing my claim about Genesis 9:4, here's the simple proof: The text itself. Adam was given only the plants to eat, while Noah was given the animals (9:3). How is allowing you to eat animals encouraging vegetarianism? Yes, it might say vegetarianism is preferable, but eating meat is certainly allowed -- but eating blood is not.

The reality is...

I have no idea what your point is here, it seems you're just rambling. 

to say you can claim with absolute authority that you know what the author of the commandments intended to convey is just sillyness(sic).

You only have one way of evaluating this, via the text. I get my claims from analysis, not just by "knowing." You want to say I'm wrong, prove me wrong.

uh, it's from the exact bit i was just talking about and how it's clearly actually intended to be a reference to the same thing mentioned in the commandment.

No, grafting is not part of the Noahide law. It is given to Jews, as "don't plant two types of seeds in a field (Lev. 19:19). It has nothing to do with Noah, or animals, or blood.

yes secular law is important because the vague notions hinted at by idealogical theologians as formed into firm sounding aphorisms are entirely meaningless - are you suggesting that the all wise god in his infinite glory decided to troll us with a set of laws with absolutely no use for no reason but to inspire us to craft sensible ones for his followers to oppose on religious grounds? [as the abolution of slavery, womens lib, civil lib and etc, etc, etc have and often still are fought against in the name of the lord?]

You sound like you have a chip on your shoulder. God gave us laws, and the tools with which to create more related to our situations. We are not yet in the Messianic age. 




 brings up the fascinating question of what is a false god, i guess Jesus Christ counts right?

Possibly. It is an argument.

likewise adultery, what does it mean? today we use this to mean clandestine extra-marital sex but it can, and did, mean a much more general thing including sex before marriage.

It means consensual sex when you are engaged or married to another person. Sex before marriage is not adultery.

Seven is the most absurd of course, take an example - are we to say that Martin Luther King for example did not support the rule of law but he did support justice?

Laws between society differ. Just because this is complicated doesn't mean it is absurd. You're way of interpretation isn't necessarily correct, and you're jumping to the worst possible conclusion.

number six of course is kinda bizarre, and lets be honest here you're not kidding anyone - certainly not the all knowing king of kings, if he's still about - but first let's assume your version is how it's intended,

You're not making sense, of course this is what is intended. Why do you think differently?

 doesn't that fact that with only seven slots available one of them is dedicated to something so ridiculous kinda make the whole set look silly

That's only with your incorrect assumption that there are only seven slots. If this law wouldn't be there, there would only be six, and if another one needed to be tacked on, it would be 8. No cosmic force is forcing seven laws over any other number. I'm not going to go into the why of it now.

If this rule ever meant anything it's tied to Genesis 9:4  But flesh with its soul, [which is] its blood, you shall not eat' which is a pretty clear call to if not total vegetarianism at least abstaining from red meat, something likely copied from the other religions of the region and 'updated' in much the way Paul 'updates' foreskins for Christians

You are absolutely wrong. That says that you can't eat the blood of the animal, not to be vegetarian. In fact, Adam and his descendants were originally vegetarians, and only Noah and his descendants were allowed meat after the flood. 

As i'm sure you're aware the traditional Jewish interpretation understands this as being a rule which even forbids the grafting of different species of fruit trees - a method of yield boosting now pretty much default the world over.

Wrong. That is from somewhere entirely different.

as for the others, is piracy theft? or is property theft? what is murder? is war murder? is poverty murder? is self-defence murder? in which case what is self-defence? is forcing your reluctant wife to sleep with you rape?

Good questions! These are things to be ironed out, don't you agree? That is what the rule of law is for.  




 Yeah, I don't have that kind of money to spend. :P do you have a reccomendation for a Z97 mobo under $100? 




 Yes, through the 30th 




 This is my build:

I'm thinking of upgrading the motherboard, since I managed to save money elsewhere, I might want to overclock in the future, and the computer will only be as strong as it's weakest link. 

I'm willing to go to about $650 for the build, which would gives me an extra $80 for the mobo, give or take. Micro Center is having a deal for $40 off a motherboard with a i5-4690k. What can I get that is under $120 on [this list](http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/29c358a7#/29c358a7/33)
of eligible motherboards, that is the best price for performance? I'm not looking for extremely high end, and my preferred price would be $70. What do you think? 




 I have no idea what to look for.  Could you link me to something that will help?  




 Wow, ok. I'm updating from a crappy laptop, so this is amazing. I don't really care about going over 60FPS, as my monitor won't support it; I care more about smooth performance over high graphics anyway. What about some of the newer games, like DA:I?

This is my current build. What will I be able to play with this? Can I play Skyrim on ultra at 60FPS, for example? How about some of the newer games that are just now coming out? Thank you! 




 That case was $65 FOUR days ago. Argh. Other recommendations have been corsair 200R/300R and the NZXT S340. What are your opinions on those?

I'm at the Boston MC, which I think has pretty much everything new in stock. But it seems like all the mAtx sold are actually *more* expensive, so I might go with the ATX instead. There are just so many options that are hard to tell apart. :/ The Z87 boards are a lot cheaper -- would there be a significant drop in performance, or another reason not to get them? I'm looking at [this one](http://www.microcenter.com/product/417392/Z87_PRO3_Socket_LGA_1150_ATX_Intel_Motherboard_-_Refurbished) in particular. 




 The motherboard is part of a microcenter deal of $40 off a cpu and mobo. Motherboards are more complicated than almost anything else, so I'm not exactly sure what I should get. Is there a relatively cheap unlockable mobo? Also, what is better in the long run -- Atx or mAtx?

The case was recommended to me. What is another good budget case that you know of?

 




 Not sold at microcenter, unfortunately. I'm not passing up their $40 off a mobo deal 




 I wanted to keep it under $800 maximum, and preferably closer to $600. Do you know of an overclockable but still inexpensive motherboard?
 




 Ok, how can I make my current build more upgradable? This is what I'm currently getting:

Can I do anything better? 




 I'm not actually going for overclocking, that's just the best deal MC has. Would I *need* a Z97 or else the build won't work, or can the CPU and mobo still work like this? 




 I'm also building something similar for the first time (and on a budget), so here is what I got so far:

I don't need to overclock, but Microcenter is offering a deal for $40 off the motherboard for certain cpu's, so the 4690k saved me $20. Is  this a good budget build? What do you think? 




 My body is ready, but my wallet is empty... 




 What are the differences between all the different types of Motherboards? This is my current, potential-but-not-right-now overclocking build:

As this is my first time building, I want a mid-Tower: Enough space to maneuver in, but also not huge. I don't want to spend too much on the case, and I don't care too much about style. What are my best options? 




 How can you use the OS without using these? 




 For what reason? 




 I'm building a new PC, and I'm not sure which one to get. Both are free. Windows 7 is older, but I've heard nothing but bad news about 8. Which one would you recommend?  




 http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/29c358a7#/29c358a7/33 




 Yeah. Unfortunately my MC doesn't have that mobo in stock. :( 




 That's $70 more, not $30 




 shhhhh, it's a myssssstery. 




 Simple question: What do you do for the best price? Is it better to buy now and on Black Friday, or is it better to wait and get post-Black Friday sales? 




 Should I jump on sales now or wait for after Black Friday? 




 I building the exact same computer as you. Just know that Microcenter currently has a deal for $40 off the motherboard if you buy a 4690k! 




  Obviously there are exceptions to this. And having gender-neutral bathrooms shouldn't involve the removal of urinals. But why not just have one big fucking bathroom with all the stalls and urinals?

Maybe because some people are uncomfortable with it, and they would rather only have people of the same sex in the bathroom? Especially when the bathroom includes showers, for example? Should these be denied a comfortable space? 




 Yeah, I saw that. I JUST ordered the 600W one yesterday, so I'm seeing if I can cancel it. I'm going to micro center soon to pick up the last parts so I'll hopefully build it sometime next week. I can't wait to actually play games decently; and not just decently, but good.

Good luck with yours!

Looks like you're overclocking and I'm not, otherwise these are pretty much the same. I'm also thinking about switching the PSU, and I got a cheaper RAM deal. It's reassuring that we have the same build, it means I probably didn't screw up! 




 Are you me? I'm doing the exact same thing, except my laptop is four years old. want to compare? 




 This is incorrect. The hebrew word in the texts of Isaiah could be understand as either maiden or virgin but the Greek word used in the New Testament has no such ambiguity. It only means virgin. The writers of the New Testament understood the words of Isaiah to mean "virgin" and that is why the Greek word for virgin is used and not the Greek word for "maiden".

This is one of the most conceited things I have ever heard. You think your translation, written hundreds of years later, is better than the original text?
 




 I'm getting i5 4590k, and it's the first time building a computer. Thanks for the chance! 




 Currently, there is a 2TB Hybrid SSD on sale for $80 on amazon. What are the advantages and disadvantages of a hybrid vs. a HDD or regular SDD? 




 If I want to spend $50-70, what is the best one to get? 




 Is the tomb raider bundle worth it? I've never played a tomb raider game before. 




 Right now it's $130 on newegg. How does it compare to the one I'm getting? 




 Ow well. This is the first time building a computer anyway, so take my advice with a grain of salt. 




 If you have access to microcenter, I have a very good and cheap build I'm making. Take a look at my history. 









 It's called both, depending on who you're talking to.

My laptop was expensive in 2010, but probably the most expensive piece of junk for gaming you could buy. I got sick of barely even being able to play Morrowind, so I decided to finally get off my ass and do something about it.

I don't know much about building, so I looked for the cheapest prices for the best components. I really only need games to run on high at 30 FPS, but I would like this to last for some years. I think I got some pretty good deals for that. What do you think? Anything I should change? 




 Switched, thank you. 




 I took the SSD because it seemed really cheap for the amount of storage, and the 128GB isn't that much less expensive. 
 
Thanks for the ram tip.

I'm not sold on any of this -- if you have a better idea, let me know! This is my first time building, so I've been a little bit lost the last couple of days. Anything I should change? I'm trying to build a gaming pc which will run new games smoothly on high/ultra for the next 4-5 years (I'm fine going to 30FPS). Anything else I should look at? Are there better deals? Thank you! 




 The non-k series is actually more expensive right now oddly enough 




 I'm not; I'm only getting a such good cpu and graphics card because they're so cheap for the power, and they will last a long time. 
 




 The SSD is $20 off at microcenter, and I might wait for a sale on a different 1TB hard drive. Do all the parts fit together, and will I need anything else? I have a monitor, OS, etc. already.

 Ah, drat, you seem to be right. And the dell forums said no other boards will fit. :( I'll take it apart to check anyway, but it looks like a new case is in order. 




 How do I do that? 




 Great explanation, thank you. I'll make my list and check back to buildapc when it's finished to make sure all the parts are good. 




 Alright, I'll open up the case tomorrow and poke around. 

Another noob question, if you don't mind: I'm finding lots of differently priced options for video cards. For example, the Radeon R9 280: [This](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J7YFUPA/?tag=pcpapi-20) vs. [this](http://www.amazon.com/Sapphire-Radeon-PCI-Express-Graphics-11230-00-20G/dp/B00IZXOW80/? tag=bom-tomshardware-20). Are there significant differences, or should I just get the cheapest? 




 Thank you! Is there any reason not to get a better graphics card? I'm looking at the Radeon R9 280, for example, which is currently $140 




 Thank you. What does OEM mean?

This one is 17" long, 7.5" wide, and 16" tall. Is this standard? 




 Thank you! 




 I haven't had any pride for years!

I'm new at this, and I'm going for a relatively cheap build. What are the advantages of getting a new case? 




 No, I'm cheap. :P But seriously, are there any technical reasons not to use an old case? 




 I have an old case from around 10 years ago, which originally ran windows vista. It is a mid-tower. Is there any reason not to use it and instead get a new one?

[Link to the exact case.](http://www.pcworld.com/product/29437/dell-dimension-e521.html)

Thanks! 




 Is there any reason not to use an older case? I have one from about 10 years ago, and would use it if I could. ([Link to case](http://www.pcworld.com/product/29437/dell-dimension-e521.html)) 




 Thanks! I'm not even sure what I'm even buying yet, but this seemed the right price for a good card. I just wanted to make sure that this wasn't a steal.  




 Is it worth it to buy the video card right now? That is a large price off. 




 But that is not what the maps show... 




 He needs therapy, today.  




 And by "we", the jews mean "dead members of our ~~religion~~ tribe about 3500 years ago, which we know because ~~it's written in a book~~ our ancestors told it to their children, who told it to their children, and which is written down in a book we've been passing down for all of those generations that we read in its original language".

Whereas when the mormons say "they", it means "dead members of ~~our religion~~ a random tribe from 2500 years ago, which we know because it's written in ~~a book~~ some random text who this one person translated".

 




 Because the Mormons say that "they mass witnessed something," while Jews say "**we** mass witnessed something." 




 Wikipedia! But what does that have to do with this discussion? 




 **What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

Gaming, programming, Internet and watching movies. I'm not too picky about graphics; I just need something like Skyrim, for example to run on high at around 30 FPS. I'm more interested in smooth graphics than impressive ones.

**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

$600-800

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

Anytime in the next two months, when the best deals will be.

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

Everything aside from the OS, monitor, keyboard, and mouse.

**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

Massachusetts, and yes.

**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

Probably just older ones from around the house. Would this be a problem?

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

No, probably not.

**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

I would want a decent amount of storage so that I don't have to worry about it anytime soon, but that is all.

**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

No.

**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**

No, but is there a preference for one or the other?

**Extra info or particulars:**

I'm just sick of having a bad laptop and want something decent, and that will be able to last at least a couple of years. (I can barely play Morrowind right now.) Thank you! 




 Open up the book and see what it says

"This says my ancestors all stood at this mountain and listened to a god. I asked my dad and said he never heard of it. Why should I listen to you?"  




 No, the difference is that eternity will eventually answer. 




 The Palestinians are saying it is tainted by prayer, not us. 




 Yom Kippur is just a day of concentrated repentance, and only for sins between man and God. 

[This](http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/Jewish_Holidays/Yom_Kippur/In_the_Community/Prayer_Services/Confession/Confessing_Sins/Connecting_Sin_and_Repentance.shtml?p=0) is a short primer on repentance in Judaism, and [here](http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/story/repentance) is a deeper look into the subject. 

 




 Just google either. There is only a slight difference but I appreciate your need to be pedantic to attempt to prove your point.

Hey, you asked, I answered. It is definitely ethnic cleansing.

In any case, Israel has been a bad neighbor, they have no one to blame for any bad feelings towards them in the region but themselves.

Really? You think Israel is to blame for all the wars it has fought? 

What about Ethiopian Jews?

Originally from the Levant. And even if they weren't, people can be adopted into the tribe. 




 Fan fiction.  




 Nope, not at all. Why are you equating the fruit to all sin? There are specific punishments for specific sins, and specific ways to repent for specific sins. If every sin caused death, we would all be dead long ago.

Life is about improving yourself, not about dying. 




 The price to pay for sinning is dying.

But this is not true. 




 ~~telling~~ toeing the line

FTFY

 




 Ethnic cleansing and genocide are two distinct crimes, though they are often wrongly conflated by people who like throwing out buzzwords. And Jews are an ethnic group who share the religion Judaism. 




 They are also a bit of a far cry from voting on whether or not Jews should be ethnically cleansed from the region.

What do you think "return to their home countries" mean aside from ethnic cleansing? 




 Not Judaism! 




 To get your edit out of the way first, you cannot directly cause an action which is intended to give you a benefit that breaks Shabbat. It gets complicated, but this definitely falls under forbidden.

To me, yes, it is entirely indisputable that igniting a gas by way of a spark is the same thing as lighting a fire. Do you have an argument to how it is different? 




 Because then you would know that lighting a fire, especially in regards to a car, is not a more complicated subject. Yes, there are always deeper layers, but this is not one of them. 




 So why don't you learn the sources instead of criticizing it? 




 Yes, and everyone will agree with you (I hope). But to some, observing Judaism (the active part of being Jewish) is taking that commitment. 




 Not really, there is a reason it is its own movement and not a sub group. But, even so, what's your point? 




 Not true. If you want to say it is similar in principle, you have to prove it from the theology. 




 Just because it was formed out of Reform, does not mean it is comparable to reform. 




 I do not, personally, try to live my life in order to "fit in" with Christian society.

He didn't say that, just that it was originally founded to fit in more with Christian society, which is pretty much indisputable. Reform has changed quite a lot in the past 150 years.

In addition, you are kind of are admitting it. You are just using "modern" instead of Christian, but it has the same connotation: the mitzvot, as enumerated by the rabbis, are not something you want to totally incorporate into your life. That's fine, but it is not the same thing as Judaism was before.
 




 A 50 year ceasefire does not mean "Openly at war" still. You sound like one of the idiots that thinks North Korea and America are suddenly just going to start shooting each other at the drop of a hat.

Do you not follow the news? That border, though quiet, has been seen a number of attacks since the last ceasefire. Israel can and will bomb Syria at the drop of a hat if it feels threatened, like transfers of long range missiles to Hezbollah.

Israel helping ISIS and other rebel groups though this conflict by bombing SAA bases has just further destabilized this conflict, 

Israel has only bombed in two situations: In the case of a threat like above, or if any fire lands on Israel's side of the border. If they were bombing bases like America, you would hear about it. 




 You think Israel and Syria aren't at war? Wow. 




 Yes, and they have been at war for decades. 




 tell me, how is it racist? 




 is that supposed to be a bad thing? 




 There been a lot tension in Jerusalem with the Al-Aqsa Mosque and settlement.

What exactly is your view of what is happening there? 




 They will if they ever get control. 




  Something happened to cause multitudes of people to change their faiths from Judaism to Christianity against the establishment,

This didn't happen, unless by multitudes you mean "dozens." Almost all of the converts were Roman, not Jewish. 




 Is there any way to corroborate this? Right now all there is as evidence is one unsourced comment on the article.
