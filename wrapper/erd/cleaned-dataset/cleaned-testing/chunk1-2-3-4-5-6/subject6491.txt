 Who wouldn't want to watch episodes named Antipasti, Minestrone, Pane, Pizza (highest rated episode ever), Spaghetti and for season finale, Tiramisu.
 













































































































 This accusation coming from Wendy got me thinking, what if Kendal isn't innocent and was telling (partially) the truth? This is by far the most diskish move by Raylan and he's willing to put a manipulated boy (guilty or not) 40 years in prison just to get his chance at his big brother. And if he didn't do it? "Well, that makes it worse". 



















 Let's say I use Arc with 40% chance of shock (10% from gem + 10% from quality + 20% from passive nodes). If I link Chain to it, I hit more enemies, and have better chance to trigger shock. However, Chain also reduces the damage considerably. If I understand this correctly, shock has a minimum duration that is derived from damage. So less damage means less duration, and if the duration is below the required minimum, shock won't trigger. 

Can anybody shed a light on this subject?

 I'm currently using Moon+ Reader Pro for reading, and I'm happy with it, but I never found the speed reading to be very useful. 

I've just read this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1yvvam/software_that_speeds_up_your_reading_to_500_words/) and I thought maybe I'll give other apps another shot.

My requirements are: ability to open any epub/mobi book on the device, speed settings, and one-sentence-at-a-time UI.

Thanks!

 On the face of it, House of Cards is another political drama, telling the story of one congressman on his way to gain power. I usually hate this kind of television, telling us how great government is and how people with opposite views learn to come and work together. However, this show arguably provides the best criticism today on government and politics in their current form.

Nobody on the show cares about the public, and everybody's working out of self-preservation, narrow political interests, ego and selfishness. 

Bills, projects, acts, executive orders and such, are all introduced, executed, canceled, supported or opposed based on the political points, and almost never on 'what is right for the people'. It shows how people with political power can crash regular people and businesses standing in their way.

The writing is almost always cynic. Phrases like 'I have no ulterior motive here' are always there to hide something else. 

There's also some nice criticism on representative democracy. Season 1/2 **spoiler**: When the congressman sworn to VP (replacing the existing one), he looks at the camera and say: 'One heartbeat away from the presidency, and not a single vote cast in my name. Democracy is so overrated.'

Another nice touch is that the anti-hero is a democrat. So most of the people who abuses power and deceives are from the left.

Anyway, besides the criminal aspect of the story (which I think can be regarded as fiction and not a true demonstration of politicians) the entire system is pained in very unflattering colors.

 Here's something the bugs my mind. Let's say your country descend (ascend?) into anarchy. Who should take over the parks, roads, rivers, sea and other public areas?

Private hands, sure, but the way I see it, everyone has a right to this stolen land, and everyone can claim ownership of it. So who'll get it? 










































































 If you are waiting for a particular deal on an item or just want to see the daily deal in your rss reader without checking the website everyday, here are instructions on how to it.

First, create RSS feed from the daily deal page. To do that, go to a site called [feed43](http://feed43.com/). It's free and no need to sign up. Click [Create your own feed](http://feed43.com/feed.html?action=new).

Step 1. 

Put in the page address: https://www.pathofexile.com/shop/category/daily-deals and click reload.

Step 2. 

Leave the first box empty (Global Search Pattern).

Put the following [text](http://pastebin.com/S3z7v82C) in the second box (Item Search Pattern):

    img class="itemImage" src="{%}"{*}/{*}h1 class="name"{%}/h1{*}div class="description"{%}/div{*}div class="label"{%}/div{*}div class="value"{%}/div{*}div class="totalCost"{%}/div

Click Extract.

Step 3.

Fill the properties:

* Feed Title: Path of Exile - Daily Deal RSS
* Feed Link: https://www.pathofexile.com/shop/category/daily-deals
* Feed Description: Path of Exile - Daily Deal RSS
* Item Title Template: {%2}
* Item Link Template: https://www.pathofexile.com/shop/category/daily-deals

Item content Template:

    
    {%2} - {%3}/br/br{%4}{%5}. strongDaily Deal: {%6}/strong/br/brimg src="{%1}"/

This is an [image](http://i.imgur.com/kMzdLJ4.png) of how step 3 looks like.


Click Preview and you are done. You can now take the feed URL and use it in your favorite RSS reader.

*Just a quick note: the reason I'm not sharing my feed (and neither should you) is because feed43 limits the pull requests to few hundreds a day. More than 500/hour will get the IP banned.*

*Also, this feed will break if/when GGG changes their html layout. I hope it won't happen often.*


Now that you have the feed and you want to create an email alert, you can use a service called [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/myrecipes/personal/new). There are some straight forward steps to create what they call a recipe. Simply choose **Feed** as a trigger - New Feed Item Matches - Keyword: put the item you are waiting for, like "Black Cat Pet", Feed: put the URL from feed43. - Create Trigger - Email - your email information.

That's it. Hope you found it helpful. 





























 I see that many are asking about ways to evaluate items and decide which to keep and which to vendor. So I'm sharing my personal Excel spreadsheet. It's fast and gives a good snapshot about any Rare item.

First, here's a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/l3grWX6.png). And here's an [album](http://imgur.com/a/3aXcp) with more examples (but I'm going to use the first screenshot in my explanation below)

To use the excel, simply copy the item data in the game (Hover item, click Ctrl+C), then go to the spreadsheet and click the button. No need to paste, that's what the button does.
___
**Here's what you get** 
___

~~ The left table is straight forward and contains all the information about the item.

~~ The top-right table displays all the mods. 

* The rank column shows how the **minimum** range of the roll is ranked within the possible rolls. In the example above, *74% increased Energy Shield* is rank #3, because according to [poemods](http://www.poemods.com/index.php?item_type=helmet)   [PoE mods compendium](http://poetools.com/mods-compendium/), the possible rolls for % increase ES in helmet are:

iLvl|range|description
--|--|--
72 | 101 to 120 |(Unconquerable)
60 | 83 to 100 |(Dauntless)
44 | 65 to 82 |(Fearless)
30 | 47 to 64 |(Resolute)
18 | 29 to 46 |(Strong-Willed)
3 | 11 to 28 |(Protective)

So this roll is ranked #3 on the list. Obviously you want to see ranks 1 or 2.

* You can also notice that 2 mods are shaded. those are the 'sought-after' mods. It's not easy to compile a full list, so I did it just the basics:

If the mod contains: | with value above:
--|--
any Resistance	|20
all Elemental Resistance|	10
maximum Life|	60
maximum Mana|	40
increased Energy Shield|	60
increased Armour|	60
increased Evasion Rating|	60
Movement Speed|	20
increased Rarity|	15
increased Quantity|	15
+ to Gems level|	1
+ to Dex/Str/Int|	30
increased Spell Damage|	20

*If you have some knowledge in Excel, you'll be able to update this list, extend it and modify it to your needs*

~~ The middle right table displays the basic properties of the items.

* Here you'll see two ranks. The first is the rank of the item in the entire category, based on [the official list by GGG](http://www.pathofexile.com/item-data). So in the example above, this helmet is #21 on the list (where #1, [Lion Pelt](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Lion_Pelt), is the best white helmet in the game).

* The second rank is how the item is within its armour specific category. Since the helmet in the example is ES, you want to know how it is ranked within the pure ES category (where [Hubris Circlet](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Hubris_Circlet) is considered the #1 helmet). In this example, the helmet is just the 4th best so don't bother with it.

**You want to see items ranked #1 or #2**

*Note: the second rank is only valid to armour. Weapons have just a single category (ranks within wand, staff, 2H axe, etc.)*

~~ Finally, the bottom right table displays the Armour/Attack values and the implicit mods (Armour, Evasion, ES, Phy Damage, Ele Damage, etc)

* For Armour, the following rolls will get marked:

Armour Stats	| Level 1 | Level 2	
--|--|--
Evasion Rating	|800	|1000
Armour	|800	|1000
Energy Shield	|160	|200

**You want to look at those marked level 2**

____

**So what items should you keep?**
____

You want to keep items that have:

1. 2-3 desirable mods
2. Rolls are ranked #1
3. Item is ranked 1-2 within its category
4. The basic stats of the items are level 2 (end game)

About pricing (Domination): Don't get your hopes up. Items usually go for 1 chaos top (rarely 2-3, unless you got some exceptional luck with 4-5 desirable mods, no stupid mods, and high level). Especially if you found them in maps level 72 or less. My recommendation: if an item is in your stash for more than a week, lower the price to 1 alch, if it doesn't go, vendor it and move on. **Good items disappear almost instantly**, so if it's not selling, don't wait.

____

**Batch Mode (!)**
____

If you got this far you probably be happy to know that the spreadsheet supports batch evaluation. Here's how you do it. 

1. Install [this AHK script](http://pastebin.com/W76rk74T).

2. Copy the first item as usual (Ctrl+C)

3. Now go over the rest of the items and click Ctrl+Shift+C. If the item is rare, the data will be added to the clipboard (and not replace it)

4. After you copied up to 10 items, go to the spreadsheet and click the button

5. Now you can use the [up/down arrows](http://i.imgur.com/RZiQ8L0.png) to circle quickly through the items

____

**Download**
____

You can get it from my [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kd9sbxj9zt8xanv/Path%20of%20Exile%20-%20Item%20Eval%20v1.0.xlsm).

Final notes:

* Please don't expect something perfect. It's meant for personal use. 
* Some less common mods are not mapped. 
* Some mods are overlapping (1H/2H/etc). So you might see double readings. 
* I mostly concentrated on Armour and not Weapons. 
* You gonna need Excel 2010, macro enabled (click enable content when prompted). 
* If it's not working for you, or if you have questions on how to expend it and add different values, feel free to pm me.

 New books in Israel are published with a cover price of about $25. You probably think thats too expensive for a book. You are correct. So did the readers in Israel. 

The retail market is dominated by two major chains (have about 80% market share together). In order to compete and sell more books, they started selling them in bundles. Prices dropped constantly, until it settled at 4 books for $30. Thats right, about  of the cover price.

At that point book writers complained that because of the power the publishers have over their contracts, they barely make any money from books sales. 

Writers are paid about 10% of the paid price. So less than $1 for a book. In a very small Hebrew reading market. A best-seller book sells for about 50K copies in 2-4 years span.

Then the government decided to intervene and save the day.
The parliament passed a law last year saying that new books cannot be sold at a discount for the first year. Thats right. The arbitrary number the published picked cannot be changed by the retail seller.

The law came into effect this February. 3 months ago. Thats it.
The situation became dire very quickly. 

Books sales drastically dropped. One of the 2 retail chains is in financial troubles, stopped paying suppliers and will probably declare bankruptcy soon. Publishers stopped signing unknown writers. New books became expensive again, publishers and stores willing to bet on well-known writers only. Some publishers stated they are on the way to close the business. Most of the books that are sold now (75%) are those published before the law took effect and can be sold at deep discount. Independent and small book stores almost dont sell any new books now.

Some customers are saying that 4 books for $30 is too cheap. They say that a book is a cultural item that shouldnt be sold in a deep discount. The say writers should be able to make a living. They got lawmakers on their side, because supporting writers is the noble thing to do.

Well, the market proved them otherwise. 
 


























































































































































 Only now I found out there are two more episodes. I'm very pleased with that too. 


























































































































































 Edit: just adding a bit of a content here, as I never meant it to be love/hate post.

I like the Heat, they are playing my kind of basketball. But I never thought of them as a *steady* team (as opposed to another favorite team of mine, the Spurs, which surprisingly, never even made it twice in a row), so I was surprised to learn that fact today.

I'm not big on basketball history before 88-89, so I can't compare this team to 82 Lakers or 84 Celtics (those are just blurred memories of NBA games I watched as a child, in which the cool kids liked the Celtics, don't ask me why).

Also, I don't think the east is particularly weak in the past 4 years compared to the past 15-20 years. In fact, it looks much stronger. But I may be wrong here.

Anyway, they still got 2 wins to go, and this stat implying it's really not that straight forward to go over this hump. 
































































































































































































































 I'm pretty happy with my build right now, and I want to create it again in the next league. Is there a way to keep a snapshot of it for future reference without fearing the next tree will break the paths?  



























































 I always create a group before going into maps (i farm masters, so I want to share it PA) - the group is created **public**. I cannot change it to private until someone joins. Why is that? it doesn't make sense. 

Also, when the last person (besides me) leaves or even if I kick the last person - the group closes (sometimes it doesn't, I haven't figured out when) and I need to create a new one. Why is that? 

I should be able to create a perma private group. 





























 And 7+ masters should spawn rare areas (up to 6 mods). 














 I'm trying to use life formula to match my actual number, and I'm coming short. 

According to the wiki:

     Life = (38 + (Level * 12) + (Strength / 2) + additive modifiers) * (100% + multiplicative modifiers)

On the gear I have +288 life and +36% to max life (Belly of the Beast). Per PoEBuilder I have +20/+138% from the tree.

So the calculation coming up as:

    Life = (38 + (86 * 12) + (213 / 2) + 20 + 288) * (100% +36% + 138%) =   4067

My life is just over 4200, so where am I missing 200 HP?
 
























 Preferably wrapped up in a GroupBox. Any hints and ideas? Thanks. (PS reading the files isn't the issue here, just the dynamically adding buttons inside a groupbox)

Update. Okay so basically I create those 2 functions, and I think it will work for me (the variables are self explanatory - x,y,w,h and some margins in between):


    add_group(group_number, group_name)
    {
    	global
    	group_y := (group_number - 1) * group_h + 10 
    	Gui, Add, GroupBox, xm ym+%group_y%  Section w%group_w% h%group_h% , %group_name%
    }

    add_button_to_group(sub_name, caption, is_first=false)
    {
    	global
    	if (is_first)
    	{
    		Gui, Add, Button,  xs+%gui_m% 			ys+%gui_m% w%gui_w%  h30 g%sub_name% , %caption%
    	}
    	else
    	{
    		Gui, Add, Button,  xp+%gui_w_margin% 	ys+%gui_m% w%gui_w%  h30 g%sub_name% , %caption%
    	}
    }

To use it, I simply call:

    add_group(1,"Shortcuts #1") 
    add_button_to_group("RunSomething1", "Name #1", true)

    add_group(2,"Shortcuts #2")
    add_button_to_group("RunSomething2", "Name #2", true)
    add_button_to_group("RunSomething3", "Name #3" )

 I just downloaded it and gave it a try, the things I'm missing are:

* Is there a slideshow mode? in BaconReader I can view the post full screen (image, webpage, etc) and then slide right to the next one. Very convenient for image focused subs. Couldn't find this option here.
*  When clicking on a post on the front page, I get directly to the post content. Is there a way to get directly to the comments (skipping the slide up part)?
* Is there a way to collapse all comments by default?
* I have some subs I view often, but I don't want to subscribe to them. So I added them manually without subscribing, that's cool - just like BR. However when I sync my subs, the new ones were deleted. Is it a bug?

Thanks. The app looks great.

 Bob Dylan always had this anti establishment side in him. 

Obama on meeting Bob Dylan:

 Heres what I love about Dylan: He was exactly as youd expect he would be. He wouldnt come to the rehearsal; usually, all these guys are practicing before the set in the evening. He didnt want to take a picture with me; usually all the talent is dying to take a picture with me and Michelle before the show, but he didnt show up to that. He came in and played The Times They Are A-Changin. A beautiful rendition. The guy is so steeped in this stuff that he can just come up with some new arrangement, and the song sounds completely different. Finishes the song, steps off the stage  Im sitting right in the front row  comes up, shakes my hand, sort of tips his head, gives me just a little grin, and then leaves. And that was it  then he left. That was our only interaction with him. And I thought: Thats how you want Bob Dylan, right? You dont want him to be all cheesin and grinnin with you. You want him to be a little skeptical about the whole enterprise. So that was a real treat.  




 But studios are exactly that! They are *active* VC that specialized in music and also have connections to help the business they invest in. What he means is that he's looking for *passive* investors. But that's gonna be a very risky business to be in.

 Have you ever seen art students or amateur artists sitting in a museum im front of a panting, trying to draw it? You are saying they aren't allowed to do that. That I can't draw at home Le Reve and hang it on my wall. That if I can buy parts and build a Mustang, I'm not allowed to do that and put it in my yard. 

That I can't take a guitar, play Stairway to Heaven and keep the recording. Because someone owns those sound waves and I can't move the air on the same way without paying him.

I'm not sure I agree with that. 




 Here's a case for this being a 'right'.

You buy a pencil, you buy paper. You can draw on that paper whatever you want with your pencil. It's your property, it's your right.

You have 5 rooms in your house, you can turn them on and off in any way you like. You can light 2 rooms or 4 rooms. It's your house, your light, your right.

You have a harddrive with billions of bits. You can turn them on and off any way you want. It's your HD, your bits, your pc. BUT if you arrange your bits in a sequence that is similar (not even identical) to a song or a movie or a book, you suddenly break the law and it's not right anymore. Change the first bit, you are golden, change the 10th bit, immoral.

Digital copyright is basically saying someone owns that sequence of bits. Someone owns a number, and you can't copy that number.

 




 Why not switch to digital? Who owns the copyright?

 Kodak can be the opposite example. And anyway, I'm not saying the company will fail, but they can be merged with another big company (let's say, for the sake of argument, LG or Samsung mobile) and call themselves somthing else.  




 But Microsoft doesn't need to be replaced. It can be merged, split or rebrand for the name to be forgotten. We are talking 50 years here, that's eternity in tech terms.

The name Microsoft doesn't have much value. It's not even a popular website or a product (vs. Windows, Office and such). 




 Why is that? 




 You are counting moves, where most of those calculations are referring to *boards* or *games*. You can move your piece backward and forward, but you still have the same board.

 I think a case can be made for Dr Who. First, it's an old show. Even the new seasons have that old vibe. I'm not saying it's bad in any way (nor do the millions of fans need my opinion). I'm saying that a modern US show will lool and feel very different. Second, the style of Dr is kinda cartoonish, where US television brings more realistic production. I don't know if it will be better, but it will sure be different.

 I watched the movie with my gf, she fell asleep in the middle. So when it ended I went to bed depressed and sad and I couldn't even talk about it. On the next day she watched the second half of the film, so I joined her because it's just a fantastic movie. I got sad again by the end, somehow I was hoping that maybe I didn't get it right the first time. Damn.  




 But there isn't 'infinite amount of times'. It's a finite number, we just don't know it. Most importantly, we don't know the ratio between that number and the chance of creating life.

 Yeah, but there's no reasom to hide that, people know the story. It's like in the tv series Hannibal. They don't hide the fact (from the viewer) that he's a serial killer, because most people know that.  




 Yeah, maybe. I think it depends a lot on the native format in which the book was published. Usually bettet to leave it at that format than convert it. 




 Also, after you deDRM it, don't convert to pdf, just install calibre on your laptop. PDF is a lousy format for books.

 Cas as tank, Viv supports, IB damage.  




 Biggest mistake was not using voice acting and let it play in the background while the player moves on. With a AAA budget, I doubt that would have add more than a friction to the costs, but would have added a lot to the experience.  




 I'm gonna upvote you, but no way I'm opening that link. 




 Typing: A bit of a 3 way. Thinking: not impressive enough. Adding: Kinda 4 way. 




 It reminds me of a chart that was published a year ago, about winning actors' average age being much higher than actresses' age. Kind of the same issue. However, im both cases it's a matter of public taste, so if anybody's really bored with their life and want to fill it with some shallow meaning, they should direct it to movies watchers and not the Oscars. 




 Yeah, people seem to forget it's about 2 guys, going to work everyday and doing their job. 




 Of course polygamy should be available to any adults who want it. All other technical issues (inheritance, taxes, etc) should be changed to support that. Too bad it's not a popular concept these days. Popular, as in very few people want to form this kind of family, but those who do, suffer greatly from this discrimination.  




 TIL: when some famous dude found out about some stuff he said some clever shit.

Repeat.  




 Well, to be fair, $ spent now is usually more than a $ spent over time. In the current rates environment that's probably another cent off. 




 literally /r/humblebrag   




 The scales have fallen away from your eyes. You can see you now. 









  ... and when it was eventually over ...

Sounds like he's talking about LOTR extended edition marathon and not sex. 




 Which is still better for him than the other night, when everybody called him Rapey McRapesalot. 




 You just made OP hold his head again. 




 ...yet. Tape measure snakes claim hundreds of victims every year.  




 Actually, as funny as those are, most of them do happen at one point or another. It just ends with 'shit, well, I should pay more attention next time' and not 'shit, I should buy something now on TV to stop it'. 




 That's why the first person to try to detach them during fire will get third degree burns in the hands. 




 If they drove in opposite directions, it means that was a head on collision. This is never a small matter and there's usually enough damage to justify an insurance claim. Exchanging insurance details is not being a dick, it's just getting money from **your insurance** to cover the damages **you need to fix**, that's what you pay them for.

Or, maybe it was bumper collision, no damage, and one of them just remember he forgot something at home and had to turn back. 




 you cant even 




 I didn't see even one action tv show that pulls the baby right. It's usually just a prop, appearing and disappearing when it fits the plot. 




 Like Chris Rock puts it: there's a different between being rich and being wealthy. Shaq is rich. The white dude who writes him his paycheck is wealthy.  




 Some people don't want to kill the fish. They just really want it to be late somewhere.       -- Mitch 




 Yes. Also, Hannibal in *the Silence of the Lambs* didn't age very well in my opinion. It looks a bit of a cliche now. Not to his fault. It's more like a [Seinfeld Is Unfunny](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny) trope. So starting with the TV series is better.  




 I would say because it isn't funny, but that never was an issue at /r/funny. 




 Are we sure it's for consumption? Can the human body digest grass? [Why Can't We Live On Grass?](http://www.scienceshorts.com/Ssw/060617.htm) [Why Can't Humans Eat Grass?](http://www.livescience.com/32435-why-cant-humans-eat-grass.html). Looks like it's edible but not providing anything to the body. 




 Again? damn, this girl can't hold on to a job. No wonder she has to hack to websites to get hired time and time gain. 




 You know your West Wing stuff, but you forgot something. If you watch that episode again, right after the credits, you'll see: based on true future story. 




 Close, but not exactly. Even if you have a valid visa, or a passport from a country with no visa requirements, you still can be flagged and stopped at the border. Again, without providing any explanation to you. You'll be kept in an airport holding facility until travel arrangements back will be arranged. 




 They take DNA for the same reason they take fingerprints and photo for anyone arrested. They keep it for the record and for future crimes. It's for identity purposes, not for immediate analysis.  




  you kick me out of math class  
Now I'm gonna relatively slap your ass ./  
(time 75 min) 




 I love it that someone who really knows shit about shit like Musk responds with: "I'm not sure I am [super genius]". 

This is something that those who claim to be smart never understand: the more you learn, and the smarter you become, you also become more humble and realize how little you know compared to others and to what there is to know. 




 Step 1: she doesn't think I want sex  
Step 2: She let me get close to get quickly  
Step 3: "Just to let everybody know, me and Dan aren't dating! I repeat aren't dating! He's my bff and I'll do anything for him, but we aren't dating. 3 you Dan, I wish I could find someone like you"  
[Step 4](http://i.imgur.com/HbwHN0T.jpg) 




 Good luck making costumes, and being a nanny, and making home videos... speaking of which... would you direct me in the way to see them? putting it bluntly at least. 









 Thanks, I decided to skip it. The show is coming soon anyway, and if history is any guide, it will be over 3 days after. 




 I totally get it. As an amateur writer, by the time I finish writing a story, even a short one, not only that I don't enjoy reading it, I straight out hate it.  




 It does. That's for another story though. 




 "Find this little trick that makes reposters hate him!" 














 Twist: OP knew it's a movie, but Tumblr just don't like Platoon and think it's an overrated movie and a good excuse to hate America's film industry circa 1985. 









 Thought creates reality crap. I remember a scene, probably from that movie, about a guy who is %100 POSITIVE that if he thinks about a parking spot, he'll always find one when he needs it.

Have you ever dc and wanted to continue your conversation or PM the group, but you didn't know their handles? 

As some of you know, PoE keeps chat logs, among other stuff, in a file called client.txt. I wrote a simple script that reads this file (from the end, because it can be very large), and displays them in 4 separate tabs: global, private, group and trade. 

Notes:

* Download the pastebin file, save as .ahk and run. You'll need AutoHotKey 1.1 and above.
* Default client.txt path is  *C:\Program Files (x86)\Grinding Gear Games\Path of Exile\logs\Client.txt* - this can be changed in the script to match your installation settings.
* Default number of characters to read (from the end of the file) is 50000. This can also be changed. bigger number will give more chat messages but longer reading time.
* client.txt should be bigger than that number.

Have fun, and I hope you'll find it useful.  












































 This league I decided to make it more challenging for me and try to be self found only. 

Usually my strategy so far was to pick and use gear up until A3M (group rushing the major bosses in cruel), and get to City of Sarn underleveled and undergeared. At this point I farm currency, adding up to what I already have and get basic gear to carry me through A3M and low level maps (life/es/res).

Alright, so I hit A3M 2 days ago, and I also hit a wall. For the life of me, I couldn't find any decent gear in the past 2 days farming Docks. My resists were around 0%, and obviously you can't survive much like that. 

As much I love this challenge, about an hour ago, I gave up, spent about 8c and got all the gear I need for now.

So after my failed attempt, I really wonder how you do it? how long does it take? did you have any luck so far this league? Do you do it for the challenge or do you just hate trading?

 









 eztv.it was an ideal tv torrent site. Are there any comparable alternatives now that it's down post raid?

The main distinctive feature of the site was that each tv show is listed just once, verified, with different sources to the same torrent. Anything else like that out there? 




 I'm looking for something that will be the hardest to kill up until 75 maps - no Atziri and DPS is less of a priority. Any suggestions? 




 ...Lyrical_ is the first character to enter Palace.

I really don't get how, but it's very impressive. 




 First, a major issue was fixed/set-right: if your default allocation is set to Permanent, and you open a new instance (solo) - the area's allocation will be set to Permanent. Great.

However, I did notice that group's allocation tend to change. We played Graveyard is was PA, went into the cave - it was changed to SA. Same with dock runs. Maybe it's because the leader changed, maybe the first person who entered into the instance. I'm no sure, but I do believe it's happening.

Am I wrong here?

 Gallery mode is when media is displayed 100% width/height of the browser windows (or full screen), other text is gone except title. Back/Forward (or space) jumps to the next media. Other keyboard shortcuts can be used to upvote/downvote/hide (and automatically advance), open comments, etc.

There are some external sites that provide that for Reddit, but none is very good and most don't integrate well with Reddit (voting, saving, hiding, etc.), plus they require credentials which is less secure. 

I think it would be a good and useful addition to RES. 









 If you are unfamiliar with Peaky Blinders, it's a British (BBC2) crime series, about a gang family in Birmingham, England post WWI. The cast includes Cillian Murphy in the leading role (Scarecrow from Nolan's Batman), Sam Neill (Jurassic Park) and is joined by Tom Hardy (Inception, Batman's Bane, Locke) in the second season. 

The soundtrack has tracks by:

* Nick Cave (theme song and through out the series)
* The White Stripes and Jack White
* The Raconteurs
* Tom Waits
* Dan Auerbach
* The Dead Weather
* Johnny Cash
* PJ Harvey
* Arctic Monkeys

 I'm eating right now a superb sweet potato and lentil dish.

1. In a slow cooker, put 3 peeled, cut in chunks sweet potatoes. Carrots and 2 cups of lentils.
2. In a small skillet, heat oil, put some chopped onions. Add some spices: curry, cumin, salt, pepper, ginger root, garlic. Mix. Add 2 cups of chicken broth, stir for a minute and pour everything into the slow cooker.
3. Put on low heat for 6 hours.
4. If you have green beans, add them now, let it cook for another hour.

The recipe is based on that [one](http://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/slow-cooker-curried-sweet-potato-and-lentil-stew/841c60f3-3a01-4dec-bc31-c3e0c964a677), I just added more lentils and I prefer to saute onions before adding them to the cooker.

 Here's **Jamaican Jerk Chicken** from the book: *Slow Cooker Classics from Around the World*.

----

*Jerking is a method of seasoning and cooking meat that dates back to the Carib-Arawak Indians who inhabited Jamaica. Meat is marinated in a spicy pastelike sauce and then cooked slowly. Originally cooks would puncture the meat with a sharp object and stuff the holes with a variety of spices. The meat would then be cooked in a deep pit lined with stones over burning pimento (allspice) wood, which gave it a unique smoky flavor.*

----

#Ingredients

* 1 cup chopped sweet onions, like Vidalia
*  cup chopped scallions
* 1 teaspoon dried thyme or 2 teaspoons fresh thyme
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* 1 teaspoon ground allspice
*  teaspoon ground nutmeg
*  teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 2 whole jalapeo peppers, sliced
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon canola oil
* 1 tablespoon cider vinegar
* 4 pounds cut-up chicken pieces, skin removed

#One day ahead

Place all ingredients except chicken in the bowl of a food processor. Puree, scraping down the sides of the bowl several times, until mixture is smooth. Place chicken in a large freezer-weight zipper bag. Pour marinade mixture into bag. Close bag and massage chicken so that all pieces are well coated with marinade. Refrigerate chicken in bag overnight.

#To cook

Remove chicken from marinade and place in a 4-quart slow cooker. Discard marinade. Cook on low setting for 3 hours, until chicken has cooked through but is not falling off the bone.

Preheat a gas grill to medium-hot, about 450F. Sear chicken for 2 minutes per side.

#To serve

Serve with steamed white rice or boiled fingerling potatoes.

----

*Jerk chicken usually calls for Scotch bonnet pepper, or the similar habanero. These are the hottest peppers in the capsicum family. I have lightened the spice in this recipe by using jalapeos, which are much milder. If you want to authenticate this recipe and love hot, hot, hot, substitute one scotch bonnet pepper for the jalapeos.*

 That can be a good argument by itself, but still, the context is grammatical in nature. 

 I paved a road, you created a business (pause) you didn't build **that**.

The question is what *that* refers to. The road or the business? If it's the business, then we can argue your point (can the carpenter claim he built the house?) but if *that* refers to the road, then there isn't any argument, because that statement is true. You didn't build the road, the government did, and you (maybe) paid taxes. 

Should have used **those**. 




 The irony is that he's using a made up story to convey a message against made up stories used to convey messages.

   survivors guilt could have easily convinced her that she 'must have known'

According to her statement, unless her memory made that up also, her father straight up told her what he's doing:

 He told me he killed girls.  
Again and again.  
So he wouldn't have to kill me.

Overall, when I rewatched season 1, I noticed that Abigail is portrayed (hinted) to be clever, distant, borderline sociopath and definitely hiding something (as Alana told Jack after first meeting her). I think this also explains why Hannibal was drawn to her so much. He knew what she's capable of. 

I think that the trauma made her forget the role the she played and the stuff she knew, but as the season progressed she became more self aware.

 I would have agreed with you, up until the final episode of the second season. [spoiler](#s "Gutting Will, arguably his best friend. Killed Abigail, which he seen like a daughter, in front of Will, which also loved her like his daughter. Stepped over Alana without even looking down, in which he had an affair for an entire season."). We usually see Villains do crazy shit to people they don't know, but this is really intimate level of evil.  




 Breaking Bad isn't *that* good. It's good entertainment, but I wouldn't put it in the best shows ever list. It's too calculated, too self aware and runs a very narrow story. 




 When he started the Tobacco topic, my first thought was "that's a beaten down topic, I mean, we all know the shit Tobacco companies pulled over the years". He then took it to an interesting place with nice angles I wasn't aware of (plain package, suing the governments, Africa). Well done. And the last bit with Jeff was brilliant.

 'Weapons dealer' doesn't mean much unless he consistently and knowingly sells weapons to bad people. Does he? (Asking because I don't know) 




 Of course not, don't get me wrong. Those aren't excuses at all. Those issues are the test, and it's obvious to me the US is failing most the tests it's facing. My point is that some countries almost aren't tested, and therefore shouldn't be scored, at least not on the same scale (and that's a good thing for them, really). 




 Could be, but then again, what are the challenges facing the press in Malta? Freedom of press is tested when the government has things to hide from the people. Wars, espionage, political scandals, unlawful conducts, corruption, riots and so on. Does Malta face any of that? (I'm asking out of ignorance) 




 People who are claiming short selling is unethical simply don't understand how the market works and what motivates the players.

1. You are saying that short selling "promotes the spreading of false information". Here's the thing, short seller are the only players - ONLY PLAYERS - with a motivation to spread bad news. Companies, long holders, brokers, stock exchange, politicians - all care about good news. All want to sugar coat everything. All want the stock market in all time high day in day out, as long as the inevitable fall won't happen while they hold the potato.   
Short seller play a huge roll in unearthing information.

2. Short sellers also stop down trends. They have an incentive to book profit. During panics, they are a major force that actually buy stocks (to cover). Short sellers only profit when they are back in the market as buyers (as oppose to long holders who hold assets and not necessarily have to sell to realize profits).

3. Short selling ban isn't effective. It was stated even by the fed: [Short-Selling Bans Failed to Prevent U.S. Stock Price Declines - Federal Reserve Bank of New York](http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2012/rp120810.html).

4. Short selling plays a huge roll in arbitrage trading and forcing many financial instruments to behave as they should. For example, the reason ETFs are trading close to the indices they follow is because of short selling. If a certain ETF opens a gap from its index, arbitrage players long one and short the other. Because of that mechanism, regular retail investors can buy ETFs without worrying too much.

 Alright, alright, alright 









 Well, they did mention that a big part of the feud was because of an incident between Dickie and Raylan when they were children. Raylan hit Dickie's knee with a baseball bat leaving him with a lame leg. So it's only fair that he shot his other leg when they grew up. Classic Raylan.

I don't think they tell what started it back in the prohibition era. 














 I agree with you, but you also need to consider that private charity will probably be more effective and more competitive. Still, not going to happen.  




  They just chat to dead characters who spew vague bullshit that rarely affects the narrative.

That's my main issue with hallucination scenes. I don't hate them, but they are so fucking predictable and boring. 

The hallucination is the Sopranos, after Tony was shot (season 6), was nicely done. It also lasted few episodes and had the right mix of nonsense and coherent plot.  




  They don't care, as long as production costs aren't incredibly high

The cost is only half of the equation. HBO cares about subscriptions. Their question is: does this show net generate or net eliminate subs? ratings, while giving some indication, don't answer that question. So in that sense, they don't care about them.  




 I also like to point out that numbers don't mean much without the overall trend (if homicide rate is [in decline for 2.5 decades](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Number_of_murders_by_year_in_Chicago.png), then permits got nothing to do with that).

I guess infographic with arrows is catchy, but the questions should be: was the trend accelerated? was it reversed? are there other factors in play around the same time? did it stay the same *despite* other counter-factors? and so on. 

It's hard and almost impossible to isolate specific variables in large social systems like crime or economy.

 There's a reason for that. If you are a stranger in a strange land, you often feel strongly the illusion of freedom. Especially if you have money. It's easy to live when you are off the grid, ignored by the day-to-day burdens like taxes, health insurance, career choices, family, kids.

Edit: another thing I'd like to add is that in free countries we feel unfree mostly because of what we hear by the media. See news and browse the internet looking for freedom, and you'll feel oppressed and depressed within a week. The flip side of it is when you travel to another country and you simply don't know what's going on around you. The dude is visiting China, one of the largest countries in the world with 1.5 Billion people, he's amazed of all the new things he learned, where in fact, it's like going to a safari in Africa, standing by the entrance and say: this is bullshit, there aren't any lions here, why people are so afraid?

 I think that people aren't looking for scores. They are looking for recommendations, which don't necessarily have to come in a form of a number.  




 I'm afraid you misunderstood me. I'm not saying checks and balances are a good thing. And I'm not saying courts are needed. 

I'm talking about the definition of democratic. And if courts sit within that definition. 

Democracy, is a form of ruling in which the people chooses representatives every once in a while, and those representatives rule the people. That's not my definition. That's the scholar definition. And a very narrow one. So we can work with that. If you go by the even narrower definition of "rule of the people", then obviously even a parliamentary system isn't democratic. That's fine, but we should work off the same base.

Some democracies are direct. People actually vote on laws. Some of the democracies are of indirect form: representatives make laws. Some of the democracies have few degrees: representatives pick other representatives. For example, the people votes for parties, the parties form a government with a prime minister. The people didn't vote directly for the prime minister, but they trust their elected to do so.

Still, all those forms fall within the scholar definition of democracy (again, not my definition, that's really not that interesting).

What I'm saying is that courts are an extension of that process. Same as the police. I elect someone, that person appoints chief of police (so by proxy, it's like I made that appointment), that chief of police goes back and arrests the person who elected him - **because that's what I, the people, want**. All still working within the democratic framework. 

Court is like the central bank or the FDA or the military or sub-committees - all extensions of the government and, by the democratic process, of the people. The fact that its power is used as a balance is irrelevant. So that's where you missed my point.

If, for example, the supreme court was going from father to son, or was a private company with no obligation to the general public. I would have agreed with you - it's undemocratic. If a constitution is irreversible and cannot be amended - it's undemocratic. If the king or queen has any role, it's undemocratic. 

Also, just to add something real quick: the fact that in some countries, high courts are appointed to life, is obviously undemocratic.  




  Courts being able overturn legislation is by the definition of most scholars technically undemocratic.

I'm not sure about that. First, in many cases courts are appointed/approved by the an elected officials (or their representatives), so they are democratic by proxy. Second, courts interpret the law, which was also written by elected officials. They don't make up new laws. So that's again democratic. Third, they find contradictions between the law and the constitution. Meaning, they make sure the legislative branch is operating within the boundaries of the law (you can't rob someone, they can't make laws that contradict other laws).

There can be some exceptions here and there (just like a president or prime minister overusing executive power), but the overall structure is still inherently democratic.

 Okay, it's kind of a weird one. The husband is a high level manager in a weapon technology company. He and his wife relocated to Singapore for a couple of years to be his company's representative in the east. They lived really well over there. Just few months in, his wife got into coma. I really don't know the exact circumstances of that. She was treated there and he decided to stay (instead of moving back with her to his home country). He was able to get her mom a visa and flew her there also. 

A little more than a year passed, probably the longest year in his life,  and she woke up. After 1-2 weeks in the hospital (physical therapy, checks and such)  she was released. However, she was completely different person.

She started getting into mystical stuff, Buddhism, crystals, connection with the after life, tarot reading. She started playing guitar.

None of the things she had mattered to her. She hated the luxury apartment building they lived in, hated that she had a chauffeur and a maid, hated money and hated her husband's job. 

It's not like she was ungrateful or resentful. She was simply different. Anyway, that's how he described it. He loved her deeply, but it's like they had nothing in common. Almost felt like an arranged marriage. 

I met her couple of years ago (which was about 5 years after she left him) and she was nice, but very hard to talk to. She seemed detached a little bit. Still into that mystical stuff (I guess, because she mentioned something about my aura).

I don't know what happened to her while she was in a coma, and I don't know if other people react like that and how commom this is. But I guess it can change a person.  




 X post to /r/crappydesign. 




 Yeah, in Hollywood films the men always have courage when women are involved. I guess they were trying to show something different. 









  you name it, she will have it

Also, there's no guarantee she'll even want to be in a relationship after she wakes up. I know someone who woke up after a year of coma, and few months after divorced her husband. She wad changed, and needed time to find herself again. 

If she'll be in the same situation (who knows), OP will feel betrayed. It will crush him. But then again, you can't really blame her for that.

 Yes, I'm with you here. Besides, telling anything meaningful to anybody you don't know, is mostly stupid. 




 Yes, but to be fair, OP didn't say: "I don't have money, so I'm not going to spend it on entertainment" (which is a valid statement, regardless of the money you have or the cost). He said: "I'm broke... next month for sure!", meaning he wants to spend $5 on something like that, but he can't do it right now. That's a very fragile situation to be in, and one should probably try to change it as much as they can.

 Re Ponzi scheme. First I wouldn't call it a scheme. It's perfectly clear what's going on, and nobody is trying to deceive or sell a malfunction product here. 

Second, it does rely on a constant stream of paying people to support the previously paying people. Same way as an insurance company client who is depended on other clients, or the company won't have enough to pay him when needed.

Now, we don't need anybody to stop paying taxes, that's an extreme scenario. But what if life expectancy goes higher (without enhanced quality), meaning people will stop working at 70 but will live until 140? That's not far fetched, and it's actually the current trend. Or what if less people will decide to have children while immigration is staying low? Japan is facing that problem.

 Of course, you are right. So the problem is shareholders aren't doing their job and rubber stamp other people's decisions. That needs to be changed. 

About institutional investors. This is only partially correct. The majority holders at large firms are institutional. But those are mostly mutual funds (Vanguard, Fidelity and such). The investors in those funds get to vote, and they even get periodically proxy vote by mail. If they ignore it, the fund will vote for them.

Anyway, saying that CEO get high compensation because of some committee is really putting the blame on the least significant part of the entire process.  




 Google is a growing company. Their 25+ PE indicates investors also perceive it that way. They expect the company to grow and invest in opportunities as it see fits, and they are willing to pay a premium for that chance. Paying dividends will send the opposite signal and will probably crash the stock price on the long term.  




  CEO compensation committee

I'm sorry but no committee is determining the CEO compensation. The committee, if exists - not all companies have it - is part of the board of directors and simply recommends the best salary they see fit. The board is the one that decides and approves compensations.

The board is also directly assigned by the shareholders. And many times CEO compensation goes to a vote by the shareholders.  Also, in some countries there's "say on pay" corporate laws, which means that even if the board made a salary decision without shareholders vote, they (the shareholders) are entitled to call the compensation to a vote and change it.

TL;DR instead of blaming the board is we should blame (the far being CEOs) shareholder.

3. You can't whitelist sites (for example, you can't enable ads on Reddit).
4. It won't work if the ad is hosted on a legitimate domain.

 You get interest from the broker, depends on the agreement you have with it (which is the borrowing costs the short seller is paying for the privilege to sell a stock that he didn't buy).

Also keep in mind that some brokers won't even tell you they are lending your stocks to someone else. I'm not sure if they are obligated to inform you or even pay you.

 Okay, so that's a different point: no culture is really explored. Maybe that's right, I don't claim to support or oppose it. Western culture are familiar to the world (not just to western players), so it's hard to draw the line on where the exploration begins and when the knowing just exists. 

For example, I'm playing now Dragon Age: Inquisition. Knights Templar, Chantry, and other similar terms are all from the western christian history. They need little exploration, because they are known. If they used terms from the Yoruba religion, they would have needed much more exploration and explanation. 

Other games have hundreds of references to American culture (language, media, style, technology, appearance). The nuances are built in.

 Too many Cooks.

 Here's the my method of cooking a perfect rice in a pot. It works every time. For me, it always tastes better than rice cooker. So give it a try:

1. Heat 1 spoon of olive oil in a pot with tight lid
2. Boil water in a separate pot (or use water boiler)
3. Add 1 chopped onion to the heated oil. Saute until soft and transparent.
4. Add 1 cup of rice to the pot. Stir it so it will all be covered in oil. about 2-3 minutes. This will prevent the rice from sticking, and it also hardens it a little.
5. At this point your water should be boiled and ready.
6. Add 1.75 cups of boiled water. Add another cup for extra cups of rice you used (so if you cooked 2 cups of rice, that would be 2.75 cups of water).
7. Stir just a little, make sure the water is boiling again and reduce the heat to a simmer (pretty much the minimal heat).
8. Let it cook for 20 minutes, don't touch it.
9. After 20 minutes, the onion should be on top of the rice and no water left in the pot. Uncover, stir gently with a fork, let it rest for 10 minutes.
10. That's it.

Now, the time of the cooking and the water ratio varies. It depends on the type of rice (short, medium or long grain, where it came from, etc.). So the best practice is to try on your favorite type and adjust the time and the water until you get a perfect result for your taste.

 I suggest that you saute the onions first in a skillet. That will greatly improve the flavor.

If you have enough time and don't want to use skillet, you can slowcook them for several hours before starting your dish. Or, the best option, slowcook large batch on onions (6-8) with some olive oil for 8 hours on low, then divide to 4 portions and freeze. Whenever a recipe calls for onions, add it from the freezer (no need to thaw).

  How is this any different?

Because food, cloths and entertainment aren't preserved as morally equal. I'm not saying those game farms are wrong or immoral, but I can see how it's on the far side of the scale.

Also, breeding animals for food (and the questionable living conditions and slaughtering techniques) is one of the major factors of lifting people above poverty and hunger levels. Many people simply couldn't afford meat if it wasn't delivered like that. While zoos and entertainment farms mostly serve the rich. So I think that point also add to the differences between them.

Anyway, at least those animals get a chance to escape their hunters, put up a fight and die in nature.

 I adopted the recipe from [here]( http://www.myrecipes.com/m/recipe/black-bean-squash-chili).  
The only challenge is to peel the squash, but other than that, easy and tasty. I also added celery and stirred all the spices in the skillet together with the peppers, I think it brings up more flavors.
 
#Ingredients

* 1/4 cup olive oil 
* 3 onions, chopped 
* 4 cloves garlic, minced 
* 1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped 
* 1 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped 
* 2 jalapeos, seeded and minced 
* 4 15-oz. cans black beans, rinsed and drained 
* 2 14.5-oz. cans diced fire-roasted tomatoes 
* 3 tablespoons chili powder 
* 2 tablespoons cumin 
* 1 tablespoon dried oregano 
* 4 cups butternut squash (about 2 lb.), peeled, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch dice 
* Salt and pepper 

#Preparation

1. Warm oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saut onions until tender, about 3 minutes. Add garlic; saut 1 minute. Add bell peppers and jalapeos; saut until tender, about 3 minutes.
2. Transfer pepper mixture to slow cooker. Stir in beans, tomatoes, chili powder, cumin and oregano. Arrange squash on top. Cover and cook on low for 6 hours.

#Cooking the rice

In a pot heat 2 tablespoons of oil, add 1 cup of rice and stir to have it all covered. After 2 minutes add boiling water or chicken broth if you prefer more flavorful rice, bring to boil again and let it cook for 10 minutes on low burner. After that, remove from the heat and set it aside undisturbed for another 10 minutes.
 









 Not only cultural but practical. Dogs don't have enough meat, it's not that tasty (lean and hard), it's expensive to feed them and some can be useful through their entire life.  




 Yeah, but don't forget that insurance in mandatory by law in most areas of the world. So it will take time until they'll feel pressure to lower rates. In fact, they are in for some good years with same premiums but less accidents.  




 I wouldn't go far and calling it a scam. There are some unique (and shady) characteristic in the industry:

* It's one of the few industries in which you pay, sometimes years, before you get the service with a chance that you might never actually get it. The company gets to keep the money (and invest it) without actually putting it to work towards the product.
* The standard procedure to get the service you paid for is to sue (either you sue the insurance company or they sue another company).
* It's one of the few industries in which the most important department is the legal department.
* There are lots of scams against insurance companies. It's probably the biggest victim of customers' theft.
* There's an information gap in a sense that the customer usually knows more about the product than the seller (typically it's the other way around).
* Some of the services are mandatory by law. 




 Yeah, HTPC users wouldn't mind, but the fact that it won't be available is seems on Android tablets (I use mine to watch netflix occasionally) and chromecast sucks. At least at the beginning anyway. 




 It says PC is okay. So HTPC users wouldn't mind. But still, blocking it out from Android tablets, consoles, chromecast is risky as hell. I guess not only that Apple paid a lot, but also HBO is very confident to launch in a narrow market. 




 It's a brave decision in the wrong sense of the word. PC is fine, so those with HTPC wouldn't mind. They got the price right, $14.99.  









 Not the same. Most of the aid to Israel is annual military funds, which Israel has to spend on American products. It's basically a corporate welfare. 

China's debt are USA government bonds held by the Chinese government.

Both of those amounts aren't that significant relative to the 100% (USA total aid, USA total budget, USA total debt, Israel budget, China total assets, you name it), but they make good headlines.

 I'd like to add, in addition to response you got from /u/dragontamer5788, that if you do want to use leverage, it's better to leverage the entire account. Meaning, if you hold $10K in double leverage ETF, it's better to hold $20K in the underlying ETF and use half of it as leverage from the broker. 

Margin rates are extremely low now and you won't suffer from beta decay that was explained to you.

Overall, leverage ETFs are bad for long time holding periods. The last few years weren't a good example because the market didn't suffer a lot of volatility, but don't think this condition will last forever nor will you able to know in time when it changes. 









 3 points to think about: 1. Did you shift gears fully? Sometimes half shift causes noise. 2. Are you cross chaining (small ring to small ring or big ring to big ring)? That also can cause some noise. 3. If not half shift and not cross chaining, go to LBS to adjust the gears or do it at home if you have the tools. 




 Yeah, you are right, this is by no means accurate, just something to know as a general guidance. The link between training, calories and weight loss is also non linear. Meaning, training and eating to lose the 100th kg is different than the 70th kg.

 Two options: either use [GPS](http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/us/en/gps) with dedicated software or use an app if you have smartphone. Popular apps are [Strava](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.strava hl=en), [Endomondo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.endomondo.android), [Map My Ride](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapmyride.android2). The advantage of apps are social (even if you don't like sharing stuff with friends, you can browse and discover lots of routes), nice websites and no need for another device to buy and carry. The disadvantage is that you depend on your phone and its battery. Unlike GPS devices, it probably won't last 5-6 hours unless it's new or you carry an extra portable charger.

If you want to make a bet, then Strava and Endomondo are really good for it, because you can actually challenge your friends and you can see the progress.
 




 From 2009, interview with Larry King:

 **MAHER**: Well, we've talked about it. I'm not into western medicine. That to me is a complete scare tactic. It just shows you, you can...

 **KING**: You mean you don't get a -- you don't get a flu shot?

 **MAHER**: A flu shot is the worst thing you can do.

 **KING**: Why? MAHER: Because it's got -- it's got mercury.

 **KING**: It prevents flu.

 **MAHER**: It doesn't prevent. First of all, that's...

 **KING**: I haven't had the flu in 25 years since I've been taking a flu shot.

 **MAHER**: Well, I hate to tell you, Larry, but if you have a flu shot for more than five years in a row, there's ten times the likelihood that you'll get Alzheimer's disease. I would stop getting your...

 **KING**: What did you say?

 **MAHER**: That went better in rehearsal but it was still good. Absolutely, no the defense against disease is to have a strong immune system. A flu shot just compromises your immune system.

 **KING**: So you don't take any western medicine, don't take an aspirin?

 **MAHER**: Never, an aspirin no. Thousands of people die from aspirin every year.

I also think that western medicine and health practice does a lot of things wrong, but flu vax isn't one of them. He's being stupid here.
 




 I don't know, I think they went too hard on it using all the practices we all hate about business: lobbying, campaigning, lots of money.

I don't think GMO should be labeled, but I also don't see too much harm in it. Especially if virtually all food products will be labeled. It can be like ingredients. Salt isn't bad, but it's still written on the label. If someone wants to control their salt diet, he pays attention while most people don't give a fuck about that.

It's already labeled around the world in the EU and most of the developed countries. [EU: Traceability and labelling of GMOs](http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/environment/nature_and_biodiversity/l21170_en.htm). 




 Good job man. I say keep track of your nutrition. 

Since you like riding long distances and also, if I get it correctly, want to lose weight, it's important to balance your diet. Consuming too little calories while training will increase the chances of fatigue and illness. 

At your pace (20 km/h), you'll burn about 8 calories per kg per hour. So if you weight 80kg and ride 4 hours, that would be 8x80x4 = 2,560 cal. If you want to lose weight, consume 20% less, so about 500 cal less. But try not to get less than that, so you can keep healthy.

If you want to lose half a kilo per week (which is what considered an healthy diet), you would need to consume 3,500 calories less than you burn over the course of the **week**.

Obviously those numbers are just for guidelines and it depends on a lot of other factors. It can still give you general estimation. 




 /r/rage! 




 I think it backfires when those companies fight to not write GMO on the label. People don't trust businesses who try to hide things. So anti-big-businesses stand will be to immediately question GMO. This is, more than anything, a pavlovian response. 




 He's not 100% anti vax. He said he's anti the flu shot. He also brings some arguments about the downside of vax. However, you are still right, his argument aren't really backed by science.

I think his anti vax position is the same as others so-called rich liberal hippies, who used to think it's cool and healthy, only to wake up one morning and see who else support their ideas. At this point it's just a matter of time until they find a ladder to climb down from their stupid tree. 




 Nah, he withdrew that statement. He said he was libertarian when they were the only politicians that talked about weeds. 

He does agree on a lot if things with Ron Paul, mostly drugs and foreign policy. So when he mentions his name he also says that.

 Damn seeing people and their privileges.  




 You are right, I wasn't clear enough and I probably used the wrong terminology out of a hurry. Allow me to clarify.

**Economic efficiency**

If you were a young musician living in rural Wisconsin, it was almost impossible for you to get young listeners in Cleveland, Belgium, Australia, Hong Kong or Slovakia to hear your music and pay for it.

There were too many gates and too few competitive gate keepers between the artists and the consumer.

Therefor supply couldn't meet the real demand. And because of that, all the process in the middle and all the prices and compensations were distorted. 

(The other way around, from Australia, Hong Kong, Slovakia, Belgium **to** USA, was almost non existent). 

First you had to find a record company. Why? because printing vinyl records or compact disks is damn expensive. Distributing them is also expensive. Distributing where? to physical music stores, which also didn't exist abundantly in some markets or were under monopoly in other markets. Those stores also had limited space. How would the consumer even hear your music? The only option was radio and TV. In most of the world there were at best 2-3 variety channels, so the time you had to listen to **your** kind of music was probably 2-3 hours a week (This Top of the Pops and Radio1 in Britain, other places were even worst), that's it. So in the process you had to pass a Label, which held most of the power over you, then radio channel editor and a store manager with limited space. 

That means that everything in the middle: recording, printing, distrusting, art, stores, radio and TV - all were able to manipulate prices, not based on the music, but based on inefficient market conditions.

The market for independent musicians, those who complain today about high fees from iTunes, Google or Spotify, simply didn't exist (or was very minor) just 2 decades back.

By the way, even very successful artists would have killed for 30% flat fee on their sales. Out of $10 LP or $15 CD, artists [received $2 at best](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100712/23482610186.shtml). Only today you have an option to independently save up $25,000 (it's expensive, but competitive and not unheard of amount), record your first album, mix the music on your computer, put it on youtube, spotify, soundcould, bandcamp, itunes, and earn net 70% of the sales. A direct connection between you and the listener. Almost no gates and no gate keepers. So you get very closely to what you worth in the world. 




 2 points about your quotes and 1 hard truth.

1. The artist says: shirt? No thanks. But he doesn't give any reason for that. Is selling a shirt too low for him? When it comes to music, merchandise are a way for fans to express their love and connection with the music. It's a service to fans, and one that pays back.

2. 'Apple charging 30% and not taking any risks'. That's false. Apple took huge risks in the past to get to this point today. They invested large amount of money in platform and devices way before they were common and far from being a safe bet. Technology works in a way that first you take all the risks, then, if you are one of the very few successful survivors, you get big profit and big margins. 

And to the hard truth: making music isn't that special. There are tons of good artists, they all have access now to mass audience, so the competition is tough.

There's really no reason to pay for something that exists abundantly. The old market wasn't efficient because record companies created artificial scarcity.  

If you are a small band, and you make good music, you are offering something that is offered by thousands more. Why would someone pay you premium for that, when the limited resource here is the time to listen to all the good music available. 




 My experience with ETS2: played for hours, drove between all cities, explored most roads. Still can't reverse park a truck. 




 How about Moneyball?

http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1301.Moneyball

*Billy Beane, general manager of MLB's Oakland A's and protagonist of Michael Lewis'sMoneyball, had a problem: how to win in the Major Leagues with a budget that's smaller than that of nearly every other team. Conventional wisdom long held that big name, highly athletic hitters and young pitchers with rocket arms were the ticket to success. But Beane and his staff, buoyed by massive amounts of carefully interpreted statistical data, believed that wins could be had by more affordable methods such as hitters with high on-base percentage and pitchers who get lots of ground outs. Given this information and a tight budget, Beane defied tradition and his own scouting department to build winning teams of young affordable players and inexpensive castoff veterans.*

  I find it very helpful to avoid repetition.

But here's the thing. If you find yourself repeating, then there's something in the structure of your writing that needs changing. And if you still think that structure is fine and repeating is unavoidable, then it's important enough to keep using the same word or it will be just confusing.

  It's basically the same as producing 3 feature films

Probably not. As much as those episodes have high production value compared to TV, it's still not close to a film. For example, the budget of The Imitation Game was about $15M. I doubt the budget for each episode is more than $2M. I bet that post takes much less time than a film, but I couldn't find any sources to back that up.

The answer has to be with the schedule of Cumberbatch   Freeman, both very busy and popular at the moment. I'm sure Hollywood pays more than the BBC and also provides more opportunities, so we can't really blame them for their priorities.

 Cereal bars usually aren't good enough because it takes time for them to digest and deliver calories to your body. Fruits and drinks are quicker and more efficient in that regard.

Overall, you should aim to consume about 150-200 calories per hour, depending on your pace. 1 banana will give you about 120 cal.

If you want to eat something more solid, like a sandwich (PB J will give you about 200 cal, depending on the bread), do it as part of a full 20-30 minutes stop.

**Basic recipe for home made drink**: mix 1/3 cup of your favorite juice (orange, apple, cranberry and such), 4 tablespoon of sugar (should be around 60g), 1/4 teaspoon of salt with water to fill up 1L. That should give you around 250 calories per Liter, which is the recommended amount.

 I play two games that have something that might be overkill, and they both have the same mechanics. In Dragon Age: Inquisition there are Focus skills and in Path of Exile there are Vaal skills. In both games you basically need to kill enemies to charge those skills (in DA:I the more you kill, the more powerful the skill becomes, up to 3 stages). When the skill is charged you can use it once, and needs to recharge it again. 

Overall I think it's a good mechanic that add some depth and tactic to the game. POE is ARPG so the skill get charged quickly, but in DA:I you need to be a bit more calculated if you want it available to a boss fight. 




 God damn it. 




 /r/lewronggeneration might also like it. 




 I think you miss the point a little. Of course he can do it. But it's more risky. Meaning, if he does it a 100 different times, he'll fall 1-2 times and lose the stage. Hell, some of them even fall in roundabouts. Don't they know how to make a simple circle? of course they do, but it's more risky. So the question is: Is sidewalk hopping a good practice from risk/reward perspective?  









 Overdone. 




 This is why I liked living in a busy street in NYC. The UPS truck arrived around the same time every day, parked in the same spot, and it took them about 20-30 minutes to deliver all the packages. So I had plenty of time to just approach the truck with the slip they left on the door (of the building!) and get my stuff. 




 Thanks. I thought it was certain that carbon frame can't be held by the frame. When I bought my car roof mount I was also told that by the seller. 




 Sarah Silverman is one of the best things that happened to comedy in the past decade.  




 Correct. That's why [countries with dictatorship](http://www.ranker.com/list/countries-ruled-by-dictatorship/reference), in which people don't value democracy and personal freedom, are ranked at the top of every category and basically live a rich, happy and worry-free life.
