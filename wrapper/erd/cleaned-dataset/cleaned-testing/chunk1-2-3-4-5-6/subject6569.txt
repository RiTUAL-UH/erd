 I would recommend that links to the actual leaks here not be included. Discussion is what is really desired (at least for me), but the links allow them grounds to delete the links in their subs to this one. Anyone can do a google search and find them quite easily without too much instruction.

I agree 100%. 




 The response I posted in the other thread:

I do understand the sentiment even though I suspect it's a bit hypocritical. I doubt that out of all of the mods over at /r/gameofthrones, none has watched the leaked episodes... Well, it's a moot point.


I guess there's just one thing to do:**Whenever you see anyone over in /r/gameofthrones (or any other sub) ask about a place to discuss the leaked episodes, send them a PM to inform them of this subreddit.**


That way only people *overtly* looking for a discussion are told of this place and the mods over at /r/gameofthrones can rest assured that this sub is only "advertised" to people who want to take part in the discussion.

 Yeah, me too... 




 Do that. 

I understand and respect their decision to not allow any discussion of the leaked episodes on /r/gameofthrones but at the same I would like them to acknowledge that people *will* watch them and *will* want to discuss them afterwards, to pretend anything else would be naive. 

Why not give viewers a sub where they can do just that? It would drastically cut down on spoilers in /r/gameofthrones and it would give subscribers a clear decision: Want to watch the leaked episodes and discuss them afterwards? Head over to /r/piratesofthrones. Want to watch the episodes as they air and remain spoiler-free? Stay in /r/gameofthrones! 




 By the same logic they could ban ASOIAF wikis. I don't think they should have to keep their subscribers safe from spoilers *outside of their own sub*... 




 Some one mentioned /r/piratesofthrones in a comment in the "Episode leaks, Spoilers and Piracy" sticky thread.

I responded to them with this:

I wouldn't be surprised if your post were deleted - it's what happened to the only other post I saw mentioning another such subreddit.
I would be interested in the mods' reasoning behind this. I understand and support their decision to keep /r/gameofthrones as spoiler-free as possible but it seems like sending people to another sub for the discussion of the leaked episodes could only help that goal!

A couple of minutes later both our posts had been deleted. No explanation by the mods. The only explanation I can come up with is that the mod team doesn't want people to fuck off to other subs but that would be incredibly petty...

Thoughts? 




 Right you are. Thanks for refreshing my memory! 




 It's been so very long since I read the books so I'd appreciate it if someone could refresh my memory:

Is that how Mance dies in the books? This scene seemed very unfamiliar to me. Also, it seems like they completely changed Tyrion's story line or am I remembering that wrong? Was Varys with him in the books?

 I agree - sex is an important aspect of a romantic relationship and you're not helping anyone by staying in a relationship with someone who won't/can't fulfill you sexually.  




 Good idea, a separate subreddit will help keep /r/GameOfThrones as spoiler-free as possible!

Upvoted for visibility. 




 Serious question:

I understand that the uploader blurred the watermark but wouldn't HBO alter something (e.g. a tiny blip in a random frame) unique to each screener so that if it leaks they could find the guilty party? 
























 Something along the lines of "Well, you're sitting here, matching each of my replies with one of your one so who's the shitdick living in mum's trailer?"

Hence my comment. 




 By the logic you just invoked... both of you? 




 Well ain't you just the cutest little thing?

**EDIT:**
Aww, don't you wanna play anymore? It was just getting fun!

Well, goodbye /u/mrjewels and best of luck with med school! 




 Oh. I, too, will get older. Eventually I'll die.

I just got that.  




 How so? 

Human interest news has nothing to do with Buzzfeed in itself, it's simply a basic staple of journalism. You might as well say that newspapers are the buzzfeed for people over 40...  




 You can answer a call. 

You can answer the door.

You can answer to your name.

You can answer to a description.

I'm sure there are more options but after thinking about the word for so long it has lost all meaning and is just a weird jumble of letters and sounds, A phenomenon which, by the way, is called [semantic satiation.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_satiation)

 




 So, wait, you *didn't* buy it?! 




 I... what? 




 It's an opinion piece from the National Review and it's terribly inaccurate. What this piece of drivel is doing in /r/nottheonion I'll never understand... 




 We're here. That was quick. 




 I felt like Veep got over that phase after season 1. Regardless, I think the Veep people are the best ensemble cast currently on TV, maybe the best since season 3 of Arrested Development.

The way they play off of each other is unmatched by anything on TV right now! 




 Wow, talk about petty... 




 Anyone else pleasantly surprised that Daenerys actually listened to Barristan Selmy? 
























 Yeah, but the show has already deviated from the books (and I expect this to get even more pronounced as Season 5 develops). Ain't no going back now.  




  the therapist would have to report you to authorities

If that's true then it's terrifying - and infuriating, because such a law would keep many pedophiles from seeking help, thus directly endangering children! 




 I agree. I don't believe that he can be faulted for having such desires (after all, you don't get to choose your sexuality) but his unwillingness to seek help for it is a red flag for me. If you have pedophilic tendencies you represent a danger to other people, no matter how well you think you have it "under control".   




 Well ain't you just a ray of ~~thinly veiled rage issues~~ sunshine.  




 Speaking as a European (from a country that is basically being worshipped by U.S. pro-gun people, mostly for inaccurate reasons) if limited magazine size is your biggest gripe with a candidate for the presidency you oughta be jumping for joy... 




 I just downloaded his thesis and flipped through it, curious about the writing style. The first thing I noticed? The dedication:

In the hopes that this work may in some way contribute
to their exploration of space, this is dedicated to the crew
members of this country' s present and future manned space
programs. If only I could join them in their exciting endeavors.


Made my day!

 




 Where did she say that?

She was talking about 23 year old men who *pursue sexual relationships with underage girls*, not all 23 year old men. That's a pretty big difference! 




 You can resign from the council. Voila! 




 What's safe or unsafe about any of us? Are you asking because you think that white men *specifically* are less 'unsafe' than other groups of the population or because you don't understand / disagree with the concept of a safe space?

I'll give you an example: Twice a month me and a whole bunch of my male friends get together for an evening - no women allowed. Activities differ - we might go for a hike or play some b-ball or go see a movie or have ourselves a good, old-fashioned N64 multiplayer-party. Usually there's copious amounts of drinking involved as well. We always have a great time.

And always, at some point in the evening, we start talking for real. Discussions that we can't have (or can't have in that way) with our girlfriends (and in the case of two of my mates, boyfriends). We talk about issues in our relationships, our careers, our physical and mental health and we all get a lot out of these talks. Because sometimes it's just nice to get some feedback on your issues from people who have similar experiences without having your partners involved.

That's an example of a safe space. Don't you see the value in that?  




 Yeah, I gotta agree. 

Hey i made as many as of you hosts so please invite loads of BME women and non-binary people!!

Also if you've been invited and you're a man and/or white PLEASE DON'T COME just cos I invited a bunch of people and hope you will be responsible enough to respect this is a BME Women and non-binary event only... Don't worry lads we will give you and allies things to do ;-)

I think that post is silly but I also think the word "ban" is hyperbole. Safe spaces can be useful tools - just think of women's or men's shelters, support groups for addictions or illnesses(Damn you Marla Singer)).  




 I remember reading research about incidences of anorexia suddenly sky-rocketing in developing countries when their TV stations started broadcasting western programming (I want to say sitcoms but I'm not sure) for the first time that depicted thinness as an attractive trait. If you're interested I can try and find it as soon as I'm not on mobile anymore.

In general I think that people who don't believe that we're influenced by the media are the same sort of people who claim that "ads don't work" on them...

 




 Have you ever heard Hitler use his "normal" voice? [It's a pretty interesting difference!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClR9tcpKZec)

 It's been a while since I read the book, is Jon established as definitely having died? I remember him being mob-stabbed but I can't remember at what point the narrative cuts off. 




 I expect there to be some more hints about Jon's true parentage! 




 As long as you have decency and gumption you're a-ok! 




 I've encountered a lot of scholars of religions in my philosophy seminars and they were bright and interesting people to a man (and woman, of course). Anyone who can wrestle with Thomas Aquinas and come out the other side in one piece deserves a great amount of respect in my mind. 

I worked as a bartender and bouncer through my undergrad, not quite the same as a barista, I know, but similar in some ways... just with more drunk people. 

Once you have your masters, depending on whether your church offers this opportunity - why not go and travel to the farthest reaches of your faith's influence and work in a congregation there? I knew a young catholic priest once who worked in McMurdo station in Antarctica for a year. I always envied him because of this.  




  I haven't really felt anything for anyone since we broke up, not even sympathy or emphathy. Just..kind of...a heart of stone.

I've experienced that a couple of times. It sucks. I would tell you that it will pass but I know from experience how unhelpful such comments feel - when you're in a bad spot you don't want your experience to be downplayed as a 'passing phase', no matter whether it's true. What I will say is that, in time, this episode will help you understand things about yourself you didn't previously. 

Relationships ending is tough, especially if it's the first serious one but it will help you figure out some stuff. It's a learning experience, as cruel as that may sound right now.

As for the college stuff - don't be so quick to dismiss the skills you've learned with your degree - most of what you've done in the last 4 (I'm guessing) years can be marketed as skills, if you know how. I have a degree in liberal arts and there were times I was freaking out about my future prospects. I run a production company now, it's doing very well. And as ludicrous as it may sound, the skills I learned in getting my degrees in creative writing and comparative lit. are paying huge dividends. Like, six-figure dividends.

Figure out your passions (another throwaway encouragement prompting a lot of eye-rolling) and then figure out how to link them to your degree and then figure out how to make a career out of that. It's easier than you might think.

Good luck with everything, /u/Gordo-Mofo. You'll land on your feet!

 




 Sure thing. I've edited the comment! 




 What always flummoxes me is how people don't seem to understand that beauty is mostly an arbitrary concept, hugely influenced by societal mechanisms.

Different regions and different times have/had different ideals of beauty, most of which are based on scarcity:

You live in a society where most people have office jobs and don't have time to be outside? A nice tan is attractive. Live in a society where the majority works outside everyday? A pale complexion is attractive. Live in a society where nutrition is scarce? Heavy people are attractive. Live in a society where nutrition is plenty and cheap? Thinness is attractive. 

Knowing all this, most of us still seem unable or unwilling to accept that our notions of beauty are just that - notions, moving targets, influenced by what everyone arounds us finds attractive. Not only do we seem unable to accept this, many of us turn the concept up to eleven - proclaiming that beauty (a fleeting attribute at best) is the only thing to be valued in a partner, while the content of someone's character (more enduring and, I'd argue, ultimately the most important thing if you want to be with them) is being relegated to "oh also, they're nice I guess". Crazy, when you think about it.

Thing is, I would never want for someone to have to change what they find attractive, it's everybody's prerogative to like what they like, but these subs are designed to target people those users find unattractive *because they're not attracted to them*! Why would anyone expend the energy to hate something/someone they're not affected by? It's sort of the same thing as with straight people who fight gay rights: "Oh, you're not attracted to members of your own gender? **The don't date them!** Why do you care what they do?

And it's in following that question that the anger I feel over what's happening in those subs mixes with pity. Because the answer to that question is. "You don't care. And if you do there's probably something wrong with you." 

Ever so often when a post from fatpeoplehate or ImGoingToHellForThis or some equivalent subreddit hits a top spot in all I go and have a look at the discussion, find a user spewing particularly rabid hate and check out their post history. Know what I find? Lots and lots of self-hatred. I think fatpeoplehate especially is mostly made up of (often shockingly young) kids who either are heavy and browse the sub hoping that the self-hatred it inspires will help them lose weight, or kids who were heavy and can't reconcile that part of their past with their ideology in any other way but by ridiculing others (as avatars of themselves, you see this happen a lot with ex smokers too). 

A few times I stumbled upon kids who also posted in thinspo subs (communities that encourage each other in their anorexic disorders). One of those kids confessed in such a sub that she used fatpeoplehate as a way to prolong the time until she finally had to cave and eat something... I'm sure if you pulled more of these threads you'd find even worse stuff... I think we can agree that hating someone for something which doesn't affect you is not really the behaviour of a happy and healthy mind. Sad. 

Sorry this turned into a novel, I guess it was just something I had been thinking about for quite some time...  

 




 I agree with everything you're saying, these subs make me incredibly sad!

That being said, I find your description of of that thread's OP as having a "tiny flat stick body" problematic as well. I understand the temptation of responding to an insult in kind but thin-shaming is a weak defense against fat-shaming.  




 If you have a beard your mileage may vary on that one.  




 Except gay people can have healthy, fulfilling relationships as consenting adults. 




 Thank you for this comment!

I've been lurking in this sub for the past few days and your comment was the most helpful I've seen so far! Like OP I've wasted weight on unnecessary junk (which prompted the use of more boosters, which led to a spiral of clutter). I just tested a more minimalist design with great success. Thank you! 




 I wouldn't care if the showrunners had no idea how the books end, but they do.

I heard about that but I wonder whether that means that they will end the show in that way... I guess time will tell. 




 That's a bit misleading. While there is no 'cure' for pedophilia, there are therapeutic programs that can help people deal with their sexual impulses through cognitive-behavioral training and by counselling them on how to act in high-risk environments. 

The suppression of the sexual drive through medication (i.e. chemical castration) is one approach of dealing with the issue but it's far from the only one. 
























 For a split second I wondered whether there would be Dobby/Pomfrey slash fiction out there before I realized that of course there is. There must be. 




 I think that would be a good idea. 




 I'm not sure whether /r/lewronggeneration applies to people who actually lived/were old enough to experience the period in question. 




 What does infant mortality rates have to do with anything here?

Well, /u/NewWorldDestroyer alluded to the idea that black people get stuff just for being black and I pointed out that one of the things they get is inferior healthcare. 
 
Also, of course non felons get hired more often than felons, regardless of race.

They actually don't. Excerpt from the abstract of the study: 

"Our results show that black applicants were half as likely as equally qualified whites to receive a callback or job offer. **In fact, black and Latino applicants with clean backgrounds fared no better than white applicants just released from prison.**" 




 Thought experiment:

Your brother kills himself. You're grieving for him. A few weeks after his death, out of nowhere, he is being accused of being a terrorist by thousands of self-styled internet detectives. They find his social media and just lambaste it with nasty stuff. They also find your twitter and your mom's facebook and write nasty/threatening messages until the internet detectives realize "whoops, we fucked up, nevermind". 

No harm done?  




 Nope. 

But as Pager Western showed in an extensive study in 2009, black felons were at least as likely, if not more likely, to be hired than white men with the same qualifications who didn't go to prison. [^^Source] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2915472/)

Or let's look another fun study that shows that the infant mortality rate of non-hispanic whites is more than double the rate of blacks.[^^source](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6205a6.htm)

Wait. Shit. I got mixed up, it's the other way 'round.  




 True! And, as another poster already mentioned, peeing asap helps prevent infection as well! 




 DAE hate circlejerks complaining about circlejerks about how tedious and annoying complaints about how there are double standards vs men labeled as "us guys have it so hard"?

Just copy "circlejerks complaining about" and paste it to the beginning of your reply and we can continue this from now until the last reddit server is shut down.  




 You just don't understand! Being a 17-24 year old white man in one of the richest countries in the world is hard living, man.

EDIT: Sometimes I wish reddit still showed the upvotes/downvotes next to the karma, because this post has been swinging wildly between -10 and +10 for the last hour and I'm curious to see what's going on! 




 That's not how disease transmission works. Not saying that there's a five second rule or anything, but prolonged exposure will makes transmission more likely. 

In contrast, if you start without a condom (don't) and only remember to when you're already inside the other person, it's still a good idea to take a break and put on a condom.

 




  they have more of a platform to say the things they say without punishment

That's not limited to the U.S. 




 Is "Human" another app or are you commenting on the ability of humans to count their own steps? 




 Wanna bet? 
























 If you include the separate category for female-on-male rape ("made to penetrate") then there were 5 times as many reported male rapes (over 8%).

Is it actually made explicit in the report whether "made to penetrate" is synonymous with 'female perpetrator' or is that your interpretation?

I'm asking since I can easily imagine both men and women raping men by forcing them to penetrate. 




 I liked E for long stretches of time, who I really hated on that show was Vince when he was coked up. Douche. 




 Got it in one. I'm Swiss! 




 The Van is labelled in German though. 




 Nice, let's get matching tattoos!

Apparently we're either super perceptive or overly suspicious. Time will tell. 




 So.. uh.. Am I the only one who thinks the font on the sign looks like it was photoshopped? 




 What???

Okay, I get that the N-word was yelled when a large part of the citizens of Duluth, MN came together and lynched three innocent black kids (and then sold [post cards](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Duluth-lynching-postcard.jpg/300px-Duluth-lynching-postcard.jpg) of the event) less than a century ago, but I was called a "fuck-up cracker" once in a traffic jam and it deeply scarred me.

 I mean, those kids are dead, but I still have to live with the knowledge that I was called a pejorative name that evolved from my ancestors' slicing open the slaves' backs with whips? For Shame! 




 Dan mentioned Jung revisiting his youth as an adult to unpack and understand it better. Can anyone explain a bit more? What were some of his findings and what were his impressions of the experience?

This is an area of Jung I'm not too knowledgeable about, keep that in mind while I give it a shot. 

Re-creating childhood memories was a strategy that C.G. Jung employed to deal with his own mid-life crisis. The whole thing started in his late thirties - a  tumultuous time for the Swiss psychiatrist, amongst other things he had just severed his connection to his erstwhile mentor Sigmund Freud (apparently not very amicably...) and he fell into a deep depression.

Now, and don't quote me on this, I think I remember reading somewhere that the whole "recreating childhood" thing started after he had a dream about his childhood play. Jung, always ready to lend significance to dreams, started to play with sand and sticks at a park on the shores of lake Zurich (about 2 miles from where I grew up, actually) on his lunch break, trying to recreate his childhood experience. 

Apparently that hunting for the archetypical symbols of his childhood prompted a period of very vivid dreams where he dreamt of mythological figures who advised him on how to move forward with his life. I think he later classified that episode of his life as psychotic, but he also said that it helped him deal with his midlife crisis. 

He wrote his experiences down and, over time, other therapists picked up on the idea - it's a form of therapy that is still being practiced today - I think it's called Jungian Sandplay Therapy or something like that.

This episode stands out as somewhat of an oddity in Jung's work - not the fact that it's about adults digging in sand, but rather that it's about reaching back to move forward, which is more of a Freudian approach. 

In general, and I'm vastly oversimplifying a complex research field here, in the rest of his body of work, Jung wasn't about looking at the past so much. 

Freud and Jung are the two most influential scholars in the field of Psychoanalysis. Freud was of the opinion that many of the conflicts people face as adults can be explained and or fixed by looking at their childhood. He though it was all about looking back.

Jung, on the other hand, looked at those same conflicts and thought they stemmed from an inability or unwillingness to reconcile with death. He was more about looking forward.

On a side note, it's not surprising that Dan likes Jung - he's a fervent Campbellian, and Joseph Campbell's Hero Journey is, for the most part, an extension of Jung's archetypes.

I like the idea of someone posting a weekly discussion thread for some of the more thought-provoking ideas that come up during the show. I say just give it a whirl and see whether people respond to it. I'll be sure to chime in if I have anything to say about that week's discussion! 




 Granted. 

OP did say though that he had a full beer in front of him when she left, and yet he caught up with her before she could reach her room which sounds to me like he made an effort to approach her again... However, I recognize that all of this is pure speculation.

What isn't speculation is that his second approach made OP uncomfortable and that the hotel clerks found his behaviour marked enough to check in with OP. 




 Following the woman up to her room after you've already said your goodbyes at the bar doesn't strike me as a particularly good thing. It's misguided at best, creepy at worst.

If by the "good thing" he did you mean that that he didn't try to force her into anything after being rejected, then your bar for goodness is pretty darn low. I'd call that the basest of human decencies. 

Regarding "OP is a scumbag wife": OP made it obvious that they're both married. So him trying to get some strange isn't scummy?

As for a partner having drinks with a stranger of the opposite sex, I guess that comes down to what you and your partner have agreed to. I've never found it troubling in my relationships, but I can understand why some couples put it on the "No-No" list.



 




 The point wasn't that he got her drunk, but *that he followed her up to her room* when she left, which, understandably, made her uncomfortable.

Naturally this doesn't make him a rapist, it seems from OP's story that he took the rejection and went away. But she felt creeped out by the episode and she has a right to be. What's awesome about this story is that the hotel employees picked up on him following her and that they then made sure she was okay. 




 I know that, what I mean is that the caveats OP laid about his pictures carry no legal weight on their own.

You know, much in the same way as writing ALL COPYRIGHT BELONG TO SONY PICTURES in the info section of a video you have ripped from a TV show and uploaded to youtube doesn't protect you from legal ramifications. 
 




  I said very clearly, that redistributing or altering in any way is forbidden, unless I have given permission and they credit me as original artist

I don't think that's legally binding, sorry to say. Even as the original artist you don't get to say what is and isn't illegal in regards to the use of your picture.

I do hope you get credited though, OP!
