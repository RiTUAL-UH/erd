 The man is a genius. He just plays stupid, so people like him more.  Everyone loves a fool.  




 Say that to their face. Let someone record it first... 




 Did someone really get paid to "find" this?   




 I wouldn't know.  I missed it, for a reason.  




 Fuck you.  Littering is never Ok.  




 Of course it matters.  




 My vote is on asshole trolls from outer space.  




 Not if they have a dash cam or someone else is a witness to you breaking for no reason.  




 Fuck you and everyone that cares for you. You're what's wrong with the roads.  




 Are you a cop? No, then fuck off out of the left lane.  




 Yes.  Rules of the road.  




 I am so happy right now.  




 Is it that horrible to live there?  




 I can't decide if this is a good thing, or a fucked up country.  




 I came here to say this, about.  +1 




 Are you passing someone? No? Then you shouldn't be in the left lane!  




 Don't be in the left lane in the first place then!  




 GET OUT OF THE LEFT LANE THEN!!  He's not the tailgating asshole, you're just an asshole!  




 I had two girls want to make that deal with me, after I asked them out.  All I heard was "you're to ugly and not rich enough yet, but if you look me up when you're rich..." 




 You ARE an asshat.  No justification.  




 Point is, this guy was a negligent ass.  No one should have to handle this due to a "mechanic" who knew about it!  




 You're a careless, thoughtless, asshole.  I wish bad things on you.  You said you knew and let it go. Fuck you. Fuck your family. And fuck you again.  




 I have but one up vote to give.  




 So, I was half right?  




 No, no you can't. Not only would the elections take forever to dry out, but it's the rest of the car that is really fucked.  Mold in the seats, mold in the doors, rust everywhere.  Water gets into places it was never meant to be and doesn't have a way out.  That's why insurance companies always total flooded cars.  




 I thought you could only legally make and sell porn in California and Florida..? 




 I don't know what you did, but I assume you drive like an idiot.  I'd have to be furious to throw food.  




 My wife is a horrible cook, but she at least knows and admits it.  




 I'd go off on that bitch.  Touch my food and we have issues.  




 That IS common knowledge.  




 I showed this to my wife. She's really mad.  




 Fuck that guy.  




 Nice try, NSA. 




 I hate that he said that do much, I almost down voted you, for typing it.  What an ass.  




 Except for the fact that you have an a/c leak that isn't going to be fixed with a can... 




 Thank the diy ac recharge kits.  




 I'm not sold on the fiesta.  There is a rather large selection of after market performance upgrades for the focus st and several message boards dedicated to enthusiasts.  




 I have 2014 focus ST and I love it more than any car I've had before.  Fun, fast, and great as a daily driver.  




 This times a thousand. Traffic engineer people.  Listen.  




 Try speeding up then.  




 One car length. If you leave more than one car length between you and the car in front, I will take that spot.  Keep up with the flow of traffic people.  




 Best. Job. Ever. 




 Where are you supposed to put your beer then?  In some secret fridge?  Asshat 




 Sold meth at a rave.  




 And that kids, is how I met your mother. 




 What about the traffic jam that people cause by stopping in the road, as opposed to pulling off? Example, on a normal four lane street (two going each way), a person stopping in the street blocks off one lane and backs traffic up for miles (sometimes during rush hour).  Why don't people driver up another 100 yards to a parking lot or side street? 




 Kind of a sucker punch, but that guy deserved it!

DAMN, YOU GOT KNOCKED THE FUCK OUT! 




 That's do dumb it gets fooled by decoys.

do dumb

DO DUMB? 




 Were you high on pot or LSD? 




 I guess I forgot to finish reading.  My bad. 




 If I was in this situation, I would go to his house, talk to his parents, find out when he will be home and give him one chance to make with the photos.  Digital copies before I went anywhere/let him out of my sight.  I would not directly threaten physical violence, but he would be able to tell from the look on my face that his well being currently in jeopardy.

Sometimes an ass kicking or threat of ass kicking is the quickest solution to a problem. 




 Not going to tell what the sub reddit is..? 




 Do you know where he lives?  Pay him a visit. 
























 That knife is worth more than $20... 




 Should of had a better best man.  




 Watch TV, golf, and eat out all the time. Oh, we both have new cars.  




 THIS MAKES ME SO ANGRY!  




 I'm now survivor ready.  




 Robin.  Sorry.  




 I was waiting for her to throw or drop it, to show how easily damaged our brain is.  I was disappointed.  




 Batman and Robin.  Batman Forever was bad enough to demand a reboot, but the pushed it one more time.  Batman and Robyn will be forever known to me as the worst movie ever.  




 Blow jobs 




 I find it hard to feel sorry for people who made millions then blew it all.  




 Women drivers  




 This is what i tell my wife all the time.  That and the speech from Team America World Police.  There are three types of people in the world; dicks, pussys, and assholes.  I'm a dick and i feel responsible to fuck assholes who think it's on to shit on you pussys.

She doesn't agree, but it's been 5 years, so i think she's at least accepted.  




 What is wrong with you?  Do you only like happy cartoons?  




 Leaving Las Vegas  




 Did i miss the funny?  




 The kid was a dumb thug.  The cops testimony isn't that hard to believe.  The evidence backs it up.  Blood in the cop car, kid shot at close range.  




 So, what about people that aren't homeless or in prison?  Is there a genetic predisposition to being gay, but there needs to be the triggers in your life?  Similar to people that suffer from addiction?  I've always figured everything in life is a mix of nurture AND nature.  




 I've always thought this was more the case with gay men.  Of course some women become lesbians, even gay men think women are attractive. It's sex with them that scares them.  




 So by that logic, a person who is constantly scorned by the opposite sex, and accepted by their sex, could develop long term "gay" feelings and behaviors?   




 I got an idea.  Everyone there hates the police, so the police should just leave.  Let the towns people protect themselves.  




 One study last week said it proved it was genetics, now this study is suggesting it's a learned behavior.  Nurture vs. Nature rages on.  




 Never worked in a shop?  Oil and air.  




 A beautiful American history lesson from JizzBomb. 









 Literally, unbelievable.  




 Fuck that lady.  I'll drive slow in the left lane, be reckless and film the guy I'm blocking, then laugh when he crashes because I've forced him to speed past my self righteous ass.  




 Fuck more women 




 This should be at the top of the list! 




 This man is my new hero.  




 Did he take the charger? 




 ITT: no shit  




 Police don't just show up and start harassing people.  Something had to draw their attention to said person. If that person then was polite, respectful, and didn't question authority and act like they know the law/their rights, then unless you are breaking the law, the cop will go away.   I've always been polite and respectful, and i always walk away.  My friends tend to mouth off and make sudden movements, and end up in jail. 

Is it right?  Fuck no.  Fuck the police, their agenda, and their corporate masters.  But, i like my "freedom", so when i see a cop, i do my best to be John Q. Public Taxpayer,  and i suggest you do the same.  




 Yes, fuck you.  Safe distance is half a car length, at any speed.  




 Why would we want to buy a tank from the French anyways?  Maybe we were being polite...  Look France, it's not your tank, it's us. We just don't understand, but thanks anyways.  




 These are all mostly designed as a one time use part.   




 Your suspension components.   But sure, drive that thing in, techs need to eat too.  




 Women drivers 




 False.  Porsche 356 pre A. 




 I was once told, you may be able to buy a used Mercedes, but you can't afford to maintain one.  




 Funny, i feel the same.  What's even more funny is i always considered Daft Punk to be an EDM type "band". 




 My wife votes Democrat, and i vote Republican, so now we both save time and neither of us vote.  




 How exactly does one, suck a fuck?  




 Bad luck Brian.  Turns found gun over to the police.  Gets arrested when gun comes back tied to a double homicide. 

Remember,  possession is 9/10 of the law and police don't care who did it, as long as they can arrest someone.  Hopefully it won't be you.  




 This is why 4, 5, and 6 are far better than 1, 2, and 3.   If you take that much time on the models and special effects, you're going to put as much effort into the story and charters.  1, 2, and 3 were beautiful c.g.i. effects, but had no depth beyond that.  




 What does something that happened a hundred years ago have to do with a guy getting jumped by three black guys?  




 Roland 




 Holy shit, i live within 15 miles of there!  I'll be visiting soon.  




 That's the problem.  Engines and oil are getting better, so they tell people that you can go longer in between oil changes, but we still use paper filters.  I don't like going past 5k.  




 No, it's still bitching and he still sounds like a dick. 




 This. I've interviewed close to 50 people and it bugs the shit out of me when they are half an hour early.  I feel that is worse than 5 minutes late.  I'm a busy guy and I gave you the appointment time for a reason.  Last guy showed up while I was still eating my lunch.  =/ 




 Worst. Porn. Ever. 




 Well, that's disappointing.  




 Problem is, too many people drive like thoughtless idiots, so they walk the same.  
























 Grind and polish it down, then engrave. 




 Did you eat the bastard?  




 Comcast.  I don't care if they have a "monopoly", shouldn't the government or some other company come in with a takeover?  




 Now that's something a five year old can understand!  




 Looks like OP got it wrong.  




 I was going to reply that all men want blow jobs for Valentines Day, but this answer is much better  




 I live in a suburb of Chicago, and our plow drives don't give two shits. They have a schedule to keep and they aren't slowing down to give our driveways a break.  Slightly different subject, but I've seen cars that are under tons of packed snow, slush, and ice.  




 This.  I already clear my drive way to the right (flow of traffic) and part of the road (so i can get in and out of the driveway), but my driveway is always full of snow again when the plow comes through.  




 The problem is some people CAN'T get vaccinated, due to being too young, too sick with something else, or allergic.  It's the people that CHOOSE that are putting the people that CAN'T in danger.  




 That's the point of getting vacancies, so you don't get said diseases.   




 Do you want to drive in the road with uninsured drivers?  




 I don't know why, but the last line made me genuinely laugh out loud.  




 The other day = within the last year 




 I like how the show seems to be taking a slightly different path than the books.  




 Do you want spoilers? Because that is how you get spoilers.  




 If you think that really fixed your problem, you're going to have a bad time.  




 Shut down or not, the core needs a constant supply of water to keep it cool.  No water being pumped in, the core will overheat and meltdown.  Source - Life After People.  




 Nuclear power plant melt down.  Without constant maintenance, every single one of those plants are ticking time bombs.  




 I hope you fall deeply in love, then get cheated on, and catch an STD.    




 Drugs are bag, mkay. 




 When i delivered pizza I did that shit all the time.  




 No, fuck you.  




 My wife got a $400 dye job and hair cut, so I got a $400 putter.  




 Looks painful. But why is he smiling?  




 All that, and in the end, i would say it was a failed attempt.  I want my six and a half minutes back.  




 Why doesn't Bob get fired for stealing in both cases?  




 Lots of people don't know that it's then coolant that also provides the heat.  If your coolant isn't good, neither is the heat.  




 An O2 sensor is a pretty hardy device, and they don't go bad that often. If you're getting a bad signal from the O2 sensor, it means you have an emissions problem.  Changing the sensor isn't going to fix anything.  




 I always tell people, a bad signal doesn't mean a bad O2 sensor. 




 Chicago land? We could use a second.  




 I see a cartoon old fashion steam train. 




 I always wonder how people this dumb survived on their own.  




 I told my wife that i jerk off once a day (at least), if she doesn't want me to masterbate then she should do something about it everyday, if not, live with it.  




 Eat some and find out. 




 I was a little sick, and taking a piss when i felt a fart coming on... 




 I'd watch it.  




 Bush haters don't want to hear this.  




 I thought the people didn't have Internet.  So what does the government care if they use up all the bandwidth?  




 Not fancy, ST.  It's the sport addition, part of the old SVT racing team.  




 You don't know anything about the ST, do you?  




 The Focus ST comes with these seats, so why not get a matching baby seat.  




 How else do you brine a whole pig?  




 Yeah, but he got kicked out of the band for doing too much LSD. 




 Fuck you. That is all.  




 Love that movie.  I use that quote all the time irl, and no one gets it.  




 Very dangerous if you're driving around with munitions strapped to the top of your boat... 




 Do you want hate mail? This is how you get hate mail.  




 Just because it's legal, doesn't mean it's Ok.  




 What do you mean, "if"? They clearly are.  




 Who cares what the guy wants, some chick wants to fuck.  




 What state? I want to make a note to avoid that and all the states that touch that state. And maybe the ones that touch those... 




 How is this person still alive? I'm picturing a person who can't figure out how to get food in their mouth.   




 Pcp is a hell of a drug.  
























 AWD = all wheel drive, which is all the wheels turning at the same time.  They're all driven off the same engine and same
 transfer case.  Now that you know that, here is the second part...  Different sized tires on one car, have to spin at different RPM's in order to turn at the same speed.  Add those together and you have a problem for transfer cases. 




 Ironic that it wasn't eating...  seems like he was playing the long game to get a taste of human.  




 Doesn't matter, got arm back.  




 That, actually makes a lot of sense.  




 It being made by EA. 




 I don't know how to do a spoiler tag.  But you can't believe everything to hear or read.  




 You shut your dirty mouth, with that jumped the shark nonsense!  




 Please explain this guys problem then... 




 I had an argument with someone on here, and they swore there was noting in meth that harms you or destroys teeth, that it was poor hygiene.   Some people are idiots.    




 I don't care how much EA sucks, I'm going to give them my money!  




 I wouldn't go.  




 The rich hide and move their money to avoid this tax anyways. That's what trust funds and lots of foundations are all about.  Now they don't have to do this.  If this hurts anyone, it's going to hurt all the tax and estate lawyers. 




 Yeah, I would now encourage my kids to make as much noise as possible, and save that letter to show the police when they show up. I would then ask them to file a harassment charge on said "neighbor".  God save said person if they decided to not call the police and try to confront my kids themselves.  I'll be the first one to give someone a dirty look if their kids are acting up in public when it's not appropriate, but I'll be dead in the grave before someone tells me how to act in my own god dammed yard!  




 I would go outside and make as much noise as possible, during daylight hours.  Fuck that person.  




 Then why doesn't it dissolve sugar?  




 So gas will dissolve Styrofoam, but not sugar?  




 If you don't mind, I'm just gong to slowly masterbate.  




 Fall out, i killed everyone.  




 Third time?  Filthy casual.   




 I don't start shit, but if you hit me, I'm going to finish it. Period. 




 How about you just move over to the right?  




 This cop would of be justified in shooting that uppity bitch.  




 Las Vegas.  Hover damn will give us easy power.  




 Better question, why do you walk so slow and in my way?  Make way for the tallest, peasants!  




 I remember when this was a thing.  




 No mention of Dag's?  




 I've always thought that people that get drugged are completely out of it.  As in, she wouldn't of gotten into her vehicle and gotten in the freeway.  




 Even if she wasn't drunk or on illegal drugs, it is illegal it sleep in the middle of the freeway then refuse a police order to "stop". 




 I pick a different spot  




 Photoshop or perspective?  




 How does he think his "zero emission" vehicles get recharged?  Most of the power in America comes from coal fired plants.  




 Be more confident, pick up on the signs from the girls, and have sex with them all.  




 You evil bastard.  




 Right or wrong, when a person with a gun tells you to "get down", you listen and show them your best dance moves.  Don't be shy, it could cost you your life.  




 Ok dude...  you're clearly a fucking jackass.  If you think meth isn't dangerous, and all the people dying from that shit is because they don't take care of themselves, then I'm not going to keep arguing.  Like I was told years ago, never argue with an idiot.  And I'll take all the down votes.  Clearly redit is a bunch of loopy liberals who will believe anything.  




 You smoked for a few years.  Good for you, you got lucky, so far.  I'll bet money that you'll have health problems in the future.   If you would of kept using, you would of developed issues.  I had a good friend who used for years.  He was a super clean freak, showered, shaved,  brushed his teeth and everything, but his teeth were bad and getting worse, he was always breaking out in sores, and he eventually blew his brains out.  The shit some pharmaceutical company makes in a lab is NOTHING like street meth.  Nothing. If you think it is, then go back to doing meth, and check in with me in 10 years, if you can.  Meth will destroy your internal organs too. Can't blame that on poor hygiene.   




 Are you an idiot or in denial?  Meth will eat away every part of your body that it touches.  Why do you think peoples teeth fall out? Why do you think doing meth for 10 years ages people 30+ years?  And don't give me any shit about how it's all the bad shit they put in meth to cut it.  There isn't really such a thing as pure meth that anyone on the street is going to find.  




 It has nothing to do with skin color, it's the culture.  




 You sure do have a lot of free time on your hands.  




 That girl looks a little young.  




 Who?  




 Three.  Shouldn't it be "an"?  




 The correct response "I'll fix it for free and give you money!" 




 Hornets and spiders 




 Friends come and go, doesn't matter, had sex.   




 Sorry, but that's not how it works.  Wing man breaks the ice.  If you can't close the deal or the female chooses the wing man, then you're SOL.  Try looking in the mirror before blaming others for your issues.  




 Any woman can get laid anytime they want. Just find a horny and desperate man.  

But can a woman land a guy that's better looking, with her personality, the way men can?  Usually not. 

But I've seen plenty of people hooking up at closing time, that would never be with said person in another situation.  Late night and alcohol can do wonders for everyone.  




 I'm only going to break the ice, if you can't close the deal, you don't need a wingman, you need a hooker.  




 Bull.  I'm not a pretty man, but I've had plenty of one night stands, where I get the girl with my humor and wit.  Make them laugh and your golden.  




 If you can't close the deal, why should he have to miss out on some strange? Grow a pair.  




 Are you God or the police? No.  Then get off your high horse and out of the left lane.  




 STAY IN THE RIGHT LANE THEN, NOT SORRY.  




 Ever consider not being in that lane in the first place.  You slow passive drives need to just say in the right lane.  
























 I want!   I love my ST and will probably hold on to it for a few more years, so I hope the RS sticks around long enough for me to pick one up.  




 Take lessons.  Take lessons with someone that users a video camera.  I did and it was the best money I've spent on golf.  




 I actually really like it.  It keeps things new and fresh.  Plus we won't have to wait for him to (maybe) finish the books. 

It's similar to The Walking Dead, in how things are the same but different.  









 I'll probably go stage 3 Cobb, with their standard tune.  Seems like it is safe enough, from what I've tag on all the messages boards.  




 I agree.  My backseat is just an extended trunk.  I've had two single passengers back there, and it's good for them on their own, but if I had 4 people to haul, unless they were 10 or younger, I'd tell them to take a different car.   I love my ST, but I see it as a two adult, and a couple of kids, car.  Not 5 adults.  




 The aftermarket for these cars is pretty big too.  I'm waiting as long as I can (warranty) before I start to tinker with it...  I know I won't be able to hold out for the whole life of the warranty, but if I make it another year, I'll be good to go.  




 I love my ST. 




 I have a Focus ST, and love it.  Have fun!  




 Buy cars and car parts, for restoration.  




 It's a man thing.  Even men who have no idea how to work on cars, are naturally drawn to an open hood.  Doesn't really matter that it's s woman that opened it, all the man sees is an open hood.  Once they get there, they might realize that you're a woman and turn up the bullshit and creepy meter, but it was the open hood that first brought them over.  




 I'm anti government, and pro individual rights, but I'd fully support this in my neighborhood.  I do me, and you do you, as long as your thing doesn't interfere with my thing.  When it does is when we need government, and there's too many people walking their dogs and not picking up after them.  




 Go home, you're drunk.  




 Raising Arizona.   15 min into the movie before the opening credits start . 




 Don't get drunk and pass out around strangers.  Take off your shoes and go to sleep like a civilized person, asshat. 




 Did he pass out with his shoes on? Our rule was, pass out with your shoes on and you get "tagged", take them of and you're safe till you wake up.  




 No one's asking you to like old cars or engines.  Please take your opinion place else and quit trying to kill other people's buzz.  




 I would also think that as part of the interview and hiring process, they would point out the fact that the big man in black can kill you, so not to back talk him.  




 I thought I've heard that most pedophiles were sexually abused as children.  If that's the case, then it has nothing to do with how they were born, but how they were raised.  




 People who say/think, that violence is never the answer, don't realize that in cases like this, an ass beating goes a long way.  Either you get your money back, or you feel better because you just taught someone a life lesson.  




 My wife has an auto immune disease that attacks her joints (among other things). She can walk normally, but always in pain.  She doesn't show it and people give her shit all the time.  Never when I'm around.  The other day a fucking cop gave her a hard time and accused her of using someone else's window placard. 




 Alcohol  




 Yes. Life is harsh.  Don't do stupid shit, or something bad might happen to you.  Pissing of the wrong person, who knows their rights in the eyes of the law, just might be one of those bad things.  




 Ok, per street rules then.  Touch me and expect it back. Step on me, and I'll put you on the floor.  Or are you suggesting that hoodie should have just smiled and carefully moved to another desk?  




 The defense is this: I was being bullied, taunted, and harassed, then in my interpretation at the time, was attacked from behind, so I defended myself.  In fact, the whole thing got caught on tape.  Oh, she was just stepping onto the desk I was sitting at? Ok, I still defended myself.  No body has the right to decide to climb on me, without my permission.  That's the defense.  Seems pretty straight forward.  




 Point being, personal space is personal.  You breach that space uninvited at your own risk.   




 Being "attacked" by legal standards is 100% subjective.  If you poke me, and I feel threatened, I'm justified in defending myself.  




 Anyone who says they had the best days of their life in high school, I just feel sorry for.  How sad to think that someone can peek at such a young age, then have it all downhill from there.  




 If you touch me in a way that makes me feel threatened, I have the legal right to defend myself.  




 The person in the hoodie got stepped on, the girl fell when hoodie moved.  And fuck that, step over me in any situation, and I'll put you on your ass.  In that situation, I was assaulted first and I defended myself.  The law is on my side, you touch me in a way that makes me feel threatened, I have the right to defend myself.  




 More movies than, what?   And I've watched plenty of movies.  Not saying those are the two best movies, just two of the best endings.  If you disagree, please feel free to let me know which endings you think are better.  And if you say "The Usual Suspects" or "The Sixth Sense", or any other movie that ends in a twist, then I'll call you a cheater. ;-)  




 But how do you know that you didn't just save the bad guy?  Maybe he was part of their group and turned on them, and you just stopped some justified mob justice?  




 Try to justify it all you want, but look at your vote counter.  Your wrong and there isn't anything you can say to change that. Asshat. 




 Needs more fire.  




 Two great endings.  




 I'm 80% sure, if not, it's the second to last.  But yeah, it's the end of the film.  




 I love that movie, and that is the best part of the whole film.  Probably the best ending of any movie, next to seven. 




 Yeah, fuck that.  I'm going in.  Say shit and I'm calling the cops.  Rule of thumb, person who calls first gets the best treatment from the cops.  




 I realized how dumb I was, right after clicking "send". 




 If you're getting passed in the right lane, you're breaking the law.  Dick.  




 But if they're speaking, how is he able to tell the difference?  




 Are those like the Lincolns from the 90's?  You got to turn those off or they'll blow.  




 When ever I get asked to go to a strip club, I ask them if they want to go to an all you can eat buffet, but you can't actually eat anything...   




 It's almost like revolutionary is related to evolutionary... 




 My parents *pretty much* know.  The aunts and uncles though... 




 *smacks you with a rolled up newspaper* No! 




 Dude, you're the freaking problem.  




 It's like a grown up Highlights magazine.  Can you name them all?  80's hoopty ride in the back round, cigarettes tucked into the bra, sandals over socks, cheep domestic beer... 




 We used to have Hulu, then we upgraded to plus.  I then told my wife that I'm not paying go watch commercials.  Netflix it is.  




 Yes 




 If it is designed to have different sizes, then it's Ok.  If the engineers want something, they can pre-plan for it.  




 Correct.  Width doesn't matter (that i know of). It's all about making sure each tire travels the same distance as the others.   




 Keep with that theory, and check the organ donor box on your driver license, so at least one life will be saved... 
























 I mean, it's no Hellcat, but I'm looking forward to getting one.  




 Let's not forget the upcoming Focus RS. 




 TIL: Your dad and brother are dummies.  




 lol, too easy?  Drunbs Dread?  The pro's cried so much about how hard it was, they haven't been back.  After playing there for years and years, they made some renovations to make it harder, and the pros didn't want to play there anymore.  




 Anyone that drives a BMW.  What the fuck is wrong with you knob gobblers?! 




 I always told my employees to give the customer one warning about abusive language, after that to terminate the call.  Any manager or boss that allows a customer to verbally abuse their employees is (from what I've been told)breaking the law also.  Employees do not have to put up with a hostile work environment.  




 Well, let's just say I won't hold my breath waiting for the PGA Tour to come back to Cog Hill.  




 No, I  get that.  The US open is at different locations all the time, and they go back to some of them (pebble beach), but I'm willing to bet that if this course plays as hard as it could, they'll never be back.  




 That's a good deal.  They giving you swag too? How about a round of golf?  I got a windbreaker and a free round.  So it worked out.  




 I volunteered at the BMW Championship, the last year it was at Cog Hill, and it cost me $150.  I thought it was worth it...  did you have to pay?  




 The pro's all cried about cog hill, and now they'll never be back there.  I'm guessing next year's open will be at some favored course again.  




 You're the one with reading and comprehension issues.  The masters is in charge of the masters!  




 You really don't understand how the PGA tour works, do you?  




 What part of private tournament are you having problems understanding?  




 Sounds like a neckbeard was trying to hit on you.  




 Even if the PGA didn't consider it a recognized tournament, it doesn't change the fact that it's a private event, held by a private club.  The money is what brings the players, not the PGA. 




 It's a private tournament on a private golf course.  Don't like it? Then organize a protest and try to stop it.  There is no sanctioning body to "correct" them.  




 It's a private tournament, with a big cash prize.  No one can stop it.  




 Stupid people shouldn't piss me off as much as they do, I mean, it's not their fault.  But stupid people really piss me off.  I'm glad to hear this story.  




 Wow.  Consider my mind changed.  I feel like I need to go and reread the books for a fourth time now... 




 The Ace?  You mean Mace?  And noooo, the man is a dunce.  Everything in the shows and books point this out.  




 At golfsmith, they usually do fittings for free, and they have clearance clubs for sale too.  




 Take lessons first.  The lessons might change your swing.  Then get fit for clubs.  It makes a difference, even for us high handicappers.  




 I just finished a set of lessons at golftec, and it's helped a ton.  Last year I was shooting in the high 90's, this year it's low 90's and I've shot an 88, 3 times.  I would find an instructor that used video.  




 My flop shot.  I see it like a gun.  I'd rather have it and not need it, than need it and not have it.  And if you're not careful with it, it can really hurt you or someone else.  I practice this shot 25% of the time on the range and use in maybe once every 3 rounds of play.  




 Check out the myprotogo app.  Frame by frame break down, and you can draw on screen.  It's free and it allows you to send the video in for tips (cost money). 




 No, the man is a dunce.  




 The show seems to have gone in so many different directions than the books, that I can't even being to guess what might happen next.  It's really cool!  




 I'd love to see or read that!  




 Damn, that's right.  And how many walked away?  2? 




 Lots of the head green keepers will have some dog or another.  




 This times a thousand.  In the books, they make this out to be one of the most epic battles of the whole war, and it happens at the end!  All the surviving bad asses from each side, squaring off. Was it 4 on 5 or 5 on 5? 




 I heard a saying once, "try to make something idiot proof, and God will just make a better idiot". 




 Read and play cards.  




 I know that, but I've also seen plenty of things that shouldn't work, but do. And things that should work, but don't.  I've worked in retail, management, food/service industry, product design/engineering, and in automotive repair and restoration.  I've seen some shit. 




 I practice my flop shot a ton.  But I see it like having a gun.  You hope you don't have to use it, but when you need it, it's a good thing to have.  




 I did and I've found it to be true.   




 Have more confidence and ask out more chicks.  




 Worst. Feature. Ever.  




 You can't put a square peg in a round hole, but you can put a round peg in a square hole.  




 There are no shortcuts.  




 She's a keeper.   Your girlfriend seems nice enough too... 




 This needs to be a top comment.  




 Take a drive out to the burbs.  Better courses, better value, and some of the Rangers care.  




 Reading this just made me so angry.  I hate "parents" like that.  I've found the best solution is to say something the very first time the child does something inappropriate.  And I don't say it to the kid, I turn to the parent and firmly say "do you mind controlling your child?  This action/ behavior is not allowed here for safety/insurance/privacy/corporate policy."  If they say shit or let it continue I call a manager over.  When I was a manager, this is what I trained people to say, and if I got called over, I informed them that if said behavior was not corrected, that they could take their business someplace else.  




 Correct sequence is where the lag comes from.  From the top, the swing should start with the feet, then legs, then hips, then shoulder, then arms, then last being the hands and club.  This is "lag", and is probably the hardest thing in golf to get right. 

Since the golf swing starts with the hands and arms in the backswing, it's hard for us amateurs to not start the downswing with the hands and arms too.  




 This is the most correct answer.  The giant club face helps, but also hurts, same as the long shaft.  Mistakes get compounded and amplified.   It's also part mental.  

You should try taking what feels like half a swing and a slower speed.  Just try to deliver the club face back square to the target. 




 My set up - 50 deg gap wedge, 54 sand, 58 lob.  Plus what ever deg the standard pitching wedge is, which comes before the gap.  




 The bounce matters more than the deg.  My 58 doesn't have any bounce, so I can open it up and use it for flop shots from the fairway.   I use my 54 that has bounce, and I just open the club face for short shots or leave it closed for longer ones.  




 Super bowl results.    




 Sex and golf.  




 Sweet story and all, and glad you had a little bright on your day...  And before I sound like a jerk, let me just say that I've worked all sorts of retail and food service, and I'm always polite, but COME ON.  You chit chatted 20 min away, while the line built up?   Nothing drives me more crazy than this.  Look, I'll smile and nod, but I got places I want to be, that aren't in line, waiting to give you my money.  Can you please make sure to just move the line along. 

Once again, sorry for being an ass, but I just want to pay for my shit and go, not listen to the two of you chat the day away.  




 It hasn't been an issue for me, but I'm not racing it on a track or doing many U turns...
