 The voices told her it was okay to attack people because its all just for fun. 




 The only reason I like the Sith more than the Jedi is because of their ability to shoot force lightning out of their fingers. I wish I could do it. 




 She doesn't have a home. Alderaan was destroyed by the Death Star. Thanks for bringing it up...She was finally getting over it. 




 Totally. Right on. 




 Zero fucks given 




 Sounds like my typical weekend. 




 Go to bed grandma. 




 Dang. You beat me to it. 




 IT'S OVER 9000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In the delicious category. 




 Serves him right. 




 I find this incredibly arousing. 




 Stupid 




 It's more funny if anything. The little girl in front row to the left looks funny.  




 Monopoly is over man. Ended on the 22nd. 




 No? It just looks like people spending time at the beach and someone snapped a picture of their friend laughing.  




 Legendary 




 This is amazing 




 I'm so sick of seeing this one. I've seen it 6 times on r/wtf 









 I feel as if I saw this last month 









 He's rather attractive. 




 When did we rename the Internet "the mall"? 




 Some men just want to watch their hair burn 




 do you get what kind of plant it is? 




 There are very few things I wouldn't do to this man. He gets me so aroused just by looking at him! 




 Thank you! 




 I caught that a few months back. I had a Disney day and watched Hercules after The Lion King and laughed my ass off. Fuck you Scar!!! 




 He's from the UK and represented Britain in the Olympics. 




 Video killed the radio star* 




 You're right. They discovered that its actually animal skin. Not human. 




 I like the altered one better 




 I would do more than that to him 




 This is the repost of reposts. I've seen this at least 5 times a week for the past two months. 




 It doesn't look like him though. I know who he is but that's not him. 




 It was just south of Arizona. They found him in a ditch shot in the head. They caught the one who took his truck and by that time they had loaded it with various weapons and tons of blow, transporting it. 




 Someone posted a picture of this guy walking around outside a couple days ago. Who is he? 




 Sleep? Not for me. Because spiders. 




 Agreed. My uncle was killed by cartel members when he was on a business trip. 




 Nicki looks so good. 




 It's definitely animal (obviously) but I can't tell what kind. It looks like a plant eater though looking at the teeth. But then again I can't for sure tell due to quality. 




 Unless there is strong, hard evidence to suggest it is in fact related to the Nazis, this is not what you think it is. I agree that it might be Masonic or depending on the age of the building, just might be coincidence if the building is older than the 1930s. 




 I see dinner 




 Anyone want to double stuff her? Anybody? No? Me either. 




 That looks like my ass. Maybe someone photoshopped some ass cheeks on this lady's tits. 




 I like the first comment. She thought she was all cool correcting the word. 




 This is so SHOCKING.   




 I can't stop laughing at the reactions of all the people behind them. 




 It looks like it's most likely the umbilical cord. 




 It's not a swastika. 




 Obviously not everyone knows it, for example this post. 




 It looks like a Pokmon. 




 I agree. It's a gap. 




 Thank you! Someone knows what that symbol really means and how the nazis perverted it. It's origins go way back and people don't know it means something completely different. 









 Is this from a movie? I feel it is and I've seen it. 




 This gif would do better in wtf 









 My pants just got shorter 




 Pretty sure I'd be arrested for public nudity because I'm not inside all day, like you. But let's just end this because I'm sick of seeing your name pop up on my inbox. Last time I'm replying to your stupidity. 




 DAT BREASTMILK 




 No. I slept. Like a normal person. Because I'm not up all night harassing people on reddit. I have a life. 




 You do too. 




 And again, I don't care. 




 You're so sweet. 




 Do you honestly think I care? Because I don't. 




 I would still shake the hand of whoever tricked me. He/She deserves a congratulations in my book. 




 I give you that, but bacon. That's all I need. 




 She still looks white. That's enough for the media to feed off of. 




 Uh, yes Houston, reading you loud and clear. It seems you don't quite understand sarcasm, over. One small joke for me, one big step over your head. 









 This is...FANTASTIC. 




 It looks like an outfit Sasha Baron Cohen wore in "Brno." 




 Reminds me of the sculptures from James and the Giant Peach that they made out of all the mashed peach. 




 I would be disappointed if I ran to get this mystical "free beer" and discovered it was just a clever way to get my attention to go inside. Then I'd just laugh and buy a beer anyway to commend them on their trickery. 




 This made me cringe. 




 It's shopped 




 It's true. Whenever pretty white girls do anything, America puts all the attention on it. Attractive white people are the news. Everyone else gets pushed aside. 




 It's not even funny. That person is dead and it's rude to make fun of dead people. 
























 I got dumped a couple of weeks ago for the first time after 8 months with my first ever boyfriend. I had never been in a relationship with anyone before, nor had I done things with a guy so he was my first everything. I even ended up giving him my virginity because I thought I was ready. I don't regret it. But I just still have a lot of emotion towards the breakup and keep trying to tell myself I'm past it but it really hurt my self esteem. I'm a bigger guy and so it was hard finding my first relationship and took a lot of time and hard work. I'm 19 and I just can't figure out how to get past it and rebuild myself. All my confidence is gone and I don't know many other gay guys to ask. Please be nice. Thanks. 









 Exactly. 




 Those feels. They hurt. 




 I upvoted because you're cute 




 The red brick road leads to death, disease, anguish and sadness. There's also cookies and milk. 




 Do I see egg clusters from flies or just puss? 




 I don't get it. Is it wtf because its the same? 




 Yummy! That hair! ;) 




 How did it happen? This makes me so sad.. 




 WHAT?!? 




 He can keep playing with those joysticks he has. I'll take the one in his shorts. 




 This is fucking hot 




 Stalin had an iconic mustache yet people still wear the style and he was worse than Hitler and killed millions more than the Nazi's did. Sadly, I admire his mustache. 




 I'm gay and I just got pregnant. I'm scared but I'm keeping it. Take that nature! 




 This is how I feel on all three dating sites I'm a member of, and in real life when I ever get any courage to try and ask anyone out. 




 He gets me all sorts of hot and bothered 




 Decomposition. You'd look like this too if we left you out somewhere to rot. 




 A woman who fucked up cooking?! This is an abomination! 




 Nothing funny about this but damn they're hot! 




 Did you think it meant January 1913? 




 I'm assuming you think that flesh colored thing right under the kangaroo is a ballsack. You're blind. It's a foot. Otherwise, what the fuck are we looking for? 




 I ain't saying he a gold digger... 




 Buddha hand. They smell fantastic. 









 So jealous! 




 Hot damn! 




 Totally a bag from a box of wine. I've done it at parties. 




 Can I marry him? 




 Dark Helmet from Spaceballs. Very nice. Love that movie. 




 Source?? Please! 









 LOOKS LIKE THIS FAGET IS FINALLY GETTING MY FUCKING BATH READY FOR ME 




 HOW ABOUT GO FUCK YOURSELF YOU CUNT NIGGER SHIT FUCKING PROLAPSING PUSS SUCKING FAGET AND DON'T FORGET YOUR CAPS LOCK BUTTON FAGET 




 THANKS I NEED SOMETHING TO FUCK BEFORE GOING TO CLASS

 YES 




 This is really cool 




 THAT'S WHERE I CAME FROM FAGETS.  




 Well excuse me. I didn't mean to upset you. Gracious. 




 Does anyone else think it looks like the dog is smiling? 




 They're all along the bottom and in the background.  




 Do you really not see the maggots? They're on the reverse side. 




 Repost 




 NO CAPS LOCK
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE FAGET
NO ONE LIKES TO READ THAT MUCH 




 THIS IS MY REGULAR FUCKING WEEKDAY NIGHT FAGET 




 WHERE ARE YOUR CAPS LOCKS FAGETS

I WILL STICK MY SUSHI ROLL IN THAT FAGET 




 There is nothing significant in this photo 




 I think he's trying to get into porn or he might have already done so. Anyways, he's fucking attractive now. 




 Ahhhh, Hispanics 




 I think he likes you. With his penis. 




 I honestly thought this was a man who had put on fake boobs. 




 It actually is a legitimate photo taken during a paranormal investigation of the Amityville murder house. It was taken in the 1970s. 




 Yeah, with no explanation your picture makes absolutely no sense. But since I now know, I can say she's stupid. 




 Agreed 




 Nice makeup. It looks good...but obviously not good enough. 




 Try posting a picture of your mother. Wait. That's what this is. Never mind. 




 Could help with sex 




 I'd bang 




 How about attention whore who probably has daddy issues 




 Looks like Amanda forgot to clean out her locker. 




 Just broke up last night. I can't wait until I no longer care. 




 He looks like Wall-E. 




 It's all a matter of food distribution.  









 I did too. And I'm a man. 









 No. Too late. It's been posted quite a bit already. 




 It's a repost. Trust me. I made the same mistake... 




 There are people with thyroid conditions which causes them to gain weight uncontrollably even though they have a healthy diet. 




 Apparently someone already put this up. I didn't see it on here so I thought I was the first person to post it and then learn that someone beat my by an hour. Dammit. So I have to call my own post a repost. I'm so sad.. 














 I agree. It looks pretty good. 




 She didn't choose the wookie life. The wookie life chose her. 




 Where do people get all these photos of my family?! 




 Last year when I spent Halloween in College Station, I got into two car accidents with the same car and had it break down. Then proceeded to push it half a mile into a parking garage. The car was also covered in puke. The worst part about my night? I was sober. 




 Dammit grandma! I said later! 





























 Are you in Texas by any chance? I'm pretty sure I saw this on my grindr 




 There's no need to be coy. I want him to just fuck me. 




 I haven't laughed so much at a comment in a while. Thank you! 




 THIS FAGET PIECE OF SHIT HAS ALREADY GRACED THIS PAGE
FAGET 




 Repost 




 I feel like I saw this the other day... 




 One of my favorite movies too. The first time I watched it, I got so scared and paranoid that I would religiously check every window and door plus any possible entry ways every night for an entire week. 




 Now, who's to say these men are gay? A real gay man would never look this terrible. They're obviously straight. 




 I know your feels bro 




 Fake dummy of Sigourny Weaver from one of the Alien movies maybe 




 Having your foot too close to the side because it has the potential of getting caught perhaps 




 Tommy Defendi (guy on far left) is one of my top fantasies. He is the one who made beards sexy for me. 




 It's either Ajay or Micky off of Fratmen.tv. They're twin brothers. Yes. You read that right. Twins. 




 Damn Tyler Perry. You scary. 




 Even though I like Michelle, upvote for you! 




 Decomposition bitch 




 I'd go with him anywhere... 




 Nice try. Now go cry somewhere because you failed. 




 Never mind. It is Dahmer. 




 As a gay man, I take extra pride in my ability to spell. Maybe you just hang around fucking idiots. 




 I was thinking more along the lines of "Maybe he should coach the Ice King. That guy sucks at catching and keeping his brides." But still, I'm glad you made the reference. :D 




 My heart. These feels. Sigh... 




 Please tell me they actually said that on television. 




 Sometimes I just want to say "Free? You just made it $5 more expensive." 




 The human body has so many toxins and hidden pathogens, you need specialized equipment to safely and effectively remove waste left from decomposing tissue so that other humans won't get diseases. You can't just Clorox that shit. 




 They think our food is weird as fuck too. Calm down OP. 




 The picture on the bill comes from a famous painting depicting Lady Liberty leading the French people into revolution. 









 WHAT STOP WHISPERING FAGET 




 You forgot #swag 




 Meth. Not even once. Just kidding. More like all day, every day. 




 Deer gets hit by car, dog gets free meal. I see no reason to say its wtf 




 You couldn't post the picture of the one with the close up of the balcony of hooded people. Worst repost ever. 









 Can't even begin to say how jealous I am of this... 









 THIS IS SPACEDICKS FAGET
WE ONLY USE CAPS LOCK OTHERWISE YOU'RE FUCKING WHISPERING LIKE A FAGET, FAGET
 




 I should give this to my parents. 




 WHAT 




 Congrats! I just lost my virginity this past September on my birthday. 




 FUCK OFF WITH YOUR NO CAPS SHIT 




 WHAT ABOUT YOUR CAPS LOCK FAGET 




 Very cool. Thanks for sharing. 




 4chan beat you by days. 




 Someone said it but *hearse 




 I just got told that. Sorry about it. 




 Sorry about that. But a simple "hey this is a repost" would've sufficed you fucker. 




 I hide requests and other stuff so I only get statuses and important life events but they slip in and then I think of the other people they're friends and ask "Do you think the other people like to see that stuff either?" Answer is no. 




 I do that too but there's some people I actually like to keep in contact with so I just ask them to stop. They usually do. 









 Inconceivable 




 Aw, you're so sweet! 




 Oh ok. Thanks! 




 It's a pig *gosh you guys* 




 Oh my god, I'm so butthurt. Let me go swig some bleach because I can't take your bullying. I'm so depressed because you said bad stuff about me. 




 *I do my best* 




 Some of the comments are racist? That's outrageous.. 




 *drool* 




 If he doesn't look directly at me, I'd do him morning noon and night. 




 GET THIS SHIT OUT OF HERE YOU FUCKING FAGET 




 You really should. Fantastic movie. Long but worth your time. 




 By proving that they shopped it to be a half a foot longer than what it is? Innovative. You'll go far here. 




 I was just born. How am I typing? 




 What do you gain with this? A sense of accomplishment in falsifying the post and hoping to get karma from it like the fake artist girlfriend poster? Original or not, that alligator is still rather large. This does nothing. 




 Common thing in local Mexican restaurants here in South Texas. 




 Always 




 There's a picture somewhere of them blowing a guy. Just google it, you'll find it. 




 It doesn't matter. But if a white guy does that, it's all over the news and he's a racist. 




 There are plenty if guys, gay and straight, who have nice handwriting. 









 Bitch stole my wig 




 Does OP have a problem with it or OP just jealous and amazed? 




 PETA this and PETA that. PETA bullshit, PETA PETA PETA. 




 It was one of my favorite books as a kid. And my favorite childhood snacks. 




 No hope left. 




 It was nice most of the time. We'd get into little fights but we got over them quickly and everything was good. And being big and not getting guys that often, I have to go for guys that fetishize fat guys. Sometimes it gets creepy. I don't want someone who wants me because I'm a big guy and that's what they like, all those people do enable guys like me to get bigger. I'm trying to shrink, not grow. I want someone who is going to support me in weight loss. I would talk to my ex about it and I asked what would you do if I lost weight and it was a considerable an he literally said he wouldn't be with me anymore. I need to get away from the fetish. But sadly, it probably won't happen. I have to get skinnier before I can find that.  




 It's hard to seperate things because a lot of things I do on a daily basis or some of my mannerisms remind me of him a lot. Things I say, thing I think of just scream out and it just gets me down. My self esteem has always been an issue for me because I'm a fat guy, and I'm trying to change that. It's hard work but I'm trying. He brought me up and then when he said he didn't love me anymore and broke up with me over the phone, it destroyed my confidence. 




 *things I will masturbate to 




 Seriously? Go back to your PETA headquarters and take a piss shower while you're at it. 
























 Honestly, one of the most disturbing things I have seen. I can handle gore. But buff children? Nope. 




 "Can you fuck it??" 




 *Shoe 




 It's called a horse show crab 




 OP, we demand answers. Where is your fucking roommate? 




 Thanks! I don't hate my ex for breaking up with me though. I just wish our relationship had lasted longer. The breakup was really sudden and unexpected on my end. A couple days before December started he just up and tells me he doesn't love me anymore in that way and it was over. I already had gotten his Christmas present early. He was my first bf too. 




 You're at an HEB! 




 I wasn't expecting to spend Valentine's Day alone this year. Now I'm going to be spending it alone. 




 Cunt 




 I would so fucking vote for them 




 Just saying "no" would've been less amusing 




 Fuckin' 




 Didn't Hitler have his moustache in that fashion because he enjoyed Chaplin's films? I think that's the reason but I'm not sure. Correct me if I'm wrong. 




 *shit* 









 I tried salvia one time and I will never go back. My trip was messed up. I grew a hole in the top of my head and water started coming out it, soaking my entire body. Then it was water out of every oriface. I melted into my chair, and my arms fell off. Then I came back together, turned into a black man and got so scared because my friends turned into the KKK and had a burning cross in front of me, and they were all waiting to lynch me. I'm never doing it again. 




 This makes me feel good. My brother is a chef and attended Le Cordon Bleu in Austin. He taught me all these tips about knives. 




 I love PostSecret. I think this one comes from the Secret Lives of Men and Women compilation book. 




 A lot of Mexican and Tex-Mex food places in my area warn customers that their food may contain small bones and other fiberous tissue that might have not been completely ground up.
An artery is nothing. If its cooked and edible, eat it. 




 No matter if people think that statement sounds racist, it is so true. 




 His painting looks like its made out of shit. If I had to paint him, that's what I'd use in order to match his personality. 




 I could troll people at nursing homes 




 HOW THE FUCK DID HE DO THAT?!? 




 I always preferred Marvel over DC. Fuck me, right? 




 It's a repost. If you wonder why you might get down voted, just understand. 




 No it didn't you filthy asshole.
This is a repost. 




 Am I the only one who doesn't get it? 




 What a bitch. Repost 




 Turns out, this fox is a liberal democratic communist loving facist. More at 10 after a full hour of Nacy Grace bitching her viewers out. 




 Mine too 




 Exactly 




 ARE YOU AT BLINN IN BRENHAM, TEXAS?? 




 I thought it was semi funny because all the girls look like feet and horses (except the one on the far left). Never mind then... 




 Rafael Alencar and Johnny Rapid. 




 Please don't tell me this little alien abortion lives in Texas. I have to leave this state. NOW. RUN FOR YOUR LIVES. AND SOULS! 




 I've always wondered what his first experience getting sexed up was like. You know. Since he couldn't touch it himself. It was like super brand new probably. 




 More like THANK YOU for bringing this to a movie theater. 




 Little ginger complained about being kicked on national Kick a Ginger Day. What a punk. Lets go kick him. 




 Agreed. The caption was brilliant. 




 This is cool! I've never seen one begin decomposing in one of those before. 




 Not wtf but I have to say its sort of clever. 




 About to catch fire? What am I? A fucking psychic? 




 Already been suggested somewhere on reddit. Someone posted it back when all those kids at Sandy Hook went down. 




 You are mighty handsome looking! 




 When they first had a website, I wanted to go on it, so I asked my mom which key was the backwards G. 




 I'm so tired of seeing this picture get posted... 




 I love the picture of Raven at the bottom. "If you can't love yourself, then how the hell are you gonna love somebody else? Can I get a amen up in here?" "AMEN!" 




 It was all the fault of the police for not securing the scene. Everyone rushed in, contaminated evidence, and the prosecution fucked up in nearly every way during the trial. 




 Lemme correct myself, they look like they just hatched a several hours ago 




 This in a month? She's in stage two decomp from what it looks like! 




 Almost. From the looks of it, they're still eggs. 




 Good job at getting the joke! 




 Think about it. It's not scurrying around your place anymore. 




 They just need to be more obvious with their sexual attractions towards each other. Makeout in public, film themselves fucking, spread the tape and watch all the teenage girls realize they never stood a chance. So much blood would be shed. 




 Ok, Hinduism. Still wanted to point out that fact it's not the swastika. 




 I have blue/green eyes and after I've been crying, the color goes bright green. Not lying. 




 The Nazis didn't. Stop being stupid. The Nazis stole that symbol, turned it another way, and used to symbolize their Ayran pride. It originates in Asia and is common to find on statues of Buhdda and in temples around different countries.  It is a symbol of peace. 




 *goose 




 I agree 




 *duck

(please go in the direction I'm hoping) 




 Same here 




 I love Tina. Amy as well. 




 OH MY GOD. MUST GET TO WALMART. 




 Quick! Someone slap a brazzers logo on it. 




 Why is John Lennon kissing that man? Oh wait. 




 *eagle 




 Oh god. Now everytime he arouses me I will think of this and get turned off. 




 When suddenly a black man took a picture in front of the booth? This photo tell us nothing. 




 Bitch is serving straight up fish. Whether its cross dressing, doing drag, or dressing as woman due to the fact you might be transgendered, he still looks good painted. Whatever his reason, he looks good. 




 The magic of drag 




 Holy molestor powers, activate! 




 Cards against humanity 




 Bravo

 Wonder if he ever attended a Wigstock festival back in the day 




 I wonder if Johnny Rapid knows when he poops... 




 I never went to see the movie in fear of heavy disappointment. Whatever I've heard from people who have actually seen the series, I am so glad I didn't go see it. 




 It is supposed to be a wine holder. It's only because you have a dirty mind that you wanted it to be what you think it is. 




 So envious! It's beautiful! 
























 I just finished with the tenth doctor today :( I feel like I'm in mourning because I loved him so much 




 This is why I like kids. They're just so funny! 




 This is why I like kids. They're just so funny! 




 Paint me like one of your white girls 




 You never know. She could have pudding in there just to freak everyone out. But she probably doesn't. Just look at her. Pudding? That's too smart. 




 At first glance I thought of Tenacious D and The Pick of Destiny. 




 I totally thought it was wtf when it was posted THE FIRST TIME. 




 The one on the right is Chris Crocker, known for his famous "Leave Brittany Alone" video on YouTube. 




 Hello haha 




 They are featured in quite a few episodes under the ninth reincarnation of the doctor in 2005 when the show came back. I know I'm right. In the show they dealt with a specific family of Raxacoricofallapatorians called the Slitheen. 




 Post it to r/wheredidthesodago 




 Of course, no problem! I enjoy telling people. Also my name is Eli! 




 The creature is off of Doctor Who. It is called a Raxacoricofallapatorian. Link to an explanation of the creature:
http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Raxacoricofallapatorian 




 This looks more like stains from decomposing bodies. They even have human outlines. 




 Thanks. It was my best guess. I honestly just remember how much of an impact it was on the surrounding communities. 




 The Johnson's lived 30 miles away from where I grew up. President Johnson was long dead before I was born, but Lady Bird died almost 10 years back, I think back in 2004 (can't really remember). I lived in Fredericksburg, and the Johnson's in Johnson City. They attended church in Fredericksburg at St. Barnabas Episcopal Church. Lady Bird was such a nice woman. One time when I was 3 years old, we were late for church. We sat in the back row, behind Lady Bird. I was being unruly, not behaving. Mrs. Johnson turned around and told my mother what a cute child I was and asked if it would be alright if I sat with her. Needless to say, I was quiet the rest of the service. She loved kids. I bet she really was laying into her husband. 




 While it may be a gimmick, she really does have enormous talent. She's just gone off the deep end, let the fame get to her head (I think at least). I'm a huge Gaga fan but you have to admit it when the people you idolize and respect lose it. I saw her in concert in 2010. She really is an amazing vocalist and her piano skills are incredible. She just needs to calm it down. 




 I see where you get that and I respect that being her fan. The great thing about music is that a song that can be so small and insignificant can mean so much to someone. A lot of Adele's music speaks to me on a personal level. The music helped with a lot of heartbreak. But, music is fascinating. Songs become personal, and that's the beauty. Some people enjoy it for the tune, the rhythm, the vocals, or the words, and its all about taste. Like wine. You pick and choose until you find something you like. That's how I see it all.  




 I see no difference. In every aspect. 




 What's his porn name? 




 It's the angle of the camera... 




 I think you spelled "*I am an asshole*" wrong 




 **kill the child** 




 Same. 
**24 cents for a pack of ramen is TOO DAMN HIGH** 




 You even used the same title. What a dick. 




 Very 




 He was so attractive and handsome. 




 Sorry someone ate the chips like they were supposed to be eaten and left the ones they didn't eat in the container because they didn't want a whole lot of chips and tried to keep the left overs from getting stale? 




 Someone noticed that earlier 




 Nice little tongue twister 




 http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawfish#section_2

Or you could not scuba dive where they are? 




 Looks like my toilet after really spicy Indian food. But I love my curry. 




 Walmart does a shit job when it comes to gathering carts from their lots. Walmart is just shit. And as far as the cart crew shirts, I'm pretty sure they have them at most, if not, all stores. It's a corporate uniform. They don't really have a choice. 




 Downvote me if you want but...
*knife 




 Because Ozai is an evil dude. Why would he be nice and upvote someone? 




 Agreed 




 lulz 




 That was beautiful 




 This is one of the cutest things I have ever fucking seen. The expression in its eyes was priceless. 




 I fucking love gingers. Too bad you don't like guys. I'd be more than happy to be your valentine. Please take it as a compliment and not a comment from a creeper! 




 *Licked 




 They are. I think the person being locked though is Marcus Butler. They do a lot of videos together. 




 Jack Harries. Yum! Both he and his twin. Wish he was licking me!  









 Closest thing to a man granny has seen in years. Plus, repost. 




 I didn't know medical examiners dyed the brain when they examined. I've neer heard of that. It's cool. It made the brain look diseased though lol Do they do that often where you work? I've seen a couple autopsies but have never seen them dye it. 




 Well that fantastic for you. You go be a bigot back at them instead of being a bigger person and not giving a fuck. 




 And you think this hasn't been posted 40 times either? 




 You couldn't wait at least a day to repost it? Just go away. 




 Repost 




 Totally not a sand crab 




 This has been posted before. 









 Well, I know I'm looking at a repost 




 Oh god what the fuck is that! It looks like a caterpillar but it can't be so what is it! Oh my god!!!!1!!!!!!1!1!!!!! 




 You're the stereotype that prevents me from having straight friends. Good job. 




 -_- so. funny. 




 From the movie "The Mummy" and its also computer generated. 




 It's common knowledge. I saw a post a week back that had someone's thumb with her face drawn on it. The resemblance was uncanny. 




 That guy has been an extra in so many movies.  




 Why not laugh? 




 Oh god, that was perfect 




 Because you're not in the fucking north eastern part of the country. 




 Why do people think it a good idea to repost the same thing everyday? 




 This made my skin crawl 




 Took me a second. I thought you were implying something about a street name. Now I see. I too am "lame"... 




 "I'll meet you there a quarter past Y" 




 Whenever I see Claire Danes nowadays, all
I can think of is her playing Temple Grandin. I always expect her to talk in that way. 




 Some heavy drugs and her sexuality. 




 I remember it being a pretty popular post. A few days ago that is. 




 Is it wtf? Yes. Has it been posted a million times? Also yes. Even if you're new, I'm surprised you haven't seen it yet. 




 Am I the only one who remembers that Daleks can fly and levitate? 




 Nike doesn't advertise in other countries? 




 The underwear of course. Aw fuck it. Who am I kidding! I want all of it!  




 Want! 




 If this is your picture, why aren't you helping? Stop taking pictures and get your mouth to work. 




 ...the fuck? 




 WHO THE FUCK FOUND THE GODDAMN GIF OF MY FUCKING FAGET ASS GIRLFRIEND BRUSHING HER TEETH
I HAD JUST FINISHED SUCKING HER DICK LIKE A SUBMISSIVE NIGGER FAGET, THATS WHY SHE SEMI HARD FAGETS ENJOY MY SISTER, I MEAN GIRLFRIEND
I MEAN BOTH FAGETS 




 Given the right spices and seasonings, bugs probably taste good. 





























 The eyes made me weak and quiver. Oh lord! 




 All day. Everyday. Mmmmf.. 




 My brother is his doppelgnger. He's had people approaching him asking his for photographs and autographs. He just goes with it (for the women) but he says it can be very tiring. 




 I would find so many things wrong with my place just to keep them around. 




 I never realized this... My brain... 




 He* 




 No. He got caught somewhere under my house and we couldn't get to him. We would let him play outside (as long as someone was always with him) and my dad was outside with him, left him out, went to find him and he went under the house. We had no way of getting him out. We died under my house. I was 11 and cried for three days. 




 What's a kd 




 I miss my ferret. I know Pedro is in a better place though. 




 I'm just saying. Doesn't really look like her. 




 You sure that's actually her? Because it doesn't look anything like her facially.  




 I don't believe in prayer. And I'm pro choice. Yeah, no rally or prayer meeting for me. I just don't like people messing with my state. If you want to leave the state, by all means leave, you won't be missed. I don't go around bad mouthing where you live so don't do it to where I live. But thanks for stereotyping me with the people who are no doubt the majority. I just wanted to let the original guy who insulted the state and moved away that he wouldn't be missed. That's all. I could care less about what's said or thought about me on here, just that I'm not the typical Texan. By all means bring your down votes. I give no shits about it. 




 Do I give a fuck? Lets check the board. Show me "Do I give a fuck?" [X] Ooo looks like I don't. 




 We don't miss you here. 3 




 I enjoyed this 




 Lucky guys.. 




 What if I told you that icon says 73 on everyone's phone 




 It's a stock pile of bacon for a burger restaurant. It was on Food Network.  




 Milo and Elijah Peters are twins that like to have sex with each other bareback. The top is one of them, so I'm pretty confident the bottom is his twin. 




 Adalia Rose? 




 It's a small juvenile sunfish. It may be small but definitely a sunfish. 




 But he said

I'm not annoying anymore lol
 




 The black obe.
obe 




 Compactors? 




 The song that plays when she locks eyes with the different people and the screen goes red? 




 His company has a new line of shoes. He doesn't, because he's dead. 
 [He died in 2010.](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_McQueen) 




 Someone bought Hostess. News is that twinkies will be back on shelves sometime this summer. 




 That's really cool! I love all the little things in Tarentino movies. I just finished rewatching this and started Vol. 2 for the hundreth something time.

* **the shoe says "fuck u" on the bottom of it** 




 Good for her, good for her
Fantastic handwriting too 




 So I wasn't the only one who thought he looked familiar. 




 I'd rather support this thing than Adalia Rose.
He looks like ~~Chunk~~ Sloth from the Goonies. I fucking loved that movie. The way they chained ~~Chunk~~ Sloth up. Brilliant. 




 One of my favorites said "shaving the excess skin off your foot and using it as parmesan on pasta - justgirlythings" 




 I was wondering when the typical "post my alarm system panel because it says fap on it" post would appear. Have seen it in a couple weeks. 




 It kind of looks like America 




 Actually, I would say the same top three! I know Detox will definitely get in there. I like Ivy and I do agree, I hate the way they say her name. I liked Coco at first. Then she let Alyssa being there get to her so badly and now all she does is play the victim. Alyssa has gotten over it (except for having little digs at Coco every now and then, which is understandable to me being in the competition setting. People are going to try and put you down.) I would like Coco even better if she didn't have that attitude. Roxxxy is all body and face. No substance in my own opinion. But as far as top three, Detox, Alyssa and Alaska are the best predicted for it. I would want either Detox or Alaska to win though. But, if Alyssa gets that $100,000 maybe she could fix that overbite! 




 I think these top 7 all have something they're talented at. Obviously for Jinx and Alaksa it's comedy, Alyssa is a dancer, and they all display it well. Even though I'm disappointed with what she's done so far, Detox is really talented. She is a great performer in her own right, but I know she can do better than what she's given us on the show. 




 No one this season has any talent whatsoever? If that's your opninion then so be it. 




 You really haven't seen much of her work outside of the show, have you? She's brilliant and every bit as talented as Sharon. Yes she and Sharon do the same style of drag and they think a lot alike, but that is a bullshit answer as to why she got onto the show. I don't disagree that Sharon had some doing with it, but nevertheless Alaska is earning her keep. She needs to change it up like Michelle said this past week and that she's getting predictable. They said the same thing about Sharon. Sharon is all about spook, Alaska does more "glam". They're both unconventional. Alaska is doing a great job. 




 I only down voted this because you were lazy and used "ur" instead of just typing out the word itself. Sorry. 




 Most of the major universities in Texas have quidditch teams. Not weird or wtf. 




 This is a picture of the site where JFK was assassinated. They made a movie starting Kevin Cotner exploiting the conspiracy theory of there being a second gunman who delivered the fatal head shot. In the movie, Costner kept replaying the footage in court, narrating JFK's movements in response to the head shot, that he moved "back and to the left." 




 Don't worry OP. I know what you're referring too. I don't agree with the second gunman theory myself after studying it so much and physically going to the assassination site, but I know. 




 I'm gonna go ahead and say boat? 




 This is genius. 
*thank you for enriching my life with this image* 




 Seen it in Galveston, Corpus, South Padre and Port Aransas. I've seen it so much, it lost its wtf value. 




 Stu from Sean Cody. What a hottie! 




 This guy is a convicted child molestor if I'm correct. So maybe he hides children's underwear? 




 I think it was originally posted in r/wtf a few weeks ago. I commented on it saying "Paint me like one of your white girls" 




 My fancy is tickled. Thank you 




 I third it 




 You must really like downvotes 




 Bad form OP 




 I love eggs, but eggs with the orange faces of human babies are better 




 I am going to call that he pulls a reverse Micheal Jackson and turns into a black woman, instead of a white woman. 




 I bet it's bigger on the inside 




 :O
Justin's butt
I'm dead 




 "diva antics"

Love it 




 These seasonings are really good. You can put that shit on everything. 




 Above any girl up there, Willam is my absolute favorite, hands down.  




 Boy or girl, I would submit to anything Raven wanted me to do. 




 I saw it, noticed it, saw who was wearing it, moved on. I'm not a fan of Alyssa. 




 Him and David Tennant (10th doctor) 




 *their 




 Yes!...they know..it's a multi pass... 




 I would do anything to have sex with Jake Bass. He's one of my favorite porn stars. 




 Dealing with religious friends is tricky. If they love and care for you, the fact you're gay shouldn't be a big deal to them. You're still the same person, you just decided to share an aspect of your personality and life with them you hold value to. If they have issues with it because of their religious beliefs, they should have enough sense to look past it. If they don't, I wouldn't say they really cared for you. But don't take it offensively. They're missing out on amazing opportunity to know someone who is courageous, strong and just brilliant. I've had really religious friends who have beliefs against homosexuality look past it because of the relationship we have and for who I am. Hang in there. I never really believed it when people said it gets better, but now I can say that it gets unbelievably better. I became so much closer to my friends and my life is looking up. I was so low. I have nothing to look forward to but the top of the hill. I hope this helps. Good luck and love yourself. 




 Darn! Oh well. Thanks for letting me know though! 




 Source perhaps? 




 If this isn't a repost then I don't know what is 




 It's riddled with Doctor Who references. I've only had one person respond and know what it all means. Nice fellow. He just stopped messaging me one day. Don't know why. I always watch what I say. It happens a lot. Maybe I'm not saying the right thing? I would have no clue since I've only ever had one real relationship. 




 When I came out to my brother in November all he said was "About time you told me! I was wondering when you were going to do that." I told him because he was the only person with me when my ex broke up with me, via text. It was so great to tell him! Made me and my brother so close. 




 I try to make it as honest and fun to read as possible. After three years of going out to places to meet guys, and the same amount of time on dating sites, I've only had one boyfriend. It lasted for a good seven months. I've been single for nearly 5 months now so I need to get back into it. 




 I just joined that site a few days ago. I'm hoping all goes well. It's my third dating site. I don't do well in real life. 




 Not eligible for the Darwin Award. 




 Imagine having them both at the sme time.. 




 OP can you give the video? Thanks 




 I thinks it's sad there are people like that. 




 Didn't look like her to me
