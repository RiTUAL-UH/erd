 looks like a fun time, i'm in. 




 dat stare 




 i've peed in several places that i'm not allowed to poop.   




 he made a baby man child in computer class?  bravo sir, bravo.  




 why are you wearing my wings on your feet, good sir? 




 just not french canadian, eh!  they talk funny.  like they have peanut butter stuck to the roof of their mouths. 




 Romanianden* 




 i believe you mean Ramen. 




 i also love holding doors for strangers.  the true test is holding a door for someone who is about 20 feet away.  if they pick up their pace they are truly grateful.  either way, a simple gesture can make someones day.  




 is that the stuffed dog from problem child? 




 where do you live?  having lived in south florida (ft laud/miami) for the last 5 years, i must say they have some of the worst drivers in the country.  it's basically canadian tourists vs cuban immigrants on I-95.  don't use your blinker, they scare people. 




 say please and thank you. 




 i recently relocated from fort lauderdale to KC along with my g/f who is a miami native.  she says it's all about layers and a good jacket.  also, as long as your head and feet are warm, you're in good shape!   




 her favorite beatle is a vw 









 i think it's just because you're old. 
























 it appears you received some great info already.

i moved to KC from WI in 2004.  in 2008 i moved to FL for a new job.  i just moved back to KC in july of 2013 because i couldn't stand FL!   i'm so happy to be back in the midwest!

here are a few things i noticed having lived in both states (i lived in boca raton/fort lauderdale area):

1)  the people here are ridiculously nice.  if you make eye contact in public chances are the person will smile or say hi.  
in florida i felt that if i made eye contact with a stranger that they would want to fight or run the other way.  the fake people in So.FL are the worst.  everyone is trying to one up each other.  

2)  traffic.  anyone that has only lived in the greater KC area and complains about KC traffic, you haven't been to FL.  i don't miss the snowbirds or the tourists lost while looking for disney.

3)  cost of living.  when living in FL you're paying tourist prices.  i don't miss waiting for a table anytime i wanted to go out to eat.  

4)  parks.  KC has some amazing parks.  what i experienced in florida was that it was so crowded that parks didn't really exist.  builders in florida would rather put a few high rises and make more money.

5)  the weather.  while people in FL are probably asking how you could leave FL for KS, the weather is very fair here.  people will tell you, if you don't like the weather in KC, just wait a day, it will change.  while living in FL i really started to miss the midwest seasons.  

 




 i ask out of curiosity, why don't you want to pay your own electricity?  i'm sure they take an average of all apartments and sneak that into the rent cost.   




 make sure to stain the carpet on move out day to ensure replacement. 









 i moved from kansas city where i loved living to south florida for a job.  inside i knew the move would be temporary.  after 5 years of living in south florida (ft lauderdale area), i couldn't take it any longer.  home of sunny beaches and shady people.  i approached my boss and CEO and asked to move back to KC and work from home.  they agreed.  i purchased my first home (29 yrs old now) in july and am happier than ever.  i have a great job doing what i want to do and get to work from home.  i would have never gotten this opportunity had i not taken the risk in the first place. 




 i've scratched my forehead many a times trying this maneuver.   




 apparently it's cold in AK. 




 bedazzle wiener 




 needs more bubble blowing and Canadian accent, eh.  




 the San Francisco treat! 




 Clay/Jax = family.  Nero/Jax = 'family'.  regardless, i can't wait for next week. 




 sorry, hypothetically speaking.... 




 how would jax react if he found out nero was responsible for the killing of one of the sons old ladies? 




 he drives it in the snow as well, i believe. 




 lots of random ass grabs and nut taps. 




 if you want a clean kitchen eat at home! 
























 i keep clicking play and the picture keeps moving. 









 i think they (hea)rtrees 









 correct intersection and pool location, young spy. 




 don't judge - it was a long day.

 i think using examples of how to act as a human is more effective than using examples of how not to.  but i get your point. 




 gone and forgotten.   




 Anton's steakbooger is damn tasty. 









 i heard antons has a great booger.  a really great one. 




 eye eye eye 




 mop my palms 




 ah, never thought of exploring the bottoms on my mountain bike!  lots of cool steps and drops i'm sure. 





























 This man had a beard.  Does your grandpa also wear a hat that says 'If you're not wasted, the day is'? If so, I have his business card ;) 




 Man, life is too short to get bend out of shape over funny old people. Even my (awesome and hilarious) girlfriend thought it was funny.  

 




 Ahh, this guy!  I like this guy.   Solid reply. 




 well, when you have no teeth......
 




 i should have been more clear - he was a patron not a worker.  he's always there - that's how you contact him.  oh, and he writes a check every time.   









 having spent 5 years in southeast Florida, i was always happy to see a Packers fan.  down there it's Jets, Giants, Patriots, Eagles.  

i remember being at a bar when the giants beat GB a few years back in the playoffs.  i was one of 10 packers fans in a bar with 400+ giants fans.  we stuck together. 




 18 @ swope disc golf + 18 @ swope footgolf = a damn fine day 




 someone doesn't know how to throw a disc! 









 That bun obviously would like two brats.  Whore bun. 




 mission accomplished.

 i turned it off and on.  i blew out the cartridge and everything.  still nothing.   




 Mom wins at inspiring.   




 his beard doesn't move 
























 SCRATCH N SNIFF MONITOR, i need you. 




 home repairs. 

not only do you save money but you never have to worry about someone screwing you over.  there's so many youtube videos on how to fix toilets, add thermostats, install garbage disposal etc.  it's not as hard as you think.  (TWSS) 




 happy to help a fellow cheeseheader if i can. 









 I would seriously considering ordering one off of DrWobstarCwaw. 




 shoulda bought a weber 




 my roommate did this several times.

other times he would rip open a bag of salad, pour it on the counter, pour ranch onto said salad/counter and eat with his hands.   




 I've been happy with Kim Miley in the past.  No pressure to come back or get on said 'recommended schedule'.  They have a great masseuse as well.

 hit Dynamic Discs right around the corner from Oklahoma Joe's.  http://www.dynamicdiscs.com/kansas-city-disc-golf/ 




 Agreed 100%.
 









 my concern with the pizza was that the giardiniera would make it really soggy.  was it? 




 it's about one block north of 103rd and pflumm on the west side.  right next to where grinders south is being built.  their beef is uh uh good.  i was in there a few weeks ago and the chef told us he's now making an italian beef pizza! 




 $8000 on dirt?!  that's a lot of dirt.   




 I knew it was only a matter of time.
The internet is a small small place.  




 Apparently they make an exception for him.  He must not be as big of a cunt as some of you turds think. 





























 i just picked up a Gstar TL3.  needs some beating before it flies understable like TL. 




 I have one of these shirts having grown up in FDL. 









 I purchased the Weber Genesis in Green of Amazon a couple months ago.  It was delivered for free to my backyard (I helped the driver).  Assembling the unit proved to be simple - this isn't an Ikea grill.

I've been grilling constantly since I purchased it and am extremely happy with it.

Just rip the bandaid and do it! 




 The miracle of life is so amazing - even when it's what seems like an insurmountable challenge.  You and your wife are great parents. 









 You have to soak the corn for at least 90 minutes in ice water.  Toss it on indirect high heat (400-425 F) for 30 minutes turning every 5 minutes.  

I've done the method twice now and the results are insanely awesome.  The husks pull right off.  Butter. Season.  Devour.   




 parboil the carrots for 8-10 minutes, toss in olive oil, salt, pepper, raw sugar, grill for 10 minutes on high direct heat.  like candy! 









 huge fan of going way NW and walking the beach at La Push. 




 recipe!?  




 DOE! 














 get a steak at anton's.
