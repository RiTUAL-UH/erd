 Go with the Samsung, their Samsung SSD Magician software taks the guess work out of configuring the OS to best suit your SSD. 














 And for the record the SR71 flew at such a stupendously high altitude there was no chance of a collision. 




 As I said, I'm over you. 
You're probably feeling like a great keyboard warrior, but really you're coming across like a massive douchebag. 




 I'm actually over you. 




 Couldn't agree more.

If you ever get the opportunity to see one either fly or up close, take it, they're majestic beasts. 




 [edited]

Look, my point was if there was an unfortunate series of events, the TCAS is the last hope to avoid a collision. 

Without their transponder operational, TCAS is useless.

I'm not saying they ever got close enough to cause this, or ever intended to but having their transponder off in such an environment (around civvie aircraft) is reckless, surely you could agree to that. 




 [edit]

TCAS has and will continue to saves lives should the absolute worst happen, and while the Russians may be stellar points, murphy's law dictates everyone can fuck up, and having your transponder on can avoid turning a mistake into anything worse. 




 It was humungous. I saw it fly, it almost appears to hover in mid-air. 




 5 foot 7 inches = 67inches.
According to Ask.com the average Banana is around 8inches,
So I'm 8 banana's tall. 









 Ah, sorry I misunderstood. They had to blow it out of proportion for a good media show!  




 The point is they required flights to be diverted away, which means they were enough of a threat -close enough to to an air corridor to warrant be a threat.

Of course you *can* fly without a transponder anywhere in the world, however if you're going to do it next to/around a busy commercial air corridor expect trouble.. 




 A plus 1 for you Sir. 




 The reason they had to be escorted away immediately is because the world has a very effective and proven collision avoidance system, but but it relies on an active [transponder](http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision_avoidance_system) which the douchebags had turned off. 

Do you really think this would have been so funny if a commercial airliner collided with one of these guys because that was a real possibility.

You can't just fly in international airspace without your transponder on, that is just incredibly arrogant and puts lives at risk. 

Of course they knew this was going to happen the moment they flew into commercial airspace. 

For fucks sake why are they risking an international disaster by bringing down an airliner in a mid air collision while the world is itching for an excuse to start WW3? 




 Petrol starts to naturally break down, and only lasts a few months once it's been processed.

 I've just freshly installed it into chrome, thank you for suggesting it. I couldn't agree more about the devs implementing it, would result in less edits, and more intelligible posts.

However for people who don't/can't use Chrome I feel it would be a well used feature, and can't fathom why it's not included. 




 Ah, thank you will install on my Desktop.

Although I use Opera mobile when browsing and posting on the go (so most of the time) so having a feature which isn't browser dependent would be nice.

 No, 2 reasons why I think not:
1- when you have testers in the field you're introducing the human element, and exposing it to be be seen by eagle eyed enthusiasts. Or just simply left in your local pub.. (e.g.infamous iPhone debacle)

2- If you want something released for public consumption it needs to be certified, and with certification companies releasing their records almost immediately. (E.g htc One camera leaked.)

 Proper green stone jewelry, an appalling amount (especially the stuff in the tourist shops) is actually cheap Chinese jade.

If you want proper Greenstone rock on over to the Westcoast. Any reputable seller will happily tell you where it's from.

Be prepared to fork out a bit for it though, proper greenstone can be quite expensive due to Ngai Tahu's exclusive rights to sell it.

 Ah I see. I'll report that then. App dev's aught to be paid for their hard work.
Also Reddit post says:
"submitted 19 hours ago by [deleted]" hence why I thought your account was deleted! Odd. 




 My point was (however ineloquently stated) why should we report it, you need a valid reason. Just saying "an app for piracy" is useless without a context, like maybe this dude had his app stolen? 

Secondly don't link to it with the main header, as that just piques your interest into downloading it, which rather defies the original purpose of the post. 

That makes me think this was thinly veiled (and rather shameless) advertising. 

But then that probably explains why the dude's deleted his account.

Every day man! :-) 









 Well I can thank you for putting me right. 
I strive to make at least semi educated comments, and it's become apparent I have missed the mark here somewhat. Consider me enlightened. :-) 




 I respect what you're saying, but as a layman I have only my opinions based upon reported isolated incidents- articles like this? And other stories brought to me by the media. 
I only know what I read on the internet, and (as with most subjects) what the media portrays. 

Based upon the above my comment still stands however based upon my opinion formed. 

As you're educated on the subject I understand where you're coming from and it must be frustrating to read comments like mine, but let's be honest here, it's not likely to change as the media aren't going to change how they report things of this nature - e.g. "anticorruption measure" stories will get buried amongst stories about corrupt officials each and every time, so can you blame me?  




 I'm saying the country as a whole is very average - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_India

"..But many analysts believe India's sprawling bureaucracy and weak institutionsthe police and judiciary were ranked as the second and third most corrupt institutions in India, respectively, after political partieshave thwarted convictions, and arguably increased incentives for bribery. In recent years, graft pervaded society from small-scale "harassment bribes" (payments for essential social services) to scandals on a national level. At least 42 percent of young Indians have paid a bribe, according to a 2012 Hindustan survey"
[source](http://www.cfr.org/corruption-and-bribery/governance-india-corruption/p31823)

And I specifically refer to the corrupt judge's trial - http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bribery-charges-trial-against-judge-may-finally-begin/article4978237.ece

And now this, which the high court has thrown out as clearly some very dodgy motions were passed without due diligence. 




 Just got home, baby is in bed, I'm on Reddit to unwind after a bloody long day! I'm a kiwi so 7.30pm here!  :-) 














 The night mode didn't adjust for 'night mode' at all. Then I went into my default Samsung camera, selected Night Mode, then hopped out and back into 'a better camera' and voila - night mode activated.

Also flicking between front and back screens causes the camera to freeze for around 2 seconds.

Also changing to and from Video - camera mode causes screen to freeze, need to escape it and get back in.

And HD video quality is piss poor when pixel peeping vs stock Samsung S4.

On the PLUS side, takes very nice HDR photos.

 Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you my Prime Minister.. 




 I found Opera crashed frequently, but that was a few months ago I last tried it.

To be honest my phone didn't feel "right" after installing it, Apps were a bit slow to respond, and crashed infrequently, but often enough to make me uninstall, and everything went back to normal.  




 Thank you kindly good sir.

Edit: Actually it is a much better low-light camera than the standard App, (Samsung S4) as it focuses better, and with the HDR mode always on, offers an advantage over the HDR mode over the Stock S4 camera as HDR has to be selected everytime, through a rather clunky menu. 

Very good, and hell, it's free so always a worth a shot! 




 Perhaps forgive my ignorance, but why not take the SIM card out and put it into your phone? The contacts may be old, but could still have "mum"or "dad".

 Best comment I've seen on Reddit for a very long time. 

Nice.  




 Actually 4K is rather useful for video editors and even downsampled to 1080p is actually significantly higher quality than native 1080p.

Also with 4K TV's becoming eye poppingly cheap it's quite affordable for people replacing their current sets. 

And furthermore given the competitor has been offering this feature for a while you can't tell me there's not a market for it. 




 Yes, but as I mentioned earlier the 4mp module on the HTC M8 simply doesn't have the same dynamic range of the higher pixel sensors resulting in washed out highlights and lack of detail in the shadows.

I agree Apple have things right - they've gone with 8mp coupled with phenomenal software support resulting in one of the best cameras for an all round solution. 

I have an S5 and cannot understand how awesome the phase detection is for focusing, especially in low light. But why they didn't incorporate all the technologies into a single unit is beyond me.

I'm hoping HTC pull finger and release an awesome unit (phase detection/range finder/OIS), coupled with fantastic camera software (Zoe?) and just blow everyone out of the water. 




 I don't know if you read the review, they had to deliberately cool the phone down between benchmarks. LG were contacted who advised they are still tweaking the final product, so perhaps it was a pre-release hiccup.

I reckon Qualcomm have got a lot riding on this after Samsung's snubbing, so I daresay they'll be working closely with LG to ensure there are no issues. 




 No. 
Extra megapixels also allow you to crop photos after you've taken them.
Extra megapixels allow higher quality (read:4k) camera capabilities.
(Note this last point may be why HTC rumours indicate 2 camera modules on the M9? - 1 high pix for UHD video, other Low "ultrapix" module.)
 




 You have to hand it to HTC, however you needn't look any further than the decision by Sony to [release the Z3 as a 1080 screen](http://au.ibtimes.com/xperia-z3-sony-unwilling-sacrifice-battery-life-2k-smartphones-1368833) which they were slated for and forced to explain why. (Battery life of course..)

However it proves the world (as of September 2014) wants 1440+ higher screen sizes in their flagships, so it's going to be a risky move. Then again HTC are if anything happy to take risks! 




 It was extremely hampered by early reviews and the narrow dynamic range. GSMarena slated it as even when down grading the competitors camera from X-4MP they still did significantly better. 
(I will say except for low light, where the camera excelled but realistically most people want a good all rounder than an awesome 1-thinger.)  




 Bother. Thank you very much for answering my question :) 




 I missed having a flashlight widget too much.. Or have they fixed that?  




 Thanks, that's a good idea. 




 No offence, but isn't that cutting off my nose to spite my face? I still want to listen to music on my phone, I just don't like the spotify wakelock keeping my phone awake when I've already closed Spotify! 




 I do. 

It's just frustrating that it's not a 'feature' I can turn off, as I usually (as most people do.) turn my phone off and keep listening on their desktop, not realizing their phones are quietly still running.  




 I was listening to music on my mobile, but closed it via the X on the notification widget. However when I started listening soon after on my desktop I still had Spotify controls on my lock screen only. 

I guess the *feature* here is you can pause/next your music without going back to the Application on your desktop. The severe downside is it keeps a wakelock open, draining your phones battery.

Because it doesn't display the ability to shutdown (No widget in the Notification centre) so I've found the only way to stop the wakelock is to Force Stop the Spotify Process in Android Application Management.

Ignore if this doesn't bother you, but I use Spotify on my desktop to save my battery life, which makes it kinda pointless to keep my phone awake.

 We need an ELI5 for saturation points on phones.

I mean yes there are still untapped markets, but most of those won't be buying 2k screens at current flagship prices, so how can they gaze into their crystal ball and say 2k are going to be the mainstay when most people don't want over 5.5 inch devices, and with the market flooded with such devices why your average Joe would choose a 2k screen over last years flagship with a normal HD panel?

 The simple fact is people will do stupid shit and try and run regardless of whether the police will chase them, in nz we've had quite a few people die from smashing their car after the police have even called off chases minutes before.

You can't apply rationality to irrational people. 




 I see your point, but I would argue it was made our business the moment they went public. 




 That's an interesting, and probably quite accurate account, as it explains the medical check too. 




 Weird. 

I get the feeling we really got kept in the dark/were deliberately misinformed and mislead over this whole story. 

Like they wanted to paint a picture of what an awesome person she was so we'd keep an eye out for her.

While negating to inform us the circumstances under which she was found, and then offering us the teaser "She was checked by medical personnel" makes me believe she was far from the perfect mother etc portrayed by the media.
 




 That was sooooo satisfying to watch.

People running from the police are so fucking selfish, it's good to see some good old fashioned street justice. 




 Oh, so they love to know where you are without a warrant, but god help you if you want to find out where they are?

 Actually captured him quite well. Good job. 




 However he's also managed to oversee a government which has approved some of of the most utterly appalling environmentally crippling policies like allowing dumping on the Great Barrier reef. 

He's also attracted world wide ridicule by attempting to deny climate change. 




 I hope so. 

the ISOCELL is a very interesting development in Pixel technology, I strongly believe that when paired with a good OIS it will bring superior low light performance over standard BSI OIS sensors. 




 I was kinda hoping for an ISOCELL OIS camera module, but 20MP doesn't sound like it.
The Sony IMX240 equipped Note4 with OIS wasn't the best in low-light.

Still very exciting! 









 I'm sorry but are they fucked in head? 

Fuck this makes me angry. 
Fucking greedy corporations who can't be fucked to clean up their act. 
Egged on by fucking greedy politicians who want their campaign money. 
And stupid fucking residents for allowing this to happen.

The environment is just fucked. Doesn't even stand a chance. 




 There are more than one ways to skin a cat - like with Sony's curved sensor array promising higher light sensitivity!

The simple (and tragic fact) is more/bigger pixels are not feasible while the market craves smaller devices.

 Android RAM management has become significantly better than older Android versions. These days with richer Applications and more RAM than ever before actually clearing your RAM can result in an impact to battery life as the OS needs to reload the Apps back into the RAM you just cleared. (For instance most Opera Mobile using desktop mode has over 200-300MB of RAM constantly.)

Likewize with Application cache (the other reason people use them) I can appreciate people who have very limited device storage using them, but they're a crutch as if you have to use it more than once a week due to space issues, chances are you need to upgrade your phone anyway. 




 lol. Then you'll get people complain about the noise, you can't win! :D 




 I appreciate that sentiment, I don't know what phone you have, but the S5's "phase detection autofocus" is light and day difference over the not-awful S4's focus.

but yes, I hear you on the low light issue. 
This is something that needs to be fixed on the sensor as IOS is not the silver bullet we need.

(From the screenshot comparisons between the S5 and Note4 (although different sensor Sony IMX240 vs Samsung's Isocell) the differences for the lowlight shots are not as awesome as I expected the OIS to be able to perform with the Note4.) 




 Had a wee chuckle at your comment- brings back memories!
 




 Well said. 




 It is but it's certainly a step in the right direction. I think most consumers have come to accept a slight protrusion, however 12mm (plus screen etc so more like 15mm) might be a tad thick. However you are getting 3x optical zoom!

 I know! They make fantastic (if horrendously expendy) filters too, so I have little doubt this module will be to a high quality standard.

Can't wait for camera samples. 




 The way I read it makes it sound like she blamed the bus for not being loud enough, so she didn't bother looking. 




 My S4 took significantly better photos (edit: In good light!) than our $600 Fujifilm EXR from 2011 though. 

People who want better quality will always buy a better dedicated camera, I'm talking about the entry level ($100 cameras etc.) 




 Nah, it's only a suggestion. :) 




 Indeed, the only digital zoom I'll ever appreciate is the Nokia Lumia Pureview digital zoom implementation. 




 Yeah, I hope that Stuff have just edited out that little sound bite out of context, because blaming the bus for being silent and then admitting you didn't bother looking doesn't make her come across as the sharpest knife in the drawer.

Of course if she's a Redditor and would like to defend herself I welcome her side of the story. (If there's more to it.) 




 Thanks, I didn't realise it was also stabilised! 

Yes, however due to the fact it was developed by a 3rd party - Hoya I'm hoping it's not patented to Asus, and could potentially make an appearance on other devices. 









 I really wish I could post this to the r/nottheonion/ but Stuff are such a shit tabloid news site they don't accept submissions any more from there! Anyway, this is pure Darwinism in action. 

I also laughed at the fact they had comments which had to be disabled, I'm guessing due to the fact they ripped this girl a new one for actually blaming the bus for being "silent".  









 NZ, no such luck in our High Schools unfortunately, although that was 10 years ago so things may have changed, but I doubt it.

Not even as an optional study, I would have taken that class in a heartbeat. 




 That is very cool that you get taught about the myths though. 




 You have myths class?!  




 Awesome, gosh that was quick!
I'm surprised this ran on your phone, it doesn't support Kit-Kat.

 The silly thing is the fact most Applications on your cellphone can do this, and much much more: 
See your photos, record your voice, view your location hostory, view your website history.

Yet everyone just clicks the "Install" button without a second thought.

Yet God forbid a company are actually OPEN about the fact that in order to provide you a service using your voice they WARN you that your voice is being recorded.

Come on people. Props to Samsung for being open about this at least. 




 LG are just as bloody bad!
"LG smart TVs send data about users' files and viewing habits to the company"

 Anyone else reminded of the movie "Alive"?  




 Brutal.  




 Well you see on your graph how the 'awake' is damn near a constantly solid line! 
While your Screen on graph is only sporadic and doesn't match with your 'awake' line.

This basically indicates there's errant background processes which is sapping your battery life.

These errant processes are usually:
Google scanning for your location (as requested by Adware on your cellphone)
Google Now waking up your phone to either see your location or present you new cards.
Weather Apps/widgets updating.
Email/Facebook apps updating themselves.
Background data use (think Spotify/music playing etc.)

The best way to determine what's sapping your battery life is to get Wakelock Detector.
(However due to the fact Google are bastards they don't want you to be able to access the indepth analysis battery stats.)
So you need to use a work around (nothing scary!).

Step 1- acquire a windows PC.
Step 2- Go here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r3VlhZIZVSufZlAeICJet6QBtyAF7z06_ysl1kUKME4/edit#slide=id.g298bc178a_00
Step 3- follow instructions.

I've done it a few times now, this will allow you to actually see your Wakelock stats (so in effect that's sapping your battery life by waking up your phone!)

Once you have your Wakelock stats post a screenshot on this subreddit can we can help you to determine what's the matter. 




 Sweet jesus man. Your battery life must be awful.

Are you worried about your battery life? What do you get - my year old S4 got 4hours SOT /8 hours standby.
 









 But is upping the pixels the best way to do this?  




 To answer the op, technically no. But it's very relative to your previous experience with screens. 

What I mean is if you haven't had an amoled before and look at the note 4 you may think the color and other amoled properties are a QHD attribute. 


There's the old (and very relevant) issue of the human eye simply being unable discern the individual pixels, above a certain dpi. 

This shouldn't be ignored, however at 5.7 inches I'm willing to believe those with extremely good eye sight can see a difference under optimum conditions. 

Is it worth it (I know not what op asked, but these two questions are closely related) for most people an awesome FHD amoled will provide the same wow factor and provide awesome battery life. 




 I feel mislead by the title, I thought op meant Don Hertzfeldt's rejected: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkrJB7Q0X3Q 









 There's something deeply insidious about this. 




 Does it play clash of titans?  




 How many people clicked the link just to see the lesbians kiss? Come on.. you know you did. 




 What aren't dashcams good for?! 

Seriously, there are now entire Youtube channels dedicated to dashcam footage from Europe.

And now just entertainment, we've benefitted scientifcally with detailed footage of meteor showers for instance.

And now one's capture a freaking commercial plane crash! That's awesome. 




 Considering what that man has done for science - take it out of the classroom and into millions of peoples living rooms I'm stoked someone has found an appropriate way to ensure his legacy will live on. (Aside from DVD and Bluray sales of his shows of course.)

It's a great honour and bestowed upon a worthy person. 




 Plot twist: all 4 dead were found in the morgue!

Thank^you^I'll^let^myself^out 




 Thousands of men all around the around laugh nervously and cross their legs. 




 What's the icon?!
 




 You're right, and "State commisioned murder" has such a lovely ring to it.. /s! 









 It just adds to the abhorrent nature of the crime commited by the police.

I think the wording was carefully chosen in the article to articulate the difference between the police forces.

The ranks of the elite riot police wear **riot gear** for protection. 

The ranks of these scum wear **masks** for anonymity. 




 There's something deeply wrong on so many levels as that sentence: "masked police". 

Any police that are wearing masks are instantly not worthy if the title "police". They are criminals posing as police. 









 Samsung have a reasonable video editor in their "Samsung store".

I can edit videos taken, and then compile my own videos from the clips on my Samsung s4.

Maybe see if there's an alternative for your device? Or see if you can acquire and sideload the apk?  




 So chump change for them then? 
This is the rich making the poor on a merry dance while their friends rob them blind.  




 This is a genius post! Catch upvotes by laying a trap for all the lonely posts without upvotes. 
Outstanding logic.  




 Your parents were probably having some fun to the #1 song on Sunday, July 27th 1986 which was: 
Sledgehammer by Peter Gabriel

Too much information. 




 sadly no....... I'm sure it's out there! 




 I know. Well done on doing your homework, it's stuff like this that I'm sure Stuff aren't allowed to post for fear of their masters coming down on them. 

It's sickening really. Unfortunately it's never going to change, ultimately it is only going to get worse. 

As governments the world over have shown big business owns legislation to ensure they continue to make squillions of profit unimpeded. 




 That's.. Awful. 




 I know right!? Something is a bit smelly with the whole affair. 




 you needed a /s there! :P But yes, that's basically their thought process. 




 lol, no.. 




 It's the impact to the image of the company they represent that the company are worrying about.

For instance an older person might hear a rumour that 2 married employees have an affair and will choose to take their business elseware. A younger person however would go "whatever." so given this is an insurance company, they will be looking at the age etc of their clientele to determine whether this is enough to make people not use them. 

Of course the other side of the coin is that the company may realise (perhaps after an analysis from a PR agency which I daresay is already happening) that they in fact gained from their employees indiscretion and may allow them to keep their jobs.  




 Personally, I still do, but the wife went to Whittakers long ago. 
They still have a humungous following regardless of their piss poor business choices. 

Then again in NZ there's only a duopoly - Whittakers and Cadbury. 




 They got lax. They released bad business decision - changes to their product - after bad decision with no mea-culpa it's all "To protect our increasing profits." 




 Haha, I tried last night. However surely someone can find it!? 




 Judging by some of the commentators it was at least 30 minutes, so there's that. 




 Indeed. 

What's the easiest way to lessen the blow of any change in their core product - give away free shit.

Where's the free shit Cadbury!? 




 Right, which makes the profit, coupled with this announcement all the more brutal. 




 Ha-de-ha. You think this isn't part of what's going to happen in your part of the world too? 




 I have to wonder if the marketing genius's at Cadburys saw how well the announcement went down for Whittakers and presumed they could pull the same stunt? 




 Also (I don't know how much Australian choco makes it to NZ shores) but the Aus arm of Cadbury posted a humungous profit last year -

**CHOCOLATE maker Cadbury recorded a $127 million profit in the year Prime Minister Tony Abbott promised the company a $16 million grant to revive factory tours.**
[Source](http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/profit-blots-blots-cadbury-aid/story-fnj4f7k1-1226978294004)
 




 And Aussie too...... They forgot the NZ public have memory like elephants, companies are not easily forgiven for messing with an iconic product! 














 If I find it I'll post it!

 True. Although if true you have to spare a thought for their families... what a time. 




 Just their building, not their employees as I understand. But yes, free publicity regardless! 
 




 Oh. dear....... God this gets worse and worse for them.. 




 It was harmless until the name of the company was released, by the company. As mentioned earlier, they may have made it worse for themselves a bit. 




 You're probably not even half wrong...... 




 Perhaps, we can but wonder really. Probably bystander effect too, everyone else thought everyone else would do something. (if you get what I mean?) 




 lol, they hopefully won't, the whole flying the corporate team into CHCH for damage control seems a bit overkill though. 




 Actually, really good point. In this day and age sometimes a good denial and complete media silence is the best policy. 




 A comment on the article would lead you to believe the guy did. Worst possible way to be caught if that is the case..  




 If it was the second floor as mentioned earlier, can't exactly knock on the window.. 




 It's not that they were having sex, it's having sex with the lights on beside a busy pub. 

Bear in mind cellphone camera's aren't the best low-light cameras, so for the some of the clips to be such good quality one can only presume they were lit up like a xmas tree.  




 Haha, fair call.. 




 Ah, thank you for the clarification. 

Still clearly (judging by the photos) visible to outside though..  




 I'm sure they'll be somewhere in imgur.. I would search but on a work machine. :D 




 You feel sorry for them, but in the same breath, having the lights on at street level.. You have to wonder if it was deliberate (hence the 'caught'.)

I also really hope it was all above board, and wasn't an affair, that's perhaps the worst way for an affair to come to light.. 














 Very true. 
























 As we live in a 'destination' area usually frequented by locals and visitors this aroused by suspicions a bit.

Mindful the neighbours car was broken in to a couple weeks back  I rang local police to report the van in case. They offered some friendly advice which in retrospect seemed obvious - just go and talk to them? 

So I went out, had a quick chat. It was an Asian couple, they spoke very broken English but the gist of it was they had just arrived in NZ, and were going on a long trip and wanted to make sure they were comfortable driving with the new car, and were used to driving on our roads before they headed off! They kept repeating "Safety!".

I thought it was very nice of them to take the responsibility so seriously. 

I just wanted to share this with you all to highlight the vast majority of tourists are responsible on our roads, it's just the incompetent arrogant few who ruin it for the many. 









 Yeah, a con artists who has set up a grant to inspire young inventers.. [What a total wanker.](http://www.jamesdysonfoundation.com/) /s 




 Jesus, little wonder you guys have no faith in your police or judicial system. Really can't blame you when they don't even give you a choice like this. 




 Your police and bureaucracy really really suck shit. I guess we should appreciate what we have in nz then. Appreciate your comment to help me gain some insight. 




 That is some fucked up shit. Ok, I understand where you're coming from, but they're looking for a reason to target you. By obeying the law you're rendering them toothless, powerless to stop you. Isn't that kinda empowering in its own right?  




 Why? For the record I'm from NZ, so this kind of shit very rarely happens here, we have a very different attitude to our police force (at this stage.) so please help me understand?

 




 Fucking beautiful. 

Their critique was cringeful to watch, it was an unabashed insult laden chastising that was uncalled for. Then **to insinuate he could be a mass murderer because of the fact he took pride in his appearance and you think he wanted to dress like  you**??? That's just makes you look like an arrogant fucktard.

Fuck the guy was there to sing, not to be judged for (what I though) was a spiffy looking suit.

He took pride in his appearance, they have no fucking right to put him down because he actually took the effort to look good. 

I honestly couldn't watch their foul mouthed display, I felt ashamed for the guy, on the upside, what a fucking gentleman, stood there and completely took it like a champion without a word of retort. 




 Fucking Americans.

A deranged mental idiot uses any gun he can get his hands on shoot a lot of people..

The gun company didn't give her the gun? I presume they didn't tell her to leave the gun out? I also presume they didn't tell the guy to use their gun? No????? So how the FUCK are they being held liable?!?!  




 Here's a novel idea, don't give the fucking police a REASON to arrest you, and they WON'T arrest you!?

Firstly: 100 people marching with purpose through a city can cause a lot of traffic mayhem.

Secondly: it's fucking expensive to hold up traffic, to get diversions in place and have a police stop the cars because I'm sure they reallllly don't want some impatient git flooring it through the middle of the crowd.

Thirdly: you're protesting against police, which is already getting their hackles up, don't provoke them by breaking the law. Just no. 




 Because (and yes, i'm going to shamelessly paraphrase you here.) Everyone wants to justify sinking a grand's worth of wages into their shiny new toy. 

Judging by the comments on a lot of posts, we have an awful lot of HTC and LG phone owners who frequent /r/Android (Jesus, should have seen when the G3 was rated best phone by the MWC, the mods were cleaning the semen off the floor for days, it was a major circlejerk.) and when the competition does something better they naturally want to bag it to make themselves feel better. Human nature I suppose. 




 That is true. 




 OP, after lurking in /r/android for a few months now, you have a lot to prove as the vast majority here really love bagging Samsung the first chance they get.

I love the figures, but when you have the first decent review:
http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/2yyftj/samsung_galaxy_s6_review_subject_zero/
And the top comment is "Worse battery than last years by a bit. But unless the M9 can blow me away with battery (which in all honesty I expect it to), I still think my next phone will be the S6 ^Edge?"

You're pushing shit uphill trying to impress most of the trolls here that Samsung can produce a good, well rounded device. 
I do admire your effort though!
 




 Interesting to note, however it's almost laughable my year and a half old phone will get to taste lollipop sooner than the newer phone I got 2 months ago..
 




 Just let Darwinism sort them out. 









 Indeed. 

A few select flagship varieties were upgraded first for influential markets to ensure people still bought the device, knowing it was going to be upgraded, however for the markets that they don't think people will buy a phone based upon the latest OS (smaller countries like NZ) they didn't bother releasing the latest ROM for.

(There's a website called "geekzone.co.nz" which allows the tech geeks from Vodafone/Telecom/2Degrees to chat with the users, and they've confirmed as of Feb they haven't even seen the latest Lollipop ROM for any S5's yet. 

So Samsung aren't just scattering them once they've been approved, they're not even bothering to release them to be tested by local carriers. 

Preeeety frustrating. 




 Fucking Censorship.  




 They've upgraded more of the very limited market S4 - i9506 devices to 5.0.1 (about 6 markets last I looked) than they have of my flavour of S5 - G900i (Just fucking 1 market.) So yes. Samsung are so unreliable with lollipop. 




 I love the first line " * Your old warranty is now void." yeah.. like you'd still have a warranty on a 5 year old phone :P 









 A little better than s4, but not by much, biggest benefit is water resistance. 
Camera is not that much better, fingerprint scanner is really awful, heart rate monitor is a piece of shit.  




 Interesting, thanks for clearing it was up. 









 That's kinda fascinating, any idea she was possible of this?  




 It's pretty fucked up. 

There are kinda two things you have to no morals to fuck with: charities and cancer. 









 But the s5 has the proprietary iso cell camera module making it more perplexing why they're shafting their customers.
 









 As an s5 owner all I really hope is they enable "pro shooting mode"on the S5 too, because ignoring the camera2 Api on the s5 lollipop and then releasing this feels like they're kneecapping the camera to make the s6 more appealing to camera enthusiasts. 




 Then I would say it's probably not a genuine screen, and if possible place it size by side with a genuine amoled, s3-s5 you'll quickly notice the difference. 

Also check out your screen options, you may have it on cinema, change it to dynamic?  




 Did you replace it with a cheap third party or genuine screen?  














 Could they suck from Samsung's teat any harder? Seriously.. 




 Good Night Sweet Prince. 




 That also works 




 They have their laws, we have ours. What I was attempting to draw is the fact that the laws are quite disparate despite the same crime. 




 Maybe a little. 




 FUCK NO. More highlighting the completely different approach the different countries have.
Yes, the amounts were significantly different, but this women was a repeat offender, and got off very lightly. 

Then when you compare to do something similar in Indonesia and the comparison is pretty fucked up. 




 Is there a reference I'm missing? 




 Same crime, but completely different attitudes. It's posted as a reflection to how out of whack the laws are. 









 Fucking racist cunts.  




 This is true. There's a final moral line between sucking off the ego of the device manufacturer, and providing an accurate and fair assessment of the device. 

Most review websites fail this moral test, and lean towards the former, and as you said - ensuring a steady and good income due to relieving further devices, not matter how many people they piss off due to them using their ego wank review as the basis to buy their next shiny toy, and then find out that actually the review didn't mention this fatal flaw which actually makes it a piece of shit.... 




 Thanks, just read the review. Most honest review I've read in a while, I loved how they specifically picked up on the awful screen which also plagued the original Flex device.

The funny (!) thing is I was utterly slammed on /r/android for picking this up on an early review of the G Glex2 after a youtube pre-release benchmark was released. I insinuated it was not an accurate test due to only running 1 benchmark at a time (and unknown cool down period between) and people left more than a couple of unsavory comments as a resut, so I think there are more than a few people who just don't want to know the truth sadly, and the review websites are pandering to this. 




 Right, I believe you, but no-one mentioned this on any reviews I saw, which makes sense as if I were Qualcomm I'd be careful curating news as well.  




 Reviews. Performance wise, it's not stellar, but reviews have not mentioned overheating. (Or none I have read anyway.)

If Samsung, Sony are having/had issues why is LG able to pump it a legitimate phone toting the 810 chip. Either the reviews experienced some serious heat issues and stayed quiet, or the issue isn't as big as everyone is making out to be? 

Don't get me wrong, I hate LG, but if they can make this SoC work, why can't anyone else?  




 How can the LG g flex do so well without overheating then?  




 Holy shit the Verge are like love sick puppies with their nose shoved so far up Apples ass they eat at the same time. This line made me fucking sick:

"Thats the same approach that Apple took when it expanded its iPhone lineup last year with some long overdue larger devices, and the ***payoff for that move was the biggest sales success in corporate history.***" 




 Can we stop calling her stupid?

I don't think she thought at all, you can't apply rational thought to someone in that scenario to be honest, your adrenaline takes over. Judge her all you like, but we have the benefit of hindsight. 




 Why would they bother? 

Pharmaceutical companies have squillions of dollars to fight any legislation and even go so far as to actively inventiveness doctors subscribing needless amounts of medication. 

I'm not saying it's not a problem, but it's just not worth it -not in the current political climate anyway. 




 Admittedly they've had some bad fucking luck, but surely shit like this should be picked up by routine checks? 

Any aircraft engineers care to weigh in? 




 Fucking cunt bag mother fuckers. NZ misses out again. Fuck you Google. you Magnificent fucking cunts. 




 I have to wonder how many parts of Android that most users never see, and never appreciate. For instance the (other than default) lock animations, or features they never knew existed like Face unlocking.

Has anyone ever seen you use your phone and gone WOW! and you've shown them their phone can do it too? 









 Don't know.. Nothing came up via Google, but you may honestly have to ask a Japanese historian. 









 HTC are barely treading water in the mobile market. Only so many people want a certain type of device.

Samsung have realised this, and done a more shot-gun approach of have a device for every piece, none particularly great, but adequate. This failed when their flag ship's sales weren't great. 

Oppo/One Plus have gone for cheap but good market, which is serving them well so far.

HTC have gone for the same market, 3 years running. You can only satisfy so many people in the world with 1 thing, before people start asking for alternatives.

Yes, their design **was** great, and won awards, but if they want to survive they either need Apple's iSheep affect to help the same thing, or they need to adapt.

They have not adapted by upgrading the Internal's, as one commenter on here mentioned, his 2 year old M7 is still more than adequate due to the chipset, so upgrading the internals is not adapting, as this isn't a very marketable changed this only serves to illustrate my point they have failed to innovate by upgrading their chipset with the same externals!

I mean people are arguing with me - saying that the people who bought their old device complained about certain features, which were then changes. 

So are you telling me HTC are marketing to the same people who buy their old devices? Again, they're going to/have already hit market saturation in some areas, so I was looking for some diversification from their design, or at least a better enhancement than a purely under the hood modification.  




 You're missing the point. But very well. 




 But I want an HTC with options.. In NZ the Mini isn't stocked by any major retail outlets, our options here are either a mid-range Desire, or the One. 

You're saying if you want a larger screen, go for a different manufacturer, from a marketability point of view that's an appalling attitude - we're not going to cater FOR any other market, other than the one we're been catering to for 3 years now. 

... Yeah, cause that's a sound business model. 




 I'm not arguing it was once a beautiful piece of kit, however consumers needs and demands change a lot over 3 years. As they don't release many other models (and certainly those don't tend to go to the same markets as the one does, they are making up consumers minds for them by saying this is the only screen size you need. Or this is the only design of phone you should ever want. 


That is arrogant. And as I mentioned, design awards aside people slammed Samsung for "evolution over revolution" with their devices, yet praise HTC for doing the same damn thing year after year? 

The review websites are very carefully avoiding mentioning the design copy paste. It's fucking hypocritical to the max and I'm so over the tall poppy syndrome. 

You tell me you aren't disappointed the same designers who made the original m7 have failed to improve upon their design in ***any way shape or form?*** 




 But  




 They've at least done consumers  a favor by increasing the screen size and pixel density for goodness sake! HTC have been arrogant shits and stubbornly kept the same size, same pixel density!  




 All I have to say: **it's the same fucking phone design for 3 fucking years!** 

***3 God damn years!***


That's just lazy and shitty. 




 I would argue, citing Samsung and Sony as two prime culprits who have done this - produced very similar looking devices year after year and they have subsequently had their mobile divisions post significant losses.

As the pundits loved to say about the S5 - "Evolution over Revolution" simply isn't enough to stay relevant in today's fast paced mobile industry.

A good example of this is Samsung - they are rapidly faced with losing their (once lion's) share of Android sales. 

Should your logic ring true the sames of the S5 was released with no major cosmetic changes (argueable of course) over the S4, sales tanked.

As a result, faced with a do or die situation (which may be overstating it..) they have done a complete about turn on two things which were once elemental to their design ethos - SD card and removable back panel.

People may have no design changes presented to them, however the market has shown it will not stand for it, and no manufacturer is totally immune from public opinion swaying against them if they feel like said manufacturer is merely using their brand name as a means to sell products. 

Of course I'd have to be a blind idiot to not realise it's not a significant part of the consumers purchasing decision. However, this is not, and I doubt ever will be the ultimate reason people chose 1 device over the other.

As a result they need a "catch" a reason to say "I'm going with manufacturer XYZ because I like their design ***and this new feature*** is what is making me buy their product.

HTC have unfortunately fallen into this, thinking they can get away with people buying their product purely because they're HTC. Correct me if I am wrong, but by producing the (mostly) ~~identical~~ same product for 3 years in a row is most certainly them telling the consumers "You don't need that extra special feature because ***I, HTC*** have made this."

As I mentioned earlier the only company who could pull this off is Apple. And HTC are as far from Apple as chalk and cheese.

However, if you have examples where you believe this may work, I am more than open for a good discussion! :)  




 For those supporting the move - the Snapdragon 615 is shat on by the 801.

[See GSMArena's review of the HTC Desire 820](http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_desire_820_dual_sim-review-1198p5.php)

Antutu: 27070 
vs E8  (Snapdragon 801) 46857

Yeah.. They are so utterly kneecapping the M8. There's no if, buts or maybe's.
 









 Actually he's quite correct - in NZ at least in Oct 2013 when the 5C and 5S were released. 
Facts and source below.

The iPhone5 was $800.

 Severely disappointed it's not an ISOCELL sensor, but clearly that either was a gimmick, or wasn't ready for version.2 in time?

Also such additions as motion tracking autofocus is extremely awesome.
 




 HTC are basically admitting they're fucking useless and suck ass at innovating, so they have to cheat by kneecapping their old phone in order to sell the new one.

They are admitting there's little reason for people to upgrade otherwise, and it's the fucking losers option to destroy the competition (their old phone) rather than produce a device which they know will sell on it's own merits. Because it won't, because it's a fucking clone of the previous 2 versions before it.

And furthermore, EVERYONE fucking bagged on Samsung for "evolution rather than revolution" with their S5 product, but HTC have done it for 3 years in a row, and everyone thinks they're fucking Gods. 

The phone industry are a bunch of fucking hypocrites with a severe case of tall poppy syndrome. 

This is what you've all created: The retarded child in the family who won't amount to anything because everyone keeps telling them they're doing a good job rather than telling them to do better. 




 Exactly, even they weren't stupid enough to think they could get away with the same shit. Again, HTC do it, and people think it's the best thing since sliced bread. I mean where the fuck is innovation? Innovation isn't using the damn processor as everyone else. Or using the same fucking camera sensor as everyone else, it's putting up new ideas, and actually standing by the choices you make. 

As HTC have shown however they are not innovators, they are fucking sheep who don't even have the balls to work on their ultra-pixel camera. And everyone is actually congratulating them for this phone!? And looking forward to it!?! The same crowd who called for Samsung's blood for daring to release the S5 which was "too similar to the S4" and yet here we have the SAME PHONE 3 years in a god damn row!

/rant./ 




 But everyone slammed Samsung for making a phone that remotely looked like the predecessor, however HTC do it and everything thinks it's God gift to the world. Fucking hypocrites.  




 Let's be honest here, most people already have a perfectly functional device, it's the WOW factor that makes people crave the latest.

Makers are slowly realizing they need a "Buy This MotherFucking Phone, It Will Make All The Girls Panties Drop at the mere site of your awesomeness."

One needn't look any further than Samsung thinking they could get away with largely a "Me too" phone with their Samsung S5. Not even ~~waterproofing~~ water resistance or a dodgy heart rate monitor could help the fact that the phone largely feels like a S4 in your hand. 

Potential owners need a flash factor, something that makes people go: "Wow, what's that phone?" It makes them feel good, and helps to avoid buyers regret.

However HTC have missed the boat entirely. If customers want a good HTC phone, they could very easily go with the M8 and not miss anything from the new version.

Put it this way: 

Your contract is up, you walk into TMobile, and go excellent, I can get a new phone!

How a layman sees it while looking at what phone to buy:

**Screen:**

* M7: 4.7 FHD

* M8: 4.7 FHD

* M9: 4.7 FHD

**Design:**

* M7: Aluminum unibody

* M8: Aluminum unibody

* M9: Aluminum unibody

**Operating system:**

* M7: Lollipop

* M8: Lollipop

* M9: Lollipop

**Speakers:**

* M7: Front Stereo

* M8: Front Stereo

* M9: Front Stereo

**Camera:** 

* M7: Takes photos

* M8: Takes photos

* M9: Takes photos

Why would you walk out of that store with a phone that looks and feels just like the 2 year old phone sitting next to it?.. 

Most people won't - they will turn to the Samsung for a larger screen, or Sony or Samsung for ~~waterproof~~ water resistance, or Huawei for a cheapie to tide them over. 

There's just no justification why most people with last year (or the year before) should upgrade to this model. 

Don't get me wrong, people will buy it, but there's zero WOW factor, and this will cost HTC sales to their competitors. 




 Yes. I thought it was so obvious I didn't bother putting /s. However I was wrong. 




 Very true. 

They really couldn't afford to rest on their laurels this year, and they don't have the Apple Effect^ to pump out a "S" version and think people will buy the new thing.

Same screen size as M8, same exterior as M8, same speakers (indifferent to most users) as M8, same interface with Lollipop as M8.. 

The users aren't going to notice (largely) a 'beneath the hood' CPU/GPU or RAM upgrade, as most aren't power users who benefit from alt+tabbing.

They needed to make current M7/M8 owners jealous, they have not succeeded.
 




 Samsung are losing significant market share in China and they can't afford to:

 Upvoted for the good memory. :) 




 I noticed the complete lack of OIS has been glossed over by bloody everyone.

As Sammy proved, even with a redesigned sensor (ISOCELL) you still need OIS backing it up for lowlight photos. It's a no brainer. 




 [This (and other sources)](http://www.amta.org.au/articles/amta/Brazil.Russia.India.and.China.emerging.middleclass.drives.extreme.mobiles.growth) show China as a new emerging market which isn't near saturation point for mobile growth yet. As a result Sammy have heavily leaned on Asian design culture for the S6 in a unbridled effort to grasp some of that newly available cash. 




 The West are a very well saturated market, the current expanding market is China. As a result they're pandering for an asian design taste rather than Western design taste. 




 the S5 has a fucking awful fingerprint scanner. How this got past quality assurance in the first place remains a mystery. 




 I think Apple are also eagerly licking their lips in preperation for the "looks like an iPhone6" law suits.. 




 I think a lot of people (Especially S5 owners) are feeling fucking jipped right now that Samsung COULD have pumped out something like this earlier, but didn't.
 




 Jesus. When he zooms in the quality looks like a hundred dollar point and shoot. 




 I have an s5 after a fortuitous insurance event after an s5 and can happily say they are so fucking alike it's not hard to see why sales tanked fucking hard. 

A better screen? No. 

Better battery? No, same screen on time. 

Better feel? No fucking creaky back panel. 

Better features? Fuck no! Unreliable heart rate monitor, and still too nervous to put anything worth a grand in a pool of water! 

Better phone? Fuck no. Not in any way shape or form. (And I used the s4 for a year for over 6 hours a day every day, so I'm more than an average user and if I cannot really justify this, can't expect most of your average Joe's to do so. 




 Eli5 why does north Korea come across as fucking crazy to westerners. Is their leader fucking nuts, or is there method to his madness?  




 They're like fucking children. No! I don't want anyone else playing with my things! Grow up.  




 We're so fucked. 




 Samsung unfortunately have a lot riding on this. But I fear they've done too much to please those who buy other phones regardless and bag on the Samsung brand than those who are actually loyal to them. 

Tl;dr pleasing the haters only to alienate your core fans = stupid stupid stupid. 




 Thanks, good tips.

My warranty forbids rooting unfortunately so I have to stick with the auto-adjust (which I only need to over-ride when showing old people photos!) black/dark backgrounds, and now using the night theme for Reddit Synch. 




 Yeah, suprising. Still one of the best resources though, obviously not something many people know enough or want to write about. 




 This does interest me, there's scant information real world available to layman who just wants to save a little bit of battery. 

I have an S5 and before than an S4, and on both devices struggling to hit more than 4 hours SOT. I would love to hit more without the need to resort to powersaving. (Where's the point in having a Ferrari while driving it like nanna?!) 




 Well, you don't have to change your wallpaper, to make a small change but still save significant amounts you could change your keyboard theme to a darker one instance 




 It's more small changes can make a big difference. I've changed the theme of Swype to "midnight" to be more dark as in working to get more than 4 hours screen on time on my s5.

Also just downloaded Reddit sync with an amoled dark theme, going to see if that helps. 









 I should also add have you tried scratching the contacts of your battery terminals?

Just with like a pin/knife gently scrape the 'knuckles' of the phonebattery terminals and the battery terminal pads themselves. 




 Just want to say it's nice to have an /r/galaxys4 "please help" post where the OP actually responds to questions! 




 So basically the greedy sons of bitches got told to fuck off? 




 Update: Sports mode has made a significant difference! Thanks /u//Bedk for the suggestion! 









 It's like a leprechaun is pissing on your hand. 









 I agree, and as mentioned I've got a d7000 50mm 18- 140mm however the best camera is the one you have on you at the time! I'll try fv5. Thanks!  









 I think outta around 80/20% 

80 = locals.. But they're targeted by campaigns constantly telling them they're driving like idiots.  




 Awesome! I'll just use sports mode from now. Thanks man, simple fix..  




 Good point, we really don't have the funding/money full stop to afford extra manpower/equipment etc to do this. 




 Yeah.. A bit!  




 Perhaps. I did in rarotonga, took 15 mins, happy to do it again. 




 Makes sense. To plead arrogance to such an infamous icon is a tad weird though.
 




 Couldn't agree more. I recently went to Dunedin, most of the trip was alright, but we got a lot of 130km/h in passing lanes, 80 every other time.. Dangerous overtaking etc.  




 You could find extremes like this in every scenario, regardless of whether they're a kiwi or not. 

Foreigners are however quite bad down south in comparison to the rest of the country. I can't recall stats, but they're not great. 

We have ad campaigns targeting our bad drivers, drink drivers, stoned drivers, tired drivers and angry drivers, but there's very little in the form of foreign driver campaigns. (They're are recently putting some in place, but I don't think it's widely advertised enough). 




 You misunderstand my statement, I mean we have no idea how they got their license, no idea if they walked into the testing station, drove around the block and were handed a license. 




 Why is that? The police/government are such hypocritical pricks.

They say "Driving is a privilege not a right." 

But then argue "You passed a potentially arbitrary driving test in a completely foreign country, with rather different road laws to New Zealand but yeah, of course you absolutely have the right to drive on NZ roads." 




 I saw that.. My heart goes out. I've driven that road recently, they would not have stood a snow balls chance in hell of avoiding a collision, and now that driver has to live with the fact he was in control of the wheel when that poor girl died. Just fucking tragic. 




 Thank you for providing some context to their actions. That's crazy.... 









 No, we should keep helping out elsewhere - like peacekeeping efforts to allow other countries to focus on ISIS etc. 




 Million (trillion?) dollar question. 




 Thank you for the suggestion It's not preinstalled, but I'll grab it from the Samsung store and just leave it in that mode 




 Sorry, yes, damn I should have picked that up. 




 Thank you, to the layman like me this didn't make sense, but your explanation provides sound reasoning. 




 Good point.  




 Pretty much this.

I talked to someone recently who'd read the Koran and he realised how utterly futile it is to try and reason with them, so what can you do? 

Can't kill an ideology, you can't reason with it and you can't change their beliefs. I don't think most people get this. 



















 I'm not envious of ARS at the moment, they have the unenviable moral dilemma of raising the profile of this, at the same time as letting potential attackers know who otherwise wouldn't have bothered/thought about using this to their advantage.  




 Hi /r/Android I just basically want to try and understand why Samsung have a hard-on for using rediculously low expsosure times on a hand-held camera.

I have a 6mth old child, so naturally he's always moving, and as I've recently upgraded to a Galaxy S5 over an S4 I was really looking forward to taking semi-decent quick exposure photos.

I've been horribly disappointed that basically the bloody camera defaults to an (obscenely low)1/33 for EVERY scenario and just alters to ISO to cope, except for extremely bright scenarios!

To back this claim up I've gone through my photos and summarized the settings the camera chose:

* In a well lit pool environment (Shutter 1/33 ISO250), 

* In a zoo on a sunny day (Shutter 1/33-1/110 ISO40-80), 

* At home with good natural light (Shutter: **1/17-1/20** ISO 320-100) 

* And out and about (Shutter **1/15** ISO400)

Even with an APS-C sensor D7000 with 50mm F2.2 fails to take decent photos at 1/17 hand held for goodness sake! And coupled with Samsung's utterly bullshit excuse for *software image stabilization* you just cannot use the damn camera for any sort of even partially low-light scenario with even slow moving objects!

To make matters worst I've taken photos with the iPhone5S and iPhone6 and noticed that..

* They take higher ISO photos.

* They have vastly superior software image stabilsation.

After having used the S4 *(which I usually didn't even bother to try and take quick photos on as it barely focus in anything other than perfect burn-your-retina bright sunlight)* for a year, I'm really disappointed in Samsung for doing very very little in the image stabilization department, I had hoped they would utilise the ISOCELL sensor to increase the shutter priority and allow for higher ISO's but this is simply not the case.

I will concede the focusing accuracy, especially in low-light is 99% better, but this is useless if you can focus on your item, but the resulting photos is ruined by the smallest quiver of your hand!

I'm stuck with the damn thing for now, but I just hope them to open the camera API and allow me to use smarter camera software to set higher shutter speed's or at least higher ISO's! 

**(It would appear the arrogant fuckheads have chosen to ignore the new API with Lollipop for now)**

Is there anything I should be doing differently? 

Is there a better Android camera fullstop which will produce faster photos? 

What do you think, am I just being a whiny little bitch? 




 Pulse was good until they decided LinkedIn was an awesome partner and changed the GUI dramatically and made a perfectly functional application into a an utter dog.

Took them many months to recover from that. 
























 Thank you, that's a good point, when they're like old and their kids google their parents this is going to come up and require a bit of explaining.. 




 Thank you, that wasn't explained very well. (Or at least i've only had 1 cup of coffee this morning..) 




 Sorry, does someone mind mind explaining this? - Did they "miss out" due to the injunction lapsing?  




 That's pretty average! 




 I agree, but in the same breath sometimes takes competing formats to determine the best winner for the consumer. However the obvious question is can such an 'alien' technology survive the invariable comparison between 2 proprietary formats? 

(As someone who sold blank DVD and DVD player/recorders during the DVD -R +R format can tell you, that was bloody confusing enough for consumers!) 




 Thanks Op! It's worth pointing out the halo around the lights could easily be caused by finger grease on the lens on the m8.  




 How do you miss this during the editing process?? 
I haven't come across this *yet.* 




 Yes! And that's made me think of another: A whole article on "user comments"! 

Let's let the users make up the click bait for us!?  




 I'm so not surprised though. Here's what I've noticed:

Spelling mistakes.

Advertising masquerading as "news articles" 
 
Extremely biased articles.
 
Very piss poorly researched articles. 
(Aka: people who abuse the party X when a quick Google forces to light they're actually lying through their teeth.)

Poorly executed articles. 
(Aka: look out for rampant  weed X which should be reported to MAF, but didn't bother to include a photo)

Any more examples anyone can think of?  




 Yes, that makes sense. 




 Maybe Samsung are betting upon this?  




 I hope someone like Anandtech takes the time to run a comparison. 




 Mint. I fingered one at the local telecom store, very light!  




 No, most users it will be fine. However this may be a purchasing decision some take into account.
However factor in 1 minute of 4k is around 1GB. So if you have some guy showing off to his mates and you're quickly going run out of room :-P
 




 Surprising really. I had a quick Google with A few different keyword variants with no hits. Even this was difficult to find. 




 Yeah, 9gb is quite a whack of data. In the same breath though 23gb should be adequate for "most" users. 




 Yes, (I believe so anyway) they release it in [gibibyte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibibyte) rather than gigabyte. 




 Yeah, the original news article stating users could do so was wrong (misinformed perhaps). 




 I would presume so?  




 Thanks for the comparison. But the note has an sd slot supporting sdxc so not that much of an issue.  




 I couldn't find a comparison with 32gb, but here's a link to show 16gb devices (from last year)

[This is the only 1 I could find. Oddly enough..](http://blogs.which.co.uk/technology/phones-3/phone-storage-compared-samsung-s4-still-in-last-place/) 




 The fact they're going retail in September is phenomenal. 

/r/Android users have speculated whether Ara would get if the ground, this company had gone way past that step. 


They must have realised there's a market for swappable hardware. 














 Indeed. From the looks of it it was almost identical!  









 This is gold! Oh HTC...

 Snap all the way man. (even after being bought by 2Degrees) Cancel your contract and move. 

I don't know if this helps man, but keep asking to talk to the manager. Be really nice and polite and just keep escalating. Tell them when the invariably say you can't - "That's absolutely fine, I understand you've told me I can't speak to a manager. I will hang up now and phone right back to attempt to speak to someone who is able to put me through to a position of power." I've had to use this a few times with Vodafone, works every time to get you through to someone who can help. Seriously. 




 Actually this reminds me of the (instant kiwi?) ad takeoff - the batsman puts something (his cup?) down and smacks it for six.

Anyone else remember this Ad? 




 Furthermore the mall indicated they had called it out over the loudspeakers for 30 minutes prior to towing it. So his story really doesn't add up. 









 As I dragged my Red bin to the curb last night it occurred to me it was probably 50% baby poo.
So there's that. 




 FTFY: "The team that got second best in the world for the first time ever." 




 Iris security would be nice. 









 Well spoken James. 




 Nice. 

Looks like a very well rounded device, they've addressed quite a few complaints about the S5 - speaker placement, camera quality, build quality, fingerprint scanner, heartrate monitor, TouchWiz GUI.

And just improved upon what makes Samsung devices really nice - Screen quality.

I'm sure they implemented some wizardry with the Exynos and the AMOLED as there was an article in /r/android last night fron Engadget a while ago. They implemented stuff like ignoring refreshing pixels that don't change based upon what's on the screen, which helped up to 10% better battery life on the S5, little doubt this has helped the battery last so long despite the bump in pixels on the S6.
 









 Seriously you need to taste this.. 




 I think most of it is conjencture. Who knows this could all be a enormous joke for more ratings?! /s/ Joking aside I'm sure he has enemies in the BBC who would love to see him gone, and this would not have helped his case in the slightest.  




 It really does, you're right. 

Funny how even though he really can be a thug, whether on purpose of because he has a fantastic PR assistance (probably both) he really is a loveable rogue really. 




 True. God. What have we created.. 




 I think you are right. God he must have one hell of an ego. 




 Yeah, he's allegedly said he will fight this, I presume so he can get a better exit package.
I daresay he will cream it from this?

But you're right, he's put his friends in a very tough spot. Is Top Gear bigger than Jeremy, or Jeremy bigger than Top gear? 




 He can be, but he's built up one hell of a very loyal following in his career. 

The question is will James and Richard follow through with their suggestion they will also leave? 




 Pretty much.. 














 That's some ballsy shit. 

Stabbed 16 times and still have the energy and intact mental facilities to be that quick witted, then to survive as well!?

 That's quite a novel idea. 




 I looked that up, but nothing came up so it must be a different phrase, but it figures there is even a phrase for stuff like that. 




 That makes sense. 
Thanks for the laugh too, I suppose that's actually half the issue - we're almost programmed to find most things to do with toilets amusing, which probably doesn't help.

 




 Indeed. 
Perhaps at this stage the majority of the audience doesn't want film/show makers to use them, and that's set the line in the sand. 




 For the record the commerce commission investigated SKY and basically determined that yes, while they have a monopoly they are acting lawfully as they are basically the only player on the block so can charge whatever they damn well want.

 Makes sense again for some shows, but I'm sure it could be used in some TV shows to great affect. 




 The school are totally within their rights to withdraw the little shits. A sports team **represent the school they are competing for** surely this gives the school the rights to be able to chose their representatives?


Can I point out [Rod Stewarts son did this in America and arrested for doing this a couple of days ago..](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3007112/Rod-Stewart-s-son-Sean-jail-bailed-charged-riding-luggage-carousel-restricted-area-Miami-International-Airport.html) So it's some serious shit they did, had they been older or perhaps not on a school trip chances are they would have been arrested and released with a warning at least. 




 I see what you did there.. :D 

No, your video games comment is fair enough, you don't expect such realism such video games (Can you imagine.. "Press A to take a piss")

But from gritty movies, i thought there would be more of a use to draw people into the realism? 




 That sounds like a reasonable explanation.  




 Is it too taboo? 

Or is there some sort of regulatory requirement that would make the shows PG+ when a toilet is mentioned, or shown?

Is it considered too low brow to mention anything toilet related in shows or movies?

Or perhaps it's done to simply speed things along?

What do people think? Should we have more realistic toilet behaviours displayed on our televisions and theatres? 




 That's a pretty shit phone review.

For a start  "As an example, with a day that was full of gaming and picture taking, the battery died just past the 10 hour mark." how completely unscientific can you be? Couldn't they at least posted SOT or battery stats of this?

And then in the "positives" putting "Battery life just above average" that doesn't sound like a positive to me.

And the camera review, what a fucking joke he didn't even clean the camera lens, you can tell by the massive light ghosting in the bar shots there's grease on the lens.

Feels like this phone was handed to someone who's owned a few smart phones, felt like they were a pro in reviewing and went to the bar, had a few beers and wrote this up in an hour or two.

Not impressed. 




 But why would we feel bad?

They are still the only aluminium and glass high end phone available in most markets, why change what works?
The reviews for the latest device aren't anywhere near as scathing as the S5 reviews (Remember everyone's favourite catchup for bagging the S5? -"Evolution over revolution") so while it's not the best move they played it safe.

They may not have Samsung's mega dollars to be able to release an entirely new device within the short life cycle that people are coming to expect from cellphone makers these days, and why would they?
The market responded [favourably](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=2498.TW#symbol=2498.TW;range=) to the move, so actually they've done quite well. 




 Well said. 




 Hold on there, I'm not talking an escalator- I'm talking a luggage carousel - you know the type that the baggage handlers put the luggage on. 

For a start [they can easily trap fingers and hands](http://www.philstar.com/metro/2013/08/12/1079731/naia-worker-gets-hand-stuck-baggage-conveyor) and then they took it through to an OSH and security nightmare, that provides direct access to the tarmac. At every airport I've ever been there are signs saying don't ride the carousel, and don't go through the curtain.. 

I would expect a 5 year old to do this, not a ***16 and 17 years old*** 









 Makes sense. I guess if you have enough money time doesn't really factor in to things as much as I thought they did. 




 Doing it when you've been explicitly told not to do anything stupid due to what happened last year- Last year the group burned a shape of a penis in the ground, trashed the joint they were staying, and burnt "SBC" in the ground.

So to further horse around and they knew the school wasn't going to take it lightly. 




 Yes, purely based upon previous observation.
However, now the reviews have come out, peoples tone has changed significantly. 




 It wasn't in the beginning.
I think it got worse after the rest of the reviews came out.... 




 Thank you. Truly thank you.
This really surprises me I would not have thought 1 year even from conception to product would be nearly enough time!

If I could afford to I would guild you for being the only person to back up what you're saying with some background knowledge.

Radically different takes 2 years - so you reckon the S6 edge has been in the works for 2 years? Or were they just eye watering quick at the R D for it?  




 Why? 

How long does it take then? 

Do you know for 100% certain it only takes 1 year?

Why are you assuming they can do it quicker?

Edit: Call me delusional but no have no proof backing it up? Proof provided. 




 That makes sense.
I was going off what I know, and what I presumed to me *should* take that long. Why so many people took it upon themselves to hate me for it is so utterly beyond me. 

Without anyone able who knows the process we may never know for certain.
 




 Then that was my bad.  




 Not sure if you're being sarcastic? 

..They are assholes...

They knowingly took it upon themselves to enter an area that was off limits while representing a school they attend. 
At the very least they had no thoughts for how this might reflect upon the school, let alone the poor teacher/aide who was suppose to be watching them.

Let's say, worst case scenario from their little trip- they could have shut the whole fucking airport down for 30 minutes inconveniencing hundreds of people. 

They are Assholes for being inconsiderate little pricks for the purpose of thirty seconds of personal amusement.  




 Frustrated that people clearly don't realize how long HTC have been working on this phone, and that compounds my level of disappointment in them for fucking it up. 









 Thank you. Prepare your Asshole for the downvotes, but you are sooooo right. 




 This isn't "catastrophic" but it is a joke.

The S6 uses both the CPU and storage speed boost for really nifty things like increasing the camera boot time to allow you to open it very quickly with only a couple taps of the home button. 
A slower processor and this would not be possible.

Also the mobile industry falls heavily upon benchmarks, and graphs to show better phone, the majority of people never really play with their flash new device for any more than a few minutes in stores, so rely on the internet to prove why it should buy 1 device over another.

A difference of 23000 *benchmark* points most certainly will pull those with no brand loyalty to the faster device. 

There is no other draw card HTC have here. (And don't you dare mention design, if they wanted design they would have already bought the M8 over the S5. You can't panda to the same audience for 3 years running (aluminium and glass) without nearing the saturation point in a lot of markets. 

HTC needed a "Wow factor" and this chipset is not it. 




 I'm loving the denial in this thread:

"It's not going to make a shit phone, it's an awesome phone, it's **just** running a shit processor."

"It's not going to be any slower than a Samsung S6, benchmarks don't mean anything in the real world."

"They didn't throttle the chip, it's just software tweaks."

HTC have had YEARS to play with the 810.. (Seriously, phone development takes at least 2+ years from drawing board to anything close to fruition. Even when you're only tweaking the previous iteration)

And this is the *best* they could come up with!?

Go on, downvote me, you know damn well I'm right. 




 Yes, a very accurate title there, "Timeless design" as it's same god damn design every time you look at it! 




 Yeah.. He completely and utterly ignores the fact consumers are clamouring for bigger, brighter, more pixel dense screens, while also screaming for faster, more powerful processors all while browsing Facebook.

Battery technology  Average consumer demands 




 Yay for a Government which allows this! /S

 This headline makes me happy.

 Oh I wonder who could  be behind this... /s 




 Yeah. You've pretty much got it.  




 *Slow clap* 
























 Perhaps this will succeed for the same reason as custom pc's (alienware, home built etc) still exist in a world of computer/laptop companies like Dell, Lenovo, HP etc. 
 




 No, somewhat unbelievably.

I bought a new battery which actually got worse SOT, then realised it was for an i9505, not an i9506, even then I got 3 hours SOT.  




 I now understand why in Far Cry 4 they ask you like 5 times if you're sure want to fight the Honey Badger.. 




 I would disagree, I reliably got 12 hours standby + 4 hours SOT with my S4. 
And by reliably I mean for 6 plus months this was my consistant benchmark. 
If I got less than that I knew and hunted down the Application responsible.

When it dropped consistantly to 3 hours SOT plus 12 hours standby I did a factory reset and that took it back up to 4 hours.. So the key to any good measure is reliability, SOT is able to be a reliable benchmark. 




 As would I, the frustration however arises from when minorities are allowed concessions that the majority does not feel are warranted by their requirements, or religious beliefs.

This potentially stems from a few things:

* Misunderstanding the core religious laws which require consumer law to be changed in order to comply. 
* Frustration at the laws passed for religious reasons that allow a religious person a significant concession while still applying the same law heavily upon non-believers.

Surely you can understand the frustration when one must relinquish their tweezers, while a potentially sharp metal object designed to protect oneself is allowed on board without question due to ones religious beliefs. 




 Thank you, that makes sense, as mentioned above I had 3 lemonade mixed with flavoured vodka, the end of each drink was significantly more bitter/tart tasting than the rest of the drink. So what you're saying makes sense. 

Thank you kind redditor for your response, I'lll use a cosy next time to drink the drink cooler to avoid the bitterness! 




 Thank you very much, I was drinking lemonade with feijoa flavored Vodka, the last gulp of all 3 drinks were quite bitter compared to the remainder of the drink. 

I thought it was due to the ethanol sinking to the bottom of the water, but thank you for explaining it's mixed throughout the drink. I think in my particular circumstance /u/MoltenSlag has hit the nail on head in that it's due to the fizzy escaping the drink, coupled with a rise in temperature, makes sense.

Thank you kind redditor for your reply. :) 




 Yup, you can only park on your side of the road, not against oncoming traffic. 

Also this:

Except instead of going into their own lane, everyone will go into the lane furtherest away.  









 No worries! Really love showing off nz to the world, we have stunning scenery, and if you're a night owl the most picturesque impossibly clear night skies imaginable. Especially in the lower south island.

Oh one more thing, while it's legal for 2 drivers to turn left and right respectively into a multi laned road (each turn into road path nearest to them) most drivers cut wide and turn into the other lane, so best to only go if you're certain they will turn into their lane. Sorry if that doesn't make sense I can draw you something.  




 Well.. There have been shit battery figures quoted and thermal issues, hopefully fix the thermal issues and battery life may increase?  




 Does anyone need to be reminded of the bloody Adidas All black jersey debacle? Rebel were selling the All Blacks Jersey for $220 NZD despite the fact it could be bought online for half that, the supplier- Adidas refused to back down on having a ludicrously high cost price and basically told kiwis you will pay what I fucking want to charge you cunts. No shut up and give me your money.

[Adidas New Zealand refuses to reduce its wholesale price of the All Blacks jersey but says the move by retailers to reduce their price is "good for consumers".](http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/rugby-world-cup/5411809/Adidas-gets-a-mauling-over-All-Blacks-jersey)

[More sauce.](http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/rugby-world-cup/5411809/Adidas-gets-a-mauling-over-All-Blacks-jersey) 




 Good to hear! :) 




 Don't know, but I sometimes have to be the asshole that taps their brakes and makes the dude behind them brake hard.

For the record, 99% of the time this results in them realizing they're too close and backing off, so I suspect they're driving on autopilot, and it takes manual control (braking to avoid hitting me) to make them realize they're driving like a douche and back off. 




 I'll always upvote Bender quotes. 




 Indeed. All things considered though, actually putting it past parliament is a major hurdle.   




 Don't think so......... 




 Haha, good point! 









 Too true - reminds me of a apt quote worth keeping in mind - 
"If something is free, you're the product." 




 Couldn't agree more to be honest. I drive from Bishopdale to Riccarton and back twice a day and if I had a dollar for every red light runner, every stop sign runner, every speeder or every queue jumper (using the right hand lane to jump 2 cars ahead despite free flowing traffic.) then I would not be typing this, cause I'd be a on a fucking boat in the Bahama's somewhere sipping a mojito. 




 Haha, if enough people can make "Jedi" the religion on an NZ census I'm sure you can get away with this. 




 We have deceptive times on Google between major landmarks, allow +1 hour for most journeys on your GPS.

Most of our motorways out of the major arterial routes are unlit, unpoliced and barely maintained so require constant vigilance. 

We do sometimes have wandering livestock, but not very often.

And unfortunately you have to contend with the average Kiwi Driver who greatly over estimates their driving abilities. 

Basic rules to be mindful of: 

* Do NOT expect people to stop at STOP signs.
* Do not EVER expect people will see you on the road.
* Expect pedestrians to not look before stepping out on the road. 
* Expect drivers to not hear your horn (wearing headphones while driving is a common passtime.)
* Do not expect to just 'find a park' any where, at any point in time, always give +10 minutes to find a park in most central areas.
* Expect drivers to tailgate badly (Seriously, NZ drivers love acting like the human equivalent of hemorrhoids. 
* Expect drivers will speed up during passing lanes (120+km/h)
* Further to the above expect drivers to be driving slowly on the motorway (80-90km/h)
* Do no expect drivers to indicate
* Expect drivers to pull out without looking 
* When approaching a T intersection expect cars coming around the corner to cut into your lane
* Basically expect dangerously
* Not obeying Stop signs, Give way signs, or any kind of sign for that matter
* Driving dangerous driving at all times. 
* Be surprised when Drivers obey the road rules
* Etc..

Edit: I'm from Chch and I encounter the above on a daily basis and I only travel about an hour or around 35km a day. 




 If the people grabbing the keys are indiscriminately grabbing them from extremely bad drivers, why hasn't anyone grabbed the keys from a NZ'er yet?

Edit: I am allowing for the possiblity this does or has occured and no-one's reported it? 




 Oh I see - he checked the wrong side first? Kinda makes sense - throw in an unknown environment, I think we can both agree it just makes for a recipe for disaster.. 




 Gimmicks? So you're happy with the same technology being used for many years with no enhancement, no refinement, no changes from a 15 year old design?

Yes, they re expensive, so is R D. He could pump out the same old shit as everyone else at the same price as everyone else, but instead he pays vast sums of cash to engineers to do make it better. 

While you agree or disagree with him as a man, you have to appreciate someone who looks at an age old design and tells themselves "I can do this better." 




 Indeed. 




 I agree with your point, although even your example has a tinge of arrogance - only looking one way when we're all taught to look both ways regardless.

If your assessment is correct, and complacency and drivers revert to a 'comfortable' level of driving on our roads then I can't help but wonder how/if we can even approach this from an education standpoint, I guess the arrows on the road are a good step, but a quick test (as many propose) would quickly become a distant memory when passing the 15th dead possum on the road from Nelson to Twizel, rendering any skills learnt at arrival void as one slips back to their standard routine.

How can you even stop this? I honestly don't think you can. (Except for the billboards advising tired drivers etc to pull over - but if they can't read English or have a tight schedule they won't care?) 




 Just attempting to curry favour with the Sikh population perhaps? 
























 When you have to factor in..

* Travel cost to get equipment to site.
* Hire price for the machines to rip it up, re seal it, smooth it over etc.
    * A machine to rip up old road
    * A machine to lay new seal
    * A machine to lay new arreggrate
    * A machine to smooth it all down
    * **Not sure if you can get 1 machine to do multiple jobs?**
* Getting council approval to take road.
* OSH precautions - Road cone's diversion plans.
* Advertising may be required if it's a main state HW - so cost of hiring a fuckoff sign for a week or two.
* Cost of 5+ staff perhaps.
* Cost of clean up (dumping waste etc.)
* Cost of tar seal.
* Cost of rock aggregate.
* Cost of portaloo for time period needed.

From seeing it done a few times, depending on damage.. 
They would need to:

* Dig up X amount off road
* Lay new substrate
* Lay new tar seal and chip it

Or at least that's my extremely layman's point of view, but I'm sure you wouldn't get much change from a 80-100K $ per KM. And then you factor in redoing the bridge, this will be signifcantly higher due to probably needing to shut down the bridge/have a stop/go so probably nearer $300-400k per KM

Edit: he's recording for at least say 3minutes using this [distance calculator website cause I'm lazy..](http://www.machinehead-software.co.uk/bike/speed_distance_time_calc.html) and he's travelling at 90km/h for the entire trip, say 2minutes at 90km/h = 3kms.

So to answer your question, I would hazard a guess of around (at least) $1,000,000+ to redo the road the fucktard ripped up. 









 Ok,  let's look at meridian energy for instance. 

They generate energy which pays dividends to the government and private corporations. 
These dividends are supported by worth and profit.
To maintain their worth they must generate a X amount of profit.
They get profit from selling energy to consumers.
An extra charge (say to Maori for water rights) eats into the profit, which means they have to charge you and I more to maintain the same worth, and continue to pay dividends.

So essentially you and I will be paying more, which will be subsiding the water payment.

So again, I pay a amount which goes to government which they use to better the entire country.
If they are successful I will pay more money which will only benefit Maori.

How is this fair? 

Again I understand if the water was Tapu, or they simply want more money, and you and I will be paying for it.

 




 Preparing for the bashing here, but seriously over this fucking profit grab.

Unlike the money which is currently gathered for water rights us used by all kiwi under say the local council who charge for the usage rights, this money will go to exclusive rights to the Maori. 

How is that not racist in it's own rights? "I don't want everyday NZ'ers to benefit from the water, I want ONLY Maori to benefit from the water use." Fuck That Shit.

Edit: if you're going to downvote me, tell me why I'm wrong.
I understand the Treaty of Waitangi, I understand Maori have rights to the LAND which was taken from them, but water is a renewable resource, it's not Tapu, how can they claim rights to be able to sell it off and make the profit from it? And take profit away from everyday NZ'ers? 




 Protips: 
Add +1 hour to almost all Google City-city trips.

Don't take the main highways if you're not in a rush.

West coast anywhere = must visit.

Put the camera down, and just take in the sights without a viewfinder in front of your face.

If you're from a major city, take a walk at midnight/1am basically anywhere from the main centres = More stars than you've ever likely seen anywhere else in your life.

 I should have known something that had been gilded that many times, but wasn't the top story was something really fishy! 




 You Sir are a legend. 




 "I quit my job to earn less to avoid paying money to help my children" would make a much more accurate Stuff article. But no, it's all governments fault. /s 




 Nah man you've missed the point - just a lot of bad stories about German tourists. You don't hear of other nationalities stealing returned camper vans, or camping out in red zone houses or pulling knives on people.
I don't know why they're all Germans, but it's just not a good look. 




 To explain my headline:

* German tourists pulled knife on a reporter when he approached them in New Brighton while they were covering a piece on freedom camping.
* German tourists camped out in a Redzone house last year, shitting all over the place.
* German tourists told there are easy pickings in tourists returning camper vans to Chch Airport (implying it's been done numerous times before). 



















 This sounds like a piss take surely.  









 Thanks for the update, good luck to you both. 
It's stressful enough losing an income without this on top. 

Just keep a recording/write down everything that happens so as little as possible can be disputed should it go that far.

Put it this way, I got hit by a car recently, they disputed they were at fault. I had a dash cam recording as proof so insurance waived excess immediately. :) 




 English is not my forte. 




 God damn grammar fail. Re-read it like 5 times too. Fuck it. 




 Ironically if you ever did that to a sheep while you're shearing it you would probably be shot on sight. 














 To be honest they are probably relying on you giving up and going away. 

The trouble is if the assholes are going to do it to you, chances are they will try it on with someone else, so fully don't give up.

By seeking legal advice you could let them know you're playing hard ball, which could be enough to scare them into paying without any further fuss. 

I'm not sure were you are, but here's a [Free phone Canterbury Law advice helpline](http://www.canlaw.org.nz/legal-info-by-phone)

[Or find your local community law centre](http://www.communitylaw.org.nz/your-local-centre/find-a-community-law-centre/)

Edit: ensure ALL your correspondence with them is captured, if you phone them put them on speaker and have another phone recording them. Of course tell them: "For complete disclosure, this call is being recorded and may be used should this matter have to go to court." it might seem like a dick move, but if it's your word against theirs don't make their life any easier.

 What kind of tokens do you find? 




 Buzzbars are also good frozen if you can get your hands on one! 









 My hat off to you. How do you cope without wanting to give the little buggers a good smack? 




 Really? Did not know that. As I said it's very well tinted windows. God that must be a boring job. 




 Nah, it's a dedicated speed camera. (Dark blue van with camera sticking out the rear heavily tinted window.)

But that does raise a good point, now this could be because I see a very censored view of NZ policing via police television shows, but I see your point in that if someone is doing 1 thing dodgy, chances are likely they're also doing other stupid shit - like if they're not wearing their seatbelt, they could have an unrego'd car or something. Again, that's just from seeing TV shows, but it confirms your theory of if someone looks dodge, it's cause they are? 




 For the record (and yes, I've never had a speeding ticket so can throw  stones. (for now again)) most speedo's are calibrated to +2-3km/h at 50km/h and +4-7km/h at 100km/h.

So if you were stupid enough to drive with your needle above the +5km mark, you're going to get caught. 

Drive at 50-55km/h and you're going to get lasered at 48-53km/h no problems. 

Source = my driving past the concealed fuckers down Fendalton road in Chch every morning. 




 So basically, target the people who drink in moderation and who probably WILL PAY to avoid a conviction than increase the charges for those who drink to excess and WHO FUCKING DON'T PAY anyway?  

Fucking GENIUS! I bet the politician who thought this up while playing golf on a Wednesday morning got a massive pay rise. 




 Actually totally agree with you. It's fucking hardcore bullshit our pussy ass politicians target mum and dad enjoying a wine with dinner while refusing to man up and increase the punishment for the hardcore recidivist drink drivers.

If you drink and and drive once with quite a few on board = cash and demerits.
Again = cash and demerits.
Again cash and and demerits.

The definition of stupidity is doing exactly the same thing and expecting the same result. Stupid fuckers are going to be stupid fuckers. 

Demerits? They'll drive anyway. Thanks to under staffed police they're willing to risk it.

Fines? fuck it - throw it on my tab! Then when it grows too big, the court inevitably sentence them to a hundred hours or so community detention. Which if you work it out for some of the worst offenders, they are essentially being paid at a rate of a FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS AN HOUR? It's a fucking joke.

 So SKY, Mediaworks and TVNZ (TV1, TV2, TV3, TV4 and Prime) are all pissedoff we can get..

* Faster Content. 
NZ can wait *years* for Movies and TV shows etc to come to TV!

* More convenience to watch what we want. When we want. 
Instead of subscribing to some shitty unreliable expensive HDD recorder, or paying money to still have advertising anyway we can download and watch them them on any TV or mobile device whenever/wherever we want!

* Easier: Again without DRM restrictions, it's a "Hey mate, here's a flash drive with the latest GoT episode".

* Cheaper: Sky increased their prices recently, the Commerce Commission investigated and basically said "Sky are a monopoly and can charge whatever they want." (I'm not kidding.)

* Access to just soooo much more content than **anyone** can offer NZ consumers. 

So tell me where's the draw card for going through the piss poor selection available to NZ buyers? You've provided a poor service, years too late, and for way to much money. Then you bitch about it?

They can charge as much as they want, but unless the market things it's a fair deal it ain't going to happen. 




 Fuckin' Genius. 




 Indeed. However we're way too lenient on "shit cunt" drivers in court. So there's very little to stop the stupendous amount of recidivist "shit cunts".  




 They specifically touted "Zero" tolerance over the Xmas break, which failed epically. 

It would good be for a police person to confirm, but I've seen most cars not get caught at 5-7km/h so I can only presume they're lowering the tolerance to only 4km/h and will be more vigilant in pulling you over/issuing a fine? 




 Hi /r/NewZealand,

Neighbourly.co.nz is a Fairfax run community congregation website designed to help connect neighbours communicate and keep in touch about local events and goings on. 

Local area events like:

* BBQ's 
* Work wanted
* Local fairs
* Garage sales
* Community events like Street Parties
Etc.

This is all dependent upon local involvement, obviously someone needs to post these events, but as it's been out for a wee while now, and thanks to advertising drives it is getting more and more popular, so while there may not be much happening in your area it's worth sticking with it. 

My sister in Wellington really waxed lyrical about it so thought it was worth a go so I signed up recently and was quite surprised with the amount of people in my area using it. 

Depending on your local politician and police involvement you can also receive alerts like local burgarlies and political speaking events in your area as well.

When you sign up initially you can gain immediate access by supplying a cellphone number, but you do have limited interaction until you receive a letter by post containing your verification code as to confirm your identity and your local area. This can take a wee while. 




 The key to driving in ~~Nelson~~ anywhere in the South Island is assuming that no one knows what the fuck they are doing at any given moment, and to drive as if everyone is poised to kill you.

 Reading the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lundy_murders) the whole affair is actually horribly hilarious in a cruel and twisted way.

Mark was found guilty in 2002. 

Sentenced to Life, minimum non-parole of 17 years.

He then appealed and this was increased to a non-parole of 20 years.

He then appealed again, and was immediately sentenced to 20 years non-parole.

**He's been found guilty THREE TIMES**

He was eligible to get out in 2019 had he been a good prisoner. Now he can't get out 'til 2022. And I wonder if the fact he still maintains his innocence will count against him in his parole hearings? 




 No tax bill in NZ. :)

 I couldn't find any news articles so I've had to take a screenshot: http://imgur.com/NnP0IXz

I'm in the Facebook [Beta program](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/introducing-the-facebook-for-android-beta-testing-program/10151529228878920) so not sure when it roll it fully, or ever at all depending on stability feedback. 









 Hence why I didn't link it.. :-D it's really a non story though.. I'm sure the journalist who wrote it will get a raise.. 




 Yes, messaging her over Facebook for goodness sake. They would have instantly made her day significantly shit. 




 No such thing as bad publicity eh? 




 Given what a significant difference lights have made on the intersection of Idris/Glandovey I'd be pretty happy about lights instead of that god forsaken roundabout. 









 I thought it rather ironic.  









 Well said. 









 The issue is there's precious other resources which have localised news. 

There's [The Scoop](http://www.scoop.co.nz/) which is alright, but being 'dependent' doesn't mean they don't put their own spin on things.  




 Retail workers get very little 'normal' time off, so those precious few days are novocaine for our souls. 




 But when it's been 2 months, the majority of the feedback I saw last time this was brought up it was also "just let it die for goodness sake" I think they've gone too far this time. 









 Indeed. 2 months is a long time, clearly the poor girl thought it had blown over enough for her to reactivate her Facebook. 
I reckon it's a tad cruel to potentially reignite it all by having it as a headline on The Press and Stuff. 




 Headline article on Stuff.co.nz is the girl 'caught' by voyeurs at the pub with her pants down with her boss (?) is leaving for the UK. 

The 'journalists' have been seemingly monitoring her Facebook account, noticed she reactivated it, and attempted to message her about the whole affair.

I'm not giving them satisfaction of more clicks, the link is available on Stuff.co.nz if you so please

 When you're drunk you're the most honest I suppose.
Hassling the opponents for the purpose of upsetting their psyche is definitely in the rule book.

I think the significant contrast in attitudes to sportsmanship behaviour while on the field between the 2 sides is well known and his comment just highlights this.

I think that's what's probably making this worst than it first sounds.    




 For instance:

* Are those fuel injectors that "clean and protect" worth it?
* Is higher than 91 octane better for your car?
* Is it worth cleaning/replacing your spark plugs or air filter?
* Do you recommend changing the oil every X months?
* Do engines really get build up if they're only ever driven about around town? (Aka: low revs/speed.)
 




 If his comment was meant in jest it's still a fucking uncomfortable thing to say. 




 Indeed. As someone from my FB feed said: It speaks a lot to your character that someone acting nice around makes you so uncomfortable you feel the need to be mean back. 









 The simple fact is from an economic perspective we need the money that foreign oil and gas exploration brings in. 

The only thing we can keep doing is keep reporting this kind of stuff and sign petitions to ensure there's minimal impact to the local flora and fauna (if onshore) and minimal disruption to our marine environment (if offshore.) 

Yes I would amazing if the world could suddenly perform an about turn and stop using oil etc, but the simple fact is that isn't going to happen for a few years. 

In the meantime we need to be smart about how we whore out our natural resources.

* They have some 350 souls entirely trusting these 2 men with their lives.

* The pilots always have 1 ear out listening to ground control 
* They have another ear listening other aircraft.
* And another listening for the other pilot.
* They also have are listening for error alerts.
* Both eyes are constantly scanning their instrument panel.
* Both eyes are constantly scanning the horizon to orientate themselves and look for danger
* And they're gripping the yoke tightly with both hands.

Yeah, there's a good reason why being an airline pilot is [rated as one of the worlds most stressful jobs.](http://www.careercast.com/slide/most-stressful-jobs-2015-4-airline-pilot)


And you think you should avoid going to jail for a very long time for attempting to blind them while they're doing all of this? While they're tasking with ensuring mums, dads, sisters, brothers aunts and uncle all can land safely? 

Please tell me more...
 




 I have to disagree with you there, it will put other like-minded idiots off doing it.  




 No, he's been well versed in the art of talking bullshit 




 In the immortal words of Bender Rodriguez:
[Yup, we're boned.](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/9a/9a32b5fd2e96017c9d8f02162b2fb06caaa83327da49a61274dcba6af038d7d3.jpg) 




 Oh lordy. He needs to repeat this to himself each morning:

**Sometimes it's better to shut up and look stupid than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.** 




 Good point. I had forgotten that little attention seeking outburst. 









 Honestly had no idea (but I don't watch that shit anyway) he was being "exploited". So i googled his name and xfactor only this news article comes up, so I kinda have to ask now after this has gone viral, who's exploiting who?  




 Rude.  




 Failing to see why it's the staff's responsibility to keep track of a grown man. 

I'm sure the Interislander is damned if it does, and damned if it doesn't. The only way I can see to stop this happening is to ensure you hold a ticket of sorts which is stamped and crossed off vs a passenger list when you leave. (I haven't use the service but presume this isn't happening.) so while they could enact such a measure valid travelers would be severely inconvenienced by this.

And further more, by the time it reaches the destination, chances are (if he disembarked early enough) he'll be swept far out to sea.

I understand the Widow is pissed off and wants to blame someone, but at what point do we have to say shit, there's no point blaming the company as any measures taken to avoid such accidents are just pointless given if someone ultimately wants to kill themselves they will circumnavigate any measures put in place. 









 Some people need more copper in their diet. For this person, it would be wrapped around lead. 




 Cider also works! It should last and be a bit fizzy, and it's a unique gift  




 Are they a beer fan at all? Find one of your best local drop to bring over, should make it quarantine in your stowed luggage?  
























 It's pretty appalling, there's zero evidence of any scientific investigation that the Antarctic can sustain this method of fishing whatsoever, and may ultimately decimate the krill population in these areas for decades.

Of course this isn't known for certain, but there is a balance, between krill population and predators, and humans are proposing to severely disrupt that balance for what? Animal food and omega3 tablets? Awesome. 




 I agree the Comcom are partly to blame here for allowing them to do this, Orion are being greedy fucks to begin with, and lying to the Comcom didn't help - they argued the increase was needed to pay for Quake damaged infrastructure, taking on more debt to pay out a $80M dividend I would take at odds to propping up the infrastructure? Hence my frustration at Orion, not the Comcom. 




 They do, but they didn't request the price rise, Orion did. I took your comment like it was the comcom who set the price independent from Orion. 




 Sorry you're wrong there, see TVNZ article from 2013:
[Orion New Zealand Ltd has asked the Commerce Commission if it can increase its prices by 15% or around $8.50 per month for an average customer.](http://tvnz.co.nz/business-news/orion-proposes-power-price-hike-5533171) The ComCom did however strike this down and proposed a smaller 8.4% instead. 




 No, I did not make myself clear -  quite the opposite I wonder if they had pay deducted for not getting through a set amount? 

As your comment is apt - the general attitude is at odds with their pay rate. 




 Judging the way things were run by the arrogant fucktards paid by EQC (who by the way were paid like $75 **per hour**) I'd bet my left nut there was a financial incentive (or penalty) for getting through as many houses as quick as possible. 




 Family friends had a run in with this cuntbag, he had a smug fucking "I am God" attitude. Didn't even look at the fucking house, take measurements, just eyeballed it and said the infamous "This isn't earthquake damage!" Made them feel like criminal just for lodging a claim. They appealed and got their own engineer to take a look. In limbo last I heard.

From my understanding, this is the guy they bring in to browbeat people into submission. Fucking sheer arrogance personified.

Honestly hope he burns in hell for the shit he's put the chch through. 




 Eh? 









 Treating the justice system like a pick and mix isn't how it's to be used. 

It's not like he hasn't had his day to plead his case, he's had 2 appeals and 2 trials already. Both if which would have cost millions. 

Edit: [cost over 2 million dollars so far and expected to rise..](http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/67584570/cost-of-defending-mark-lundy-over-2-million) 




 Fucking sick of taxpayers dollars being wasted on this shit. 




 Thanks man 




 Hardware or software wise? 

Hardware wise: uv detector, iris based security, gesture detection, holographic display, blood sugar detector. 

Software based: obviously better ui's to make use of holographic displays, deep integration of encryption, biometric based website authorization. 

Maybe. 




 In after "I fucking wish!@#$" 









 Use clean master to delete app cache, I got the same problem recently "there is insufficient space on the device"?  




 Your battery could be stuffed. Try a mates battery? (if possible?) 
Try scratching your battery contacts with a sharp knife/pin?  




 A few things:

Glass screen protector is a must.

Buy a usb 3 cable as (at least for me) it didn't come with one in the box, which literally defies the point of having it..

To save battery life don't forget to disable "Samsung push service" and disable "auto update" in the Samsung app store, or it will reinstall itself.

Um.. If you're not used to using an amoled screen, I use Reddit sync with the specifically designed amoled theme (it's quite dark) which saves a considerable amount of battery life.

That's all for now off the top of my head.
Enjoy your new device!  




 That is the true tragedy indeed. 
Edit: did more research, and realized I was ignorant myself. Edited comment. 




 Disrespectful cuntbags. How fucking arrogant could you be? Fuck. 

They have no idea what so ever how hard life was for these soldiers, who were young, and died horribly. They deserve significantly more respect than this.

Send these fucktards to the front line in Afghanistan, no bullet proof vests, a full clip and the shirt on their back.

Then let them come back once they realize what respect for your fallen countrymen actually means. 




 Yar, when the red tide's a flowing, we go around to Brown's bay. 




 Did a doubt take, this belongs on /r/nottheonion 




 I know right - Getting your own money back from the IRD?! That's stupid talk that's what that is.. 




 YAY! Less money to the IRD more money in your pocket.. In many years time.. 




 Thanks! 




 Why? 

They are squeaky clean from the whole thing. Fucking assholes.
 




 They do 'random' audits to ensure you don't owe them money.
However the biased fuckbags can and will fuck you over first chance they get.

For instance I was told a wee while back I had been audited (I can't recall exact years, but it was something like..) 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005. I didn't owe them anything so was squeaky clean. Oh, they didn't audit 2003 because they owed me about $500 for that year. 




 Yeah, pretty much.
 




 Edit - as /u/TouchMyselfAtNight said! 









 I did, thanks bud!  









 6.7 million dollars directly to the Actor is the surprise!   














 Thanks :) 




 Edited to include sources, where appropriate clarification added. :) 




 Uncalled for. They left a camera alone, respecting ops property. Gotta give them some wicked credit for that!  




 Next time start with this! 
 




 That's putting it quite bluntly, but yeah, I suppose you're right. 




 I understand that - but firing him would imply the company have no need for his role/have replaced him already, thus rendering the 4.7M sheer profit from his death. Which was further more hasten by their firing him to begin with. Very fucked up. 




 I more mean nowadays it requires more disclosure at least.  



















 Thanks bud. 
Edit: did a search for "Coromandel" before I posted, nothing came up. :) 









 Hi /r/Android I know we're not a help centre, but there's a lot of battery misinformation out there, I thought a post which contains some good info might be good to clear the air, and feel free to add your own tips and tricks.

* You don't need to charge your shiny new device straight from the box. In fact every cellphone I've ever come across since 2010 comes precharged to around 60%. 

    [Source: Li-ion does not need to be fully charged, as is the case with lead acid, nor is it desirable to do so. In fact, it is better not to fully charge, because a high voltage stresses the battery](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries)

* Charging every night will not ruin your battery life. The key word here is **ruin**. Unable to find any conclusive proof however. Your battery will charge to 100% and then the charger will switch off, and your phone will discharge over many hours to a preset level before the charger will flick back on and take it back up to 100%. As the source indicates, these 'microcharges' can be performed thousands of times with negligible impact to the battery capacity.  
    [Source: See Table 2 which indicates charging 10% can be done thousands of times](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries)

* Extra reading: However as evidence has [found it is best to have your device off and remove it once charged.](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries)

* Charge your phone in Offline mode (or ultra-battery saving mode if you have it) will significantly speed up charge time. Really handy if you don't have a lot of time and just need a quick boost. 

    [Source](http://www.instructables.com/id/Will-An-iPhone-Charge-Faster-On-Airplane-Mode/)

* If you've forgotten your charger, but have your cable at a hotel chances are the TV will have a USB port you can use in a pinch. (Or if there are limited power outlets and you have multiple devices to charge at once) 
    [Source](http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2012/07/charge-your-usb-gadgets-through-the-tv-in-your-hotel-room-when-travelling/)

* Try to avoid excessive heat unnecessarily. For instance never leave your phone in the sun on your dashboard, or by a window. Batteries really don't like being hot for very long. Once or twice is ok, but don't go making a habit of it. 

    [Source: "Lithium-ion suffers from stress when exposed to heat.." Table3](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries)

* If your phone has a tendency to randomly shut down, there is a chance your battery contacts have become too bad and need to be scratched. I've seen cellphones that wouldn't charge or turn on at all come to life immediately after lightly scratching the contacts with a sharp pin or knife.

    [Source: actually my own experiences working for 3 years in a consumer electronics store.]

* Modern smartphones feed usually as fast as the charger can give it. As a result if you're hunting for a charger look for a higher amperage.

    [Source: "Increasing the charge current does not hasten the full-charge state by much...A high current charge will, however, quickly fill the battery to about 70 percent." ](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries)

That's all I can think of for now, there is a lot of misinformation out there and thought /r/Android could be a trustworthy place for others to be confident about their battery usage. 




 That explains why Ilam road was so damn quiet at lunch! 




 Better camera API.  




 I hope not too.. 









 This was 5 years ago, when they actually had some shred of decency. 




 This was 5 years ago!  














 Between 2 and 3 percent (quick Google) are allergic to milk. You reckon they would alienate their buyers just to satisfy a potential 2 or 3 percent?  



















 I see what you did there. 




 As I'll keep repeating in all these threads - our distances are deceptive. Add a good 1hr to most Google estimates for trips.

It's a stunner of a road to take, prepare with warm clothes should you get stuck, but as pointed out a decent frost in the shadows of those hills can make even a light rain or mist turn to black ice really quickly.

Make sure your spare is pumped up and ready to go should you come off the road/get a flat. Look at hiring some chains, but it is only May so you should be fine.

If you have the time, take the longest route you can, as I said the drive is just beautiful.

Prepare to take breaks, agree before hand to only drive from X to X before the other person takes over. 

If you don't know the road, as it can be windy pull over and let the locals pass, they ~~might~~ will ride your ass if you're too slow.

And finally look for any waterfalls along the route, they can take an extra half hour to get to a random waterfall somewhere but it will stick with you for the rest of your trip!


*edit* FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PREPARE TO PUT YOUR CHAINS ON BEFORE YOU LEAVE! If you have to put chains on and you've never used them - it can take 30 minutes + the first time. That was in the garage at home. Fuck doing it for the first time ever in the snow, and then trusting your life to them..... 




 Red and black - Crusader colours. :) 




 First thing I disable. Plus books, games.. Etc. All that bloatware bullshit. They're clever buggers though, you also need to go into the Samsung App store and untick "automatically update my apps" as that will just reinstall it! 




 For a hit and run though? But probably. 




 Indeed. This just doesn't feel right ay.
(To jog everyones memory: Here's the car)[http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/67616509/auckland-police-fear-for-unidentified-injured-pedestrian] 




 Who the fuck gets hit by a car in a hit and run and *doesn't think to report it*? 

I'm not trying to victim blame here, but I and everyone I know would be utterly outraged at this asshole who tried to run me over I'd ring 111 immediately! 

Not to mention she "fell asleep" which indicates a life threateningly serious concussion. She could have died and didn't think to take herself or demand to be taken to the  hospital!?!?!?!?!? 




 It's still going.. Still not getting texts from my wife on 2 degrees. 









 Gotta love shit timing. 




 http://www.vodafone.co.nz/help/network-status/ 




 The trouble is the similar incident in the states whereby the father actually researched how long his kid would take to die in a hot car, so they charged him. [Source](http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/28/justice/georgia-toddler-death/) 

So while fucking horrible, the police must have found probable cause? Or they are just being cunts and throwing the book at her cause they have nothing better to do.

Dunno. I daresay we'll find out. 


































 The thought process of your average Kiwi driver.

**Green light**

* Ok, send that last text message. It's very important to ensure your friend doesn't think you're ignoring you.
* Put your foot on the brake, take car out of park and into reverse
* Swear a few times as you once again attempt to put into drive.
* Let the car coast forward slightly as you don't like the lurch of the accelerator.
* Gently depress the accelerator pedal.
* Off you go.

**Orange light**

* What orange light? Last I looked it was green.
* Fuck it, I'm already 3 seconds from the intersection, that's not enough to stop!
* Screw it, it's green enough.
* As the light turns red.. I am GOD. Mere mortals stop for me.

**Red Light**

* Let's stop 15 feet from the car in front. Cause I may want to slowly coast forward. Or not. Either way I like the choice.
* Ooh, I have a red, but a green arrow! Let's lurch forward!  YAY!!!
* Ah it's still red. Back to texting. 




 Fuck the world. Spend the next 2 hours looking through [cute kittens playing with wool](http://child-of-artemis.blogspot.com.au/2015/04/cute-baby-kittens-playing-with-yarn.html) 




 How old are they? Can't you argue under the CGA they should last longer than they have? 




 FTFY: Fucking isps are ~~suit counts~~ shit cunts anyway 




 I hate fucking red light runners. I have a green light, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY INTERSECTION. 




 Thanks Op, commenting to look at work tomorrow. (I work at an nz energy provider, but don't dabble too much in this side of things very often and enjoy it when I get to.) 




 They way I see it is they went to the cheapest lower bidder and got burnt after having them hand made in Chch for many years with no problems at all.  




 No, which is ridiculous they 'create' a tenuous link between the two and report them as if they've found then smoking gun when some nutjob goes and kills someone! 




 Indeed.  




 I understand $35 million dollars is a significant investment, so while I can empathetic, I'm struggling to muster sympathy.

They are as you point out following the "rules" but ironicaly I believe it's the current rules set by the media companies in regards to contracts and agreement prices for set television shows (to ensure they get the best price possible) that is actually working heavily against the on-sellers like Lightbox etc. 

I get the uneasy feeling the media companies themselves I'm sure don't want to see a Spotify-like company crop up as that might be seen as devaluing their product (E.g. Television shows) however much they actually make. 

You can't really argue against them (such is the profit driven Hollywood Corporations attitude) which makes acquiring the TV shows and charging a reasonable price almost impossible as I'm sure they place certain strict caveats against how much you can charge/how you can provide the content via DRM etc.

However having been just a mere fly on the wall viewing geographic paywalls slowly disintegrating for a few years now you have to wonder why their research didn't better understand the current market trends, and look at successful content providers such as Spotify or Netflix and working with/against the DRM restrictions to provide a middle ground that meet the demands of the consumers with the requirements of the corporations you're buying the product from.

I will happily admit it's admirable of them to be attempting to penetrate the pirate ridden waters of on-line media, I just feel this article justify their position to be somewhat farcical. 




 What a complete bullshit article.
Your product is only ever as good as someone wants to pay for it. 

You simply cannot come to the party late, holding stale produce and complain when noone buys it.

Where was Lightbox 3 years ago? That was when the market was waking up to the fact we are no longer a captive market, around the same time as Adidas [basically made a sign with a giant middle finger and said FUCK YOU NZ](http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/5410579/Adidas-stands-by-All-Blacks-jersey-price) you will pay what I fucking you tell you to pay by setting their RRP at a substantial rate above anywhere else in the world.

No, enough is enough. The internet has no geographical barriers, you can no longer justify business models that charge more simply because the IP comes from a different country. 

And then when you do compete with the free and open available of content internet in this day you better bring the big guns.

Take for instance Spotify, they very carefully judged their audience and have an advertising supported, and a pay-as-you-go business model. The key reason they have survived and thrived for so long is they are smart about it. They don't limit your listening to certain tracks for Free customers or paid, they limit the functionality instead.

Why lightbox etc are still insisting on the archaic model of limiting content (and relatively speaking very out of date content at that!) to buying customers only is just beyond me. 

You can't justify an aging business model with "Well the current system sucks, so I'm not going to change" cause that's just bullshit.

You can't sell water in a rainforest. We are no longer the captive market they love to price gouge off. 
Companies are attempting to justify an increase in price just because they want someone to pay that much.


 




 Actually [our oceans are fucked.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification)  




 But why do video games cop it so often when in reality there's no scientific evidence an otherwise healthy person who plays videos games has the tendency to go murder someone.. It's bordering on tabloid journalism. 




 Actually they're not this bad usually.
I do love the "bla bla video games .. violent.. obsession.." ^^"Oh, ^^and ^^^he ^^^was ^^^also ^^^a ^^^^neonazi" 









 Respect for 3news! Fair enough you took the effort to post to Reddit, you should be recognised!

This is why I bash Stuff at every available opportunity. That's just bloody rude when the pathetic piss poor excuse for a "journalist" could have easily pm'd you via Reddit.

**If you're reading this, and I bet you are.. Shame on you!** 




 @ /u/philsthrow you should have put a disclaimer on your video man, it's been picked up by [stuff](http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/67718220/Trailer-with-missing-wheel-towed-for-several-kilometres) and co, and instead of linking to Youtube, they're hosting it themselves, which is depriving you of the potential youtube clicks.
fucking rude. I hope they approached you? 




 No, it was the Chinese, which made them for years while they devised a cheaper way in Chch which is just a massive machine which makes them vs previously hand made by special needs and veterans.

The [machine](http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/248267/poppy-contract-returns-to-rsa) failed so they had to buy them from the Australians.

However I can't help but feel if they left the contract in NZ, we wouldn't be in this position. 









 Really, who wins? 

You piss off the staff, you piss off the managers. Who is the real winner with these contracts? 









 No, he just carries around a big "free manure" sign. /s
