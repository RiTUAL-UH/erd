 Django Unchained
Hobbit 2 
Interstellar 
Wolf of Wall Street
Avengers 2
Dark Knight
Dark Knight Rises
Inception 

those are the ones i can think of 




 The least best film of the series. I didn't think it was terribly awful but not particularly good 
They should have ended at Shrek 2  




 Doc Brown and Django in A Million Ways to Die in the West. (wouldn't say they're my favorite but recent good ones) 
 









 E.T, Jaws, Gremlins (?), Lion King, Forrest Gump (sort of)

just never got around to seeing them :/

 




 Hobbit 1 (64%) and Hobbit 3 (61%) - i like them a lot and think they're hated on too much IMO. 

same with Quantum of Solace (65%)  




 Space Jam 




 oh right, thanks a lot!  




 I'm trying to play all heists in order to get the $1mill bonus so i can buy a hydra. i started playing them and then my WIFI was disconnected for 8 weeks and now im finally carrying on with them. Due to the length of time i havent played, will this affect my chances of getting the bonus? Probably an obvious answer but i need to know. 
























 Stand By Me? 




 that Spielberg though 




 WOW - thats awful 




 i gotta say "Hit by Lightning" 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2402619/   - heres the poster  




 Ratatouille  




 Ferris Bueller's Day Off ("Pardon my French, but your an asshole") 




 this poster isn't new, this debuted with the super bowl spot 




 Harry Potter improved over time (not that it was ever bad)

Shrek decreased (1+2 awesome, 3 poor, 4 bad)   IMO 




 Four guys from the suburbs hit the road, and the road hit back 




 Star Wars: The Force Awakens - Teaser 2 

is one of them 




 Chappie 





























 I bought a Savage and although I love the guns and firepower, it's very defenseless and it leaves me vulnerable flying around in free mode. This got me thinking that R* need to put on the ability to sell Pegasus vehicles, so if you buy the Savage and are dissatisfied you can just sell it. 

not sure what question i wanna ask but comment your thoughts/ideas/suggestions on this topic.   




 church in pacific bluffs 




 the explosion is shit, but the spear is hilarious!  




 i just bought one and i think..

extremely OP, but awesome at the same time
it looks cool (as in the design and colors)

weak amour and defense (1 rocket and it's done)

what are your thoughts? 




 Edge of Tomorrow
 














 Mine..

1. Kingsman: The Secret Service 
2. Mad Max: Fury Road
3. Avengers: Age of Ultron
4. Furious 7
5. Run All Night

fire away! 




 my favorite movie of 2015 so far 




 Godzilla and Pacific Rim 




 either Thor: The Dark World or First Avenger

so many people hate on these 2 and I really enjoyed them. (even though Malekith was a pretty weak villain) 




 The Inbetweeners movies  


































 Captain America Winter Soldier made me appreciate First Avenger more the 2nd time watching it 




 I was looking at the current list and both "Furious 7" and "Avengers: Age of Ultron" are both in it (and still climbing). 
I'm seriously rooting for The Force Awakens to get into the top 10. 
Do you reckon it will? + i'd love Spectre to get there too but im not sure that it will.  




 Skyfall is the best Bond film ever, Casino Royale is awesome but Skyfall is just plainly better IMO 




 I thought she was good in Tomorrowland and just thought she's make a good Oracle. I can imagine her in the glasses and wheelchair, but i know that comic readers will have a different opinion to me. 
what do you guys think of the idea? 




 that was fucking awful 




 for me 

Paul Blart 2
Big Game
Wild Card 
Taken 3
 etc. 
 




 between 60-80%  




 Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and The World's End

there is no best IMO  




 Chronicle  




 Home Alone 4 
























 Jason Statham made this movie 




 My thoughts

Jurassic Park - amazing 
The Lost World - average
Jurassic Park 3 - bad

what are your thoughts on the trilogy?? Are you excited for Jurassic World? 














 awesome 




 Toy Story trilogy, Monsters Inc and Finding Nemo

p.s. i've never seen the Incredibles (yep.) 




 im actually really looking forward to it!  




 the 1 movie i always forget is coming out this year.  




 so many haters. i like the look of this!  




 I just randomly wondered who Clarke could play in the DCCU and i think he would be awesome as Dent/Two-Face (if he ever became Two face) what do you guys think?
who should Clarke play if he came to the DCCU? 












































 lucius fox is in the game 














 seriously what's the point in adding the solid gold jet? Why pay $10,000,000 for a jet when you can go and steal one from the airport and fly it around for FREE? 
Rockstar should only add NEW things and not rehashed exsisting stuff. 

That being said what stuff should be added in your opinion?  




 looks awesome! 



















 Everyone always asks who should play Bond next (I think Henry Cavill) but not too many people ask who the next villain should be. So that's what I'm asking.

I'm thinking Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor (he was rumored for Bond 24) and Idris Elba would be good ones. (Yes i would prefer Elba as a villain rather than Bond himself). 

Who are you guys thinking of?
