Example:

Boy: I'm off to school Mom.
Mom: Ok, don't forget to bring a packed lunch.

When it should be like this:

Boy: I'm off to school Mom.
Mom: Don't forget to take a packed lucnh.

If you're talking to someone and you're asking them to take something from where you are to somewhere else the word take should be used. If you're talking to someone and you want them to bring something to your current location the word bring should be used. I don't understand the misuse. 










































































 It just seems logical. So much quicker, plus you don't have to remember/write down your passwords and such. 













































































































































































































































































































































































































































 I'm literally angry with rage right now.

I love Gears of War. Easily the best part about it in my opinion is Horde mode. It's the mode me and my mate spent the most time playing in Gears 2 and Gears 3. Now all of a sudden they've removed for some unknown reason.

And to add insult to injury the game is shipping with only 4 COMPETITIVE MULTIPLAYER MAPS!!!!!! Gears 3 shipped with 10 for fuck's sake. I have been lookin gfor ward to this game for so damn long and now my dreams have been dashed against the rocks of bitterness. Sure I'll still play the campaign and a bit of overrun mode and miltuplayer but the main draw is gone.

I know for a fact that if I hadn't pre-ordered this game weeks ago I sure as heel wouldn't be buying it now.

Way to royally fuck things up People Can Fly.

Anyone else disappointed by this news? 
























































































































































































 I personally don't really mind. Most of my games are on disc but I have a couple of dozen games downloaded from Xbox LIVE and PSN. I would probably be sad when the time comes that games no longer come on a physical medium but I will understand that it's been made redundant. 
































































 Please don't downvote people for their opinions, unless they word them in a scumbag kind if way. 

Personally I hate Gangnam Style and Harlem Shake videos. I just genuinely don't see the appeal of either and am befuddled as to why they are so popular. 

Your turn...

 I've been in a crew of 3 with a couple of mates since launch. They're not buying the PS4 version and so I think I'll want to join a crew that does stuff. No roleplaying or anything but definitely fun stuff. I'm an average gunman but an above average vehicle handler.

What does your crew offer in the way of fun/things to do? 










































































 RULES FOR CONSIDERATION:

-They must be somewhat realistic. For example Sonic and Mario are not allowed, but Master Chief and Marcus Fenix are allowed.
- They must be proficient with guns. Swords and fireballs etc don't count.
- They may be male or female.


HAVE AT IT! 






























































































 One of the most strangely fascinating films I ever saw was Waking Life.

Blurb:
A boy has a dream that he can float, but unless he holds on, he will drift away into the sky. Even when he is grown up, this idea recurs. After a strange accident, he walks through what may be a dream, flowing in and out of scenarios and encountering various characters. People he meets discuss science, philosophy and the life of dreaming and waking, and the protagonist gradually becomes alarmed that he cannot awake from this confusing dream.  


































 Think about it. When your wife asks where you're going you can truthfully tell her "I'm going to the future." Say you had to come back home because you forgot your wallet, when leaving for the second time you could say "I'm going back to the future!"

 Hey guys. My oldest and most popular series is Skyrim Roleplay Adventure where I never break the 4th wall.

Here's the first episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_K8F-MGvw

And here's the latest episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qOufdKDD88

Please let me know what you think. 




 Hey guys. I've been making Let's Play videos for a year now and would like to share some of my thoughts of my experience.

My channel focuses mainly on story driven let's plays, my oldest and most popular series is Skyrim Roleplay Advneutre where I never break the 4th wall. In addition to this I have done let's plays of The Last Of Us (no commentary), Gears of War Judgment, Max Payne 3, GTAV, Metal Gear Solid 2 HD (no kills, no commentary) and Heavy Rain Move Edition (no commentary). I also make and upload random videos like GTA montages and I used to make the occasional Black Ops 2 video.

As anyone who does let's plays can tell you there's much more to it than simply playing the game with a mic in front of you, which I wasn't expecting when I started. I think I've streamlined my process a lot since I began doing this last year and the general quality of my videos has improved as the months have passed.

I seem to be plagued by inactive subscribers, although this may be due to my upload schedule. I always stayed away from a schedule because I didn't want this hobby to start feeling like work, but realised my subs deserve content at regular intervals. So I started uploading my two current let's plays of Skyrim and Beyond Two Souls at 8pm GMT on Fridays and Wednesdays respectively. This doesn't seem to have helped my view count at all. I suspect that because the majority of my  views come from America I should start uploading videos at USA friendly times, do you think this is a good idea?

I'm disappointed that I have nearly 300 subscribers but struggle to get more than 15 views per video, after a year of doing this I've only made $25. I've considered giving up a couple of times but then I regain the passion for making the videos and carry on. Another thing that bothers me is that people almost never leave comments on my videos. I welcome feedback and always respond to the few comments that do get posted. Oh well, if they don't want to leave a comment they shouldn't feel obliged to I suppose, but it would be nice to have some interaction with my fans so I can humanise them. For the last year they've just been some intangible force.

Anyway that's my experience after one year of making let's plays. Let's hope the second year is more rewarding.

 Does it stack?

Example: If I use Aquaman's S1 to cause bleeding them immediately use it again do I get double bleeding damage or should I wait until the first bleed is finished before tridenting the enemy again?

 Can the name of a sub be changed once it's started? 
































































 I put the work in to get into the top 4% and then like many others my time and effort was turned into a complete and utter waste of time literally overnight. I was down to some shitty bronze level. Did anyone get compensdated for the work they put in? Like at least be given the reward for the rank they were at before the game fucked them over? I think that would only be fair. Or if that's too much work for the guys who make the game how about a good faith prize of 100,000 credits or something? It would really suck if they fucked us over and offered nothing to make up for it. The risk of it happening again haunts me. 



















 I couldn't play saturday but have been sessioning the game for the last two days but I don't have time to get to the top 4%. It seems everyone is playing this season much more than the last couple.

*Ares' 














 I was in the top 5%, then I checked again hours later (without playing) and I was in the top 3%. I look this morning and just assume a new season had started. Nope. There's 15 or so hours left and I'm bronze because of the battle points issue. I'm not playing today, what's the point in giving us an extra 24 hours? WTF can we achieve in that time? Silver? I wish they'd just accepted this season as a complete fail and moved onto a season with a decent reward instead of trying to resurrect this season's corpse for 24 hours. Now I have no reason to play the game for the next 15 hours. 















































































 It seems to me that every time he opens his mouth he says something you'd expect to hear from someone living in the 1700's. 





























 Why do they allow us to pay for promotion on most cards, but then there's some that can only be promoted if you're lucky enough to get that card again from a certain pack (looking at you killer frost) while others can only be promoted through online challenges? It's infuriating! I have GF Supes, Ares, and KJJ on a team. I have a promotion waiting for Supes as I completed the single player challenge twice. I have to wait for Ares to show up in the MP season again to get a promotion for him so who knows when that'll happen, and KJJ won't be promoted until I manage to get another 60 alliance credits together.

On another team I have Raven, Aquaman, and Killer Frost regime. Raven and Aquaman can be promoted at any time with credits, I like this. But Killer Frost can only be promoted by being lucky enough to find her again in a challenge booster pack, which I have no intention of doing because there's too many cards in there that I don't want to warrant trying to get one specific card from it. This seems like lunacy to me. Does anyone know why they've made it so infuriating to keep teammates promoting in sync? 












































 Who are they and do you rotate characters from team to team?

I've always teamed 3 characters together and stuck with that. I only ever mess up the teams when doing challenges that require certain characters.

I currently have 7 teams in my rotation, they are:

Bronze Team:

Nightwing E7 Lv 47
Green Lantern E7 Lv 47
The Flash E7 Lv 47

Silver Team:

Deathstroke E7 Lv 50
Regime Doomsday E7 Lv 50
Wonder Woman E7 Lv 50

The following teams are all gold:

Regime Superman E1 Lv 50
Batman E1 Lv 49
Regime Wonder Woman E1 Lv 50

Man of Steel General Zod Lv 50
Lobo Lv 50
Red Son Green Lantern Lv 50

Raven Lv 38
Aquaman Lv 38
Killer Frost Lv 38

Blackest Night Batman Lv 32
Luchador Bane Lv 31
Regime Raven Lv 31

Godfall Superman Lv 24
Ares Lv 24
Killing Joke The Joker Lv 24

I don't buy power credits that's why I have so few promoted gold cards.

My next team will be Cassandra Cain Batgirl, who I've already got, and I'm going to team her up with Animated Batman Beyond and MKX Scorpion when they turn up. 














 Hey guys. I just tried to buy 600,000 power credits using some itunes credit I have lying around but it seems to have not spent the credit. I can live with this, but the game crapped out on me after it said "purchase complete". I reloaded the game to find I have 1,200,000 power credits. I only wanted one money pack but I seem to have been given two. I did not intend on buying two packs. I want to see if I've been shafted and charged for an extra pack I didn't want. These things are 35 a piece! Is there any way I can see my purchase history? This is an issue. 











































































































































































































































































































 Pretty sure I'm asking for trouble here. Let's see if we can engage in civil discourse.

 I love 3D in films and games.

I love VR.

I have a PS4.

Guess what I'm looking forward to. 




 I've literally never hear anyone say meninism before. This is new to me.
 




 As seen on the front page yesterday. 




 The PS4's controller last for 4hrs on one charge.

Sounds like your controller was broken mate. I can usually get pretty much a full day of gaming done on one charge, and I don't dim the light bar at all. I guess the amount of vibrating the controller does plays a big part, but since I play GTA Online and Mortal Kombat X the most these days I'd say my controller vibrates a lot.

Edit: Downvoted for...... I got nothing. 




 The trouble with Jason Statham is this. He plays the exact same character in every film he's in. "The guy that beats up everyone." Don't get me wrong, he's very good at it, but every new film I see him in I just think "Oh, he's doing what he does in every film, nothing new."

But that's just me. 




 I've always preferred racing cleanly. But when I know I'm up against a dirty driver I'll go ham on their ass. I'm pretty good at racing in GTA and I have this mantra:

There's a difference between a dirty driver, and a good driver who's driving dirty. Got any racing crews I should look up? I've been away from GTA for a while because 18 months of playing it daily burned me out, plus my old crew members all stopped playing, this seems like a good reason to get back into the game I love.  




 Also If you accidently hit someone off, you have to wait and let them pass you

If I find myself racing someone that seems to be a clean driver I'll try to avoid hitting them. If I do hit them I always slow down for them as a sign that I didn't do it on purpose. Maybe I should look into joining a race crew, never considered that being a thing. I much prefer the racing to things like TDM Capture anyway. 




 I'm sure you can. But it's hard to kill someone when they've got their sight aimed at the only entrance/exit to the place. 




 Yeah true, I could have worded it better. But I was fresh out of a conversation with one of those pricks and my anger carried over. I think the name is applicable though. Anyone who considers themselves to be a better human being than someone else simply because of the piece of metal and plastic they use to play video games on, is a retard. They claim "It's satire" and "It's a joke!". Well, it's not a joke to the people they insult and try to make feel like shit. 




 Exactly. I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I'm just saying that without us "useless peasants" a lot of the games PC gamers love wouldn't even exist, or at least would exist in a worse capacity due to budgetary constraints. 




  And its not steams choice to put the game on sale its the developers themeselves

Yeah, because it's the best way they can get people to buy their games on steam since games on steam are so cheap they can't possibly charge full price for it. The market is willing to part with less cash per game than the console market. I guess that's the crux of my argument. 




 Having a game slightly held back graphically is better than having a game majorly held back by a lack of budget, or even having no game at all. 




  AC Unity (a flop in many ways) and Far Cry 4 haven't been more than 40% off (35.99) on Steam, for example.

Maybe I was exaggerating a bit, but I'm willing to bet that's still cheaper than they've ever been on consoles when bought brand new.

I once saw a collection of 5 GTA games for something like 30. That blew my mind. I've been told many times that PC games are so cheap on steam they actually offset the massive cost of the hardware, the the point of PC gaming actually being the cheaper option in the long run. That's some cheap games right there. 




 If you don't mind paying 45 quid for console versions, you shouldn't mind paying the same or more for better PC versions.

I disagree. I'm ok with paying 55 (current average price of a new game) on console because I don't have an alternative. If I switched to PC gaming I'd definitely take advantage of the low low prices PC gamers enjoy.

The sales on PSN and XBOX Live pale in comparison to the sales on steam. I don't recall ever hearing a console gamer saying "I have 200 games in my backlog", but it's a relatively common PC gamer quote.

I'm not saying that consoles don't do anything that could potentially harm profit of games such as sales, but that we're constantly being told how much cheaper games are on PC. I'm routinely told that games are so cheap on PC that it offsets the massive cost of the hardware and actually turns out to be the cheaper gaming option in the long run, the game are that much cheaper.

As for used games, I feel this argument is negated by the PC pirating argument. They cancel each other out.  




 Not really. It's more a case of "We need more money to make better games. And consoles give us the most money. So if we didn't develop for consoles The Witcher 3 would be a shell of what it currently is because the budget would have been much smaller." 




 Available to the common man in 2030. 




 Fine... I'll say it if no-one else will.

Ahem.

Dat ass tho. 




 "This way, if one of us falls, we all fall! Yay!" 




  If you buy games at release, you would continue to buy games at release

I bet some people would change their buying habits, it's impossible to say. On console we don't have ability to wait 4 months for the price to drop 85% like PC gamers do. 




  like Starcraft II, with 6 million units sold, which compares well against Gears of War 3's 6.3 million).

I'm willing to bet that Starcraft II had the benefit of being in steam sales, which are known to knock up to 95% of a game's price off. Compare that to Gears of War 3 where the vast majority of copies sold likely went for full retail price or close to it. While the number of units sold is comparable, the price of each unit sold could possibly vary wildly between the two games.

I'm just speculating here but I bet the 6 million copies of GoW3 made way more money (not including dlc or microtransactions) than starcraft II did. Of course I could be totally wrong. There's a lot of assumptions being made here. I guess the point is, games are way cheaper on PC, and therefore don't make as much money, and therefore don't allow devs to get a bigger budget for the next game as much as console sales do. 




 lack of fees to physical copies

I'm not sure what you mean by this. Are you saying they save money because they don't have to put the game on a disc?

More sells in general

There may be more sales on PC but the games are selling for way less than people pay on consoles with all the constant steam sales going on.

Five GTA games for 20? Yeah, console gamers have to pay a little bit more than that. 




  Ezio or another assassin would work too, I suppose

Just like Spawn, it's been done before. We don't need another fighting game with him in. 




   Rain is probably not coming due to him being DLC last time (and them saying previously they don't want to charge for the same character twice in a row)

Boon says a lot of stuff that turns out to be just lies though. I take what he says with a pinch of salt these days.

That said, he's tweeted multiple times "The Rain falls when he may". So, guessin gis all we can do I guess. 




  I'd love seeing the most hated return if not just to annoy a lot of the fans.

You just admitted you'd be perfectly fine with the only reason to include those characters is to piss off other people who love the game you love.

So you're an asshole? 




 Can anyone name any guest characters in fighting games that have been in more than one franchise? Obviouslly not including Smash Bros.

Spawn was in the Xbox version of Soul Calibur 2, not sure if he'd make an appearance in MKX. 




 All I want is Noob. But isn't it too obvious it's going to be Rain, Sindel, Smoke, and Baraka? 




  They recode/port games to consoles

What about all the games that are ported to PC? It's it 50/50? aren't there just as many ports either way? Also PC games are usually only 5 or 10 cheaper than the console version. Steam sales make games as little 10% of the price of an average console version. PC gamers give developers less money than console gamers, I mean a lot less. 




 Let's say 100 million console gamers just made the switch to PC gaming overnight. The sales numbers wouldn't be comparable because of the aforementioned cheapness of games in general on PC. Profits would go down and therefore budgets would go down, and games would likely get worse. 




 The PC sales would rise but the prices of games on steam are so low that even with the increased PC player base the profit margins wouldn't be anywhere near where they are now with console gamers paying on average something like 45 for a game, and PC gamers pay what, an average of 15 per game? Also humble bundles, all those free games have to be paid for on console. 




 You're right, it doesn't mean I should. but it also doesn't mean it shouldn't. I'm sorry if I offended you. 




 This is an excerpt from an interview with Marcin Iwinski from CD Projekt Red.

"If the consoles are not involved there is no Witcher 3 as it is," answers Marcin Iwinski, definitively. "We can lay it out that simply. We just cannot afford it, because consoles allow us to go higher in terms of the possible or achievable sales; have a higher budget for the game, and invest it all into developing this huge, gigantic world.

Finally. Listen up PC Master Retards. I know PC gaming is king, anyone who disagrees is an idiot. But the next time you give us console gamers shit because our systems are "Holding back gaming" and "Necessitating the dumbing down of our precious games" Just remember that a fucking huge chunk of the money given to developers from the sale of their games comes from us console gamers. Those precious steam sales you always brag about, the cheapness of the games you're always boasting about, they're not doing the devs any favours.

So the next time you bitch about console gamers ruining your games, just know that without us you wouldn't have half of them at all.

Now let's all get along for fuck's sake.

 I found them yesterday when someone posted this and called it "Find Link!" 




 The multiplayer in RDR had some great ideas, but god damn was it one of the most broken online experiences I've ever had. Sometimes it would be cool, you'd posse up and do gang hideouts. Never really got into the competitive stuff because of the aforementioned brokenness.

And by brokenness, I mean invisible people on bulls that slide along the ground, missing any kind of animation, and being killed by mystery people constantly.

I would rate the single player of RDR a perfect 10/10, and I don't bandy 10/10 very much. But I would give the multiplayer a 3/10 because of how broken it was for me. It would be 1/10 but they had some really cool ideas hidden in there. 




 So you'd gang up on people who caused carnage but when people come after you for the same reason you run away and hide in a spot that makes you impossible to kill?

So brave, lol. 




 I can't agree more. I used to always honk my horn as a sign of friendliness, trying to meet people, do missions with them.

But after a while of having people kill you for no reason you really start to lose the will to be friendly. These days I will immediately murder anyone who gets what I deem to be too close. I won't think twice about blowing their car up. I use to worry about paying for their car, now I see it as a minor inconvenience.

About a year ago I became the thing I hated most when playing GTA Online, and I make no apologies. The small amount of bastards in the game have slowly turned everyone else into a bastard. 




 Yeah, I know what swatting is lol. I was being an arsehole. 




  I'm one of these people who doesn't read every article on the Internet

I'm also one of those people. But news is everywhere these days. I'm surprised you didn't hear of it. 




 Thanks for the heads up but... what can we do with this information? I mean, that situation isn't all that common. I guess we just keep playing. 




 This is old news. I don't see how anyone living in the UK didn't know this last week when it was all over the news.

What pissed me off the most was that people were complaining that it's sexist. Saying it portrays women in a negative light. While it does portray women in a negative light no-one was talking about the fact that they has almost identical ads with men on them. But because they were portraying men in a negative light it's not seen as sexist.

Fucking double standards. 




 swated? 




 And then she said , "That is NOT two children wearing a trenchcoat!" 




 I found Sub-Zero and Marge Simpson.

That'll do. 




 I would only ever use it if I has permission first, which is fucked up when you think about it.

It's considered racist for a non-black  person to say a word, which is itself pretty racist.

Anyway, yeah, I'd never use it as an insult in any way. I once knew a pair of black twins and we became good friends (this was a few years back). They used to say nigga a lot, so I asked them if it were cool if used it when talking to them. I made it clear that it would only ever be used as a sign of friendship and not as a derogatory term.

They were totally fine with it. They were a couple of cool dudes. I wonder where they are now. 




 If the Raiden challenge doesn't get released with the new update I'm giving up all hope of it ever coming out.

"Coming Soon" my fucking arse. 




 It's the premiere of the film Michael produced, or co-produced, I forget. 




 That's brilliant. At first I thought, ok, I see where this is headed. But the various cut scenes they put him in were great choices. I just want to see Lester dancing like this in the background of every shot the next time I play through the story.

How Nightmares Are Born

or

The Arrival of Nope 




 No faction wars for 2 days now and STILL NO RAIDEN CHALLENGE. I'm running out of reasons to keep playing this instead of going back to Injustice. It's like they want people to stop playing. 




 This is what I do on both Pokemon and Injustice. People say X is the best character in terms of dps and health, Y is the best character to team with X because reasons.

I literally only use characters I simply feel like using. All my teams are personal to me as a result. 




 Yes, exactly. And when we don't know if something is true the default position of a rational mind is to not believe it's true until we DO know.

I'm not saying ghosts don't exist. I'm saying that there is no good reason right now to believe the claim that they exist, and so I don't believe it. I could be wrong, but I think it's foolish to believe a claim without a good reason.  




 It's like Netherrealm went out of their way to make a lot of the costumes in this game fucking hideous.  




 Fair enough I suppose. It just seems like all the combo videos I see online do the same thing. They show a character doing a combo but done even attempt to try to teach you anything. I guess some of that hostility carried over to this video to. I apologise, you didn't deserve my shitty comment.  




 My favourite part was when the video explained ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  




 You can duck it. But then they do it again and again without giving you time to stand up, walk, and duck again. Yeah you can slide under it but you need literally perfect timing to avoid every bullet.  




 As a Sub Zero mainer I can confirm that his slide is very punishable.

Anyone know how to counter full auto jacqui's machine gun as sub zero? Tired of being beaten by people spamming that OP move.  




 This. You can't buy something not knowing what it included (even though it's been publicly available for months) then complain it didn't include something they didn't list.  




 Good job I think the Russian costumes are hideous.

 Hahahahhaha! It's funny because he's dumb! HAHHAA! 




 I'm already bored of the single player. I played the story. Dabbled with the towers. But ever since I started gaming online I've found fighting the CPU in fighting games to be really boring and unsaisfying, which is a shame given the amount of single player content on offer here.

If only they gave us a good reward for beating the towers, I might bother with them more often. The complete 50 living towers trophy is gonna kill me. 




 It's been down for me since last night. I noticed it was down 16 hours ago, and it's still down. 




 Further proof that troll no longer means "monster that dwell sunder bridges trying to eat children" but now means "Cunt who finds pleasure in pissing people off." 




 The comment may have not seemed dumb to me at the time. But upon reflection I can see I was making several assumptions to lead me to the point I felt warranted posting. I was dumb to make a comment based on said  assumptions and therefore I consider the comment to be dumb, or at the very least not very well thought out.

I don't mind being proven wrong though, it means I've learned something new. I now know more truths than I did when I posted that comment, and that's a good thing in my book.  




 Then please disregard my previous comments. They were dumb and unnecessary.  




 Copied from just a couple of days ago. Impressive. 




 I feel bad that I eat meat. I mean, I can't justify it. It's immoral.

But fuck 'em, because bacon and steak. 




 I'd 100% the story, then spend all my time doing missions in GTA Online. 




 As much as I'd like some story DLC I'm glad to see they're not done with GTA Online. I need a reason to go back there since everyone I played with has left and there's not really much else left that I want to buy. I've got 2 mil sat in the bank, just waiting for something spend it on. Over 42 days spent in GTA Online, I've done pretty much everything there is to do in Los Santos many times each, it'll be nice to have a reason to go back there.

Unless the content they're talking about is just more jobs, most of which I'll never play (capture etc etc). Fewer jobs and more missions would be nice. And I mean missions, not just:

1. Go here.
2. Grab this.
3. Take is here.

That's 99% of the missions in GTA Online unfortunately. 




 Or, y'know. Yawning. 




  But hundreds of thousands of experiences, if not more, can't ALL be attributed to mental illness or mistake

Yes they can. Of course they can. Why do you think they can't all be explained by natural means? That's like saying 2 billion people can't be wrong. Yes they can! you just made the appeal to popularity logical fallacy.

The number of people believing something has absolutely no bearing on whether or not it's true.



some of those somethings have been captured on photographs and video

And yet not a single one has been confirmed. Not a single account of anything supernatural in the history of mankind has ever been confirmed as being true. That's why the default position on supernatural occurrences is to not believe it until it's been demonstrated to be true, which is why I don't believe, because every single claim of the supernatural has failed to meet it's burden of proof. 

 It would be better to assume it exists and try to quantify it, than to assume it doesn't and ignore it

But people aren't ignoring it. People are doing real scientific tests (and have been forever) to see if such things exist. People will always test for those things. BUT UNTIL THERE'S A GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THEY EXIST THE DEFAULT POSITION IS TO NOT BELIEVE A CLAIM. Sorry for shouting but that's the most important part. There is no good reason (word of mouth is not a good reason) to believe ghosts exist. People are looking for them, they will continue to look, but they've found nothing.

If ghosts were even half confirmed it would be the biggest news in the history of mankind. Make no mistake, people are looking, but they've found nothing so far. 




 You are 100%. There is always the possibility of a method being developed, but until such a thing exists there's no way to verify paranormal claims and therefore no good reason the believe any of them are real things i.e. ghosts. 




 It's all good then. 




 Lol. I had no friends with the game, but I met some people online in Paradise City and had a blast trying to complete as many of the 500+ online challenges together and against each other. Fuck. I need to play that game again.  

















































 Seriously. the game has been out for what, two months at this point? And pretty much since launch they've told us the challenge is "coming soon". Stretching the definition of the word soon IMO.

They also lose points for spelling koming with a c. 














 I want to know if I'm in the top 2000 players (ranked 1v1) in the world, or just on the PS4 k thx bye. 














 How are your wins/losses presented to other players? If I'm playing ranked 1v1 and I see my opponent's wins/losses, is that their total online wins/losses or just their wins/losses for ranked 1v1? Same goes for other game modes like KOTH. 












































 I've been doing the souls exploit to be able to have multiple attempts at the test your luck and daily objectives. I notice there's a reward rank for the test your luck and it goes up each day, unless I do the souls exploit, then it resets. My question is this. Is it worth letting the reward rank rack up? I remember a similar thing on Injustice Mobile but the rewards were a joke, even after hundreds of consecutive days. Should I hold out for great rewards or just say fuck it and keep cheating? 





























 The red spear symbol under the koins earned in the post fight menu, does that represent ranking XP? 




 Who are you using?

**Bronze:**

Lin Quei, Shirai Ryu, Monk



**Silver:**

Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Farmer Jax

Kano, D'Vorah, Reptile

Jax Briggs, Sonya Blade, Kenshi


**Gold:**

Ninjutsu Scorpion, Shaolin Kung Jin, Inferno Scorpion

Stunt Double Johnny Cage, Sun God Kotal Kahn, Possessed Kenshi

Assassin Kitana (lucky pull!), Bojutsu Kung Jin, [waiting for Raiden]

All the gold cards were attained from gold kombat packs. 




 It seems Netherrealm are trying to stretch the definition of the terms "temporarily down" and "coming soon".

I know some people are able to play the Faction Wars. Congrats Netherrealm, you almost managed to get an online portion of a game working. Does anyone know how "soon" the Raiden challenge coming? I plan on adding him to Assassin Kitana and Bojustsu Kung Jin but if it's going to be months before the challenge arrives I might as well buy more gold packs. 




 I had the hatch I app on my phone a while back but got bored and deleted it. Now I see it's got Apple watch support I got it again. But it seems all you can with the watch is look at you hatchi. I can't seem to interact at all. Does anyone know if you actually can interact with it? If you can't in deleting it again.  




 How do you get them? Seems like I haven't gotten any new ones in ages and I've forgotten how you get them. 




 So I'm fighting... some tower. the last one in the Kove looking portion of the map. Was it really too much to ask for them to label these things? Regardless.

I'm on fight 4/6, and it's cheap IMO. Firstly I'm forced to use a card I don't own. This annoys me because it messes up the equal levelling I used to go for in Injustice, but I can live with that. The trouble is Cassie's passive. It claims "All Spec Ops teammates have a 25% chance of unblockable attacks." And she's teamed with 2 Spec Ops cards. I don't believe the 25% part at all. In my experience 3 out of 5 attacks they do is unblockable, and this is all 3 characters remember. So I've breezed up to this point, but now because I can't use my own team (and the passive benefits that provides) I need to bring two cards that are wildly OP in order to finish this battle. When you're stripped of your team passives and the ability to block while the computer has both of those advantages the fight is insanely cheap.

The rampant and unpredictable difficulty in the fights in this game need to be addressed. You can be going along just fine then BAM! They give you a fight that's in a different league from the ones that preseded it in the same damn tower. If this was a boss battle I could almost be ok with the cheapness, but it's just fight 4/6.

Cheap. 









 If his match win animation doesn't include him whipsering ["Anytime..."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHhCYpnnGoo) to his fallen opponent I'm gonna sow cress seeds into Netherealm's carpets as a sign of protest. 




 I must say this game doesn't disappoint on the whole. Sure the multiplayer suffers from lag, but the lag seems largely consistent so I can usually work around it. Certainly no worse than MK9 and Injustice as far as I can tell.

The graphics are awesome, not the best I've seen, but definitely "next gen", which is something we've seen too little of since the consoles launched IMO.

Sound design. Top notch! I know they put a lot of work into the sound for the game and it shows. All the right crunches and whooshes are there.

Story mode. The best story mode in any fighting game I've played. Worth playing just for the cut scenes. I'm glad Netherealm put so much time into what is now a largely ignored fighting game mode. I love the fact that as well as each character having their own unique arcade mode ending there's a singular canon narrative to play through that solidifies everything story wise.

Music. Can't complain. It does the job, reminds me of MK9.

Krypt. I think this is a fun way to unlock stuff in a game, best krypt so far IMO.

Basically I'm loving this game more than I was hoping I would. I only have a couple of gripes, but they're small and easily ignored when looking at the game as a whole.

1. No Noob Saibot. My mains are always Sub-Zero and Noob. At least Sub-Zero's good in this game.2
2. Sub-Zero's defaiult costume is ugly as hell! But there's plenty of good ones and the inclusion of the Klassic skin made up for the poor Kurrent one.
3. I miss the avatrs from the old KoTH mode. But oh well.

What do you guys think of the game? 









 This started today for me. After every fight I just get the MK logo loading symbol, the one that usually precedes the post battle info like koins earned etc. I have to close the app and reopen it.

Anyone else having this issue? iOS 




 I want to know when to come back and laugh at all the people who waited until it wasn't relevant anymore to get red. 












































 Title. 












































 Anyone else really happy that this exists? I've always hated the new Sub Zero design. I don't mind the Kuai Liang and Revenant kostumes but god DAMN the klassic skin is too sexy. Feels great to represent my boy Sun Zero with him looking the way I remember. After giving him the MKII klassic skin in MK9 I love the fact they went for the UMK3 klassic skin this time.

Any other costumes you guys are super happy with?

[For those who haven't seen it](http://insidemk.altervista.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Mortal-Kombat-X_Sub-Zero_Klassic_Bio.jpg) 

















































 Probably not. But seriously, when will we get the other half of the game? 









 I'd love to Netherealm, but you won't fucking let me. Can't they just remove this uncompletable objective until they finally have a product that's ready for launch? 



















 I have a bonus mission "Win 3 fights using a Spec Ops card that you own."

I'm doing the tower where Kitana is on your team and I put Trooper on my team and won 3 fights. The bonus mission shows no progress.

Is this a known bug? 




 I'm currently up to the Reptile boss. Is there going to be a faster way to earn souls, or at the very least more ways? I know it's the premium currency and they want to make you buy them but god damn they're slow to earn. At this stage I think I actually prefer the "buy characters for a ridiculous amount of gold" system they used in Injustice. At least with that system I always felt like I was earning currency to go towards characters.

I suppose factions will include some way of earning souls. Whenever they actually manage to make it work that is. 














 I've only encountered two bosses thus far, Kotal Khan and Reptile, and is it just me or are they wildly overpowered?

I mean, I know bosses are meant to be tougher than their henchmen but when you can simply breeze through 6 or 7 fights then all of a sudden hit a wall you can't get past until you seriously upgrade your cards, that's surely an issue? Is there any particular reason (other than to try to hassle you into buying microtransactions) why they would do this? 









 I was expecting this game to be at least as fun as Injustice but from what I can tell so far it's. It's not even close.

The animations look sloppy in the MK game. They look like they were animated by amateurs. The animations on injustice were crisp, clear, and just better looking, they flowed more realistically. 

I call bull on the control scheme. I was told that like Injustice if you tap you get a weak combo and if you swipe you get a heavy combo. Well, so far tapping and swiping have done nothing but activate the same two combos. There's literally no difference between tapping and swiping, meaning that when I tell my character to attack I have no idea what he's going to do. Is this a problem with the game or jut my version? I'd be interested in hearing.

There's so many other little things that injustice did right that MK mobile just does wrong. It's like this game was made before injustice.

How do you evade specials that involve throws? Seems awfully cheap of you can't do the equivalent of blocking them like other specials.

I was expecting something so much better. I was expecting injustice with MK characters. What I got was what genuinely feels like a cheap injustice knock-off. And I don't know how they managed to do that.

I'm still playing the game obviously, I'm having to rely on blind hope that the game actually improves and begins to feel good to play, but if what I've played so far is any indicator of how bad this game is to play, then I'll have to be out, and I don't want to be out. 

What are your thoughts on the game so far? 




 It's happening a lot, but it's sporadic. Seemingly completely random. I've restarted my computer. Looked at the task manager. Looked at devices in the control panel, but saw no solution or even cause. Any help would be appreciated. 


































 Redundant text right here. 




















































































 I think I recall reading a long time ago that shattering gear in quick succession reaps bonus shards, or something.

Any kind souls willing to lay out the rules for shattering to maximise rewards? Or point me in the direction of a guide for such activities? 



















 My current favourite team is MKX Scorpion, CCBG, and ABB. The gear I use with this team is as follows.

MKX = Bone Spikes, Mark of the Tiger, and Ra's Al Ghul's Scimitar

CCBG = Carbonfiber Mask, Dark Sword, and Nullification Rifle.

ABB = Azarthian Cloak, Icebound Necklace, The Batmobile.

I know I'd be better off using the scimitar on Batgirl as he combo ender does two hits instead of one but I prefer having it on Scorpion.

My question is this. Is the Batmobile gear useless? I play online mode almost exclusively and almost never get any super's charged up. I usually just use my s2 abilities to win the fights, so is the Batmobile useless? Is it really worth it to charge up enough power to use a super (that will do splash damage) when by that point the fight is almost over and the 1 hit super is less effective than the 4 hit s2 ABB does? 



























































 The title really says it all. I'm logged in right now. Time to make up for lost... uh... time. 





























 Skyrim is my favourite game of all time. I was introduced to the series with the nearly equally amazing Oblivion.

I went back and tried to play Morrowind a couple of times. I hate that game. I hate everything about it. I don't think there's a single aspect I experienced that wasn't done better in Oblivion and Skyrim.

But hey, some people like swinging a sword and having it miss the enemy right in front of them 7 times out of 10, and that's cool, it's not for me though. 




 A solid minute of people screaming. Wish I hadn't watched that. 




 Well, they asked a question. So the question mark is justified. And the answer to the question is likely to make a lot of people very excited, so I'd say the exclamation mark is also warranted. 




  you can't instill a conscience or a moral compass in a creature that wasn't born with one

WAT? You realise most rational people acknowledge that their "moral compass" is attained by reason and empathy right? Babies aren't born with the knowledge that killing someone is wrong, that's why children have to be taught right from wrong. 




 Well. I eat meat, but it's far from being purely for survival purposes. I could easily survive as a vegetarian, but I choose to eat delicious meat.

Should I face harsh punishment for this? 




 Is it really a sneak attack if everyone was expecting some Fallout news sometime this year? 




 This shit. This shit right here is literally the very reason I will NEVER give google or youtube my phone number, no matter how many times they ask and how much they claim it's for security. 




 I thought it was Christmas, Easter, and New Year. I guess the patriotic salute would suggest the 4th of July.

 You don't need a "decent team". Just buy three silver packs and use those cards until you can with the 3rd bracket. 




 Congrats. You got the button equivalent of entering a royal rumble last. 




 Great callback. I like your style. 




 Auditions to find a 4th member for Blue Man Group weren't going well. 




 Or the ones that don't seem to have any meaning. Unless I'm missing something there's one between Sub-Zero and Kung Lao that just, doesn't make much sense (I'm probably missing something).

Kung Lao: A dead man walks.

Sub-Zero: You will feel the chill of winter.

Kung Lao: You have met your demise.

WAT?

 




 Yeah, he's gay dude. 




 I like Sub-Zero's badass statement to Jason:

"Kombat me, fool!" 




 Boy is she barking up the wrong staff. 




 They didn't cripple Sub-Zero, I can now breathe again. 









 My friends drag raced their adder and entity and the entity won repeatedly. This is fully tuned with all the mods installed of course.  




 That may be the case, but it's still embarrassingly small for the task. The major releases on PS4 average at around 25GB, some are even 50GB! And they're mandatory installs.

Then on top of that there's updates, DLC, "free" indie games, shared pictures and videos. It all adds up.

I've had the PS4 for 2 years and I've had to delete stuff to make room for new games twice, that's appalling IMO. I never once reached the capacity of my Xbox 360 or my PS3 320GB HDDs. 




 It's my favourite car in the game. I love the way it looks, the way it sounds, and the way it drives. It's got enough grip to be able to control it, but enough slide so you can have fun with it. And although it's not quite as fast as say, a Zentorno or a Turismo it can hold it's own against those cars, and it's a fraction of the cost.

Love it. 




 Yup. I made a rare misspelling, and I really couldn't be bothered to correct it. Glad you sill knew what I meant.  




 My plan worked.  




 My mistake. I read it as unattractive. Now I see that word isn't in the title, and so my post makes no sense. Damn, got to be more careful in the future. 




 It sure is.

But your claim that the machine will take any HDD that's 7.5mm in height intrigues me and I wish to subscribe to your news letter. Since I've had to clear space on my 500GB HDD twice in the two years I've had the system I might have to look into this.

 this just makes it look less ugly.

Less ugly? Than what? A lepor? 




 How to make your pS4 look like it's got a hideous cyst in one easy step.

Seriously though, I always said the paltry 500gb HDD the PS4 shipped with was embarrassingly small, surely a ploy to get the sales of Sony's HDDs up. 




 It used to mean something. People used to want it because it shows great timing to wait for it to hit red and then get it.

But for the last couple of weeks it's been so fucking easy to get red it defeats the point. There's no challenge, no risk. Hence red is now the third most common flair.

I'm glad I got my orange flair because I had good timing, anyone with a red flair is just seen as someone who waited until it was impossible miss getting it. 




 Genius. 




 I agree with everything you just said, have for a long time. But my question remains. I guess that's the "Greater Good" response in a nutshell. In order for me to agree with you about the problem of evil I first must make the assumption that god follows the laws of logic. and I'm not sure if I can make that assumption. This is why I can't say for sure that he doesn't exist.


Edit: I've just done some reading over at Foxhole atheist regarding greater good theodicies and I have come to this conclusion. If the god of the bible is bound by the laws of logic (and until demonstrated otherwise we have to assume  that he is) then no, he cannot possibly exist.

I guess I'm an agnostic atheist or a gnostic atheist depending on the god in question. Thanks for the education ;)

Have an imaginary internet point that does not exist. 




 I guess.

Have a nice day, man. 




 Fair enough, assuming the god of the bible has the same morality most of us do, which it seems he doesn't.

Can we be sure that what we consider to be evil is the same as what god would consider evil? If god is the supposed author of morality could it be possible that if he does exist, we simply don't see that what he allows to happen is ultimately "good"? God's plan/mysterious ways etc etc.


I can't believe I'm actually arguing for the plausibility of the existence of god.

I feel dirty.



 




  That way I don't know if a God exists, that makes me an agnostic

An agnostic atheist, like me. Agnostic and atheist aren't mutually exclusive. You can have agnostic theists and gnostic atheists.

You don't know if an invisible fairy exists
You don't know if an invisible mammoth exists.
You don't know if an invisible whatever exists.
Should we have names like 'agnostic' for all of these ?

Nope, because the belief in any of those doesn't have real world consequences like believing in a god does. There are laws in various countries around the world that are religiously based, or religiously inspired.

I don't see any fairy laws dictating what people can and can't do. 

Nothing can break them.

People who believe in a god would beg to differ.

Believing in God is scientific ignorance

Of course it is, and yet billions of people still believe. 




 I guess we're talking about the god of the bible. You speak of negative claims and how they don't need to have any kind of backing up. What would you say to "There's isn't not a god"? Or what if someone said "The sun did not rise this morning"? I'd ask them to back up that negative claim.

It's reasonable to make a negative claim without evidence until there IS evidence for the positive claim

Is that not just absence of evidence though? We don't know he does exist, therefore he doesn't. 




 Yes it does. But claiming "God does not exist" as a fact is just as folly as saying "God exists", because you can't (currently) prove either one to be true. 




 There's a difference between not believing a claim, and proposing a counter claim.

I don't believe that there's an invisible fairy dancing on your back, but it's possible to feel your back and tell there's no fairy there. If you then say it's intangible and I have no way of detecting it, I can say I don't believe there's a fairy on your back, but I can't prove there isn't, and so I can't truthfully say that there is literally no dancing fairy on your back, because I can't possibly know that for sure because of the characteristics of the fairy in question i.e. it's undetectable.

The same goes for god. If you say "There is no god", the burden of proof is then on you to prove that your claim is true.

God breaks the laws of physics

How do you know for a fact that there exists no being in existence that can break the laws of physics? Can you prove no such being exists? If you can I'd love to hear it. If you can't, then you can't truthfully claim no such being exists.

and has zero evidence of him existing

[Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_absence)

 




 Well. Someone made a claim, that claim is "God exists."

Have you been convinced that the claim is true? If not, you don't believe. If you've been presented with a claim, the fact that you don't give it any thought doesn't change the fact that you either believe it to be true, or don't believe it.

I agree that right now we can't prove either way whether a god exists or not, but the discussion is still worth having because religion is a large part of many countries, and often can have tangible effects on laws and people under those laws.

You don't have to disprove god to not believe he exists, you simply have to remain unconvinced of the statement's truth. Which I am. 




 OP didn't ask if you knew god existed or not, they asked if you believe.

Agnosticism/gnosticism address what you know (or claim to know).
Atheism/theism address what you believe. 




  That would be illogical.

How so? 




  It makes me wonder what kind of loving God would allow that.

Have you read the Bible? The stuff god supposedly allows is entirely abhorrent. I don't why anyone would want to worship a morally bankrupt fiend like that. 




 There is no God.

Unfortunately you just made a claim, can you back it up with evidence? Reasonably the best anyone can say is "I don't think there is a god." Outright saying "There is no good" places the burden of proof onto you, and if you can be sure there's no god then you must have some pretty compelling evidence.

I'm an atheist by the way. 




 I don't believe for a very simple reason.

Every single claim that a god exists that has ever been posited by anyone in all history has failed to meet it's [burden of proof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophic_burden_of_proof).

Every, single, one. 




 Apostrophes are simple, right?

 How many times do I have to explain this? I'm not saying the video is shit. I'm not saying the video is boring, or unwanted, or lame, or anything like that.

All I am doing (read this next bit carefully because it's the most important part) is disputing OP's claim that this clip took a staggering amount of coordination.

How is this hard to understand? I liked the video. It's cool and amusing, no-one's disputing the quality of the video. I'm disputing the claim OP made as to how difficult this was to pull off.

Perhaps we have differing definitions of the word staggering. My point has been made as clearly as I can possibly make it. 




 The reason I stuck with the GM was because the unbreakable was utterly useless in jumping opponents, in the ice clone will freeze a jumping attack enemy, plus you can still move while its out.  




 I don't think you can. Unless there's a mod that allows you to make all NPC's give the finger.  




 I'm not in an organised crew, nor do I have any friends who still play the game. I also don't have the rockstar director so it would be hard for me to replicate it. This still doesn't mean it takes a staggering amount of coordination. Any half serious crew could manage it with minimal effort.  




 Very good video. Glad to see people uploading videos that actually teach us stuff instead of merely showing us.  




 I started by using the unbreakable variation because it looked the coolest, and no-one uses it. Some guy was watching my stream/coaching me and he said is benefit greatly from making the switch to GM variation. I've never looked back. 

Shame his only costume flair is that dull medallion. I miss the ice mask :( 




 Why not? If the shop is open its open. Obviously people who get in at the last minute and then take their time need a kick up the arse, but if they're quick and speedy I see no problem with it.  




 I'm not saying it isn't cool and amusing, it is. I'm just saying it likely didn't require a staggering amount of coordination.  




 Why does it look like is was taken in the 70's? 




 Not if they're friends/a crew. It would be incredibly easy. If it's randoms then yeah it would be tricky, but I have no doubt that these players are friends and/or part of the same crew, in which case it's not impressive in the least. 




 Genuine miracles.

lol. 




 Is it really stunning though? All they had to do was have one guy say: "OK guys. Let's all look left and give the middle finger for about 5 seconds."

Seems like it would have taken a very small amount of coordination to me. 




 It's a disaster movie... and you thought it was going to be good? 




 Seriously? I wait weeks for the challenge to appear and it's only here for a fucking day? I'm really struggling to think of reasons to keep playing at this point. So much bullshit going on all the time. 




 I just looked to see what I did to unlock him, apparently you get him for reaching rank 50 with a faction.

This is strange because I've reach rank 50 with 3 factions so far, and it took this long to unlock him? Weird.

 I can totally believe it. If "Yummy Mummy" is in the dictionary, anything can be. 




 Still, I just re-watched the trailer (hence the door smashing comment) and it seems pretty true to the gameplay of the final product. It's especially impressive given game trailers of recent years.

Wait, did I just imply that 2012 wasn't a recent year? whatever, you know what I mean ;)

 The Jacqui spamming machine gun move is hard to beat with out a teleport move, at least that's in my experience. 




  You know what they're going to do every single time, and you can beat it easily

As Sub Zero I always have trouble with Full Auto Jacqui machine gun spammers. Sure I can slide, but I need to make it perfect to avoid all the bullets, and that's hard. Sure I can use an EX slide, but then they go right back to spamming. The only way round this that I've found is to duck then quickly step forward and duck again, inching my way towards them. I guess it unnerves them into trying something else and then FFFFFWWOOOOOOOSSHSHHH! slide.

Edit: Downvoted for sharing my experience. Wow, this subreddit continues to display itself as the most hostile one I've been subbed to thus far. 




 How cute, they're small. 




 I don't look for reasons to be upset, the reasons find me. 




 Whoa whoa now, take it Eazy-E. There's no need 2-Chainz the subject like that, and that's the way it is. I wouldn't expect anyone to Bow Wow at my feet.

Oh my tired Akon bones. I knew I shouldn't have been testing out my new DMX at the skate park earlier, those things are Common anyway. I think I'll give it up like I just don't care before I Busta hip or something, then my leg would get all Puffy and I'd have to put a really big Ice Cube on it to dull the T-Pain.

I went to see the Dr. Dre for a check up and he told me there'd be a Diddy fee. Which was nice because I was expecting something B.I.G.

50 Cent is all he charged me, as thanks I bought him a 2-Pac of his favourite beer and a sole Eminem, a blue one. He asked me "How Kanye be doing this for me? I'm just working my Method, Man."

I replied "Pharrell the times you've healed me, made me feel better about myself. The least I can do is Snoop around your facebook page, see what beer and candy you like. It's not like I bought you a Gucci Mane bag or anything."

And then I left. I knew he'd be watching every step I take, and every move I make, and I knew today was gonna be a good day.

Iggy Azalea. 




  but you could've went in expecting a little more because of the amount of hype around it.

The same can be said about anything people praise. It's nearly impossible to hear everyone raving about something and not build up some expectations in your mind. 




 I've seen different bosses have different sized health bars. I'm assuming they have millions of HP and everyone has to fight as much as they can to collectively drain the health bar before the invasion is over.

That's how it seems to me. 




 He was a character on Noel Edmond's House Party. I'm assuming you're not from Britain, it was a pretty big Saturday (or Sunday) night show over here back in the 90's. Everyone loved it.

Sometimes Mr Blobby would show up and basically harass Noel, much to the audience's amusement. Looking back on it though, my parents must have fucking hated every second the pink freak was on TV, but us kids loved it.

Just watch this episode I just found and you'll see what we had to put up with on the weekend. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leSGbxejtvw 




 Whenever I'm in a fast car and the cops are doing their keeping up bullshit I just look behind me, throw a sticky bomb out the window, and solve the problem. 




 Because I find the whole thing to be ridiculous. It's ludacris. 




 I know how you feel. I think the whole concept is ridiculous anyway.

"Look at how much money I have! Look at all the women I paid to be in my video! HUr durr!"

Seriously, who's impressed by the showing off rappers do? 




 I wholeheartedly and unabashedly LOL at everyone who was waiting expecting to be rewarded.

Should have pressed the button you fools. 




 But what about the hype of literally every person who's seen it? I've heard nothing but "It's the best action movie in years!" from everyone. 




 'twas all the rage when I was a kid. He hails from Crinkley Bottom. I'm not making this up. 




 Me too. I was all like "Wow, it's cool seeing so much of Outworld. This whole war between Kotal Khan and Mileena is going to be... welp, rebellion's over." 




 [Mr Blobby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XutaTTNihe0) 




 Arkham Origins rated games? That'll not make Rocksteady happy. 




 People still have trouble with raven? Get her below 50% health and hit her with a super move.

Literally problem solved. 




 I'm willing to do something 99% of my console gaming brethren are too afraid to do.

Acknowledge that PC is objectively the superior gaming platform. 




 Don't let me go belly up! 




 They finally pulled their fingers out and released challenge mode? I might have to start playing again. Frankly I'm amazed at how quickly I got bored of this game considering I played Injustice almost every day for nearly two years. 




 I remember when this game first came out and everyone was equating the cops with Ed-209 from Robocop, on account of how dangerous they were compared to the cops in GTAIV.

Now we're all accustomed to their ways it's gotten pretty easy to make them look foolish/take them down without issue. Good job OP. You showed those fucks who owns the streets! 




 TIL welling up equates to breaking down, if OP is to be believed. 




 It's funny. When I initially started going for the trophy I thought it was insanely hard. It's cool to see so many different tactics being employed to achieve the same goal. 




 Sorry if this is old news or there's better known ways of landing hits on the invasion bosses. I just found a tactic that worked for me and wanted to share it with people who might be having trouble, like I was. 









 Yes. Everyone. James himself even said people say he looks like House.  




 People who can do this have my respect. I'm a pretty decent pilot in GTA, and I've never successfully flown upside down through a tunnel. 

And I've tried.  




 I've been told by several people that the price of building a PC in the UK is much higher than for US gamers. If I want to play games at 4K I'm looking at around 700, more than double a PS4's cost.  




 Oh yeah, that thing. Thanks for clarifying.  




 What? 




 Not everyone wants/likes/can afford to play in PC. It's all well and good claiming PC gaming is cheaper in the long run but there's still the hurdle of the steep entry fee. 

But I guess this all moo because we'll never know.  




 What is this? r/nocontext 




 It's fine. You just have to be careful. You can turn on the spot if you're careful. 




 The game's been out for nearly 2 years and you learned this today? 




  If we eliminated that, we would have the same amount of gamers with better systems

Or you would have fewer gamers. You can't possibly state one way or the other. 




 I may be late, but 141 people enjoyed the post. And I never said Kotal wasn't a better character, I enjoy listening to him talk. 




 [It's a Simpsons quote.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlMwc1c0HRQ) 




 You know much of Outworld. 




  To be fair though, people are fucking idiots. 




 Hmm. Your ideas intrigue me, and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter. 




 Upvoted for Herperlarp. 




 You'll forgive me if I haven't thought about Ogre for many years and so he wasn't at the forfront of my memory. 




 I find that sort of thing seems to be pretty frowned upon in /r/mortalkombat 

A lot of people seem really hostile in this subreddit, at least in my experience. 




 I understand. Outworld law states that the offending party be subjected to hanging their head in shame for no less than 15 seconds. 

**hangs head in shame** 




 I though he was a sun/blood God.  




 I wouldn't be surprised if they were both based on than.  




 Thanks! Stan Lee once said every comic is somebody's first time reading one. I think the same can be said for most posts to reddit. 




 He's "The God of Fighting". He's pretty powerful. 




 I get that many people do. I was just saying that I don't. I know nothing about Dota 2, that's probably why I didn't recognise him. Thanks for the clarification. 




 Just noticed the spelling mistake in the title. Sorry guys. 




 I have no idea who that is. 




 But that isn't even Ogre's final form! 




 Well it's the first time I've seen it posted to reddit. Sorry for lacking the ability to see every post made to the MK subreddit. 




 Takeda isn't exactly my main. And I dropped a few combos here I shouldn't have, but it's still pretty tricky to go two rounds without being hit at all, even blocking.

Sorry I'm not MLG like yourself. 









 Are these comics canon with the games? 









 Nice. Loving the Noob rep also. 




 I just spotted the time played. I'm pretty sure I've played more than 2 horus and 50 minutes lol. Unless that's 2 days and 50 hours. 




 Yeah. I once went to bed and woke up with a higher rank, that's why I'm not sure how accurate the rank is. 









 Username checks out. 




 Of course. I keep forgetting games on PC are much cheaper. 




 Good to know, thanks. 




 Don't worry. You won't be seeing that kind of post from me again lol. 




 Yeah sorry for my snarky reply earlier. A little understandable given your comment but my attitude wasn't necessary. I had a quick scan of your past comments to see if you're a dick but it looks like you're a decent guy, that's why I feel bad for being an ass to you earlier. 




 Cool. Thanks for clarifying. 




 Ok. Sorry to be dragging down the community by asking a question. I'll be sure to delete this post so I avoid making this subreddit go to shit any more than it supposedly has.

Note to self. Don't ever ask the Reddit MK community a question ever again. They apparently hate that shit. 




 Telling me to block everything the enemy throws at me is much easier than actually blocking everything. 




 Thanks for the tips. I main Sub-Zero so I usually slide in after the minion instead of running.

Also, fuzzy block? 




 No. I understand the benefit of knowing one's enemy. I'm just saying that if I'm going to learn a character I might as well use them. 




 If all they do is teleport then yeah, easy. The people I fight do much more than teleport. 




 And you clearly haven't read the comments. If you had you'd have seen that this issue has been remedied. I should probably delete this post then shouldn't I? 




 I do use the blocking mechanic. But there's this other mechanic called mix-ups. They kinda make it hard to block sometimes. And once you're hit, that's it, 34% of your life bar, gone, because a little tap to the foot opened you up. 




 There's no way I'd put the time and effort into learning a character and then just not use them. 




 Yeah man. I rarely lol when I'm alone. It's usually just the huff of air out the nostrils.

But I lol'd twice during this and thought, that's redditworthy. 









 Thanks. That mouse looks awesome. Lights for some reason! 




 Just thought of a question. I looked at a review video for the monitor and it seems a little, small. I'm used to gaming on a TV that I think is pushing the 48 inch range. I could always buy a bigger monitor later, but is hooking the PC up to my TV a viable option? People always tell me it's a thing you can do but when I hook my laptop up to the TV the picture quality seems to drop. 




 Thanks for the info. I read that I don't want a weak CPU because it can slow down the GPU, is this much of an issue?

Also I keep hearing the term benchmark but don't know what that is in terms of computing.  




 Yeah I suppose if I learned his moves of be better equipped to fight him. I've just been avoiding learning him because everyone uses him and I don't want to add to that. And if I know him I have to use him, that's the law.  




 Thanks man, this is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for. I'll be keeping this somewhere safe. 




 Thanks man, this is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for. I'll be keeping this somewhere safe. 




 Oh yeah. I always forget about the online fees since I've been paying them for so long. 




 Ah yes. I see the rule you mean now. This is how much of a noob I am. I assumed /r/buildapcforme was where people would literally build a pc to the specs you ask for, and /r/buildapc was where people suggested builds for you. Now I know. 




 Here's the new post for you to follow if you wish.

http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/36uuvt/absolute_noob_finally_making_the_jump_from/ 




 **What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

I want to play games that look better than on my PS4 (Witcher 3, GTAV, that sort of thing). Ultra settings would be nice but I have no idea how expensive that is, so high would suffice if the cost is over my budget. I'd also like to do some light video editing and rendering using Sony Vegas.

**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

700

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

I don't know when I'll be buying. I'm looking to get an idea of what I'll be buying since I know nothing about the innards of PCs.

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

This will be from scratch so I guess I'd need a tower, OS, one monitor, speakers, keyboard, mouse. Not sure what else I'd need.

**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

England.

**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

None.

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

I have no idea. I guess so. I thought everyone overclocked gaming PCs.

**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

"RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL" I don't know what any of that is. I'd like an SSD but they're mega expensive. I'd need at least 2TB of storage for all the games I reckon.

**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

Not yet. Just trying to get an idea of what I need. 

**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**

I guess I'll need windows. I've got 8.1 on my laptop but I much preferred 7, that metro stuff is just annoying. Is there a benefit to using older versions?

**Extra info or particulars:**

I am a noob. Please remember this when saying things like "Radeon 9500 GTX" and "i7 quad core". 




 The second rule I see is:

No facilitating piracy, linking to pirated software or tools to pirate software

I guess there's more than 1 set of rules? But yeah, I'm going to post this over at /r/buildapcforme as suggested by another redditor. 
 




 I'm going to post it in /r/buildapcforme because someone suggested it would be better off there. I'll give you the link once I've posted it. 




 Cool. Thanks for letting me know. I'll post it there. 




 Let's assume the PC version ran just as well as the console versions. What would be the advantage of getting the PC version? I know the advantage to PC versions of most games (better graphics, higher framerate, mods etc) but since MKX looks great on consoles and runs at 60fps, what's the advantage to the PC version? 




 That's strange. I never say things like Dat Ass because I think it's dumb. But I see so many top comments saying dat ass I figured it was something people enjoyed reading. But of course. I made the mistake of thinking reddit makes sense, so when I say it, downvotes, when other people say it, upvotes.

Fuck reddit sometimes.  




 Cool. Me too.  




 Which Soul Calibur game was Kratos in? I only know of:

Soul Calibur 2: Xbox = Spawn
PS2 = Heihachi
Gamecube = Link

and Soul Calibur 4.

PS3 = Darth Vader
Xbox 360 = Yoda

and Soul Calibur V

All versions = Ezio. 




  I just play wired for a bit.

Nothing like a bit of retro gaming lol. 




 Yeah, sorry for my dickish comment. I've become everything I used to hate about reddit lol. 




 That's terrible. 




 When you put it like that, it does seem kind of oxymoronic. I was just angry when I started the post and chilled out near the end. 




 Fair enough. 




 Yup. She became a gamer around the time she bought an Xbox 360 in 2010 ish. She keeps surprising me. She owns a Five Finger Death Punch Album... she's 55. She loves playing games like Skyrim, Fallout, and most recently, X-Com Enemy Unknown and she just finished Deus Ex Human Revolution.

It's cool. 




 Noice! 




 I'm sure the Xbox One controllers do have a great life span. I know the Xbox 360 did, but then again the tradeoff was that you had to buy batteries and keep swapping them out when they need charging. With my PS4  I have a dock that holds two controllers. When one gets low on power I simply turn it off, place it down, pick up the other one and keep playing. I will agree that the battery life on the PS4 controllers is embarrassingly short, but 4 hours is doing it a disservice. 




 It's almost as if the stuff bundled with collector's editions of games is cheap tat!

I remember when my Mum opened her collector's edition of Elder Scrolls Online and pulled out the statue of Molag Bal. A statue we'd assumed would have been made from metal given the price of the fucking package.

NOPE.

It was cheap as fuck plastic. I've heard the same from people with other collector's editions. This is why I don't buy collector's editions. Mostly because I don't want the shit that comes with them, I just want the game, but partly because I've been nothing but underwhelmed with what I've seen so far.

Did anyone get the collector's edition of Black Ops with the RC-XD? Or the CE of Modern Warfare 2 with the night vision goggles? what was the build quality like on those? Also the Scorpion statue with MKX.
