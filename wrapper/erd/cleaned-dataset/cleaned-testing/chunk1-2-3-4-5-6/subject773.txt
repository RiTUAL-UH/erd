 Well there is certainly no rush!  I'm just thrilled that you're working on it.  Can't wait to hear what you've come up with! 




 I love his tummy spot -- perfect for scratching and kisses!  I had a rat as well, who is no longer with us, but rats are awesome! 




 This is my plan B career. 




 Tongue is one of my favorite foods.  This ad makes me wish I could go to the store RIGHT NOW and buy some.  No joke. 




 I cannot upvote this enough.  Huzzah for you! 




 Please do!  Apollo is sitting here with me right now, and it's just so...quiet.  If only there was some sort of song playing... ;) 




 I noticed that too!  I'm guess that since the horse in question was a yearling, they are using the term "pony" incorrectly to mean a young horse.  Do some research people! 




 Oh I do hope it is!  Thank you!!! 




 Thank you GreivisIsGod!  Glad people are getting excited about this.  Maybe I'll get several submissions and Apollo can have different themes depending on his mood. :D 




 Maybe you can team up with someone?  You could do the words and music, and they could sing it for you?  Heck, even if you can't sing well, do it anyway!  Silly songs don't need perfect voices! 




 The dog in question is Apollo, a springer spaniel/golden retriever mix. I often sing to him about his greatness, his beauty, and his strength, but I'm no songwriter, and I think he deserves an anthem of sorts. I know that a song about Apollo would make my boyfriend incredibly happy, so this is a surprise of sorts for him!

First off, here are some photos of Apollo for inspiration: http://pineappleblurt.imgur.com/apollo#38wmp

Now, some Apollo facts:

- I often sing of how he crunches the bones of his enemies, and that he is the destroyer of Tirmok, and had pillaged and burned many villages and thatched roofed cottages.

- Apollo loves the water. He also loves tennis balls, bones, eating, and his eternal love -- our neighbor Deb.

- According to Apollo, no one ever feeds him. Dinner time for him is all the time.

- He was named not for the god Apollo, but for Apollo from Battlestar Galactica.

- He has a superhero alter ego named DarkFart, who fights crime under the cover of darkness.

This doesn't have to be an original melody. Something epic sounding, like the Soviet national anthem, would be incredible. Silly lyrics, about Apollo's unrivaled awesomeness, strength, and beauty, are a must. :D

Forward songwriters! I hope someone accepts my challenge! If I end up with an mp3 of a song all about Apollo, I'll be the happiest girl alive.

Edit: formatting 




 Thanks!  I shall cross post as suggested. 




 That is excellent!  Thanks for the info.  Also, I upvote this not just for the help, but also for the hilarious name of the website. 




 This is so exciting, yokaishingami!  Thank you!

 I have some things!  Most of my shirts are XS or S, and I do have 1 or 2 sized pants and dresses.  Let me raid my closet and see what I can find for you.   




 They are all so cute! 




 How exactly do you get out there? 




 I feel for you.  This March I got some bad sunburn while wearing an earflap hat and large sunglasses.  It looked...interesting. 




 My friend is going to have a boy in August!  She and her husband aren't terribly "in need", but they are grad students, so things aren't all sunshine and lollypops either!  Can you message me your email address and I can put them in contact with you if they are interested?  They aren't Redditors. 




 The Bulldog, either in St. Paul or NE Minneapolis.  Super tater tots too! 




 Thanks for the info you guys!  I didn't have much time to look around while I was at the show, but I did get to the American Saddlebred Museum and the Barn of Champions (got to meet Cigar!).  It was a great show venue and we had a great show!  Check it out: https://www.shaneshifletphoto.com/dspProofImage.asp?width=1210 show=2011%20Bluegrass%20Morgan\Saturday%20Morning\128%20-%20Hunter%20Pleasure%2C%20Ladies%2C%20Championship image=128-061-11BM.JPG
 




 Hmmm...I find this silly. 




 How does 143 mean I love you? 




 Ah!  SQUEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!! 




 Nice outfit, Riblet!  Also, GREAT dog name, knaps! 




 Your daughter is seriously cute.  Cutest kid I've seen in a long time! 




 I hope you guys do this again another time.  I'm out of town this week, but I'd love to bring my dog at some point! 




 Thanks for the info.  I'm going for the Bluegrass Morgan Classic -- I know there are several shows going on at the same time at the Horse Park this weekend.  There is going to be so much to see, and probably not enough time to see it all! 




 I have Morgans too!  Nice to know another Morgan Redditor! 




 I'll be heading down this week to Lexington for a show at the Horse Park.  It's my first time there, and there is so much to see!  I know I won't have lots of time in between showing my horse, so for those of you who have been there, what were your favorite things?  What should I skip?   I'm for sure checking out the Saddlebred museum, and I'd like to see some of the famous horses there. 




 What is the difference between "yellow" and "lemon"? 




 I liked Mirror of Korea ok, but when I ordered the Bibimbap they COOKED THE EGG YOLK ALL THE WAY THROUGH.  The runny yolk is what makes that dish! 




 He is wonderful!  You should crosspost this on r/equus. 




 Are you kidding?  I WOULD LOVE THIS!  Do they make them for big kids? 




 Yeah, I don't live there anymore -- now I'm in Minneapolis.  But I still go back to Roscoe quite often to visit my folks. 




 Sweet!  Roscoe is represented on Reddit!   




 Is that Hononegah high school? 




 NOT a stupid question!  I do mine damp (wet and rung out).  Not sure what would happen if you do it dry...let's not find out. 




 Also related, you can kill all the nasties on a sponge by zapping it in the microwave for 2 minutes.  Careful -- resulting sponge will be hot and steamy. 




 Merrils are awesome!  Another way to take care of your feet while still being frugal is to get a pair of prescription orthodics crafted by a podiatrist.  While the initial investment is pricey ($200?) they last for-freakin-ever (they are made of a material called Superglass, a type of fiberglass).  I got some 10 years ago because I have extremely high arches and it was killing my knees to walk.  Now they go in all the shoes I wear (except heels) and it really don't matter if I buy cheaper shoes that have no arch support (like Converse) because my orthodics are in there.  Any shoes I want, and no knee pain! 




 Shoes.  Buy good shoes.  If you buy crappy shoes you will mess up your feet over time and when you mess up your feet, you mess up the rest of you (knees, hips, back, etc.)  

I buy all my clothes secondhand, but always purchase top quality shoes! 




 Enchilada bake is the best freakin' thing ever.  Get an 8x8 pan and open a can of enchilada sauce.  Put a little bit of sauce in the bottom so things don't stick, and begin layering -- tortilla, black beans, cheese, sauce, tortilla, beans, cheese sauce, etc. until you get to the top of the pan (usually about 3 layers).  Then top it off with any leftover sauce and cheese and throw it in the oven.  350 for...I don't know...25 minutes?  You know, until it's bubbly and hot-looking and done.  

Hella tasty, impossible to mess up, cheap to make, and great for lunches. 




 I am also building credit, and I only use my card for groceries.  Even if I don't put much on it, I'm paying it off in full each month, and therefore build credit.  I have a Chase Sapphire card along with a Chase rewards debit card (I bank with them, but they have credit cards available in general).  Also, the US Bank Flex Perk cards are very highly ranked. 




 D'AWWWWWWW!  Darling!
 




 My dad convinced his secretary that bison dig holes in the ground to live in while they hibernate in the winter.  I convinced this same woman that a local water tower was actually a hot air balloon. 




 Your dog is darling.  What is he/she? 




 I had one of these guys too.  We named him Earl the Squirrel.  I found out upon bringing him to the Wildlife Rehab Center that squirrels of this age (just out of the nest) don't really understand danger and routinely approach people, just like Ruppert did.  Earl did the same to me, hopping onto my foot and looking scared.  You would think squirrels would have evolved a better sense of fear after all these years.  Nevertheless, Earl was super fun to have.  We used to nap on the couch together and watch Jeopardy.   




 Folding myself in half backwards, and other contortionist-like abilities. 




 I've had this all my life but never knew it had a name!  I have asked eye doctors about it, but none of them have ever told me about visual snow.  Makes it incredibly difficult to see at night, especially things like holes in the ground while walking in the dark.  Glad to know it's a real thing, and I'm not just completely insane. 




 Thanks!  Wish this topic would make it to the front page -- I want to see more pictures of people's horses! 




 Guys always laugh when I tell them how sexy I think forearms are, and yet here we are, so many of us loving forearms.  Especially when the guy is wearing a plaid shirt with the sleeves rolled up.  *drool* 




 I'm just finding this thread now, and I'm thrilled there is a subreddit for horses!  Here are my two Morgans, Baby (chestnut) and Rillo (bay).  Baby is Rillo's mom, so it's a family affair when we show!

http://pineappleblurt.imgur.com/3GH12#49hIR 




 Just found this subreddit now!  Some great Saddlebred magazines are:

Saddle and Bridle - http://www.saddleandbridle.com/
The National Horseman - http://www.tnh1865.com/
Saddle Horse Report - http://www.saddlehorsereport.com/

Also, this is a complete list of books written specifically about Saddlebreds: http://www.trot.org/forum/showthread.php?t=2158 however many of these you would have to find used/vintage.

From a fellow Saddlebred lover, I hope this helps! 
























 Cute overload. 




 I love that you call him "The Chew".  My friends dog looks nothing like Chewbacca, but can make the Chewbacca noise on command.  It. Is. AWESOME. 




 He is beautiful!  And his face looks so wise. :) 




 I do wish that I had seen this about 3 month ago.  I really wanted to live in that direction.  Alas, too late! 




 Cool!  And I also hope that there are some LA firms there.  I'll try to check it out if I can get over there after word, and will spread the word among the grad students! 




 Hey lady_elayne!  Nice to know I'm not alone!  You should PM me and tell me ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL about your Saddlebreds!  I'm a Morgan girl myself, but I've ridden and shown my share of Saddlebreds and Hackneys as well. 




 Thank you!  And no, you didn't sound too "judge-y". :)  




 Sorry to confuse, captainstag!  And you're right, just like anything (even riding in general) it can be done well and to the advantage of the horse, or poorly to the ultimate disadvantage of the horse. 




 Ah I see.  Since I'm a Morgan person, I'm more on the "fewer aids" side of the camp too.  And yes, the clump of dirt!  Always a big hit with my horse too.  But ohhhhh the dreaded baby powder bottle...all you have to do is pick it up!  He clearly thinks it's going to eat him. XD 




 Oh man, my horse LOVES the fire extinguisher -- he thinks it's hilarious. :)

And to answer your question, I show Morgans.

What do you mean when you say that Arabs are one of the more natural breeds?  Do you mean for saddleseat?  Because my view was always that the Arabs were the most unnatural saddleseat horses, simply because their motion (historically) was to move with lower action and a sweeping stride to cross desert sands efficiently, not to step high and raise the knees.  I know that they are now breeding for the bend at the knee, but I don't know how true it is to the breed's origins.  Your opinions? 




 I'd love to know what you do to your soil to get those nice onions!  We have onions, but they are always small and never get to be the nice, large onions we would like.  Doesn't matter which variety we try, they are always puny. 




 Well, the equitation is completely different - so comparing a saddleseat rider to a hunter/jumper rider is like comparing apples and oranges.  To effectively ride our horses we need to sit back, legs away from our horse's sides, hands elevated.  Saddleseat equitation should look like this: http://www.discoverhorses.com/saddle-seat-equitation.html  Of course, there are people out there that ride like this (ick):http://www.uphaonline.com/images/charming.jpg

If course, the same goes for any discipline. I founded and formed an equestrian team at my college and was the only non-jumper person.  I was SHOCKED at the lack of ability in most of the riders.  So many of them were pushed to jump before they really had developed a seat.  I think this is why jumping is seen as "dangerous", simply because people haven't really learned how to "sit" yet.

And yes, I've done LOTs of cross-training.  My mare transitioned to huntseat years ago, so for the past several years I've been riding both Saddleseat and Huntseat, and I've had to develop two different forms of equitation depending on which horse I'm riding.  I've also done hunter/jumper stuff in college, some dressage, and LOTS of driving.  I think everyone should take a "vacation" from their discipline and try something else for a few months!  It's so helpful.  

You can judge my equitation for yourself if you like, I'm by no means an "equitation rider" and was never trained as one, but this is how I sit when I ride huntseat.  http://i.imgur.com/jFVcm.jpg 




 I can't follow you captainstag.  What about horses that wear Easyboots?  Do you think that horses shouldn't wear shoes at all?  Show horses' longer feet and weighted shoes cause no ill effects.  Many show horses compete into their 20's and are completely sound.  I wish I had a picture of my horse's feet -- they're really not that much longer than your average horse.

I do think that the TWHs stress out their horse's joints in the "big lick" division.  Those shoes are huge, heavy, and throw the entire stance of the horse off.  AND they ride two year olds that way!  Those horses are too often crippled before they hit 10.  So sad. 




 No, he only wears it in the summer, and that's only on days leading up to a show.  Also, it's it really hot we just leave it off.   




 Hey FlameGirl!  I'll go through these one by one:

1) You can do some things to encourage head and neck position, but most of all the horse has to be built for it.  My horse is not, that is is why he because a hunter and not a saddleseat-type horse.  However, assuming the horse is upheaded to begin with, the upheadedness and head carriage come from a) building muscle and b) collection.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Dumb jockeys are used, taking the place of a rider when a horse isn't being ridden.  They help teach a horse the proper "frame" to be in.  When we ride, our hands are elevated to meet the elevation of our horse's head and neck.  While riding, you can bump and tickle your snaffle bit to ask the horse to keep his head up.  Of course, none of this is possible without good impulsion from the hind end.  When a horse pushes off its hind end, it elevates its front end.  There are plenty of horse that go around the ring with their head down because they are not collected and pushing off the hind!  

2) I don't know much about rollkur.  I've never seen it used outside of dressage. :/

3) The rider sitting farther back on the horse does not have any ill effects on the horse's back.  Morgans, Saddlebreds, etc. have a center of gravity that is in the middle of their back (they are built in an upright fashion) as opposed to a thoroughbred or quarter horse whose center of gravity is over the shoulders.  The saddles are designed to sit in the middle of the horse's back and the flaps are cut back to free up the horse's shoulders and not impede their movement.

4) Whips are used pretty much like they are in any other discipline I suppose.  Lots of riders show without whips.  I rarely use them, even at home when training.  Sometimes they are carried as a "prop", especially in equitation classes, and I carry one in the ring sometimes because my horse tends to focus and listen better if I'm holding it.  Otherwise, it's just an aid, as it is with anything else.

5)  Many Saddlebreds and Hackneys have had their tail "set".  In other words, a muscle in the underside of the tail has been cut to allow the tail to stretch up and bend over at the top.  Some people think that the tail bone is broken, which is not the case (and would be awful!).  My horse is a Morgan, so this type of procedure is illegal for our breed.  He does, however, wear a bustle in his stall to encourage an "arched" tail carriage.  Desired Morgan tail carriage looks like this: http://www.playmorfarm.com/Play_mor_farms_stallions/stallion_images/centerpiece-thumb-2010-2.jpg  Desired Saddlebred tail carriage looks like this: http://www.goinggaited.com/Born_Contender_al_12-4-06.jpg

Feel free to ask follow up questions! 




 The topics that always come up with "abuse" in the saddleseat world generally has to do with several things: shoeing, soring, and training aids.

1) Saddleseat horses wear weighted shoes, and their hooves are grown out longer than, say, a thoroughbred's hooves.  Many people see this as strange because their horses don't have feet like this, and thing that a) the shoes are heavy and hurt the horse and that b) the hooves lose the proper angle when they are grown out and it is detrimental to the horse's legs.  The shoes are, in actuality, quite light.  We have to realize that we're dealing with a 1000 lb animal, and the shoes weigh a matter of ounces.  Also, when the hooves are grown out longer, proper angles HAVE to be maintained for the horse to be sound and happy, so it's actually very important to keep the angles correct.  Of course there are crappy farriers out there, but that can happen to any horse of any breed/discipline.  It is also important to point out that hoof length and shoe length are strictly regulated -- every time I leave the ring after a class there is a steward there measuring my horse's hooves, making sure we are within the regulations. 

2) People often think that Saddlebreds, Morgans, National Show Horses, etc. are "sored" in the fashion that some Tennessee Walking Horses are.  In the TWH world, some trainers (not all) apply chemicals to the legs of the horses that burn or cause pain, causing the horse to lift its legs high to try and get away from the sensation.  It's abusive, but it does work, and the reason it works for TWHs is that they are gaited (meaning they perform a running walk) and do not perform a trot.  A sored horse will look lame at the trot (because they are).  Therefore, soring for trotting breeds is irrational.  Even a Saddlebred that can perform the two extra "gaited horse" gaits (the slow-gait and rack) still have to trot in the show ring, and a sored horse would stick out like, well, a sore thumb.  I do not condone what is done to the Walking Horses, and will never be about to understand how the owners and riders of these horses can put their horses through this and still say they love them.  

3) Training aids used in the saddleseat world are things like stretchies and chains.  Stretchies are simply a length of rubber surgical tubing that is connected between the horses front legs to provide resistance.  They look like this: http://i.imgur.com/vpc0W.jpg.  Have you done this at the gym? http://www.health.com/health/static/hw/media/medical/hw/h9991377_001_02.jpg  It works the same way, building up the chest and shoulder muscles of the horse -- this can create a higher step through improving muscle tone.  Some horses, like my horse, don't use them -- they take short steps to avoid them, basically looking at me and saying "yeah...whatever". :)  As for chains, they are places like bracelets around the horse's ankles, and again, encourage a higher step.  The combination of a bit of weight (think ankle weights) plus the looseness of the chain (the chain flings forward when the horse trots, and carries the foot a bit with it, creating a higher, more open step).  Here is a picture of a horse trotting wearing chains.  You can see how the chain is flinging forward on her hind leg http://morganshowcase.com/Listing.php?HorseName=Wonderful%20Tonight Page=Photo Order=4.  Some folks think that these chains are exceptionally heavy, but really, they're just chains.  Perhaps like one you'd lock up your bike with.  Kids put them on their feet at horse shows and pretend to be "show horses" all the time.  There is also the misconception that the chains bang onto the horses feet causing as "soring" effect.  Again, soring a trotting horse doesn't work, and moreover this is not an effect of using chains.  Some chains come coated, padded, or are wrapped to prevent any sort of injury from occurring, and many horses get worked with their legs wrapped and boots on.  An added bonus of riding a horse wearing chains is that they jingle, and it's a good exercise for riders to listen to the rhythm of the chains to determine their horse's stride, cadence, and speed.

Wowzers, that got long!  Thanks for your questions CaptainCorpsie! 




 Hello fellow Reddit equestrians!  I have been constantly seeing forum after forum of people blogging, posting, and ranting about "show horse abuse" in all disciplines, and one that always arises are the Saddleseat horses.  I read the comments, I look at the examples, and generally people who make negative comments are doing so because they're not sure what the discipline is all about, and don't understand the training, riding, and showing of these horses.  

Also, many people don't know what Saddleseat is at all, which is understandable since it's sort of a small world compared to the western and hunter circuits.

So here I am, a saddleseat rider putting myself out there.  AMA!!! 




 You're welcome! 




 Well, marathons ARE very impressive! :D  So yes, maybe you do have HMS, but isn't it great that someone could basically throw you off a building?  I have video of me getting thrown very hard off of a horse and when I hit the ground, I bounce. 




 aaaaaaaaaand that looks like me. 




 I was, and still am, that girl. 




 Some people with HMS can certainly still run, it's just not one of the things I'm able to do.  I wouldn't rush into the doctor, but next time you go in for a check up you might want to mention it.  They may look at you right there, or if you like, you could have them refer you to a rhumatologist (that's who diagnosed me).  

The back pain may be unrelated, as many people have back pain, but the sprains and dislocations could be a sign of HMS.  Have you ever broken a bone?  I tend to sprain/dislocate in situations where other people may break (falling off horses, having a horse fall on top of me, etc.).  I wonder if you are the same.

Also, it's AWESOME that you compete in marathons -- something I would love to be able to do! 




 Fortunately, I do not have the life-shortening form of Ehlers.  The rarer forms are quite debilitating and deadly.  And yes, I have very soft and stretchy skin.  I have a huge wenis! http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wenis 




 I can and I do!  I can't do some things -- like if I do pushups I basically dislocate my shoulders, but I do squats, flys, presses, etc.  It actually helps to do some strength training because it builds up muscle around the joints which helps them stabilize. 




 I'm worried about having kids for this very reason, and also because I'm afraid I'll pass on the HMS to my children.  I score a 7, so we're pretty close in the regard.  What exactly happened when you were pregnant? 




 I can't tell you what the difference is, and there is a recent study that shows they aren't different at all.  There are several types of Ehlers Danlos, and hypermobility is one of the types.  I do have the elastic skin, and I break blood vessels and veins all the time.  I bruise like a ripe peach too, so I never know what exactly to call what I have.  I just stick with calling it "hypermobility".   




 Oh yes, it is ALL about the impact.  The elliptical machine at the gym and I are BFFs. 




 The best way to be!  Now go freak out all of your friends!!! 




 I have been diagnosed by a doctor.  I was diagnosed when I was about 13 or 14. 




 Those are definitely the two camps that people split into!  Typically, people who are into medicine are in the "ooooOOOOOoooo" camp and most other people are in the "OH GOD MAKE IT STOP" camp.  My boyfriend is used to it, but I think it still freaks him out on occasion -- especially the hands.

I don't demonstrate very often, and I do think there is something to be said for the theory that demonstrating makes things go bad faster.  You keep stretching and stretching every time you do it, so at the very least, you're not making things any better.  But yeah, I do it in my sleep, and there are also things I do that I figured were normal, and apparently aren't.  I scared the crap out of a yoga instructor once. :)

As for the running vs. biking, for me it's definitely not an issue of fitness.  I work out and my recovery time is amazing, but once I start to run, all kinds of shit starts to go down.  Basically, when I run and my body is subjected to the impact of the running motion, my legs can't hold themselves together.  So then my muscles try to compensate for the loose joints and overtax *themselves* and then my heart begins to work overtime trying to get blood and oxygen to the muscles.  My doctor told me to not take up regular running, as it may overtax my heart.  




 One other idea is to go the the Red Stag Supperclub on Tuesdays, which is their "Cheap Date Night".  Two entrees, a bottle of wine, and two desserts for $32, and the atmosphere is wonderful.  A nicer place where you could dress up a bit and make an occasion out of it.  Call ahead for reservations though, the deal is very popular! 




 I went into the doctor thinking I had juvenile arthritis.  When she found no sign of that, she started putting me through flexibility tests and basically tied me into a knot on her exam table.  She got it right on the nose that it was HMS, but other doctors thought it was just "growing pains" even though I hadn't grown in years, or didn't have an explanation.  Not many docs I've meant know about it, and so I educate every medical student I run into about HMS!  I sat next to one on the plane and we started talking about it -- he had just studied it in class and was fascinated that he was sitting next to a living embodiment of his textbook!   




 I found out about the name ON REDDIT!  Hooray for Reddit!  And yes, you are not alone. :D 




 Thanks for pointing out that this is serious, dizzysparrow.  While it is entertaining, there is quite a bit of pain associated with it.  I partially dislocate things all the time -- they often pop back in on their own shortly after, but that doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.   I've also sprained my left ankle 18 times, usually just by walking down the sidewalk, and my right 13 times.  This to me is "normal".  

As for how it effects my daily life, it depends.  I cannot hold a pen for very long, so I take all notes on my laptop when I'm in classes.  Winter is the hardest -- my hands and legs stiffen up and I have problems holding onto things and moving my fingers.  I was in a drawing class this winter where I had to hold a pen for hours.  I would have to come home at night and use hot packs on my hands to ease the pain.  Of course there is the obvious -- I can't run, so fun co-ed sports are out (mostly) and I have to invest in a gym membership to stay fit since I can't just go running (though I do bike in the summer).  I believe that the worst thing about HMS is that people can't tell you have it, and therefore can't understand why you hurt or think you are "whiny".  If you looked at me walking down the street, I look no different than most people aside from a slight limp I sometimes have.  You cannot always see pain. 




 ZOMG BENDY ZOMBIES!!! 




 Interesting to know.  I read that myopia can be related, so I figure that it could be a lack of strength in the eye tissues causing it, but since they're not sure what causes visual snow, who knows? 




 I am really good at goofing-off wrestling!  Someone thinks they have me pinned and then BAM!, I'm bent in half backwards giving them an epic wedgie. 




 It may, or you may just be flexible.  Do you have the associated chronic pain?  Or are you just delightfully bendy? 




 My pain did not subside when I finished growing that I can remember, but my pain also got worse when I was 13 or 14.  I stopped growing when I was 11, so I hadn't even hit puberty yet.  I'm really not sure how your son will be effected, but my doctor believes that as my body naturally tightens up with age (the way normal people become "stiff" with old age), I will simply become more normal and the pain will subside.  

It's interesting to hear about your son's hamstrings.  Mine are also incredibly tight -- I can't even touch my toes despite being so flexible, but I've never had any physical therapy done to loosen them up, or heard of any positive reason to do so, but I sure hope it is helping your son.  As for things like sports, let your son play!  I'm not sure where you stand on this, but don' let his EDS hold him back.  I was a three sport athlete in high school (before I was told to stop running) and had no ill effects.  I am currently an internationally competing equestrian, and I can tell you that horseback riding is great exercise for EDS kids.  Balance, muscle tone, and cardio all without the impact of running.  It is something I can do with few problems.

Tell your son to hang in there and use ice/hot packs when the going gets tough.  If you have any other coping questions let me know! 




 Here are some photos for you all.  I can't take my two favorite poses because that would require another person (me bending in half backwards touching my toes to my forehead and me popping my shoulder blades out like a spiny dinosaur), but maybe I can get them later today.

Me bending my fingers backward (no this does not hurt) http://i.imgur.com/51PjQ.jpg

My fingers bending by themselves (without me pushing them back).  I can hold a tennis ball this way!  http://i.imgur.com/y5sc6.jpg

How I type.  Palms stay flat on the laptop, and only my fingers move: http://i.imgur.com/RLVPL.jpg

 From your description it sounds like she may, though I have no business diagnosing people.  Does she have chronic pain?  Aches in her joints and muscles?  It is possible to have hypermobility without the pain -- my mom has it as well (it is genetic) but can run and do things I can't do.  My 63-year old mom can outrun me!  

Of course, if she does gymnastics, yoga, pilates, or other "stretching" forms of exercise, it could simply be from that.  You can "become" a bit hypermobile through certain exercises. 




 Well, if you're referring to sexual positions (which I'm guessing you are), it IS rather beneficial.  You can basically put any part of my body anywhere you like.  

On a more serious note though, there can be complications with pregnancy, and this condition is genetic, so he and I both have some concerns about having kids, if we ever choose to.  I can't say I would want my future children to go what I've been through.    




 Huzzah!  Don't let the haters get you down, man. 




 Haha!  Now that I'm sitting here at my desk trying it out, I would say that yes, it is rather easy. 




 I like you too kaizerfloyd!   




 I have always been a bendy individual, but chronic pain in high school
sent me to the rheumatologist to figure out what was going on with my
body. Turns out I have hypermobility syndrome, sometimes called benign joint hypermobility syndrome (BJHS) and, more recently, believed to be the same as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_joint_hypermobility_syndrome#Hypermobility_syndrome.

I also have visual snow (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_snow)
but I'm not sure if there is any correlation between the two, since
little research on visual snow has been done.

I sprain all the time, I type like a freak (according to my
boyfriend), I sleep in positions that look like I've been in a
horrible accident, and I can't run (my legs can't handle it), but I do
live an active and joyful life despite my rebellious body! AMA!

Edit: pictures have been taken and are linked below! 




 Well, he has a son...so too late!  Also, from what I have seen/heard, he is a FANTASTIC father.

 *hugs fellow Artie-loving Redditor* 




 Whoever made this, bless you for including Artie - The Strongest Man in the World. 




 Mine looks almost identical too, but probably larger from what I can see in the photo.  He is springer spaniel/golden retriever.  http://imgur.com/F8o6g  Maybe the postman's dog was a golden?   




 When I was a little kid I thought that the Colonel Sanders logo was a chicken nugget with a face and tie.  




 I second what amaltheas2 has said.  As another horse owner/rider/competitor of many years, stick to riding lessons, and lease a horse before you buy.  If you are going to eventually buy a horse for your children, make sure you have a professional trainer you know and trust try out the horse for you, and also have your kids try out the horse to make sure it is suitable for them and their riding abilities.  Also, even if your kids are small DO NOT buy them a pony.  Ponies are smart, quick, and sometimes rather mean.  Even though they seem more intimidating because they are larger, get an older horse for your children instead.  It may be a longer way to fall off, but they will most likely fall off much less often.  Be safe and good luck! 









 I've always thought royal blue looked great on lighter, redder bays, but I'm not sure what colors they have.  I'm sure she'll look great in any color! 




 1: Awesome coloring job.

2: You are some serious eye candy (assuming you're the guy in the photo). 
























 Glad you are enjoying it everyone!  I ride again tomorrow night (Saturday) at the very end of the evening session.  I'm number 422, see if you can spot me! 




 Too cute!  And what a great mare -- you two can do anything together! 




 You can watch the show as much as you like for free!  They have live feeds from all three show rings (which work simultaneously), but most of the action goes on in the Coliseum.  I'll be showing my horse tonight in the Hunter Pleasure Amateur World Championship.  Evening session begins tonight at 7pm central time.  Have fun watching! 









 Go Morgans!  Proud to see my breed do so well! 




 They are an incredibly beautiful family!  Men so sexy, kids so cute!!!! 




 They are an incredibly beautiful family!  Men so sexy, kids so cute!!!! 




 AWWWW!!!!!  What breed?  You guys are the cutest! 




 I had a baby squirrel once as well, and then he was rehabbed and released into the wild.  His name was Earl. :) 




 The day I met him, I deleted my account.  True story. 




 My experience on OkCupid ended with me finding my boyfriend.  Coming up on 2 years together this winter.  We are a happy family (family = the two of us and the dog)! 




 He actually has TWO thermals, because last Halloween I *almost* got him to go as Dexter.  He looks incredibly sexy in them.  I wish I had pictures of THAT to share with you! 




 Here you go:  http://i.imgur.com/qdnoF.jpg (with our dog Apollo) and also http://i.imgur.com/JMLF4.jpg.  Perhaps not the best pictures of him, but the ones that are the most "Dexter-y".  :)  See what you think.  He claims there is no resemblance! 




 My boyfriend looks like Dexter, but he won't believe me.  Either way, they are both hella sexy.   














 I hope it is delicious!  On a side note, you have the best username ever. 




 I've learned to love mine my naming all of them.  The best one is Weeb, and his dog Ghosty. 




 I thought it was normal too until about 10 years ago when my friends gently explained that I was a freak. 




 Oh man, his beard looks nuzzleable. 




 Tall, sexy, great voice, glasses...what more could a woman want? 




 So hot.  So hilarious.  Dibs. 




 YES!  This is the secret game I play on the bus each morning on the way to class. 




 I want to rip all seven of those shirts off of him! 




 I want to rip all seven of those shirts off of him! 




 AH YES!  I have the biggest ladyboner for him.  And this picture is my favorite.  It's gotten to the point that just seeing radishes like these gives me a ladyboner!  And when he wears a plaid shirt and rolls up the sleeves, and you get to see those forearms...*swoon*

I've met him a couple times, and not only is he a total hottie, he is also a humble sweetheart.  A very nice guy!   




 Holy ladyboner!!!   




 He has such a great beard.  Good beard is key. 




 Major swoon, and such magnificent forearms!!! 




 I call second dibs. 




 That would be awesome!  They need little BSG uniforms. 




 Oh this happens all the time!  The Crazy Color Breeders as I call them.  I had to ride some National Show Horses back in the day that were all bred to be pinto, and most of them looked like they had been put together by a committee, and few of them had a brain.

There are, of course, some really excellent uniquely colored horses out there!  I just like a good horse, no matter what color it happens to be. 




 BAHAHAHA!  Man, I want a ninja to defend my uterus.  




 I think he's sharing something painful that is happening to him, and is also proud of his grandfather for the fight he put up.

I'm going to stop replying to you now, and you'll probably see it as a victory for yourself, but really it's me having better things to do than argue with you. 




 I don't think that is what the OP is doing here.   




 I don't like you. 




 It's nice, he's a culturally aware sociopath.   









 Ahhh so this happens after the egg has already cooked.  I must try this!
 




 I, too, live in Minnesota.  Just wait until winter.  Then the bitching will commence. 




 I must understand how this works.  Putting the chopstick there to create the shape I understand, but the shell is still on.  How does it get though the egg's mighty armor? 




 That.  Is.  Terrifying. 




 Well the horse isn't fat, she's pregnant.  She'll be fine. :) 




 I love that it's wearing an oven mitt. 




 I had the ever-dreaded sunburn from snow, and I was wearing sunglasses with an earflap hat.  I *wish* I had pictures. 




 Whatever he is, he's sexy. 




 Upvote for ponies. 




 THIS!  I look at my boyfriend's can of abpa all the time and think, "what the hell is abpa?" 




 I'm a big fan of Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds.  Added bonus: their catalogs are beautiful!  




 Adorable!  For some reason I think she looks like the dog Martha from the TV show "Martha Speaks".  I think it's the expression. 




 I too own an Apollo, but his full name is Mr. Apollo Happypants Creed. 




 upvote for ears 




 Also with a name engineered for cuteness! 




 I've always liked the name Finn for a dog.  He looks like a Finn. 




 Starbuck!  She is super cute!  Mine is Apollo, also after BSG!  (http://i.imgur.com/8OuAw.jpg) 




 Ah yes, my dog is all about the bathtub.  He will also hop into the shower with you to get water if you don't close the bathroom door. 
























 There's a Breyer horse in it's box in there!  I see it!  I collect those man.  I wonder which one it is? 




 upvotes for forearm love! 




 I love draft mules!  How is Sunny to ride?  I've thought about getting a mule as a for fun/trail mount someday. 




 Me too!  I lust after him whenever I watch Party Down. 




 Ohhhhhhh my you are a lucky lady!  If you ever get tired of him, I call dibs!  :) 









 SO cute.  What a tolerant little guy!  My horse would give me a withering look to end all withering looks if I did that to him. 




 Oh he is lovely, and so talented.  I love that this picture is so high res that I can zoom in and examine his sexy stubble! 









 I think Mythbusters should try to reenact this one... 




 The gloves I have are amazing, and are currently on sale for $15!  They are engineered for people with arthritis (they support your joints and reduce hand fatigue), but myself and many of my friends use them because they really DO reduce hand fatigue while riding and they are an all around great glove.  Plus, they are machine washable!  Nice enough that I wear mine in the show ring.  http://www.bionicgloves.com/shop/?cat=31 id=43 




 Your taco is indeed beefy!  I approve.  Too bad it would be weird to share...or clone him.   




 Since it sounds like the saddle will be used on lots of different horses, you may want to wait on buying saddle and instead get some other accessories for her.  The first thing I got when I was a kid were a set of my own stirrups (so I didn't always have to adjust when I rode), and then when I got my first horse I got a saddle.  Boots, riding pants, a new helmet, a grooming kit, etc. may be better ideas for now. 




 Ohhhhh my.  To have the money to build something like that!  And those Friesians!   









 Your horse has such great ears!  Cute and tippy. 




 I wish I had seen this thread earlier!  Here are mine:

Tudor Oak's The Real Deal aka "Rillo" http://i.imgur.com/TVTI0.jpg
and his mom, Baby Ruth MHF aka "Baby" http://i.imgur.com/jFVcm.jpg 




 Please don't shut this down!  I haven't even noticed the trolls you are talking about.  Let one of us (perhaps me) mod it.  Like Nymera says, there are trolls everywhere, and in every subreddit.   




 My trainer always likes to say that your toes should be behind the girth, no matter what gait you are performing, though the ear/hip/heel rule is a bit different for Saddleseat, since it is acceptable to have your lower leg farther forward.  This is especially true when riding a Saddlebred at the slowgait or rack, since it is often helpful to push your feet forward a bit (though it depends on the horse). 

Some of the best info I can give you are photos.  Here are pictures of this year's Senior Saddleseat Equitation World Champion.  The first picture is her "down" in her post, the rest are her "up" in her post.  Now, this is an equitation rider, so she is being judged solely on her position and control of the horse.  When I ride, my equitation isn't bad, but my legs aren't so far under me.  Sorry for the long urls.

Down in my post (my heels could be more down) http://i.imgur.com/P3nbi.jpg

Up in my post http://i.imgur.com/3p2Gu.jpg (again, more weight should be in my heels)

Hope this helps a bit!  Above all, don't ride like this!!!  http://www.uphaonline.com/images/2010%20awards/lamborghini-in-black.jpg (phenomenal horse, but terrible leg position!)
 




 I can't help you out with a date, but I would like to commend you for also using the word "pineapple" in your username! 




 I will always, ALWAYS upvote this, mostly because my boyfriend is a spitting image.  Grrrrowwwlllllllll. 




 Can you post a picture of his entire body so we can see his socks?  It would give him a better shot at being ID'd.  I have people I can send his photo and info to, but I know they'll want to see all his markings. 




 I haven't encountered another mix like this in person, but some people are beginning to intentionally breed them.  They call them "Spangold Retrievers" (which is an *incredibly* stupid name), but you can get one on the internet!  http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/s/spangoldretriever.htm 




 Best ever!  Whenever I got to Europe, I stock up :) 




 I am by no means a "professional", but I have a nice camera, and have done things like equine photography and senior photos for people.  I think I could make it work. 




 Bart is darling!  And yes, where the heck to you ride?  Magical Acres???  It's beautiful!

Also, non-jumper person question: What exactly are the ear nets used for?  I see them on jumpers all the time, but we don't use them in my discipline.   




 oh yeah, rub that dirt right in to all the WHITE spots.  :) 




 Apollo is a Springer Spaniel/Golden Retriever cross.  We got him from the pound when he was a pup. 




 She is so cute!  I'm guessing she doesn't have the spaniel in her though, because her ears are way smaller and without curly hair.  I think black lab/golden is spot on.  Mutts are the best! 




 This is my dog!  He is from the pound also, and is a springer spaniel/golden retriever cross.  How big is your dog?  Apollo here is about 65 lbs. 














 Is this the one where we have to be from Canada?  I'll gladly participate, but I am in the U.S. 




 I don't know who this is, but I want one. 




 Wow, beautiful!  And I love your coat. :) 




 I came here because I KNEW he would be on the frontpage.  A ladyboner for sure! 




 This should get xposted on r/ladyboners.  We love a good beard over there. 




 This should get xposted on r/ladyboners.  Hellooooooooooooo OP. 




 This is a cute picture, but does not accurately convey his hotness.  Let's try this one!  http://28.media.tumblr.com/6imY2Ibivosygedu4nGXPYRxo1_500.jpg

Also this one is more recent: http://www.baltimoresun.com/media/photo/2011-01/58991602.jpg 









 Well whoever told you to post this here was correct!  Hot hotness!  And I concur with Januarys_Own -- may we see more? 




 He is super sexy, and when he rolls up his sleeves and kneads fondant...oooooooooo...

Have you seen the video of him playing guitar and singing?  Extra hot. 









 I just meant that I don't know who this is, or who the other out of focus people are.  I'm not a pop-culture queen, so this could totally be a famous person and I would have no idea.  Regardless, he's very easy on the eyes. :) 




 I don't really know what I'm looking at, but I like it! 




 Oh my. 




 ...wanna rip that moustache right off him.  Rawr. 




 Sweet jeebus, did you see this photo?  http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SPKGl9Ae9N0/TkKkb3sZf6I/AAAAAAAAAxo/dbFhc8uBHxw/s1600/mateus+verdelho4.jpg 




 Thanks!  And yes, that is indeed me in the saddle.  :) 




 Oh my.  Yes! 




 This is a hunter pleasure class (the way Morgans do it).  This particular division was the Ladies Amateur Hunter Pleasure World Championship.  And yes, here are some pictures of him "au natural".  He loves to play in the snow. :)  1) http://i.imgur.com/bbXAq.jpg  2) http://i.imgur.com/zQ7nj.jpg  3) http://i.imgur.com/V5TBh.png

He goes home today and will begin the first day of his winter vacation tomorrow.  No shoes, no haircuts, and lots of time outside to run and play and roll in everything!  He loves to go to shows and loves to work, but I think he's ready for a break!!!   




 Muppet dog! 




 As the owner of a different dog named Apollo, I approve!  He looks snuggly! 




 Why does Iceland have to be so far away from where I live? 









 My GOD.  You are beautiful!  And wearing plaid!  And I'll be you have nice forearms too.  That's the test_subject773 trifecta right there. 
























 Love for the rest of him too!  That stubble...ooooh. 




 Maybe he feels FAB-uloussssssss!!!!!!  My horse is kind of metro -- he can totally rock a pink saddle pad, and he likes having his hair done. 




 Alright, some ideas (some of which are already names of other horses that exist in other breeds, but it shouldn't matter).  Though I do like Legolas!

Stand and Deliver,
Gestalt (yes, I'm a design nerd),
Instant Karma,
Out of Bounds,
Night Out,
No Inhibitions,
Bada Bing,
Outspoken,
Fight Song,
Own the Night,
Chill Factor,
Floored,
Unapologetic,
Once Again,
By Invitation Only,
Alliteration,
To the Nines,
Enthusiastic,
Slow Burn,
Art in Motion,
Shoot the Moon,
Thrill a Minute,
High Definition,
Bold Moves,
Artful Move.

As you can see, I have SO many ideas.  If you want me to run with a theme, word, idea, etc, let me know!
 




 OHHHHHH He's a Saddlebred!  No wonder I love him so much, I've been riding Saddlebreds for years.  Now that I look at him again, I can see it in his face.  Well, I'll think of some names!

And yes, it does look like he would have flunked out of "Saddlebred School" due to his movement, but what so many people don't realize is that Saddlebreds make great dressage, endurance, eventing, jumping, trail, EVERYTHING horses.  They may be the peacocks of the show ring, but they should be recognized as the peacocks of MANY show rings!  And he certainly won't have trouble flexing and putting his head in a nice spot for dressage.  I'm glad he found a home with you, he's going to have so much fun learning dressage! 




 What are the names of his sire/dam?  Sometimes that's a good way to name.  And what breed?  What do you intend to do with him?  Dressage?  This information must be known to achieve a truly kickass name. :)

Also, HE IS GORGEOUS!!!  He is soooooo floaty and beautiful!   




 I knew I loved tapirs, but now I know why. 









 YES.  Just...yesssssssssssssssssss.
 




 Thanks for the well wishes.  She's actually doing really well, and I rode her a bit today!   




 You are both my heroes. 




 YOU get an upvote because you love forearms and, according to your username, HORSES!  I also love both these things.  I have two horses, I also have two forearms.  This cannot be coincidental. 




 We use Markell Insurance for both our horses.  Check it out at http://www.markelinsurance.com/Products/Farm/Pages/PrivateHorseOwnerLiability.aspx

I couldn't tell you off the top of my head what we pay for the insurance, but I know it varies depending on how much coverage you need, i.e. what your horse is "worth".  That depends on show record, age, etc.   They have good medical coverage, but now my mare has issues being covered on ANY equine insurance because of laminitis issues.  




 Great picture!  I'm there right now.  Last day in Venice today after living here for 6 weeks.  Sad day. :( 









 You are very, very unalone!  I crush on him all the time when I watch The IT Crowd. 









 I agree, Toalmaster is far more lady-bonerific than Channing Tatum. 




 You, rulefollower, are not only apparently an upstanding citizen, but also a very attractive man!  This should make it over to r/ladyboners. 




 I show Morgans, so I switch between huntseat (flat) and saddleseat, but I also do quite a bit of driving!   




 Oh my, yes.  There are so many things right with this picture. 




 No, you don't get to go in there, you're just outside the pens.  However, this is still close enough that I have been licked by a wolf and bit in the butt by and ostrich.  




 I would kill to see what you will do with mine.  I hope you find it in all these comments.   




 Check out http://www.volunteermatch.org/. You can search by your location and interests.  It's a pretty great site, and I've found some good things through their search.  Also, volunteering at Como Park is pretty fun -- I was on the grounds crew for a while, and planted and weeded by all the animal exhibits.  The giraffes totally loved me. :) 














 It's not in Hyde Park, but when I was in London I went riding at Wimbledon Village Stables.  My mom and I both rode and had a great experience.  They are proximate to a huge and beautiful park, with lots of wooded paths for hacking.  We got to canter through the forest on some nicely trained horses.  Also, it wasn't anywhere near $150.  We had a guide, and it was just the three of us (the guide, my mom, and I).  So we rode very much for our experience level.  Check them out!  If you can't find anything for Hyde Park, try them instead.  They are a short (20 min) train ride from London.  http://www.wvstables.com/ 




 I remember always feeling bad for the kids with Rose Art crayons.  I was a very aware kindergartner.   




 I have Ariat Terrians http://www.ariat.com/English/Women/Footwear/EnduranceBoots/Terrain.html?color=SUNSHINE  They are incredibly comfortable, and have had the pair I'm currently using for 6+ years.  I wear them outside of the barn quite a bit too. :)  They are casual looking, so I suppose that has to be ok for you and your needs, but myself and my trainers all have these boots and love them. 




 Nice to know there's more than one of us on Reddit. :D  Though I'm primarily a Morgan rider, but dabble in Saddlebreds and Hackneys. 




 Awww yeah, and I don't even like cats!  Change that cat to a puppy and I'll need to change my undies. 




 I also demand more photos!  What a gorgeous horse! 




 Oh same.  We should have a St. Olaf subreddit for funsies.  Though I doubt it would be very active. 




 This scene was filmed at my college.  I had class in that lecture hall! 




 I see your pony and I raise you me (5'3") on a SMALLER pony!

http://i.imgur.com/SoLVO.jpg

 




 I would snuggle the crap out of him.  And then make out with him copiously.  :) 




 I ride west of Schamburg in Marengo at Merriehill Farm.  It's about 45 minutes from you, and SO worth it!  They breed and train wonderful Morgan horses!  They do all seats there, and have a beautiful facility.  Lessons are $30, and I think you can do a package deal.  Also, they are wonderful people, and the trainer, Jess is the best!  They have an excellent string of lesson horses for all abilities. Give them a call!  http://merriehillfarm.com/ (watch the video!) 




 I want one.  Preferably in that tree. 




 I want a dapple grey Morgan park horse.  Of course, since there are under 500 registered grey Morgans, and most of those come from more western bloodlines, this may be impossible.  But hey, a girl can dream!  So...like this, but grey... :)  http://morganhorseauction.com/images//2009/CenterpieceREF.jpg 




 I want to snuggle him!!! 




 There is a movie with Robert Urich from the 90's called A Horse for Danny.  You can buy it crazy cheap on Amazon.  http://www.amazon.com/Horse-Danny-Leelee-Sobieski/dp/B000A1IL8M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1330539605 sr=8-1  It is my favorite horse movie!  As a child, I was obsessed -- I think I wore out the copy they had at the video store, and my mom finally got me my own VHS of it. 

As far as books, Walter Farley's "Man O' War" is great, even as I grow older, and there is a biography of Cigar called "Cigar: America's Horse" that is very well done.   




 I don't, but I'd love to try!  Also, yay for ASBs!
 




 She is darling! 




 Have you videoed her yet?  I've found that when I see a horse for sale, even if there is a picture of them in motion, I have to see a video to really see how the horse moves.  So I would say a) a video of her doing her thing (jumping, trotting, etc) and then a video.  If it costs too much to list with a video on Dreamhorse, put the video on YouTube and link to it in her listing.   




 Want.  To.  Exist... 




 What a fabulous horse!  What is he? 




 Arab was my second guess!  That or Morab.  The stubborn ones are always lovable. :)  Do you still ride Arabs? 




 Are you riding a Morgan? Looks Morgan-y to me.  SUPER CUTE!!!! 




 Her sister in law has mad skills! 









 Awesome man!  As someone who has had 15 teeth pulled out of their mouth to make things right, I know how awesome your victory feels! 




 Eeeeee!  I give him an 11 out of 10! 




 See, when I was a kid I thought he was a chicken nugget with a face and a tie, I didn't know he was supposed to be a wrinkly old guy.  When I found out he was a real person it blew my mind. 




 She is cute, but also beeeeeyooootiful!  Welsh pony? 




 You could certainly drive in your arena, and learning to drive is part of the fun.  I'm sure someone could show you the ropes! 




 Hot man, cute dog!  And I love your bedsheets!  They are so pretty. 




 If you can't ride, could you drive?  I'm not sure if either of your horses know how to drive, and I wouldn't suggest trying to train them to do it yourself, but if a knowledgeable person can start them in harness locally, I'd bet they'd take to it quickly.  Driving can really help with your riding too, since you have to communicate through your hands and voice, and it gives you a great "feel" for a horse's mouth. 
























 This would be a legitimately awesome remake. 




 Ahhhh my face hurts! 




 Upvote not only for a good idea, but for a horticultural username! 




 Ooo!  Details please!   I dream of such a meeting. 




 Beautiful color!  What do you guys do together? 




 I need to photoshop a fake book cover for this title. My horse trainer is obsessed with those books too, so she would die laughing!
 




 I must tell her this!  She looks no where near her age, and I think it's awesome.  I hope I have those genes! 




 Oh dear God. 




 Awwwww...that is so cute!  I'll have to see if my horse likes strawberries, I never thought to give him those.  He's a carrot man all the way. 




 Oof, I will not.  He's a gelding, so he'd probably get really sexually frustrated. 




 She will love you for saying that. :) 




 Reddit ALL THE PONIES!   




 Now I have to look that up.  I've never heard it.  Maybe it'll be my horse's new jam.  Right now he's really into LMFAO's "Party Rock Anthem" (seriously, he boogies to it). 




 Of course!  I'm sure they love you too, especially my horse -- he loves EVERYONE.   




 Cute!  Horses are much more "tuned in" to what is going on than people think.   




 I see a Halloween costume in his future... 




 I try to spend a lot of time with him in his stall at horse shows so he doesn't get bored.  My mom and I were hanging out in there and talking about when our friends were riding later in the day, so she pulled the horse show schedule out of her purse and started to look over it.  He came over and stuck his face right in it and was like, "what is that!?!?!?!".  She laughed and she started "showing" him which competitions our friends were in and when they would happen.  Usually he is very busy and squirms all over, but he just stood there staring and listening and wanted her to talk more.  Really, he loves attention, so he likes lots of things: stories, toys, going for walks, neck scratches, etc.  He just likes to be with people. :) 









 That face...I know it all too well. 




 Take my upvote!  For I, too, have a dog named Apollo.  http://i.imgur.com/1E77X.jpg 




 Puppy = pony.  Socks = legwraps.  But really though, AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW! 









 How is this not on the front page?  This is the epitome of AWWWWWW. 




 Upvotes for rats!   




 OH the ears!  The ears are too cute! 




 I see countless ads advertising a horse that is a "3 year old philly".  Like the cream cheese? 









 He is perfect!  And I love his facial hair. :)
 




 Dear God, she's only 9 and she's already cooler than I will ever be. 




 I still have my old iBook G4, which I would loan you happily, but it's 8 or 9 years old, and not exactly the sleek wonder that my MacBook Pro is.  It does, however, show how well these computers age.  I only had to get a new computer because the G4 couldn't handle some of the software I needed for grad school.   




 Mr. Tastee was my favorite, and am still, to this day, fascinated by the mystery man in the swirly head.  Even my username is inspired by him!  Was the guy that played Tastee also in other roles on the show?  Or did he only play that one character?  I've always wondered what he looked like, but I'm not sure if seeing the face of Tastee would make my childhood or ruin it.  

Also, do you know why season three of Pete and Pete never got released on DVD?  Where seasons 1 and 2 not selling as well as they had hoped?  Seems like there are a lot of Redditors...errr...people who would rush out to buy season 3.

Edit:  Just found [this](http://www.redbubble.com/people/meganlara/works/8098367-mr-tastees-blue-tornado-bars) online.  Commence purchasing. 




 Whoever made this suggestion was CORRECT!  Nice foreguns. :) 




 He really is.  It's too bad, because that subreddit has more followers, and is updated more often.  I still check it out, but just can't post.  Does anyone know if there's something you can do about mods like that?  Is there any sort of place where you can say, "this mod is out of control?"  I feel like so many people are treated unfairly by him.  If you look at his comment history it can be downright cruel.  I'd love to report his actions, but don't know who to contact. 




 Wishing a speedy recovery to your boy!  My horse has a talent for banging himself up doing normal things (lunging, trying to take his blanket off, being turned out), so I know the fear when you get that call. 




 AH HAHAHAHA!  This is hilarious.  Now I'm mad at myself for not taking a picture like this.  So many missed opportunities.

Yeah, you guys are right about the mod on r/horses.  I got banned because I asked him to rephrase one of the subreddit's rules (it was poorly worded and people would get confused and inadvertantly violate it).  Let's make it a better party over here on r/Equestrian! 




 Is it one by Adam Turman?  He has this one: http://adamturman.blogspot.com/2008/04/new-stuff-march-08.html 




 She is so beautiful!  That's pretty unusual to have blue eyes surrounded by dark skin/hair, isn't it?   




 You are very attractive (even though you have the toots). 




 And people say dogs can't smile. :)  Too cute!!! 




 Please fix the rule then about for sale items.  It currently reads: "All items, services for sale and blog articles should be posted in the proper reddit post linked to from the right sidebar."  There is no "for sale" category on the sidebar.  In fact, there are not categories at all on the sidebar.  Just make the rule "no items/horses for sale". 




 Hehe...Dennis Hopper. 









 Are you familiar with the phenomenon of "visual snow"?  If so, do you think this is something that will be researched and potentially cured, or since it is benign, do you think I'll just have to live with it forever?  I've had it all my life, and it makes my night vision poor to the point that I sometimes wonder if I should have a restricted driver's license.    




 I work with Morgans.  As for tapping the back legs, we don't ask them to move the back legs, simply move the front ones and stretch out their back legs.  If you mare moves her front legs forward, and the centers the weight of her body on her front legs, her back legs will stretch out.  I don't think Morgans park out differently than TWHs, do they?  Here is a parked out Morgan:http://randstables.com/files/2012/02/BoogieNE.jpg

You can see that he is putting most of his weight on his front legs. 




 The way my trainers have done it in the past is through patience and repetition.  First you have to teach her how to do it in hand, and then you can move up to doing it under saddle (for the line-up).  Halter your mare and take her out.  You could even do it in cross ties if you want, to make your life easier.  Take a whip, or even the handle of a broom, and gently tap on the back of one of her front legs, saying "down".  "Down" will be your command for parking out.  Then when she moves her foot, lots of praise!!!  Now do the other one, saying "down".  More praise!!!!!!!  Carrots!!!!!  Sometimes horses have problems lining their feet up straight when they are learning to park out.  I've seen my trainers grab the top of the horse's withers and rock them back and forth, to unbalance the horse just a bit and get them to square up their feet.  

Once she does it on the ground with you saying "down", and maybe just tapping a tiny bit or not at all, try it under saddle.  Find a long whip and pretend like you are in the lineup at a show.  Tell her "down", and lean over to tap her legs with the whip.  She'll probably put two and two together after a few tries.  In a show, you won't want to tap her legs with the whip, but you can tap her on the shoulder and tell her "down", and that is a refinement of the command.  Most of our horses park out when they are told "down", and many of them park out automatically when they come into the middle of the ring to stand.  

I hope this makes sense and I hope it helps!  It should be a fun exercise for you and your mare -- you get to learn together!  Good luck, and let me know if you have any more questions.
 




 Classes at breed shows get big and it's often important to stand out.  The judge may love your horse, but if your horse doesn't have distinctive markings you may get lots in a sea of navy hunt coats!  I show my Morgan in the Hunter Pleasure division, and have one light green coat and one tan/gold coat.  I wear them with dark shirts, and wear the tan coat with dark brown breeches.  I also wear a conservative belt, and sparkly stock pins and number pins.  Some bling is totally ok!  It would look crazy in the H/J circuit, but at a breed show it's very typical.  For reference, here are a few photos to give you an idea:

Green coat on my mare: http://i.imgur.com/DwQf9.jpg

Hope this helps, and may you have blue ribbon rides!


 




 What is he crossed with?  He looks like a purebred Morgan to me! 




 This needs to go on my wall!
 




 I'm here for you in this difficult time. 




 I love plants, so I've volunteered at the Como Conservatory in St. Paul, and I now work at Noerenberg Gardens.  While I have a paid position, many people there are volunteers.  

Also, go to volunteermatch.org.  You can search for volunteer positions by interest and location.  It's pretty awesome. 




 My boyfriend and I have lived in Minnetonka for a few years and love it.  You're right, there ARE lots of great trails and parks here.  We take out dog all sorts of places and go hiking and swimming.  I'll have to look up some details for you as far as things to do, but there is no shortage!  PM me if you like.  Maybe we can meet up sometime. 




 Double the sodium! 




 Haha, the saddle *does* have some shape to it.  It's not like my saddleseat saddle!  Here is a picture of a Wotan, though I feel like mine may be a bit more shallow.  It's a great saddle if you're looking for an all-purpose close contact type.  http://www.countrytack.com/used_saddles/wotan_left.JPG 




 I personally have a Stubben Wotan I bought off ebay.  It was only $350, and in amazing condition.  Not sure what you like as far as cushion/support, but I love the Wotan because there is no padding on the seat or knee roll areas, and the knee roll is very small.  Also, the saddle is fairly flat, which fits my horse well and is what I like to ride in, but won't work if your horse has high withers.  

Maybe you like a squishy saddle...if you do, the Wotan is NOT for you, but I do love mine!   :)  Also, I use it for riding at home and showing, and it is a great all around saddle.   




 HECK YES!  My friend and I were watching this one day now that we are older, and agree that he is dreamy (especially in the 3rd movie) even though is a cartoon dog.   




 I had that one!  Now I want to know where it is.  Personally, I still use my Power Rangers insulated lunch box at work (I'm 26).  Also, your username is wonderful and I envy it.
