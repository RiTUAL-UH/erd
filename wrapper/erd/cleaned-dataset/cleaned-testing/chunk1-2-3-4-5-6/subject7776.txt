 During school I am perfectly fine, I laugh (Well... giggle), smile, and am generally a positive person. I get all my work done in class, I never have homework, I help out people when asked. I try my best to just help. But when I get home I am instantly having suicidal thoughts, I fight with my girlfriend, and I just overall hate everything.

I feel like I'm just a horrible person, I believe I have let my father down. He wanted a smart child who likes what he is into, But I'm not smart in my eyes, and I don't like sports and NASCAR and all of that stuff, I tried to play sports to please him but after I cracked my head I said "I don't want to play sports again" and I haven't. I like games, and girls...
I've never heard my parents say "I love you." I know its hard to believe but I just haven't. They don't go out on dates, or kiss or anything. I feel like its my fault.
People think, "Oh Travis, You have it was easy you get what you want and can do whatever."
But getting what I want isn't fine. My parents do not have a college savings account for me, nor my brother. My brother (who is smart) got a little bit of a scholarship and it makes it easy for him to go. I, however will not get a scholarship, I don't get 100% on tests and I don't do the best work.
So, I don't know what I'll do for college. I don't want my family to take out another loan. I would like my parents to just go out on dates, and act like a married couple.
I take medicine but the dosage seems to be too small, if I take 2 I'm happy all day and everything is fine.
I noticed myself getting depressed after a break-up, I tried so hard to make everything up and talk to her, I wrote a 6 page letter to her, and she just ignored it. Awhile later I had tried to search our home for a pistol we keep for safety. I searched often when no one was home and could never find it, and I'd usually end up sitting on the bed and crying.
On my birthday, sadly, I had tried to OD. My birthday wasn't good.

I don't want to die, and I don't want to have these thoughts, but they won't leave me alone. I just want to have my parents be a couple, I want my my father to say hes proud of me, And I want to be happy.

Help? 




 Ah, thank you. And one last thing, do you know how much a Gold Botkiller Rocket Launcher is? 




 Thank you, so its 20keys or a bud? 




 Thank you! 




 What are the prices on these?

 For the love of all the is tasty, I need a box or two. D: I miss them! 




 But... But... I want some too.. 




 I'm from Arizona, we don't have much but if you like any Arizonian snack and you happen to have some Oreo O's, I will gladly try my best to get the snack you want! 




 Can/Will/Does anyone have Oreo O's that they can ship to Arizona, USA?

I was way out in x 800 z -3000, in giant open fields and no town near, and I starved.. so please put animals in.

 I did Nazi that coming. 




 Too soon it seems. 




 Reason why I own Photoshop, is for things like this. 









 Thanks man :DDDDD 




 Hell yeah! :D 




 I put it on the pandas forehead, seeing as it wont go to the bottom right D: 




 Simple is special ;) 



















 Its fine, I understand that some people don't have the money. 




 I was wondering if any of you fine non-zombie people would actually donate to make a DayZ Lingor Island server in the US. I know a person who is whitelisted for a spot by the Lingor Hive. The only problem is we'd need money to host it. It'd be the only US server.

So, would anyone actually donate? 









 Ah, didn't see. Thanks :D 




 Except for sex. 









 I think this would be an amazing map to play DayZ on. 









 Honestly, its all good. You can keep trying to kill us, like the [NC] Clan. We're waiting. 




 Come at me bro. 




 Thank you for the hour long fire fight, deaths, and walk backs to the hill. I'm sorry a hacker had to come in a ruin the fun, hopefully we can fight again. But why would you have a camp up there in the hill? 




 Back when you spawned with a Mak, I shot a kid for lols. 




 I jumped... 




 Well, you gave me a good impression of the game which led me to buy it. :D 




 When you spawn in it'll say "Day x" (x being the day you've been alive) 




 This is what you get if you upload the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXIpPORrOKo 




 Uploading the video to YouTube at the moment. 




 lol its alpha 




 It was my first character ever made in Day Z, I spawned in Cherno (Though I didn't know that was its name). I had somehow found a friend, who was new as well and thought me how to use voice comm. We went around the building and found the hospital. I stumbled upon some Anti-Biotics and headed up the roof. I called for my friend to come look at the view and I made a dash for the ladder to see if he was coming, I ran off the roof and died instantly. 




 Oh, you fancy huh? 




 LOL 




 Yes. Yes. Yes. 




 wow, we're all in Chandler!! 




 A girl who likes me sent this to me, it always makes me smile.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0Ohl3MMq0o

Shes an amazing girl.

I mean really. 




 lol dont join unless you like to get raped by the AI 









 ART! D: 




 Russian server, very peaceful. 




 Welcome to the dark side, we've been expecting you. 














 I'm sorry, I don't have enough money to gift you it. Hopefully someone else will help you! I'm sorry. Have faith! The reddit community is full of good, friendly, and kind people! Hope to see you around DayZ sometime, hopefully soon ;)! 




 I know what I'm going to do now...

I keep reading this, its just so good.. 




 It'd be amazing getting a free copy, I could play with my friend who I literally do everything with, It'd just be nice to finally play a survival game with her and not play WoW all the time. Thank you for being super generous. Have a wonderful day. 




 I feel like I've killed you before... 




 Most of the day. 




 I did this today as well. TX20, It's very fun. 




 Contact me here or VIA steam. (test_subject7776) 




 Amazing shot. 




 fags. 




 LOL
Oh god, Olive, you, you're a funny man. 




 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVvxCdNv2vc 









 Ah, thank you both very much! :D 




 I was wondering what Add-on you need in order to have high quality skins and such? Any help would be appreciated! 




 Must have. 




 T'is a big bitch. 




 We're not mad. :P 




 So we were playing Day Z (7 of us) and we were in an open field checking a deer stand (of course it had nothing), we heard a shot and one of us died, we all proned down and DC'd. (Yes wussy move, wanna fight about it?) We reconnected to a new server and messed around in the field recollecting ourselves and healing our injured. The moment we were all ready to go we heard another shot and again, another friend got shot and died. We all hit the deck and now we're just waiting it all out.

Now I'm scared. 




 AHHHH THIS GUY! 




 You lead our group through the thick and thin, but in the end you just couldn't get to the ladders fast enough... 









 It's pretty sexy :3 




 I tried to get a real screenshot, but eh it takes pictures of my wallpaper instead. 




 lmao. 




 So I spawned in, found a house and a nice pair of Binoculars, I took them and then.. well these just randomly spawned. I can't pick them up, and they don't look like hatchets and crowbars... 









 How old are you? 




 priceless. 




 Oh god, this is amazing. 




 I'm on -7 time, but I'll play! 




 Anyone? 




 Steam. test_subject7776

 I came here before for them and no one gave, and I read that and came back again. lol :P 




 bold move, motherfucker. 




 Totally. 




 Hey now, what you think is gross i may find delicious. ;D 




 But its not like in Korea where you can't get certain things you want.
I'd rather help someone who needs/wants it.
Then someone who just wants to make a buck. 









 But I want to help someone. 




 I know that they only are sold in South Korea, but I would really love it if someone could send some my way. I live in Arizona and if you need my info message me.

I would be willing to send well, snacks, or anything you might need.
Ex: toiletries and the box of chips like [this](http://i.walmartimages.com/i/p/00/02/84/00/04/0002840004026_500X500.jpg)

So if you live in South Korea and can get them, please, do contact me!

EDIT: Still looking for some. :) 




 Ill do it for some Oreo O's.

Just tell me what you want and I'll try and find it! 




 Fuck you. 




 SOH

 I'll test whenever you want, I'll try and pm you when I get home. 




 I thought it said "hitler potato" so I kept waiting for the potato, and then I went back and say it said "photo", I am not a smart man. 




 I'm impressed. 




 Chandler, Arizona?

Sir, I will probably see you around or have seen you.

 So ass then, eh mate? 




 What a brave ass cat. 









 Annnnnd, My names Travis. Great. 




 I'm numb. It hurts. Oh god.  




 I shouldn't be laughing while fapping.. But her face.. 




 I feel like people don't understand it's an alpha.
I understand that's no excuse, but come on.
It's been out for maybe a week and you're all already bitching. 




 Touch 




 My name is Travis... Do I get a picture? 




 I want to, but then I'll feel like a pedo... 




 I'll say it.

Nice breasts. 




 I know I'm slow :( don't make fun of me. 




 Call me slow, but the Dota 2 "Sniper" has a line that says
"Thanks for standing still, Ganker"
just like the TF2 Sniper has a line that says
"Thanks for standing still, Wanker"

 Bought Legend. 




 Well lately my father has been getting paid less and less as the company he works for might lay off people. So in hopes of keeping his job now, he gets paid 1 week out of the month.
I've played the beta for CS:GO but as it came out, I have had no money to purchase it.
If anyone has a spare they can give me, that'd be amazing. Thank you. 




 Go home reddit, you're drunk. 




 I love to sleep. I'd come home from school and go straight into my bed. I like the warmth the blankets give off, sure it's not like a humans but its better than nothing. I also have cute purple panda stuffed animal who sleeps next to me.
But on Friday, the 28th, it didn't happen this way. I had done something I shouldn't have ever done. I sent a nude to a girl while I'm currently with someone else.
(Note: I did this before in my last relationship and, well you can guess the outcome.) I am the worst when it comes to keeping thing like this a secret. The guilt was eating me so I told my girlfriend what I had done. Needless to say, she was pissed. Now, I've only had depression or at least enough to where it stands out enough to be noticed and medicated, since my last relationship. I should have learned from my mistakes, but hey, I'm a teenager! Since I'm a teenager I jumped from point A to suicide. I'm the type of person who just wants to die all the time, and this whole mess just messed me up. I do already have my own disabilities like ADD and so on. So anyways any moment where my downstairs kitchen room was clear I would run an take some pills. In all I had taken 15 anti depressants, my last 2 ADD pills, and about 25ish+ painkillers. To my surprise I didn't die, I only got some pain in my leg, feeling like a baby was kicking my stomach, and my vision messed up for a while. I do wish I had died. I had found the love of my life, and well.. Messed up. Don't get me wrong my current girlfriend is amazing! But I have this connection with the girl I dated first (We will call her Kat). I just always want to be close to her and protect her. Kat actually wanted me back once but I decided to go out with my current girlfriend (We will call her Hannah). Because Hannah has liked me since gosh knows when, she always cares and asks me things, and also plays games with me. Kat has moved on, and of course, to one of my friends. I know I should get jealous ad or upset over these things, but I can't help it. I should be the one she sleeps with her head on. I do not make the best choices. I mean I usually pick the opposite of what's good for me, and I realize that I really wanted that other choice when it's too late. I've spent sometime searching the house where I live, for the gun we keep. But I can never find it and eventually end up sitting on the nearest bed and crying. I've even tried to over dose on my birthday, my birthday!
I just wish I could sleep for the rest of my life. 
If only my pills worked. They're just too weak to give me happiness.
I'll probably make my own post tomorrow, seeing as I can't get on the computer right the moment, as its 2:45am and I haven't slept in 30ish+ hours.
Good night guys, I hope you all have a lovely sleep, and wake up with a smile. 




 I wish I was a kid again. 




 I wish I was asleep. 




 ~ I don't think I could live being med free. If I still try to kill myself on the meds and with them, I don't want to know how I am off them. 




 Good luck, and have fun!
I like seeing things like this, it's cute and reminds me someone can find love.
Makes me all warm inside. 




 You better have fucking bought it. 




 OH GOD. THANK GOD IT'S COMMON TO HAVE INCEST WET DREAMS. 

I thought I was alone and that it was weird.
Whew, thank you OP for this.

I didn't mean to almost give you an aneurysm. 




 See, I was going to go with a 670, but I wanted the 4gb, and said hey.. 680 is the same price as a 670 4gb. And then 690 doubled fps of a 680.. and yeah.. :P

But thank you aphreshcarrot!

I was thinking of getting a new motherboard, put if it can support this card, I'd rather not spend.

So, do you think these two will work together?

(P.S. I have a Intel i5 2500k CPU @ 3.3 GHz)

Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks! 




 This is my current motherboard

Do I even need to upgrade the processor  motherboard, or will just getting the card work. 














 I'll take a shot. 




 Also, someone said I wouldn't play good, so thats why I asked here! :D 




 Ah, okay! Thank you very much mate :D! 




 Yeah, I just bought it and its not showing up anywhere too, I do have the receipt too!

I just want to make sure I have it... D: 














 I'll gladly trade my wrench for a rocket! 




 I am not in therapy and yeah they do. 
























 Touch sir, touch.

Still dicks in my opinion.
You don't have to play a supportive role, but you shouldn't say "it's undesirable" because saying that to someone who already is on the edge can just push them over. 




 They're dicks. 




 I love you.

 Oh my god, I need to play again, anyone know how to sign up? 




 It does suck indeed. 




 I'm glad I live in AZ so I can use 5% dark just looks good with grabber.

 Simply had a more updated version of core than I needed. Silly me!

Is that how this would work?

'Cause I have no idea where to put these and it's just so confusing. 




 Thank you! I will try it and get back. :) 




 How would I go about adding treecap and connected destruction to my FTB 1.5.2 beta server?

 That's perfectly okay. 




 That's disgusting! 




 I traded in all my stuff, and I'll be playing PC until PS4. 




 Gotta test shit somewhere. 




 Damn, so should I just get a PS3 and play them that way, before the PS4 comes out? 




 So, would PS4 have Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 on it, like in the store? Since I don't want to go buy another system just to play those 2 games.

I know you can't but the disk in, but I'm hoping they would have it available on the store.

Does anyone know? 




 Eh, at least I tried, right?
That's all anyone could of asked for! 




 I'M....TRY...ING.

IS IT... WORKING? 




 Dat ass indeed, brother. Dat ass indeed.. 




 You gon' die.

But in all seriousness, I personally wouldn't sleep and head to the doc, but I am not you, and I have no control over you.
Good luck. 




 It's insane. 




 Plus the Zombie knock down, needs to have a lower chance. 




 Now I don't want to go outside, thanks bro! 




 No one, literally, no one cares.

Also, why are you even stalking him? 




 I hate you so much.... 




 Ah Okay! 




 Thank you. 




 Did your boyfriend beat him to a bloody pulp?

EDIT: Thanks for the Down votes!:D 




 I'm reading that book right now, and that's what I was thinking. :P 




 You're a problem in the world.. 




 Hurts, so much. 




 It doesn't work. There is no point and I hate it. If anything, it makes everything worse.. 




 I helped a girl out of suicide, but when I've needed help, she just ignores me and says that I'm doing it for attention.
It's sad cause I was the only one to give a shit about here and then she turns around and kicks me away.

It's sad, really, really, sad. 




 I think you can get addicted, but that's just me. 




 Happy birthday.

I had my birthday on the 12th, I wish I wasn't here as well. I had gotten out of my second time in a mental/behavioral center for suicide. I even attempted on my birthday in 2012, I just don't care for life. It's boring, and they're making me do out patient shit, which is just large group therapy.

Happy birthday though. Good luck with your life. 




 Idk, torrent maybe? Not on a Computer so I can't say 100% 




 That explains your name. 




 Wow you tried hard.

Okay. Coolio. 




 But yaaaay, you got food!

I'll have u no I graaduatd top of mah navy sealz class.
I wud fuk u up 




 You're a cunt.

Ya I said it, wnna fire 'bout it. 




 Who cares about PETA 




 I clicked it bro, even after I read your comment.
I said to myself, it can't be that bad..

It fucking was. It really fucking was. 




 just whitelist the website? 




 Not that's "K" 




 Why do I go to this subreddit. 




 Dude. 




 Not today with this comment. 




 You lost all the upvotes you gained.
And then some. 




 Oh. 
























 I'm not good with words, but if you need anything, I'm here. I can get you a card and stuff.

Live for your children. You wouldn't want their Christmas gift to be a permanent scar on their minds. Love works as a gift, kisses and hugs, homemade things.

I'm not an adult so I don't have adult ideas on what to do, but If you need money to get them something small I'm totally game for sharing some of my money.

I'm sorry this year wasn't the best for you. 




 Ah okay.

Drop the .jar in the mods folder
If you have a custom config put in config folder

Start server and type /veinminer mode sneak

Tadaa 




 We're good, I figured it out. But it was for my dedicated server.
Thanks though! 




 How would I add Veinminer to a server?
I've opened the FTP and put the .jar in the mods folder and the config in the config folder but it is not working. Any ideas? 




 Just, wow. Beautiful. I'm in absolute awe. 




 Not for awhile I think. It did just come out and it is an early access game. 









 I like more HP and everything, but that would just be a pain in the ass.

Still, looks very clean. 




 Hahahaha, and I hope man, I can't wait until 2015 so I can go to training and start fresh. 




 Marines, try and be a combat engineer. 




 Damn, I'm stupid haha, I read the first sentence wrong.
I know it's not all fun, there are long hours, bad pay, conditions can be shit. I understand its not all GUNS, 'MERICA, 'SPLOSIONS, or fun.
Drill instructors will yell/scream at you for every little thing you do wrong and how you talk.
Which I think is a good thing, I need a new experience, and learn how to get over things, or I'm never going to.
I just feel like it'd be nice to fight for the person next to you instead of yourself, for once.

Maybe I'm thinking about it wrong, or what not, anyways, sorry if my post didn't make any sense last night. That is my bad! :P 




 I hope! And awesome, that's good to know just in case!
Thanks man! 




 Luckily you didn't get prescribed anything (I think), haha, but to me it shouldn't matter if I can take the meds after, cause one thing that makes me feel better is exercise and you have to stay fit to be a Marine so maybe I'll get a lot better if I get in.
Thanks man. 




 I don't know, ever since I was in elementary school I thought that being in the armed services was the coolest thing ever. And there are times where I try and pick a different career path, but I just go back to thinking about being a Marine.
I want to learn skills about how I should go about being a leader, and the bonds you make with the men next to you.
 




 Yeah, I had no idea it was a big deal until he said that I can't join and that no one will take me for a year.
I had to go online and read about it today, which was a surprise.
I feel like I can ween off my mood stabilizers/anti-depressants, and I'm scheduling an appointment to see if I can.
I was getting ready to hit the gym to so I can pass the physical tests too. Well, Now I have a year to get in better shape (not saying I'm in bad shape, I just don't think I can pass the test)
Its one year, school gets out in 6 months, summer is 2 months, so really all I'm missing out on is 4 months. Sure I won't get to go with my friends, but I'll get to go someday. 




 Thank you for serving.

I will look at the videos you have provided.
I have at least another year before they will take me, so maybe I'll think about it harder. People have told me to join as an officer and such.
 




 So, I learned today by a recruiter that any branch of the armed service will not take you if you're on depression medication, and will only take you if you've been off for a year with doctors consent.
So that put a little damper on my parade, I've wanted to join since I was little and I learn I cannot.
Sorry, I just wanted to express and inform people who might want to join some day.

Darn, I was excited too.. 




 Looks clean, nice fogged lights man! 




 I'd love a Metro key if you still have one, never played it but it looks really interesting.

Thanks man, your generosity amazes me. 




 Eh, personally don't like it. 




 Nothing. So I guess, calm. Then afterwards regret cause now I'm treated differently. 




 Couldn't see, not good at side angles. Haha, My apologies mate, thanks! 




 SVT Cobra, or Shelby? :o 




 I like the blackout. A lot. 




 I'm 17 and I want a Cobra.

Jesus, if this happened to me, I'd be so devastated. 




 Fuck. So I'm not alone.

Edit: Yeah I noticed I've gone down a bit and getting up isn't easy.. 




 Exactly. 




 Its actually lighter than 2014. And It does look like it should be on a Taurus. 




 Kinda sad about the style. It just blends in with Fusions and Taurus's IMHO. 




 I'm smiling. Wow. Thats just the cutest thing. :D 




 whoa. 




 Still in love with your car. 




 I'm on mood stabilizers, so there is that option. 




 I'm glad you're at least feeling something different. :) 




 you really had to look through all of his comments.. wow. 




 wat 




 Yeah I'm now just any RDM = 1 hr, come back and do it again 1 day, then after that its perma. I don't have time for 14 yr old kids trying to be Seananners. 




 I used to be relax but more and more I'm becoming stricter. It's becoming a real pain with the RDM. 




 I.. What? 




 Feelin' good with the bit coins I see. Hopefully he uses them :D 




 wat 




 Yeah, for real, thats a sick addition to the car. 




 Its something you wouldn't ever expect to see, at least for me it is. 




 The blue trimmed wheels look nice. 




 Ahhhh jealous. 




 Awesome!! 




 I was being completely serious, thanks for the help! 




 But the question is, do condoms fuck anything up. 




 Believe me, I'm looking for power but sleek and sexiness, I might as well go for the Cobra unless I can find a reasonable Mach 1 with some extra HP from stock. 




 I'm very, very jealous. I'm torn between wanting a race/performance/torch/whatever-you-want-to-call-it red Cobra or Mach 1.

Love how clean your car looks. How much did you get it for/do you have any numbers?

*edit: word 




 Mach 1, but either is actually good. 




 I cringed. 




 Ouch, our feelings... 




 I was open to close friends, and then got sent away 3 times and now people think I'm just acting like it but not really depressed. Oh well. 




 Adorable :p 




 No. 




 I'm alliance, but I would never disrespect the horde, especially one who died.  




 Is that a mustang model car I see....  




 Some people these days... Jeez, I'm sorry you have to deal with people like that. 




 Yes, simply put. 




 Oh thanks so much :D Sorry if it was a problem! 




 Oh my god, if you're still up for it can you do me? If not, that's completely cool!


[This is me](https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/1375909_634419609936813_1235110306_n.jpg) 




 It was a sad day for us Huskies.. 









 why put a cobra anything on something thats not a cobra..? 




 Shhhh, don't comment if you didn't read the article. 




 I don't like the front end, but to each their own. 




 Huh, Maybe I'll chose to get a Term instead of a Mach then.. Thanks mate! 




 Nice, out of all of them which do you enjoy driving more? 




 I'm so jealous. I might hate you, but love you.
Sweet Mach and Term mate.
How much was all that? 




 I love it. 




 What Oni said. 




 Unless you hate the color, do it. 




 If you can, that'd be awesome. :) Thanks! 




 Oh dude/dudet, that's so awesome! Thank you very much :D 




 If its not too late, can you draw me :)?

https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc1/1176186_623513821027392_1260561400_n.jpg 




 such a smooth gif... 




 I liked my IOP (was for teens), but I wasn't in there long, so I too would like to hear what people have to say and their experiences. 




 Its 7pm, why would we be sleeping. 




 No I got what you were saying. Sorry if it came off rude. 




 I could easily get 100 on BF3, no problems, I understand its the first day, but its so jumpy. 




 Anyone else getting low jumpy FPS?

My rig is:
i5 2500k @ 3.30 GHz
8GB Ram
GTX 670 2gb

and I have the 331.40 Beta drivers installed.

I don't understand, I can't even run this on Low.


(Sorry if this doesn't belong here)
 




 that was.. beautiful.. 




 So clean, looks awesome! 




 Can't wait to see what she/he looks like when it's all cleaned up! 




 Ugh, Mach 1 3 




 That is amazing. Very jealous. 




 The noises I made watching this weren't human.
Certainly WTF. 




 Well, R.I.P 




 Anytime! 




 Not every car has to be a "female" :P, good for you for being a nonconformist! He looks good. Congratulations! :D 




 It's okay, it's just a cupcake in your eye. 




 I just saw a dude fuck a baked chicken and cum into it.

Why does that even exist? 




 It has to be in my town, well then. 




 Ah that would explain it D:, hopefully one day you could give a few hundred more miles on it. It's a beauty!  




 Can someone explain why get a fast car but never drive it, not being rude, just curious why pay 60k for a car you never really drive.
Thanks!
(BTW, looks nice ;) ) 




 PC. You?
 




 Lucky, my family doesn't like to game with me.. :( 




 Awesome! 




 Lovely simple pony. 




 Beautiful. 




 Oh, so lucky. I wish I could find one around here for that. The only Mach 1 is a Zinc Yellow for 15k.
Anyways, very cool car, wish I could have one. 




 How much was it? 




 I am completely jealous of your Mach 1, it looks beautiful. 




 Can I be a fairy too? 




 Ouch, my feelings. 




 Yeah bro, cause a 5.0 isn't much. 









 "Daddy loved you"

Chills and feels.

Glad you're alive, even if its just for now. 





























 As long as its just stating HP, I feel fine with it, It's not like you're saying its a rare model or adding cobra badges to it. 




 I can only dream of seeing one in person. 




 We can all take turns owning it, I get it all of May though. ;P 









 Yeah you do. My friend posted on Facebook from BT 









 Not really.. 
The Bullitt Mustang was offered in only three colors: Dark Highland Green, Black, and True Blue.

According to Wiki. 




 You mean if I actually went outside today I could have seen these? 




 He said no financing on the Fiero since its old. And since me and my friend look like we're 12 he must have thought they just want a joy ride, which if we wanted a joy ride we'd go look at Roush's or GT's, not a 135hp Fiero... :P 




 Do you have 11 grand? ;P

The guy wouldn't even let me and my friend ride in any of the cars unless we had the cash right then. Silly. 




 Welcome to how things are ran. 




 Well, she didn't pass it. So.. 




 Arizona won't let that happen. She's not THAT stupid..  




 Hopefully I can get one sooner rather than later! 




 Jeez, how long have you had it and how old are you now? If you don't mind me asking, I'm just trying to figure out how long it took you to get your dream car :P 




 How much did it cost for you? Jeez, I'd do anything just to SIT in one, let alone own one! 




 You literally have my dream car, a Torch Red 10th Anniversary Cobra.

Gah! Do you have any numbers? I'm so jealous of you right now.
Has it been modified, and if so what ways? 




 I got an email a few days ago saying I signed up for it. The thing is, I've never touched anything to do with BitCoins, and I went to look at what it meant and it had my name, first, middle, and last. It also had my birthday almost to the exact everything, but was off by 1 day. They also had my email. So I went in and changed everything, thankfully they didn't have any proof of ID, so it wasn't a full active account. 




 We can hope it will get struck down, no one here likes it. 




 ooooh something without support fell and it happened to be under your car. WTF man! Wow! 




 yes!

 Yes, 4chan can downvote and upvote.

 Dear god, I love those. 




 Fiber is coming to my state, but is just out of my reach. It's in Phoenix and I'm in Chandler.

I'm so mad. 




 If you have anymore picture feel free to post them at [r/NewEdgeMustang](http://www.reddit.com/r/NewEdgeMustang), It'd be awesome to see more New Edges :) 




 Shes giving more exposure to the world what is happening. Hopefully that bring more people in to help. 




 Wait so they beat the snipers to death? 




 I'll try and get some people, plug in this sub in some Mustang posts if they feature a new edge.

Happy to be here moderating! 




 Torch Red, it's so bright and an awesome attention grabber. 




 We're sorry o' great one. 




 I'd be interested. 




 Stuff like this makes me think if anyone has ever uploaded my early high school pictures.  




 So, you made it look like a Cobra.... 




 Pizza. 




 Tumblr. 




 You mean, someone would lie? 














 Once one opinion in the comments gets some upvotes, it becomes the popular opinion of the entire comment section, and everyone scrambles to make a comment agreeing with the top comment to get that juicy Karma. 




 ITT: Suddenly reddit cares about feelings. 




 Me either man.. me either.. 




 Anytime. :) 




 Looks beautiful. God damn. 




 Its 3 commercials per show. Its not bad. 




 I've learned that every comment on gonewild posts, are just really cringe worthy. 




 Woah dude, nature, WTF man? 




 Yeah, for what I'm getting it at, and how many miles it has, it's definitely going to need a swap. But I'm just hoping it can last a little bit so I can use it to get to work/school, before it dies on me. 




 Yeah, definitely cool. No doubt about it. Not a whole lot of power either, but definitely something different. 




 I know! And Its not like you see them everywhere (at least in my area), and I just got a video of it and WOW does it sound really nice on top on looking good.
I wonder why they're so cheap. 




 You are right on that cheap part, hahaha. I think it looks pretty good stock, I don't know why people try to make things look like how they're not.  




 The one I'm thinking about buying is normal, I mean it has 2 stripes but other than that it's pretty normal.
Does anyone know why the Fiero has a ton of body kits for it, it seems? 




 Civ 3, or 4, or 5, or Pirates! :P

Q. How do you make an egg-roll?
A. You push it!

:) Thanks 




 Thanks man for the giveaway, good luck everyone! 




 They're beautiful in person, pictures can't capture it all. Nice spot! 




 We.. We all aren't.. I have some MLP things too.. 




 Yeah it's something like 50% to get past legality. 




 Yeah. But you get a whole new car basically and a warranty. Still, it's a lot for what it is. 




 Oh he's there already, half shaved head, piecing, all that fun stuff! 




 It was actually just yesterday! They had a open house, free food, drinks, rally fighter rides, Boy Scouts were there, it was quite a lot of fun.
Yeah they added that extension but now it's just inside the building, I got a picture of it! 




 He just uploaded a picture of the book, "The Satanic Rituals" 




 Yeah... well, North Korea reached the Sun, so we're behind. 




 That's probably my favorite front end of any car. 




 [Heres the side view + a kind inside view](http://imgur.com/a/VVtbk)

I don't know how to get a video off of Facebook. Will try though! 




 Its supposed to be about one of the members ex girlfriend, or so I heard. 




 I only have a side view and a video of my ride in one. Its so comfy even when you're in the air. 




 Gotcha. 




 Ah, gotcha, there is a whole Satanic bible talk that's hidden since it got a lot of down votes. Totally skimmed it. My bad. 




 I'm pretty sure he responded to the wrong comment. :P 




 Yeah... 




 No idea, there was a different military truck as well. 




 [A song by them](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MB6mhKQxdHc),
And I don't know how to post a picture/If its allowed since it shows them and him.
But there is a bigger band with the same name as them, and I don't understand why they kept the same name. 









 Oh you should see the "band" he's in.. 









 I'm glad that you are feeling different and make a change and helping others. Hopefully others will see this and want to change too. :) 




 License plate is BRB666 




 What game was it? :o 




 wow nature. WTF? 




 It was amazing to go in when no one was there. 




 I've never used a online currency like bitcoin or anything, but dogecoin sounds pretty cool, and you're giving out free coins, so sure I'll try. 




 Thank you! 




 I don't think we are allowed to assist you in your suicide, but we do want you to know that we are here for you whenever you need someone to talk to.

Think twice, please.. 




 Is there any ETA on this? I cannot wait to play!
Thanks! 




 I love that color on any Mustang but definitely on a Cobra. My god. 




 share some love at [/r/NewedgeMustang/](http://www.reddit.com/r/NewedgeMustang/) 




 You're friends dumb (reference to 4th edit), she probably won't stop using now. 




 waiting. ;D 




 I like it, I just dislike how much empty space is in the rear, See? Different likes. :P 




 Lol, it's cool. We all have different likes. I'll take my down votes with pride. 




 Went to Barrett Jackson on Friday and saw the '15's in person, and its an OK looking car from the side, I dislike to front though. 




 What. 




 Lol, because being rude helps.

"After reading about the chrome and paint coming off, I decided to spray a couple layers of clear coat on them. Made them shine a little more and no peel over time.
Over 12 months installed. Maybe 6 on the road and out of the garage."                                                                          
[item it was found on](http://www.americanmuscle.com/46-supercharged-emblem-black.html) 




 try buying new ones and putting clear coat? I think thats what I saw on an americanmuscle customer review. 




 I'd agree with Mcflyguy, stock or dark smoked headlights are the way to go. But really, it's whatever floats your boat. Looks clean though! 




 Ah okay, thanks man. 




 Probably my favorite front of any style besides the 60's. 




 didnt work still, and lost the link. oh well. 




 ohmygosh, you have natural selection 2 :o
I'd be cool if you gifted it to me, but if not thats fine too. :)

 but it says GT on the side. 




 [here](http://www.americanmuscle.com/46-supercharged-emblem-black.html), 
Thats if you just want to replace it completely, which might be the best option.

Also a comment that might be important to you (found in the comments on the item): After reading about the chrome and paint coming off, I decided to spray a couple layers of clear coat on them. Made them shine a little more and no peel over time.
Over 12 months installed. Maybe 6 on the road and out of the garage.

P.S. : Nice GT man. 




 That's fucking clean. 
























 no need to be rude about it man.. 




 Just put a 5.0 in the Mach and go crazy.
I'm biased though since I like the New Edge look and the Mach look. 




 Beats mine, man. I would kill to upgrade. 




 nope. 




 AWH SHIT, YA GOT ME WITH MY 12 YEAR OLD.
How will I ever survive now.. 




 So cool to be an asshole, jeez man, it's his car. Fuck off if you don't like it. He can do whatever he wants.
I think it's pretty cool, since I've only seen it once. 




 72k miles in 2 years? 




 Is that a bad thing?
-cracks knuckles- 




 Any more pictures? I'm jealous! 




 Just got her. 









 Well, shit.. 




 Fuck yeah man, manual widows! And someone said that there's an auto detailing subreddit, which could help with the paint and stuff, so you might wanna check that out! 




 Yeah, I'm not a fan of them, but it's what I gotta deal with for a tiny bit of time, and it's the least of my worries.
I will check out auto detailing, and see what they recommend! Thank you! 




 I got her for 1750$, which, for what it is, was surprising. I might need to do a new engine in the future, but I think it will last me at least some time, since I'll mainly only use it to get to work which is ~10 minutes away at most.
I don't plan on running it hard. Thankfully! 




 I'm dumb, I read interior.
Yeah, I mean there's some fading, only on the front by the headlights, so it's not too bad. I will definitely try my best to keep it as clean and nice as possible. 




 Yes, yes it does. That was the main thing I was looking for! 




 I feel you, I don't love it, but it's sort of grown on me since after looking for a car, they're all I can find!
I need to deoxy the headlights, touch up some paint, and she'll be a beaut!
Thank you for the kind words. 




 Believe me, I HATE when people try to make a car something its not.
I haven't gotten it up to anything, unless you count 15-20ish "up", I need to go get tags and all that fun stuff since I literally just got it.
I'm quite excited to play around with it! 




 '95 v6 5 speed 









 I was gonna give you a baby for the 5.0.. damn. 




 Please. 




 Oh I know, its one of the the few blues that I actually have interest in, and holy shit, that must be a thing to see. I've only ever seen one Mach in my area and it was a cobra swap, not as cool other than the glass window in the hood where the shaker was and the neon lights. :P 




 Yeah, its definitely a nice crowd, I've been looking at the Machs, specifically the Azure Blue with a new Engine in it. 




 I've been looking at them for so long, just drooling over them. SVTPerformance has so many great termis, that it hurts to log on to it :( 




 Am I the only one who hasn't gotten one yet.
God damn it. 




 They look purpleish-blue to me. 




 Jack/Geoff 




 Fucking lovely.
Nice ride man. 




 Oh I do too, Currently trying to talk to my credit union to see if I can get it.

 Nawh brah, you don't, you wouldn't be player hatin' 




 Its a Shelby Cobra emblem. 




 brah, gtfo, we don't want you anyways. go enjoy your civic. 




 Yeah, that's what I use. Hoping they'll give me enough for a decent new edge. :D 




 Brah, brah, please. I'm trying to get a loan right now to join the cool kids club. 




 Good. Bitch. 




 OP, pls... 




 Thats an insanely clean Saleen, any more details? And Karma? This subreddit gets MAYBE 10 upvotes hahaha. ;) 




 I rarely find colors that I like, but lava really is beautiful, so is Mystichrome but we can't get that nowadays factory. 




 God I love lava red... 




 Come on Heer_, you're making me a bit too jealous. :(

Gorgeous like always, but maybe a bath would be in need soon. ;P 




 You're all in /r/wtf, did you expect ponies and rainbows. Expect NSFW/L, Gore, ect...  




 So he's a GRAPIST too? 




 Thank you for your answer, and I understand it's a stressful job, and they give you no slack. I've been actually doing really fine, no problems, but then again I still have 9 months until I can MAYBE join, so we'll see if anything changes. Thanks again! 




 Ooooh, I get you! 




 That's my bike. 




 But there is also more v6s than v8s, so that kinda helps out v6s in the lead here. Not saying your wrong though, driver error and neglect is a big part, and I was saying that since he's a teen, he's not gonna be the best at handling power, and paying attention. 




 Idk, I've seen some really stupid football players. No offense to your son, or your family name. And I'm not doubting you, I'm just saying! Hopefully he is mature enough to handle that beautiful beast, and tell him I said congrats on getting a ride to college! It's a lot more than I could have done, haha! 




 Awesome! Thanks! 




 You're 120hp lower than him, though. 




 He's gonna crash it, bet ya 10$. 




 Has no one realized, that they shouldn't use Red Box? 




 I like them, they have a lot of special editions in those years, like the Mach 1, Cobra, Crimson red 40th, Roush, and Saleen which all look incredible. In my opinion they have the best rear of any Mustang, but power isn't huge unless you get a Mach, which has the equivalent power of a recent V6, or a 03/04 Cobra since that's 390hp.  




 *oh* 




 I would definitely go back to golden brown, man. 




 I feel you. I'm going for a Mach 1 in about a month, hopefully I'll have enough funds to get it. I really want a TR 10th Termi but that'll run me 22+ for what I want with it. 




 SVTPerformance has them from 17-35 depending on mods/mileage. Pretty good stuff! 




 WHYY! 




 Hahahah! 




 OP pls respond. 




 Hudson River was a Narrow body, OP is talking about Wide body.
Source:All dem comments. 




 She's 15, not 5. 




 ITT: Suddenly everyone cares about feelings. 




 Yeah, the Mach 1s were styled from the 69's and 70's, hence the style of the gauges, stripes (side and hood), spoiler, hell even the seats! I think they look really good TBH, it's way different from the other NewEdges. 




 I know, he takes care of it! And yes they are factory! 




 Ouch dude, that blows. Thankfully you're alright! Hopefully you get what you want out of this, like you said, a V8! 




 Yeah, hopefully! haha. It's beautiful. 




 Nice, a lightning! 




 My god. 




 It looks really good for it's age.
Nice NewEdge man! 




 C'mon pls. 




 Aww, I feel so bad for him. 




 This is 5 days old, I don't know why you thought the input was needed. 




 I give them credit, that was pretty clever. 




 xD!! 2Funneh! 




 What the fuck. 




 PlS dO ThaT!  




 He's "eye" has a small Purple Heart inside of it. He's probably not ashamed by it and decided to not care, I mean if I had a Purple Heart in my eye, that'd be sick as shit.

Yup. 




 I'd love to help! Don't get me wrong, but I need to focus more on my life and helping myself get through and over obstacles. I will return though to help out. :) 




 Yeah, I'd definitely try to see how low I can go. And probably look at terminators too, since they're my dream car. Gonna be hard to find a TR 10th for under 20k :( 




 Thank you, if I feel down in the dumps, I most definitely will be back for a check up. :) 




 Thank you, that made me laugh! 




 Ha! 




 Thank you all for your kind worded comments. I woke up with a huge smile on my face. :) 




 Cool brah. 




 I replied to the guy who replied to you. It was aimed at both of you, and if you'd like you can read it as reply.

Thank you for your input, and I understand where you're coming from. :) 




 It's definitely about how you look at it.
I understand that it's hard, and you get yelled at, which is fine. It toughens you up. I've wanted to join since I was a small child, it is about pride to me and about the benefits of college, friendship, and strengthening myself. My uncles have gone through it all, and one of my only friends has been enlisted for little over a year in the Marines. Whilst another is currently in BT for the Army.

Yeah you can get lonely, homesick, and all that. But that's life, and that's what I choose.

Thank you, and the guy you commented to, for both of your inputs. I greatly appreciate it! 




 Thank you. 




 Cobras are my favorite. If you have more pictures, r/NewedgeMustang would love to see it. :) 




 Idk man, either way she doesn't look like a Chloe. PERSONAL OPINION RIGHT HERE THOUGH. 




 [Idk man, she looks like Ellen Page.](http://i.imgur.com/BSGQ5I1.jpg) 




 Really hoping to get a NewEdge as soon as I land my job interview tomorrow. ;) 









 Thankfully this one only puts down 405, and not 600's like some of them. ;) 




 That a big fucking probably. 




 Ah, now I see! Would love to see it when you have the new wheels!
