 I don't see why approaching mental states as legitimate subjects of inquiry should entail that they are irreducible. 

I would distinguish between mental and inner states. A "mental state" could just be a stage of a process, like a machine state. An "inner state" to me presupposes some sort of qualitative barrier between process and perception.

My whole point in this discussion is basically I don't know how qualia could ever be considered "states" in the "machine state" or "process state" mould, therefore we can't talk about qualia without presupposing a different kind of "state" that is not a stage of a process.

In other words, I am arguing that reductionism rules out qualia and consciousness as legitimate concepts. That doesn't mean I consider reductionism *wrong* (I am up in the air about that), merely that I think those are the inevitable consequences of accepting it.

we already know a lot more than we did 20 years ago about how the brain handles vision, conscious awareness, religious experiences...

I'd agree with the first and last of those, but not the middle one. Explaining the neural correlates of consciousness is not explaining consciousness, unless doing so can "explain away" consciousness as a meaningful idea, a la Dennet's attempt.

I think that consciousness, as well as qualia, must either be null or radically other. I don't see the middle ground like you seem to.

The idea that maybe they [animals] are just automata that happen to behave in a certain way while experiencing nothing is a remote skeptical possibility akin to "what if we're really brains in a vat?" or "what if other humans are really unconscious zombies?"

It's not remote since many believe that we humans are such automata as well. We can at least say that humans have the *concept* of qualia, even if it turns out not to refer to anything. We can't communicate this concept to animals so we have no way of telling what qualitative experience they may or may not have.

On the ethical side, though, I agree with you: In the absence of strong evidence otherwise it is ethical to assume that humans and animals both experience qualia.

Since our qualia seem to be in continual flux, that suggests to me that it must be a process (or more likely, a set of processes).

I think you're confusing change in stimuli with mental processes. They're two different things. I'm saying - how does qualia fluctuate *if the stimuli remains the same*? A point stimuli or a constant stimuli can kick off a whole cascade of processes but it only seems to generate one immediate, constant quale. Red only becomes "less red" when the rods in my eyes saturate (a physical process). The fact that the quale goes away when I look at something else is not the issue.

then some subset of those feedback connections would be projecting into the visual cortex and incorporating that information into the stream of consciousness. 

The problem is, it doesn't appear as a "stream" or a "process," but as a pointlike experience. Obviously a process assembles that experience before it is "presented" to the awareness, but what is it that can apprehend the entire process instantaneously?

Again, it's not enough to say "well, it really doesn't happen instantaneously, we've proven in the lab that there's a lag of 40 milliseconds" or whatever. Why does it *appear* instantaneous? Where does this sense come from? 

Why a major problem [with Blindsight]? To me it just suggests that it's possible to have a visual experience (however degraded) that one is not consciously aware of. 

Because it argues against the *role* consciousness has been assigned in current reductionist theories, which is as *the name we give to the processing of stimuli via mental states.* Here is a complex mental state in response to a stimuli, with *no conscious component*. That's a huge problem in my book.

Reductionists could fall back on the older view of consciousness as a pure epiphenomenon, an "impotent narrator," but that view has been out of fashion for some time and for good reason.

maybe there is crosstalk in the circuits which, while relatively data-poor, allows patients to perform slightly above chance (which is all they find in performance tests).

[This article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7794783.stm) seems to suggest something a good deal more shocking than "performing slightly above chance." Key quote:

"A video recording shows him completing the obstacle course set up by the scientists "flawlessly", without the aid of his cane or another person."

Also he can respond to facial expressions which is one of the most complex tasks of the brain and I doubt it can be explained by weak cross-talk.

You might be interested in the work of Colin McGinn on this subject.

I can only wonder if these pessimists have ever actually opened a neuroscience textbook, because the way they talk, you'd expect neuroscience books to be 2 pages long!

A lot of them are Philosophers of the Mind, so I *hope* they have read neuroscience, though you never know. Anyway the pessimists aren't so much saying "we can never figure out the brain" in the heuristic sense of figuring out what region processes what, as they are saying that the "deep truths" we want to find by studying the brain, such as "is reductionism true?" simply aren't accessible, and perhaps aren't even intelligible concepts.

Note this is different from saying "consciousness isn't an intelligible concept," it is a level of abstraction removed. The pessimists are saying "asking whether or not consciousness is an intelligible concept is not an answerable question."

Going back to McGinn again he is also sympathetic to this idea though I think at heart he's a non-reductionist though he doesn't declare openly for that.

I'm not one of these pessimists myself but the way that very smart people (a lot more educated than I am) continually seem to talk past and misunderstand each other on this subject makes me queasy that they may be right.

 Thanks. Oh, and I forgot to add:

4.) The hope that close attention to the details will allow for a better foundation upon which attacks on the "big problems" can resume in the future. This view holds that the previous attacks failed because of shaky foundations. Bad definitions, muddled logic, etc. 




 I have no idea what you're talking about but there's a number of works on the intersection between mathematics and philosophy.

One category is the philosophical basis of mathematics (Godel's theorem, Cantor, etc.)

But I think what you're interested in is the converse: A possible mathematical basis for philosophy. On that topic Badiou has been recently popular. 




 1.) over-specialization, a desire to "professionalize" philosophy so that it resembles other university disciplines.

2.) lack of progress on the "hard" questions leading to frustration, giving up, lack of funding.

3.) the view that there are no "hard" questions, just illusions of language. 




 The tendency to over-define vague terms and then follow those definitions to their logical conclusions gets philosophers into muddles.

True, and that might be the problem with qualia. 

I fear we're constructing a pantheon of very slippery inner states, and then postulating new mental states to cover up for the holes in our initial description. In this practice, we quickly reach a point where our main limiting factor is our imagination.

That's my fear also.

My worry is not that there aren't any such inner states to describe, but that our description is theory-rich and data-poor, and therefore we may be misdescribing them rather badly.

I hope so, and I hope more data might shed some light on these questions. However, as of now I can't see a way out of the trap. Accepting "inner states" to any degree seems to entail accepting the whole ridiculous pantheon of irreducible and incommensurable qualia. Rejecting "inner states" means discounting phenomenological observation altogether, which seems almost as ridiculous.

Can't we be pretty sure that animals experience pain? They behave like they're in pain, they have neural wiring similar to that which processes pain in humans, similar stimuli seem to cause pain in animals. 

I'm not as confident. We don't know where in the brain qualia are produced, if they even exist (and if they are even produced by the brain, if they exist.) They may be produced only in the prefrontal cortex, which animals don't possess to the same degree. Animals may simply process the stimuli of pain without any accompanying qualia. It's impossible to know, but I also think it's immoral to assume that they don't and that it's ok to hurt animals.

(btw, the fact that almost all moral systems are implicitly based on the existence of qualia is what makes a lot of people so leery about qualophobes, regardless of the evidence.)

This isn't obvious to me. Actually since qualia fluctuate over time, it seems to me that they are almost certainly processes.

How do qualia fluctuate in your view? Do you mean only if the stimuli changes? We would agree there. But not if the stimuli remains the same. They seem to be point-like experiences to me. Sure, a color will fade if you look at it too long because the rods in your eyes get saturated, but that's a different issue.

A desktop computer is a serial processor and will process these in sequence... whereas our brain's architecture is massively parallel, allowing it to perform many computations simultaneously. 

Actually, modern computers are massively parallel as well. I'm not denying that the brain processes imagery in parallel. Obviously it does. What bothers me is that these parallel processes then seem to produce outputs that are presented to our awareness as a unity.

Blindsight shows that visual stimuli response can function independently of any visual experience. This is a major problem for reductionists.

I have a feeling you're going to tell me this doesn't help, but I'm not sure why.

I'm concerned with how we experience a process as a unity, a point-like experience. That's where I see a weakness in the reductionist argument. 

If the non-reductionists can somehow tame the zoo of qualia, I might "go over" to their side. I'm not there yet though. I'm more thinking a third approach might be needed, but I have no idea what that could be. 

I'm also more sympathetic now than I used to be to the epistemological pessimists who think the mind can no more think about itself than a hammer can hammer itself, that our minds are designed to be "turned outwards towards the world" and that too much introspection on mental states inevitably leads to logical knots, simply because we're not designed to process that sort of information.
 




 I'm not too familiar with this position. Is this Dennett's view?

More or less. Though he's too canny to ever say so in such simple terms, in my reading he thinks both qualia and consciousness are "null pointers" - words that don't really refer to anything meaningful. For a while I thought he had the true picture - right down the the competing networks of Darwinian neurons fighting for dopamine - but now I'm not so sure.

higher vs. lower functions...

I would take a Heideggerian approach to this question. Anything "ready to hand" that we can use in a transparent fashion without  rational thinking is a lower function, even if it was set by practicing it as a higher function (for example that choke hold, which had to be puzzled out and learned before it became automatic) Anything "unready to hand" that requires us to activate our reasoning skills is a higher function. 

I'm not sure if I agree with the entailment from propositional attitudes to qualia or not. If I say "I believe that 2+2=4" how would we characterize the corresponding quale?

*Believing* it, as opposed to merely using the fact in a process, would entail the quale of the emotion of belief, the feeling we get when we look at something we know to be true. 2 + 2 = 5 is not just a false statement, it triggers a different quale when we see it (in the qualophile's view.)

we want to know why all this processing is accompanied by "inner feels." Maybe 'qualia' is not the best concept with which to get a handle on the problem, but turning a blind eye to it doesn't seem like a solution.

Exactly.  I agree. However, the reason *why* I agree has to do with the simultaneity of visual perception, which I will try to explain below.

I think a strong case can be made for the existence of qualia in non-linguistic animals (think animal pain, blue dot on the forehead test, food preferences, etc.)

I'm not sure. If you believe in qualia, you believe there's a difference between "seeing blue" the way a computer can (or seeing a face the way Cottrel's network can), and really *seeing blue* (seeing the quale not processing the wavelength.) Since we can't communicate like this with animals, we can't know for certain either way.

Damn. Sorry man, I'm just not understanding why this is a problem.

Ok, I'll be glad to try again. Thanks for sticking with this discussion! 

Reductionist theories of mind run into a problem when they encounter mental phenomena that *don't seem to be processes*. Thought is a process. Emotion, Demasio and others have argued with merit, is a process. Qualia are obviously not processes but the very concept of qualia is shaky. 

But what about visual perception? Phenomenologically, it doesn't seem (and seeming is what's important here, since we're talking about inner states) that I see first the cat, then the lamp, and process these two concepts like a computer program would that could recognize multiple objects in a picture (these do exist.)

Rather, I seem to apprehend both of them *at the same time*. Visual perception appears not to be a process but rather a *pointlike experience* that is nevertheless very rich in data.

It is the nature of visual perception, at once pointlike in time and vast in the amount of stimuli that is perceived, that seems very un-process-like.

If we accept that it is not a process, we should also be more open to the idea that other non-processed mental states like qualia also might exist (where there's one monkey, there's more...). 

I'm starting to suspect that qualia might indeed exist, and only be *mediated* by language, which can open or foreclose access to them depending on the grammar, and not created as an illusion of language, and the reason there's no sharp cutoff between "redness" and "orangeness" is because there's just one color qualia that exists as a continuum.

But this opens a huge can of worms. Qualia must either be null or *radically* Other, beyond all category of thought or understanding. Even a thoroughgoing dualism in the traditional sense seems to leave no room for qualia. You would need an unbounded pluralism of incommensurable experiences, each its own separate ineffable Universe and yet somehow united within our minds. That sounds like the sort of conceptual disaster that usually results from having started from wrong premises.

So I'm still torn on the qualia issue.

Is there a wiki page on this?

I couldn't find anything more specific than stuff on qualia and the Hard Problem. There are some technical articles that talk about the problems of simultaneity and I remember reading about this issue in Penrose and Chalmers (who proposed quantum and dualistic solutions, respectively.) 




 making the most serious attempts to give a legitimate explanation of qualia (as opposed to the defeatists who seem to suggest that qualia are magical and inexplicable).

Or those who think they're just a trick of language?

"Language of thought" folks believe that this is essentially language-like whereas eliminativists of the Churchland variety think that the brain's basic cognitive processes are rather non-language-like

I think both views are simplistic. Our "higher" cognitive functions are obviously language-like in processing, at least in my view, whereas "instinct"-type reactions are not. Habits fall in between the two - that's why they can be so hard to break.

As far as I can tell the questions are entirely independent. 

Why I think the two issues are fundamentally the same is that, as far as I understand the concept, a propositional attitude must have an intentional object. It is hard to see how such an object can be anything other than a quale. 

If there truly are propositional attitudes such as "I would like to have a beer," rather than simple processes that report such sentences as part of their functioning, then the quale for the taste of beer is implied.

I know the eliminationists don't believe in these attitudes, and I thought they didn't believe in quales either, but you say they are merely "reductionist" in relation to quales. I don't quite see the difference because according to the classic definition at least, quales are irreducible. A reduced quale is a non-existent one.

Skeptical in what sense? Skeptical that the term 'qualia' refers to anything at all? 

Yes. For a while I was in the "it's all just a trick of language" school and I still think those arguments have a lot of merit. For example, if there is a quale that embodies "redness," when we see a color shift for example in a computer graphics display, we should notice a sharp cutoff where "redness" changes to "orangeness," but we don't. 

Also, people who speak languages that don't distinguish between "blue" and "green," Japanese for example, have been shown to be able to see less shades in that color range than English-speakers. All this points to quales somehow arising from language and not being fundamental.

Where I've started to doubt that view, however, is in the appearance of the simultaneity of visual perception. Looking at the room right now, I see a lamp, and a cat, *apparently at the same time*, and as distinct objects, not a blob combining the qualities of both (a furry, purring lamp for example.) 

How is this possible? If the mind is a mere process, how does this perception arise? There should only be reaction to visual stimuli, as with the Blindsight phenomenon, but nothing else. Yet something else appears that, unlike color quales, it is quite difficult to explain as a trick of language.

Before you chalk me up as a disciple of the Time Cube guy, the two dimensions of time and String Theory stuff was partly tongue-in-cheek, but this problem seems so vexing I wonder if this or a similarly bizarre explanation will eventually be needed.

What I was referring to is that in String Theory there are "extra" dimensions that are not linear, but rather curled around the three dimensions we know and love. Much like a tightrope walker will perceive a tightrope as one dimension, but an ant will see two (the ant can go forward and backward as well as around the "curled up" dimension that composes the rope itself.), in String Theory at a small scale our Universe has 10 or 11 spatial dimensions, not 3.

What I was proposing was that perhaps time also has a String Theory-like "curled up" dimension and that's how visual perception can be a process yet still somehow seem presented as a unity to the mind.

And of course Roger Penrose is a physicist who became interested in the philosophy of the mind and concluded that quantum physics must somehow be involved, launching an entire industry of bad New Age books misinterpreting his ideas. 




 Thanks for the detailed reply. You're lucky you got to work with some of the most eminent modern philosophers - whether I agree with them or not, that's quite an experience and one I wish I could have had.

So obviously your experience with them is very extensive and I'll take your word for it on what their true views are. However, I am puzzled by a couple of things you said:

believe that neuroscience science will explain qualia.

That is the qualophobic position, if I am correct. "phobic" is just an unfortunate appelation that this position got stuck with. It doesn't literally mean they are *afraid* to address the issue qualia, just that they think qualia can be reduced to neurology without either a dualistic or an emergent order.

they all agree that there is something wrong with folk psychology but they can disagree radically as to what (for the Churchlands, it's propositional attitudes, for others it's qualia or consciousness).

I don't think there's really much of a difference between propositional attitudes and qualia, fundamentally. They both seem to refer to mental states that can't be reduced to mere *processes*, and that's the real issue in my book.

I'm pretty skeptical about qualia myself, both internal and external, but the one phenomenon I don't think has been explained is the simultaneity of distinct objects of visual perception, and that one thread kind of lets everything else in again through the back door. 

It's not enough to say that vision merely *appears* simultaneous, obviously it's not and many studies have proven this (including the infamous "gorilla" experiment), because it's appearances that are the issue. Why should it appear simultaneous? How does this unity, however illusory it might be, manifest? I don't know of any reductionist philosopher who's explained that to my satisfaction.

I have an admittedly crazy theory that there are two dimensions of time, the other one curled up around our familiar dimension like the extra dimensions of String Theory, and that the unity of visual perception is processed in that dimension, using some Penrose-style quantum woo-woo hand-waving, and then somehow "presented" back to the ordinary mind as a unity.

So if you don't think I'm entirely bonkers after hearing that, I'd love to hear any further thoughts you might have on the subject, given that even formidable minds have said what we should do with this issue is just "sweep it aside and hope for the best" 
 




 I think he meant in physics, where three dimensions are privileged (see r3m0t's post), but that's interesting - I never knew that. 




 I don't think any philosopher from Plato on would disagree that "love" is a muddled concept that refers to many different things. 

I do think the Churchlands are far more radical than the rather uncontroversial critique you ascribe to them: In my reading of their position, they think "love" refers to not many different states, but to *nothing* - that the behaviors we ascribe to "love" have *no affective states behind them whatsoever*, any more than there is some being called Zeus behind the phenomenon of thunder.

In essence they are extreme qualophobes - they not only deny external qualia like "red," but internal qualia as well such as emotions. Some see them and the rest of the EM school as the heirs to the Behaviorists, but all the Behaviorists said was that the "black box" of internal states could not be studied scientifically - they never said that internal states didn't exist.

I've by no means read their corpus, so their position may have evolved since my last encounter with their work, but that's how I read their position at the time.

 Before you suggest "Ghost in the Shell," this was NOT Ghost in the Shell, I've seen every movie and episode, and this wasn't it.

What I remember for sure: It was quite similar to Ghost in the Shell. It involved cops in Japan with tank-like robot assistants. The plot was convoluted, but in the end it was revealed the evil mastermind was an old man who lived in a giant dome who was trying to merge trees and robots to create a new form of life. In the end his plot was foiled, but all the tank-robots were destroyed in the process.

 It also doesn't take into account the issue of land-values, on which productivity has no effect.

Productivity does affect land value. For example, after the invention of the elevator and modern building techniques, the value of land in or near a city increased dramatically due to the fact you can fit more people and/or make more products with the same amount of land than you could previously.

Likewise, the Internet and telepresence technology has affected land value, but in the opposite direction (reducing demand)

 There might be a mint there, but only if you can get past the media screaming about "ebonics" or some such nonsense. I can just imagine Limbaugh now: "New fake IQ test racist against whites! Makes blacks seem smart when they're not!"

As other posters mentioned, this is really a non-issue: Murray's own data shows economic status was the determining variable, not race, even if we admit "race" as a coherent, measurable concept, which I and most scientists have serious doubts about anyway. Remember there was a time when Italians and Jews were not considered "white," and now they are. 




 I agree, but that's not the conclusion he drew in the book. 




 He also fails to mention the rise of the war on drugs, and the increasingly large portion of the black male population that is in jail.

He did note that he focused exclusively on whites to avoid "ethnic issues." But the fact that this guy's book is called "The State of White America" raises the creepy level in the room just a bit. If this is the same Charles Murray who wrote "The Bell Curve," which suggested that blacks "naturally" have an IQ level 15 points below whites, it all starts to fit together. He's not worried about blacks because he thinks they're beyond hope anyway. 





























 The Dry Tortugas are indeed in the Caribbean. This is a different island with a similar name. "Tortuga" is Spanish for "turtle." 



















 I would prefer to use the term "strength of effect" when referring to a linear coefficient, and I would prefer that it be used in replacement of or at least along with correlation when reporting how variables are linked. 









 Only in our Galaxy. 




 In terms of pure math, you are correct, but when the general public hears the words "strongly correlated," that's not what they think. It is possible, after all to have some form of cancer be "strongly correlated" with weight, and yet have it that a 160 lb. person has a 2.1% chance of the cancer whereas a 250 lb. person has a 2.2% chance of the cancer. In cases like these unit invariance is irrelevant - reporting such a link as "strongly correlated" is misleading, even though technically accurate. 




 No... part of what it's showing is you get the same correlation value for many different patterns. Even if you just look at linear patterns, you can get the same correlation value with radically different slopes on the best-fit line. Two quantities can have a correlation of close to 1 (which would seem to imply a strong relation) and yet still be only weakly related in reality if the slope of the best-fit line is close to 0.

 Cartoons in general, especially old cartoons. The Macy's balloons really creep me out. 
























 I don't really think you get what I'm trying to say. Read the other posts in this thread, they explain it better than I do.

The point is, 0!=1 is not a "tack on" that has nothing to do with the rest of the definition of a factorial and is just there for convenience so we don't end up dividing by zero. It is implied by the original definition. 




 Then the same can be argued about any mathematical function. It's not a "convention" in the way that placing the dependent variable on the left-hand side of an equation is a "convention."  0!=1 is suggested by the underlying concept itself, not just inherited tradition. 




 It's a convention, not a theorem. It's been chosen like that because it's useful.

No, that is not correct, it is in the structure of the idea of the factorial. Think of a baseball team of x players. There are x! ways for the coach to order them on a bench for photo. Now imagine if the coach simply wanted a picture of the empty bench (0 players.) There is only one way to order that photo. Therefore 0!=1

A similar argument can be made for the "inevitability" of such seemingly "hacky" definitions such as a^0 = 1. 


































 The reaction uses a secret catalyst

Stopped reading right there. Just another Cold Fusion scam and-or self-delusion. 




 I don't think we need any fancy Category Theory to solve this problem as some other posters have suggested.

You merely have to distinguish between declarable and constructable entities. For example, I can *declare* "a square circle" by saying these words, but I could never actually construct one.

Similarly, in Set Theory we can say "The set of all sets," but it is not clear if we mean declarable or constructable sets. The set of all declarable sets includes some sets which trigger Russel's Paradox, and thus are not constructable.

When a mathematician is saying "all sets this, all sets that," he is most likely referring to the set of all *constructable* sets.  




 Why a vow to free beings - or even just one's own being- if there are no beings to free?

Empty of *inherent* selfhood does not mean total emptiness of being, but rather than our selves are unavoidably dependent on the existence of other beings (dependent origination.)

So this is where the vow originates to free all beings - it cannot be any other way, since all being is tied up together. 




 I wasn't going as far back as Smith - just pointing out that Libertarianism was around when any person living today was in High School. 




 True, but if you have to have a graphic metaphor, horseshoe beats grid. Libertarianism, if not the modern Party, has been around quite some time. The grid metaphor got started as the "Nolan Chart." Nolan was a Libertarian. 









 Because as any high school politics student knows, political alignments are not on a line (they're more on a grid, with x and y coordinates, etc.) 

I'm more of a "horseshoe" guy. I think that grid is Libertarian propaganda: "Wow, look, there's a party that believes in *both* types of freedom!" 

Right and left are labels given by American propagandists in the McCarthy era.

No, they come from where the factions sat in the French National Assembly after the Revolution.

His mistake was making his country a socialist dictatorship (communism), rather than a socialist republic.

I don't think he had a choice once he seized power. The majority of the Russian people in 1917 were rural and religious. They would not have voted for Bolshevism if given the chance. A Tolstoy-style religious socialism might have had a better shot. 




 Doesn't matter what they actually do or the fact that social programs are not 'socialism'

Yes, I like how people do not get that social programs are actually a phenomenon of capitalism. There is no welfare in Socialism because everyone is guaranteed a job (and compelled to work.) 

I'm not saying that's a *good* thing, but welfare is Capitalism *preserving* itself from a possible Socialist uprising.

One of Lenin's slogans was "He who does not work, does not eat." Makes him sound like a Tea Party guy, which he was in some strange way, that way the far left and the far right always seem to converge.
 




 Elaborate perhaps? 









 Turkey pasta. Better than it sounds. 




  Politics has always contained a transcendental element (often a phony one used as a lure, but that's a different issue.) In terms of an incentive, few things beat the promise or even the hope of transcendence. 




 "the flawed, selfish nature of man" is a religious percept.

Maybe, but also a Darwinian one. I don't think you can ignore that without socialization to the contrary, human beings care about themselves, their "tribe," and little else. 




 The simple man wonders what's for dinner.

 It was probably similar to those old questions on the SAT about culture-specific stuff that were designed to keep Jews out of Harvard. Taffy is probably something poor Koreans don't see much of. 




 The school system can fail kids without repercussions if needed. The budget isn't set according to how many students graduate. 

This is key. In the US there is tremendous pressure on teachers to pass everyone because funding and ratings are based on "on-time" graduation rates.

 My only disappointment was getting to the bottom and finding out Qu8k isn't for sale (yet...) 





























 Very interesting. Thanks for the response. One thing you said in particular caught my eye:

There are castes among Christians and Muslims too. 

We often read in the Western media that low-caste Hindus and Dalits are converting to Islam or Christianity to escape the caste system. Is that exaggerated or false in your view?
 




 I know some Hindus (and a former one) who would disagree with you. It is true though that there is no central authority in Hinduism, so different groups might have different interpretations. 

By and large though, Hinduism is an inherited tradition. You can't just go sign up to become Hindu like you can for some other religions. The "Western Hindu" groups like the Hare Krishnas and the Rajneeshis are considered fake, heretical or just plain laughable by (most) actual Hindus. 




 Assuming "The West" means the current hegemonic system lead by the United States, I would advise you to beware the "rhetoric of decline" which is used for political manipulation and doesn't really represent the underlying reality. The US is still the world's largest manufacturer, food exporter and its military technology is light-years ahead of anyone else's.

Unfortunately a number of commenters here have bought in to this rhetoric full-scale. For example, one stated:

china and other nations find themselves with a young strong backbone 

China does not have a young, strong backbone. They overshot their population decades ago, experienced apocalyptic levels of starvation several times, and are still paying the price. Their demographics are completely upside down now and the very old will soon outnumber those of working age.

I wouldn't be surprised if the US, Latin America and India form the power troika of 40 years hence while China, Japan and Europe all suffer greatly just from demographic pressure alone. 

The US will probably no longer be the lone superpower c. 2050 but it's quite possible it will still be one of the top dogs.  




 American Indians can be Hindus too if they want

Not Orthodox. You have to be born in the caste system to be considered Hindu. They could always be Hare Krishnas or something though. 



















 I suspected it might be something like this. However, would it be possible to create substances that are *digestible*, but, for whatever reason, don't give any energy to the body and/or cannot be stored as fat? Or would that create metabolic havoc?

Ok, maybe not.
 




 The government of Zimbabwe is pretty powerful, at least internally. Just ask all their political prisoners and dispossessed farmers. 




 If relatively harmless drugs like marijuana were legal, people wouldn't do this synthetic stuff. It should be banned, but then, pot should be legal as well. 




 That's my point though. Habitual drug users with no history of violence all of a sudden go nuts when they use this stuff. It might be close chemically to THC but in terms of reaction it's more like PCP. It's a drug that is a danger to the public, not just to its users. 




 [Here is one story](http://www.wwaytv3.com/2011/09/01/one-dead-another-custody-after-overnight-shooting-rocky-point). You can find plenty more searching police registers and medical journals. 

There was a case in a town near ours of a guy high on "bath salts" who tunneled into his neighbor's basement trying to kill him because he thought the guy was having sex with his wife. He had been a longtime marijuana user with no criminal record beyond possession and no history of mental illness.

Part of the problem with "bath salts" is they can be many different chemicals - you don't know what you're getting. I agree with a previous poster who said if marijuana was legal none of this would be happening, because most often this stuff is advertized as "legal pot" and sold in skate shops, head shops, etc. which pot users frequent. 




 He argues that a gold standard would force the government back into the price-fixing business. Not sure that's correct, but an interesting perspective. 




 Do you know anyone who's done this stuff? I'm fine with people using drugs that kill them, not so fine with them using drugs that cause them to go nuts and kill other people.  




 This stuff is bad news. Lifelong potheads have tried it once and ended up in the loony bin. For once I don't have a problem with the DEA. 









 don' think human nature is very malleable (which is the most basic idea of any kind of socialism: that people are programmed by relations and circumstances)

Good post, but I'd disagree with you there. Many Socialists believe there is a basic unchangeable human nature, for example Marx's idea of "primitive Communism" representing the original state of Man that will eventually reappear in the final state.

In this view Capitalism is the temporary, un-natural aberration which is part of the reason why it will collapse. 














 I paid $8.50 for a birthday card at Hallmark. 99 cent store will be getting my greeting card business in the future. 




 True, but you can often counter-sue for damages that include your legal fees. I don't know how often that succeeds though. 









 Thanks, but it doesn't appear to be on the soundtrack. It was just background music to a few of the fights - the chanting might not have even been part of the "official" music track at all, I just really dug the combination. 









 Yeah, not quite what I had in mind, but thanks. 




 I heard such music in the background of a show (Soul Eater) and can't get the idea out of my head. Can't track down the artist though.  




 Ah, it looks like only the first two parts are posted with more to come tomorrow. Sorry guys. I liked the first two parts so much I posted before I realized that was all there was. 





























 It has not been established that the original speakers of IE are related genetically to the majority of today's speakers. The language is thought to have spread more from prestige influence and trade than military conquest, except in its earliest spread into the Danube Valley, where there is evidence of warfare.

So it's not like "some black people speak French" and more like "most people who speak French are unrelated to the original French nation, which we know very little about anyway since it ceased to exist 5000 years ago." 




 I don't think you can conflate "Aryan" and "white." The original people who used the word "Arya" probably were lighter-skinned, since they were from the steppes of Russia, but there are non-IE-speaking people who have light skin also, such as the Finns and Hungarians, and many darker-skinned people who speak IE languages and practice a descendant of the "Aryan" religion (most Hindus, for example.) IE is a language group, not a race. 









 "Arya" was a word in certain branches of Satem Indo-European that meant "priest," "aristocrat," or "practitioner of the correct religion or correct rituals" depending on the context. It was not used to mean "tribe" or "race." 

It is much more correct to speak of an Aryan religion that is the ancestor of both Vedic Hinduism and Zoroastrianism than an Aryan race.
 




 Cash did claim God gave him that song in a dream when he was high on Quaaludes, for what it's worth. 




 Yes, but depth like this is why people like it. 














 Here in Michigan the private schools pay for their own buses, textbooks, etc...

Are you sure? I thought that was true in my state as well until a state senator told me otherwise. I was pretty shocked that my taxes pay to bus, heat and equip religious schools.

Have coaches teach gym class. 

They usually do, but they get a separate salary for coaching, at least in most districts in my area.

Require any part of the uniform that isn't customized to be returned at the end of the year (specifically, pants).

Haha, do you know what football uniforms look like by the end of the season? Usually there are multiple uniforms per player for each season because they rip and wear out.

private schools either learn to manage their finances REALLY well, or they disappear because they can't pay the bills.

Or they get the public to foot the bill for them, without any public oversight or standardized test "accountability" that public schools have to follow. Where I live, even some public schools are run by for-profit companies and are exempt from most state regulations, including the obligation to educate special-needs and learning-disabled students. It's sick. 




  How did these right winger Italians get to be so racist? You'd be hard pressed to find a more motley assortment of racial mixing than within the Italian peninsula. 

You've answered your own question. Racial identity anxiety is known to be linked with increased racism. See the American South with its rampant underground "miscegenation" during the pre-Civil War period for another example.

Niall Ferguson covers this issue in [The War of the World](http://www.amazon.com/War-World-Twentieth-Century-Conflict-Descent/dp/1594201005) - the book can be a bit dry but the section on racial anxiety is well worth reading. 




 Prior to the Putsch, as I understand it, the Nazis were a legal party from 1925 onwards TO the Putsch.

The Beer Hall Putsch was in 1923, you've got it backwards. They were briefly banned (and Hitler was jailed under cushy conditions), but legalized again in 1925. 









 At least in my state, joining the union is voluntary. That may not be true everywhere. 




 Actually, public districts are required by law (at least in my state) to bus private students as well, and even pay for the textbooks and heating costs of private schools (except for religious textbooks.)

Sports cost more than you think - coaches are paid in most districts, uniforms, league fees and transportation are expensive, as is insurance, and "the field" in sports-crazy towns is often more like a minor-league stadium. Then there's the marching band - I know for a fact a large district near me has a marching band budget of nearly $100,000 per year.

Disputes over grades and discipline should be handled by the teacher and the student's family, and maybe the school authorities if necessary. When it comes to grade disputes, parents should be required to provide evidence that their student did not earn the grade received or that the assignment was graded unfairly.

Here I agree with you, but that's not the reality of how things work these days.
 




 Salaries of union officials come from union dues, not district budgets. 









 You're probably right about the present time, there is more violent indoctrination among Muslims. However, most Muslims - ever very conservative ones - specifically forbid attacks on civilians, Muslims or not, and if you've seen movies like "Jesus Camp" you will know that Christians have "madrassas" of their own. 









 Only if you restrict your time frame considerably. Over the long frame of history I'd say both religions are equally bloodthirsty. 




 He is an [Obscurantist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscurantist#Restricting_knowledge) - he doesn't personally believe in the religion, but he thinks it is necessary for social cohesion.

Of course the media won't use that term... it's too, well, obscure. 




 Don't forget: They can expel disruptive students. Public schools cannot (unless they have committed an actual crime, like dealing drugs or assault, and even then sometimes they are only kicked out for 6 months or a year.) 




 A lot of times, the administrators are the Creationists. That's the small-town reality. 




 I'm all for paying teachers more, but where the hell is all that money going?

Administration, sports, legal costs (districts are sued constantly when they dare to actually fail or discipline kids), busing costs (no public transportation in most areas means districts maintain huge bus fleets of their own), physical plant (there are a lot of $100M-plus HS buildings in the US with terrible academics). 




 Save money and hire an inexpensive recent grad. Look good to the school board and the negative affects aren't seen until you've hopped to a different job. This BS goes on all the time in Nursing as well which is why unions are popular in both professions. 




 Those sorts of salaries are extremely unusual for public education. They do exist in some very wealthy districts, though. 




 Yep. Given the attitudes towards education in the US, without unions teachers would be earning close to minimum wage, and the jobs would be filled without regard to qualifications or knowledge at all, and would require a political connection to get.

(This all describes how most teaching jobs were actually filled in the early 60's and before, before the union movement really got started.) 




 Yeah, I get that sensory "vagueness" also, except with visuals which are very clear. 




 I was surprised to read that there is no smell or taste in dreams because that part of the brain is shut off during REM sleep. But come to think of it, I've never experienced smell or taste in a dream.

If this is legit, it could be a very effective way to check to see if you're dreaming. So my question is - has anyone experienced smell or taste in dreams?

I'm headed to bed to test the theory myself...

**UPDATE:** Didn't work. I ate a whole box of chocolates, and I thought I was tasting them, although, upon awakening, I couldn't recall the taste. So, maybe there is no taste in dreams, but if you *think* you're tasting anyway, it's useless as a reality check. 









 The Ice Age was over 10,000 years ago. It did not end in the Middle Ages. 









 I read somewhere you would only need 50 digits of pi to compute the circumference of a circle to the nearest millimeter when it had a radius as big as the Universe, but I don't know whether or not that's true. 




 Also, I've always been curious if there is a similar series definition for pi. Wikipedia was not much help on either subject.

 no one would suggest that the bartender who sold them the alcohol is the one responsible for the death.

Actually where I live, bartenders are legally responsible, so most bars take your keys at the door and you have to breathalyze before you get them back. We have among the lowest rate of alcohol-related driving injuries in the country, so it seems to work. 




 I do agree that there would be far fewer deaths if it could be sold on the open market.

Yes, but no one would want to sell it, because there still would be deaths, and the companies that made it would be sued out of existence unless they were given Congressional Immunity like the vaccine makers.

Then you'd just be back to your shady unreliable local "entrepreneur" just like now. 




 Absolutely correct, I was just demonstrating that probabilities can be calculated over infinite quantities.  




 If there are an infinite number of both, there is no way to start the argument

Sure there is - you can do probabilities over infinite quantities. For example, in almost all randomly chosen intervals on the set of natural numbers (which is infinite), you are more likely to pick a composite than a prime number, for example. 




 Not exclusively, though Marx did use it, and it is a term exclusive to the Left as far as I know (the Right would deny the very existence of rentiers.) 




 Thanks, this is the best explanation so far. I have another question for you: Is the Uncertainty Principle a *universal* principle of any conceivable universe, that is, is it a mathematical necessity? Or, are "Newtonian" Universes mathematically possible, but it just so happens that we don't live in one?

I asked this question on reddit before but no one seemed to have a good answer. 




 Actually, it only works if there *are* infinite universes, the way I understand it.  




 I've seen that before, but his definition of "nothing" was also "quantum foam," whatever that is. Not exactly "nothing" in the philosophical sense. 




 Is there a difference though between "quantum fluctuations" - which would seem to imply a pre-existing set of laws - and actual nothingness? Because Hawking clearly states "out of nothing." 




 There's good reason to think not. For example the ["Boltzmann's Brain"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain) argument. 



















 There were rumors about where Brokmeyer had gone; it was said he was conducting a Hegel-focused kindergarten class for the Creek Indians in the wilds of the Oklahoma territory. He assured his friends he was still alive by sending intricately whittled walking sticks to their St. Louis addresses.

 Not that I necessarily believe this "shipwrecked Indians" story, but is a canoe traversal from Greenland to Iceland, thence onwards to the Faroes or Orkneys and Scotland or Norway essentially impossible? Let's assume a well-stocked Inuit canoe that had just finished a large seal or walrus hunt was blown into the open ocean by a storm. They reach Iceland and then decide this was an intervention by "the gods" or something and decide to press on. Could they conceivably have survived and reached Europe?

 The drug is pretty much a key plot element throughout the series though, so I wouldn't call it a deus ex machina. The "machina" at the end of Dune was of a more literal kind!

 Me too, I just wake up. I've never experienced this void state. 




 Nothing bizarre happened, but there were some people roaming around very much alive who are very much dead in reality (relatives, etc.) The realism was pitch-perfect and even though I knew (correctly) that it was a dream, after a while I was convinced that I had somehow entered a parallel universe.

Anyone else ever done a reverse RC and convinced themselves that they were awake when they were really dreaming? 




 Wouldn't surprise me. I think the "changing text" RC is one of the least reliable. There's all kinds of pseudoscience about how the higher reasoning functions in your brain are deactivated during dreaming so you can't read coherently or form complex thoughts. I think there's *some* truth to this (my thinking is always muddy in dreams, even in Lucid Dreams), but the reading stuff is not supported by the first-hand experiences of people on this board and others. 




 Sooo... I was a female librarian in Siberia, in the year 450 AD 




 The theory is, you can read in lucid dreams, but when you check back the same text again, it's totally different. You're supposed to be able to do the same thing with clocks. I've never been able to test this, in my lucid dreams no text or clocks ever show up. 




 While we're at it... I don't think Sacha Baron Cohen is funny at all, and a Jewish guy making such vicious fun of Muslim/Arab cultures is more than a little icky in my book.

 Don't know then. I would see a doctor to make sure you don't have any heart defects and if you don't, then I wouldn't worry about it. The heart rate charts you see at the gym are only population averages, as others have pointed out, each individual is different.

That is interesting. What prophets were believed to have come before Abraham?

 Louie is great, but it's a lot more serious and introspective than Seinfeld. The standup cut-outs are about the only thing the two shows have in common. 

Curb is I know by the same creator, but it just seems fundamentally different to me somehow. It's a creature of the reality-show age - Seinfeld, despite its postmodernism, wasn't. 





























 I have heard this theory, probably from the same TV show as the OP. The argument made by the documentary was that the symptoms of the Aztec plague did not match any known European disease. It's quite possible in my mind that, after being weakened by European diseases, native diseases that the Aztecs previously resisted spread and ended up finishing them off. 

However, the documentary focused solely on the Aztecs and not the wider downfall of the native civilizations in the new world. It is a known fact that a lot of them succumbed to smallpox and this is attested to by skeletal and DNA evidence. It was in part because this evidence was supposedly lacking with the Aztecs that the documentary made the argument that it did. They even had, if I remember correctly, some people on who claimed this disease spread back to Europe and was responsible for some of the later outbreaks of "plague" where the symptoms were quite different from those of the Black Death. 




 A lot of info is from [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Un-pharaon-republicain-Enquetes-Edition/dp/2733906143) (only in French, sorry). I don't know much about the reputation of the author as a historian, but some these sites described in the book do actually exist. 




 Several sources ranging from academic to downright dubious claim he though he had a literally divine mission to rule France, that he was outwardly a Socialist, but secretly part of a Fascist cult known as "The Hood," that he built an obelisk covered in Masonic symbols and would meditate beneath it at night, etc. etc.

It all sounds pretty crazy but unlike most other conspiracy theories this one seems to have some evidence behind it. What do you guys think?

 




 Tuition only covers part of the cost. Taxpayers pay the rest. 




 That's basically what I want to know - can these families be traced back to Roman forebears, are they barbarian families that were "Italianized" over time, or some combination of the two?

Or is their origin genuinely unknown due to the lack of historical records in that time period? 




 For the most part, we have government doing important stuff. 

Not so much anymore. So many important functions have been privatized, at this point I think you can legitimately increase the scope of government without impinging on things that the private sector does better. Study after study, for instance, have shown that private "charter" schools perform worse than traditional public schools, despite the fact that charter schools can pick and choose their students. And of course the privatization of important security and military functions has been widely documented. 




 The breathing exercises, the sitting postures and some of the simpler standing postures can be verified back 1000+ years, though not back to the time of the Vedas.

The more gymnastic stuff is a modern concoction, as was recently shown in the NY Times (link is in the top comment.) Yoga shorn of its doctrinal, religious element is also a modern phenomenon, but you probably already knew that. 




 I second that recommendation. It's quite interesting how he maps out the process by which the ultra-religious society of the Middle Ages collapsed *from within*, not because of papal corruption or the rise of science as a rival doctrine per se, but more because the natural development of its own dogma led to unbearable contradictions and conflicts.

Seeing science as a natural offshoot of religion (study God by studying His creation), that eventually turned against its ideological "parent" is quite revealing. 




 TIL. I never had any idea such places existed. I figured Tom Hanks had to go to get his license renewed just like the rest of us. Any more info on these departments? I am curious. 




 Government is not 40% of GDP in the US. Maybe in some European countries. But your wider argument is valid. 




 Government work is about being compliant with rules, fair to all stake holders, and risk minimizing. 

I see no problem with parts of the economy being run on those lines. If it is the whole economy of course, that is a recipe for stagnation. But I also think that running the whole economy on the profit principle is a recipe for destruction. Call me a mushy moderate but I think a proper balance is necessary. 




 Unfortunately the Supreme Court doesn't see it that way. In my state, taxpayers already fund all the expenses of religious schools (mainly Catholic) except teacher salaries and *religious* textbooks. Everything else: Physical maintenance, other textbooks, transportation, even heating and air conditioning costs, are borne by the public. 




 Almost all folks in the government are sincere and trying to do a good job. And they do accomplish big, complex things. But when we bid on government work, we routinely doubled the time required.

Might that not be because of the very complexity of what government does, as opposed to, say, Starbucks? 




 Maybe so, but I've lived in a number of different areas (rural, suburban, urban), and not particularly wealthy areas either - and one or two were definitely downscale, and I've never had a bad experience at either place.

Contrast that with the hundreds of frustrations that I've had with private corporations' customer service makes me look askance at people who say government is always less efficient. 









 I haven't noticed much difference between any of the three on the receiving end. When choosing shipping I just use whatever's cheaper. When shipping things I always use the post office. They are a lot more knowledgeable and helpful in my experience (and cheaper too.) 




 Debt levels really aren't that extreme in Europe, the problem is there is now a disconnect between the people making fiscal policy (nations) and the people making monetary policy (the EU). 




 I've been to the DMV.

Me too, and I've never had any problems. In fact I'm impressed with how well they handle the volume and the complexity of what they do. Same with the post office. 









 All true, I've just never thought about it in terms of energy output per unit of volume before.  














 It's any object whose existence depends on the existence of another object. For example, a physical body's existence is conditioned upon the existence of the atmosphere, the sun, etc. Since there is always change in the Universe, all conditioned objects are linked together and are thus always changing and ceasing their present form without end.

An unconditioned object, by contrast, is a metaphysically necessary object. It *must* exist, and stands outside the chain of dependence and change. Various philosophical traditions have differing views on this object. Of course in the Christian tradition it is God, the Buddhists call it Nirvana, etc. Some philosophies deny that any such object exists. 




 Technically, the rule in Buddhist doctrine is "every *conditioned object* is impermanent." Nirvana is considered the "undying element" since it is not conditioned. 




 Yep, I came here to say this. But it goes back further, to the long Tokugawa peace, when the warriors of the previous age were romanticized. Ironically, when violence came back to Japan in the Bakumatsu and the Boshin War, a lot of the combat actually took on the highly stylized "chivalric" character that the combatants *imagined* was how the Samurai fought pre-1600.

Legend became reality, and that continued right up through how the Japanese fought in WWII (courageously, but recklessly.) To take one example, Japanese fighter pilots were known to hold *live duels* with each other in their planes, sometimes even shooting each other down. This was tolerated by commanders as part of the "warrior spirit." Combat discipline was a huge problem in the Japanese Army in the pacific theater. Troops would charge when ordered not to, and would refuse to retreat to more defensible positions when ordered to do so. One cannot imagine Ieyasu or any other actual samurai-era commander condoning such foolishness.

It is interesting to read the accounts of actual samurai who fought before the Tokugawa period. There are lots of passages like "we encountered the enemy, but they outnumbered us, so we ran away," and "we were paid off so we switched sides," not so much emphasis on suicidal charges and undying devotion to the Daimyo or the like (though these things did happen occasionally - every legend has a kernel of truth.) 




 here was the Holy Roman Empire, which kings were eventually elected, which seems counterintuitive considering how the system is generally known.

Yes, but only by a handful of noble "electors," not by the general population. 




 Awesome, I didn't realize I was a government! 




 They are products of the modern media culture where everything has to be over-the-top and confrontational. Bertrand Russell they are not. However, I am not too worked up over this. The Religious Right have had their way bullying and silencing the rest of us for some time now, and if they're now getting fed a bit of their own medicine, well, turnabout is fair play. Facebook is not trivial - it's a major social forum these days, and if religious bigotry and ignorance goes unchallenged there,  that is a big deal.

However, that doesn't make Krauss someone who's actually had insights into fundamental ontology. He obviously hasn't, and to claim otherwise unfortunately weakens his political arguments, which I do by and large agree with. 




 I agree with you about Krauss, he really comes across as a charlatan. People who buy his book expecting a real answer to the Big Question are going to come away very disappointed. 




 Sure, I know some old white guys like that - blacks are "fine in their own way" but their culture is too different from ours and it would be better if we just split up into separate countries. They even say they like Malcolm X and guys like that because they also have the same beliefs (blacks and whites should be separate.)

They are just trying to make their racism seem more politically correct in my mind. But if you actually take them at their word, how would this ever be done? Can you imagine the chaos? It would be like the India-Pakistan partition times a thousand. And there are too many mixed-race people now for it to ever be practical.

Also I can guess which "country" would end up with all the economic and military resources. It wouldn't be the new "Negrostan." 




 I liked how the guy who said "you can tell I'm not Jewish just by looking at me" kinda looks like Adam Sandler. 




 Hey God, stop squeaking your chair! 




 The girls in the film have grown up now and have publicly renounced racism.  




 It makes a little more sense now, thanks. Relating it to something I know more about, it seems similar to using the Poisson distribution (where there are technically an infinite number of draws) to model a process that, while technically finite, is so large as to be practically infinite. 




 That last little bit of fat is good for you. Your body and especially brain need some fat reserves. I wouldn't freak about it as long as you feel good. 














 From what I understand, you can get it and be overwhelmed by the pleasure and snap out of it. This happened to me a few times, it wasn't a "freak out," but certainly a sense of "whoah, too much!" In my mind it's closely related  to Lacan's concept of *joissance* (overwhelming or "surplus" pleasure.) You have to "enlarge" your mind before you can handle it. 




 Yes, the brain processes complex stimuli. Where I think consciousness differs from this processing activity is in the *presentation* of the stimuli as an immediate whole.

I would say that "the awareness that one exists" as a "self" is subjectivity, or at least the beginnings of it, not consciousness. I would say consciousness precedes self-awareness.  




 I think that better defines subjectivity rather than consciousness. Consciousness seems to be immediate apprehension of a complex set of stimuli, not a process.  














 That's not a glitch, that's a peek at the assembly code. 




 You are defining consciousness as a disconnect between two elements, one of which is already consciousness. 




 He might have, but it is far less likely. Choice of venue is important. Attacking an institution where one studied or was employed instead of random civilians is psychologically significant.  




 consciousness is merely a disconnect between the automatic operations and the conscious operations of the brain.

Not trying to pick on you, but that contradictory sentence right at the beginning of your post shows just how hard it is to get at any coherent idea of consciousness. 




 My friend once had a dream where she was given a phone number *and address* by the "reincarnation" of a friend of hers who had died (yikes...) 

To my eternal frustration, she never called and soon forgot the number!! 




 The immigration part is what's illegal. And $250/month would be well under minimum wage. Still doesn't stop a lot of people from trying. 




 The link, again, does not lead to a workplace or school shooting. Also:

as of April 2008 he was unemployed and had to face severe financial difficulties.

which sort of goes with what I have been saying.  




 The higher incidence being at least partly related to guns was part of my original point (and the author's). Smith was not a school/workplace shooter.

If Goh had stayed in Korea he probably would have committed suicide without harming others, as that is how social antagonism often plays out in that country. 




 They have been shown to have a much higher incidence in the US than in other countries, and for different motivations, that is, they are almost never *overtly* political like the recent killings in Norway and France were.

Of course Goh was a sociopath, but you can't ignore the culture either. His most likely inborn mental illness was exacerbated by his cultural context, whereas other contexts would have been more likely to ameliorate it.  




 Night-vision goggles have infrared light emitters that aren't supposed to be seen with normal vision. Given the amount of drug trafficking and associated military/police activity in Texas, I don't think this was an alien. It's not clear to me from the video what the figure's distance is and if it was downhill or not. 

Also, Brad Steiger is not an "image expert," he is an author and a journalist.  




 There was a clear motive of self-interest - revenge and regaining lost honor. Perhaps the oldest motivation for violence and killing that exists. Focusing on the "irrational" aspects of this case denies the strong forces of cultural determination that the author of the article pointed out. The workplace/school shooting is as much a product of modern culture as the duel was of the 18th Century and the lynching in the 19th. 




 True, but what you said was such mass violence isn't influenced by poverty. I think that's incorrect and the African bush wars are a very good example. 




 That's a US Army soldier wearing night-vision goggles. I don't see where it appears "gigantic" at all.  




 I disagree, especially when the "war" is more of a chaotic mass looting and killing for no reason. The media interprets events in Africa through the lens of "Genocide," one tribe trying to wipe out another. What goes unreported is how often these forces *attack their own side*. 




 Actually in places like Africa, spree killings are so common, they're almost an institution. Ever hear of a brush war? 














 I don't think it was a protest - at least a conscious one - but I do think it was an economic decision. People with low economic status have "less to lose" by such acts and thus do not have as strong a motivation to repress violent urges as others. 




 250 million guns aren't connected to our political culture? As for poverty, that is definitely both a cause and an effect of political culture. I don't see how population really has much to do with it. If you wanted a similar unit of comparison you could use the European Union which has 300 million plus population as well. 




 Would you deny that there is a link in general between the very high levels of violence in America as opposed to other industrialized countries and the political culture in the US? Because if you admit that link I think you would have to admit the link between mass killings and the culture as a special case thereof. 




 You should have read that link a little more carefully:

Not included are school massacres, workplace killings, hate crimes or familicides, which form their own categories.

Each culture has its own version of the "rampage" or the "beserker" which says something about the stresses of that particular culture. In America the workplace and school shootings are more common - in Europe and Africa, overtly political rampages are more common. Again, don't discount that book before you read it. 




 You should read the author's book "Going Postal." This is by no means an isolated incident. It is part of a repeated and widespread sociological pattern. That Goh had problems beyond what society can be blamed for is not the point. The point is instead of ameliorating or controlling those problems, Goh's social context exacerbated them until he exploded. He is the latest in a long list of workplace and school shooters. 




 Every society has its psychopaths, but how that psychosis manifests does say something about the society. The 9/11 attackers did *say something* about Muslim society - even though of course they didn't represent the views of most Muslims. Anders Brevik's killing spree did *say something* about the tradition of White Nationalism and Nazi sympathy in the Nordic countries, even though most Norwegians abhor his views, etc.

Likewise, Goh's shootings do *say something* about the pervasive culture of economic scams and hypocritical religion in the US, even though there is of course much more to the US than scams and fundamentalist hucksters. 



















 [Here's an interview with Shostak](http://www.astrobio.net/debate/3036/technology-worlds) where he goes more in-depth and mentions Seyfert galaxies. 




 The two top candidates for these kinds of structure are Hoag's Object (a strange galaxy where stars have been separated by type - no one knows how), and Seyfert Galaxies - badly disturbed galaxies that some have speculated are "industrial accidents" left behind by Type III civilizations.

The artificial nature of these structures is by no means proven, but some reputable astronomers have speculated in that direction. 




 There is a very long taboo in a lot of Buddhist groups about claiming attainments, because it would start endless arguments about who was really Enlightened, etc. This kind of attitude was learned through hard experience. On the other hand, being super-mysterious about it has its disadvantages as well. 




 Sounds like you have Sleep Paralysis. Sufferers often report experiencing an evil presence in the room with them, often slowly coming towards them. It's something to do with the brain's self/other perception going haywire.

If you don't mind me asking, what's so terrifying about this "ghost"? It can't be appearance, since you describe it as a cartoonish "bed-sheet ghost." 




 No, but sometimes a dog is following me and I think I've dropped my keys 




 Imagining exercise might cue the body to think that exercising is immanent, cuing increased heart rate, etc., just like imagining food can cause salivation. But yeah, I'd like to see a source too. It seems like that would be too weak of an effect to result in any noticeable weight loss. I could see where an ill-controlled study that didn't monitor subjects' eating habits might see that effect - if you imagine exercise every night you might become more health-conscious and change your eating habits. 




 Agreed. Part of the problem is that "white" has always been defined negatively, that is, a "white" person was just someone who didn't fit into one of the more identifiable racial or ethnic groups. Might as well just call us "blank" people.

Another problem is that the "white" population in the US came from so many different European cultures that they really don't have that much of a common cultural background at all. Just like the Indian in the video who couldn't explain his culture as anything more than "dancing around a totem pole and stuff," what is "white" culture to the average American today, that is, culture that only "white" people can participate in and enjoy? NASCAR and Country Music? Hardly worth defending against some other culture or subculture that may be more appealing. 




 Depends when you date the beginning of the Civil War. 




 The U.S. and Canada got away with it.

And the British Empire. Read the book "The Victorian Holocaust." They killed more people in India alone than Hitler did in all the places he conquered. Of course, they had a lot longer to get the killing done. Mainly they used deliberate starvation like Stalin, but they weren't above gassing people either (Churchill suggested that the Kurds should be eliminated by gassing their villages- Saddam wasn't the one to think of that first.) 




 Quite eye-opening. The dialectic of White Nationalism eventually leads the thoughtful racist to sympathize with the Indians (!), and equate his own ancestors with today's globalists. 




 Google "Nazi Cultural Revolution." I think I'm remembering a proper book when it was just a review I read of "Werewolf!" plus some chat-board discussions.  

They're interesting nonetheless and would certainly make a great novel should someone choose to write one. Heck, I'll get us started:

Basically, Goebbels and the other surviving Nazis (with an ailing and increasingly demented Hitler in tow) carry out the "Alpine Redoubt" plan they were considering in 1945, and manage to spark a war between the US and the Soviets using false-flag attacks with the connivance of Patton and Churchill (both of whom considered an immediate attack on the Soviets in real life.) While the two former allies pummel each other, the Nazi Party is reconstructed along ultra-radical lines in rural Bavaria and Austria, paralleling Mao's Long March. The Party is toughened up, and (like Mao's forces), realizes that the total collapse of civilization is not enough to stop a determined group of radicals from seizing power. In fact, it rather helps things along.

Shadowy bankers from Switzerland cross the border into Nazi-held territory with gold and other resources for re-armament. Remnants of the Italian, Vichy French, and other fascists also make their way across the high passes of the Alps and join up with the Waffen SS. Ironically, the SS is now "multicultural" (this was happening to some degree in real life before the end of the war - they even had a Muslim battalion!). Some "adjustment" of racial views take place - success in battle is now evidence enough that you must have "Aryan" ancestry somewhere (Jews still need not apply, of course.)

In the chaos of the US-Soviet war, the Nazis manage to re-take a lot of their former territory and become a "Third Force" that neither the US or the Russians want to piss off for fear of putting the Nazis in the opposing camp. When peace finally arrives in late 1947 (Truman has threatened to nuke Moscow with his new long-range bombers), the Nazi regime is re-entrenched and there is no trust left among the former allies to take it down. Cynical politicians on both sides also see the advantage of a Central European "buffer state" between the American and Soviet Empires to keep border tensions down. The Holocaust is known about, but it is lost in the sea of the mass slaughter of an expanded and elongated World War II.

Hitler was already quite sick in 1945 and dies by 1950, succeeded by a triumvirate of Goering (who is also sickly and morbidly obese by this point), Bormann and Goebbels. Himmler defected to Sweden when all seemed lost in 1945 (his actual plan in real life) and is now a Trotsky-like figure. By the 1960's, the Reich has become a bizarre cross of Switzerland and North Korea, committed to neutrality but also ruled by a totalitarian political party which is armed to the teeth with some of the most advanced weaponry in the world.

By this point, Goebbels, always the master propagandist and politician, has pushed aside Bormann. Goering died in 1955, a 500-lb. monster, surrounded by harem girls and plundered art. Goebbels was always on the left-wing of the Party and wants to revive the "Socialist" in National Socialism. However, he faces strong opposition from conservative Christians and business interests who are now doing a booming trade with both the US and Soviet spheres. 

However, Goebbels has a potent weapon: A new generation of "Aryans," raised by the Hitler Youth and the "Lebensborn" movement. These cadres, now come of age, assail the conservatives and try to revive the dream of world conquest and the Master Race. They protest at Universities and party conventions, carrying their "little black books" - abridged copies of *Mein Kampf* of course. They occupy Albert Speer's grand buildings in Berlin and demand the downfall of the "bourgeois  Junkers" and the "foreign elements" within the Waffen SS. The rest of the world grows nervous that World War III is about to begin...

take it from there!

 




 I haven't read that but I did read "Young Stalin" by the same author. It actually prompted my question as it had a number of incidents of Stalin acting in a very reckless manner that could be suggestive of psychosis or clinical paranoia. 




 Yes, I think that's where I heard it too. Great show. 




 I've heard this story too. Apparently this happened back in Georgia. He was with some fellow Bolsheviks and he wanted to prove his toughness and mercilessness so he killed the animal (in the version I heard, he strangled it.) I'm not sure how much validity this story has or where I heard it. 




 Yes, I know he did a lot of that early on in his rule. I'm more thinking of later on, the Great Terror and later, all the people who died shouting "long live Stalin!" and actually meant it. Did Stalin think those people had secretly betrayed him (clinical paranoia), or was he killing people he knew to be loyal for some other reason? 




 Don't forget the "Blues," the supporters of the Provisional Government! 




 Interesting question. I may take heat for this, but there are a lot of similarities between Hitler's expansion towards the East and the genocide of the Native Americans in the US. Indeed Hitler thought of the two as similar and used that to morally justify his invasions. See the book *The Wages of Destruction* for a good discussion of this.

Science in Nazi Germany was highly politicized. Anyone who didn't get on the mythical "Aryan" bandwagon was sacked or worse. In a scenario where Hitler "won" the war - not necessarily conquer the world, just survive as a regime into the 1950's or 60's, I don't see this really changing.

Most people who have thought through "Alternate Histories" about a postwar Nazi regime see the main threat coming from even more radical Nazis - the pagan/mystical SS clashing with the more Christian "preserve traditional German values" crowd. There was a great book a while back, can't remember the title, that was set during a Nazi "Cultural Revolution" during the 60's where radical ultra-Aryan students "assaulted the party" for its conservatism under the direction of a new Fuhrer who took over after Hitler's death.

In short, no, I think the Nazi ideology was too extreme to ever moderate like the American "manifest destiny" ideology eventually did. Instead it would probably have turned inward on itself and collapsed in a series of purges and crazy attempts to resurrect Atlantis (Thule) or genetically engineer Aryan supermen or some such craziness. 



















 According to something I saw on TV, you can do this in Baltimore just by asking people to say the name of the city! Not sure how accurate or scientific this is however.

 Numbers like 24, 60 and 360 are useful because they have lots of factors. That is, there are lots of ways to subdivide them without remainder. That is one reason these numbers show up a lot in calculating everyday things like time and angle.

 If you are considering math grad school, you will probably see plenty more of both. Are you more of an algebra/stats person or a geometry/physics person? 



















 I had this practice described to me though I haven't tried it myself. Basically, your read alternating chapters of works from opposing points of view (materialism vs. dualism, right-wing vs. left-wing politics, etc.). 

This supposedly avoids the effect of reading the books in sequence (first one and then the other) and being convinced either by the first or the last one you read, depending on your disposition.

Also you are supposed to see hidden connections, points of agreement or common flaws that the two arguments share. 









 Not for Central Banks, there it's the opposite.  









 I am more thinking, long-term, the team worst off in this new system is the one that shares a division with the Yankees. 









 Until very recently it was a good move as the pay is often a lot better. There is a "special needs" teacher at our district who is assigned to just a single student. The teacher's sole job is to follow this student around all day, and slap her hand back when she tries to touch things/people. Oh, and a bit of paperwork every 6 months. She makes more than twice the salary of a regular teacher.

However, if our state follows NY and some bureaucrat decides that this student needs to take the state standardized tests, this teacher is out of a job.  




 I go out of the way to use examples that involve pop culture, drugs, booze, speak the same way as my students

Advice from someone who's been on the job a bit longer than you have, perhaps: There is nothing more uncool than the "cool teacher." This does not earn you respect from the students.

 A friend of mine had a dream like this: She dreamed that a friend of hers - who had actually died in real life at 16 - appeared and told her she had been reborn as a baby in Italy, and gave the name of the town and the street address and everything.

Now I don't believe in reincarnation or anything, but I would have at least looked up that address when I woke up! My friend however, just wrote it off as a "weird dream" and never looked up the address. She said she remembered it for some time, but by the time she told me about the dream, she had forgotten everything about it except that it was somewhere in Italy. 




 Isn't this illegal in the US? I remember a similar site being shut down last year because "peer-to-peer" lending violated American banking regulations. Have they found a way around this? 



















 Very good explanation. Thanks! 




 Interesting, I am not really familiar with model theory. I am confused as to how if you only have the symbols 0,1,+,x,, how you can get anything other than whole numbers anyway. 

Even if you add Z to that list, I assume it is a Boolean function of some kind, telling you if a number is an integer or not? Wouldn't any number still come out to be an integer if you only have 0, 1,+ and * to work with to make other numbers? (I am assuming you mean "x" to be multiply, not a variable name.) 




 Thanks for the reply. I understood the first paragraph but kind of lost you in the second. I've been through Analysis but it's been a while. Maybe time to dust off the old notes... 







































 Some of it is semantics - the law differs from country to country. In the US if you had like some kind of hippie love nest (no offense intended) it would be easier to organize it under corporate law than civil union law. In fact there are communes in California that are so incorporated. 




 A partnership is a contract, usually between two people - it can be a few more - about how to operate a business (or, in this hypothetical case, a household.) More people involve forming a corporation, where stock is issued and there are more set rules, a board of directors, etc. 




 They took a lot of the outer stone casing of the pyramids - they might have pilfered some of the larger building stones here and there, but not very many. At the time the pyramids were built a canal ran to the site at Giza and the course of the Nile was a good deal closer to the site than in the middle ages, making stone transport a good deal easier. 




 Yes, but your relationship with more than one other person is fundamentally corporate, not a partnership (I'm speaking in technical legal terms, not emotional ones.) 




 True... I might fall into that category at times. I consider Lacan a great philosopher but by no means perfect and he sometimes descended to charlatanism - a trait he shared with Freud... 




 I tried looking online, couldn't find them either. I saw them on a TV documentary on the pyramids a while back - BBC probably, but I can't remember the exact name. You might want to try to contact someone who's an expert on that time period in Egyptian history, probably a professor in Middle Eastern History, or, since they were European engravings, European cultural or art history. 




 In the engraving I saw (on TV admittedly), it looked like the sand came halfway up the side of the pyramid.  




 It does, but polyamory could be covered under corporate law (strange as that sounds!) 




 The "stolen lunch money" theory of Roman expansion is sadly under-appreciated.  




 Yes, that is how it's argued but the other purpose is there as well, people just don't like to talk about it. 




 I don't really see the connection. Quasars are phenomena of the early universe. The Quasar Period was long before any sort of life - at least life as we know it - could have evolved. There are no Quasar-like objects in nearby spacetime. 




 Since forever. The adjudicated mentally retarded and some other classes of adjudicated mentally ill are considered legal minors and are not allowed to wed. You may agree or disagree with this but it is the law most places. These are state and not federal laws though. 




 I support Universal Civil Unions and getting government out of the marriage business altogether. Every adult should be able to designate one other person as their legal "civil partner," which might be their marriage partner, or a sibling, or a best friend.

This makes any sort of gay vs. incest debate irrelevant and lets the State get back to more important business (hopefully.) 




 There are engravings from the Renaissance that show the Great Pyramid about half-buried in a sand-drift. No, nothing in orthodox Christianity or Islam says that biblical figures built the pyramids, but in demotic folk religion this belief was common. You will hear it from taxi drivers in Egypt to this day. 

As for wanting to make a bigger structure, as I said, it was thought that the pyramids were the work of legendary figures so I doubt anyone thought it was possible. The Ptolemaic Dynasty in Egypt did brag that the Great Lighthouse was a successor to the pyramids. At 450 feet tall it was almost as tall as the Great Pyramid though of course its volume was far less. 




 True. It did sound like she sent her daughter to a "progressive" school, not a traditional upper-crust or religious private school. 

There used to be progressive public schools as well in some areas, but the standardized testing era put an end to most of them. 




 I know that for some of the time period in question a good deal of the pyramids were obscured in sand drifts. 

However, it's wrong to suggest that people in previous times were not impressed by the pyramids. There were a good deal of legends about them, such as that they were built by biblical figures (usually Aaron, Moses or Mohammed), and that they could cure ailments. 

As the pyramids were seen as the creations of legendary figures, not ordinary men, their vast size was somewhat taken for granted. In that sense people in those times might have been less impressed than modern people as to the immensity of the achievement. 




 As someone who teaches in one of those "disasters" I can tell you the admin is even more scared of lawsuits because they have no money. As soon as a lawyer shows up we roll over and give the parents whatever they want, no matter how ridiculous.

And in most of the country, the church school is the only private school option. Seeing as we both seem to have the same opinion of church schools, you may want to consider where all those kids will go if you succeed in demolishing the "government" schools. 




 Keep in mind not all Lacanians are Zizek fans. 




 You will find a lot of private schools with endowments that don't really care what parents think - they will always have a line out the door for the snoot factor.

Then there's church-funded schools which also have powerful constituencies that are often indifferent to parent needs. 

In my experience public schools are often over-sensitive to parent demands because of a fear of lawsuits or a nasty story on the local news. 




 She thinks the bullying and political correctness will be less in a private school? Maybe so, but I doubt it. 




 The golden number is aesthetically pleasing to humans, so it makes sense that a building would be designed that way even if the mathematics behind it wasn't known. I don't know about the meter stuff but they definitely degenerated into "History" Channel tabloid nonsense at the end so I wouldn't give it much credibility. 









 this is not about Aliens, or any mystical lines and such.

Positing an advanced ancient civilization that had modern or even super-modern technology levels is just as much of a stretch. 

I'm not familiar with all the stuff in this movie, but the pi stuff at least was explaining long ago: the Egyptians used circular measuring tools instead of rulers, so pi shows up "naturally" in their structures. 









 There's a house where I used to live that was half-finished by one of those remodeling shows. For some reason the producers cancelled the episode that family was going to be in and they just abandoned the place and left the family homeless. It was all over the local news and papers and there was fundraising for the family. I don't know whatever became of it because I moved around that time.

 Apparently it's realizing how the dual and non-dual aspects of reality arise from each other, but I am no expert on such subtle states! 




 If this is the ultimate realization, I'm not interested. Suffering seems pleasurable compared to the spiritual lobotomy this guy apparently suffered. 

Others say the non-dual experience is important but it is not the final experience. That seems more likely - and more like a goal worth attaining. 




 There was a biology professor who did a study that concluded there simply isn't enough nutrition in the NW forests to support a population of large primates unless they came down to the salmon runs, in which case they certainly would have been clearly documented already.

Can't find a link to the study I think it was on a documentary where I heard this professor speaking. University of Washington maybe? If anyone has more info please post. 




 Awesome response, thanks. Very thorough. 




 I know the feeling. Just beware that when you meditate sometimes small sensations can seem very amplified because your mind is quiet. I am not sure if chakras are "real" or not in a spiritual sense but I have been disappointed by these experiences in the long run - they seem to be leading to something great then it just fades. 

On the other hand some other mediators report quite impressive things that happen after the whole chakra/kundalini experience. I guess what I'm saying is don't get your hopes too high just yet but don't dismiss it either. 




 Nice, but beware of sensations that are just fabrications of the mind. I have these experiences every now and then as well but don't assume they can be used for healing.

 Right, but that was still a bunch of the current plates stuck together. My question was do the plates themselves change over time, not just their positions on the Earth. 




 I know the oceanic plates get subducted and new ones form, but are the continental plates permanent? Can they split apart, merge, or be subducted as well?  




 No, the "shocking" part was apparently that Voltaire was against metaphysics and that Godel believed (in his delusional period) that there was a conspiracy to hide these works of Leibniz. 




 There was interesting stuff in this video, but I feel I have to downvote because:

1.) There was nothing "shocking" in the video whatsoever.

2.) It veered into conspiracy theory nonsense and is apparently part of a huge video series on the "secret history" of the Earth

3.) Ouch, the music!

 Didn't he ever consider that the road atlas in Episode 1 was arranged alphabetically? That would be a much more common-sense reason for an obscure town starting with "Ab..." to be the first entry. 




 The "absolutist relativism" that is so often attributed to Postmodernists can be easily destroyed as a coherent concept by any halfway with-it college freshman, and already has been many times of course.

However, you'd be hard-pressed to find an actual "Postmodern" philosopher who actually held or holds such an extreme position, it's more of a straw-man position ascribed to these philosophers by their opponents. 

Part of the problem is there was never a coherent philosophical school called "Postmodernism," no Manifesto with bullet points nailing down specific beliefs, or anything like that, because after all, what could be more anti-Postmodern than a Manifesto? 

So therefore it's hard to point to any ideas that are specifically "Postmodern" in nature. It is/was more of a mood of epistemological skepticism and a style of argumentation than a defined set of positions. 

 




 From what i've been told, taxes are unreal in America. What is all that tax money going towards?

 None of the people on trial were in the documentary. In fact the documentary didn't even mention Birmingham. The BBC was baffled not only that the judge banned the doc but banned them from even saying why or who had banned it. That's downright Orwellian. 

Edit: And for people who were saying it was only banned until the trial ended, there have been 10-year-plus trials in the past, and we have a government in the US that invented the infinite, undeclared war in order to bypass the Constitution, I can easily see the UK government inventing never-ending trials in order to do the same.

 The Federalist Papers (Anti-Federalist Writings preferred)

Haha, was this in there to see if anyone was paying attention? Or do you have a serious reason for recommending it? 




 Yikes, I will never call myself "depressed" again after reading that. 




 Google "Hitler's Second Book" 




 Correct, but the conventional wisdom is that he was trying to contact those in the government who had been pro-German before the war and would be most open to a peace treaty. Besides any peace treaty between Britain and Hitler would be a de facto alliance since if Hitler could have purchased goods or obtained loans from the vast British empire, his chances of winning the war would have been greatly enhanced. 




 There are several good sources in the Rudolph Hess wikipedia article under "motives for trip" - and one horrible one, a conspiracy theory book published by "Ancient Aliens" type people who claimed the Hess who flew to Britain was a body double  and the real Hess stayed in Germany (!!).

Of course there is also Hess's own statement (under a pseudonym after landing) that he was a friend of the [Duke of Hamilton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Douglas-Hamilton,_14th_Duke_of_Hamilton#World_War_II.2C_the_Hess_Affair.2C_and_after), and later on that the purpose of his flight was to negotiate a secret peace treaty. Hitler certainly believed that's what Hess was up to and ordered him shot on sight if he returned to Germany (although he may have changed his mind in the highly unlikely even that he returned with a treaty in hand!) 




 I have noticed this too. However, it is not universal. The fans in my place now go 0 1 2 3 0 (there are two off settings.)  




 Yes, in fact he wanted an alliance with Britain against the US, where he thought the Aryan blood had been too corrupted by Jews, "Negroes," and other inferior types. And also he thought that two "Continental" powers would always be antagonistic, whereas a "Continental" and a "Maritime" power could work together. He saw both Germany and the US as continental but the British Empire as Maritime. All this and more bonkers geopolitics can be found in [Hitler's second book](http://www.amazon.com/Hitlers-Second-Book-Unpublished-Sequel/dp/1929631618/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1342462243 sr=8-1 keywords=hitler%27s+second+book) as well as some passages in the original Mein Kampf.

Some people in Britain, by the way, thought about an alliance with Hitler. It wasn't just a one-sided love affair. How many people in Britain and how much influence they had in the country is a matter of debate, but Rudolf Hess was almost certainly trying to contact these elements when he flew to the UK in 1941. 




 What is the distinction between Ur and Sumeria? 









 Quite right, but you would not expect the kind of correlation that Paulides is claiming. You might expect to find several kids who took their clothes off, and several others who hiked great distances, and several others who couldn't remember what happened to them. What you wouldn't expect to find are clusters where *all* of these things happened to multiple subjects without there being a causative etiology (which is a fancy way of saying, something other than random "patterns" in the data.) 














 Actually, Paulides is a bigfoot investigator, and probably first heard about these cases while interviewing park rangers about bigfoot. He tries hard to keep the areas of his life separate because he doesn't want to be the "crazy bigfoot guy" who also does missing-persons cases, but his Amazon page gives him away.

Still, the pattern of cases is no myth and they can be verified in local newspapers and police reports. They could use an advocate with better credibility than Paulides. He is ex-law enforcement but whether it's fair or not, his involvement with bigfoot will make many people immediately discount his other work which is unfortunate. 




 Right, but that 1/3 was down from nearly 90% before the Civil War. 









 A hundred years ago, a large percentage of women were homemakers.

"homemaking" was a hard job and often included much child care and farmwork. Yes, people still have kids today, but caring for nine or ten as compared to one or two is quite different. Today hardly anyone cares for nine or ten kids without it being an employed position (teacher, child care center worker, etc.) I would not count the housewives of the 19th century as being "unemployed" in the modern sense. 




 Sort of correct. The tractor and mechanical thresher did force millions of farm workers off the land. They moved to the cities though and found industrial work in the factories which were booming, but when the 1930's depression hit they could not just "go back to the farms" like city-dwellers had done in previous downturns. That's when the starvation and homelessness started.

It's interesting to read about the Great Depression in France where smallholdings, gov't policy and social customs limited farm automation. The Depression was less severe in France (though still bad) because many laid-off workers simply went back to the family farm. 




 I assume we're not planning on digging mass graves

Don't assume so quickly. I've been reading Ben Franklin's accounts of his trips to England. He had conversations with the upper class where they openly discussed how to start a big war to get rid of the excess population. Eventually they decided (economically) forced emigration to North America and later (legally) forced emigration to Australia were better options, but they considered mass graves. I'm not so sure things are too different today. 




 It doesn't really matter. If the LLC you created defaults on the mortgage, the lenders still repossess the house. Besides most mortgage lenders use standardized contracts and I doubt they would lend to an LLC.

Someone more experienced in these matters, feel free to correct me though. 




 No, the one guy specifically said it had aired on PBS and that "you could watch it" (presumably online.) The two guys looked kind of weird themselves and I was too chicken to butt in to their conversation! 














 It was about a woman who had kept a dead Christmas tree in her house since 1993, decorations and all, and documented its decomposition over time. She lost friends over the "creepiness" of the tree, but wouldn't give it up. According to what I overheard, she even got the tree declared an "artistic landmark" by "the city" and exempted from laws which would have made her throw it out. (not sure which city, but it could be NYC or Philly.) Supposedly it aired on PBS - though maybe only locally.

Has anyone heard of this documentary, and if so, is it available online? I tried asking r/documentaries. Two people had seen it, one thought he remembered the title as "Mad City Tannenbaum," but I couldn't find any reference to that title online. The other could not remember the title.

Further details: The two people talking knew this woman personally, and she seemed to have some mental problems but also some political influence. 




 That's illegal two different ways (stock manipulation and libel), but as long as you don't broadcast your plans on the Internet, sounds like a good scheme... 




 Good point. However it seems like most of the people on here are into sociology or social psychology, not the interpretation of dreams. I think you would find more experts over there. 




 Probably represents the subconscious or something like that. Try r/psychology instead. 









 You're the Zombie Lenin, get on that job. 




 Why did they keep making payments on their car? It's not like the repo man was going to come knocking on their door.

If you stop making car payments, the lender gives your license plate number to the police. Especially with the increasing numbers of police departments with automatic plate-scanners mounted on their cruisers, you will probably be found.

Edit: Oh, and I forgot, it is also possible that you will be charged with stealing the car. In your car loan it says if you can't make the payments you must immediately surrender the vehicle. Technically, the bank owns the car until you make the last payment. Trust me, stopping car payments is not a good idea. Better to sell the car and get something cheaper if possible. 




 There were really two economies in colonial America, one in the South and in Latin America that was more like the old world with huge landholdings and slavery/serfdom. The other was in the North and was really anomalous in world history at least since the early Roman expansion in that ordinary people could and did become landholders, often large landholders.

You can look at the political map of the US in recent elections to see that this divide is still with us to some extent. 




 was simply the marketplace trying its best to shrink the amount of people competing for work in a post-industrial setting?

more the government than the marketplace, but yes. The other main "method of attack" on this economic dislocation was to create "perceived needs" for goods that people "didn't know they wanted." This is more of a marketplace function.

What happens in 100 years if only 10 percent of the planet needs to be employed to adequately fill the market's labor uses?

Ask your Uncle Karl. Also, there will probably be an effort to bring the population down by discouraging children except among the "chosen."

 I ask this because the other day I walked into a restaurant with my girlfriend. The maitre d' station was unmanned and beyond it was just a stairway leading down underground. We knew the place was open because I could hear rock music and people talking plus normal restaurant sounds (plates, glasses, etc.) coming from downstairs. 

But... there was creepy clown stuff everywhere on the walls in the entranceway and leading down the stairwell. I could also see the edge of a jukebox downstairs and this frightened me too for some reason. I am not afraid of clowns in the least and neither is the gf but something told us to get the hell out of there and we did. 

We had to walk blocks and blocks to find another restaurant and now I feel somewhat embarrassed at being such a chicken and running away from a restaurant because of clown stuff on the walls. By the menu outside it looked like they had good food and beer too. 

On the other hand, we might have just barely avoided being chopped to pieces by killer clowns. It got me to thinking, who here has had the strong instinct to leave a place for no specific reason but ignored that instinct? What happened then (good or bad)?   




 Can't find anything by that or any similar name. Do you remember when or where you saw it? 




 This sounds more like the legendary origin of the [Hata Clan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hata_clan) as opposed to the Yamato (Imperial line.). They were supposedly descended from the Qin Emperor who did indeed have an obsession with immortality. Unlike today's obession with "purity," many Japanese clans of the early historical periods proudly claimed (or invented) foreign lineage to make themselves seem more prestigious. 




 I've always had a soft spot for the Polynesian theory but I must admit most of the recent evidence is against it.

I still think there's a Polynesian influence on Japanese architecture - perhaps spread by merchants which became a prestige form - and on the pronunciation if not the underlying grammar and root syllables of the language. I can't prove any of this, it's just a semi-educated hunch. I used to think Japanese was most likely an Altaic-Polynesian trade creole but this seems increasingly unlikely, especially with the discovery of proto-Japanese forms in Korea. 




 I think it's pretty well-established that the Imperial line originated with a well-organized and warlike tribe in the Yamato region around 300 AD. Sure, they probably had ancestors on the Korean peninsula 1,500 years before that, but it wasn't like they were a "foreign" dynasty *recently* imported from Korea, a la the Normans in England. 




 Possibly a sonic boom caused by a micro-meteorite? Just a guess. Metallic grinding noise could have been the rock disintegrating by atmospheric friction.

 Derivation of the Poisson Distribution formula and its statistics. I have to re-memorize it every year in case a student asks to see it, which someone does about half the time. 




 Cool, I've never heard of these before. Thanks. 




 IIRC, 90% is the upper limit for Korean ancestry of the modern Japanese, not the lower limit. Estimates range from 60-90%, with the remainder being "Jomon" in origin. 




 Well, if the Japanese are Altaic in some distant respect, the Altaic languages were thought to originate in Siberia, as were the Amerindian languagues. It's quite a stretch though to connect the two, other than through some very basic elements such as Shamanism which is widespread throughout all of E. Asia and the New World. 




 would be a strong indication that a people migrated in from that neighbor.

*Some* people, yes, but not necessarily a large number that would change the genetic character of a population. Material cultures have been known to spread in pre-history without corresponding changes in the physical characteristics of a population. Interestingly, there are sometimes small numbers of distinct "foreigner" burials - probably remains of the merchants or outcasts who spread the material culture. I'm not sure if this is the case in Japan or not. I know this phenomenon is documented in prehistoric Britain and elsewhere in Europe.

The culture you're thinking of is the Jomon. Studies I've seen have said that modern Japanese ancestors are anywhere from 10-40% Jomon, with the remainder being Korean in origin. 




 No, we eat far less. I remember reading that the average farm laborer in Ireland the 19th century consumed up to 10,000 calories per day. This was part of the reason so much of the population was rural: Farmers ate a good deal of the calories they produced, leaving much less of a surplus than today. 




 you can trace the migration of Koreans into Japan from the spread of cultivated chestnut trees and later through the introduction of different rice strains 

A common misconception. The spread of a material culture does not always imply the spread of large numbers of immigrant peoples. The same rice culture spread from China to Korea, and the Chinese and Koreans are genetically distinct.

There is a strong argument to be made that the Japanese and Koreans are closely related, but not based on the sort of evidence you site.  




 This is because the author knows nothing of America below the elite 1%.

quite unlike their saw-handling knife-juggling fire-eating American redneck counterparts, for many of whom a greasy fast-food burger and a beating at the hands of a semi-drunk parent before bed will comprise the best coddling they can hope for. 

the hypocrisy, it burns... 









 Assuming you're serious... I'm sure if you traveled back in time you would find that Spartans had a greater pain tolerance than other Greeks, but that would be a cultural difference, not genetic. Probably the same story with the Japanese. They are certainly culturally and linguistically unique, but genetically they don't form a separate population. 

As for the intestines stuff, I've never head this before, but it sounds dubious. Move to Denver and in a decade you'll have larger lungs. Doesn't make Colorodans a special race of being. 




 True. Americans of recent generations aren't really used to hearing foreign languages spoken so commonly. There's a sort of instinctive paranoid reaction of "oh, I'll bet they're talking about us." Growing up in a rural area I found this attitude a lot. If an immigrant was seen to be making an effort to speak and learn English, he was accepted a lot faster than if he was seen in public speaking his native language. 









 Not to mention he was quite racist even compared to the standards of his own time, which is saying something. "Mediterranean" people (like, Italians) disgusted him and of course he was terrified of "Negroes." A lot of this comes out in his writing where this xenophobia gets sublimated into actual "alien" creatures from other worlds.  




 Presumably, with a better economy relative to other rich nations at that point, the US will be able to attract still more immigrants. 




 Yep. I read an opinion somewhere that really stuck with me: A person is only a true, ideological "racist" if he would rather have a family of hillbillies for a neighbor than, say, Colin Powell. Few people these days would make that trade. 




 Tried that, didn't work. I'm starting to think this woman merely claimed she had a documentary made... on the other hand someone on here remembers seeing it (he thinks). Grr... 




 That's one of the things they were talking about, that it still had electric decorations on it and they were afraid it would catch on fire. I got from the gist of the conversation that the woman in the documentary is more than a little crazy. 














 I'm thinking specifically of four bubbles:

Japan in the late 80's.

The US in the mid-2000's.

Spain in the late 2000's.

(Perhaps) China currently.

 Actually I found downloading the update fixed the glitchiness netflix had been plagued with recently, and it isn't doing any of these things on my wii. Which version wii do you have? 




 I agree. I personally don't believe that AP is "real" as in scientifically real (it would seem so easy to get hard evidence if it was - just put random words on a piece of paper inside a locked room or something), but nevertheless it is "real" in the realm of experience, and I find it fascinating.

Personally I think AP is a kind of lucid dream but one where the dreamworld is a replication of the room where you went to sleep and it is not easy to change which is a different sort of experience from a normal lucid dream. I had one such lucid dream in college where I wandered around my dorm, then "fell" through a wall and ended up on the street outside. Unfortunately, then I woke up so I didn't get to further explore the experience.

 Too bad the online version of the book doesn't have this symbol on it, or maybe I just haven't read far enough yet. 









 I've always thought that the utilitarian and contractualist ethical schools can be reconciled, at least in part, by adopting the [geometric mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean) rather than the better-known [arithmetic mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean) as the measure of aggregate utility. 

That way, a single person in total privation (like the girl in the Le Guin story who must be tortured in order to provide Utopia for everyone else) would set the measure back to zero. 









 Or a chip in their ear connected to a guy with a laptop. I think the ease of cheating might eventually destroy chess and make something like Go more popular. 




 I'm thinking it was in a book - maybe "Outliers" or "Talent is Overrated" 




 Correct, that 52% is arrived at by counting all words that appear in a given text exactly once. If a non-standard word like "deletable" appears once, it counts just as much as the word "person" which might appear 30 times.

Edit: I just discovered that the Firefox dictionary at least *does* know the word "deletable." 




 There was a study I read about (can't remember where), which measured the IQs of chess grandmasters, and the mean IQ was actually subnormal to a statistically significant degree. Not terribly so, it was somewhere in the mid 90's, but it put paid to the myth of the chess "genius." 

Apparently these grandmasters had spent so much time focusing on such a narrow skill (often from a very early age), that their wider reasoning skills had never developed properly. 

Could at least partially explain all that Bobby Fisher conspiracy theory madness. Chess doesn't drive one mad directly, it merely makes shabby intellects believe that they are geniuses in fields they know nothing about.

 Sounds like the Iron Masks case... 




 That's not even close to the worst that could happen.

Yep. Back in the landline era, you could get your "lines crossed" and end up listening to someone else's conversation. My mom heard two guys talking about how they were going to defraud some company of millions of dollars. It was no joke they were later on the news being arrested by the FBI. 




 That's what they always do with the nutty coalition partners in parliamentary governments, make them the tourism minister. 









 Yeah, same here, and in my opinion the "Lab Animal" was even scarier and the "Pandora's Box" was mighty creepy too. That whole book is still seared into my memory. Major childhood trauma!! 









 In theory. I'll guess that doesn't actually happen very often. As school discipline is opaque by law (at least in the US, don't know about Canada for sure), the public can't know how this policy is actually being implemented. This is to push up graduation rates, it happens in the US all the time. In many districts the lowest grade you can get for a mark is a 50 even if you never attend class once. That way, you can still "make up" the grade and get to passing by the end of the year. 
























 Yeah, 2000 calories per day is "starving" you. Maybe if you're an athlete. Not if you're a lazy fatass who sits in a hospital bed all day.

Depending on how fat these people are, 2000/day might be a pretty significant calorie deficit even if they are just sitting in bed. Larger mass bodies do take more calories just to keep everything "ticking over." This can be an advantage to weight loss, actually, the fat works in your favor in the beginning, but if a person feels forced into it I can easily see it setting off a panic response (which is why "fat camps" for kids rarely work...)

 Right, but declaring bankruptcy destroys your credit, so if you have the income, just paying the loan is the better option in the long run, and if you don't have the income, you're never going to get that much credit. 




 If you have the income, why aren't you just paying your loan? Is it worth the opportunity cost of defaulting on credit cards and going bankrupt? I guess maybe some people don't think that far ahead.

 














 But that would be fraud

How would it be fraud? Credit card cash advances are unsecured debt. However, good luck getting a cash advance large enough to pay off a student loan. 




 It is a local thing. Outside of NY, people still say "in line," though I have noticed an insidious rise in the British "queue," mainly written though, not spoken, and mainly in places that want to act snooty. That's how these language changes often start though. 









 I think Y(t)/t converges to 1. My reasoning is:

Given the Law of Large Numbers:

E[Y(t)]~=E[sum(x)]

E[Y(t)]~=n*E(x)

E[Y(t)]~=n*mu

E[Y(t)]/E(t)~=n*mu/sum(x)

E[Y(t)]/E(t)~=n * mu/(n * mu)

E[Y(t)]/E(t)~=1

 




 Y(t) will grow without bound as t goes to infinity. It doesn't have an asymptote. You will always need more and more instances of x (over the long run) for their sum to surpass higher and higher bounds of t. 

This isn't a very interesting question the way you've worded it which makes me think you might have missed something in the question. Can you go back to your HW and copy out the problem exactly as it is worded? 




 Good reply, thanks. 





























 I didn't say that, etzhadaat did. You, however, said that no one, and thus no Republican, has ever said that, when quite clearly there were some who did say this. 




 All I ever hear from Republicans is that we should let the poor die because they haven't earned our hand-outs.

No one has ever said that. Ever.

I guess you didn't catch the Republican primary debates this year. The audience cheered and shouted "yes, yes" when the moderator said "do you think people without health insurance should just be allowed to die?"

 Cool I will with-hold my skepticism. There have just been too many false claims in the field for me to put too much hope in any one company. Quantum computing was starting to seem like the cold fusion of the computing world. If they really have made some breakthroughs, that would be epic. 




 Here's what I've heard from some people who are "in the know" (or at least plausibly claim to be):

Far from being "material," our universe is actually a very dense form of spiritual power. The point is to compress it to a level that it basically ignites, sort of like nuclear fusion. Consciousness appearing at the "material" level is the spark of that ignition. 














 The CIA also invested millions in psychic "remote viewing." D-wave has always smelled scammy to me - they've been promising huge breakthroughs for over five years now with nothing to show for it. 




 IIRC from a documentary on the subject, this was tried and it didn't work. The algorithms came back with the result that the text was most likely gibberish and there was no code hidden within it. A lot of historians think the manuscript is a hoax (though an old hoax) that was cooked up by some "alchemist" as a secret text and then sold to a gullible nobleman for a tidy sum. Not everyone accepts that conclusion though. 




 To be fair this is only the O'Reilly/Limbaugh wing and Romney and Ryan saying this. The rest of the GOP is telling them to shut the hell up because they known they need some minority votes to win in the future.

On the other hand, that wing of the party really is the Republican Id. Others in the party share those sentiments they just are too smart to express them openly.

 Possibly. I know they had at least one event at the Nuwabian compound, a barbeque or something. I'm no expert on the subject, I just know there is some kind of link. The wikipedia article lists a ton of other acts that were associated with the Nuwabians, most of which were a surprise to me. It seems like Scientology they make an effort to recruit celebrities into the ranks. 




 True. They are about the same level of dangerous. I'd give the edge to NOI though -  they have political influence in several cities including Philly and Oakland. I don't know of any city council members going to speak at Scientology centers. 




 The NOI teaches that the Earth and Moon were once the same

That's a very common occult/fringe religion belief. I have no idea where it originated (medieval alchemy, maybe?) but it shows up all over the the place. 




 That's the only thing you found that was weird? 




 The rappers OutKast are/were loosely associated with the Nuwabians, though I don't think they are official members. 

You can see references to Nuwabian beliefs in the videos for [ATLiens] (http://www.metacafe.com/watch/sy-18086078/outkast_atliens_official_music_video/) - ancient Egypt - and [Elevators](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptPj6K_jJQ) - blacks coming from/returning to another planet.

 Nooo, I meant the equivalence of the Halting Problem and Goldbach has not been proven. I repeated it in the hopes that someone would be familiar with the issue. 




 I'm not saying that's correct, just that someone had mentioned it. I guess you could think of checking each even number as a yes/no question? Not sure what the basis for the comment was, I don't think the poster ever elaborated. 




 Now *that* would be a supremely interesting number - the first number that is not a sum of two primes... 




 Does group theory help at all with these kinds of problems? I don't know much about Goldbach - though I once read a comment here that in the opinion of many it is equivalent to the Halting Problem and thus unsolvable (though this hasn't been proven either.) 




 A shame I think, no?

Did anyone else read this in a Russian accent? 




 United Airlines was union-owned for a while. Unfortunately, it was a bunch of *different* unions and they fought amongst themselves more than they had fought the previous ownership.

Unions don't necessarily represent the pure working class. There are middle-class unions and even business-owner unions. In countries like Venezuela some unions are conservative and oppose the Socialist government. In Poland the trade union Solidarity was a big part in bringing down the Communist government.

This is part of why Communists such as Lenin are not necessarily big fans of unions. Lenin criticized "trade union consciousness" as just another form of bourgeois thinking.

 Brazilians cutting down the rainforest for cropland that will be exhausted in five years anyway because of poor soil quality. 




 Enough so that future generations can have the same benefits from HS sports that they enjoyed.  




 Almost all pro sports players played high school sports. Of course, only a small fraction of HS sports players become pros. However, a pro player would be silly to say "HS sports did nothing for me, I don't think I should have to pay any school tax." 




 In general, those decisions which increase economic growth in the short run by depleting non-renewable resources. 




 But Spongebob is also incredibly friendly and warm to people, a trait not characteristic to autistic people.

That varies. Some autistic children are actually overly friendly, want to talk with strangers   trust them instantly. 




 That is correct, but political decisions are taken on the basis of GDP being a good measure of economic value, that is the problem. 




 And if you're looking to measure the value of open source software its contribution to GDP is just about the least exact measure.

I think that was his point, that economics needs to broaden its definition of value beyond GDP.

Someone who walks or bikes somewhere instead of drives is at least preserving value (if not creating it), by reserving the gasoline for someone who may have no choice but to drive (a disabled person, for example.) 














 True, I forgot to specify, stock-based soups, not cream-based ones. 




 Yep. 




 Seems traceable only back to a NewsMax "journalist." I don't consider that a credible source though presumably you do.  




 More teen pregnancy in red states is probably more a function of poverty than religiosity, though I'm sure the latter contributes as well. Condoms are a sin and you can't buy them in town, but come Friday after the football game, that sex is a sin as well can get forgotten for a while. 




 You can have a Christian-inspired socialism, as exists in South America. Not all socialists are Marxists. 




 You mean that quiz designed by a Libertarian to make anyone who's not a Libertarian look like a Stalinist?  




 What do I not understand about Adlai Stevenson?

The "yellow dog" Democrats at the time - mainly southerners who would rather vote for a "yellow dog" than a Republican. Stevenson was pretty "yellow" in their eyes - he was a northern intellectual, but they voted for him anyway because of the D by his name.  




 Abraham Lincoln was a white supremacist...

That's oversimplified. As a younger man he did think that the "characters" of the races were too different from one another for them to live together in peace, and the best solution was for the slaves to be freed and emigrate to a climate more suited to their culture, like the Caribbean. I think he mentioned Haiti as an example of a successful black Republic being formed in that region.

Also, that was the Lincoln of 1845. The Lincoln of 1865 had come to see the long view of history, and supported not only emancipation but voting rights and the right to hold public office for blacks who owned property or who had served in the military - which is what got him shot by Booth.  




 Any source on those Johnson quotes?  




 Even if so, it would be interesting. The movement seems to be falling apart right now, with so many high-level defections and even heretical offshoots appearing that claim to be the original Hubbardism! There are even rumors Cruise is leaving. 




 I should specify: Not a leader or a PR person, just an ordinary member, preferably one who's been in the organization a number of years and spent a good deal of money on the courses. 




 If I remember correctly, Bush campaigned on letting younger people opt out of the system altogether, and letting everyone, even those already retired, put their money in 401(k)-style accounts that they could choose to place with mutual fund companies like Fidelity. This is why Gore kept hounding him on the "lockbox" that he was so mocked for. As for the actual bill that got introduced, I don't know if it was that radical in its final version.

At least as it has been reported in the media, Ryan's plan involves replacing Medicare with $6000 vouchers (the per-person cap) with which people could buy private insurance. The government would still subsidize insurance for the elderly, but would no longer guarantee it. Again, this would be phased in, with people over 55 allowed to stay in "traditional" Medicare. 




  Even Ron Paul's budget preserved SS and medicare. 

It envisioned phasing them out, as does Paul Ryan's budget, at least for Medicare, and Bush II tried to privatize SS. I don't think there's as much of a gap between the old and the new Right as you think - they're still fighting the New Deal. 




 how is the modern right progressive? Because it supports foreign interventions? Other than that I don't see too much difference ideologically between the "old" and "new" right.  




 well McCarthy went down in flames once he started questioning Eisenhower and the Army, but it launched Nixon's political career, and Bobby Kennedy's, though the right-wingness of either of them later in their lives is debatable to say the least.

I thought you meant the Right in general. For the old Taft wing, you have a point.

 Salads aren't actually that great, especially with the stuff most people put on them. Soups and stews have the lowest ratio, dried breads and grains (crackers and chips), and nuts have the highest.

 Not really. Foods with a low calorie/volume ratio will fill you up before you can really overeat to an extent that would make you obese. 




 That was part of the hypocrisy pointed out in the article: You can't make an argument for regulating sex choices unless you're also in favor of regulating food choices.   




 Half of the "organic" aisle at my local supermarket is chips and other junk food.  




 Good explanation, thanks. It makes sense they would not want to appear to be giving in to a "Red Scare" given the time period and the memories of the 50's.

To ask a a follow-up question, how in the world did Trotskyists gain positions of power in the local unions to begin with? Your typical American union would laugh them out of the hall, unless they felt like beating them to a pulp instead. Were/are things different in the UK? 




 I never understood why the leadership tolerated the Trotskyites in the Labor Party at all. In the US, where you can join a party automatically when you renew your driver's license, it's hard to keep figures like David Duke or Pat Buchanan out,  but I always thought party membership in the UK was more tightly controlled. 
























 The mods will nuke it sooner or later... too bad because under the inane comments there's some good ones. 




 There are some nutty billionaires trying to do this. Peter Thiel wants to create a giant floating cruise ship/city-state/tax haven for Libertarians only that will sail around the world spreading the gospel of liberty or something. 

I think the whole thing will degenerate into an argument about whether or not lifeboats are a collectivist monstrosity, and end with a colossal legal battle concerning homestead rights in the buffet line, but I wish him well. 




 I know this was a username joke, but I'm sure there are plenty of people who were with you until the "elimination of inferior humans" part. 

It's hard for us to admit, but the continued fascination today with Nazis (and to a more limited extent Communists) points to a very deep human political need for exactly those things: Vision, will, strength, beauty...

 **TL;DR** summary:

Many people don't work because the cost of commuting, suitable clothing, child care, and the like comes to nearly everything they would earn, if not more. Raising their taxes would only increase the disincentives to work. 



















 Certain people of an occult persuasion believe the Earth and the sun formed "one body" in relatively recent times (like 10,000 years ago, not 4.5 billion).  This "plasma formations" theory might be a variant on that belief. 




 Let's go with the subtle satire explanation... less embarassing... 









 I agree, to me there's no difference between the two belief systems, but the fact that the Mormons aren't in the majority but are trying to "fit in" these days make them downplay these doctrines, and plus, as I just demonstrated, it's real real easy to make them sound like a UFO cult. I'm surprised South Park hasn't done them yet. 




 It used to be better known, but the LDS today downplays these teachings in an attempt to be more "mainstream" (mainstream as defined by religious right - Republican, etc.)

They don't exactly want it widely known that [Mitt Romney is a Bishop a church that believes God is an alien from the Planet Kolob](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolob).

 I combined my responses to your two messages here. In case I got too wordy for you I put the **TL;DR** main points of my argument in bold.

.


Holding a belief, just because famous people held, is in general poor form. It is no defense for that belief.

As a non-expert, I am unfortunately reliant on the opinions of these "famous people." Alas, these vary greatly, from transcendentalists like Gdel to straight materialists like Krauss, and every shade in between, so I attempt to find among their views those that seem the most consistent, and which accord most closely with my own phenomenological experience. I admit the possibility that I have failed in this task.

.

 don't know any experts (I.e people who study consciousness and have a grasp of quantum mechanics... Note these are very few) that hold your view. 

Who are some people you know whom you feel have a grasp of both cogsci and QM? I would be interested to read the opinions of these dual experts. Penrose I think comes closest, but you're obviously not a fan.

You are quite right that the debate has mainly been a few adventuresome QM experts saying their field has implications for consciousness, and neuroscientists disagreeing with them (although *philosophers of mind* are sometimes a different story, and are occasionally more receptive to the views of these physicists.)

.


A notorious example is David Bohm and his holonomic brain theory. 

I am not a fan of Bohm. I don't even think his ideas are even coherent, let alone correct.  That the lenses in our eyes somehow keep us from seeing the holographic universe? It sounds like the ravings of a schizophrenic...

.

 In general, there is nothing wrong with being a dualist

Ugh, I disagree. Trying to formulate one fundamental ontology for existence is difficult enough, let alone two. I am not a dualist, at least not in the "two original substances, matter and mind" sense of the word. I don't think you can be a dualist without ultimately falling into the absurdities of Descartes and/or Leibniz. I do think though that a non-formal element is entailed by the existence of the physical world (see below.)

.

How would quantum computing be anti-formalist? How do you think we study quantum computing? It is an extremely formal field.


**I will address QM in general here, as I get to its computing aspect below: QM is extremely formal, perhaps the most formal theory ever devised, but precisely in being so it "heightens the contradictions" of formalism. It resorts to such things as negative probabilities, objects that are both waves and particles at the same time, and, as I learned from your article link, probabilities that don't add up to 1 and that violate the sure-thing principle.**

**This sort of thing, to me, points to the fact that we are trying to study a non-formal aspect of reality with formalist tools, and, however successful the mathematics has been, at root logical incoherence is the result. I will perhaps further irritate you and name-drop the ultimate famous person here and say the Einstein had similar criticisms of the ultimate logical validity of QM.**

.


To me it sounds that by non-formalist, you mean non-physicalist.

Not exactly. My philosophy is closer to people like Tarski and Gdel who wrote on the limitations of formal logic. I would consider them to be anti-Formalists under my definition, though usually this term is not applied to them by historians of philosophy (they reserve it for woolier figures like William James...). 

[And before you say Gdel wasn't a physicalist, I would disagree. To me Platonists are the ultimate physicalists. I won't elaborate more here as we'd go down a very long side-path.]

.


I would also distinguish between a *non*-formalist (someone like Meillassoux who thinks the Universe is a "hyper-chaos" that only *appears* sensible) and an anti-formalist (someone like me who thinks that there is more to the Universe than formal processes.) 

.


For me the physical universe is very real, it is not just the dream of a butterfly or some such nonsense, but, by the very virtue of its being real, it contains a non-formal, though not necessarily non-physical, element, that is, something that can *never be explained* by a formal system. Note that this does not mean the element is mystical or supernatural in any way. 

.


**To me it is no coincidence that QM and consciousness both seem to produce a "decoherence" of logical discourse - it is very difficult to talk about either of them using ordinary logical principles, a sign that they both belong to the non-formal aspect of reality. Do they share any connection beyond a connection of type? My intuition is that they do - and that the vast computing power promised by Quantum Computing and the vast apprehensive ability possessed by consciousness are signs of this link.**

.


Without boring you with an entire manifesto, my "anti-Formalist" view is that formal systems cannot provide a complete description of reality, that logic always needs to refer to a non-logical "ground" in order to avoid contradiction, and therefore there is always a gap between a formal description of reality and the Real itself, and that consciousness lives, at least in part, in this gap.

Where do I get these weird ideas? Well, I see an unnamed but important line of thought in philosophy passing from Hegel to the post-Incompleteness generation of mathematicians, and then through figures like Heidegger and Lacan to modern thinkers such as Badiou (though I don't share the latter's politics.) I've come to think of this as the "anti-Formalist" line of thought, though that's my own term for it, nothing official. If you are not familiar with any of these writers, they hold that each entity contains a gap, a "not-all" within itself that not only allows for but *insists* that something radically "Other" must emerge from within.

.


So yes, I've outed myself as one of those damn Continental-philosophy fanboys, the kind of dupe who you probably think would have been fooled by the Sokal Hoax had I not been in grade school at the time. Do with me as you will!

.


Their ideas on consciousness were very naive and motivated not by a psychological problem but by the physics/philosophy problem of measurement in quantum mechanics. 

I am interested on your views on the measurement problem. Do you think it can be resolved (or dissolved as Wittgenstein would say) without a reference to consciousness, either on a human or a cosmic level? If so, how? [You might be interested in this article](http://www.bigquestionsonline.com/print/138). It is close to my views though I wouldn't use the term "God" as it's too historically freighted.

.


The reason I would like to see this is because I'd've never seen an intelligent defense of quantum mysticism and I would really like to see one. 

You won't get one from me - I'm not a quantum mystic, at least if by that you mean the belief that, say, entanglement means people can have psychic powers, or things of that sort. I am open-minded towards the paranormal, though not a believer. I like to say I don't want to be so open-minded that my brain falls out!


 




 Interesting links, I will check them out. I'd heard of the first idea but not the second. 

I am not an expert in these fields, but my opinion is not just "empty statements," as it is informed by and resembles that of some people who are experts. If I'm going to expend the time conversing with you I do expect some civility on your part. 




 I was just pointing out that many famous scientists have believed in or theorized about a connection between *biology* and QM, and if we accept that consciousness is a biological process at least on some level, then there may indeed be a QM component to consciousness, just as there is in other biological systems.

You might think the links between quantum effects and cell biology are "nothing special," but until recently biology was thought to be explainable in wholly classical terms, except by some visionaries like Schrdinger,  and now we know that's not true. 

You are right that Gdel was a Platonist, and also right he didn't think that the link between his Theorems and consciousness was related to QM, but you were rubbishing that idea as well, so I thought I'd admit where I stand on that issue as well.

Fundamentally I am an "anti-Formalist" when it comes to consciousness, meaning I think that somehow (whether through QM or Platonic Forms, or some other mechanism), consciousness exists at least in part outside the formal, "billiard-ball" world of classical physics.

Oh, and the fact is I have read what you've read, we just disagree. I don't claim to be an expert, but when the experts disagree, the layman is allowed his opinion.

 




 Well, to Penrose you would also have to add the even more formidable name of Schrdinger, who theorized on this issue in his "What is Life?" 

As for Gdel I guess this will get me in an even deeper hole with you, but I do indeed think there is a link between the Incompleteness Theorems (there's more than one) and consciousness as well. Of course, Gdel himself believed this, but then, Gdel wasn't a brain scientist and he went crazy, etc. etc. (You can tell I've had this argument before.)

Anyway. I'm not saying microtubules are what links QM effects to consciousness, it could be some other mechanism. Recently some solid links between QM and biology have been found, for example [in the navigational systems of birds](http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.3725). It's not consciousness - yet - but it does show a link between the biological and quantum worlds. 

I am "agnostic" on this link in a strictly scientific-method sense, but in a broader philosophical context, due to what I see as weaknesses in traditional naturalism, yet as someone unwilling to accept dualism or a purely "mystical" explanation for consciousness, the link to quantum processes seems suggestive, though not conclusive. 




 I have not read much technical literature and I realize popular articles on the subject can be sensationalistic or misinformed. However I still think there **might** be a connection between quantum states and consciousness, and there are some well-informed experts (Penrose, for example) who believe so as well. Do I have definite proof? No - that's why I used the word "believe" instead of "know" or "can prove."

 




 Haha, very civil reply. Anyway, ignoring your nastiness, my hypothesis is that the ability to process information and yet be in observation of the same process simultaneously, which seems to be an ability of human consciousness, might also be a characteristic of these sorts of computers. If quantum computers are possible, being able to calculate in super-position states might grant them this ability. 




 Are any of those episodes online? I stopped listening to C2C once it got so political but I'd love to hear Dr. Taff interviewed.

 How complicated would it be to switch to ECC from RSA? 




 It wasn't him, it was one of his followers. According to legend, the follower was killed for his discovery since it went against the Pythagorean belief in the sanctity of whole-number ratios.

According to another, more cool legend, the follower was killed not because he made the discovery but because he *talked about it publicly*, revealing esoteric knowledge that was only meant for the Pythagorean elite.

In addition to being mathematicians, the Pythagoreans were also a religious cult. Imagine a cross between the MIT Pure Math faculty and Scientology. 




 See [here](http://www.mpg.de/5925490/meta-consciousness-brain) 




 Chalmers sees consciousness as a Cartesian theater when he talks about consciousness is "presented" to him, as if he were a member of the audience watching his senses take the stage. He questions why processes are "accompanied" by experience, as if experience is an extra effort of theatricality for his enjoyment.

But isn't this exactly the case? That the conscious perception of a color is somehow different from say, how a computer would analyze visual wavelengths seems undeniable. Do you believe that a computer sees the color blue just as you do, that it has the same experience? I don't.

This element of theatricality, of presentation, is *precisely* the hard problem. Even if it is an illusion, it seems that this illusion could not arise except from a *prior ground of theatricality* that already exists!

Where I might differ from the Clarmers position is I think computers, probably quantum computers, will someday begin to have these presentations. That will be quite the interesting day. 









 Bad statistics... the US is coming off a much higher base of education than most of these other countries. Percentage growth in this sort of context *must* level out over time (you can't have more than 100% of people getting higher degrees than their parents). 




 a favorable deal for the union means higher taxes or less gov't services

Not necessarily less services if a good deal attracts better employees or helps to reduce turnover. 




 That's a shame your local is so messed up. 




 AFT or NEA? 




 Some students live in chaotic homes, have to take care of their siblings, etc. Yet both are graded on the same rubric?

Eh, not really. Almost all teachers, myself included, will give a lot of breaks and extra help to kids we know are having trouble at home.  




 Haha well I am the young guard - believe me most locals are looking for people. I agree about the PR. 




 A student can choose how much to study and how much to pay attention in class. A teacher cannot choose his or her students or force them to study. That is the difference. 




 From my experience most union locals are desperate for people to fill executive positions and often have to beg people to run. Yes it's more work but you can't complain if you don't get involved. 




 That's funny, the gist of the article was exactly the opposite, that MWI is the only thing that can save physicalism. What is your thinking on that argument? 









 Israel is held to a different standard because it came into existence as a *modern* Western-supported state, and, in part because of the pressure of modern Western morality, it didn't kick out or kill *all* of the people in the conquered land, though it did plenty of killing, don't kid yourself.

Had Israel been established and expanded in the 19th Century, like the US, and killed, ghettoized or expelled most of the Arabs, as the US did with the Indians, there would be no big debate.

That being said, the rich Arab oil states could easily pay to resettle the Palestinians - say in the Hejaz - but have chosen not to as that would be "giving in" to Israel . The Palestinians I have a lot of sympathy for. Both Israel and their Arab adversaries, though, not so much.

 Lee repeats the story himself, but I don't know of any independent confirmation. It sounds like the sort of grandiose story he would tell about himself. 




 They didn't think much of Japan militarily. It was a huge shock when Singapore fell. The British Navy removed a lot of fleet elements from Asia to reinforce the homeland. This might have been necessary, but they also didn't think it would be that big of a deal and that the forces they left behind would easily defeat the Japanese.

When the British blew the bridges into Singapore, legend has it that a man asked the future leader of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, what the sound was.

Lee replied: "That's the sound of the end of the British Empire." 




 I doubt he was. Usually however there was a picture of his invention with a black slave working with it. This is how this misconception got started. I believed it in elementary school too. 




 Actually it does, it's more malleable and platable than most other metals. And many people prefer how it looks to silver and platinum. That doesn't necessarily translation to monetary value though, platinum has often traded higher than gold per ounce. 




 Talk about stuff people were taught wrong in school... the gold standard had not been honored domestically since FDR. Only foreign drawers were allowed to exchange Federal Reserve notes for gold into the 70's, and this was only because basically no one did. 

When the French and Swiss governments decided to express displeasure with Nixon's inflationary policy and redeem all their notes for gold, Nixon and the Fed said "screw you" and closed the international gold window as well. 

It had nothing to do with economic growth and insufficient amounts of gold being dug up.

 Britain was already fighting in both wars, I don't think this holds up. 




 No, in most states further education is a state requirement, often at your own expense. Imagine continuing to pay for college classes or pile on more debt while making $30K per year.

You do get a pay raise for attaining higher degrees, but it's often not enough to make up for the additional cost of classes, and because you're trying to cram in summer and weekend courses, it can often take 10+ years to get a further degree.
 




 In my opinion the content knowledge is usually easier to acquire than the teaching skills. It's ironic that it's very hard to teach people how to teach, even though in aggregate it's just a bunch of simple skills and habits.

 I have always been a fan of the "Yoda was in on it" theory - he knew what was going to happen, but let it take place because the Jedi Order and the Republic had become too corrupt and complacent.

 The party should bring back the old slogan from the FDR days: "If you want to live like a Republican, vote for the Democrat." 









 some of his contemporaries held the materialist position we now associate with modernism, and the Buddha explicitly rejected it. 

I still think it's fascinating that there were materialist-atheists in 400 BC. One would be inclined to assume that these were just "strawman" positions people pinned on their opponents, but no, we actually have texts from these groups! Similar ideas show up in Greece not too long afterwards.

 That's not too impressive. A lot of HR departments use the same set of tests on prospective hires. I took the same stupid computer psychology test at least five times. 




 The new age, pseudo spiritualism that is often saddled on it.

Do you distinguish that from traditional belief in the Siddhis, or is it all superstitious accretion to you?

I'm ambivalent - some mediators I respect have claimed supernatural experiences, but I can't bring myself to totally buy it. It's easy to enter into a dreamlike state when you're in meditation. I've yet to see anyone levitate, in other words, and that Discovery Channel "documentary" doesn't count. 




 Sort of... but to a materialist suicide is annihilation, whereas the idea that Nirvana is annihilation is classified as a wrong view.

Suicide = Nirvana in the absence of rebirth is a false implication. 




 The final goal of Buddhism is Nirvana which only makes sense as opposed to Samsara which is the circle of perpetual birth-and-death. 

What about the view that Nirvana and Samsara are just different attitudes or reactions towards the same reality? Hippie talk and not real Buddhism, some say. I'm not so sure.

In fact, Nirvana is absolute bliss, and is not like nothingness or blackness at all. 

But bliss is still a sensation, and Nirvana is supposed to be super-sensate. Not trying to split hairs but I think it's an important distinction.

 




 I'm not sure about the first picture, but the second looks pretty accurate.
