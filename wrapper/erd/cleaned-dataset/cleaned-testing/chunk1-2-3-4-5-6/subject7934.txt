How it works: You follow people and places, and they leave messages for you around the city. When you walk near one, you get an alert on your phone. Its like Twitter for your map, with, uh, alerts. Make sense?

Follow lots of people   places (so you can experience the alerts feature), then walk around the city. Weve got a couple of foodies in there, so try following them, or places like Great American Music Hall, Castro Theater, etc, which produce great alerts.
Were really curious to hear feedback. Thanks!

 You know how your dishrags and sponges get slimy after you've used them a while?  That's bacterial build up.  Sterilize them with a 1-2min spin in your microwave on high.  Time varies depending on how strong your microwave oven is, but as long as the sponge is quite hot to the touch and steaming, you've probably killed off ~99% of the nasties.  Enjoy cleaner, fresher smelling and less slimy dishrags.

What would have happened had a camera not fortuitously captured the truth?  Very possibly a completely innocent guy might have not only gone to jail (as he did), but also ended up with a record of assault - against a police officer.  Add to this that they regularly plant drugs to meet quotas.  Yet, in the absence of direct evidence, our judicial system treats their word as incontrovertible.  What will it take to change the presumption that  police are truthful? 




 Cut your lemon in half.  Stick a fork straight into the cut side.  As you're squeezing the lemon, rock the fork back and forth parallel to the line of tines.  This cuts into the flesh of the lemon and breaks it up, releasing more juice than just squeezing it alone.  






































































































































 Here is the interview with Colbert, if you haven't seen it already: http://gawker.com/5855105/stephen-colbert-trolls-occupy-wall-street "I'm a female-bodied person" and other choice quotes in this video.

OWS needs to stay on message and not veer off into weird gender issue language like this girl did.  This is exactly what killed the Left in the 80s.  Let's keep it practical and focused on the economic issues.

**EDIT**: Someone asked "WTF does killed  the left in the 80s refer to?"  

That was the era of Political Correctness - a term they themselves used. I was at Brown at the time. I became disgusted when some of these activists started posting signs on men's bathrooms informing them that "rape is not sex". I'm a guy and used to refer to myself as a feminist. They lost me at that moment. And then minority groups (I am one) started whining about their "subaltern identities". It was absurd, self-absorbed, divisive and just completely repellent to people who weren't crazed ideologues. Rush Limbaugh rose to fame complaining about this stuff. The rest is history.

 Indeed, Israel is far worse. 



















 eval-buffer is an EmacsLisp command. 









  a lot but half of our disappointment in Obama is that things cant get done in the rest of congress.

Lots of stuff he didn't do that he could have done: investigate war crimes, reign in the NSA, directed Holder to prosecute financial crimes instead of drug crimes and copyright "crimes"; he could have appointed someone other than a telecom industry exec to oversee the FCC (who is now predictably dismantling net neutrality) .  Those items, just off the top of my head, demonstrate that Obama is a conservative, like his hero Ronald Reagan.  Now, in terms of policy initiatives, he scuttled the hugely popular public option and universal care behind closed doors with industry execs, and implemented a complex Heritage institute plan that forces us all to be customers of the for-profit insurance industry.

 Hilary is more likely to get congress moving again and you know it

Hillary is more likely to serve monied interests.  That's all she's likely to do (and you know it). 




 Good luck on Hillary doing anything but servicing her lobbyists. 









 Exactly what was said about Obama. 




 Krugman called it: http://consultingbyrpm.com/blog/2009/12/krugman-did-identify-the-housing-bubble-in-2005.html 




 Python, Ruby, Node.js, Objective-C, now looking at Go.

No Haskell/ML ever, apart from casual perusing, I'm afraid. 









 Extensive public record, her research focus as a professor, and of course, major legislation she's sponsored and gotten passed.   




  Sadly, Warren is a two-issue candidate, with those issues being financial reform,  and being a woman who is not Hillary. 

That is just plain wrong.  She's been quite prominent on unions, domestic wiretapping, taxation, education loan reform, workplace safety, civil rights, bankruptcy, corporate power, and energy policy.  

 In 2008 we fielded a candidate with a formidable progressive brand and platform rather than a formidable progressive record.

Warren has an incredible record for her short tenure, unlike Obama. 

And Obama was not a progressive;  he even stated that publicly, saying that his ardent followers were attributing their politics to him incorrectly.  And he proved this in the primaries by supporting telecom immunity (against wiretapping charges) and Joe Lieberman over the progressive Ned Lamont, just to name a couple of issues.  Obama was at best a cypher if you weren't paying attention, but it was actually pretty obvious in the primaries that he was a conservative.  














 Seriously? 









 It's not "moderated down to a level" - it's been censored. 




 Oh dear.  Quite right.  (It's been about 5 years since I used CL.)  It should have been:

     (setf (gethash '= +query-operators+) #'equal-query-op)


*EDIT*: fixed 














 You don't replace mappings in the symbol table - you store mappings in a separate hash-table:

    (defconstant +query-operators+ (make-hash-table))
    (defun equal-query-op (var arg)
       (format nil "~a=~a" var arg))
    (defun not-equal-query-op (var arg)
       (format nil "~a~!=~a" var arg))
    (setf (gethash '= +query-operators+) #'equal-query-op)
    (setf (gethash '!= +query-operators+) #'not-equal-query-op)

Then, you just need a function that takes a list with a query operator as the first element and returns the parameter string:

    (defun query-param (qexp)
       (let ((op (first qexp))
             (op-args (rest qexp)))
          (apply (gethash op +query-operators+) op-args)))

And just map this method over the list:

    (mapcar #'query-param '((= first.name bob) (!= last.name jones)))

Which will yield a list of strings:

    ("first.name=bob" "last.name!=jones")

Which can be concatenated with FORMAT:

    (format nil "~{~a~^ ~}"
            (mapcar #'query-param '((= first.name bob) (!= last.name jones))))

Which gives:

    "first.name=bob last.name!=jones"
            
-----------------------
**EDIT**: fixed bugs (thanks, /u/spacebat) 




  just another downside of attaching healthcare to employment

Yup, Hobby Lobby showed us that. 




 How many different comparison operators do you have?  Is it just != and = or are there more?  

And "name.last!=jones" is valid but odd query syntax.  A typical web framework will pass a parameter named "name.last!" to the handler function.  So how are you going to encode other comparators?

The most straightforward and lispiest way is what someone else here suggested:

(query 'person '((= name.first bob) (!= name.last jones)))

Yes you will need to provide functions to do the conversion of lists into strings.  If you have a small number of operators, honestly an if or cond expression wouldn't be awful.   

Alternatively, you could keep a hash-table that maps the operator symbols (=, !=, etc) to parser functions.  The table would map the equal symbol to the = parser, etc.

Does that make sense? 














  Edit: Just for reference, [here](http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials-obama-care/120313-681526-cancer-patient-bill-elliott-audited-over-obamacare.htm ) is a story about an unitended effect of the ACA. It just makes me think that the people who supported the ACA didn't actually care enough the effects to do any prior research or put any more work into the bill to ensure this kind of thing didn't happen

Actually, the rightwing outlets reporting this are the ones that didn't do the research.  The story you're referencing is full of holes and untruths.  This has been a pretty common pattern for anti-Obamacare pieces reported on rightwing sites like the one you linked.

 I'm really puzzled by the hate for 47 Ronin.  It received a 13% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes (and was at 0% for top critics).  I really don't understand - it's not the greatest film, but it's certainly very far from the worst.  The visuals are gorgeous, and the script was reasonable - it certainly wasn't insulting like so many others that get much higher marks.  There weren't grating characters, the CGI was deployed tastefully and well done.

 The default orangered upvote count color provided by RES makes Reddit extremely difficult to parse.  The default upvote count draws the eyes away from the title at each line and toward the orangered highlight color at each line.

Compare here: http://imgur.com/a/CEJWX

Orangered is a strong color which Reddit uses to highlight and distinguish noteworthy elements:
   
   * user has upvoted an article
   * user has selected a tab (hot/new/etc)
   * user has new mail

Using orangered for # of upvotes adds a highlight on every line and creates a number of problems:
   
  * confuses the meaning of the highlight color
  * draws attention to a minor detail
  * reduces the readability of the site.  

I initially immediately uninstalled RES because of this particular feature.  I bet many other first-time users have had the same response.  It's worth an A/B test.    (I only kept RES this time after I discovered I could customize it to a neutral color.)

For my two cents, I think the upvote/downvote color should be the same gray color as other elements in that line (#888888), perhaps distinguishing up and downvotes using + and -.  E.g., (+100|-10).  
 






















































 Couple of thoughts:

First some basics: Rice pasta is cheap and ubiquitous.  Rice breads are easy to find too, and not too expensive.  Order burgers with a lettuce wrap.  Rice / asian food is often your friend, but watch out for soy, which often contains gluten, however, you may be able to tolerate in small quantities.  If you're eating sushi, ask for tamari - many sushi places in big cities have this, but you have to ask.

Careful with steroids - oral prednisone  can cause bounce back.  Because your gut is most exposed, you get bounce back in the gut, which can lead to more food allergy.

 Both primitive savage Islamic states and primitive savage Jewish states ought to be isolated. 




 Typical JPost garbage, perfectly illustrates pro-Israeli arguments:  ignore the main issue, the bombing of a densely packed open air prison filled with people whose homes have been stolen, and instead talk about lofty words in Israel's constitution.

This bit was particularly funny.

 "Israel has never had laws that overtly discriminated between citizens on the basis of race."

There are more than 50 Israeli laws that discriminate against Palestinian citizens of Israel in all areas of life, including their rights to political participation, access to land, education, state budget resources, and criminal procedures. Some of the laws also violate the rights of Palestinians living in the 1967 OPT and Palestinian refugees.

  Even if Noam Chomsky is correct, he still sort of comes off as a nutcase.

Seriously, this is totally useless name calling. 

 Chomsky often wanders into these broader schemes that no one can immediately relate to or even imagine.

Have you ever read any of his books, or are you just responding to hearing fragments from him?   If your experience is growing up in the United States over the past 30 years, he's going to sound like an alien from another planet.  But, if that's not the case - you grew up during or before the 70s or were born outside, he's not such a stretch.  In any case, what matters is not the feeling he gives you, but specific cases.  Look into the details.  Chomsky tends to defend his positions with powerful scholarship. 




 Does anyone remember Unclaimed Territory?  I remember thinking that someone had finally come to take the torch from Chomsky.  Greenwald has a different style and his work has a much more journalistic focus, but he reminds me of Chomsky's deconstructive approach, letting establishment figures convict themselves with their own words.  




 These critics feel very emotional about Greenwald, but can do  little other than resort to name calling and unsubstantiated allegations.   




 The people criticizing him for his recent reporting  like Karl Rove's dancing partner, David Gregory, or Jefferey Toobin, believe that the press should only report what the government wants them to.  Were it up to them, Daniel Ellesberg would have been in jail.

 Have you spoken with her? 














 These mendacious hasbara efforts only serve to deepen  disgust for Israeli fascism.  The perception all over the world is that Israel, and Israelis, have turned into monsters, who steal, lie and kill, and then cry that *they* are the victims, even as they bomb the open air prison filled with those whose homes they stole.  Tell me again about those three Israeli kids.  What a joke.  All you are doing is cementing everyone's disgust at this country and its defenders. 




 You'll need a bath after fighting with this Hasbara troll. 




  Unfortunately, come November 2016, barring any "real" choice she will be yet another lesser of two evils.

I'm hoping Warren joins the race.  Without her, I agree, it's looking pretty bleak.

 But, as I said, even Bernie wouldn't criticize Israel.

Disappointing, but such is the culture of fear the Lobby has created.  I can't really blame him or Warren for their votes, though I'm not happy with them. 




 Agree that the Israel lobby holds great sway, however, I don't think Clinton is any way *forced* into the kind of hawkish stance she's taken.  Israel's actions have been decried across the world and are described as war crimes by major human rights organizations, yet not a peep from her about moderation.   

Very few are getting out as far ahead as Clinton is.  No one *forced* make the case for Israel, though they may be forced to take votes for them.  [Clinton is pushing the envelope here,  throwing her support behind far right policies.](http://www.mediaite.com/online/moveon-slams-clinton-for-embracing-policies-of-right-wing-war-hawks/ ).  

I understand you disagree with her statements too, but making excuses for politicians - "everybody's doing it, she has to too" - is really a way of giving cover to odious policies.  And in a small way, contributes to such politicians being able to get away with it.  The "left" in this country spends far too much time negotiating itself out of its own beliefs under the misguided idea that electing conservatives under our own brand counts for something.   The truth is that Clinton is a hawkish globalist, and we ought to be call her out on it. 









 Sell! Sell! 


































 Agree, but, it's one thing to go with the flow, another to bang the drums. 




 This article seems to confirm Hightower's claims:

 The jump in losses was largely due to a $1.5 billion increase in operating expenses as a result of workers compensation payments, the agency said.

 USPS blames much of its financial troubles on a 2006 mandate to stow away billions of dollars for its future retirees' healthcare. The Postal Service already defaulted on three of its payments into the fund and does not expect to make the next $5.7 billion installment due September 30.
 



















 We're in violent agreement. 




 Full text - part 2

Most remarkable of all, Clinton tells Goldberg that, If I were the prime minister of Israel, youre damn right I would expect to have security [control over the West Bank]. What makes this statement so remarkable is that earlier in the interview, Hillary praised the Clinton parameters outlined by her husband in December 2000. Those parameters permit Israeli troops to remain in the Jordan Valley, along the West Banks border with Jordan, for three years. Later in the interview, Clinton claims that she convinced Abbas to agree to allow Israeli troops to remain for six, seven, eight years and that she got Netanyahu to go from forever to 2025 as a date for their withdrawal. Even this, from a Palestinian perspective, represents painful backsliding from the position outlined by Hillarys husband. But as Hillary must know, Bibi three weeks ago said that in light of regional developments, there cannot be a situation, under any agreement, in which we relinquish security control of the territory west of the River Jordan. Which is to say that, as of now, Bibis position really does seem to be forever. Yet rather than challenge that stance, Clinton endorses it. 

Why does Clinton again and again endorse Netanyahus view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict even when it contradicts long-standing American positions? Because shes so willing to see the world through his eyes. Notice how she begins her statement about security control of the West Bank: If I were the prime minister of Israel. Theres nothing wrong with that. U.S. officials should understand, and empathize with, Israeli leaders, even right-wing ones. But whats missing from Clintons interview is any willingness to do the same for Palestinians. If its so easy to understand why some Israelis might want perpetual military control of the West Bank, why cant Clinton understand why Palestinians - after living for almost fifty years under a foreign army - might not want it to indefinitely patrol their supposedly independent state.

One of the hallmarks of Barack Obamas statements about Israel and Palestine, going back to his 2008 presidential campaign, has been his insistence on giving voice to the fears and aspirations of both sides. Writing about his trip to Israel in The Audacity of Hope, Obama wrote that, I talked to Jews whod lost parents in the Holocaust and brothers in suicide bombings; I heard Palestinians talk of the indignities of checkpoints and reminisce about the land they had lost. In Jerusalem last March, he spoke movingly, and in detail about the Jewish story, but also asked Israelis to put yourself in their [the Palestinians] shoes. Look at the world through their eyes. In her interview with Goldberg, thats exactly what Clinton does not do. Her interpretations of recent Israeli-Palestinian history reflect from a deep imbalance: a willingness to see reality through Israeli eyes and an almost total refusal to do the same for Palestinians.

For far too long, wrote Aaron Miller in 2005, many American officials involved in Arab-Israeli peacemaking, myself included, have acted as Israel's attorney, catering and coordinating with the Israelis at the expense of successful peace negotiations. From the beginning, Barack Obama has tried to avoid that. Although he hasnt brokered Israeli-Palestinian peace, he has tried to make good on his campaign promise to hold up a mirror to both sides. In Hillary Clinton, by contrast, at least judging from her interview on Sunay, Israel has yet another lawyer. And a very good one at that.  




 Full text - part 1

Israels new lawyer: Hillary Clinton

Whos the Israeli governments best spokesperson? Ron Dermer? Michael Oren? Bibi himself? Nope. Its Hillary Clinton. In her interview on Sunday with Jeffrey Goldberg, Clinton offered the most articulate, sophisticated, passionate defense of Netanyahus conduct Ive heard from a government official on either side of the Atlantic. Unfortunately, important chunks of it arent true.

Lets take her claims in turn.

In his first term, Netanyahu moved towards a Palestinian state

Clinton began her defense of Bibi by noting that in his first term, in the late 1990s, he had give[n] up territory and moved in that direction [towards a Palestinian state], as hard as it was.

Thats extremely generous. Its true that in 1997, Bibi withdrew Israeli troops from most of the West Bank city of Hebron (though they can reenter any time Israel wants) and the following year signed the Wye River Accords, under which Israel was supposed to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinian Authority (though Bibis government fell before it could do so).


What Clinton leaves out is that Bibi only agreed to these withdrawals to forestall the far larger ones envisioned under the Oslo Accords he inherited from Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres. In 1993, when Oslo was signed, Bibi publicly compared it to Neville Chamberlains surrender of the Sudetenland to Adolf Hitler.

He accepted Oslo in the 1996 election campaign only because he couldnt repudiate a process endorsed by the Israeli center and championed by the United States. So Bibi sabotaged Oslo by accelerating settlement growth and minimizing the amount of land Israel relinquished. Before I took office, he later boasted, the conception was to give away everything except for two percent [of West Bank] while I turned everything around and gave just two percent to [full control] of the Palestinian Authority. Or as he told settlers after leaving office, I stopped the Oslo Accords. 


The Clinton administration officials who dealt with Bibi in his first term understood this all too well. Neither President Clinton nor Secretary [Madeleine] Albright believed that Bibi had any real interest in pursuing peace, writes Dennis Ross in The Missing Peace. Ross deputy, Aaron Miller, adds in his memoir that, all of us saw Bibi as a kind of speed bump that would have to be negotiated along the way until a new Israeli prime minister came along who was more serious about peace.

Thats a far cry from what Hillary told Goldberg. Then again, Ross and Miller arent running for president.

Bibi agreed to a settlement freeze but Abbas wouldnt negotiate

Fast-forwarding to the Obama years, Clinton claims that, I got Netanyahu to agree to the unprecedented settlement freeze It took me nine months to get Abbas into the negotiations even after we delivered on the settlement freeze.

Whats striking, again, is what Clinton leaves out. The settlement freeze was indeed, unprecedented. Unfortunately, it didnt actually freeze settlement growth. Its not just that, as Clinton admits, the freeze exempted East Jerusalem. Even more importantly, it exempted buildings on which construction had all ready begun. This loophole proved crucial because, as the Israeli press reported at the time, settlers spent the months preceding the freeze feverishly breaking ground on new construction, on which they continued to build during the ten month freeze, before breaking new ground once it expired. As a result, according to Peace Now, there was more new settlement construction in 2010 - the year of the freeze - than in 2008. As Obama administration envoy George Mitchell admitted to Palestinian negotiator Saab Erekat, the Obama administration had wanted a freeze that truly stopped settlement growth but we failed.

Clintons claim that Abbas refused to negotiate until the last minute is disingenuous too. In fact, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met repeatedly during the freeze. In January 2010, just over a month after it began, veteran Israeli columnist Ben Caspit reported that, In the past weeks, Israeli representatives, including Netanyahu, have repeatedly rejected official documents that their Palestinian counterparts have tried to submit to them, with details of the Palestinian positions on all the core issues. The Israeli representatives are completely unwilling to discuss, read or touch these documents, not to speak of submitting an equivalent Israeli document with the Israeli positions.

While reporting my book, The Crisis of Zionism, I heard four different Obama officials confirm this account. During the settlement freeze, the Palestinians submitted to Netanyahu and his aides the same positions they had submitted to Netanyahus predecessor, Ehud Olmert. These included a Palestinian state on the 1967 lines with a 1.9 percent land swap for territory inside Israel proper, Israeli control of all the Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem, international troops in the Jordan Valley and the return of 150,000 Palestinian refugees over ten years. The Netanyahu government, by contrast, steadfastly refused to discuss the parameters of a Palestinian state.

In her interview with Goldberg, Clinton never mentions that.

Netanyahus views on Palestinian statehood resembled Ehud Baraks.

Given the evidence that during her time as secretary of state, Bibi refused to discuss territory, Clintons claim that I saw Netanyahu move from being against the two-state solution toconsidering all kinds of Barak-like options is bizarre. Whatever you think of Ehud Baraks offer at Camp David in July 2000, it was a detailed offer. Netanyahu, by contrast, refused put forward a territorial proposal not merely during Clintons term, but during John Kerrys far more aggressive effort to broker a deal. During the Kerry negotiations, according to Haaretzs Barak Ravid, Netanyahu flatly refused to present a map or even to discuss the subject theoreticallythroughout the nine months of the talks Netanyahu did not give the slightest hint about the scale of the territorial concessions he would be willing to make.

Its too bad Goldberg didnt press Clinton on what kind of Barak-like options she heard Netanyahu propose, because the best reporting we have suggests he offered no territorial options at all.

Netanyahu is right to demand indefinite control of the West Bank

 














  you're promoting division based on religion.

I think Israel beat us to that one. 




  Jews so special that they're the only nation on earth that isn't allowed to have their own country

The Jews aren't a nation.  They're a religious group.

When religions have their own country, well, we have a word for that.  Pakistan can call itself the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, but it's not recognized as such, rather only as the Republic of Pakistan.  

Official religions and privileged classes are the perfect recipe for failure, such is the case, as we have seen, with Israel. 




 An Israeli Hasbara tactic - frightening your critics into silence. 









 TL;DR.  Without any irony, a Conservative accuses the left of not thinking.

 The whites in South Africa worried about the same thing. 



















 lol 




 The followers of bin Laden are smart enough to know that a military budget requires provisions for both offense and defense.  Funding for defense is in the end a line item on the plus side of the balance sheet, which leaves more room in the budget for weapons.  

It really doesn't matter if you or I see it another way.  The enemies of Israel see us supporting them, and they hate us for it.  If the US were to give $225M for a Palestinian Iron dome too, it would be a different matter. 




  If an ancestors land ownership constitutes the right for a descendent to own it, then the Jews are the oldest group today that can trace itself back to ancient Israel.

 1) Premise/Assumption: Original ownership of land passes to children/grandchildren/so-on.

The Palestinians are the Canaanites who predated the Jews.  

Conclusion:  Palestinians have a claim to ownership of Palestine.

 2) Premise/Assumption: Whoever currently controls a land is the owner.

If that were the case, there should have never been pressure to rid South Africa of its racist regime.  

This premise isn't accepted.

Israel is a defacto Apartheid system, imposed only very recently, and the cause of great instability in the region.  

 3) Premise/Assumption: Controlling a land for 25/50/75/100/200/300/400/ years means that it becomes your land, until another group can hold that land for 25/50/75/100/200/300/400 years.

Again, see the answer to 2).  That is what we are here to discuss.  Land rights.  The Israelis obtained theirs by displacing the people who had lived there for centuries, which is the direct cause for the current problems in the region.  

 




 Why? 




 Truly idiotic. 




 They're only human shields if Israel won't fire on these areas - but Israel *is* willing to fire on these areas, so they're not human shields.

A better explanation is that Hamas militants are using the buildings as cover.  What we can conclude is that *both* Israel and Hamas don't care about civilian casualties. 




 Both historically and recently, they have the antecedent claim to the land.   




 from [Osama bin Laden's 'letter to America'](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/24/theobserver )

 (Q1) Why are we fighting and opposing you? 

 (1) Because you attacked us and continue to attack us.

 a) You attacked us in Palestine:

 (i) Palestine, which has sunk under military occupation for more than 80 years. The British handed over Palestine, with your help and your support, to the Jews, who have occupied it for more than 50 years; years overflowing with oppression, tyranny, crimes, killing, expulsion, destruction and devastation. The creation and continuation of Israel is one of the greatest crimes, and you are the leaders of its criminals. And of course there is no need to explain and prove the degree of American support for Israel. The creation of Israel is a crime which must be erased. Each and every person whose hands have become polluted in the contribution towards this crime must pay its*price, and pay for it heavily.

 (Q2) What are we calling you to, and what do we want from you?

 The American people are the ones who pay the taxes which fund the planes that bomb us in Afghanistan, the tanks that strike and destroy our homes in Palestine, the armies which occupy our lands in the Arabian Gulf, and the fleets which ensure the blockade of Iraq. These tax dollars are given to Israel for it to continue to attack us and penetrate our lands. So the American people are the ones who fund the attacks against us, and they are the ones who oversee the expenditure of these monies in the way they wish, through their elected candidates. 









 You realize that only a few decades ago, terrorist attacks against Americans were completely unthinkable.  That was before our interventionist foreign policy, and when we were seen as a neutral broker in the Middle East.

 What you're advocating is giving money directly to the .001%.  That will line their pockets, not help everyone else.  Corporations aren't struggling because there isn't capital floating around.  Remember the billions that we gave to the banks?  Or all that money that rich people already have?  

The problem is that regular people don't have money.  Giving it straight to corporations is just going to make things worse.

 




 That is really depressing.  If she sincerely believes in it, that's almost enough to make me write her off.  I hope this is just a political calculation.

So for now, I'm going to assume this is a matter of picking battles.

 The presence of Israel on the holy sites is one of the prime recruiting reasons for radical Islamists.  

The bigger problem is that the US wants control of the region.  Israel is out proxy there.  And that's the reason OP's post will only be a wild pipe dream - that is, until regional oil supplies are no longer important. 









 That's why the blockade has been condemned by the UN and several human rights organizations.  But, in the Orwellian world of the hasbara activist, the Israeli imposed Palestinian "diet" is a great, generous humanitarian act.  

Good grief. 




 The check for your hasbara services is in the mail. 




 I have no idea what any of this is about.   









  Hamass can stop hiding among and behind women and children any time they want, but they do not. 

Hamas has been accused of using human shields, but this only works if the opponent cares about civilian casualties.  Obviously, Israel does not.  

 Hamas bears much of the blame for this violence. They have been preparing for it for some time given the complexity of tunnel networks.

Is see, some of the individuals of the open air prison have rebelled.  Since we've already accepted that collective punishment is an acceptable approach, might as well kill prisoners arbitrarily, right, whether they were involved or not.  Hopefully they will learn to cower before their masters,  the thieves who stole their ancestral properties, once enough of their children are dead.   

 They were elected to lead, and instead of building schools, infrastructure, and bettering the lives of civilians; they build missiles, bombs, suicide vests, and tunnels.

LOL.  Let's ignore the fact that the Israeli government blocked supplies to the open air prison after Hamas won the vote, right?  Or as that senior Israeli official described it:  "**[The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dov_Weissglass )**"

Fucking evil genocidal sacks of shit.  But the world is starting to learn the truth, despite the best efforts at selective story-telling by the hasbara brigade.  Israel is being seen for what it is - the Nazi's Frankenstein monster - and world public opinion is repudiating it.   




 Responding by killing over a thousand Palestinians = "getting a pass".

  The Shah of Iran hates us for our actions in 1953, nothing to do with Israel. 

The Shah of Iran, Reza Pahlavi, was a close ally of the United States.  His secret police, SAVAK, were notorious for disappearing and torturing his opponents.

[Saddam was a US ally, as was Osama bin Laden.](http://www.juancole.com/2005/08/fisking-war-on-terror-once-upon-time.html )

The point is that our support for Israel is just one aspect of our  meddling in the Middle East.  It has produced negative consequences for us.  At one time, it was unthinkable that the US would be the target of terrorist attacks.  It was seen as a fair and unbiased actor in the region.  However, after years of self-interested intervention, as the CIA warned, we're experiencing blowback.

**EDIT** grammar 




 Our support over the years of Israel and other brutal regimes in the region - Shah of Iran, Saddam, the Saudi dictatorship - is the #1 reason cited by leaders of anti-US groups like Al Qaeda for their actions against us. 

I think you're vastly underestimating the cost of our support for Israel. 




 As a Canadian, I second the sentiment.

  We also did a "regime change" in Serbia/Kosovo, and there's not "brutal chaos" there.

That is a valid argument.

 It's no small coincidence that the US is more active in more volatile parts of the world and that volatile parts of the world are more likely to descend into chaos.

1. But if the US tends not to be successful in interventions, we should tend not waste blood and treasure by intervening.
2. In some of the cases (e.g., Iraq), the regions are unstable because of previous US interference (i.e., CIA/Mossadegh).

logical fallacy

**EDIT** For all the down voters - do you understand what a [logical fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_fallacy ) is?

This argument has the structure:

1. ALL P ARE Q

2. Q

3. THEREFORE Q MUST BE A P

4. BUT Q IS NOT A P, THEREFORE (1) IS FALSE

I.e.,  an invalid argument - a classical logical fallacy.

Translating, Sleekery is arguing:

1. All countries which the US regime changed (P) are countries which descended into chaos (Q)

2. Syria descended into chaos

3. Therefore Syria must be a country which the US invaded

4. But Syria wasn't invaded by the US, therefore (1) must be false...

An invalid argument.

 I don't believe that the entire Progressive caucus supports this, rather I read this as abject cowardice. AIPAC has a stranglehold over our politics, and even the most stalwart progressives can't say a peep about it.

 No, I agree that is pretty clearly biased. 

Yet, a lot of this article rung true to me.  I think Clinton, if elected President, will be a disaster for progressives.  I've heard nothing out of her mouth that I believe.  Even when she talked about income inequality recently at the Aspen Ideas conference, it sounded like she was bullshitting.  She so carefully couched her words that it seemed like a nod and a wink to her fellow globalists: "just what the proles want to hear, don't you know".  That has been my impression, anyway.

 "Spitzer". 




  Hobby Lobby did not object to covering typical "birth control," and, if I'm reading this decision correctly, is not exempt from covering combined oral contraceptives (i.e., the medication that nigh everyone thinks of when you say "birth control").

 To that end, I'm sorry to say, I think Sen. Warren is being disingenuous, as is any reporter/opinion writer that implies that this case applies to a broader scope than written.

You are wrong:  [the SCOTUS clarified *the very next day* that the decision applies broadly to the entire contraceptive mandate, not just the handful of methods that Hobby Lobby objected to](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/scotus-says-hobby-lobby-ruling-applies-broadly ).  

Even without this, why would you think Warren is being disingenuous when she is merely echoing the ideas in Ginsburg's dissent?  We should be thankful for her voice on this issue. 

 The privately traded company Hobby Lobby is wholly owned by devoutly religious peoples, and therefore should have access to the same exemptions as other religious employers.

Under this theory, companies owned by religious people are indistinguishable from religious institutions, so shouldn't have to pay any tax at all.  But that is obviously false.  Religious institutions and charities are categorically different from corporate employers, which is why we treat them as such everywhere in US law.   HSS did not open the door to anything.







 




 What exactly are you remembering?  Obama was an extremely lackluster Senator. [An assessment by 7 liberal interest groups ranked him as among the least liberal"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_career_of_Barack_Obama#Legislation_and_voting_record ).  Warren is already a huge force in the Senate - so much so that some progressives mistakenly argue that "we need her to continue doing what she's doing in the Senate".  Not so for Obama, that's for sure -- what exactly did he do?  

I remember quite well because a very close friend of mine was an ardent supporter of his.  At that time, I was following Obama's record quite closely.  And another friend, an African-American lawyer who was at Harvard Law a few years after Obama,  also followed his career closely.  There was *very* little in the way of actual legislative achievements to indicate his governing style.  The one thing of note was that Obama would do a good job of explaining each side's arguments - at Harvard Law school and in Illinois - and that was his great strength, expressing the interests of both sides of the argument.  His whole life has been about playing the middle.  If you think he was some great success in the Senate, you ought to supply some data.

  




 Right - it has nothing to do with Eric Holder putting [this asshole](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/03/29/lanny-breuer-and-the-immorality-of-our-morality.html) in charge of bank fraud:

 Breuer expressed his prosecutorial philosophy thus: "In reaching every charging decision, we must take into account the effect of an indictment on innocent employees and shareholders," Breuer said. "Those are the kinds of considerations in white-collar crime cases that literally keep me up at night and which must play a role in responsible enforcement."

... before he left for a $4M a year job working for banks.
 




 The problem is people weren't paying attention: telecom immunity, supporting Joe Lieberman over Ned Lamont, "Reagan is the model president", and "American needs bipartisanship" - were all pretty clear signals about what kind of President Obama was going to be.

Warren has been spent her whole career actually  fighting for the issues she's stumping about.  Not so Obama. 




 Who is Eliot? 




 What's annoying is that people aren't paying attention to the details.  Obama's message was that bipartisanship was the answer, and Reagan was the president he'd emulate.  Warren has been writing and testifying about income inequality from before she got into politics. 




 Obama has governed very conservatively, and there was every indication he was going to do that in the primaries.  Not so for Warren. 




  You're 100% right, Warren does not have an outstanding voting record (just like Obama).

This is totally wrong. 




 Obama had no track record of doing anything progressive.  His core message was about bipartisanship ("one America, not two", remember?) - this is why I was never a fan of his.  He showed he was a conservative during the primaries -- he supported telecom immunity; supported Joe Lieberman over the excellent progressive, Ned Lamont; praised Reagan as a model president; there were several actions like this that showed he would govern as a conservative.  He even stated that his supporters ascribed their own politics to him, though he was more conservative than they thought.

But... you have to pay attention to the details.  If you don't, you're likely to reach the conclusion that "everything is the same".  But it's not - what did Obama actually achieve before he was elected?  Nothing.  What did he actually fight for?  Nothing - he gave a pretty speech at the convention about the need for bipartisanship.  It was clear what we were electing. 




 We ended up coding Twitter/FB shares using just the libraries provided by them/iOS Apis  




 I spent so much time trying to get ShareKit to work - it's really a huge disaster.  The approach seems to be super-aggressive on releasing auth credentials.  What this means is, if you rely on Facebook auth as a means for being logged in to your own app, simply by doing a ShareKit share, the user can be logged out of your own app  

I tried pointing this out to the maintainers, and issued patches, but they didn't accept them.  There are several other problems.  Even though it seems to have a lot of integrations, it's really not worth the trouble, in my experience.   




 [Ginsburg talks about exactly this issue in her dissent.] (http://www.newsday.com/opinion/columnists/anne-michaud/the-murky-hobby-lobby-decision-anne-michaud-1.8823229) Hobby Lobby is refusing to pay for IUDs, which can cost a month's wages.  Ginsburg argues that the employers are effectively *preventing* any use of that form of birth control for their employees.  

If members of SCOTUS are saying this, I think Warren is on pretty solid ground.

On another note, it seems that progressives have been fighting losing battles when they second guess themselves and pull their punches.  I'd say that the complaints you have against her are exactly the reason she's ought to lead the party --- she puts the progressive argument on an offensive stance.  (And she's right).  That's how we're going to win battles going forward, not hedging and qualifying things as though we're in philosophy class.

Obama's picks in those posts have dropped the ball.  Warren has brought legislation and publicly shamed the regulators.  What else can she do in her position? 




 It would be much better if everyone were quiet and let both parties do the bidding of Wall Street in peace, right?   Good thinking!

 Are you saying that monopsonies are ok?  It's uncontroversial (i.e., it's taught in first year economics) that monopsonies don't allocate resources efficiently.  Here's a [primer](http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd c=dsp k=monopsony,+efficiency ).

 




 He addresses that, doesn't he?

 Which brings us back to the key question. Dont tell me that Amazon is giving consumers what they want, or that it has earned its position. What matters is whether it has too much power, and is abusing that power. Well, it does, and it is. 



















 [Krugman talks about that here](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/opinion/krugman-not-enough-inflation.html):

 Why is low inflation a problem? One answer is that it discourages borrowing and spending and encourages sitting on cash. Since our biggest economic problem is an overall lack of demand, falling inflation makes that problem worse.

 Low inflation also makes it harder to pay down debt, worsening the private-sector debt troubles that are a main reason overall demand is too low.

 **So why is inflation falling? The answer is the economys persistent weakness, which keeps workers from bargaining for higher wages and forces many businesses to cut prices.** And if you think about it for a minute, you realize that this is a vicious circle, in which a weak economy leads to too-low inflation, which perpetuates the economys weakness.

 




 Warren is arguably one of them.  Not sure how much progress she can make by herself.  The conversation needs to change.  I think that's what she's trying to force the Ds to do.  (Focus on core economic issues, not distract people with social ones, like the Clintons/Obama). 




 Which would include almost all Republicans and Democrats, and certainly our soon-to-be Queen Hillary. 




 Because Republicans don't want to talk about [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2jrpsa/this_year_an_analysis_by_the_new_york_times_shows/ ). 




 The [original paper](http://www.bostonfed.org/inequality2014/papers/reeves-sawhill.pdf ) has much better data (see Figures 10   11).  This chart the WaPo concocted is meaningless and poorly interpreted. 

 




 Yeh, it's pretty clear that both parties are doing it.  The Democrats have been taken over by carpet bagging globalists like the Clintons who get the votes of the rank-and-file by pushing left wing social issues.  The Republicans have always catered to the rich and sell their message using (now discredited) trickle down economics and right wing social issues.

So it could be argued that Warren is incorrect and just banging the partisan drums.  However, an alternative view  is that she's repositioning and rebranding the Democratic party - away from the ideas of Clinton/Obama and towards *economic* left wing issues.  Speeches like this make it harder for Clinton to maneuver.  If Democrats are supposed to be unrigging the system, it'll make it uncomfortable for Clinton to say things like ["lobbyists are people too"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaAkcXynqLA).  

The question is - could Warren just be honest and start attacking half the Democratic party as out of touch and beholden to Wall Street interests?  That would be the truth.  Why did Obama keep the roster of Rubinites and banker-apologists in power at Justice, the SEC and Treasury?   We already know that Warren dislikes them - she's been directly opposed to many of the policies they've instituted.  

There are essentially two choices: call out conservative Democrats and split the party in two, or attract a following and side line them.  Warren is clearly choosing the latter, and I think it's the right choice.  Nader, as much as I agree with him, took the first road, and look where that got him. 



















 The mishmash graphic that WaPo created and what they're trying to assert is in fact wrong, as you point out... which makes the title (sorry, verbatim copy) wrong as well.

However, take a look at the [original paper](http://www.bostonfed.org/inequality2014/papers/reeves-sawhill.pdf), and a couple of the key charts:

* [High school dropout 40-year income quintile versus income quintile at birth]( http://i.imgur.com/N8KCdUM.png)

* [College grad 40-year income quintile versus income quintile at birth](http://i.imgur.com/WUaCyEE.png)

 




 [Original paper](http://www.bostonfed.org/inequality2014/papers/reeves-sawhill.pdf).

[High school dropout 40-year income quintile versus income quintile at birth]( http://i.imgur.com/N8KCdUM.png)

[College grad 40-year income quintile versus income quintile at birth](http://i.imgur.com/WUaCyEE.png) 









 You know what, I think you are reading the graphic correctly and I was reading it incorrectly.  So, it's true that poor college grads end up in the top two quintiles 40% of the time, whereas rich drop outs end up in the top two quintiles 19% of the time.  

Why the hell did they include the left axis?  That is so damn confusing.

But as I said, this is a terrible comparison anyway.  The actual published charts tell the story much more clearly.  It's hard to argue with Figures [10](http://i.imgur.com/N8KCdUM.png) and [11](http://i.imgur.com/WUaCyEE.png).  

Poor drop outs are 3.4 times more likely to end up in the bottom quintile (Figure 10).  Meanwhile, poor college grads are just over half as likely to end up in the top quintile compared to rich college grads.  That doesn't sound like a meritocracy, does it?

 




 **EDIT** Realized I'm *totally* wrong about this.  See [my comment later in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/2josjx/poor_kids_who_do_everything_right_dont_do_better/cldtuef ).

- - - - - -
That commenter has simply misread the graphic. Specifically 19% of rich high school dropouts are not in the top **40%** (as claimed), rather *they are in the top* **20%**.  

On top of this, only 20% of poor college grads make it to the top 20%.  

I.e., *a rich high school dropout has as much of a chance of getting to the top 20% as a poor guy who slogged through college.*

Now, I'll grant that this is a pretty crappy chart, but it seems to have been cobbled together by WaPo.  For a more informative view of the data, take a look at [figures 10](http://i.imgur.com/N8KCdUM.png ) and [figure 11](http://i.imgur.com/WUaCyEE.png ) in [the original paper](http://www.bostonfed.org/inequality2014/papers/reeves-sawhill.pdf ).

Pretty clearly, being a rich goof is better than being a diligent poor.

 **Submission Statement**

This is an interview with the author of a new book on the food industry: "The Spam Factory's Dirty Secret".  Although this doesn't go into depth on the origins of the disease the factory workers experience, it made me wonder --- could this be a porcine-form of Creutzfeld-Jakob/bovine spongiform encephelopathy aka mad cow disease?  It's horrifying that this might be transmitted through the misty of brain particles the workers are exposed to on a daily basis. 









 Au contraire - in fact, the author is quite liberal, and once wrote a column which appeared in WaPo during the Bush years called "White House Watch".  It so pissed off the Neocon editorial staff there that [the WaPo ombudsman was forced to address the controversy](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/10/AR2005121000938.html ):

 PS; DR. 




 The title says "separate system", but my actual proposal is only for a special prosecutor.   That's a well-accepted way of dealing with conflict-of-interest situations in our judicial system. 




 You should read beyond the title. 




 Point taken.  See my edit in the self post. 




 **EDIT** [madronedorf](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/2ijqtx/there_needs_to_be_a_separate_system_of_justice/cl2vauy ) points out I did a pretty crappy job with the title.  I should have written **"There needs to be a special prosecutor for police misconduct"**.

---
The outcome many expected - [no charges for anyone in the SWAT team that blew a hole in a baby with a flash bang](http://www.ajc.com/news/news/breaking-news/no-charges-for-officers-in-botched-drug-raid-that-/nhc2N/?__federated=1 ) - has come to pass.  I know many people are angry seeing cops commit horrific crimes and get away with no charges again and again.  Yet, though this issue is  finally starting to get coverage in the wider media, few speak about one of the most obvious causes of the problem.

Our current system requires that police are prosecuted by people who are essentially their colleagues.  Prosecutors rely on the testimony and cooperation of the police, so they have a strong motivation, if they want success and good relations with them in the future, to find reasons not to prosecute what are obviously crimes.  This   conflict of interest, has resulted in a lack of accountability which has allowed police culture to evolve in an increasingly violent direction.

Police brutality is a symptom of a structural problem.  Getting angry and demanding an end to bad police behavior, or demanding that police be prosecuted for one or another particularly horrendous beating, torture or murder won't solve the problem in the future.  We can't demand that the special relationship between prosecutors and police just magically go away.  It can't if they are to be effective at doing their jobs.  

The only solution, it seems, is to delegate independent prosecutors who are tasked solely with prosecuting police.  What do you think of this? Is there enough work for each state to have their own police prosecutor, or are there reasons for this function to be kept at the Federal level.  Who would this office report to to avoid political pressure being used to neuter the office?

 Signing statements are but one aspect of executive power.

But still, I am wrong and you are right.  Obama has used executive *orders* less than Bush.  

Yet, EOs have been declining steadily since at least Jimmy Carter (contrary to what all of us  in this thread probably suspected):  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/07/10/how-obama-has-used-executive-powers-compared-to-his-predecessors/
 




  hey say "oh, the last person did it, so our guy can do it!" that's not how justice works.

I could not agree more.  I've totally lost respect for Ds who went silent on Obama after criticizing Bush on the exact same issues.  

 I agree, but i honestly think it's both sides

On issues of secrecy, surveillance and executive power, both sides are equally bad.  Obama is arguably worse on all of these issues, having expanded the Cheney doctrine (which the Neocons have gleefully complimented him on).  However, if we're talking about economic issues, the Democrats are very slightly better.    If we're talking about social issues, the Democrats win hands down.  If we're talking about the base, the Democrats have a feeble bunch of half-hearted partisans who are largely rational and have most of the very tiny number of rational unbiased voters, whereas the Republicans have a bunch of super passionate batshit-crazy partisans.  









 Actually, I agree, he's pretty bad, even worse than Bush on some issues (executive power, surveillance, at al).  But boy are conservative complainers a bunch of hypocrites. 









 A quick guide to the Obama scandals:
http://i.imgur.com/aWqDFPZ.jpg 




 OMG that video was excellent.  Now I understand. 




 Honestly cannot tell whether sarcasm or actual wingnut rant.
 




 Terrific analysis.  I hadn't heard that before. 




 I know some like that too, and don't have a ton of sympathy for them.  But I think it's important to look at the big picture.  At the macro level  the middle class is working harder, longer hours, being more productive, and getting paid less.  George Bush said it well when [he complimented a woman on having 3 jobs]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIjo-dWE1Jg ).  "That is uniquely American, isn't it?"

Well, the truth is that it's the *modern* American condition, what we've been left with - two parents having to work just to make ends meet - while the tiny sliver at the top take all the societal gains.. Those few at the top with vast wealth, much of it inherited, can fail their way through life and still land on top because of the structure of modern capitalism.  Owning capital means you get rewarded with profit on work someone else did.  And our society is increasingly becoming one where it pays better to own than work.   




 Thank you so much for that.  This was driving me bananas. 




 Thank you for that response. Could you elaborate on Krugman saying individuals ought not to own capital? I've never heard that from him... honestly, that would surprise me a bit.

I read the Murphy piece, but I'm a bit skeptical.  He seems to be driving at his conclusions because he's upset at Piketty's conclusions, not because of analysis.  Giles, on the other hand, certainly seemed to have an analysis.  I thought his conclusions were pretty damning when they came out, but they have since been pretty thoroughly and humiliatingly debunked (even by the very authors he quoted).  The other main criticism is that Piketty got depreciation rates wrong, but Delong deals with that issue [here](http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2014/06/over-at-equitable-growth-depreciation-rates-on-wealth-in-thomas-pikettys-database-monday-focus-june-9-2014.html ). 




 While I agree with you on the micro-scale, at the macro scale we're facing  an economy of increasing automation, which is obviating the need for jobs.  CPG Grey made a good video that explains: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU.  The only people that stand to win in such an economy are the ones who own the robots, so to speak.  We're seeing the beginnings of this transition today.  

As labor becomes unnecessary, the bargaining power of workers falls.  People aren't lazier than they were before -- they're more productive, work longer hours, have poorer health, and less free time -- but they get paid less.  The richest family in America can pay workers so little they have to rely on government assistance to get by, at the same time their company makes vast profits.  Such is the benefit of inherited wealth.

In the world we're moving into, those  who own the means of production and distribution have increasingly greater bargaining power and extract more value from labor contracts.  Workers work harder, produce goods more efficiently, and because of their efficiency put themselves out of jobs, and because of their weaker bargaining power,  share in less and less of the wealth.  

This mirrors the finding of Piketty et al., who I'm sure you've heard of if you are hanging out on Reddit frequently.  His work conclusively demonstrates that in aggregate, and increasingly so, you become wealthier simply by owning capital, whereas on average you become poorer if your income derives primarily from doing work.

 I don't think it's just a matter of moving the debate to the left.  Hillary will tell people what they want to hear (like Obama did), and then govern like the carpetbagging globalist she is.  We someone who is going to represent the issues of regular people like Sanders or Warren.  Anything else is a failure. 




 What he's doing is establishing the grounds for debate: here are the important issues, this is what the American people care about.  He needs to make that message ring clear, then he can go in and dismantle her during the debates and the main campaign.

If he attacks her too soon, he's tacitly acknowledging her leadership status in the race (even though she hasn't announced), which gives her some free credibility.  And if he attacks now without establishing the grounds for debate, he'll do so from a weaker position, and will run the risk of inoculating her from those arguments later in the campaign. 



















 See my reply [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2fwktm/senator_elizabeth_warren_delivered_a_speech_on/ckdoy3a ). 




 Yet, SCOTUS ruled that the government also has an interest in safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process.  The Constitution has conflicting goals which need to be balanced with one another.  The purpose of these amendments is to preserve a government by and of the people.   Yet, as we know from the recent Princeton study, the US is now effectively an oligarchy. 

So some balance is needed.  It won't come from the Supreme Court, which is the most corporate-friendly in history, which has overturned precedent and rejected the laws which our *elected representatives* have passed.  Their actions have made a new amendment necessary.
 









 First amendment?    

 "While money is used to finance speech, [money is not speech](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/former-justice-stevens-campaign-money-isnt-speech/ ) . Speech is only one of the activities that are financed by campaign contributions and expenditures. Those financial activities should not receive precisely the same constitutional protections as speech itself,. After all, campaign funds were used to finance the Watergate burglary, actions that clearly were not protected by the First Amendment."

 That code was a joke, but, having worked on several different reasoning systems, I don't see how any of them could ever be considered conscious.   

 No not at all, considering we are a few pounds of soft grey spongy material. 

But it's not clear what kind of physics is going on in there.  (And no, I don't believe in Hameroff's microtubule nonsense).  

What is clear, however, is that any of the most sophisticated AI reasoners that you could run on the fastest digital computer around today could also run on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40DkJ9vt5CI (Please watch) - where the physics is clear, and obviously doesn't invoke consciousness.  To say that thing is conscious just doesn't pass the giggle test.  

Have you read Chalmer's essay on the  [Hard and Easy problem](http://consc.net/papers/facing.html )? 




  Still, this is kind of how research works, people have experimented on animals capable of pain, even giving rats cancer to find ways of treating cancer, in the long run that benefits humanity.

But computers aren't conscious. 




 Here's an AI that's begging you to stop experimenting on it:

    def do_experiment():
        print("Please stop experimenting on me.")

     do_experiment()
    Please stop experimenting on me.


The question revolves around whether it is possible to hurt an AI and whether AIs have any subjective sensation.  I think we can agree that in the above case it doesn't.  So the real question is, when does an AI experience anything?  

The things that we call computers today are Turing equivalent.  That is, any one device could simulate any other Turing-equivalent device.  That means that [a machine like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40DkJ9vt5CI) could, given enough time (and tape), run any fancy AI program we dream up.  I think it strains credibility to think such a machine could ever be conscious, or that we should ever care about its suffering.  Don't you agree?

 "If only they would comply with the ethnic cleansing program." 




 So satisfying.  Thanks.  Funnily enough, I just posted yesterday about [UCLA's mechanical calculator](http://vimeo.com/70589461 ). 














 The machine's states are governed by the positions of the white flaps that are attached to a bar at the top of the machine.  Call this the "state bar".  Balls collected from the front are dropped onto the state bar.  If the bar drops onto a state flap, it rotates the bar, effectively changing the state.

Notice that the ball is picked up from one of 5 positions in front of the machine.  Each of these positions represents a Symbol; call them B1...B5.  When a ball is picked up from position ***i***, it is dropped onto the state flap in position ***i***.  Depending on the position of the state bar, the flap at position ***i*** may be in the way.  If the bar has 2 rotational positions, then the machine has 2 states, which we'll call S1 and S2. 

Thus, the rules are encoded by positioning flaps at positions 1,2,3,4,5 (corresponding to symbols B1...B5).

E.g.,

| states/positions | 1 | 2  |  3 |  4 |  5 |
| ----------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: |
|  S1  | 0 | 1  |  0 |  1 |  0 |
|  S2  | 1 | 0  |  1 |  0 |  1 |

In this rule system, B2 and B4 cause S1-S2 transition whereas B1,B3 and B5 cause S2-S1.

This is just an example of how to write  rules.   (I'm not making any claims about whether this is Turing complete.)


 




 Watch the whole video. 









 Here's an actual mechanical Turing machine (bonus points: no electricity required!).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40DkJ9vt5CI#t=13 














 It looks like a continuous mechanical calculator, doesn't it? 









 There is no agency. A computer is a simple mechanism, and can be implemented using very different components:

  * electronic (the kind you're using now)
  * [mechanical](http://hackaday.com/2011/03/25/mechanical-turing-machine-can-compute-anything-slowly/ )
  * [water and valves](http://www.inquisition.ca/en/info/artic/ordineau.htm )
  
When arranged in the right way, such parts can "compute" when a motor is run.  In the case of electronic computers, the motor is an electronic clock which causes the computer to advance from one step of a computation to another.  For a mechanical computer, a real motor does the job.  

In fact, it doesn't matter what the parts are -- computers are said to be "equivalent" to each other --- i.e., any program you can describe in the most sophisticated modern electronic computer could be run (albeit slowly) on a mechanical or water-valve-based computer.  

Think of a computer as a player piano which interprets a line of the piano roll differently depending on what keys are currently pressed, and which is capable of modifying the roll (adding or deleting holes) and moving it back and forth.  The only thing that is required is an external source of energy to drive it through its paces.  As I said above, in a modern computer, an electronic clock plays this role of stepping transistors through their paces, but the principle is the same.

The mathematician Alan Turing described the first general purpose computer, and that machine was capable of doing all of the computations of any modern day computer. Checkout the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40DkJ9vt5CI#t=13 ) in the "mechanical" link above.  Just pause and soak that in for a moment - that primitive device (given enough tape) is capable of doing any computation your fancy 2014 laptop is.

For that reason we call general purpose computers "Turing-complete".  They are all equivalent to each other in terms of the computations they can do. The only difference is that modern ones are smaller and faster, and have better input-output capabilities.  But  from a mathematical perspective, Turing's original "a-machine" was just as powerful.  In fact, the Turing machine in the video is capable of *simulating* the CPU in your laptop.  Pretty mind-blowing, huh?

Turing's machine was based on a pretty simple mechanism which had 6 states and wrote 2 symbols.  Yet, [even simpler mechanisms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram%27s_2-state_3-symbol_Turing_machine ) have been described.  So Turing completeness is pretty easy to create.  People have even created Turing-complete computers inside virtual worlds [like Minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X21HQphy6I ).   Given enough memory and time, they're just as capable as the most powerful super computer available today.

So how to computers appear to think and have agency?  All the magic happens in programs. Programs cause computing machines  to move from state to state and read and write symbols as it does so.  We interpret the output as the results of the computation.  

I highly recommend Martin Davis's  excellent book on the origins of computing called ["The Universal Computer"](http://www.amazon.com/The-Universal-Computer-Leibniz-Turing/dp/0393047857 ) for a great explanation of how questions about the foundations of mathematics gave rise to modern computing.

 No, I think that there's a clear conflict of interest to have prosecutors prosecuting their policeman colleagues, whatever the race of the victim and policeman.   In this case, the black officer got off for the same reason that Darren Wilson did.  In both cases, it needs to stop.  We need to eliminate this glaring conflict of interest.

My comment about "McCulloch, the white colleague of the predominantly white, and at least partly racist, police force" was a retort to captrockwelltorrey, who implied that because McCulloch is a Democrat, that somehow exonerates him of favoring the police officer in the Wilson/Brown case.  I was merely pointing out that while McCulloch might be a Democrat, one could make the (equally non-sequiturial) counter-argument that he's white.  I might have more clearly stated my objection with "WTF does him being a Democrat have to do with anything??"  Anyway, that is what I meant.

    Black: 21.71%

That is racism.  The fact that you aren't convinced says more about your disposition than about the facts.
 




 Because there is a news article documenting each racist cop in Ferguson, right? 




 These statistics demonstrate things pretty convincingly, but I'm sure you'll still be unconvinced.

  and at least partly racist, police force,

[Officer Dan Page](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/08/more-audio-surfaces-dan-page-racist-rant-end-times )


 So your argument here boils down to "Racist white people" and "Conspiracy"?

WTF?

 




 To the contrary, McCulloch, the white colleague of the predominantly white, and at least partly racist, police force, betrayed his role as prosecutor, which is to present a case which argues for trial.  In fact, [almost *all* grand juries decide to indict, except when the defendant is a police officer](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/ferguson-michael-brown-indictment-darren-wilson/ ).  That's not some strange statistical coincidence - it's the expected, obvious outcome when cops are prosecuted by their direct colleagues.   





























 This is true for almost every article on the NYTimes.  Once you reach the limit of articles for the month, you can't read more unless you put your browser in "private" mode.   


Everyone left Slashdot  precisely because of over-zealous moderation, and it's ruining the experience here too. 




 So r/politics has gotten to the point of blocking the NYTimes now too? 




  doesn't that indicate to you - as an attorney - that the evidence that the officer did anything culpably wrong was essentially non-existent?

No.  When the defendant is an officer of the law, grand juries frequently *fail* to indict, unlike what happens with everyone else.  So, what happened in this case is  the rule, not the exception.  Regular people go to court, officers get off:
http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/ferguson-michael-brown-indictment-darren-wilson/ 

The obvious explanation is that the massive conflict of interest in having your colleague frame the case for your grand jury is producing the expected result.  And that's why there's so much furor over this case --- everyone knows that officers aren't accountable to the law.  

 
























 Are Christians more violent than Muslims?  [What do the statistics say?](https://abagond.wordpress.com/2013/04/24/are-christians-more-violent-than-muslims/ ) 









 If I understand correctly, you're proposing to use charitable donations essentially as a form of brand advertising.

The question you should ask is: what are your goals?  Are you trying enhance your brand's reputation?  Or do you need to boost short term sales?  Charity is pretty much guaranteed to perform worse for the second purpose.  As an entrepreneur, you understand that resources are limited, and your route to success depends on getting maximum ROI.  

Are you sure your business is at a point where building brand value is more important than expanding the business or boosting sales?  It all depends on the growth profile of your business, and how much brand value is important, and how much giving to a particular charity can improve that.

If you decide in the affirmative, I'd look at this as a kind of advertising campaign.  Will the charity give your business exposure to the right audience?  Will you get constant exposure, or a one-time promotion?  How many eyeballs will you reach?  Over what time?  What are the demographics of the people who will be exposed to the message about your support?  Will they understand what your company does and why they might be interested in the product?  How will you measure success?  What metric will you use to decide to continue the campaign or not?  How long do you have to run the campaign to see the result?  

Long running brand awareness campaigns, are harder things to measure than more focused forms of advertising.  20% is a healthy chunk of profits - I don't have figures, but I'd hazard a guess that this level of spending on charity is extremely rare.  Why do you think that is?  My guess is that the market is doing ROI calculations - large businesses with excess cash can afford to spend what to them are small amounts to get a large outcome in terms of brand perception.   My guess is that you're running a relatively small business, so you're going to be spending a lot more, and getting less of the charity's promotional efforts.  Probably not a good deal.

Now, there are probably some good counter examples to what I've said - public radio, for instance, but that is a very particular case.  First and foremost, the "charity" is actually a form of media, and has an actual audience, so this kind of spending is very much like a traditional ad buy.  

**TL;DR Don't do it.**

Sorry, man - looks like you're one of those victims of Republican talking points that Gruber is talking about. 




 TIL; the only valid laws are constitutional amendments. 




 No, he said that "the stupidity of the American voter" required that the law be unclear about what insurance actually is.  ANY solvent insurance plan requires that healthy people pay in more than they take out than sick people.  That is what a fucking insurance plan actually *is*.

But since Republicans turn everything into a political issue, even that simple fact which follows from logic is somehow a scandal.  Yes, to Republicans it's a huge scandal.  The rest of the world calls this "insurance".

So, yes, he was right on the money:  people who are swayed by Republican talking points are in fact stupid.

Now I know I'm being trolled.
 




 Part of the standard Obama playbook - make statements placating the base while running a government that does the opposite. 




 Seriously?    The GOP is carrying out the Koch agenda, and their agenda is pretty clear:
http://www.sanders.senate.gov/koch-brothers

  * Repeal of federal campaign finance laws - means that politicians serve the wealthy, and resulting in the US becoming [a de facto oligarchy](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/princeton-experts-say-us-no-longer-democracy ).
  * Reduction of social services, which reduces the bargaining power of labor.  This results in lower wages and workers rights.  
  * Against laws that police corporations, but none focused on reducing policing of regular people.  The result of this kind of policy is that corporate profits and property get state protection, but the freedom and rights of regular people aren't protected.  


Yet, at the same time that conservatives seek special rights and protection for the owners of property, they want to abridge personal freedoms of regular people:

  * DOMA
  * Reagan's War on Drugs (which right wing Dems shamefully perpetuated)
  * Anti-Abortion regulations
  * Anti-athiest laws
  * Anti-union laws: http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/30/g-o-p-platform-seeks-to-weaken-powers-of-unions/?_r=0

The list is so long, it's almost  silly to respond.
 




 Yet, those are the results of conservative policy. 




 Don't worry, we all prefer corporations controlling our lives. 




 **Submission Statement**

A NYTimes piece that goes in depth into the controversy surrounding the Supreme Court's decision to take up the challenge to Obamacare.  In fact, everything from the decision of SCOTUS to take up the case when precedent was largely being set by the lower courts to the details of the specific legal issue itself suggest a truly unprecedented action.  Which the author argues is worse, legally speaking, than what happened in Bush v. Gore. 



















 I mean in this sense - economic egalitarianism is a central concept of classical liberal left libertarianism.  That is, obviously, also a central theme of Warren's politics.  Checkout the entry in Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-libertarianism#Classical_liberal_left-libertarianism.  

 Contemporary left-libertarian scholars such as Hillel Steiner, Peter Vallentyne, Philippe Van Parijs, Michael Otsuka, and David Ellerman root an economic egalitarianism in the classical liberal concepts of self-ownership and appropriation. They hold that it is  for anyone to claim private ownership of natural resources to the detriment of others, a condition John Locke explicated in Two Treatises of Government. Locke argued that natural resources could be appropriated as long doing so satisfies the proviso that there remains "enough, and as good, left in common for others."

Penned by the Directory of Duke's Islamic Studies department, this article talks about the Muslim way of asking how you are doing:

 Kayf haal-ik? or, in Persian, Haal-e shomaa chetoreh? How is your haal?

 What is this haal that you inquire about? It is the transient state of ones heart. In reality, we ask, How is your heart doing at this very moment, at this breath? When I ask, How are you? that is really what I want to know.   









 Agree with everything you say here.

So can the various sides can agree on desired outcomes?  It may be that this just moves the problem to a different place, but I think, it's a more honest approach.  

You suggested "Human flourishing".  That seems like a good starting point that probably both left and right can agree on.  So how would we quantify it?  What would we accept as evidence that one system or another leads to the desired outcome? 









 She's left libertarian, but in America, Libertarian usually refers to the right-wing version. 




 Rights don't have any basis in physical reality - they are just rules that are made up to support a particular way of life. We don't have a right to land ownership anymore than a beaver has a "right" to dam a river.   So talking about rights is essentially meaningless - or a way of forcing agreement through assertion.  Rather than ask what rights people have - because anyone could assert anything, and they have: a right to healthcare, a right to move freely anywhere, a right to enslave. If we insist on basing a discussion on rights, there's no way to get agreement, unless the participants already agree about the same set of rights. It makes a lot more sense to ask what outcomes we'd like to have, and figure out what rules will support that form of life.

 First two paragraphs.  

 *Among the most disturbing political phenomena of our time is the emergence in the newly created state of Israel of the "Freedom Party" (Tnuat Haherut) a political party closely akin in its organization, methods, political philosophy and social appeal to the Nazi and Fascist parties.  It was formed out of the membership and following of the former Irgun Zvai Leumi, a terrorist, right-wing, chauvinist organization in Palestine.*

 The current visit of Menachen Begin, leader of this party, to the United States is obviously calculated to give the impression of American support for his party in the coming Israeli elections, and to cement political ties with conservative Zionist elements in the United States. Several Americans of national repute have lent their names to welcome his visit.  **It is inconceivable that those who oppose fascism throughout the world, if correctly informed as to Mr. Begin's political record and perspectives could add their names and support to the movement he represents.**


So please shut the fuck up.

Good luck with your "trades".  No doubt the government will step in to ensure the solvency of your industry when you geniuses blow up the world again.
 




  The entire reason the right came back in 2010 is because the left began to move, well, left. It was an almost Newtonian response to the agenda of the President.

I think the evidence says the opposite.   Democratic turnout is known to be low during non-Presidential elections, so there's that, but it doesn't account for the particularly low D turnout that year.  *That lack of enthusiasm* is the real story.  It's not that people turned against the Ds.  No one was for them anymore.  And in fact, in the South, it was the Blue Dogs who tacked right trying to placate conservatives who were most thoroughly wiped out.  That at least is something we have to be thankful for.  Good riddance to them and their malign impact on the party.

The fallacy of median voter theory is that there is a middle to appeal to.  There is not.  [The public is more divided than ever.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/06/12/7-things-to-know-about-polarization-in-america/ )  What does exist is a difference in enthusiasm.  Republicans with their constant irrational appeals to fear have a reliable strategy for turning out a dwindling base.  Democrats squander their natural advantage, constantly alienate theirs, and take their failures as reasons to move further right, even as public policy choices lie far to the left on issue after issue.

It's hard to find a one stop shop for data on this, but try googling around yourself.  Look for polls where Americans are assessed for their views on actual public policy issues, not on party preference. 

Here are some from the first page when googling "poll american public policy preferences":

* [This summary](http://theprogressivecynic.com/2014/05/02/is-the-usa-center-right-an-issue-by-issue-breakdown/ ) shows that on issue after issue, Americans are progressive.  

 * They want spending for entitlements and the poor over deficit reduction, left and right both want the wealth distribution to be more equal than it actually is, even as they both underestimate how unequal it actually is.  
 * They support increasing taxes on the wealthy by large margins.  
 * 71% support increasing the minimum wage.
 * vast majorities approve of labor unions
 * a plurality think we spend too much on defense
 * a decisive majority is positioned to the left on voting rights
 * a vast majority wants to legalize marijuana
 

The list goes on and on and.  You should read it.

Milquetoast Democrats like Mondale and Dukakis haven't been able to articulate the issues that public cares about because they've sliced and diced it into tiny issues.  Republicans have a simple marketing message based in fear, religion and nationalism.  Democrats could, but don't articulate what the public actually cares about: economic fairness.  They've followed clueless consultants like Bob Shrum right off the cliff.  

The fact is, that the Democrats have been on the defensive since they abandoned their post as the champions of economic justice.  Until they get back to their traditional stance, the contempt of the public for them and for government in general will only increase - and it will be well deserved. 




 How can I take this guy seriously?  Anyone who opens with a hot headed ad hominem attack is just begging for eyes to roll.

 Just what we need  another economist with ZERO real work experience. The latest economist destined to destroy the world in the same manner as Karl Marx is Thomas Piketty and his new book Capital in the Twenty-First Century that is destined to perhaps kill more people than Marx ever did.

He follows with a  sequence of untestable claims and red baiting that seems like an audition for Fox rather than a serious critique.  This bit made me laugh (emphasis in the original):

  Piketty is only focused on the disparity between rich and poor. He too sees this as evil rather than trying to figure out **HOW** the economy functions. Piketty is off on a quest to control the world and place even more of our rights, privileges, and immunities into the hands of guess who - **government**! 

Sorry, but this essay is written for true believers.  It's not going to convince anyone else.  For example:

 Piketty claims the current level of rising wealth inequality imperils the very future of capitalism. He claims he has proved it with his book  *good one*! 

That is an argument?

And then he offers this sequence of non-sequitors in support:

 He totally fails to even comprehend **HOW** the global economy functions or that John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) in the end admitted his ideas were wrong and that he had hoped that Adam Smiths **Invisible Hand** would save Britain. Here is a picture of Keynes at Bretton Woods discussing how to save the world with government intervention speaking to Roosevelts **Henry Morgenthau, Jr.** (1891- 1967)  Secretary of the Treasury.


Sheesh.  Four paragraphs in and all I've got is apoplectic drivel.  I honestly can't waste my time going any further.  If you can summarize the argument and point to a chart, I'd be happy to look, but this writing is self-discrediting.  It's like the author is on a crusade to portray himself as a biased ideologue.  

Serious criticisms, please.
 




 So does including that data invalidate his findings? And how so?  I'd like to see the analysis.  

I'd love to hear some substantial criticisms, but  glib responses only serve to make me skeptical of the anti-Piketty crowd. 




 USA #1,  folks! 




 Link? 




 The Consulting by RPM review claims "the most obvious problem with Piketty's book is that he wants to make workers poorer, just so long as it will hurt rich capitalists even more."

Seriously?  The author's opinion about what the Piketty's motives are is "most obvious problem"?  The author have spent enough time sneering about progressives and invoking Marx to let us know they've got their ideological fur up.  That they lead with this as their top criticism certainly hints that there's no there there.  

Specifically, both Reisman and Consulting by RPM seem to completely ignore Piketty's main finding: that Capitalism in its normal state leads to a situation where inherited wealth accumulates more quickly than earned wealth, and that after a brief anomolous period, we are now going back to that.  This is the same situation that existed in fin de siecle France - classes became fixed, and merit was not rewarded.  When this is true, the road to wealth starts by being born into it, and it becomes difficult to impossible to change your economic standing through work.

To point to the cool toys that capitalism produces while overlooking the loss of class mobility as the ConsultingByRPM piece does, is not to different from  saying "let them eat cake".  

Finally, the "bombshell blunder" that they report from Chris Giles of FT has been thorough and humiliatingly debunked.  And finally, invoking the far out of mainstream and explicitly anti-empirical Austrians really lays the cards out for all to see. These guys are another bunch of unhappy Libertarian ideologues.  There have got to be better critiques than these. 




 I tried reading the Reisman blog. I couldn't understand whether his specific technical criticisms have merit or not.  He's obviously deeply opposed to Piketty ideologically - he complains about Piketty referencing Marx too much and von Mises, Rothbard et al. too little, for example. He is so hot headed, it's sometimes hard to tell whether there is a valid technical criticism or whether he's just objecting to the conclusions:

 The depths of Pikettys ignorance are such that he believes that capital accumulation not only does not raise real wages but reduces them, by allegedly increasing the share of national income that goes to profits and correspondingly reducing the share that goes to wages, while the overall total of what is produced remains unchanged or increases only very modestly, and then not by virtue of any contribution to production made by capital

He does provide a reference for this, but it's to a file on his local machine, not on the web, so it's impossible to validate. Honestly, it's so hard to get through paragraphs that are filled with this kind of name calling and so poorly supported.  If you're going to call someone an idiot, you better demonstrate this without any doubt, or you risk eroding your own credibility.  Why doesn't he show where Piketty makes the claims he says he does, so we can make up our own mind about it?  Why doesn't he show the mathematics and the specific results that demonstrate Piketty is wrong? Reisman just comes off as an unhappy ideologue.

 




 Ok, that's a start.

Median voter theory is conventional wisdom.  And the Democrats have accepted it without question -- and without test -- for 40 years.  As a result, they've fielded increasingly right wing candidates.  While they've  negotiated themselves to the right of Nixon, Republicans have steadily pushed the Overton window to the right.  

At the same time, these theories *completely* discount actual polling preferences of the American public for the middle.  Healthcare is a good example where poll after poll has shown overwhelming support for both  the public option and outright socialism in the form of universal care. 

Yet, we effectively have two right wing parties.  Is it a surprise that American's opinion of Congress is the lowest it has ever been?  How do the politics of one of America's most popular presidents ever (FDR) fit in today?  Had Republicans followed the median voter theory scolds, we would have a much more liberal country today.  Instead, Democats did, and rightist policies have won. 




 This is what a leader looks like, folks.  We need her or someone like her in 2016, not that carpetbagger from Arkansas. 




 It equally emphasizes that people are pissed off, and of those pissed off people, some are crazy.

 A huge problem with the Bond franchise is keeping it fresh.  Every iteration, you have to avoid it being a cookie cutter operation.  You're basically on the hook for delivering a similar set of tropes:  Go to HQ, chat with Money Penny, Meet with Q, Go on Mission, Meet Girl, Banter with Villain, Go to Villains Layer, Kill villain, Pan out while kissing the girl.  

People howled when blond, blue-eyed Craig was scheduled to take the lead.  The style of Casino Royale totally broke our expectations and shocked us a bit.  The style of Bond, brutal, blue eyed and *coarse* --- not a gentleman at all --- was unexpected, and woke us up.  It was a completely different kind of charisma that carried the show.  And that's why it worked, why it was the one of the best Bonds in decades.

A black bond, especially with an actor with Elba's presence,  opens up a whole new set of possibilities.  There's a whole new style and totally new kinds of interactions that can be explored.  What does it mean when the world's top secret agent is a black guy?  Totally different dynamic.  I'm dying to see what they do with this.   




  Hilary   the Left need to make these conciliatory gestures

To paraphrase one of our Presidents, there's smart conciliation and stupid conciliation.  Let's not do stupid conciliation.  We've had 6 years of that.

It's time for the left to start articulating a real vision.  Hillary's clearly stated goal is to co-opt enough of the left to win so she can continue executing hawkish and neoliberal policies.  Fuck that noise. 




 I.e., we are fucked. 




 She's signaling as clear as any Democrat ever can that she's going to slavishly follow Wall Street's commands. 
























 Gotta love the "But, all our leaders are war criminals"  argument.  'Murca!

 That is a dense paper.  How the WaPo author derived that claim is not obvious to me. 









 The full text I summarized:

 In perhaps the starkest illustration, economists from Harvard University and the University of Chicago wrote in a recent paper that every dollar a worker earns in a research field spills over to make the economy $5 better off. Every dollar a similar worker earns in finance comes with a drain, making the economy 60 cents worse off. 




 **Submission Statement**

Covers recent studies from economists at Harvard, U Chicago et al. on the damage over financialization is doing to our economy.  Instead of being a generalized lament, the article describes some specific measures that demonstrate the point.  For instance, unlike other fields, where technological advancement has led to a decrease in fees, in finance, the opposite has happened.   









 Finally a proper use of all caps.  Strunk   fucking White right here.

 I think describing her as a visionary on inequality only captures a narrow part of why she's important.  Ultimately, Warren is articulating the short-comings of Capitalism itself, and that, arguably is the most critical issue of all today.  In contrast, Gore's focus on climate change is merely narrow and technical, for instance.  Warren's broad critique of a system which is incorrectly calculating value, unfairly distributing resources and harm is an umbrella that includes almost all the other issues that are confronting us. 

Climate change, for example, is a problem of markets not taking into account externalities.  Even police brutality becomes part of the conversation because it is one side of the story of unequal application of justice --- Warren has pointed out how the budget of the rich peoples' police (i.e., Wall Street regulators) was cut, and has talked about how DoJ is viciously prosecuting drug crimes.  It's a short step to also talk about police brutality.  Campaign finance reform is another - rich people are bending the system to their will.  

Warren is tying all the big issues together through by articulating the critical flaw of neoliberalism, which has been the policy of Ds and Rs for the past 40 years.  A system which rewards ownership (by respecting only property rights) does the expected--- it doles out rewards to property owners and pain to the poor.  And that touches climate, justice, financial regulation, foreign policy (though I'm disturbed by her statements on Israel), education, health care and social security --- in short, the whole body of politics.

Democrats have been a slew of mumblers (and I include Gore, whom I have a lot of respect for) --- who've failed to articulate an over arching theme.  Yet, it's been so simple.  They've just been scared to go there because they all bought into the Washington wisdom that you have to unquestioningly worship markets to be "serious".  I think this is why, whether they know it or not, so many people now feel that Warren must be President. 









  That being said, is it justifiable to shut down the entire federal government in protest? Particularly if it comes from the Democratic party, I think that only further legitimates the notion that the government can and should be shuttered in a symbolic protest against a provision that the majority of Congress agrees with.

I resonated with Taibbi's fit of pique, and didn't think too deeply about this.  But your analysis is insightful and hard to disagree with.    The problem, clearly, is Obama and all Blue Dogs.  Perhaps the right action is for progressives to break ranks and start speaking in a clear independent voice, as Warren has.   




  I guess the question is: can Warren open that window back up?

I haven't seen a politician who is so *needed* in over a decade.  Gore was a terrible politician, but a visionary on key issues - internet and climate change.  Warren is a visionary on inequality and is appearing to be a formidable personality.  So, yes, I think there's hope. 




 But what's the point of that?  That's another open ended statement like the first that just throws vague cold water on Warren without adding anything actionable to the conversation.  *Of course* we should focus on actions, so what?  We should also brush our teeth.

And to respond to the specific point, speeches are how politics gets done, and particularly, how populist politics gets done.  Without speeches, all you have are a bunch of insiders doing back-room deals.  Excitement around populist positioning is what gives a politician power to push that position inside the back rooms --- for example in the DPCC, to which she was recently appointed.

Let's keep the discussion specific.  "Warren needs to do ___, ___ and ___.  She said ___, ___ and ___, but didn't do anything.  This is more of the same."  Would be a better starting point. 




 I.e., "Don't trust politicians!"

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromide_(language):

 A bromide is a phrase or platitude that, having been employed excessively, suggests insincerity or a lack of originality in the speaker

 




 I have friends who were fans of his.  One actually went to meet him at his office when he was in Congress a couple of years after his speech at Kerry's convention.  Obama wasn't really a household name at that time, obviously.  

I remember him being excited about some Senator who, he averred, was "onto something good".  The Obama bumper stickers soon followed.  I distinctly recall the sense of disappointment when I found out it was the "One America" speech guy.  That prattle was the toast of Washington, a tone deaf feel good paean that was blind to the radicalism emerging on the right, and which, idiotically, urged compromise.  In this way, his critics are right, he is like Chamberlain.

Obama has done real damage - not only are the inattentive (like ban-chali) now reflexively cynical and disillusioned, he shifted partisan Democratic politics rightward at a time when the country was ready for an FDR, and the base craved one.  In this way, he is not unlike the idol he repeatedly praised, Ronald Reagan.  While the Gipper nudged the American middle to the right, Obama led blind Democratic partisans off the cliff as they defended him on bailouts for banks, torpedoing the public option behind closed doors, whistle blower prosecutions, domestic spying, and lack of accountability for torture and war crimes.

The numb-skulls who were too dense to see the signals back in 2012 and now worry about Warren are only proving that cognitive deficits can manifest recurrently in fresh forms. 









 It's not an analogy - it's a parody.  The original argument is a sloppy bromide, suitable for a dive bar drunk, but now popular amongst jilted Obama supporters -  but they only have themselves to blame.  They were obtuse last time around, and they think wisdom is being obtuse in the opposite direction this time around.
 




 Anyone who thought Obama was a progressive in the primaries was seriously not paying attention.  

1. He voted for telecom immunity

2. He threw progressive Joe Lamont under the bus and supported Joe Lieberman

3. He explicitly said supporters were misconstruing him as a progressive

4. He repeatedly praised Reagan

5. His speech  at Kerry's DNC ("One America") was milquetoast idiocy that called for compromise and triangulation.  Honestly, progressives who got  excited about this nonsense deserved to be disappointed.


Let's try paying attention this time.

Obama != Warren.   




 Hitler also made speeches that got a lot of hype.  Therefore Warren is like Hitler too. 




 Meh - people laughed that at the idea  a black guy named Hussein could ever in a million years win the Presidency, especially after 9/11. 




 The lesson of Obama is look carefully at candidates' actions, not just their fine words.  I thought it was obvious in the primaries - Obama embraced Joe Lieberman and threw a great progressive, Joe Lamont, under the bus, then went on to support telecom immunity.  I didn't understand why no one wanted to talk about that back then.  

We need to take a very close look at candidates, and demand fighters.  Obama, to me, seemed terrible tone-deaf and the absolutely wrong choice even as early as his speech at Kerry's nominating convention.  There is not a Republican America and a Democratic America, there is one America, he told us.  This was delusional feel good nonsense for the progressives that bought in.  For those who were awake, it already hinted at his politics of triangulation, which is to say, someone whose strategy is to placate his supporters while rewarding them with right wing policies.

And now we have Mrs. "Hard Choices".  As a wise man once said, Fool me once... can't... get fooled again!
 




 I call bullshit.

Not only does that seem false - most liberals are pissed about Obama's anti-constitutional militarism and triangulating neoliberalism --  it is demonstrably false.  Just do a search:

What gets upvoted when you search for ["Obama drones"](http://np.reddit.com/search?q=obama+drone+subreddit%3Apolitics restrict_sr=off sort=relevance t=all) or ["Obama torture"](http://np.reddit.com/search?q=obama+torture+subreddit%3Apolitics restrict_sr=off sort=relevance t=all ) ?  If we assume a liberal bias of the politics subreddit and that upvotes confer agreement (both generally accepted ideas) we find that liberals are promoting news articles which are sharply critical of the President on both of these issues.  

For example here are the Obama drone links sorted by "relevance" and "all time". 14 of the top 15 are unambiguously negative in their commentary on the President.   Only one (#8) is ambiguous.  None are positive.  A quick check of the posters submission streams will confirm that they are liberals.

1. House Democrats demand Obama release full legal basis for drone strikes

2. How Drones Help Al Qaeda: DEAR OBAMA, when a U.S. drone missile kills a child in Yemen, the father will go to war with you, guaranteed. Nothing to do with Al Qaeda. 

3. Jon Stewart Eviscerates Obama For Withholding Drone Memos: What Happened To Promise Of Transparency? 

4. New Evidence That Team Obama Misled Us About the Drone War - Official speeches are crafted to give the impression that we're mostly targeting Al Qaeda members. We're not.

5. 5 Ways President Obama Has Doubled Down on Bush's Most Tragic Mistakes: Obama has kept the U.S. on a permanent war footing, from drone strikes and proxy detentions to warrantless wiretapping and the continued operation of Guantanamo.

6. Obama Will Finally Have to Explain Why the US Can Kill Americans with Drones

7. President Obama: The drones don't work, they just make it worse

8. No More Drones For CIA. Three senior officials tell Daniel Klaidman that the Obama administration is poised to shift the CIAs drone program to the Pentagon.

9. Jon Stewart Slams Obama Over Drone Strike Memo 


10. The president as hitman in chief --"Obama has launched over 250 drone attacks during his three years in office, more than six times as many as the lawless yahoo Bush ordered during his entire presidency."


11. Why do liberals not attack Obama for perpetuating Bush's foreign policy?


12. Nobel Prize winner Malala told Obama U.S. drone attacks fuel terrorism.

13. Right wingers gloating about Obama on Fox News: "He's a born-again neocon. We've got the drones, we've got military tribunals, we've got Gitmo, we're bombing Libya. People who voted for Obama got 4 more years of Bush." - 

14. What happened to the anti-war left? 

15. Noam Chomsky: Obama Is Running Biggest Terrorist Operation That Exists... People have a reaction when they lose a loved one to an American drone strike. They dont say, Fine, I dont care if my cousin was murdered. They become what we call terrorists.

**EDIT** More support that this is liberal opinion: the sources are all center left to left. TruthDig, RawStory, The Atlantic, Vice, Al Jazeera, Daily Beast, NYTimes. 




 Typical right winger spouting false equivalency bullshit.  See my response in this thread. 




 Conservatives are, in essence, profoundly anti-American.   














 But Democrats, generally speaking, aren't arguing *for* torture.  They are (some of them) only deluded in thinking their leader is anti-torture.  Separate issue. 




 Even worse is people saying that it shouldn't matter because all Presidents are then guilty.  Normally, one should take this as an indictment of government policy, but some people think it's an excuse.  It's an indication of how corrupt the public's ethics and discourse have become since 9/11. 




 No question, but it's worth reviewing Reagan's statements on the matter to see how far we've drifted in our public debate. 














 **Submission Statement**

Torture apologists on the right have tried to obscure the commitments of United States to prosecute torture.  Who better than their most holy saint to explain it to them?  This is Reagan's message to the Senate advocating ratification of the "Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment", which he notes was agreed to *unanimously* by the international community.  The Convention was ratified by the US Senate in 1994.  



















 The US is a signatory to the Geneva conventions which are a direct result of the Nuremberg trials. 




  You can execute nearly every US president if you apply the Nuremberg laws.

Speaks volumes about US policy, doesn't it. 









 Please read the words of the US prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials, Justice Robert Jackson of SCOTUS:

["And let me make clear that while this law is first applied against German aggressors, the law includes, and if it is to serve a useful purpose it must condemn aggression by any other nations, including those which sit here now in judgment."](http://www.roberthjackson.org/the-man/speeches-articles/speeches/speeches-by-robert-h-jackson/opening-statement-before-the-international-military-tribunal/ ) 




 **Submission Statement**

The opening statement of Justice Robert Jackson of the SCOTUS at the Nuremberg Trials.  Of great relevance is the emphasis he puts on the equal application of the laws not only on Germany and Japan, but also on the victors, the United States, Britain and other axis powers.   









 **Submission Statement**

An important article that's worth a read for those who've been following the torture debate.  While the idea of accountability for these crimes has long seemed like a naive hope held by human rights advocates and parts of the left, this article explains that serious consideration is being given to the concept in international legal circles. 









 **Submission Statement**

An in-depth discussion of the historical, philosophical origins of the legal tradition of "Rule of Law" and what it means.  This is discussion from last year, but seems particularly relevant in light of the recent torture revelations and the stories about grand juries failing to bring indictments against police officers.  

 

 









 Thanks for the links.  That's helpful. 




 Undoubtedly they will ignore.  And agree that the Nobel Peace Prize winner is on the hook too. 




 So you're arguing that no one should attempt to hold anyone responsible for war crimes... because everyone is guilty?

How is that different from the argument that we shouldn't enforce any laws because police are corrupt? 




  But the UN has a fair amount to answer for as well especially with African peacekeeping operations where blue helmets have done their fair share of rape, pillaging, torture and failure to prevent genocide. 

I haven't heard that before. Do you have links?

Are you arguing that (1) American war crimes should go unpunished, or are you saying that (2) there's no organization that has the moral authority to do it, or that (3) it is politically impractical, therefore will never happen?  I just flat out disagree with (1) - a completely immoral idea.

I don't really understand (2) --- one could have argued that the Dresden bombings and Hiroshima/Nagasaki obviated the allies' right to judge their enemies, for instance.  So I don't buy what you're advocating in (2).

However,  the prediction in (3) seems plausible.  Powerful elites are rarely held accountable, so that would be par for the course.
 




 Pardoning them continues a terrible precedent, one that began with the pardon of Richard Nixon, and which has metastasized into a full-fledged dual-tier system of justice.  People at the bottom are viciously punished  for relatively minor offenses (including being killed as part of "normal" law enforcement activity), while elites, guilty of massive war and financial crimes, go free. 









 I don't think it absolves them --- we didn't use that reasoning for Germans and Japanese.   









 They are advocating going after both the officials who ordered and the people who acted on the orders. 




 I can't wait until someone responds to this kind of bullshit (on TV) with "We don't hate America. We hate *you*. Because you represent the opposite of all the true values of this country." 









 Appropriate handle. 




 It's quite a trick they're pulling -- appearing to condemn torture, while having worked consistently to prevent this from coming to light, and undermining any form of accountability.   




 Not a matter of disagreement.  Everyone must be equally accountable under the law. 




 Clever of W and Dick to opt out before their crime spree.
 




 Said every fascist everywhere. 




 Good idea, let's compare ourselves to religious extremist terrorists.  Oh wait, that describes the Republican party, doesn't it? 




 Thanks.  I think my point is that the conversation begins with us as citizens - not to fall into the nationalistic realpolitik that the Sunday shows want us to buy into. Partisans (on both sides, though the right bears more guilt) want to shield their leaders from prosecution.  This is a kind of imperial and authoritarian politics which is directly at odds with the revolutionary principles which have guided us up until recent decades.   




  I simply mean to say that the U.S.'s contribution to the world through the UN is the only reason the UN has stayed quasi-relevant at best. 

I don't disagree with that.  Our elected leaders may think that because "they" fund the UN, they should not be accountable.  My point is that the citizens of the US fund the UN, not our elected leaders.  The question is whether we, as citizens of the US, want a policy whereby our military and elected officials may not be held unaccountable for war crimes by anyone.  That is the politics of authoritarianism, and directly counters basic American ideals.

 The enforcement of UN policies when referencing the actions of individual nations have been, since the existence of the UN, slanted with national interests from the accusing parties. 

Isn't this exactly the point of the UN? A place where international disputes can be settled peacefully and with the agreement of the world community?

 Not to mention the UN ignoring multiple instances of genocide and torture throughout the world giving less and less reason for the US or any member nation to submit themselves to ICC prosecution.

Could you give examples of this?  The first thing that comes to mind is ignoring what happened in Rwanda.  The current example that comes to mind is Palestine, and before that, Nicaragua's CIA-funded death squads, and East Timor.  Apart from Rwanda, in all of these cases the US was directly involved or shielding a client state from accountability.  In the Rwandan case, the US (under Clinton) and its allies put pressure on the UN to ignore the warning signals.

Regarding the ICC, Bush and Cheney opted out at the beginning of their term, and conveniently  before embarking on a spree of war crimes. So I'm not sure what you mean when you say 

  It's time for the U.S. to stop playing with the UN 

That is already the case.  The US and its clients commit atrocities and are not held accountable.  

I'm also confused by the idea that the US "should just acknowledge that world affairs are not black and white".  I can only infer that this means we should continue our policy of committing and supporting war crimes and justifying it by any means necessary in the UN - when that suits us.  Obviously, I strongly disagree.  

 




 "Don't police the policemen!", said all wingnuts everywhere. 
























  One of my favorite films. 

Mine too :). 




 I thought the Barry Lyndon voice over had a quite different character than what one finds in Nolan -- there's a very wry kind of observation going on constantly.  The voice itself is a character that more serves the purpose of highlighting the absurd humor of the proceedings than being a blunt expositor of plot and emotion as in Nolan. 




 The sound mix was deliberate - I think there's a video of him talking about it somewhere - or see [here](http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/17/interstellar-sound-christopher-nolan ).  The effect he was going after was the experience of being in those situations -- where the human voice is merely part of the soundscape, another sound effect.  Hitchcock used this technique very deliberately  when critical pieces of exposition were being delivered.  The effect was to cause the audience to pay greater attention - to lean in to observe a critical moment.  In Interstellar, the frustration of not hearing voice helps us experience the chaos, the overwhelming power of the phenomena that the astronauts experience. 




 So we should support deception because "it's a blog".

 














 For the record, I don't think history will be kind to him, and he'll deserve it.  His legacy is one of failing to hold criminals accountable --- the architects of torture and war crimes from the Bush era, as well as those on Wall Street.  His presidency will be compared unfavorably with FDR's.  He will be seen as having failed to seize the opportunities in a pivotal moment, choosing instead to extend the authoritarian and neoliberal policies of his predecessors.  He will be seen as ushering in an era of deep and unrelenting pessimism when he could have articulated a new direction forward. 









 Reiterating findings is perfectly fine - I'm objecting to the title.  It's a cheesy marketing  trick.  The author had some old article about group psych kicking around, added a couple of flimsy lines about Ferguson, and pasted this title on it.  This is both lazy and deceptive. 




 Why?  That's the message of Republicans at both the state and national levels. 




 You obviously didn't listen to Sen. Rockefeller's testimony at the hearings. 




 Seems like the title is link bait for a fairly general article on basic findings of group psychology. 









 Where is it? 




   I note with some exasperation, by the way, that he feels the need to throw some imprecations regarding the financial industry into an article about an issue that has nothing to do with it. 

Let me defend him.  I think his insight is quite apropos.  There is a mounting frustration that the entire game is rigged.  People on the bottom get treated brutally for tiny infractions, while elites get away with crimes.  That certainly is part of the cultural zeitgeist.   

In Berkeley and Oakland, a large number of the demonstrators are self-identified Occupy activists. It's a very short leap for these people to connect the same dots that Taibbi has. The original target of Occupy was Wall Street, which activists argued were essentially stealing from the public, but which the government was unwilling to police.  Now, these same people are out on the streets angry that powerless people are over-policed.  That is Taibbi's argument in a nutshell.

In the original protests, the police, were largely perceived as preserving public order, though there was a sense, because of their occassional overzealousness that they stood on the side of the "elite criminals of Wall Street" (i.e., from the perspective of the activists).  Yet, that role was only incidental.  As a result of the Ferguson/Garner protests, police themselves are now the issue.  So, in the eyes of the protesters, they have gone from being an instrument protecting elite criminals to themselves being criminals themselves in need of policing.  

That is what Taibbi is talking about.  Those activists on the ground are starting to see the police themselves as illegitimate.  That is a sea change.  I think you'll agree that in this light, the stats you cite (from 2011, no less) aren't really in scope here.  This is a question of what will happen at the next demonstration, now that police themselves are seen as part of the problem.   And in fact, [recent polls support the argument that, amongst minorities at least, confidence has been lost](http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/poll-shows-deep-racial-divide-confidence-law-enforcement-n263041 ): 

 And while 72 percent of the public and 79 percent of whites say that they have "a great deal" or "a fair amount" of confidence that police in their community will not use excessive force on suspects, just 43 percent of black Americans say the same.

Conservatives are unlikely to see things this way because it doesn't fit their narrative, but their opinions don't matter in this.  A powerful anger is brewing which inequities and injustices will continue to feed, meaning that there will be more protests.  What will happen at the next one and the next one after that now that those protesters see the police as illegitimate? 














 "Reagan bankrupted the Soviet Union" is conservative propaganda that originates from the same crowd that sold us the idea that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction:

http://open.salon.com/blog/paul_j_orourke/2009/01/17/losing_the_cold_warthe_true_story_of_why_the_ussr_fell

The real explanation is more boring, but has the benefit of being believable: the Soviets couldn't produce enough grain so relied on oil exports.  When the Saudi oil embargo ended,oil prices fell by 2/3rds and the USSR's export income collapsed.  Reagan didn't do that, and no one claims he's responsible for that either. 

Gorbachev and other Soviet officials support this view: http://www.theatlantic.com/past/politics/foreign/reagrus.htm.  

 A far more persuasive reason for the Soviet economic decline is the rigid "command economy" imposed by Stalin in the early 1930s. It did not reward individual or collective effort; it absolved Soviet producers from the discipline of the market; and it gave power to officials who could not be held accountable by consumers. Consequently much of the investment that went into the civilian sector of the economy was wasted. 

 Gorbachev felt free to make a series of proposals for deep cuts in his country's nuclear arsenal because he was confident that the United States would not attack the Soviet Union. In conversation with his military advisers he rejected any plans that were premised on war with the West. Since he saw no threat of attack by the United States, Gorbachev was not intimidated by the military programs of the Reagan Administration. "These were unnecessary and wasteful expenditures that we were not going to match," he told us. If both superpowers were to avoid the growing risk of accidental war, they had to make deep cuts in their strategic forces. "This was an imperative of the nuclear age."

In fact, a Soviet ambassador insists that Reagan's policies unwittingly prolonged the Cold War: "Star Wars was exploited by hardliners to complicate Gorbachev's attempt to end the Cold War."  The hero in ending the Cold War, if there was one, was Gorbachev. 



















  And unless the police suffer a massive crisis of legitimacy, such that on a very basic level we outright don't trust them to use force, this is pretty much the way it has to be. 

Interesting that you mention that.  Did you see Taibbi's latest?
http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-police-in-america-are-becoming-illegitimate-20141205 




 He was present when the Soviet Union ended, but he certainly didn't end it.  The Soviet Union collapsed because its economic system was intrinsically broken, or do Republicans disagree with that now?  Or do they just disagree with that only when they want to praise Reagan?

LOL.  That's why Democrats today are the ones waving the Confederate flag, right?  Oh, wait... 




 It's a sick joke.  We spend billions on war to protect the  interests of billionaires, fake-praise the troops to make the task seem honorable, and discard the broken bodies and lives that come out of the process.

 Honestly, that seems somewhat myopic.  It's pretty clear to even the most casual observer that they are both on the conservative side of the spectrum on many issues.  Hillary, arguably even more hawkish than Bill.  If we ignore the past, we'll repeat our mistakes.  If we don't understand history, we're won't ask the right questions today. 




 Hillary is not just 20 years ago. 




 There are a lot of "liberals" who didn't pick up on Obama's conservative politics until it was far too late and still don't understand that the Clintons are part of the problem.    




 Understanding our mistakes is the first step if we want to avoid repeating them.  Electing conservadems is proven path to failure. 









 "Hard choices".  Neoliberals really ought to trademark that one.  Blair and his comrades have been making the "hard choices" to serve the interests of globalist billionaires, and the voters are making it difficult for do-gooders like him to transfer even more wealth to them using the levers of government.  If only the  common people were capable of understanding!

I don't have words for the kind of disgust that Blair and his ilk fill me with. 














 How does one get arrested for selling loosies?  Broken windows policing.

 Not even sure it should be appointed by the governor.  The requirement should be a truly independent prosecutor, though I imagine there are all kinds of problems having this be run out of the DoJ. 




 A lot of disease were mocked as psychological disorders before the causes were discovered.   One of the messages that needs to get out is that non-celiac gluten sensitivity is a thing that can be seen with molecular diagnostics like RAST. 




 It's a Kenyan plot! 




 Could not replicate.  I got exactly the same prices.  Even used a different browser so it didn't have cookies from my previous search. 




 Race is a big part of it:

  Look at the crime hotspots.. the areas where most of these murders occur. They aren't in places with super-high firearms ownership like Wyoming or New Hampshire. They're in Detroit, Chicago..

Did a quick search.  It looks like most of the violence per capita is in southern cities, but not, interestingly, in southern rural areas:

http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/20/news/la-ol-gun-homicide-states-20121220

 Urban states with heavy gang populations such as California and New York aren't particularly high up on the list of per-capita gun killings, though of course in terms of absolute numbers, they look like murder capitals because of their big populations. 

 **Mid-size Southern states seem to be the places people are trigger-happiest** -- and where, of course, political opposition to gun control often runs strongest. Perhaps that's because **most of the bloodletting happens in Southern cities**, and it's in rural areas -- where gun violence is slight -- that gun rights are held most sacred.

 Two marketing agencies serving the same customer. 




 That's rational policy, though.   




 So many racists on reddit nowadays. 




 Why do you think gun violence is so much higher here in the United States?  By the way - I'm not reflexively anti-gun.  I'm from Canada, and we have more guns per person up there, but way fewer gun deaths per person. 




 The coffee lawsuit is an urban legend.  If you know the facts, it's pretty clear that McDonald's deserved the punitive damages:

 Trial testimony showed that at 180 to 190 degrees, McDonald's coffee was much hotter than that served by other restaurants or by people in their homes. **The fast-food chain had received at least 700 complaints about hot coffee in the previous decade and had paid more than half a million dollars in settlements**, according to trial testimony cited by the Wall Street Journal. 



 Liebeck's injuries were hardly minor. She suffered third-degree burns on her thighs and groin area, was hospitalized for a week and had to undergo painful skin grafts. **Before filing a lawsuit, she wrote McDonald's requesting that it lower the temperature of its coffee and cover her uninsured medical bills and incidental costs of about $20,000. McDonald's offered $800**.



 Later, as the case neared trial, a mediator recommended that McDonald's pay a settlement of $225,000. The company refused. 



 Jurors ultimately awarded Liebeck $160,000 in compensatory damages and about $2.7 million in punitive damages. "The facts were so overwhelmingly against the company," one of the jurors told the Journal. "Their callous disregard was very upsetting," another said.

 Just a note, neoliberals != liberals.  Neoliberals are people who espouse laissez-faire trade policy --- i.e., typically conservatives. 




 But not everyone does, and the result is a society with an enormous number of gun deaths.  I like to drive fast and I haven't been in any accidents.  It doesn't mean I should have the right to drive 150 through a school zone. 




 As a comparison, British citizens are 100 times less likely to be shot by a police officer than Americans: http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2014/08/armed-police 




 Surely, that's meant sardonically. 




 Insults not withstanding, you haven't shown anything to prove your case. 









 That is not what the article says.  You're reading the conclusion you'd like to see.

 Police officers get that benefit of the doubt at every step along the way. 

And

 The lack of serious second-guessing is baked into the system.

And

Still, even that low-end estimate suggests that police shoot and kill someone in the United States more than once a day, on average. The overwhelming majority of those killings are deemed justified before the case ever reaches a jury.

And

Meanwhile, as FiveThirtyEights Ben Casselman has argued, prosecutors rely on the police to do their jobs day in and day out, so they have few reasons to prosecute a cop aggressively and plenty of incentive to present a less persuasive case than they might otherwise, consciously or not.

And 

  Those cases certainly exist, even if they are likely more uncommon than is generally accepted.... In reality, its a wonder that any cop ever gets indicted for killing someone in the line of duty.

Say the opposite. 









 And even then, who knows what prosecutors tell a Grand Jury?  It's not enough.  There needs to be a special prosecutor appointed when cops are accused.   



















 I think it's a Hangouts thing.  It is built to use as much CPU as possible.  It's offloading compute to the clients. 









 On Chrome or Safari, it practically pins all the CPUs.  

Lots of people are seeing it: https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=hangouts+cpu+usage 




 I want good voice/video.  Hangouts is horrendous - it's impossible to receive calls, and absolutely chews through battery (1% per minute on my 2.5GHz Quadcore 2015 Macbook Pro).  Skype, well, Microsoft managed to make the UX even worse, didn't they?

And group chat/video is critical, especially for work, so I think this could be a really important entry into the field.  These guys know what they're doing.
 









 Interesting, thanks for the clarification. 




 Agree that insisting on a specific outcome in a specific case when the facts aren't known isn't productive.  However, this is a teaching moment, and this case falls into a broad pattern.  It's very much worth pointing that out. I was pretty disgusted with the righteous, near-racism here on Reddit when the prosecutor gave his extremely unusual defense of the person he was supposedly prosecuting.  The real story is that cops keep getting off and prosecutors keep protecting them, so I think it's worth getting that story out. 




 It's not a coverup, it's business as usual.  If there's a conspiracy, it's one that happens all the time, and is to be expected when colleagues are in charge of policing each other.  In fact, [while grand juries *almost always* indict, they frequently don't when the defendant is a police officer.]( http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/ferguson-michael-brown-indictment-darren-wilson/ )

Ironically, the right - which is constantly warning of Obama's jackbooted government thugs coming to take their guns away to Kenya - wants to change the conversation when the left points out systemic issues leading to an actual police state.  

Prosecutors shouldn't be in charge of prosecuting their direct colleagues.  The glaring conflict of interest is producing the expected result, and the obvious moral hazard means cops act with impunity.  This isn't speculation - it's fact, and a situation which is being repeated constantly for obvious, logical reasons.  Body cameras are only a part of the solution. The next step is a law requiring  special prosecutors to deal with police criminality.  

 




 But I thought a grand jury needs to indict him, and that you can't call two grand juries for the same case (or does double jeopardy not apply here?)
