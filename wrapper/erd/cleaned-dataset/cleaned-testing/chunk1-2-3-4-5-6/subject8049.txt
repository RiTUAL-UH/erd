 TIL Conan O'Brien went to Harvard. 




 ...and it crashes in the ocean near a remote island. The man and Brooklyn Decker swim to shore and are the only survivors. They immediately find food and build shelter. With nothing else to do, they begin having sex.

They are having sex multiple times a day for over two weeks, until one day Brooklyn finds the man standing on the beach alone. She approaches him and asks "What's wrong? Is it me? Is it the sex?" The man replies, "No, it's not you and the sex is great... It's just, well... Do you mind if I do something?" Brooklyn replies, "No, whatever you want, I just want you to be happy."

The man then takes off his hat and puts it on Brooklyn's head, tucking her hair up into it. Then he rubs mud on her face in the shape of a beard and says...

"DUDE! I HAVE BEEN HAVING SEX WITH BROOKLYN DECKER FOR THE LAST TWO WEEKS!" 




 Also came to say this:  Check out McCauley's side project, Middle Brother, with Taylor Goldsmith (Dawes) and Matt Vasquez (Delta Spirit). 




 I FUCKING love Deer Tick... McCauley is one of my favorite singer-songwriters!  For anyone digging this song, please check out their 2nd album, The Black Dirt Sessions, super moody! 




 This is in no way structurally similar to "Carolina Drama"... the song never reaches a climax of head-banging proportions like "Little Black Submarines".  And just for the record, neither The White Stripes nor The Black Keys were on the radar when they were putting out their early albums.

EDIT: I am referring to the mainstream radar, by the way. 














 Yeah, I agree. Eminem just did a song on the Marshall Mathers LP2 that samples it too.

A Plan for the Improvement of English Spelling

by Mark Twain

For example, in Year 1 that useless letter "c" would be dropped to be replased either by "k" or "s," and likewise "x" would no longer be part of the alphabet. The only kase in which "c" would be retained would be the "ch" formation, which will be dealt with later. Year 2 might reform "w" spelling, so that "which" and "one" would take the same konsonant, wile Year 3 might well abolish "y" replasing it with "i" and Iear 4 might fiks the "g/j" anomali wonse and for all.

Jenerally, then, the improvement would kontinue iear bai iear with Iear 5 doing awai with useless double konsonants, and Iears 6-12 or so modifaiing vowlz and the rimeining voist and unvoist konsonants. Bai Iear 15 or sou, it wud fainali bi posibl tu meik ius ov thi ridandant letez "c," "y" and "x"--bai now jast a memori in the maindz ov ould doderez--tu riplais "ch," "sh," and "th" rispektivli.

 Ok, so about 7 years ago, I was working out pretty hard and supplementing Creatine. I was taking the capsules, which you are supposed to swallow with a LARGE glass of water. Well, one morning I was running late for work, after the gym, and I throw the capsules in my mouth and swallow them at the water fountain. About a mile down the road my throat starts drying up severely and then I cough... POOF... Creatine powder everywhere and it tastes like shit so I start gagging until I pull over, open the door, and puke...and puke...and puke. The Creatine powder coated my throat so bad I couldn't stop gagging.

Also, I took my glasses off in the process of puking and set them on my seat... I sat on them and broke them when I got back into the car.

TL;DR Creatine and then sat on my glasses, breaking them.

 If a government institution (and it's constituents) is deciding whether or not a mother can choose to give birth to her own flesh and blood, then it can expand welfare to all the women and children suffering due to the force behind such a choice. 




 Monty Squared? 




 I believe what she is referring to is the people who are "pro-life" and "anti-welfare"... it seems, IMO, that the people forcing women to have a baby that they cannot mentally, physically, or financially take care of are the ones that are unwilling to provide for them once they have sacrificed a career, a life, or an education to raise the baby. 




 I'm pro-choice because I've never been a fourteen-year-old incest victim pregnant by her father, or a woman who's going to die if the pregnancy continues, or a rape victim, or even a teenager who made a mistake. I want women to have choices, but I also believe that it's a life, especially once it's big enough to live outside the womb.

 I don't have anything on Muslims in other parts of the world, but this Gallup article speaks to the contrary as far as American-Muslims are concerned:

http://www.gallup.com/poll/148763/muslim-americans-no-justification-violence.aspx

EDIT: Changed Muslim to Muslims. 



















 "Given what we know both about western media portrayals of Islam and Muslims on the one hand, and media effects and theory on the other hand, it would be foolish to dismiss western media representations as potential causal factors in anti-Muslim sentiment and crime. In fact, it is likely that anti-Muslim sentiment and crime are, at least in part, driven by one-sided, narrow, sensationalistic, and arguably bigoted western media portrayals of Islam and Muslims."

That is called a slap on the wrist.

Then jump back up and link to Matt Taibbi's 2013 article (http://google.com/newsstand/s/CBIw5r-19Ro) and read up on the "fine" issued by the USJD in 2012 and tell me how much HSBC paid.  He also states, "In other words... the banks have us by the balls, that the social cost of putting their executives in jail might end up being larger than the cost of letting them get away with, well, anything.

EDIT: Removed ZERO. 




 Ok, well, we are officially going around in circles... Just keep my username handy so you can gloat when all of these people are **publicly humiliated** for not paying their respective shares and then prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law... But I **seriously** doubt that will happen. This **HUGE** news story will just be another flash in the pan.

I mean, c'mon, did you see what Kanye did to Beck at the Grammy's?!? Media outlets air this garbage and rich people everywhere applaud. 




 Or how prestigious the school was that you attended... Just read Malcolm Gladwell's book *David and Goliath*

 It seems replacing this person with a machine and then properly educating/training said person in a STEM field would be much more productive... That was some incredible focus and fine-motor skills! 




 I always heard this one in college: 

"A" students will work for "B" students in buildings built by "C" students. 




 I would just like to say that I am glad we are able to have this discussion and I appreciate your willingness (as well as mine) to remain civil through the duration. With that being said...

Yes, again, my point remains the same... 30,000 leaked documents telling us what we already know is not news, from a "Wow! Really? That is actually going on?" standpoint. 30,000 rich assholes being prosecuted because of what we already know is news. All the time, information like this is released - about how all the rich people are cheating the system, rigging the game, fixing the score, etc, etc, etc. - and nothing ever happens because of it. The richest 1% will soon own half of the world's wealth... and there is not a single thing the 99% can do about it at this point. Money has been the single source of corruption for as long as money has existed.

Take Edward Snowden for example... Does anyone really believe he STOPPED the US govt. (or any other) from spying on their citizens? Please... They probably amped it up further, faster.

I understand what you are saying to me, however, I still stand beside the reason for my initial comment. 









 Again, it will be news when someone is actually prosecuted... and serves a real sentence. 









 Yeah, I'm not even gonna try to be smooth about this one... I totally missed it. That's what I get for commenting on Reddit before I finish my first cup of coffee... *hangs head in shame* 




 No, it is not... Throw a dart at fortune 500 companies and you will have a 100% success rate at hitting one that is avoiding millions a year in taxes. It is common knowledge... Or should be, in a country built on a financial system such as the USA's.

 Does a little girl appearing to jack off Grover not make you say, "WHAT THE FUCK?!?" 




 Thank you for your comment. Once again, my intention was not to point to the girl and say, "She should not be born." My intention was to poke fun at her parents, who should not be raising children in the way they do. They have turned her childhood into a reckless circus coordinated for all of the world to see. That is insensitive. That is irresponsible. But who am I? I'm just a person on the internet engaging in a discussion on what is apparently "right" and "wrong"... One thing is for sure though, the last thing I am ever going to do, is be all sensitive about things I see on the internet. I appreciate your opinion, I feel you have a valid argument... And with that, have a nice day. I have to get back to raising my children with love and kindness and to teaching them to have a sense of humor about life and all of it's oddities... Including other people. 




 Thank you for your wonderful insight kind commenter... I actually have three young children and I raise them in a way, that I believe, is appropriate. Which means that I am not feeding my children excessive amounts of food, dressing them up like inanimate dolls, and exploiting them on television for profit. This post depicts a natural disaster, IMO, of parents like hers not needing to raise children for so many obvious reasons, they cannot all be described in this comment, or better yet, an essay. I'm glad that you have a natural right in this world to express your views of opposition.

If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear."

 ...slight of ass-licking? 




 While having a bite to eat, they talked about their moonshine operation.
 
Suddenly, a woman at a nearby table who is eating a sandwich, began to cough. After a minute or so, it became apparent that she was in real distress.
 
One of the hillbillies looked at her and said, "Kin ya swallar?"  The woman shook her head no.  
  
Then he asked, "Kin ya breathe?"   The woman began to turn blue and shook her head no.
 
The hillbilly walked over to the woman, lifted up her dress, yanked down her drawers, and quickly gave her right butt cheek a lick with his tongue.
 
The woman was so shocked that she had a violent spasm, and the obstruction flew out of her mouth.  As she began to breathe again, the Hillbilly walked slowly back to his table.
 
His buddy said, "Ya know, I'd heerd of that there 'Hind Lick Maneuver' but I ain't niver seed nobody do it!"

Make shit up? No no no... I just **READ**. Ever tried it?

*Hitler originally wore the Kaiser moustache, as evidenced by photographs of him as a soldier during World War I.[7] There is no agreement as to what year Hitler first adopted the toothbrush.[1] Alexander Moritz Frey, who served with Hitler during World War I, said Hitler wore the toothbrush in the trenches after he was ordered to trim his moustache to facilitate the wearing of a gas mask.[1][8]*

 I mean, I get that reddit is a community dedicated to original content, but not everyone...

**a) has time to search everything they feel is unique and interesting before posting**

**b) has seen everything unique and interesting posted on reddit for all of time**

**c) has posted something, knowing it is a repost, for the soul purpose of receiving upvotes**

Are reposts really such a detriment to reddit that a person (and I tend to believe "most" redditors are unaware of reposting) should be subjected to such ridicule?

If you are aware of a post being a repost, just don't upvote it, IMO... When a repost receives a lot of upvotes, is it not because the redditors upvoting have never seen it before? And find it unique and interesting?

 If every redditor had to search Google or KarmaDecay all the time to experience past posts or check for reposts, wouldn't reddit become less relevant?

I apologize in advance for my ignorance of this subject. I am a long-time "lurker" and have just recently decided to create a username and begin contributing to the community... So I'm relatively "new-ish".  Also, thanks in advance for anyone who replies!

 After they got their tent all set up, both men fell sound asleep. Some hours later, Tonto wakes the Lone Ranger and says, "Kemo Sabe, look 
towards sky, what you see?"

The Lone Ranger replies, "I see millions of stars."

"What that tell you?" asked Tonto.

The Lone Ranger ponders for a minute then says, "Astronomically speaking, it tells me there are millions of galaxies. Time wise, it appears to be approximately a quarter past three in the morning. Theologically, the Lord is all powerful and we are small and insignificant. Meteorologically, it seems we will have a beautiful day tomorrow. What's it tell YOU, Tonto?"

"You dumber than buffalo. Someone stole tent."
