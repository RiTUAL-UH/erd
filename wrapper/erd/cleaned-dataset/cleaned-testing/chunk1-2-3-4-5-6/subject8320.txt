 Deadly Premonition 2: The Deadcoming 




 Japanese Hard Dance is so under exposed (which is sad because it's an awesome scene!) and for anyone interested in speedcore check out M1dy

Edit: also if your interested in hardcore checkout Kobaryo, his song clock control is great 




 Awhile ago I really didn't like speedcore... Now I like it, anyways RWC dose some good stuff and I would recommend checking out some of his terrorcore   extra tone if your feeling crazy :' ) and if your not feeling crazy don't worry he also dose hardstyle under the name shingo DJ 




 I'm a little sad this release isn't hard dance but I am sooo happy Mat's back! 




 [Me still in my PJ's on a Sunday](http://imgur.com/DqzWC19) 




 Hardcore for life 




 Get this song for free from the DL's in the description then play dark souls so you can engage in jolly cooperation while you listen! 









 Get this song for free form the DL's in the discription and then play dark souls so you can engage in jolly cooperation while you listen!  




 Baebii :D 




 Ohh... Maby A fine romance by frank or some where beond the sea by Bobby Darin  




 The sad thing is this could actually be a thing that you would see pop up on your news feed 




 I totally forgot about gammer! Also I've never heard that song before so thanks! 




 Oh sweet!, I thought it was that guy he killed... 




 I'm a huge gabber/hardstyle/hard trance head and I've been getting into happy hardcore lately so please give me some suggestions! The only people I know of right now are Rhythmics, Nanobii, S3rl   Matduke 




 What's woolie supost to be? 




 Some one please make a video where all the pics are of woolie/grandma swamp 




 Dude I know, I was reading it and the whole time I was like ":(" the I saw the familiar vegtiable at the end of the article  




 Look closer at the website... 














 He responded to my message on FB and said that it might be hard for him to do because he doesn't really have a method. I for one would love to see how he made the kick from sounds of the machine if he dose decide to make one  














 Just think about it, hiding from lickers in lockers, running away from 2 hunters instead of the twins and of course nemesis would replace walker  
























 Recently I've been listening to a lot of speedcore, terrorcore .etc stuff I told my self I would never enjoy when I started listening to hard dance. As you can tell by the title that has all changed, so please link me the most fucked up stuff you know! 









 I get most of my hardstyle from the yearly Cloud 9 hardstyle compilations (10$ = 100 songs, great deal) recently I found out about the 2014 compilation and to my sadness I already own two of the songs on the compilation (God said 2k14   Reality) are there any songs that grab you as must haves? [iTunes link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/hardstyle-top-100-2014/id893210852) 









 This February me and my friend will get up on stage in front of 500+ high school students and play a 20 min DJ set. He will be doing 10 min of house and I will be doing 10 min of hardstyle, since most people at my school haven't heard of hardstyle I'm going to do a euphoric set as opposed to a raw one. With that in mind I want my set to be the best euphoric, harmonically mixed gateway into hardstyle ever! Even though I have a lot of euphoric stuff I still want to hear from you guys, so please link me some of your favorite euphoric tracks. Also, producers.... Do you have a track that you think 500+ first time hardstyle listeners would love? Well link me some of your stuff and I'll see what I can do to get your song in my mix :) 


































 I think someone could get a lot of mileage out of doing a parody of music production like by referencing modern talking in massive, vengeance sample packs, pirating and other things. FL Studio would probably be the best choice for this but it could still be funny in other programs like ableton, logic, reason, cubase and pro tools

 Hello everyone. As the title says can someone fill me in? I haven't seen any spam (I'm guessing the mods deleted it). Also can someone tell me how it all started, thanks :)

p.s. I promise I'm not trying to agitate the situation if someone tells me to take this down I will. 




 1.What are some of your hobbies? 2. Besides hard dance what other genres on music do you like? 3. Favorite food? 4. What got you into music as a whole? 5. Can I post your response on the hardstyle sub?


1. Hobbies, anything i do is geared towards improving myself and my creativity. Be that weight training (clears body and mind) reading up on art techniques (going through a graffiti phase) or minecraft (started a few days ago, experiencing a new world), I try to keep things varied. Might take up fishing next.
2. I actually try to listen to as little hard dance as possible. This is because I want to keep my 'work' fresh and not to be over saturated with the same sounds all the time. I listen to a lot of drum and bass and movie scores, but often house, trap n moomba.
3. All food when prepared with fresh, quality ingredients is awesome. I do have a soft spot for italian cuisine, but I love a good kangaroo steak too.
4. I got into music because once I heard it, I wanted to make it. Though this question is a bit like Alice in Wonderland, the hole goes as far as you want it to go....
5. Sure. Dunno if its gonna be that interesting tho.

 














 What's your favorite distortion plug-in and why? For me I'd have to say ohmicide, it's easy to use and you can get great results with it 














 Hello all! Yesterday I made a [monstercat anime post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Monstercat/comments/2gil1y/lets_make_a_monstercat_anime/) and from the looks of it, it didn't do too well :/, but I won't let that discourage me! (If this post doesn't do well promise I won't do more) so any ways here's the premise: make up a morning routine for you favorite producer (make it as bad or as good as you want!) I'll start! " Rameses was awoken from his deep sleep by the familiar sound of rain. He quietly got out of bed and went to the window and stared out at the cloudy Yorkshire landscape. "I could wright so meany songs about this" he thought to himself, and before he knew it he had been starring out his window for 30 minuets. When he finally snapped out of it he saw he was going to be late if he didn't hurry, so he quickly ran downstairs grabbed his crumpet with jam and rushed out the door. (forgetting his umbrella I might add :3) 
























 everything is reverberating (even the start up sound) I've tried opening a new project and restarting my computer but nothings working. [heres what it sounds like](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/problem)
EDIT: It is my sound card. dose anyone know how to fix it? 
  














 I've noticed that quite a few people on here listen to rap so tell me... Who are your favorites? Mine are P.O.S/Doomtree, Brother Ali and Atmosphere (you might notice a bias here, that's because I live really close too the twin cities)  



















 "for those curious i'm 90% done with say it ain't so. another week or two and i'll start shopping to labels"
 





























 A while ago I saw this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/sciencefiction/comments/2dx51k/ive_always_loved_the_scifi_style_album_covers_for/) about how cool looking pretty lights album art was. So I decided why not share some cool art but this time with a heavy/industrial look. Also for those wondering Vision recordings is Noisia's record label and for those who don't know who Noisia is they are a 3 man neuro funk/DnB group and I highly recommend them!

 I've been getting into Melbourne bounce lately and I need some artist suggestions   









 For me I'd have to say TC's dog [Rex](https://m.facebook.com/tc.bristol/photos/pb.48469779094.-2207520000.1409108882./10152483245584095/?type=1 source=42) 









 I know we have some shufflers/jumpers on here and I would love too see you guys in action! Post a video of your self :D 







































 John Berkey was a artist who made [breath](http://www.fond-ecran.com/ORIGINAUX/divers/john_berkey/john_berkey_011.jpg) [taking](http://www.tucoo.com/fantasy/f_john_berkey/images/sf_john_berkey016.jpg) space ship scenes (and saying that isn't doing his art nearly enough justice). Now, some of you may be thinking "say this looks a little bit like star wars" well thats because he [did](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DuQ1FWS6Iiw/UR70HxsiF6I/AAAAAAAAdVw/3iMF1oTIWzs/s1600/star-wars-cover__john_berkey.jpg) do some art for the star wars movies. Also on an unrelated note John Berkey is the reason I know some one at VALVe and one of the reasons I got to take a tour of VALVe HQ    




 Dear Pat Powertuff, because of your expertise in the subject of RE4 I was finally able to beat it, I also learned a few things from your play through with matt: the Red9 is the perfect weapon for leading a one man crusade across "Rural Europe", the TMP is a hardened black turd (Although the ammo box is super hype), shotguns are mans greatest creation, knifes are great against crazy buff military mans, verdugos are SUPER cool!!, Salazar's whine when he gets stabbed in the hand is one of the best stupid noises I've ever heard, the broken butterfly is basically deaths scythe in the form of a magnum and finally separate ways sucks :( the only kinda good thing about it is you get to stare at Ada's butt the whole time. Best regards, test_subject8320 




 Before I goto bed I like to listen to music and in doing so I've noticed something about myself. Listening to Hardcore, Hard Trance, Hardstyle and Psy/Forest Trance actually helps me sleep while listening to Chill music by people like Mr. FijiWiji, Rameses B and Direct actually makes me less tired. Dose this apply to anyone else or is their just something wrong with my brain?  
























 I honestly love both. I love the happy up beat melodies of UK Hardcore but I also love the violently distorted kicks of Hardcore  









 My questions were:

1. Do you ever plan on doing hardcore (the non happy kind)?

2. Who are your musical influences?

3. I remember you said somewhere that you don't do collabs so if you were forced at gun point who would you collab with?

4. Can I post your response to the monstercat sub? Stay kawaii!!!!


Here's his response:

1. i really dislike the non-happy hardcore you're talking about because it doesn't 
 have any elements at all that i value in music, so no

2. mitch murder (synthwave and 80s music overall), dj shimamura, kz, early owl city.

3. i said i don't do collabs with just ANYONE. there needs to be some form of friendship established through chats or whatever imo. but if i'd have to pick someone it'd be mitch murder

4. sure. you too ()

 





































































 My questions were 1. Who are your musical influences? 2. Are any of your new tracks collaborations? 3. Can I post your response to /r/Monstercat?

Here's what he had to say:

1. I'm influenced by everything- both in music and through visual art! My older tracks just kind of happened, I just sat down and made them, no specific inspiration there!

2. No collabs- I work in a very drawn out way and I like to get things sounding exactly right before moving on, especially with my new music. I don't think many collaborators would be cool with sitting around for months working on something! That said I do have plans to work with vocalists in the future- but not the traditional "vocalist sings verse on track" kind of way, I'll have her sing whatever, and then chop it up/process it like an instrument. I like vocal snippets and how they can convey the emotion of a vocal, without actually having any discernible words. Looking to take that to the next level with my unreleased stuff!

3. Sure thing, fine by me!
 














 its by SMD and it has a guy laughing in the beginning   



















 Free songs are preferred but not required, also it doesn't just have to be monstercat  














 For me it's jay cosmic's remix of rocket  






















































 For me it's a tie between the screech from dragon born by Headhunterz and the screech from destroy by Atmozfears  









 So I did a post like this on the monstercat sub awhile ago and it got a pretty good reception. 
 Rules:
post a mix that your proud of (preferably hardstyle) in the comments and say what you use for mixing the winner will be the person with the most up votes 

* what you win: my respect as a DJ and the love of the sub (possibly) 




 I know Audiofreq has one  




 As you all know Mr. Suicide sheep always finds amazing pictures to go along with his uploads. [My favorite is this one](http://arcipello.deviantart.com/art/Scorched-earth-304068383) it's actually my back round in FL studio  














 Same Rules as [last time](http://www.reddit.com/r/Monstercat/comments/27uk1n/djs_lets_have_a_little_competition/) if you competed last time just post a diffrent mix  





























 So a while ago F3tch released some patches for massive. All of them are very robotic and gritty so they might not be for every producer, but for the ones who make heavy dubstep I would recommend checking them out [heres a link to his FB page](https://www.facebook.com/F3tchmusic/app_220150904689418) 




 "Something more. Better. Greater. Meaningful. Unforgettable. Beautiful.

In the near Future."
 









 Timeless is probably my favorite. Her voice just adds so much to the song  




 Here's what he had to say "Oh awesome!   I've been considering doing some more collabs in the EDM world, maybe something trap-y.   Thanks for showing me yo " 




 By colorful I mean people like Madeon and Grant Bowtie  









 For me it would either have to be Aero Chord or Noisestorm (Aero Chord is from Greece and Noisestrom is from Dublin so it be awesome to hear their sexy accents also) 




 INFO: 
1. Post a mix you've made below (doesn't have to include monstercat songs)
2. Say what software you use (you don't have to but still it would be cool to know)

RULES FOR VOTING:
Be fair and nice, don't judge on length but on song choice, transitions, etc. 

The winner will be the person with the most points on their comment 

WHAT YOU WIN: 
1. My respect as a DJ
2. The love of our savior GQ (Maybe)   




 What do you guys think? 




 I have been watching quiet a few videos from before 2010 and I have to say, the Melbourne shuffle is really cool and it makes me a little sad that its not as popular as it used to be. So /r/ Monstercat can we bring it back or should I ask /r/ Hardstyle about this ?   




 When do you guys think it will be released?  
























 Dude I know... BS2 gets hate sometimes but I loved it, while the story did have afew plot holes I felt it improved on everything else especially combat and atmosphere (plus Minerva's den is probably one of my fave DLC's of all time) 




 Didn't superman kill more people in MOS then Godzilla in the latest Godzilla film?
 




 Should I buy it? (I own all the bioshocks and love them all to death especially BS2)
EDIT: Bought SS2 and I'm really surprised on how well it holds up (game play wise any way) It was definitely worth the 3$ and I also am hearing some sound effects that were used in BS1   




 I found a bunk file in my uninstall, removed it and everything is fine now :)  




 At my school some kids have speakers in their back packs... Needless to say its fucking irritating  




 Thanks :) 




 Recently I downloaded VLC media player off a bad site and it screwed with internet explorer and chrome (slower then normal and pop-ups). I was able to find where the junk files installed and deleted the file and completely cleared my browser cash but chrome is still running slow and while it happens a lot less then before I'm still getting pop-ups. Virus scans show nothing (windows defender) (I don't know my specs from memory so I will update this later if need be). 




 Wow man! Thanks for this, I could never really pin down what nu-style was so I guessed as much but form the bottom of my heart... Thanks :) P.S. Yoji is awesome (still trying to find a place where I can buy airport :/) 




 One of Shingo's older songs, the kick isn't great and with youtube being what it was back in 09 the quality is a little rough. Look past that however and you will be hooked! P.S. If your into speedcore check out Shingo's other alias Round Wave Crusher (RWC) 









 I AM RADIATING HYPE LIKE A SUPER SAYAN! 




 I see what you mean 




 I use to draw the line at Gabber but now I've heard it all, Speedcore all the way up to extra tone. I traveled to the edge of the abyss, listened and enjoyed what I heard :^ ) 




 :( I didn't get to see the show because the the venue was 18+  




 Slum Village - Fall in love (Moody Good Remix) 




 Life with a monster girl..... ^^^^^^^^^^^Iwasneverhere 




 Captain: "Run full speed and just don't think about it"

Crew member: "But captain I don't think..." 

Captain: "Don't think about it"  




 OMG! That's the exact sign from FO3   FO:NV 

EDIT: Just rememberd that Bethesda was the publisher for this game 




 His FB page is still active but as for realeases IDK 









 I don't really know of any albums but have you tried hard trance? :) It's great for zoning out and quite a few of the songs I have heard have a bit of a sci-if feel to them :) check out the song "disarray" by Lisa lashes, Alex kidd   Kidd kaos (be sure to let me know if you need suggestions :D 




 Not exactaly what I'm looking for but thanks for showing me this :) it's got a really nostalgic vibe to it 




 Dose anyone know of any songs that have propaganda samples form WWII or The Cold War? 




 Do you guys know of any songs with samples of propaganda from WWII or The Cold War 




 He also tweeted at nanobii that he loved his music  




 Yes! Happy Hardcore FTW! If you like this track you might also like UK Hardcore and Hands-Up! 




 You mean Castles in the sky by DJ Satomi? That song is my jam! 









 Ohhhh.... I see what you mean and no I don't think so 




 Man... Qlimax 2006 looked like it was a lot of fun! Who did the anthem for this one? 




 I don't understand the question 




 NP :) 




 Neilio releases on labels like dirtyworkz and skranix (Hardstyle labes) 




 I haven't heard of any of those guys before! Guess I got to do some searching :)

 Also if your looking to get into freeform check out [Alek Szahala](http://youtu.be/uube-JJarcc) 




 Also while he isn't japanese, Shingo DJ/Round Wave Crusher has done a lot of touhou remixes and samples a lot of Hentai/Anime for his songs

 Remember when Prizyms first started posting Hardstyle to the sub? Well it's been a while and I have to ask, how dose everyone feel about hard dance now? I Actually love it more then I ever thought I would! I've been listening to genres I though I would always hate (speedcore and beond)  









 LOVE R.O. Belgian swing was amazing!  




 theirs a art to being a charming ass and Joel nails it  




 "Dike Martians" I guess monstercat's home planet was pretty kinky (   ) 




 He also loves hardstyle 




 Especially so if said artists have done work with noisia! 




 You guys should bug nick to get a reddit account 




 Maby a part for string bass? :D 




 It's awesome knowing that you like bee and puppy cat 

EDIT: what did you think of the first two episodes? 




 All we need is nick and the entirety of evol intent will be here 









 Computer club ILY M8 p.s. The liquid was amazing 3 




 Monstercat should meet a girl monstercat at some point. I think that would be cute 




 Prizymz actually is spinnin' (he dose their cover art) 









 If your not familiar with EVOL Intent, it is a group of three guys (one of those guys being bro safari) who mainly make DnB and have done songs with Noisia and give out a lot of their music for free over soundcloud  




 Your GQ comes with a free car, but you gotta pay tax  




 Ill do my best senpai!!!! (  ) 




 any idea where i can find some good reads on supersaws? :) 




 Dose anyone know of any good patches/tutorials? I have the FL signature bundle and harmor if that helps :) 









 [Downlink and Calvertron - Immortal (F3tch Remix)](http://www.beatport.com/track/immortal-f3tch-remix/5773480)

 









 TFW when you don't have a monstercat to snuggle with 




 Kawaii AF + DnB x nanobii - possible cover art by skrillbug if he chooses to finish this = ()*:	 




 It's one of the songs that got me started on trance  




 Wow that's a good remix! [heres a link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7UVCxcW46Y) to RWC's remix of reach for the moon immortal smoke 




 If your interested you should checkout some of shingo's other thohou remixes, he's done a lot. (He's also remixed a few songs as Round Wave Crusher) 




 I will do the best I can :) 




 Just downloaded Bad Boi   the uncaged remixes. Looking at my Traktor library I'm sitting on a lot of PBN songs, sooo mega mix anyone.... All the PBN songs I have (excluding the one's I can't mix nicely) originals and remixes 




 Not a huge fan of the kick in this one but if you look past it and listen to the melody you will be hooked!!!  









 That sounds awesome!!!! It could be a genre use to classify futile Japan style trance 




 Why can't people just leave the poor guy alone? 




 Plus more money to swery means a better chance of D4 Pt.2 coming out 




 Your pickles come with a free car but you got to pay tax on it 




 Swery should get a reddit account so people can ask him about clam chowder  




 I see him! 
 




 0_0 wow... And I thought Mordor was inhospitable before. This would actually be really cool in the movies though, a place where you are either freezing or super hot, all while being watched by the eye 




 Like pats many little babby yelps could be used for text notifications 

"AH!" Ooo it looks like I got a text 




 Oh wow :( I just got a really sad though in my head... It's of shep. Going into the gun room and seeing one of the those tags hanging from one of the guns and silently weeping because she got the Turian she loved killed 




 Ya up here in Wisconsin it gets down to -10 F at night 




 Come on man learn the lore, everyone knows the Asari evolved from crabs /s 




 you'd probably want WAV. or higher for modding 

EDIT: Actually you could use MP3's it just depends on how well compressed they are 




 I didn't notice the legs until you guys pointed it out.... jeez it looks like Liara was staying in the uncanny valley when this was painted   




 The thumbnail makes it look like shes doing [this](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121209083120/adventuretimewithfinnandjake/images/a/a6/Mckayla_is_Unimpressed.png), Cool shep. though! :D 




 Bring it here bro *opens arms for hugz* 




 I think they would make really cool one shots for DJing 




 I would really like one in red (purple is a sweet color but I've always liked the red hoods better)  




 Oh the fun I will have with this in FL 11 




 Freeform!!!! Check out Alek Szahala  




 You might like freeform :) it's a combination of hardcore and trance. [Check this one out](http://youtu.be/uube-JJarcc) 














 Woa... :0 thanks dude! 




 I've been getting into the genre lately and I was woundering if some one could give me some suggestions :) 




 Actually their all full tracks (with a few edits thrown in) 




 I accidentally deleted my comment with all the songs I linked :I I'll just give them to you and link them later 

Ophidian - Sounds of the machine 

Meander (Ophidian's crossbreed alias) - Greyscale

Angerfist - And Jeasus wept 

Kobaryo - Clock Control 

I:gor - The Devil has a name

Outside Agency - Hours   Dreams

S3rl - Feel the melody  




 Thanks man! 




 In E-force's song seven the tempo goes up at the second climax and then goes back to 150 for the next, dose anyone know what the tempo goes up to? I'm having a hard time figuring it out  




 If you showed him a pic of that he would block you on Twitter  




 Hard Dance: Kobaryo (he's already had a few releases on mob squad but it would be cool to see him bring the gabber sound to MC) 




 All right m7s let's get to know eachother a little better :), I absolutely love hard dance! If you don't know what that is it's stuff like hardcore, hardstyle, hard house, hard trance .etc 




 How did you get out of Skyrim with the war going on? (Torbjrn is the most Skyrimish name I have ever heard) 




 Scary monsters and nice sprites will always have a special place in my heart 




 Lisa lashes v.s Alex Kidd and Kidd Kaos - Dissaray (amazing hard trance) 




 Oh..... OH! Ow  




 During sophomore year (last year) this freshman girl came to school with face paint on. I'm talking full face cheeta patern..... P.S. You sound like a cool girl :) 




 toonie? 




 I remember back in middle school in the wake of COD black ops people would sharpen pencils to a dangerous point and whip them at each other while yelling "Tomahawk!" I think one kid got stuck in the leg with a colored pencil  




 I followed the advice given to me and I have to say I'm happy with how it turned out, I updated the [PP](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-dST9JfmygNvSEaYppJVyBqe36W_bYfXJMalfE6xZjU/edit?usp=sharing) and the [mix](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/hard-dance-lession-update) (this one flows a lot better), I also dropped Breakcore in favor of Tekstyle and I think a certain someone on this sub will be happy with my hardstyle song choice ;) *cough cough* /u/audiofrq     




 I know the pic he's talking about!! Allow me to do some digging 

EDIT: [Found it!](http://25.media.tumblr.com/bb0681713936b617bc3d3ac099dbaee7/tumblr_muqkczkYBi1s0aezvo1_250.png) sorry the image is so small

 Have you heard his latest album? One word... Lush 




 we must de-Liam them before the milk goes sour and makes woolie (and anyone really) vomit  




 Where do I sign up?!

 The R Is Silent is amazing! great combo of neruo and dubstep 




 Did anyone notice the ships shadow? It was like 20FPS  




 ...will help Liam pay off his vita, ...will help us get Liam out of the vents, ...will help Liam get gud, ...Will help save school girls from Liam (all I got for now)

EDIT: it should cut to Liam holding his vita crying and saying it was worth it surrounded by the 3 games the vita has 




 It would be cool to see this girl do a cover of bad apple 




 Probably ment to say "what the F" but engrish  




 He was trained by a master of CQC 




 0_0 I never knew you were on reddit! Also thank you for answering my question, I think I speak for everyone on here when I say that I can't wait! 




 Thanks! This will help a lot with kick making  




 So in less techinal terms it's the "Punch" at the beginning of the kick? P.s. Thank you :) 




 Sorry for the noobish question but I've been seeing the term a lot and I don't really have a firm grasp on it 




 It would be cool to see more electro from him but I have to say his mid-tempo stuff is my favorite 




 Check that reverse bass! 









 I remember reading some where that ophidian and Sam were working on something together, did anything ever come out of it? 




 If be fine with that especially if we get more songs like mirror mirror 




 Get your sides to send picks (especially of the clam chowder) 




 Yes yes yes yes!!! 




 Me too ^^^^choo^^^^choo 




 Sadly my presentation can only be 10min and putting showtek in there is just me forgetting to put "(older work)" next to them 




 Oh I didn't mean boring in that way, what I meant was if you find that it's becoming a slog or if your getting bored working on a track taking a little video game (or anything else really) break can be refreshing and will inspire/clear your mind 




 Hmmm.. You do have some good points, I'll rework it a bit and see if I can get a better progression out of it. Also before I replaced it with "worth fighting for" the song I had was Accelerate, the reason I changed it was it didn't think it went with all the other songs I have in the mix  




 Same with me but just remember when it starts to get boring a little break can make you feel awesome :) 




 VIDEO GAMES!!!
 




 Hello everyone! you may remember me as the guy who asked for euphoric hardstyle needed in a [mix for a school talent show](http://www.reddit.com/r/hardstyle/comments/2itn3g/a_call_to_everyone/), well here's an update. Me and my friend decided to do our own things for the talent show, it was after that I got to thinking "why just show people hardstyle when there's a whole genre of music (Hard Dance) I could expose them too". So after some work I have made a mix and a power point, I'm going to do a live mix while projecting the power point behind me. Each slide will have the genre of the current song, facts and what song is currently playing. This is where you guys come in, [heres a link to the mix](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/hard-dance-lession) [and heres a link to the PP](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-dST9JfmygNvSEaYppJVyBqe36W_bYfXJMalfE6xZjU/edit?usp=sharing), I've made it so you guys can leave notes on the PP in case I got any facts wrong. Thanks in advance :)  




 [Based freq gave a good explanation](http://www.reddit.com/r/hardstyle/comments/287r9t/holy_shtball_these_kicks_sound_like_nuclear/ci8ww6v) 




 I searched "kpop hardstyle" 









 He's soo cute 




 [ummmmmm](https://soundcloud.com/djmatduke/matduke-utopia) 




 IDK what arion's been up too and as for GQ he might be working on some music  




 Kai wachi hype! 




 Never never never never compare yourself to your favorite producer/s it never helps the creative process and it will make you feel bad about your self. I'm an aspiring hard dance producer and when ever I think I have a good kick I remember how sweet and amazing ophidians, audiofreqs, zatoxs, angerfists, nosferatus.etc kicks sound and I feel so bad. Take your time, watch some videos (seamlessR FTW) and most importantly have fun because if your not having fun your basically working a day job you payed 600$+ for 




 Link to the space fund plz 




 For those wondering where this is from, in the gal gun video Liam said that plague sent him a link to these. Oh plague senpai... (`) you with your ahegao faces and busty furry girls (still waiting on the fan art of the lizard girls from bug island plague)
 





























 YOOOOOOO!!!! I need more pat samples [Post them here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/2tslr7/dose_anyone_have_any_audio_clips_of_pat_they/) 









 yes... 




 Someone bug ultra pancake on twitter to make this happen NAO!! 




 I'm working on a song and all it needs is an angry leprechaun  









 Frenchcore is a genre, it's known for its punchy synthetic kicks 




 Hmmm, I get what your saying I kind of feel the same way about hands-up, plus this isn't the best example of a Frenchcore kick. [Heres a better example](http://youtu.be/ymzJeo-3b1I) 









 Rage is the embodiment of pure blackness and rage 




 Today class we will go over proper cunilingus edict "later during class" oops I droped my pen *gigles as she bends over to pick it up*  




 Thanks man! that was going to bug me... 




 I can't bleave I forgot it's name, it's the one where the girl puts a bag in between her legs and shakes her butt until she gets tired all while going "hado! hado! hado! hado!" 




 Sure thing! Frenchcore is known for its extremely synthetic punchy kicks [Heres a song by hellfish](http://youtu.be/EjKmr3lllsw) 




 RWC is making a Frenchcore alias the only thing is he can think of a name. So why don't we help him out! 









 F F F 3respektz5u 




 I really like Darude, his tech mix of "in the darkness" is fantastic 




 Venetian Snares, the things that man has made just blow my mind, 7/4 for life! 









 Not bad, the percussion was a little too loud, this has a lot of great ideas so just keep at it :) p.s. PM me one of your FLPs sometime it would be fun to collab with you 




 Ya pyramid head go ahead and take that pipe from Alex, he's a chode anyway 




 Occasionally you will hear a scream coming from rage's chest, when that happens rage sends out his soul to beat up the soul that screamed. 




 :O 




 Sorry :(, I feel pretty embarrassed now because I just figured out the beat grid, I was doing two notes per measure instead of 8 (I thought I was doing correctly). Sorry if I came off as a D-bag, no hard feelings? :( 




 p.s. RULES OF NATURE!!! 









 I've been doing that and I'm still not 100% happy with it and as for how it sounds [You'd be surprised](http://youtu.be/kM73tcr16Rs) 

EDIT: please don't down vote this. Everyone has a right to their own opinion but just because you don't like terrorcore doesn't mean you should down vote my post/comment   




 you might be wondering why anyone would want to go faster then 522, well that's because I'm making a terrorcore song and I want it to be 666 BPM :D, I've gone past 522 before but I cant remember how. Can someone help me out? 




 great song but not exactly what I'm looking for, come to think of it the stuff I'm looking for would probably be classified as Big Room/Main Stream house :/ any ways heres another [example](https://soundcloud.com/fiveandadime/5-a-dime-tempo-6-59-songs-in-an-hour-1) (start at 46:34) P.S. this mix actually has a lot of the kind of music I'm looking for      




 I'm looking for a certain kind of electro house. It's a little difficult to describe but I'm looking for stuff with massive build-up's and drops that focus on one crazy sound. [The best example I have is this song](http://youtu.be/UEDF_IRT9NM) 




 Sure thing :) 









 They haven't, I just posted this because the zaibatsu/people on here love Jojo :) 




 If it was the other way around it would be OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

 Those snoop samples just add so much! 














 just look at that smile! 









 Jeasus that red head was a bitch..... 




 The game really goes to shit in the second act when you go to town. Here's a list of reasons why the town sucks: 1. Grey brown and rainy, 2. zombies that are on fire 3. Zombies with helmets 4. Zombies with BASIC weapons that can do STUPID amounts of damage (they can also throw the weapons) 5. The Ram  




 Ain't that the truth, I completed one when I was still in the hotel and went up to like level 60 but all the weapons stayed at level 1 2 




 although she dose have a lazy eye... but I have to admit that she was the LEAST hate-able character from the game     




 Ya RWC gets it right 









 No Sam B 0/10 - IGN, in all seriousness this game looks like everything dead island should have been in the first place (I sold and re-bought dead island twice and pat was super right the game just falls apart around the end) I REALLY tried to enjoy it but I just couldn't  




 Chili dogs

 What show is it? 




 I think technically this is DnB but I don't care because this song is as happy as a rainbow milkshake  









 Its cool :)
 




 I haven't checked but I'm going to guess no, [do some searching on here](http://www.doujinstyle.com/forum/) I normaly hate torrenting but with most Japanese releases its the only way 









 Oh wow, so meany things.... But if I had to say one it would be a new appreciation for Japanese developed ps2 games  




 http://www.ppf2014.info/ found this awhile ago and I really love it  




 love this song!

 Ophidian is one of my favorites (also checkout his crossbreed alias Meander) 




 one of the more interesting trapstyle songs I have heard 









 Ha I wish, but seriously I am hyped for this! 




 I tried :( it's giving me an error now sadly I think I'll have to reinstall FL  




 :) 









 The most important thing is did you like it? 




 another one from you. This time its happy hardcore :3 




 if your looking to get into tech trance I would recommend Darude, I'm serious his rush album is great!  




 did you do the cover art for this priz? 




 dose any one know how to fix this? 




 Good: Ophidian, The Outside Agency, Nosferatu, Art of fighters, Digital punk, Massive New Krew, Radical Redemption, Meander, The Prophet, Yandere Complex and The Dark Oscillators 

Bad: Body Lotion (srsly wtf), You, Psycho 909, Tone, The Wild Motherfuckerz and The Donkey Rollers  




 Oh and for future reference, the stuff your looking for is called Happy Hardcore and/or UK Hardcore (just incase you want to find more :D) 




 I agree with you on the bass. Anyways if you like this then keep an eye on F3tch, he just released a collab with Gawtbass and he has an EP coming out on NSD:BL on the 26 









 Check out some [freeform](http://youtu.be/O2El0dpEYH0) this is a mix for a free compilation and the DL for said comp. is in the description :) 




 Woa.. I always thought it was just his website. That's awesome! 




 Since my last post did better then expected, I decided why not post some more Japanese music. This time it's Gabber :) p.s. Checkout more of Kobaryo's stuff, he is a god 









 EVE gave you a lot of good suggestions so check those guys out. The only other person I can think of that EVE didn't mention is DJ Shimamura (nanobii loves him) 




 Japanese DnB is like a milk shake. Sweet and satisfying! p.s. check out more of you's stuff, he's really good  









 But blur doesn't have a sound track by Noisia c: (I've never played blur and I'm not hating on it I just really love Noisia) 




 Ya I can definitely imagine driving down a highway to this. Sun setting as my Delorean rolls down the coast at 66MPH 




 Glad I could help :) 




 Made by me :), not asking for feed back on this just take a listen if you need to zone out for awhile    









 Oh! One last important thing, if you want to find some great music look for touhou remixes. Just search touhou schranz, hardstyle, hard trance, nu-style. Etc and your bound to find some good songs :) some of my faveorite songs being ice cheinsaw by moro nuclear blast by siromaru and bad apple by Shingo Dj 




 Words to live by  




 ooohhh.... name your price :) 




  Hello everyone, I was just looking at the reddit comments for the drift stage video and I noticed that some of you seem to like retro/80's synth music. So please; sit down, make yourself comfortable, pop a boner and let's circlejerk about some music! :)

*unzips pants* I'll start, I'm absolutely in love with the hotline Miami sound track, all the songs just fit so well, their psychedelic but still danceable. As for artist I love Mitch Murder if you don't know who he is then let me tell you why you should love him, 4 words: [He remixed Guiles theme](https://soundcloud.com/daataa/mitch-murder-guiles-theme) 




 Motherfuckers act like they don't know about [Mitch Murder](http://youtu.be/hugowO0sSrM)

P.S. If your still not convinced [heres](https://soundcloud.com/daataa/mitch-murder-guiles-theme) his remix of guiles theme 









 Oh massive circleZ isn't an artist, their compilation albums released by massive new krew, so far their have been 4 




 Sure thing :)

Edit: actually I don't know a lot of Japanese Hardstyle artists either :/ The two consistent artists I know of are Shingo Dj and Massive New Krew, again the thing I noticed is most artists produce all kinds of hard dance, not just Hardstyle 




 Fuck ya! Japanese hardstyle! 




 I look at who some of my fav artists are following on soundcloud 




 Heck yes 3 love roughsketch 




 Maybe an artists logo is hidden in the pic? 




 [Japanese stream hardcore 4 album preview](http://youtu.be/IZRvaeJUKjw) my favorite song from this album is clock control by Kobaryo, the melody is spot on 

[Massive Circlez 2 cross fade demo](http://youtu.be/IZRvaeJUKjw) all the Massive Circlez compilations are gold, most Japanese producers make all kinds of hard dance but the massive new krew consistantaly make Hardstyle so check them out

As for buying these... Well most Japanese releases I've seen are physical copy only and they are only available from various Japanese websites (so unless you speak Japanese or your browser translates it for you, you might have a hard time finding out if the CD's are still in stock / if they ship outside of Japan). the Japanese stream hardcore comps. Are on iTunes as for the Massive Circlez you might have to result to torrenting. I can PM you the torrent file if need be 




 It doesn't matter where their from :) let me rephrase my question "what is your favorite hardstyle producing country?" (Go indeapth about it, I like the food, the culture, the kicks. Etc) I should have clarified that, sorry :( 




 Japan FTW!!!

EDIT: I really like Japanese Hardstyle   Hardcore because their kicks sound a lot diffrent from most Italian / Dutch Hardstyle   Hardcore. Plus anime samples sound really cool if used well  




 You can find some defqon and q dance related stickers kicking around online (along with other events/festivals) I don't have any links for those sorry :( but if your into hardcore I do have a link to the MOH [store](http://store.mastersofhardcore.com/moh-car-sticker) 




 Woa man, forget music in your blood, its in your DNA, it's part of your biological code (I guess that's why you guys were called bioweapon huehuehue) 




 Ever wonder how pat stays so short and angry? Well now you know, pure 100% Irish piss  




 You can't imagine how much fun were having by atmosphere. Slug is a poet personal fav from the album being "say hey their" also check out their song "god loves ugly" 









 all while the Joestars cheer rage on for fear of being curb stomped  




 OMG! THE JOESTAR MEN v.s RAGE v.s DIIIOOOO!! 




 More like 1/4 of a man 1/2 of a man and a full pie theif 




 Let's get to know each other alittle better :) you don't need to say a lot about yourself if you don't want to so one little fact is all I ask.

My name is Ethan and I love mass effect! Biotic for life! (But you probably knew that I loved ME) 

Anyways I love all things hard (hard as in hard dance... I saw your mind in the gutter there) but seriously Hard house, hard trance, hardstyle, hardcore. Etc, I love everything about it especially hard trance (speaking of which if your into listening to music and gaming Hard trance+ME=bliss)  




 True that :) 




 Interesting.... Mind elaborating? 	(      )	
 




 For me it would have to be Seth Green. I would love to pick his brain a bit (also their should really be a ME robot chicken skit) 




 THIS SOUNDS LIKE A CONVERSATION THAT WOULD BE IN JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE!!!  




 sorry if these kind of posts are looked down on. if you want a good laugh I highly recommend checking out the rest of the page I got this from   









 I guess if your really, and I mean reeeaaaallllyyyy into being choked you would be happy 









 I'm still waiting on plague to draw some fan art of the lizard girls :T 




 Disclaimer!!!!!!: I did not make this! All credit goes to "NotAnAnimator" I saw how little views this video had and saw that it hadn't been posted here yet so I decided why not post it and help it get more views :) (sorry for any confusion) 









 Keep in mind this is a radio rip. So it could get better 









 In this off beat adventure set way up north in Canada a solider who is not well liked by his unit and a AI who wants nothing more then to destroy all of humanity fall in love and decide to run off across the small 30 mile island all while being pursued by the incompetent unit commander, the smoker, mutants with shotguns on their arms and the creators of the AI who know she's good deep down. Can our young lovers keep their gear from degrading? Will the solider ever put a point into psi powers so he can finally use kinetic redirection? Will the AI ever stop making fun of humans and their shitty skin and organs? I don't know maybe.... Ya maybe. Find out if your questions will ever be answered on April 11th, 1999 all while listening to a sound track that's made up of orchestral music and 1999 DnB and trance with lazy flanging to make it more trancy! 




 If I ever decide to have a fallout party I would like a sound track to match :) the only two songs I know of currently are [Paradise Falls by Geck-e](http://youtu.be/3VO6NBZNNAI) and [War never changes by Psycho 909](http://youtu.be/Ox9OvRvXebQ) 




 *Shodan procides to project a full body video feed in your cyber interface, as you ogle her sexy, luscious robo body you fail to notice a hybrid behind you. He procides to cave your skull in with a pipe and steal your cyber interface so the entire flesh can enjoy the fruits of their "mothers" body. You did not survive the adventure." (BTW in wrighting this I realize that people will probably think I have a thing for Shodan. I assure you I do not, I mean seriously have you seen her face? She is the definition of a butter face) 




 And a little stuffed vault boy  




 I think the closets were going to get to quantum is MTN Dew volt. Plus nuka cola doesn't help you acheve euphoria (I'm on /r/montageparodies a lot) although it would be cool to have a soda that doubles as a glow stick  




 I haven't laughed this hard at a MP in a while! Hats off to you man :) 




 L-look at you h-hack^er. B-b-being suc^h a c-ch^^ode with your b-blood and sh-shi^tty mu^^ssels, while I-I have the sweetest r-r-robo bo^^oty and roundest, b-bigg^est, soft-est^-est robo titt^^ie^s that y-yo^u will ne^ve^^r g-get to fe^el up with your stu-stupid fleshy h-hands   




 you can say that again  





























 All I see it two pepole bumping uglys, I don't see how this has anything to do with Liam  




 Just not an engraved one, their useless out here in the jungle, they provide no camouflage! Fuck dude I need to beat MGS3 (I'm stuck on volgin) 




 I love the bioshock idea It would be awesome to see a sprite of one of the ziabatzu in red and white sailor stripes 




 Nope! Just read the description of you want to know more :)  




 Hey dude I feel you, but it's already kind of spoiled because if you look at the thumb nail for future episodes you can see him in the thumbnails  




 [only the best](http://the-switcher.deviantart.com/art/Still-in-a-dream-Snake-Eater-37133975) 




 Matt I know you've been busy lately but if you ever find some time post more drawings!!! I love your stuff man 









 Hmmm /u/nin_ninja is onto something. How about instead for Liam it should be something vocaloid related like the twins heads as slippers or something 

EDIT!!!: their names are Len   Rin 




 Oh man, oh jeez, oh fuck, oh shit.... [The face when Matt comments on my thread](http://www.listal.com/viewimage/1403774h) 




 Holy shit that dager launcher tho 




 Hmmm so I'm not the only one 




 Dude.... Next time put a side warning!! My sides feel like that chick from saw 3, seriously though good find, also to the creator of the video having life is good play over the whole thing was just...... Perfect  




 If only guy could do a cameo

EDIT: the ziabatzu should go the the lake side hotel at some point and pat should get stuck between the hotel beds  




 Phew that got graphic... *cough* *cough* *cough* I think I need to go take a shower 




 I still need to buy those albums when I have 30 dollars  




 It's because he spits acid and is FUCKING INVISIBLE! Reptile is the ultimate waifu  




 ^^^^^yes 




 Pat was too gud  




 Mine was the duke nukem video, here's my thought process from that day. "Dum de dum I'm just going to watch some more videos on video games.... Wait duke nukem forever came out?! Oh man I got to watch that video! hmmm the two best friends? Never heard of them (After video) man that game looked bad, 15 years of hype all for that good thing I've never played duke 3D also those guys were hilarious I'm going to see if they have any more videos  




 You: Pssst.... joe, Joe, JOE!! Joe: "What!" You: Say it... Joe: "Sigh... [Good Grief]" 




 digging the art style! Very TF2 









 That mothefucker...... 




 Noob question! Why is September first such an important date? 




 The part where jack puts on the hat is so platinum  




 I'll do that! Thanks :) 




 I know that is says "jumped" in the title but I'm suspicious because a quick Google search of "jumped, jumped jumpstyle and jumped artist" reveals nothing nothing :(, also I know this is a jumpstyle/tekstyle track but this is the most active hard dance sub I know of 









 Matt oh suck it.wav 




 Every time you move them you should get a John cena quote. (Inserts rubber fist) "you can't see me!" 









 Neo Kanada sounds like the hypest shit!! I wounder if they have glowing neon blue maple syrup? 




 I'll come as the punisher, I'll hold their arms if you punch them in the stomach  




 I was stroking my nostalgia boner the other day remembering all the dumb/awesome ones, so tell me what's your favorite? 









 I understand, Speedcore isn't for everyone :P 




 My sides feel as if the boss practied her CQC on them 




 mystery box 1 ! Matt said something about how french animation is really bad 




 now I know what your probably thinking "this sounds like shit and its really quiet" well your right but don't worry I WILL finish and master this properly (with the help of friends if necessary) I really want to make it...... Perfect    




 but will it be released? that is the question (I hope it dose I liked mirrors edge) 




 I think he did actually, way back during the hideous remix compition if you messaged BOS with a proof of purchase they would send you a sample pack 




 Nope, it's a subground kick ;) check out QULT if you want to hear more music like this  




 Mabey try a diffrent genre in the same vein like subground or hands up 









 The torrent for Caligo isn't working for me :/ is anyone else having problems? 




 Oh god damn it Liam got into kill la kill 




 RULES OF NATURE!!!! 




 I think I see what he means 




 Kind of a odd question to ask here, but I know that a lot of Hardstyle producers use it 




 Gabber - [Ophidian - Butterfly (VIP)](http://youtu.be/KddV9Hq9P8Q) 




 Gabber 4 life! 




 Is their any place I can still get camelphat? Or is it gone for good :( 




 That's awesome! I found a [video](http://thecrystalmethod.com/slam-academy/) of the crystal method event for anyone interested  




 What do you play now? 




 Have you ever met one of you favorite artists at a festival or in public? I haven't but man do I have a story for you. I went on a trip to Austria last summer (very nice place by the way) once I landed and left my gate I had some time to kill so I decided to look at the people coming through the gate. I notice a guy wearing a destroid hat but I don't think much about it, 5 minuets later I realize that guy was Excision (I kicked my self a bit but I got over it) later I'm browsing Facebook and I see a post that ken from the crystal method is coming to the twin cities to talk about production at a FREE class. Needles to say I was upset 




 What's the opinion of hard dance on this sub? I'm having a hard time gauging it 









 FL user! I love all kinds of hard dance (hard trance, Frenchcore, hardcore, hardstyle .ect) so HMU if your interested and I'll give you my Skype, the best way to contact me is through PM because I never use Skype unless I know someone's going to call, so PM me on here before you message/call me on skype I'm still new to the production world but I know afew things, also I do have harmor if that matters 

SC: https://m.soundcloud.com/infernal-imp 




 thats pretty much all their is too it :) 




 My man!!! All right this should be easier to explain. Let's say you have your melody, pads and bass routed to channels 1, 2   3 respectively. You'll find a send knob/button at the bottom of each mixer channel, click on it and then click on the send of the channel you want to route too let's say 4 in this case (it should say for example route 1 to 4 in the top left corner if your doing it right) after you've routed all your channels you now have what is called a bus, you can now EQ, distort, compress and side chain everything that is routed to mixer 4 just automate the channel volume slider and bam their you have it :) all of your melodic elements are now side chained! The best part is that if you need to change something you only need to change the one automation. Busses are also great for blending percusive elements like kicks and snares, hope this helps! 




 Yes, also what daw are you using (depending on which one you are using I might have to explain it a little differently) 




 I actually do have afew connections, I have a friend who has done remixes for and knows the crystal method. I have a friend who MIGHT know Eric prydz and also has a friend at rotten. (He has afew more connections but I forget who/what they are). As for artists, I'm a massive fan of hard dance so pepole like angerfist, ophidian, da tweekaz, DJ thera. Etc. P.S. Thanks :) 









 Sure thing :), I have been producing for about a year so I am still a beginner but I have been playing bass since 4th grade (I'm a high school junior now). I use FL studio because I love the piano roll and interface. As for the mentor someone who can teach me synth programming or give me ideas like "this noise would sound good for the fill" also someone to bounce ideas off of. As for the remix it is "voices in my head (redo)" by round wave crusher 




 As the title says I'm looking for a mentor. Someone who knows a good deal about electronic music, currently I am doing a remix for one of my favorite artists and I really want it to be special. Left to my own devises I don't think it will turn out very well. Let me know if you're interested :) 




 I'll get it from him today :) 




 [Heres a link to mine](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/j-core-set-for-tallent-show) 









 thanks for the patch bassed harmor bass god of bass........... bass 




 Thanks but this isn't exactly what I'm looking for :/ im trying to make a kick like [this](http://youtu.be/xThLTxVVfhw) start at 1:03 




 Can someone explain the process/show me any good tutorials? I'm really interested in making hard trance  




 If you do get fl splurge a little bit and get harmor 




 this ezo shall pierce the heavens  




 I read that as woolie the pie stealing moe at first..... 









 I like the way this guy thinks 




 someone spilt their vocaloid in my Jojo and I'm ok with that 




 Post your stupid crossovers and/or ideas here! Mine is "what if the crucible had stands?" Seriously think about how cool that would be "goody nurse did you send out your stand in the middle of the night to terrorize these girls? I did no such thing your honor, my stand only heals and calms. We shall see about that! Adoadoadoadoadoaodaodadoado!!!!!"  




 You can get some really good sounds with this thing and the best part is that it's 100% free! They have more emulators but sadly they are reason exclusive :/ 














 Utopia  




 Did you see hear the track he released a little while back? 




 http://touhourecords.blogspot.com/?m=1 For what you can't find on doujinstyle look here 









 I think hard trance would also fit well 




 Surprisingly well actually  




 Last Friday me and my friend did DJ sets for our school talent show 

[Here's my friends set](https://soundcloud.com/noah-zins/d-days-live-set) it's a deep/electro house set

[Here's my set](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/j-core-set-for-tallent-show) it's a j-core/hard dance set 




 What!?! He didn't shave down the grip! 




 Man we need some gabber artists on monstercat  














 Ahhhh!!! This album is so good I'm so happy that 1/2 of 16bit is still making music!!! 




 Mainly dancing and singing acts (some better then others) 




 People went crazy! Especially during bad apple   clock control 




 Ya Shingo really loves touhou, he did the same thing in his [remix of native faith](http://youtu.be/8giKbzcxA-E) 




 Ya dude! I was hyped when I got the greenlight 




 thanks, I had to do pretty lazy transitions because it had to be under 10 minuets :) 




 it's a DJ mix, the whole thing was suppose to show my talent as DJ :) 




 I don't really have a say in it because none of the music is mine but I'm fine with it  




 well I say talent show... really it was an all school thing that you didn't even have to audition for (their were some pretty bad acts). also for anyone willing to make an OSU! map, knock yourself out 









 Ya man the gabberbox covers have that classic 90's horror feel to them plus their really good old school compilations! 




 I know this really isn't the place to be asking this kind of question but I could really use some help. I've been interested In making old school hardcore and the one thing that is troubling me is the kick, I just cant get that old school sound, Distorting is no problem its just getting the old school character. Any help is appreciated :)

[How I want it to sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EypIMWFGnWU feature=youtu.be)

[What I get (Synthesized 909)](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/old-school-kick-demo-synth) 

EDIT: [Found this video](http://youtu.be/FrFLz7LVGp0)
    




 I've been doing that and I'm still not getting the sound [I want](http://youtu.be/EypIMWFGnWU) 




 I'm having a hard time getting the right sound can someone help me/know of any tutorials? 




 As long as it's in key with the music and not to high pitched then I can [dig it.](http://youtu.be/qn9AeUK-jG4) [Nightcore](http://youtu.be/JThz8-nYYHs) on the other hand.... 









 Also check out the organ donors FB they released a zip file with all their 2014 tracks for free 




 Not all hard trance is like this but most of the stuff I listen to is, some recommendations I have are Lisa lashes, Kidd Kaos, Alex Kidd, dark by design, ASYS, geck-o and the organ donors. P.S. Listen to [this](http://youtu.be/erZJu-x41hQ) it's what got me into hard trance :) 









 The lead is amazing c: 




 We finally get another Excision   Space laces collab!  




 You dose it again! 









 Ohhhhhhh!!! *airhorns* *memes* *euphoria* 




 You have broken into your favorite artists studio, you find their computer and begin transferring files to your hard drive when you hear a commotion afew rooms away. They must have heard you! In the small amount of time you have you figure that you can only take one patch, what patch do you take? Personally I would take the screech patch from firestorm by digital punk (soo raw!) p.s. I do not condone the breaking into/theft of any producers homes and or studios :) 




 fuckin Kevin man... 




 nooooooo...... at least let me take off my pants!!! 




 [...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYT66ALUUss) 









 Us shitlords over at /r/twobestfriendsplay are also sending out our love, while the ziabatzu didn't talk about him a lot (they mentioned him a few times on the podcast) a lot of fans (including myself) found out about Monty's hospitalization and death through the TBFP sub and we are all saddened your guys loss. EDIT: Currently 22 other subs have posted the article from the RT site!  




 I never picked up on that part (the being useless part that is) 




 Okuu + Schranz = 3 









 His whole "GnB" Album is fantastic! Download it for free NAO! 









 If you see Swiper say: MY STAND WILL BE THE JUDGE!!! P.S. the guy who made this was inspired by [this](http://avielsusej.deviantart.com/art/Dora-la-Bizarra-ExploraDORARARARARARARA-368100133) comic and yes steal my comment from deviant art 




 http://youtu.be/rUF4H5VUk5k

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBIf0OgZffU 




 Im talking Jojo, space jam and everything else that is stupid and awesome! 




 Le omg what is this crap XDdDXD, I'm 12 and I love the classics like queen, the stones .ect le sigh if only I was born in another generation 









 Some of you might be thinking "haven't I heard this before?" Well you might have because he sampled the song "on nature of daylight" from shutter island. Checkout more of goreshit's stuff he gives it all out for free!  









 This is goreshit's YouTube channel (if you really need me to re-submit this I will) P.S. I'm not trying to start a fight with you I promise, I love all the mods on this sub and the last thing I would want to do is make one of you guys angry 




 Some of you might be saying, "haven't I heard this somewhere before?" You probably have because he sampled the song "on the nature of daylight" from shutter island. Be sure to check out more of goreshits stuff, he gives it all out for free! 




 lets say I rout track 1 to track 2. is it possible to Un-rout them or am I committed after that point?   




 You to dude 




 It's cool :) Frenchcore is a kind of hardcore, the main difference is the kick [heres a good example of one](http://youtu.be/j7UVCxcW46Y) 




 thanks man! This is a little off topic but do you know of any good 909 sample packs? (Free or paid it doesn't matter :) ) 




 Try out some different daws, get afew sample packs (free or paid) and most importantly HAVE FUN (if your not having fun then theirs no point) 









 It's cool that you don't know genres :) from the sound of this I'd say that it's some kind of house 









 trying it out now
EDIT: a lot better
 




 Bleave it or not view distance was the only thing I didn't turn down... 




 Fingers crossed, friend 




 Same thing happens to me  




 Other then the fact that I'm running everything on low and my frame rate still manages to take a massive shit at points, dying light feels smart, tense and fun   




 And on the ground next to him are the 4 games the vita has 




 EDIT: Yoooo! Keep em coming guys! :) 




 Sure thing dude bro girl, love your stuff! P.S. srsly I would love to see /u/dustingv idea drawn  




 Oh I'm not ultra pancake :) I'm just a fan who found this on her DA and saw that it hadn't been posted here 




 Na, anything you got really 

EDIT: some of him raging/screaming would be nice, anything else is just gravy  
























 I'm betting that a lot of you have seen this video but it hasn't been posted here before so I figured why not :), the editing in this video is really good and with out sounding like a Canadian maple tree, it makes me proud to be part of this scene  




 Recently I've been listening to the Highstreet allstars and I've noticed somthing. A lot of their songs use old melodies, like their track freeze is "what do we do with a drunken sailor" 3kings is (I'm spacing right now but it sounds really familiar) and rock that beat is an old Celtic song called "son ar christr" I think it's pretty cool when artists put a spin on classic melodies. I want to find more songs, hardstyle or otherwise thanks in advance :) 




 I'm still a beginner so don't be too hard on me :)   https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fqsax6flnvqwcqd/AABlGrvugc4g-8R_6xj4NNuia?dl=0

QUICK EDIT!: use these how ever you see fit! Just be sure to link me the songs made with them, I'm interested to see what you guys come up with :) 




 thank you Sam, I always love these story's 

EDIT: I love "Lad Riffs" Hahah, Steriophobia, Superstar DJ, Fucking posers (maybe I need to listen to that song again) and Do you wanna ballon? Man... You just made me realize that I need to listen to more old hardstyle  




 Holy shit... Is that Dio in there? 




 Yes? :(... It doesn't have to be a kick you worked super hard on  




 Post a project file and a WAV. Render, doesn't matter what DAW you use and it doesn't matter what kind of kick it is, it can be a normal distorted kick, a reverse bass, a hardcore kick heck I'd even be down for a nice gated kick. I think it would be cool to see how we all make our kicks and maybe help out those who are having trouble. I'm not at my computer right now but I'll post some files when I am :) 









 Niiiiiiicccce, good mastering on this, I have afew criticisms (if you are the guy who made this) the reverse bass sounds like it could be a little more distorted and while I understand what you are trying to do with the vocals they sound a little boring, maybe you could get a girl friend to do the vocals and give it that aggressive human element. Besides the two things that I mentioned everything else is their, good job on this one :)
    




 [Right here!](http://kinzoku.xxxxxxxx.jp/tmfgh.html) 




 It is illegal, but only in certain ways (   ) 









 I get really worked up sometimes, at points I'm on top of the world and at others I'm getting my ass kicked by little girls, I've only played EOTSD and Faith Mountan, Meiling always kicks my ass because I can never read her patterns, I remember barely scraping by her once only to be killed before I reached the first boss encounter in the level then having to go to the score screen and have sakyua silently judge me with her dead unmoving eyes and go alllllllll the way back to the beginning, I just want to fight sakyua ;_;. Then in faith mountain Momiji's bullet patterns always make me panic so I end up wasting all my bombs  




 will the based freq tell us a story? /u/audiofrq plz 









 and its fixed! thank you!  




 Oh, sorry I'm not home right now so I couldn't check (the screenshots aren't mine I just used them as an example) thank you :) 




 Thank you but again that's not what I ment, I'll try to be very specific this time :), ok so normally when you put a pattern in the playlist, the notes show up as a [greyish white](https://audiodestrukt.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/fl-live-playlist.png), I think a accidently hit a key or something along those lines because now when I put a pattern in the playlist the notes show up [colored](http://cdn.mos.musicradar.com//images/Tutorial%20images/Tech/fl-studio-tips/fl-studio-slicer-460-85.jpg), seriously though thanks for your help, I'm learning things I didn't know before :) 




 Sorry, what I mean is the actual notes inside the pattern are showing up colored like green, purple and blue all inside one pattern  




 How do I make [this](http://youtu.be/6x5RshIRrno) FX kick? It starts at 0:56 and you can also hear it multiple times starting at 1:55 




 My main complaint is that you can't set a decay time, meaning that the kick tail could be a minute long if you wanted it to be, otherwise this is a great little Vst. it's got some pretty good presets and one of my favorite producers I:gor worked on it [get it here](http://distocore.net) 




 Me too, I am also very interested in this  




 Harmor can also do this  




 I love how obvious it is that Sam is doing the vocals for this one 

EDIT: fantastic reverse bass, a lot of my favorite reverse bass tracks come from Bioweapon/Audiofreq  









 If you have FL I recommend [this guys](http://youtu.be/nFI2CdFY_3M) tutorials he also makes hardstyle if your interesed (hardstyle kicks can teach you a lot about kick making) also try synthesizing your own kick tails it's alot of fun and it gives it that personal touch  




 I fucking love this artist, his/her art style is so cool 




 Ima fite u m8 




 They had potential, I was a huge fan of live for the night but eventually they just dropped off my radar, I never really liked the girls that much like what /u/Nezzatic said, a bit trashy. They got my attention with United kids of the world but in all honesty it wasn't that good of a song, it felt like Headdy and the girls could have done better and now with the whole rainman thing why even bother, I mean they lost their producer, where do they go from there?

EDIT: I forgot about party monster! Huge fan of that song production was fantastic  




 I would love to see a video of that 




 I like it, simple yet refined

Edit: or how about what ever Gabes wife's name is, because behind every God is a Goddess  




 what should we name her? It should be something elegant, something powerful, something that encapsulates the essence of PC gaming   









 *desperation for full comic series intensifies*  




 hmm I don't know much about about ambient but that doesn't mean I still cant help you :) [try this one on for size](http://freesamplepacks.net/dark-ambient-sounds/)       




 Ah I understand, ok let me re-answer I don't know of any cheap daws but their are plenty of free vst's and sample packs just waiting to be found, check out this sub, along with Google, also what kind of music are planing on making? 




 we cant link you any torrents on here but do some hunting if you really want to.   




 oh how dumb of me!! filters, why didn't I think to use filters! (ga!) thanks for the enlightenment friend :D  









 Thank you, so if I wanted a 3 band one I would just do the same thing except with 3 tracks and I would cut the mids from one? 




 I know their are plenty of plug-ins/vst's but I'm really interested in making my own, I use FL so if anyone could point me towards any tutorials or explain the process to me that would be fantastic :) thanks in advance  




 Ohmicide, it's a pretty nice multiband distortion unit but I can never get anything I like out of it. 









 Lights laugh/face during the laugh...... A sweet cherry on top of a great Sunday also I paused it when I was watching it with my friend and said "that face is someones wallpaper" 




 DYK that Dan Green did voice acting for bible black? 




 Or it could be played first given that it's the slowest/saddest so the hype ratchets up as the party goes on, also as a special bonus a plague of gripes set with all grey lights and music consisting of [noise](http://youtu.be/2toGkIfGFVU) and creepy animal sounds 




 Duuuuude! TBF warehouse party! Everyone wares pop culture/anime/hype shirts and we have a 4 hour party with a 1 hour set for each member, the music and lighting changes for each one

Woolie: all green lights with a set consisting of fighting game themes and rap that ends with the sound of rock salt being poured into something 

Pat: red, yellow and orange lights with a set consisting of silent hill music that moves into Irish folk songs and heavy metal

Liam: pink, yellow and light blue lights with a set consisting of j-core, j-metal and anime remixes 

And finally Matt: red, white and blue lights with a set consisting of 80's action movie themes, wrestler themes and platinum games ost's also throughout the set you can hear predator growling and for the slow dance with Matt and his wife; snake eater.  









 Great seeing more of angerfist around here 




 Wow... I had no idea kidd kaos made stuff like this. I've always loved his hard trance but this is fantastic! Thanks for sharing :) 




 I was thinking I could set up a plug.dj room and I could do a mix consisting of rap, video game ost's, electronic music and other stuff. Plus we could all chat and have fun. Let me know what you all think :) 




 I beat peace walker! Now all I need to do is grow a beard and play ground zeros and my indoctrination into the MGS series will be complete! Then the wait will officially begin for me 




 Is their a cut off year for this? Because if not I can't wait for him to play quantum of solace that game was better then expected  




 Perfect  




 Kick making :) as you can probably tell by my flair kicks are a big part of the music I make, weather it be the over driven sound of a gabber kick, the dry dusty omf of a gated kick (gated kicks are commonly used in hard trance), the aggression of a frenchcore kick, the power of a hardstyle kick or the solid thunk of a UK hardcore kick. Theirs something about synthesizing or editing one from a sample pack that is just so relaxing and fun, plus it's so cool to hear how just a little EQing can change so much about the character of a kick 




 I like to imagine his mom calling him down for dinner while he's in the middle of this. 

Mom: (in French accent) Hugo come down and have soup


Him: (in angry french accent) not now mom this mix down is giving me problems ;_; 




 This is the only [speedcore lable](https://www.speedcore.ca) I know of 




 Neeeevvverrrr compare yourself to your influences it never helps the creative process at all. Simply keep doing what your doing and most importantly HAVE FUN! 




 I know what you mean, I just wanted to show the whole sound spectrum so I got a little lazy plus the last few notes of the melody just don't sound right to me (I found some midi online) 




 Wrestling, my friend just ate it up, he bought so many DVDs, toys and even that wwe car combat game 




 [heres the patch](https://www.dropbox.com/s/06qhr8ecvzixmp9/dreamy%20pluck.fst?dl=0)
[heres the FLP](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fgqsiw0eju5zhi2/pluck%20test.flp?dl=0)
and finally [heres how it sounds](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/pluck-test), enjoy and be sure to link me any songs you've made with it (you don't need to credit me I'm just interested to see what you come up with)  




 Hey it's cool, the more you know right? It doesn't surprise me that it was figure he loves horror, his monsters albums are one of the many things I look forward too in October  




 But then theirs [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/2yfzlp/nnn_message_gabber_2014_japanese_hardcore_is_so/) 




 I can understand :P I personally love terrorcore but at points it dose get to be too insane/gross, also was the person you walked out on [this guy](http://youtu.be/dx99U5KcwNQ) 

EDIT: I'm supposed to tell you why I like it! I like it because it's fast and it's frantic and some of the people who make it are masters of drum programing. Also it's just diffrent and it shows how you can take a concept like horror and turn it into awesome music! Check out [this mix](http://youtu.be/kM73tcr16Rs) 




 the dark oscillators used to be made up of Luca antolini, technoboy and tuneboy (and afew other people) so check them out 




 I've seen more and more hardcore submissions get more upvotes lately... Gabber's gaining ground ;)  




 Ohhh shittt! Good idea dude! Super best animators 1 hour podcast we would finally get to hear 2snacks sexy Brazilian accent, hear Cranky confess how he's a furry and has been hiding it (kind of) all these years and finally hear zone talk about ~~her~~ his dick shading techniques, also I know I'm making a joke but I really want this to happen, like really badly 




 Or the moans of various cartoon charters throughout only to be hushed by some unknown horror  




 Also dose zone have a reddit account? If not ~~she~~ he should get one 




 I already know about POS and Noisekick and I need more! I'm really in love with terror right now, thanks in advance :) 




 Who would be the super intendant? My money's on RAGE, he would just kick down someone's door and proclaim I AM HERE TO FIX THE LEAKY PIPE! Also if this ever happens I would volunteer to be a writer in a heartbeat  




 I would like to imagine that all the people who do creepy sex stuff use the dungeon and none of them know that someone else uses it too. So their could be moments of "how did this horse dildo get here?" "What's up with this ball gag?" And a one point their could be an episode where they all meet, it would open with Plague doing some creepy animal thing and Yahtzee would walk in waring his gimp suit and they would lock eyes and then Jole from vinesause would walk in waring a Kermit the frog mask  




 What if Yahtzee moved in next door, they would think that a very vocal British Australian political journalist moved in  




 2swood4me 




 and then above Gav and Micheal is Jon Tron just eching it up all day and a running gag could be they think he's a chain smoker because all they hear coming from the apartment is ECH! ^^^ECH! ILL GET MY SWOOORRDDD DANNY!!!  




 Round wave crusher 

Kobaryo 

Angerfist

Noisecontrollers 

Ophidian 




 Round Wave Crusher, he has a new album coming out very soon and he's the the person that introduced me the whole
J-core scene. I know a lot of people on here don't like fast music (200 and over stuff) but seriously give him a chance, it takes awhile to get used to fast music but once you do, you will want to hear more! Believe me I know I used to absolutely despise anything over 200. Anyways here's one of my favorite songs by him, the melody is so dark and catchy, may I present to you.... [Voices (in my head)](http://youtu.be/UWaCPTgUNsk) he also did a redo of this on his Unhinged E.P.

EDIT: also You, You just blows my mind on so many levels, he makes really good happy hardcore but at the same time he can do incredibly fast music very well. He also has anime remix albums up on his site for free, check him out at [foryousounds.com](http://www.foryousounds.com) 




 No problem :) 




 I sure do! [This is my favorite song by him](http://youtu.be/AHVBBWwB1Io) he also makes hardcore under the name ophidian if your interested

EDIT:[album showcase](https://soundcloud.com/sebastiaan-kleinjan/gazing-long-into-the-abyss-album-showcase) 




 Fuck yes! Thanks for adding it to the list dude. Also have you ever heard of meander? He's one of my favorite crossbreed artists  




 Oops, looks like I need to get gud 




 Your forgetting one genre (depending on if you like it)... Crossbreed, crossbreed is a combination of DnB and hardcore, really cool
stuff check out "The Outside Agency" if you want to hear some (they are the founders of the genre) otherwise flawless list dude it's nice to see someone so dedicated to a genre they love 




 Oh man oh jeez their are so many things I need to do, I need to upgrade my pc, I need to buy more MG's games and I need to send in my PS3 because the disc tray is broken :/ 




 rules of nature?
 




 taken from the dying light video 









 The vid quality is bad, but the part about the home work made me laugh really hard 









 One of the better Schranz aragements I have heard in a while! Also for those who don't know... Schranz is a kind of hard techno that focuses on phat, chunky rolling beats rather then the kicks  









 Fuck I still need to buy peace walker, and then buy ground zeros and then get super hype for September 1 




 The Simpsons is my favorite anime  














 to who ever did this.... thank you 




 Captain were taking on too much lewdness, we may need to start evacuating the crew soon 




 Not my favorite hardsound album but it has my favorite cover art I mean seriously just look at that shade of pink... Also I should make a confession. I got into Touhou through the musical arrangements I heard on YouTube, weather it be hardcore, jumpstyle, schranz or hardstyle I would listen to it. Also I've only played two of the games, embodiment of the scarlet devil and faith mountan  









 *gets up from fireplace* what an interesting story also wow Australian born Colombian you must have had a diverse childhood 









 Maby if we're patient Uncle Sam will tell us the story behind this one 




 Yes! thank you  




 I remember it was one of those "I'd like some feedback on this" kind of posts and everyone really seemed to like it, it was a Rawstyle track and a remix (possibly) thanks for in advance! 




 Dose anyone think their should be a Noisia version of the discovery movie? 




 I did ;) [heres a link to the thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/2uw03m/lisa_lashes_alex_kidd_vs_kidd_kaos_nu_religion/) 




 Hey wait a minute I remember you! Your the guy who asked for hard trance suggestions :D how have you been enjoying it so far? 




 check out QULT 




 Heres the [FLP](https://www.dropbox.com/s/45av9r0srbhrkdd/Devestate%20Dominate%20Eleimiate.flp?dl=0)
Right now its just samples from the blutonium hardstyle sample pack, im hoping to make it a lot more and a lot better! have fun with it  :) 









 This is hardcore ;) 




 Strobe 









 Me too man 




 Believe it or not he actually has a hardstyle alias, sadly he's only [released one song under it](http://youtu.be/0wXZJues_bs) 




 I'm really hoping for some Gabber in the near future 




 [Try this mix on for size](http://youtu.be/HIw1DsZD8NA) it's a tech trance mix, if you don't want to listen to the whole thing just look at the track list in the description, all the artsists listed make really good tech :)

And if you want to get into hard trance [heres one of my favorite mixes](http://youtu.be/erZJu-x41hQ) and a [mix I did](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/exploring-the-dreamscape) 




 Wow! This is actually pretty good, the kick sounds like it's pushing the melody out of the way a bit but otherwise it's really good 




 As we all know 16bit broke up awhile ago and awhile later Eddie Jefferys came back as MoodyGood (bless him his sound design is amazing) but what happened to Jason? I remember hearing that he started making trap as "we are the 13" or something like that, theirs even a link to his SC on the old 16bit FB page but it's a dead link :/ so dose anyone know what happened to the guy? 




 Fuck yes I love angerfist, this whole album is a winner, also did you know that gabber started in the Netherlands? And that the listeners were usually punks and outcasts who were just looking for something to do? Gabber has an interesting history

 You might want to ask this on /r/edmprouction nice pepole and you will get some good advice :) also I use Vocodex and I really like it 









 "Teaches ages 12-16 years old" :0.... Excuse me mr. visi- I mean mr. (What ever the visions last name is) I think I hurt my ankle, could you take escort me to the nurses office? *On the way there* sooooo... Whats your go to synth, what distortion modal is your favorite and will you check out my mixtape? 




 Hello everyone! As the title says I need some help with making a subground kick, Specifically [this one](http://youtu.be/sYZcgn-sJho) it sounds to me like a big room kick with some distortion and some EQing to bring it out a bit, any guesses on how this kick was made would be great! Also if you make subground why not share some info on your kick making process (/u/audiofrq) I'm looking at you ;) thanks much 




 sure thing dude  




 Maybe try this? http://www.vitorrent.cc/search/camel+audio+alchemy+1.5 




 Sure thing dude, I don't know of any but I'll take a look for you. Also *gives pat on back* 




 Sure thing dude! I'll link you the site where I get most of my Japanese stuff (most of it is physical release only so I have resort to a lot of torrenting/unofficial downloading :/) [here](http://touhourecords.blogspot.com/?m=1) although you can find some stuff on iTunes, if you find it for free but also find it on iTunes buy it to support the artist! unofficial downloading/torrenting is a last resort for me 




 Here are some artists 

Dutch: Angerfist, Neophyte, The Viper, Nosferatu, Endyminion, The Playah and Ophidian

Italian: DJ Mad Dog, AniME, The Art Of Fighters, Amnesys, Nico and Tetta and Meccano Twins

Japanese: DJ Noriken, moro, DJ Sharpnel, Kobaryo, t+pazolite, kenta-v.ez., Noizenecio, RoughSketch, DJ Myosuke and 6th

As for records: Angerfist - The Deadfaced Dimension, Nosferatu - Nocturnal By Nature, Ophidian - Between The Candle and The Star (this one is reeeelly good!), Art of fighters - Words of war, DJ Sharpnel - The Sharpnel sound albums, moro - The Gensou hardsound compilations, If your looking to get into old school hardcore the gabberbox compilations (their fucking expensive though $30 a pop) and if your looking to get into speedcore the Psycho Filth Records 500 over!, 600 over! and 666 over! Compilations, I have 666 over! and it's frickin sweet! 




 Sure thing man, check out the Japanese Stream Hardcore compilations, Japanese Hardcore sounds a lot diffrent from most Dutch/Italian Hardcore 




 Mainly the melodys and saw synths, also the kicks, some pepole just really like the aggressive sound 




 Thanks for the advice. but I still am curious, is their a way to get them to work with FL? 




 Recently I found out about this --- http://www.phuturetone.com and I was wondering if I could use rewire some how to make the plug ins work in FL or dose rewire not work that way?

Edit: I should probably clarify that I only have FL studio 




 Ask some one who already has it, I know that producers sometimes keep installs to give to friends. If you don't know anyone with it you will have to torrent it :/ 




 Do you have sytrus? 









 "Dante chases rage" what?!? Rage runs from no man Rage dose not understand the concept of being chased, the games are rages equivalent of a vacation 

"Blanka and rage tell story's to eachother" Blanka: I can't wait to see my mommy Rage: this one time I destroyed a skyscraper just by looking at it..... HAHAHAAA! 




 This guy gets it  









 Unf... Those kicks! Also check out the gensou hardsound compilations, there fucking awesome (this song isn't on any of the comps though) 









 An odd thing to post here but believe me when is say all of these tracks are fantastic despite being so fast, if your looking to get into fast music check this one out along with their 500 Over! and 600 Over! Compilations  









 holy shit dude! bring snacks because we need to get to the [bunker](http://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1390/58/1390580499294.gif)
  




 this happened to me also, I shot Sam an email and he sent me the DJ edit and the radio edit. (Sam's a cool guy) just shoot him an email if apple dosn't get back to you :)   




 stamp on the ground by the italo brothers 
 




 nightcore at its most basic level is just any song sped up about 10-30 BPM at that point you get warping and people who enjoy that are people who I distance myself from. on another level people actually remix the track but I'll just stick to happy/UK hardcore   




 if your an anime fan checkout star driver  




 man... Matt looks really good with glasses 




 That was awesome! and then the part with the revolvers, and after ocelot is just like see us later fuckers and peaces out in the dumbest/best way possible 




 Alright alright alright! Thanks dude 




 Oh man that cock block ending tho 




 Fuck ya man! [Spoiler](#s "just to be sure your talking about the fight between ocelot and snake right?")  




 Quick question for ground zeros... Digital or physical copy, am I missing anything if I buy digital? 




 I fucking did it! I beat it! 
























 Forget muda muda muda, it's all about bang bang bang! 









 It's glorious ;_; I wonder what Dio's wrestling federation would be named? 




 *Highfives* while I love good reverse basses I've always been more of a [gated kick](http://youtu.be/YIrSN0UbgXg) guy 




 This the most unnecessary necessary thing. You will be remembered for this  




 I just googled "Jojo pose" but holy shit why isn't their any Jojo/WWE crossover art!? They would fit together so well 




 [*deep breath*........ AVANT GARD!!!!!!](http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/187968/2684413-1379684728-d4-screenshot-2.jpg) 









 Holy shit I died when he said chimichangas to go  




 and after we finish those delicious sandwiches lets go visit Leon's brother who lives in the cop car in raccoon city  




 I know what you mean, let's go out and get some Jill sandwiches  









 [Fuck the vita!](http://andriasang.com/comp76/my_sister_cute_and_popular/22mbf.jpg) I got a god damn cake DS 




 Ultrapancake I'm still waiting on that liam and woolie version of my neighbor totoro 

()  









 Passenger of shit will always be a weird entity. He has the ability and talent to make good music, but he just doesn't. As evidenced by his song [when the heart fails](http://youtu.be/bmU9tUZvk98), all of his stuff is the musical equivalent of masterbating with steal wool then shoving a jaged peice of metal up your dick  




 /b/ would go back and make "staple tapeworms to my penis" the world anthem  




 Delete did a great job with the samples in this 









 *pats on back, hands nuka-cola and psycho* "kick up your feet, uncap that bottle and dose up. We all make mistakes out here" 




 I really love the Therabyte voice. "Therabyte, we don't bite... hard *rawr*" R.I.P Therabyte :( /u/DjThera I'm interesed to know why Therabyte shut down. It had some good releases under its belt (Ironically Unknown 3) 




 A kick edit of stamp on the ground by the italo brothers (good song but in think it would sound great with a harder kick) 









 I can feel pats searing rage from here 




 LIAM LEAVES THE VENTS TO JOIN THE BRAWL! 




 Mines infernal imp, originally I was going to be blue sun but that was already taken and I didn't want to be blue sun_22 so I chose a phrase that was kicking around in my head, and that phrase happened to be infernal imp. I'm thinking of making another alias for speedcore and beyond called goreboy but I don't know if I will  




 [She sure is](http://villains.wikia.com/wiki/Sakuya_Izayoi?file=0cc71930fa6b2c7a02cfdc9560885e51.jpg)

EDIT: Should be all good now! 




 [no but shut up though](http://www.gamekyo.com/images_1/dc1911acd82cec0147111f1bd0ea6afd20110627173443.png) 




 Oh ya, I totally forgot about the touhou fighters  




 I mean lolis shooting at eachother, also damn good music 









 I know I want to do somthing music related and I want to learn about mastering and mixing and from what everyone is saying I wont learn about that in collage 




 Ok, I am a junior in high school who is looking to become an audio engineer and reading this freaked me out :(. What I'm getting from this is I should look for an internship and find a place that has a good engineering program?  




 For sure! 




 I played Jojo allstars battle royal yesterday! It was ok :( the movement felt bad but it looked fantastic and they got all the little details right, it sucks because Jojo is a great concept for a fighting game 




 Two degs  




 Sweet I'm all for story telling... I'll check some of those out 




 It had a lot of things that turn me off anime *cough cough* INSEST *cough cough*... But seriously one of the main things I didn't like was the tone it was just inconsistent, it goes from goofy cat girl bullshit to horrible multination with no middle ground. The part that killed it for me was was the fight scene between Lucy and that other girl they both looked ridiculous which made it even more stupid when she says "my vector has a better range then yours" which I guess sums it up right their. TO MANY FUCKING CLICHS lets see: goofy sex stuff where another character walks in on them *check* Incest *check* taking a girl home with you who you just found at the beach with no clothing on instead of taking her to the hospital *check* building up a harem *check* having one of those scenes where two characters are comparing their powers in the middle of a fight *check* naked underage girls *check*  just too many clichs  presented with a completely straight face which makes the violence hard to take seriously (it is pretty raw I will say that though) also this is kind of a minor gripe but fucking cat girls with invisible hands coming out of their backs that are basically high frequency blades...... I mean really. It's late here.... So ya fuck you elfen lied 




 I fucking love Jojo so much. It has shown me that I can love anime! It also got some bad tastes out of my mouth (fuck you elfen lied)

P.S. I can explain why I don't like elfen lied if you want me to 




 Metroid metal.... Woa man 




 I mean you could post that, it sounds super awesome! But what I'm looking for is stuff that samples the ziabatzu, like taking little audio clips of them and putting it into a song, also covers of the theme. You know things like that :)  




 I like to believe that shaq's head is filled with marshmallows and chocolate, he is truly a national treasure...   




 Silent hills..... =( oh please I want to see the town in my dreams  




 Post music that is a remix, mash-up, cover of anything zaibatsu related! We've been getting some good music lately [I'll go first with somthing I made](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/ginger-breaks-wip)

P.S. I'll try to finish this sometime, although it's going to be be a little tricky since I lost the project file :/ 









 Lets see.... /u/trollabot audiofrq  




 Exilent (   ) 









 Holy shit 100 comments per month!? I was expecting less 

Also Hardcore is one of my most used words.... Perfect  




 /u/trollabot test_subject8320

Let's see what we get... 




 I'm working on a very super secret special project and I need some liam vocal clips, the first one shouldn't be super hard to find just him talking about Japan, the next one might be a little more difficult I just need a clip of him saying "rain" bonus points for anyone who can find me a clip of him saying "tea". Post links and time stamps I can rip the audio my self :) thanks in advance! 




 [Like this? :D](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/ginger-breaks-wip) also yes this is by me 




 Maybe throw up a spoiler for that pic dude 




 Hey Darude! What do you think about hard trance? More importantly have you ever thought about making it? 




 I've seen Thera comment at points, same with Atmozfears  




 Angerfist = Floorcrushers (only did one song though)

Thera used to do Hard trance 

You know what, how about we all list artists with other aliases just so we know! 

Audiofreq = ~~BL1K~~ BRK3, Bioweapon, Orbit1

Activator = ACTI

Geck-o = Geck-e

Shingo Dj = NATP, Round Wave Crusher

Zatox and tatanka = Wild Motherfuckerz

DJ Hidden and Eye-D = The Outside Agency 

Christan from Art Of Fighters is part of Meccano Twins






 




 You could try some good ol' fashion crossbreed. The Outside Agency and Meander (Ophidian's crossbreed alias) are two of my personal favorites, as for hardcore to hardstyle a lot of Endymion's tracks bridge that certain gap. I would recommend their track Mirror Mirror with Alpha2 (it is rawstyle though) 




 Now that is a movie I would watch! Coming this summer... David Hayter is Big Dog 




 "This is dog"

*David hayter grunt/startled noise.wav* 




 Up top to the pasty white dude bit brother! Hopefully we'll see some lesser known genres gain fans in the near future (hard trance 3) 




 This kind of bell/chime sound [it starts right at the beginning](http://youtu.be/mSulcjw9OOM) it's from the song rock that beat by the Highstreet Allstars  




 I understand were you coming from man I'm the same way when it comes to anime, I've never really liked the whole harem story trope. On a diffrent note check out "Jojo's bizarre adventure" it is one of the HYPEST animes out their! I'm talking guys with the mussle mass of bulls punching each other and fighting vampires. Plus the main villain Dio is one of the best villains out their, he is an asshole and he knows it, and at times you will laugh along with him because he's just so evil. Also any time any of the voice actors have to say an english word it is pure gold 




 Yep the one at the beginning  




 Sakura is fantastic for Asian strings 




 Val-Kilmer sounds really good, the synth is nice and the melody is catchy. For sure look into side chaining, it will make everything cleaner  




 The way the melody came in was a little sloppy, otherwise good job the actual melody was catchy and the kicks cut through everything nicely  




 His mix tape is hotter then 10 nukes 




 We should give this guy a name! Any ideas? 




 Thank you mods! Also can we have a button that plays a woolie sound clip every time it's pushed, if that's to much to ask for I understand :) 




 oooohhh, some of those sounded pretty good, thanks for this bra 




 Dude stop.... The vice can only get so tight  




 One of the best sample library peices of advice came from /u/noisestorm on Twitter (or reddit I don't remember) basically he made a folder of all the samples he made and some of his favorites from sample packs and deleted the ones he never used 




 When I get my computer back I am going to buy Sakura and I will send you the stems/FLP (if you got FL) and we will work on this togeather because I don't know a lot about trap! 




 Good sound design, especially that part around 0:13-0:14 it sounds really sharp. Make this into a full song please... Also maybe use a diffrent text to speech software, I've personally never liked the ones that come with FL, they sound kind of weak (Just my opinion! If you like them then don't let me get in your way) 




 *Tightens vice* 




 Thank you! I never considered taking it in a trap direction, maybe I could start it off as a traditional japanese song and then slowly introduce trap elements... Shit man I picked the worst week to send my computer in () 




 Man SWERY should do an AMA on here, I think out of every lets play fan base we love him the most 




 Wait, this is by the guys who made jet set?!? (I feel dumb for not knowing that) also yep, going to have to put a vice on my nuts/wallet until I hear how it is 




 I've seen these drums before but I never knew what they were called, thanks a lot dude! The drums could be used for "the coming of the storm" part 




 I've never really given them a good in depth listen, when my computer gets back from the shop I'll have to give them a better listen 




 Yep, FL user! I have nothing against the FPC drums, I was just wondering of any other sample packs  




 I'm working on a song and I'm trying trying to tell the story of someone walking down a rainy street and going into a tea shop to warm up, I have the strings and rain now I need some percussion (mainly a good woodblock sound!) free or paid it doesn't matter, thanks in advance you beautiful people! 3 




 I understand what your saying dude, hmm it feels like I've had this issue with a vst before, maybe put a little more space in between the notes? (Sorry if I'm not super helpful my computer's at the shop so I can't really do any thing music related) 




 Digging the art style, reminds me a bit of king city, post what you think about it here! I'm always a little cautious with early access games 

Also for those who don't know! King city is a great comic that I stumbled across in a book store, I don't think the ~~ziabatzu~~ zaibatsu have ever talked about it but it seems like somthing they would really like, check it out if you ever come across it 




 So basically what your saying is sony is a giant tentacle monster?  




 Yep, I need a PC port of this, I am convinced I will like this a lot more then dark souls  




 Sytrus has a bunch of cool ones (especially the pads) I'll list afew vst's 

Sakura: sitar 1 (I love Asian strings!)

Harmor: I'm spacing on its name it sounds like some kind of synth that you would hear in a movie like blade runner

Toxic Biohazard: The underwater preset is pretty cool and dreamy

Serum: Any of art of fighters presets (he did a good job on them)


 




 sakura can recreate this (I'm pretty sure), it's great for oriental stuff and it might have a erhu preset (I don't know for sure because I've never taken a good look at the presets :P) 




 Definitely add some reverb to the harpsichord at the beginning, it will give it a better presence, otherwise no real glaring issues with this, keep it up I'm interested to hear what else you can do :)   




 Nice job on the strings dude! The intro sounds great and it flows very nicely into the drop, keep your head up man you did good on this :) 




 In most songs that sample video games, the sample is used once and it comes across as lame and not using the clip to its fullest potential, this on the other hand uses the sample fantastically! Checkout Geck-o (his other alias) if you want to hear more from this guy (sadly this is the only fallout song he's done) 









 https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/rainy-day-in-the-east I'm thinking of turning this into a full song, but im stumped on what kind of percussion would go well with this. Also I'm not super happy with the melody it sounds inconsistent and the progression sounds off (just listen and you'll understand), thanks in advance for the help :)

 Looking to get into hard house, I've really been liking it lately, also thank you to everyone! I asked about hard trance awhile ago and got a ton of responses. 




 Wow... This was Russian, the kick was a little quiet 




 ;_; "im hunkered down in this cave for the night, seems pretty standard as far as caves go, although I am hearing some strange noises coming from deeper in the cave, it sounds like a combination of buzzing and growling. I'm going to go check it out, it's probably just a bloatfly and a couple of coyotes," -Some dead Motherfucker (R.I.P) 




 I feel bad for laughing as hard as I did  




 The switches remind me of something you would see on a virtual synthesizer, like the virus swich or the dog meat knob  














 Yeeeeeeeeeeeahhhhh!!!!! (Pat or the csi voice you decide) 




 BURN THE HERETICS ON A HOT GRAPHICS CARD!!  




 This is so 80's that it hurts good find though  




 This might not be the place to post this, post this on one of the feedback threads or wait until we have another plug DJ night :) 




 I made [this big 'ol mess](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/fx-kick-reese) out of one from the blutonium hardstyle pack, also serum fucking rocks!   




 I would love to talk with him sometime, just get in his head and learn where he got some of the ideas for some of the more memorable platinum game set pieces  









 YES!!! /u/mike0dude please 




 thank you.... thank you so much! now all we need is for the mods to put this on the sub  









 Wow that doll is super sexy/hot/cute also holy shit I have never heard woolie make a noise like that, I really do hope this gets ported to PC 




 It's so cute 









 I messaged audiofreq and he sent me the radio edit and DJ edit, I should still go to iTunes for Hoo-ey  




 For sure checkout the JSHC, also checkout psycho filth records for aggressive stuff, if your looking for happier music checkout [Foryousounds](http://www.foryousounds.com) all anime remixes, completely free! Theirs also mob squad Tokyo and massive criclez. WORD OF WARNING!!! At points you will have to resort to torrenting, I beleve that you should support the artist when ever possible but some times theirs no other way! I'll PM you a link to were I get most of my japanese stuff 




 Aggred, good songs that are sadly broken and mislabeled, plus I'm still pretty salty about Hoo-ey :/. Also on the 2013 hardcore comp. a good chunk of the tracks were from the FREE "this is hardcore" album 




 This too  




 If you want a good titanic sci-fi thing watch that one episode of futerama  




 If you like hardcore checkout the Japanese stream hardcore compilations  




 *pats on back* 




 How will I remember to use the code ~~WoolirM~~ WoolieM now?! (fuck phone keyboards) 




 "I hear the guy from your yug-ge-oh? Is in it" 




 very nice dude! heres a patch I made a while ago (its not as good as yours but still) https://www.dropbox.com/s/06qhr8ecvzixmp9/dreamy%20pluck.fst?dl=0 




 Yep, I might be wrong here but our boi woolie woolz used to do a little bit of modeling  




 But it will only be painless if we 
(Don't forget to use the code WoolieM) 




 I still need to check out the tidy shop so if it's not their I'll try out the torrent when I get home 




 Theirs no option to buy it :/ 




 Back in 2006 tidy trax released "Dark by design - The producer series //01" it was a limited edition CD that has long since sold out. So my question is where do I start if I want to find it/who should I ask? I know this is kind of a stupid question but I appreciate any help :) 




 God dammit heady :( 









 Do you need help getting out? 




 Woa! Thanks man, I'll look through all of these carefully :D 














 Usually I buy the comps. From cloud 9 but recently I bought the 2014 one and it's safe to say I'm done buying from them :/  









 #it's not Phil's fault, blame his parents  









 Holy shit that hank hill one, their were a ton of good ones in this  




 Yo super serious question for you shitlords, would I like this game? I played about 50 hrs of darksouls and I was only able to ring the two bells  dark souls was pretty fun but it felt like their were too many instances of banging my head agents a wall, also I didn't really like the art style of DS, this on the other hand looks pretty cool  









 Sure thing dude! Expect to see more on here later today 




 Alek Szahala, he's a Finish freeform producer, a lot of his songs are acid influenced, I would recommend his song Darkstar  




 My boy from Finland! I love him so much, back when I was into dubstep he was on the top of my list! 




 It sucks that a lot of HT artists are going subground. I love subground but I love HT more 









 Yo could I get a episode number and time stamp on pats indigo prophecy thing, mental disabilities kind of resonate with me because one of my family members is mentally disabled  




 *Sigh* oh the ziabatzu let me count the ways I love thee, 1. You always make me laugh, 2. You make me love things (I am now a mgs fan because of you chuckle fucks) 3. I started liking anime more 4. I realized the glory of Japan because of you and 5. You have gotten funnier over the years. Now what I would do if I ever met you, Matt: I would watch a action movie with you and your wife and then look at your action figures with intent and ask you questions about each one, Pat: I would talk horror and computers with you until the sun goes down then comes up again, Woolie: I would have you guide my hips and teach me all about fighting games I would also buy you a new mic because seriously dude and Liam: I would watch anime with you and after we finish watching you could tell me about how great the vita is and I would then go out and buy one. Also being super serious /u/mike0dude should be in a video or be on the podcast he is the true MVP of this sub, Mike keep up the good work you beautiful SOB 




 HFS MAN! Thank you, looks like I've got a lot of listening to do 




 Thank you! Got anymore for me? 









 Hello /r/Trance! As the title says, give me some suggestions! I am open to anyone/any kind of trance. Also let me tell you what I listen to normally, I love the harder side of music so hardcore, hardstyle, hard trance things like that I've also noticed that I love music from 2009 (those old hardstyle melodies are one of the things I live for) thank you in advance :) 




 What would be the team names? The space chodes vs the woolie boys? 









 Resubmiting because this got taken due to mod suppression /s (I broke rule 2) 
I'm betting that a lot of you have seen this video but it hasn't been posted here before so I figured why not :), the editing in this video is really good and with out sounding like a Canadian maple tree, it makes me proud to be part of this scene
