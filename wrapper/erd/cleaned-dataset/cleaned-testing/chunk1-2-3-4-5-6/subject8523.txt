 Hey Ross, 
First up, you're my fav with all the delicious puns and such,
and if you had to stick playing one video game for the rest of your life,
What game would that be? 









 My best guess would be a sever migraine, They have many ways to suppress them if they become more frequent, but usualy a acute migrane (as you described) can take over your whole day, feel better buddy 
 
























 Wait closer to the date, you don't want to organise a date based meeting and have alot of time inbetween, 2 nights max  




 Well not really, she is a very smart, kind, quite science/law uni student, and too be honest very new too dating, she has never had a boyfriend isint one too hook up at clubs virgin but still she is a lovely lady.

I on the other hand am your common no uni get straight into work whatever go's kind of guy, I met her at a party last week we've been talking ever since, we really get along.

And so I asked her out on a date (in 2 days) we are going to go to this local trendy bar, she has never been there and I use too work there, so knowing everyone there will make me look more like a badass, 
I plan to take her to the beach after that and be all romantic look at the stars but I don't know if I should kiss her or invite her back to my house compliment her buy her a flower pick her up or meet her there, usually I don't date really nice girls like this and I really want to give this one hell of a go, any advice guys?

 In comparison to her I'm a rebel without a cause  




 I don't think she is a big drinker, as I mentioned she is a very placid lady I guess you could say, 
























 I've actually noticed that aswell, my phone takes amazing photos, it is defiantly in the top 2 phones for image quality, yet my friends with i phone 5's get nice insta photos, when you think about it, it's kinda prejudice   




 Today I noticed on my task bar a strange program opening and closing in a split second, I was quite concerned of what it was, I have never seen this before, I tried grabbing a screenshot of the logo that was being displayed on the taskbar http://imgur.com/KlHmE2o  
  
I also tried clicking on the program to see if any window came up, luckily one did, I managed too get a half assed screen shot of the message, slightly translucent, but readable  http://imgur.com/f1CuXkw  
  
Any help would be so awesome guys 




 Can't you just place your stun to anti engage?
