 Seemed like an awful lot of detail in that article for it not to have been tried yet - discussion and questions by the girls during questioning? I am not sure I've ever seen that before.

 The average Midwest redneck does, too.  




 I've long pondered whether those folks really exist in the wild, or if they're simply the paid talking heads who mock responsible, Eco-conservative people as minions of their corporate masters (oil/ coal/fracking). It's fairly obvious they are; these are the same character-lacking folks who, for a paycheck, would've sold out their brother-in-law to the SS. Or done any dirty work for any dirty master. They're terrorists when you consider that their "side" is pro-pollution and anti-environment. They are the enemy of humanity.  




 No. The folks who do that are the dregs of society. Historically speaking they're nothing. Their paycheck today only shows they're successful whores. Not successes.

 Absurd. It's not unpopular. It's wrong. Look at Australia. They had a mass shooting. They altered gun regulations. They stopped any future massacres. We've lost thousands this year alone in America to gun terrorism.  




 That and a registration and regulated gun ownership. When someone is known to be disturbed and dangerous, he should not be able to legally buy firearms and ammo.  




 No, it doesn't matter if we know the name of the shooter. What matters is that he was known to be totally unbalanced and disturbed, yet was able to legally buy a fuckload of guns and ammo, and then keep those even when cops checked on him after tips that he was going to go off. What the actual fuck? Stop letting crazy people buy and own guns. Period.  




 Right?? Had the cops been able to reference registered weapons, they'd have been able to seize them once the credible threat of violence had been reported to them. Instead they talked to the psycho and walked away, making it possible for him to assassinate innocent Americans. If we simply had registration similar to vehicle ownership requires, this would enable law enforcement to act appropriately and remove the weapons from the crazy fucks who post threats.  




 The cops were at a house. He'd been reported as a serious threat. Had we some way to regulate gun ownership like car ownership, those cops would have known he had a fuckload of guns and ammo in the house when they visited. The fact that this isn't the number one issue discussed after this gun terrorism is another bit if proof as to how powerful the weapons dealing NRA is.  




 What are you on about? The progressives I am familiar with are typically a-theistic and see misogyny where it exists.  




 It's not the fact that someone voting GOP would not like Obama, it's that by supporting the GOP, they are supporting misogyny, racist policies and bigoted, homophobic policies.  




 I'm a progressive and I don't think people should accept the over-simplified and incorrect notion that criticizing a culture = racism. Oppression of women is a problem around the globe. Noting it does not make someone a racist. That's a red herring thrown out by actual racists!  




 Incredibly disheartening. I'm afraid our racist bigots in the US will find allies in these euro nuts.  




 Not OP but guessing he was relating to the "I'm against the government I now serve within" sentiment. We have many far-right in the US who continually talk shit about government in general, the federal govt in specific, and then run for office within that very government. And then attempt to destroy it as we see with the GOP and the baggers.  




 In the US we are currently fucked, absolutely fucked, by the far-right so-called-small-government fuckers who are simply whores to lobbyists and corporations. They tell their followers that they are against the federal government, then they do everything they can to help big corporations and fuck over ordinary citizens. The two-face nature is dangerous, as are those who believe it.  




 It's very disheartening. As an American I incorrectly grant Europe an idealized identity of progressive and intellectual greatness. While it does exist, they have the same religious / racist / bigots we do.  




 Election turnouts in the US are horrible as well, letting the bigots and racists win here as well. Until people are compelled to vote like in Australia or simply become more responsible and do their citizen duty, I'm not sure how it will get better.  




 Is there some resurgence if the kkk lately or wtf?

 Sick shit. Hope he gets no votes.  




 Of course, this is all too familiar: a young aggrieved male, mentally disturbed, threatening othersespecially womenbut still able to get his hands on a high-capacity magazine of the variety used in so many other mass murders. This doesn't happen in any other high income country with the regularity it does here; in fact, it almost never happens in any of them.

But here, in the good ole US of A, weve allowed a group of rich, entitled thugs who run an operation fronting for arms dealersguys who represent a minority position on pretty much every issue having to do with reasonable regulation of firearms even among gun ownersto dictate our policies to cowardly, careerist politicians.

Bingo.  




 I'm curious why you think so.  




 There are people whose lives have been beyond devastated, chain reaction fucked up, by the actions of bank fraudsters. It's not surprising people would be this angry. I don't condone the violent approach but I get why someone would.  




 That's totally my counter top.  




 It really sounded like he should have been considered an immediate threat to those around him. Would that plus the warnings from his family to the sheriff Not warrant a search and seizure of weapons / loss of the right to have one? 




 Quote 6 is a huge deal. Why wasn't he searched for weapons if this was a known concern?? 




 Both kids were wealthy, clinically diagnosed to be disturbed, and able to acquire firearms. That's the one link we could break as a society. Stop crazy folks from owning and acquiring firearms. We must.  




 Where'd he get the gun??? 




 But they don't have the UsA's Lucy goosey lack of gun regulation.  




 Think harder. It's the fact that the NRA and congress repeatedly block laws that would keep firearms away from people proven to be emotionally disturbed like this fucker.  




 No, it's the sanest thing he could say. To blame a gun, maybe a stretch. But the reason that certifiable nutters like the shooter can GET guns is the NRA and their beholden in congress. Just fucking make people prove they are not crazy before buying lethal weapons. What is so fucking hard about that concept? Yet the NRA blocks research, encourages insane responses from the fringes of their already-radical members, and fans the flames of these mass shootings. Fuck. How can anyone see this suffering beautiful father, his life FUCKING RUINED by a proven-crazy fucker who's family contacted the sheriff for fucks sake, and who was still, still able to procure a gun!- and argue against blocking crazy folks from buying and owning firearms?

 I remember the anti-poverty campaigns of the 70's and early 80's. And it seems our poverty problem is much worse this time around - it's going to take a massive shift in the perception of public opinion. But I'd argue the true public opinion is to help thy neighbor. It's just when people are manipulated into thinking that fixing the poverty problem is somehow giving people a free lotto ticket. It's just a fucked marketing campaign of the Paul Ryan austerity types, sitting pretty and calling out hate speech against the worst-off among us.

 There should be a number similar to 911 that people could forward threatening texts to in the case that they know the aggressor is armed, or potentially armed. Something that could immediately send out an emergency alert like an Amber Alert to the area. (A Red Alert?) 



















 As we saw in the Santa Barbara massacre, the parents tried to warn cops but they needed access to his home. Now, a law is being passed so that concern IS the justifiable cause. This may help. 

I always hear that people don't want laws because law abiding citizens follow them and criminals don't. However, if we make selling a handgun without a background check illegal, all that does is put the good guys on notice to run background checks to ensure they aren't selling to a bad guy - which happens! Felons buy guns without background checks right now. One way or another we need that to end. If a GGWAG is selling in a private transaction and runs a background check and the buyer is a felon, the GGWAG has just potentially saved lives. I'll never get why someone who is supposedly a good guy gun owner would be against that.  



















 Background checks aren't required on all gun sales. It's one of the big issues for gun safety advocates right now.  




 It's come out that the majority of mass shootings have been done by people who have illegally obtained guns. It seems to ME that anyone pro-gun with half a brain would agree that background checks and registration would make their own gun ownership safer and more protected, because it could stop many of these massacres that make so many people afraid of gun owners. What's your take on this? Why not require background checks and registration of every firearm?

 As part of their investigation, police will try to trace the gun using an existing serial number, Friedman noted, but the most likely explanation for Zehaf Bibeaus possession of the gun is that he purchased it on the black market or stole it from its original owner. If its the latter, the legal owner could face charges if he or she knew the gun had been taken and failed to report it to police. 









 Similarly we need a discussion about access to firearms without people immediately shutting down their brains decrying "personal freedom infringement". If someone has their passport taken away, and then voila has a firearm and bullets, the FIRST QUESTION should be how? Where did he get them?

 Much of America agrees with you. However we have a broken electoral system and a gridlocked system of center-right democrats and fourth-reich republicans. The NRA owns the republicans and many of the democrats too; the fact that we allow unregulated and unreported and virtually unrestricted financial lobbying and donating to the electoral system by groups like the NRA means that our votes, our letters, our protests are being virtually ignored. Follow groups like 

http://momsdemandaction.org/

http://www.bradycampaign.org/

http://www.parentsagainstgunviolence.com/

and many more to see how many Americans are truly working to change this. I'm sure our country looks crazy as fuck from the outside but many of us just want to know we can send our children to kindergarten and get them back alive with no bullet holes. And personally as a mom, I don't feel that way at ALL. My own parents are older and they discuss our entire family leaving the US. It's absurd.  




 And yet everything they are saying about this family in articles is that they are a "gun family" - shooting ranges, guns with them on every outing. Scary to think these *are* experienced gun folks. They're just so comfortable with the weapons that they have a false sense of safety. It's like carrying a vial of ebola virus around. Ticking time bomb that could kill any of us.  




 Fairly sure the three older siblings who witnessed it will end up cluing him in. All four kids witnessed the shooting. From the articles I've read it sounds like there are guns everywhere in this family. Hoping law enforcement at the very least removes the guns from the home, since they clearly put the children at risk.  




 It's abhorrent. As a parent in the US, I am uncomfortable sending my child anywhere without a drastic change to our lack of gun regulation. We lose an average of 82 citizens a day to gun violence. 

[Each year, more than 30,000 Americans die in gun suicides, homicides, and unintentional shootings as a result of the ready availability, and accessibility, of specific classes of firearms. Gun violence is more than a crime issue; it is a broad-based public health crisis of which crime is merely the most recognized aspect.](http://www.vpc.org/aboutvpc.htm)

 Grounsell said there will be no charges in the accidental shooting.

**"accidental"**

We fail these dead children every time we don't charge a parent.  














 Vetri Ferman said the victims were Nicole Hill, Stone's ex-wife; Patricia Flick, Hill's sister; Flick's husband, Aaron; the Flicks' 14-year-old daughter, and Hill's mother and grandmother.

...

Another neighbor, Ashley Deane, heard the same noises, likening them to a car or truck hitting a house.

She said she heard what sounded like four gunshots and could hear children screaming for their mother.

Deane said she could hear Stone telling the children that they had to leave. She said she looked out the front window and could see him with the children, who were in their pajamas.

Deane said Stone looked at her and said, "She's hurt," referring to his ex-wife. Stone and the children got in a car and sped off.

This kind of shit should not be happening to children. 
From another article, 
["They've been fighting for years, real bad," a neighbor, Michele Brewster, told the Allentown Morning Call. "He's been tormenting her. She's gone to the police, and she has told everybody, 'He's going to kill me.'''](http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-pennsylvania-manhunt-20141216-story.html)

It will be interesting to see the fallout from this case, to learn how someone with a record of threatening to kill his ex-wife and mother of his daughters was able to access a firearm. Accountability.  









 Exactly. No charges filed, most likely. And often, no guns removed from the home! Fucking absurd. KKK/NRA

 **Between January 2009 and July 2014, there were at least 110 mass shootings in the U.S. Not all of them make headlinesand the story the data tells is different from the one that mass media would have you expect.**

Using FBI data and media reports, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of every identifiable mass shooting between January 2009 - July 2014. There were at least 110 mass shootings.

**The Washington gun lobby claims that areas where gun-carrying is restricted - gun-free zones - cause mass violence rather than reduce it.**

Our analysis show this is not the case: an overwhelming majority of mass shootings take place in private homes where gun carrying is unrestricted, and less than one in six incidents took place in a so-called gun-free zone.

**Perpetrators of mass shootings are not the people you expect.**
The press often focuses on the mental health of the shooters, but our analysis shows that only 10% of perpetrators exhibited signs of mental illness that were reported to a doctor or other authority figure prior to the incident.

**Perpetrators of mass shootings are generally older than perpetrators of gun violence in the U.S. as a whole.**

Whereas FBI data shows that the median age of gun murderers in the U.S. is 26, the median age of perpetrators of mass shootings was 34.

**Domestic violence is a factor in the majority of mass shootings.**

In 57% of incidents, the shooter killed a current or former partner or family member.

**51% of mass shooting victims are women.**

In contrast to gun violence generally, perpetrators of mass shootings disproportionately target women. Whereas only 15% of total gun homicide victims are women, 51% of mass shooting victims are women.

**High-capacity magazines put the mass in mass shooting.**

When perpetrators used high-capacity magazines or assault weapons likely equipped with them, they shot 159% more people resulting in 65% more deaths.
 



















 An analysis of mass shootings, defined as those in which at least four people were killed with a gun, conducted from January 2009 to July 2014 by the gun-control group Everytown for Gun Safety found that of 110 mass shootings, at least 63 of the cases, 57 percent, were related to family or domestic violence. In at least 20 incidents, the shooter had a prior domestic violence charge.

Dee Price Childers, a volunteer with the West Virginia Chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, a division of Everytown for Gun Safety, released a statement on the Monongalia shootings. Our hearts go out to the families of the victims of yesterdays mass shooting in Monongalia County, she said.

This terrible tragedy is yet another reminder of just how easy it is for convicted felons to get their hands on deadly weapons thanks to background check loopholes in federal and state law  and just how often domestic violence turns into deadly gun violence.

 



















 The condo is owned by 46-year-old Jon Holzwarth. An internet search revealed he is in the internet security and firearms businesses.

No one answered at Holzwarth's door where a sign reads: "We don't dial 9-1-1" with a metal cutout of a pistol dangling below.

There were also emblems about guns on his Jeep.  














 * Recognizing the role that assault weapons and high capacity ammunition magazines played, the authors said Lanza's easy access to them "cannot be ignored as a critical factor in this tragedy." The ready availability of assault weapons in the U.S. is an important public health issue, they said.
* Lanza's "severe and deteriorating internalized mental health problems" were combined with a preoccupation with violence. With access to deadly weapons, this "proved a recipe for mass murder," the report concludes.
* The report questions whether Lanza's race and privileged socio-economic status impacted how he was treated. "Is the community more reluctant to intervene and more likely to provide deference to the parental judgment and decision-making of white, affluent parents than those caregivers who are poor or minority?" the report asks.
 









 I'll go with the right to live and be educated over the right to kill. Every. Fucking. Day.
The NRA is public enemy number 1.  



















 Ugh. RIP to your brother. 3 




 Oh man. That's the best - so hilarious!!! Eldest here, so I've been on the other end of a ruse or deuce.  




 Having done a few winters in North Dakota and a few 113 summers, I'll say you get used to it, whatever "it" is.  




 Man, people want a full on graphically designed explanation nowadays. Nicely edited2 




 Abusive but successful personal trainer 




 Sorry, that's shitty And sad.  




 Oh fuck! 




 YES. what the fuck are we doing accepting this shit? If the GOP is going to get off their asses and do Anything now that they snorted enough Koch to be in power, they can start by putting the profiteers in prison and handing back all that fat cash to the folks screwed by the thievery.  




 If Jaime Dimon doesn't get prison, we haven't seen Justice.  




 Everybody remembers how Occupy were a bunch of fuckups though! Media matters, and people ARE sheeple. Just sayin.  




 Rubbish.  




 :True 




 Could be anything from a prank to attempted murder.  




 Why can't that fucker fall off a cliff? Ted Cruz is beyond douchebag.  




 Absolutely. Let's support Obama's call for this. This is our internet, and once they make it a tiered corporate system, it will never go back. Preserve net neutrality now, or never.  




 Obviously those shot should have defended themselves with AKs - unless the Toddlers had AKs, in which case nuclear weapons are acceptable.  









 Wealth Hoarding Never Works.  




 out in the slammer

* for whites:  probation / fines / *maybe* jail

* everyone else: jail / beatings / *maybe* shot in the back 




 Do gilded fences burn, per se? 




 Ah, an everlasting GOPstopper! 





























 I heard the gun go off and saw his middle finger hanging by a string, she said.

Canseco shot his middle finger on his left hand.


It will either have to be amputated or have full reconstruction surgery," Knight said.

Doctors already told the couple Canseco will never have full use of his hand again, Knight said.  





































































 Next mail to the Ayatollah will probably be bibles and Walmart gift cards.  














 Yeah, this really just requires a collective "WELL DUH, VLAD"

In a few more months we'll see a headline saying that he shot that dude in the back, right?  




 One of the good guys. This stuff is not new; my grandfather was an OB/GYN and used to travel to indian reservations to delivery babies. There have always been people who are NOT bigots, not racists. The line we are fed about the times changing...really what's changing is whether we accept that status quo or challenge it en masse.  









 It's a gun thing, not a pot thing. Take the pot away, and the gun could still kill ya.  



























































 This is the third incident involving children and guns since Friday in the Houston area.
 









 ^^ End of story.  









 Just local NRA chapter head.  




 A man who declined to be identified told a Reuters photographer that a teenaged girl in a nightgown came to his house, running barefoot through a snowy wooded area and crying that her parents had been shot. They called police and law enforcement officials found her parents dead at their home.

Authorities said they later discovered five other people dead and a wounded woman in three other houses. The woman, who is expected to recover, gave them information about the shooter, Texas County Sheriff James Sigman said.

Four of the victims were identified as Garold Aldridge, 52, his wife Julie Aldridge, 47, Harold Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Aldridge, 48.

Authorities would not identify the other victims, but the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that they were Carey Shriver and his wife Valirea Shriver, and Carey's father Darrell Shriver. Darrell's wife Martha was wounded but survived, the paper said. 














 Kyle T. Dodds was treated for a gunshot wound at the Nebraska Medical Center and booked into the Sarpy County Jail for attempted first-degree assault, making terroristic threats, felony child abuse and use of a weapon to commit a felony.
Just before midnight Bellevue police were called to 4128 Bartmann Dr. and learned that Dodds was intoxicated and armed with a rifle. Also inside the home were a woman and two young children, said Officer Laurie Synowiecki, a Bellevue police spokeswoman. 
























 Blame the unnamed contractor. Contractors are the new interns.  














 Her Facebook page is filled with Bible verses, and information about organizing for the Republican Party.  



















 Oddly similar to how the  GOP caters to billionaires but keeps its own supporters half-witted and clueless.  




 So no cell phones, but ISIS can tweet and create video montages of massacres? These fuckers flip flop like politicians.  







































 Yep. Looks like the news will either blame atheism or progressivism, and not the gun that killed the three. No fucking surprise.  









 "My sister had a right to life," said Jane Dougherty of Littleton, whose sibling was killed at Sandy Hook. "My sister had a right to grow old. ... Nobody ever died from a background check." 














 That picture reads like something out of a trailer park or an open carry Texas rally. Teabillies are the same all over the world!  







































 It's a weird thing to feel awkward about though - it's the RIGHT thing to do, even though it's easily mocked and scoffed at. What's better - giving out money? Giving out fast food? Or giving out healthy food?  




 This divide-and-conquer could result in deaths. Rand Paul should step down. This is very dangerous misinformation that puts the public at dire risk.  




 This is incredibly dangerous, and he should be forced to resign. Unfit to serve if he can't grasp basic science. This is seriously KILLING PEOPLE; I have a tiny niece who is too young to have received the measles vax. And pregnant friends; anyone know what happens to a fetus if mom gets rubella? FUCK THIS SHIT. Rand Paul is a fucking ignorant info-terrorist and should not hold any public office.  




 Holy shit. he should step down; that shows a profound lack of understanding of basic science. UNFIT TO SERVE.  












































 Coloradans bought 36,666 guns last month, according to the states background check report. 


Horror.  









 Worried that the fighting might escalate further and knowing that guns and ammunition were around the house, the 14-year-old started gathering what she could find to hide it.

"(The girl) said all the guns were in easily accessible places," the complaint said. "(She) said that, fearing one of her parents would pick up a gun and use it against the other, she tried to grab all the guns and ammunition. (She) said she put the guns/ammunition she could gather into her bedroom, to get them away from her parents."

Police searched the home and found five guns that belonged to Wright, according to the complaint. A Mossberg 500 12-gauge shotgun and a Smith   Wesson AR 5 rifle were in a child's room. 
 



















 To be fair, that was some sweet honeyed dick.  




 Same-same. But different.  




 Same here. I thought of my own child when he accidentally spills something and says "Sorry mom, I spilled my drink"...and how this kid said "I'm sorry, Mom. I shot Corbin." 

The adults surrounding those two boys failed them both. I hope the five year old gets massive support and counseling, but I fear that's not something you ever get over. God damnit.  









 I see stories like this daily, but this one wrecks me. Where is the nationwide PSA? Where are the safe storage laws being demanded by the survivors?? Where is the accountability here? This five year old's life is forever damaged.  















































































 Well, as someone with a kid, I cannot blame them. I wonder - how would you handle it if your kid was walking from a convenient store and ended up shot dead, and then the shooter is not only not put in prison but CONTINUES TO OWN GUNS!? Jesus fuck. Rocks and bottles do not a gun make.  




 How bizarre; the guy seems to attract trouble. So many arrests / violent run-ins. Dangerous human being.  




 Hernandez was only confirmed as the shooter through Bay County Court documents. According to court records, Hernandez was in another room of the apartment practicing form in front of the mirror and the gun  accidentally went off and went through the mirror and the wall and fatally injured the daughter, his attorney reported.

...

Hernandez and the girls mother, Cynthia Votta, had been in and out of child custody court since 2011, according to court records. Hernandez was awarded sole custody in 2013 after Votta moved out of the home without the children, court documents indicated. In September, a circuit court judge ratified Hernandezs award of custody. 














 My heart goes out to the family. The horror of the two younger children watching their father and older sister massacred by someone will affect them for life, I'm a mother as well and cannot fathom, yet the fact that I do imagine it makes me work harder to ensure we put an end to this kind of terrorism we are all threatened with daily in the US. No other developed nation has this kind of crazy gun violence taking out citizens on the daily and yet not a peep from those in charge of keeping the safety. I didn't hear any politicians comment on this at all; not one mention. 

As the mother's brother said, "no one needs a gun." He implored people to stop praying for an end to gun violence and take action 



















 Thanks for the work you're doing! As a mom raising a child in America, this is my biggest concern, gun violence. No other issue takes so many American lives daily and yet is not being combatted as it should be. Imagine if ebola were killing 83 of us per day.  









 He's not by anyone outside the wingnut fringe of god|gun worshipers.  




 I Hate Huckabee 




 The city's police chief, Tim Styka identified the dead Monday as 33-year-old Jonathan Stoffel, of Neenah, his 11-year-old daughter, Olivia Stoffel, and 31-year-old Adam Bentdahl of Appleton. Stoffel's wife, Erin, was shot three times, but survived and is hospitalized in critical condition.

Another family ruined by this fucking plague of guns and small-brained egotistical fucks. This guy was en route to becoming a police officer and in his anger, shot and killed a child.  









 I did not know who she was until reading about this event. TIL she thinks Obama's dad is secretly Malcom X. Well, secret except to her.  









 Curious how different those months were for the fetus vs a baby in a normal active mother. Having carried my own son to term, I often had internal conversational thoughts toward him while he was in my belly, touched my belly, etc. This makes me wonder if nurses spoke into the belly, or rubbed it etc. One would hope so.  




 There's a strange self-flagellation in America where people almost gag-reflex statements about why things can't be nicer / better / more effective here like other places. Fuck that shit. If you can't see a better future, go work on your imagination. Don't poison the environment with blanket denial based on pessimism. I'm all for input based in fact, but if you just come to say vague negatives for why berries specific suggestions aren't for us, g'wan now.  


































 He's by far the best Independent running as a Democrat, anyway. I love the guy!  




 Don't blame me, I voted for Kodos.  




 Any republican with sense would actually agree with this; Bernie is for the American people, the worker, the little guy, the boostrapper, doing the best for the strongest growth our country can muster. Seriously, all that shit the GOP talks but goes 180 against? This guy is the real deal.  




 No protections in place for American workers. [Here's a link talking about his stance on the TPP for example.](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/the-trans-pacific-trade-tpp-agreement-must-be-defeated?inline=file)  




 I wonder if the DNC will do him the same way the congressional dems have run away from every progressive move Obama has made?  




 When you wear shit stained glasses, Walker looks like a rose.  




 Agreed! We lost some good ones when Feingold and Kucinich were out.  




 Agree totally, if we move in a better direction in this country, the fringe right wing will fall off, Hillary's center-right coalition will be our conservative wing, and we will have an energized progressive left that moves toward a much healthier future. I have to be optimistic after suriviving Reagan, Bush I, Shrub and the return of Shrub...it's been a sad dismal drag to the right concluding with the obstructionist klan situation that's been fucking America over at every turn.  




 A woman had a bullet in her neck, the third of 7 shattered window incidents. Have you got a source that this is not bullets? Do share if so. Otherwise all accounts point to an ammosexual.  

















































 No shit. Hope they figure this out soon and before someone dies. The girl is still in the hospital who was shot last week. Fucking bullshit.  









 Stupid decision does not equal the theft of another's life. No one should take a life. People take drugs because our brains have receptors that often give positive feedback to the taker. If that is unacceptable in society, find a fucking civilized solution. A cage = a murder is not that solution.  




 Barbaric nation. Fuck the death penalty. Humans, evolve.  









 I hope this post is read by all. 
 




 Exactly. It's fucking despicable. I sit here with my young son and wonder WTF is going on with the USA, how fucked is it going to get? 

Every human - do not shoot/beat/sever spines of people. 

Every human - do not seek violent revenge. 

*please* 




 News reports have said that James Holmes bought his arsenal legally. But did he really? The mentally ill arent supposed to own guns, and is there anyone who thinks this guy wasnt wrong in the head? He supposedly was odd enough to creep out a Colorado gun range owner.

A report last year from the advocacy group Mayors Against Illegal Guns found that states arent doing enough to stop the mentally ill from getting firearms. After the Gabrielle Giffords shooting, the Wall Street Journal reported that the bar for banning someone from owning a gun is awfully high.

Ill say the same thing I thought after Seung Hui Cho went on his murderous rampage at Virginia Tech: How about requiring a co-signer for your gun license? This could be a family member, a friend, a co-worker, anyone who could swear he knew no reason you shouldnt have a gun.

 









 Also using appleTV as well as trying it out on my ipad / desktop - no hiccups at all. Don't have gigabit fiber, so for me this is wonderful. When I was using a friend's login and watching it as HBOgo, it did have hiccups.  




 Signed up. Fucking happy. I was one who bitched loudly about the lack of options for cord cutters specifically related to HBO, so I am one of the first to sign up for this. Curious how many people signed up in the first month so far... 




 Unfortunately we still do not question insanity before we sell ammo to people in the US. 

[...Holmes had purchased over 6,000 rounds of ammunition online in the weeks leading up to the tragic shooting.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/23/james-holmes-received-amm_n_3327140.html) 



















 Funny, American here and I frequently use sheie.  




 Human mountain goats. Or, Mountain Humans.  




 Wow, that's an incredible photo  




 As a single mom who is busy...basically always...I have had moments when I'm standing in the kitchen and the dishwasher is washing the dishes, the washing machine and dryer are also going, and i have a realization of how incredibly fucked I'd be without these machines. Meanwhile I can cook and code and pay my bills.  




 Fuck. This kind of moment is so important in understanding why everyday Germans were not able to stop the fascists. I studied the holocaust in college and remember thinking if every person in the German population had refused to go along, they Might have been able to stop it. But it would have taken a massive collective to do so.  




 Don't think it's a she? 



















 At this point I am glad for how the halfwit terrorists react to kindhearted people trying to stop death. Because they will be the nail in their own coffin as we overturn 2A to end this scourge.  




 In the same way that ISIS wins by killing people; they terrorize and bring fear and spark death and violence.  














 "Shortly before 2 p.m. Graham Anthony Pittman ignored the pleas of park rangers and shot himself in the head while sitting inside his Jeep Cherokee, according to Tony Underwood, special agent in charge with the State Bureau of Investigation." 

The report states that the younger Pittman, who was 28 and the father of two young children, shot himself in Morrow Mountain State Park in Stanly County, in full view of visitors, following a domestic dispute.


Rep. Pittman has championed expanding gun owner rights in the General Assembly and during his campaigns for the District 82 House seat. 


Pittman is the primary sponsor of a bill filed Tuesdaythe day after his sons suicidethat would prohibit any local government employees from enforcing federal firearms laws, unless by court order. The bill, titled the Gun Rights and Privacy Act, would also repeal local prohibitions against carrying concealed weapons, and would streamline the handgun permit while traveling across state lines and to make the purchase of a firearm more efficient.  









 Still worth getting it on record, and cc: the white house with your message. Fuck these so-called representatives who do nothing close to representing the people.  




 Right. It's just a message to the plutocrats and the Klan.  




 Fuck the GOP. Fuck them to hell.  









 No one has EVER assumed I was female online unless I have a female name or image next to my name. And yet here we are.  




 This is the clash of very-recent history and today in the US; there are now two generations born after the civil rights fights where people were killed for trying to gain voting rights, where government officials presided over brutal treatment of blacks - obviously not to say it's "fixed", but it isn't what it was. So the term is a clusterfuck because the history of race in America is. 
But even with these reminiscences, those times have the feel of distant history, of dusty newsreels and faded photographs. So the programs central focus is on what it calls the last lynching in the United States: the murder of Michael A. Donald, 19, by two young Ku Klux Klansmen in Mobile, Ala., in 1981. Or as Representative Artur Davis of Alabama, the third delegate Mr. Koppel spends time with, says, in the era of color TV.


James Knowles, one of the murderers, says on the program that he and his confederate, Henry Hays, the son of the local Klan chief, had randomly selected Mr. Donald as he was walking down a street one night. The two kidnapped him at gunpoint, then drove to a wooded area where they beat him and slit his throat. They returned to hang the body from a tree within view of the Hays family home.


The case became a landmark, though; after the men were convicted, Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center brought a federal civil suit on behalf of Beulah Mae Donald, the victims mother, connecting the murder to the Klan as an organization. In 1987 the jury returned a $7 million wrongful-death judgment, bankrupting the local chapter.

 There are always commenters on these stories saying "welp, shouldn't run from the cops"

These are the same people who would sign off on concentration camps during Nazi times. Gotta be a yes man, fascist and free.

 I try not to watch ISIS beheadings, or cop shooting videos - that kind of barbarism really fucks up your soul. I will however work to stop it by reading and being aware of it - not advocating ignoring, but watching such brutality is poison.  




 This same misogyny and harassment can also be seen with the Gunsense hashtag -- a hashtag used by gun safety advocates and Shannon Watts from Moms Demand -- a grassroots organization working for gun sense in our country. This hashtag is trolled regularly by pro-gun, NRA types which results in shameless comments. Shannon's tweets and Moms Demand tweets are also trolled non-stop.

As a matter of fact, if you say anything pro-gun safety you will be trolled -- hashtag or not -- by a legion of trolls. I have personally been the victim of that many times. But by far, nobody gets it worse than Shannon Watts of Moms Demand, and her organization. Check out her timeline on Twitter any time and you will see what I mean.

 














 The first time that I was posted to Washington, DC some years ago, the capital and suburbs endured a frightening few days at the hands of a pair of snipers, who took to killing people at random from a shooting position they had established in the boot of a car. I remember meeting a couple of White House correspondents from American papers, and hearing one say: but the strange thing is that Maryland (where most of the killings were taking place) has really strict gun laws. And I remember thinking: from the British perspective, those arent strict gun laws. Strict laws involve having no guns.


After a couple of horrible mass shootings in Britain, handguns and automatic weapons have been effectively banned. It is possible to own shotguns, and rifles if you can demonstrate to the police that you have a good reason to own one, such as target shooting at a gun club, or deer stalking, say. The firearms-ownership rules are onerous, involving hours of paperwork. You must provide a referee who has to answer nosy questions about the applicant's mental state, home life (including family or domestic tensions) and their attitude towards guns. In addition to criminal-record checks, the police talk to applicants family doctors and ask about any histories of alcohol or drug abuse or personality disorders.


Vitally, it is also very hard to get hold of ammunition. Just before leaving Britain in the summer, I had lunch with a member of parliament whose constituency is plagued with gang violence and drug gangs. She told me of a shooting, and how it had not led to a death, because the gang had had to make its own bullets, which did not work well, and how this was very common, according to her local police commander. Even hardened criminals willing to pay for a handgun in Britain are often getting only an illegally modified starters pistol turned into a single-shot weapon.


And, to be crude, having few guns does mean that few people get shot. In 2008-2009, there were 39 fatal injuries from crimes involving firearms in England and Wales, with a population about one sixth the size of Americas. In America, there were 12,000 gun-related homicides in 2008. 














 Officials didn't release any names and said it was unclear whose gun the boy used.


Well then their work is cut out for them. Track. That. Shit.
