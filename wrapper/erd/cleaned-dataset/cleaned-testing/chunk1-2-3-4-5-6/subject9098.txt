 We just have the anatomy of raptors in our heads from what we suspected them to look like millions of years ago.  Over that time I'm sure they have been able to evolve enough to put their long claws up to their mouths in order to think. 




 Like a whole bag of dicks! 




 And after too many uses you had to find just the right sweet spot on the switch to make the RCA input work through it. 




 That's because it's still the best multiplayer system to date! 




 I usually try to use a self checkout anymore so i can cram as much into as few bags as possible.  But you're saying that by putting my items together like this when going to a person would avoid the bagger person from using 13 bags for 15 items? 




 Oddly I agree with you here.  When I was in college and used a computer lab, cleaning the roller was one of the things I usually did. 




 The Big Lebowski is a good one to do this to considering how many times you have to watch it to get everything. 




 I don't think the success kid would hit the wrong link in the first place. 




 Goddammit!!  I lost! 




 Heck, everyone knows you can drive 5 mph above the speed limit and still not get pulled over. 




 I absolutely hate it when someone stands there and holds the door when you're 50 feet away yet.  It makes you feel like you should go faster since they are holding the door, but at the same time it pisses you off because you can't walk at your normal lazy pace! 




 You'll read anything on the cue cards.  And I mean anything! 




 If we were living 100 years in the past, then we wouldn't be able to read shit like this on the internet! 




 I'd say it's worth the risk of jail if it's already been censored for everyone. 




 So is the guy on the left his translator then? (I'm aware it's not Jackie Chan, so that answer is not necessary) 




 It definitely beats drinking at the bar the entire night.  Especially when you're going to be with the same group of people regardless where you drink. 




 I wonder how many facebook friends God has? 




 Bi-force? 




 You are very strong willed if you can wait until Christmas for all 3 of those games! 




 Is the guy in the bottom left supposed to be Canadian? 




 Team America!  Fuck Yeah!! 




 That would be fun to randonly run up to a mime like that and act like you ran into something.  Probably would catch him a bit off guard. 




 It looks like a shoe according to Family Guy. 









 I hear ebay calling for this little gem! 




 This is so true!  And then you don't even have to clean the dishes when you're finished! 




 I think concept 2 looks the best. 




 Wait, Gamestop was allowed to sell another game aside from MW3 during the launch? 




 Better learn some Austin Powers driving moves in order to get out of that situation! 




 And once one light goes out, they ALL go out!! 




 When my parents buit their house (in 1992) the entryway closet is where he put the switch for the outside outlets.  Although, they still take the lights down each year. 




 Yes, I'd say I agree that the method "works" better when working on inanimate objects. 




 He must not be very big.  Her mouth isn't open very wide. 




 So cussing up a storm to try to get something fixed doesn't work?  I never would have thought that. 




 Totally agree with this.  I've given up on even thinking that I'll actually do something in the morning before work. 




 With the lighting it sorta makes it look like a cult waiting for the time of ascension. 




 So the princess is in another castle then? 




 Some day I will have my own DK Arcade machine! 




 I'd say definitely good job for a last minute costume! 




 I like how the Rep says they have a rule saying they do not do refunds on downloaded games.  Then immediately following that statement says they will refund you with credit and remove the downloaded game from your account. 




 But it's always better on the original system compared to a ROM! 




 But it's worth it when you kill someone in a shooting battle with your last bullet that you just loaded into the gun! 




 Sorry, I meant it was after the system first launched, as in the first 6 months to a year.  Not just the actual launch titles on the first day.  Later in its life the prices decreased overall though. 




 I recall most 3rd party games being $70 when the system launched and 1st party games being $60.  May have been a few that I saw that were $80 though.  And later in the systems life these went down to $60 and $50 for the most part. 




 Good costumes.  Although you're missing the best driver....Donkey Kong! 




 Couldn't they have at least made the game a color version? 




 Hmm, so that explains why people have to wait so long to get actual assistance for Battlefield 3 problems. 




 It must come with free controller converter cables that aren't visible in the picture. 




 Oh, I see what you did there! 




 Same here.  Someone wanted me to join so i did just to check it out.  What am I supposed to do, write the same exact stuff that I put on facebook for the same people to read? 




 Looks like they just wanted to use you as a test dummy to see what would happen beyond the corner. 




 I can't stand it when people do that either, even when they aren't my games.  I'm glad I trained my younger brothers years ago that games need to be put back in cases and regardless how mad you get, you shouldn't throw a controller on the ground.  Or else you may face a week of not being able to play.  Now a days the game collection is in great shape and everything still works like new! 




 Is your wife's name Sheryl by any chance? 




 Holy balls, that is sweet! 




 Looks pretty interesting.  A slightly different take on a game that actually might require some thinking. 




 That is 2 1/2 minutes of my life gone.  But I'd say it was worth it. 




 More like a double crime since you technically took 2 great games down! 




 When he said 64, he may have been referring to a Commodore 64.  Either way....fail! 




 Must be a pretty exciting game if they don't even want to use the chairs right behind them! 




 Hmm, I must say that after almost 2 decades of playing the game I never noticed a difference in speed with the coins.  Of course I always use DK Jr when I play, which would be a faster top speed than most of the others to begin with.  I might have to do some testing to see if there is a noticable difference with coins now. 




 Sorry, only TWO people can have the same joke.  You're the third unfortunately. 




 That seems like the most logical way to go about this. 




 You just made me lose The Game!
http://www.losethegame.com 




 You got me.  I guess you get your free punch on my arm. 




 Don't forget to wash your hands!  You wouldn't want those shit particles accidentally being posted onto reddit! 




 On the older versions of the game the blue shell goes after the person in first at the time it's fired.  On the Wii version it changes targets to who is in first when it gets up to the front of everyone. 




 I don't think the coins made you go faster if you had more.  The point of the coins was so when you got hit by another kart you didn't spin out.  Each hit would make you lose a coin and when you were out and got hit by another kart you would spin out. 
























 Looks like you forgot to list Steam in the pic. 














 Vendor: Can I help you sir?
Me: Yes, I'll take a Big Dick and a Fuck Cunt please.
Vendor: That'll be $2 please.
Me (thinking in mind): Why haven't I come here before for this stuff? 









 My brothers and I still play Wrestlemania 2000 over No Mercy.  For some reason that game just stuck with us better. 




 Looks, good, but I think it would be better if she would have dressed up as Samus! 




 I was looking for Leo walking in the background. 




 The Cubs actually win the world series in BTTF.  That's who you need to bet on in 2015. 














 So um, how did it taste when it was ready? 









 The best I've ever found that was thrown out was a PS3 controller.  It needed taken apart and cleaned up, but it works just fine! 




 Good lord it's the loch ness monster!! 




 I was thinking the same thing in regards to people saying it's a relatives first meme. 



















 Haha, good one! 









 I always hope for this to happen when I get a friend request out of nowhere.  Never does though. 









 So apparently black clothes was the choice for the picture.  Looks like Will didn't get the memo. 




 And that means a lot more coming at the end of the year as opposed to the beginning. 




 At least the comic doesn't tell them about the arrow to the knee.  That could ruin the entire game for someone! 









 She could probably get the abortion at Costco. 



















 Doc, I think we've hit 88 mph! 




 But since this is random just for the sole fact that Ellemeno pointed out that is should be random, does that make this random pic relevant? 




 That's a start! 









 I agree on overhand on being the correct way too.  But it can vary per person. 









 And here all these years I thought you were supposed to bend backwards when playing limbo. 




 Holy crap, I had to do a double take with the picture.  My parents have a setup almost identicle to this one.  Except, they actually did put up a christmas tree in a different spot. 



















 That selection looks about right. 




 Why would you stop in the first place if it's only going to make you mad that you have to wait on a person crossing the road?  And it was your own choice. 




 When I was in college cars would stop on a regular basis and they were the LAST car going by.  Doing this only made things take longer for me walking and the driver. 




 I lost mine about a year ago.  GGG kept the cash for himself as a reward, but was kind enough to return everything else at least. 




 Oh, I get it. [Filmsy](http://www.filmsy.com/) 




 And then goes to the bar! 




 You could hang out a lot in freshly stacked haystacks with people who need hay... 




 Although I have never seen or read any of the Harry Potter's, I still find this pretty amusing. 




 SIMPSONS DID IT....er wait, different episode. 




 I see what a person is doing when paying a homeless person like this.  But lets say someone paid a homeless person $5 just to do this.  To justify that money you would have to be gone for more than $5 worth of parking in that spot. 




 A ticket pulls in more money than an extra $.50 in a parking meter is probably the main reason. 




 Since a little over 10 years have passed already , you actually only have just a hair over 12 years left to wait.  That time will fly by! 




 Ah, I guess I missed the really small one above the plate before.  I'd say it's small anough it shouldn't count anyhow. 




 Watching 6 movies with only 5 screens.  Wizardry? 




 They're going to get neck cramps looking up like that the whole time. 




 So why is he questioning his answer yes? 




 Makes me think of Wrestlemania 2000 on the N64. The game came out in 1999, but it lets you input dates for when you win a belt back to something like 1955.

 




 6 months?  So did Easter get moved back, or Christmas moved up? 




 I believe the blu ray release that is coming out next year for the 30th anniversary is putting the guns back in again. 




 So no one washes their face with soap?  Because when you do that you're also cleaning your eyebrows in the process.  Unless I've been fooling myself this whole time. 




 So where do I place my order? 




 My plan was to buy the book from the store and use it until the last day for full refunds.  Then order the book through the library and use that copy for free the rest of the quarter. 




 Problem 4 on page 87 has been changed.  Because of that, wecan't use the previous version anymore. 




 I kind of feel like I have a connection with each of you just because I work at Ohio State!! 




 She must be an avid Portal player! 


































 [FALSE!](http://qkme.me/3p6rjm) 




 Wha...what's the point of taking all the time to make this when you're just going to eat it a few hours later? 














 Only 303 views of the video as of me writing this, but 555 comments on here?  So apparently only a few people on reddit even watch the video before commenting on it? 




 "How does a human notice that" - Wouldn't it seem more natural to say person instead of human?  Or is the comment from some alien race? 




 There was a time lapse video on yahoo this past week showing the entire progress of the tower.  It was pretty cool to watch. 














 Should have used obtuse instead of stupid. 




 It's a rug, not carpet. 




 Purchase bullets for each shot made in game. 




 My co workers are this way.  It's impossible to get a sentence in as a response. 









 I was referencing one on the advice animals front page using cats that I know has been used before.  As I'm sure mine has been used before too. 









 My brothers and I wonder what we're going to do with our title belts after 2049 for Wrestlemania.  That's as far as the pre programmed dates go. 




 And Miners Cave for me! 









 So who else looked real close to find the one country that said something other than "people"? 









 So you are showing her that prayer actually does work? 




 I loved the original game, but unfortunately never played through it all.  The time and amount of load screens was unbearable.  I would love a remake it that was taken care of! 




 But why did you each make a full sandwich on your own and then put it on the earth?  You should have each just used 1 piece of bread with toppings on one side and put that on the ground.

 a brief history of [Playstation controllers](http://imgur.com/1GHkf). 




 I was always aware that running at an angle was faster, but how do you know the speed difference as being 1.41? 




 I beat him this way as well since I didn't know about the controller port change. 




 One could only hope that is what his activities involve. 









 Good luck making that cash.  That comes out to 62.5 smudges you'd have to average per minute.  so roughly one per second. 




 Sorry, I don't watch the show myself, so I'm not sure what websites might have it posted for you to watch. 




 Now if you use this at work, is there a way it can block your internet browsing activity from the company too? 




 New episode this coming Wednesday after the new South Park actually. 









 Looks like OP spelled Taco Bell wrong. 




 Had the same thing when I was younger.  Now I've got the dvd in place of it. 




 I know it's no building, but an [elevator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator) is a start. 




 Repost, of course. 




 I have never worked at a small local pizza place, but I agree with you.  I grew up in NW Ohio where all the towns were small (~1,200 people) and the price of pizza is around what you are saying. 




 So was OP sitting in a shopping cart also when taking the bottom picture? 









 He doesn't look very happy.  Must have to go to work for the day. 




 Why did that show ever have to end? 




 TMNT - Turtles in Time 




 Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo 




 Donkey Kong Country Returns 




 Did you say [2-ply toilet paper](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EE01Sbb8CU)?  It's at the very end, just wait for it. 




 True, the opening sequence would show it before each episode, but we were thinking in the actual show. 




 My brother and I were wathcing an episodes of King of the Hill last night and he brought up the fact that he couldn't think of a single episode where there wasn't at least one alcoholic beverage (usually beers in the alley) drank.  He's more of a fan than I am of the show, but I was trying to think of one as well and could come up with an episode.  Anyone know if there is a way to verify something like this? 




 Mario Kart 64 









 Just start clicking and eventually you find your way to safety at the end and everything is finally explained about what happened. 














 If Midway's building was on fire, this would make sense to all of us. 









 Read this on my phone and kept rotating it to read easier. The damn meme kept rotating with the screen and I couldn't win! 














 Exact same thing I was thinking. 




 Michigan....sorry to hear that. 




 You mean the long long ago. 




 Everyone has to start at the bottom! 





























 Yeah, the difference in controllers were because of different [regions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamepad#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System.2FSuper_Famicom) 




 Actually, it's "R" and "ZR", not "Z1".  But still no R1 either. 




 With the strength of 5 gorillas! 




 No it isn't, but Miracle Whip is.  Next question. 




 If it was a Buffalo Wilds Wings commercial then they forgot to make the game go into overtime. 




 All that technology, but they can't put arm rests on the seats? 




 The only flaw in your argument is that the top and bottom of the stall are open to release the gasses you speak of.  Therefore, the crack is not necessary. 




 So who else wanted to click on the OK button? 




 So why did the Wii's price inflate by $35 since launch, but the PS3 deflated by $30 when they were lanched 2 days apart from each other? 




 Ohio State does that. 




 That's why Harry and Lloyd drove across the country in Dumb and Dumber.  Much cheaper. 




 I like to think of Jesus as little baby Jesus. 




 At first I thought it was just a fat co worker going to get some food.  Then I later learned of the real danger I was actually in. 




 And I got mad when my brothers messed up a box that the N64 game was kept in. 




 There could be anything in the mystery box.  It could even be a boat!  You know how much we've wanted one of those! 




 The Big Lebowski, actually twice.  Dude - "I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off."  And again the Dude - "I mean we totally fucked it up, man.  We fucked up his pay-off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh?

 









 Thanks, I'll try there! 














 Oh sure George Costanza, always leave on a high note! 




 Would you like some gum to make you feel better? 




 I have the copier room to duck off to in my office.  If people are in there I just act like I'm looking for something that printed, then seemed baffled when my paper didn't print for some reason. 




 I loved Burn After Reading.  But several of my friends watched it and just said it was dumb and won't give it another watch through.  Because I think this is a movie that needs to be seen more than once in order to get everything. 




 I love this movie too!  Even my brother who doesn't care for Star Wars gave it a watch and he enjoyed it too. 









 Wait a second.  How did you take a picture of the chair full of clothes if you are asleep? 




 I am guessing he just painted those games.  But I don't think he said for sure. 




 In the original post he states that they are actually all old sports games and they printed off labels of the games you see.  Otherwise this would be tragic to waste that many copies of a good game. 




 I always thought loading bars were to let you know how much time you had to drink until the game was ready to play? 




 I think guys standards go down with age.  This therefore makes the attractive girls looks that much better in perspective. 




 I think so.  Maybe someone should combine the two movies and see what happens with no sight or hearing. 




 Some others I can think of would be:
Clerks 1 and 2,
BASEketball,
Ghostbusters,
Tremors (only the first one),
Big Lebowski,
See no Evil, Hear no Evil,
UHF,
American History X 




 This works until they are digging through dumpsters for bottles and half the trash ends up outside of the dumpster by the time they are done. 




 So you've seen the movie even though it hasn't been released yet?  How is this possible? 




 I hate to say it, but I kinda agree with you. 




 Nope, not Brandon. So you can cross that name off your list of possibilities. 









 This is how I imagine it would be for me to try to get a decent picture of something while on the road. 




 I was just kidding when i worded it that way. 




 I'm not sure I can justify $4,000 just for karma on here. 









 A little anti-aliasing would help out his tie. 









 Am I the only person who actually kept my games in the boxes they came in? 









 Did he finally get arrested by the cop and is now sitting in jail? 




 I'd say it's a springboard from Portal 2. 




 Ha, thanks for the approval! 









 The question is, does he do this every morning too? 














 Is [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestar_Runner_Characters#The_Poopsmith) who you're talking about? 




 I'd say more like overly attached wife in 25 years. 




 I think it's the fact that as you grow up you actually expand your horizons. 




 That would seem like a simple choice.  The PS2 will play any PS1 games for you.  So why not save $10. 




 Well, you didn't want to leave a surface uncovered in case that was the one area you needed to place a portal. 









 Hope you brought an umbrella.  Otherwise the rain will get you all wet when you get out of the lake. 




 My name is Voit, dumbass. 




 Tommy Pickles?  Oh wait, wrong show. 




 And with the small trophy presentation have the Karate Kid music "You're the BEST aroooouuuund" playing! 




 I'm not sure if you spelled BLEEEUUUUUGHRRGHUUUUGUUHBL  correctly. 




 My dad is the janitor at my local high school.  For some reason he seems to be the favorite employee for almost all of the students.  He usually dones't say much and almost never smiles at people.  I ask others what makes my dad so likable, but they don't really have an answer.  But whatever it is, it seems to be working. 




 And so would your little sister. 




 Really? 





























 I honestly don't know why people say this was so tough.  Maybe it's because I grew up playing the old DK and DK Jr games.  Although it was mostly on the NES. 




 Bond sure has changed a lot since Daniel Craig. 




 Lesbian seagull 




 Am I too late to have a comment that hasn't been taken and will be recognized? 









 Agreed.  Weekends are OK though since there is no work. 









 Although Back to the Future would be a good direction to point them.  I think in this case the South Park episode where Cartman freezes himself for a Wii would help explain things better. 









 Thanks.  We weren't looking to sell them.  Just curious if they did have any value but we couldn't find anything online since the box was blank. 




 My dad got these out over Christmas while the family was home.  The figures are each about 1.5" tall.  It has 2 figures of JFK at the end of it.  The box isn't in the best of shape, but there isn't any information on it to even try to look up. 









 I took these numbers as total profit made since Nintendo got into the video game scene.  Same with the Sony and Microsoft numbers. 




 Hmm, that could make it interesting for me to try watching it then. 














 Me and a friend were sitting in our living room watching tv.  We realized that there were 2 shows on later at the same time that we wanted to watch.  My friend calls my roommate (who is upstairs) to ask him to set his VCR (yes, before dvr was the norm) to record one of the shows instead of one of us walking up the stairs to tell him. 




 Big Lebowski, Toy Story, Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, Jurassic Park 




 Not sure if I'm missing something, but why is the gold N64 only $149, but the standard one is $199?  Am I looking at something wrong? 









 That was my standard day trying to study when I was in college.  Be at the library reading for about half an hour, take about an hour nap at the table, then study for about another half hour before finally going home. 




 At least you lived long enough to post the picture. 




 Wrestlemania 2000 is the one that gets played to this day with me and my brothers.  Although we do have No Mercy as well. 




 So what does owning a construction company have to do with this? 




 The 2 digit number on the bottom of an anheuser busch can lets you know what time of day it was produced.  Every 15 minutes is an extra digit for the number.  Example: 2:00 am = 08 









 He was way ahead of his time. 




 I have jumped in the lake for the past 10 years, and it has only snowed once during that entire time.  So it seems pretty rare when it does snow. 









 It all depends on who sees it first in r/new if you ask me. 




 Guitar Hero was on 2 games ahead of Rock Band because the first game came out 2 years ahead of the first Rock Band.  Not because they came out with multiple full fledged sequels that often.  But you are correct with the spinoffs that Guitar Hero put out in a short period of time. 




 It's been a while since I've played this, but I thought it was off by one.  So to get the star, you'd actually press the button when the mushroom before the star was in the center of the screen.  and all three rows worked the same way. 




 Are there only 5 levels to the DK Arcade game?  Or are you just throwing a number out there?  Because I have not been able to get through the arcade game myself. 




 And I still read it the correct way on here too. 




 As a bonus, Tom Hanks is still listed as being in the movie! 




 I'm probably one of the few people that actually played through the entire game. 




 True 




 Can't say I'm beta spaghetti pants.  So it looks like the bill would be split 3 ways. 









 Although they are delicious, I'd say that sour patch kids are one step better. 









 And for those who want the [sound effects](http://nooooooooooooooo.com/) with it. 









 I really wanted to see Richard Duncan out there debating! 









 So this is like the Cleveland Show?  Except instead of the bear living next door, it lives with them? 




 TBDBITL! 




 The summers were great for me back in those times.  My dad is the custodian at my school and during the summers he could take a computer home with him and a copy of each of the games.  That way the computers did sit around dormant for 3 months straight. Hours upon hours of Number Munchers, Miners Cave, Odele Lake, etc. 




 So why are you digging through your neighbors trash to begin with? 




 The black one with the big X on it is what I'm referring to.  That would be Xbox. 




 [This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Call) is what I was thinking of.  But I really doubt it's referring to the same thing as the article on here. 




 Why does the Xbox controller look so pissed to be with all the others? 




 I think it's sending the signal to space to hopefully contact [aliens](http://qkme.me/3raohs) 




 I'll have to take some time to look through these to help get ideas for this year. 




 But why is he in timeout and sitting in the corner? 




 Woops, I guess I didn't even look at it.  I was looking through posts regarding Ohio State doing a video game themed show from this past weekend and just assumed it was that same show.  My bad. 




 Yeah, Ohio State does do a different half time show every week.  It surprises me how they can learn that stuff so quickly.  3 weeks ago they did one honoring NASA and Neil Armstrong which was pretty neat too. 




 From what I read a few months back, I believe they are going to remain their own country and won't be considered part of Fuji. 




 I think tv executives have already taken care of this question. 




 I went to a public school and had 61 kids in my class.  A neighboring town has around 35 for an average class size. 




 So piss comes out of the faucet? 




 Will Smith and Matthew McConaughey?  How did they get on here? 




 [Stunt Cycle](http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=1280 st=2) is what I had.  And I actually still have it in working condition to this day. 




 I just assumed it was another day when they were there, and not immediately after all the destruction. 




 I was a little afraid to click on it when i read "chat roulette" in the title. 




 Amen to that! 
























 So why do these people "like" Xbox on facebook if they're just going to do this? 




 I answer my phone with Ahoy-hoy, just like Mr. Burns. 




 In regards to physical media, how do I lose my games if my Wii U quits working on me?  I can still just buy a new system, just like I would have to do with the PS4 or Xbox1, and play all the games I previously purchased. 




 Can't say I've ever seen Father of the Bride.  But here's [Animaniacs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy6_b0qhjpg) episode it's also in. 




 Hell yeah, Animainiacs reference!! 




 Makes you feel like you're defusing a bomb with all those colored ends. 




 I'm pretty sure it was asking what the worst game you've ever played was.  Otherwise you're just going off of what other people have said. 




 I have mostly stuck with just watching the Star Wars movies. But my friend said his 10 year old daughter asked this question about characters names in the Clone Wars. I tried doing some searching myself but can't seem to find anything. 









 Hey, I actually beat someone this weekend then with my 105! 




 All 5 of those guys are above 20 on ESPN so it has to be a different site. 




 I'm still surprised that Benny Parsons and Red Byron haven't been inducted yet! 




 I honestly think 5 per year is too many.  In 10 years the requirements to be on the ballot are going to be pretty low if you ask me.  Nascar doesn't have large teams like other sports do which gives them more options to pick from each year. 




 I'm still surprised Benny Parsons hasn't been inducted yet! 




 Two of my favorites are "Hold on" by Korn and "Lose Yourself" by Eminem.  I tend to prefer more upbeat paced songs for my entire runs too. 




 I've been there several times and as long as you're about 20 rows up or more you can see the entire track fine pretty much anywhere.  From there it's basically what part of the track you would prefer to sit near for the different action. 




 So are you trying to deplete all your funds within the first few races?  Haha 




 I don't see Gordon doing a part time schedule along the lines of Mark Martin.  If anything I think he would be in just a handful of races a year if he did go the part time route. 




 I had that about 2 years ago with a group of kids about 10 years old.  I thought to myself, "do they even know who Forrest Gump is?" 




 Would this be it?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSOI1nvXuJQ 




 To go along with this, if a number is slanted forward on the drivers side, then it will be slanted backwards on the pasengers side of the car.  They keep the standard look of the number regardless of where it's placed on the car. 




 I'm pretty sure Jeff Hammond is just FOX's bitch and they send him to the worst spots around the track to do a 10 second segment just to fuck with him. 




 I don't mind Bowyer myself, but for some reason my brother just hates him. 




 That's true, but if you think about it, while the air titans are on the track that would most likely mean that the surface is too wet to even want to have the cars out there yet to help dry it. 




 I wish I was BIG!! 









 Ha, now that would be interesting to see. Actually I just want to see Jr. Wreck. 




 Thanks. That's what I was looking for. 




 I know Hamlin would get the points for the race since he starts, but who,s name would actually be listed as the race winner? 




 I agree.  If he wins 2 races he'll essentially be in the chase since the guys he mostly racing against for 20th are second tier teams.  And the past 2 years with the wild card only had 1 driver each year with more than 1 win not in the top 10. 




 I went with 2 of my brothers last year and we got there around 3pm.  It would have been sooner, but my brothers aren't too motivated to get up in the morning and our hotel was in downtown Charlotte.  We didn't have any trouble with parking.  It was about half a mile south of the track in a free lot.  I would recommend getting there sooner though if you feel like walking around and being able to check out a good amount of the stuff there. 




 When someone says that NASCAR isn't a sport because it's just cars driving in circles, I usually bring up the fact that they are just dumbing down what is actually going on.  If you explain basketball or football like that, then both of those sports are just running up and down a court/field tossing a ball around.  Doesn't sound too exciting that way.  Same with baseball, it's just guys standing around 95% of the time scratching themselves with someone throwing a ball every once in a while.  At least in NASCAR there's action going on 100% of the time during a race.  Granted some of the action is better than other times.  But essentially no other type of sport can make that claim.  Another point I'll make is that the majority of the NASCAR driversa are just as in shape, if not better, than a lot of athlese in other sports.  If this doesn't get through to them to at least acknowledge you have to be athletic to race, then they are just being ignorant. 




 I would say pretty much anything by Pantera except this song.  Mostly because it's the ONLY song by them that a radio station will play. 




 My brother and I still think of the rocking chairs that FOX gave both Mark and Rusty in 2005 for their retirements.  Rusty has been rocking away in his chair just waiting on Mark to retire and finally use his too. 




 I noticed this in the Texas race results too.  Except Dave Blaney was one of the 4 in a row. 




 Can someone tell me why Truex was penalized on pit road earlier? I thought the announcers said it was because the crewmen weren't over the wall before he left the pit stall.  But I've never heard of that before. 




 Brilliant! 




 I didn't think they were picked as the random car for inspection for the races after Talladega.  I thought NASCAR said they were going to inspect his car along with the other standarad cars that get picked. 




 I'll be down there this weekend for my first Martinsville dogs. 









 I think it's entirely possible.  Through 5 races he currently has 145 points, and Ryan Newman in 20th has 121 points.  If you figure the person in 20th roughly doubles their points over the next 5 races that would give them 242.  So Hamlin would only be maybe 100 points out of 20th when he returns.  He will need 2 wins for sure, possibly 3 to get a wild card spot in the chase though. 









 I would have to say the [T-Rex](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkEVKzZNQDY) is the best demo on the original Playstation. 




 Hopefully it's not rain for the entire day.  Then we can finally see the new track dryers in action! 









 You have an initial budget of $100 and need to buy 5 drivers.  You can either try to buy 5 guys in the middle of the pack to have an overall good group.  Or you can spend the big bucks and get a top driver or two, but then sacrafice it by having to pick at least one lower level crappy driver to be able to afford all of them.  If your driver's value goes up, then you can sell them at a higher level than you bought them at and your entire salary cap increases.  For example: You buy someone that costs $20 and after 3 weeks they now are worth $21.  If you sell them, then your total salary cap will go up by $1.  But the same is true for drivers who go down in value.  You can sell them at a loss and take a hit, or you can try to ride them out and hope their value goes back up.   




 Walmart almost decided to become a primary sponsor for Jeff Gordon just a few years [ago](http://aol.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2010-08-24/walmart-in-negotiations-to-sponsor-jeff-gordon).  Not sure on the reason off hand for why the decided against it. 




 I doubt walking from the track to call a cab would make much difference.  At least I wouldn't think so from the way things looked to me last year. 




 My brothers and I went to the All Star race and Coke 600 last year for the first time.  Our hotel was downtown Charlotte and we drove to each of the races.  Basically for driving I took it easy to drive back each night.  Cooler sized for the track are 14" cube and it can be a hard or soft cooler.  As for leaving, once the race was over we hung out around our poarking lot for about 45 minutes which is about when traffice was starting to get thinner in our lot (still a LOT faster than Michigan takes to clead out).  So a cab probably won't work the best for leaving the track.  If your hotel is in the track area, you may be able to just walk the distance depending on where it is of course. 




 Wow, I don't know how I never realized that from all the times I've watched it. 




 * Korn - Follow the Leader
* Nine Inch Nails - Pretty Hate Machine
* Live - Throwing Copper 




 It's plumber action man! 




 Not really a big party or anything, but about 12 or so people were in my apartment drinking when I was in college.  The outside doors were closed since it was fairly cold outside.  Someone came in and went straight to the kitchen fridge.  He heads back out the door with our ketchup in his hands and says "now all I need to do is find a hot dog" and left.  We were all just kinda in shock wondering what the heck just happened. 




 Women shopping for groceries. 




 Agreed.  I was thinking the same thing. 




 I agree the new setup is terrible.  I use Jayski.com and msn.com for most of my news.  And for some odds and ends stuff I go to racing-reference.info 




 MY MANWICH! 




 Fuck you replacement friends! 




 What about the mornings you don't wake up? 




 I believe I did. 




 Kind of the opposite with a city boy moving to the country side, but Son in Law.  Pauly Shore!! 




 And it still is a number. 









 Ikaruga on the Gamecube 




 Or possibly live out a real life Idiocracy. 









 While I find this stuff interesting, can anyone explain how a telescope like this can be focused on such a specific area for hours as the article mentions?  Wouldn't the rotation of the earth have an effect on it?
