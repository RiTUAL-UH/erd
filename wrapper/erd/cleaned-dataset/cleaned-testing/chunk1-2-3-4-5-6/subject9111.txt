 That's hecka creepy. Imagine if someone hacked into a nanny cam along with the monitor. They could watch you and talk to you but you would have no freakin idea who/where/why. 
























 That would be horrifying, but at least there is plenty of evidence. Also, a basic drawing or blueprint of your floor would help greatly. 
























 Ugh, this is too real. I sleep on an air mattress with only a snuggie for a blanket. So I'm low to the ground and barely covered, and the other night I woke up at like 2am and my blanket was hanging over the back of my desk chair. Long story short I was very cold for the rest of the night. 
























 I still think Mr. Green is behind everything. Maybe he killed his wife or maybe she really did commit suicide, Nicole doesn't give much detail about the wife, and consequentially whatever motives Mr.Green might have for killing her. However, either way it would be easy to find a motive for him killing all those high school girls. Plus he would have the strength, influence, and access to the school to pull off something like multiple murders of students at the school. As for Nicole missing, Mr.Green knows she is looking into the murders quite a bit, is somewhat estranged from her father who does happen to be an ex-cop, and she looks up to himself as an uncle. This would be the perfect opportunity to not only get rid of a possible future liability, but to also fulfill the the last letter of his wife's name. Most likely he completed the "ritual", for lack of a better term, at his house when she came over for tea. It sure doesn't seem like the authorities questioned him very well. I would say press harder on Mr.Green, he may be holding her for some reason, at the very least I believe he knows more than he is leading on. Good luck and I hope you find your daughter sir. 
























 Ha ha nope. that's when you get a new job. 
























 Ah yes, the Normal Things store. Of course, that is where I go to get my normalpornfornormalpeople
