 Mine generally have to be in omelet form. Scrambled is a weird texture, and if the yolk and whites are separate, I can't stand the taste. Mushroom, tomato, onion, pepper, and cheese omelet is my favorite. 

As a kid and even a teen, I hated beans, but since becoming vegetarian I have tried them again and opened up to them. 

Ice cream is obviously delicious, but milk has always been my beverage of choice. 

I looked for my main nutrition book to see if I could find any more information, but it's back at my parents' place. When I go home for thanksgiving I'll see if it has anything else to say about it and if it has anything about nutrition and depression. 

Where are you looking to attend and what do you want to major in? Anything science tends to do that until enough information, research, and studies are available to come to a definite conclusion. In all of my classes I have been taught omega 3 is beneficial. 

Me too, I just searched my schools courses to see if any went over nutrition and depression/anxiety, but I wasn't able to find anything.

I've started searching online for local psychiatrists/therapists, and it is slightly overwhelming.  

Respecting my likes and dislikes is something I need to work on. I don't mind going to the bar and being social, but I'm kind of past the drunken college party scene. 

I know you said changing your diet helped, but are you also currently taking any medication or seeking counseling? (I apologize if you've already covered this, I'm on my phone and I'm not sure how to see previous posts while typing a reply. :/) 




 Such a simple phrase, yet that would probably solve half the problem. Thank you for sharing.  




 I keep telling myself it will pass, but it hasn't.  




 I eat eggs occasionally, but have always been super picky with how they have to be cooked, otherwise I don't like the taste. 

The best sources for protein are definitely from meat, dairy products are also good and grains have some protein, but not much. I get most of my protein from dairy products and beans. I absolutely love milk and skim actually has more protein than whole milk.

If you're interested in studying nutrition, go for it. There is a lot of information out there and you could easily purchase books and learn a lot on your own. Just make sure they are credible. Nutrition is just my minor, but in my spare time I try to learn as much as I can.  




 Nutrition is one of the things I'm studying in school, and what you're saying makes a lot of sense. I've been pescatarian (vegetarian but eats seafood) for about 8 months now, and I'm sure I have several deficiencies based on my diet that hasn't helped my depression.  




 Exactly. If I could pinpoint it, then I could fix it. 

I'm sorry you're in the same boat. I wouldn't wish this feeling on anyone.  




 The word mate makes me smile. 

Have you found anything that helps? 




 Definitely not the answer I was looking for, but it makes sense.  




 Are meds really the only option? I was on some meds for about two months and I hated it, haven't been on them in almost a year and I really don't want to be. :/  




 Definitely going to print that off the next time I'm in the computer lab.

Thank you.  




 Words cannot describe how much what you said is what I needed to hear.  




 Thank you. :)  




 I also really don't want to be put on medication, and when I went to my family doctor, that was the first and only thing she did. 




 I know for me to actively seek out a therapist is probably the hardest thing for me, but probably the best step for me as well. I've admitted to myself that something isn't right, but if I admit it to someone else, that would mean I can't pretend that I'm okay anymore. 

One of my biggest fears is being told by a therapist that I need to just get over it - I know how ridiculous that sounds.  




 Which is more helpful, seeing a therapist or a psychiatrist?  




 I've thought about seeing someone, but I'm really bad at communicating how I feel and opening up to a stranger. Was it hard at first for you to open up? 




 Thank you. :)  




 I'm finding more and more uses for the blowtorch. Just used it to make Smores in my kitchen. Best investment ever.  




 Used this recipe http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/vanilla-bean-creme-brulee-recipe/index.html and used an entire vanilla bean instead of only half. Struggled with the blowtorch part a bit though, in the pic you can see some of the sugar wasn't completely caramelized, but on other ones I ended up burning it. Any suggestions? 









 I used to have a hedgehog named Popcorn, and this makes me miss him. This is adorable. :)  




 In the basement of Robinson is also an old butcher area and the freezers are creepy.  




 Even if the save battery dies, they are super easy to replace.  




 I feel your pain, the only internship I could find was nonpaying, but what makes it worse is I need the internship for graduation and thus I am paying for the credits.

I pay to go to work everyday... 




 What to expect: They will prick your finger before you can give blood to test your iron.  




 Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs - any good? 




 Call at age 5 to explain that there was nothing I could do to stop my grandpa and uncle from committing suicide, and to not waste the next 17 years trying to please everyone and feeling like a failure when I'm not successful. Because 1. It is impossible to please everyone, 2. Pleasing everyone won't bring my grandpa and uncle back, and 3. Even if people seem happy on the outside, it doesn't mean everything is okay on the inside. 




 I got glasses for the first time in 2nd grade and made the same discovery - I told everyone because I wanted to make sure everyone knew that trees had leaves. 
























 I'm not good at showing emotions so I just ate them and said how great they were.   




 My sister thinks I'm going through a phase and am crazy, yet at the same time she is one of my supporters.  




 Exactly. My parents keep vegetarian burgers, lasagnas, etc in the freezer for when I come home to visit. It's nice then even though I don't live with them, they want to make sure I have quick and easy access to food when I'm around.  




 I've been a fish eating vegetarian (pescatarian) for about 10 months now and the hardest part is family gatherings especially around holidays. Today is my family's Christmas get together and for Christmas we do a lot of finger foods: meatballs, ham rollups, veggies, etc. One of my favorite foods are my mom's ham rollups. I could easily eat a whole platter. I have never asked my family to change their recipes or make special accomodations for me - it's never been an issue finding something to munch on. Well today as we are setting the table, I notice something different, my mom made vegetarian ham rollups. Instead of wrapping the pickle and cream cheese spread in ham, she wrapped them in a spinach leaf. They tasted so good, even some of my meat eating family were snacking on them, I actually had to make sure I got some because the regular ham rollups were being ignored. 

This small gesture meant a lot to me, and I just wanted to share with you how awesome my mom is.  




 Inconceivable!  




 I'm sorry. I suppose I have some pretty understanding friends/family. I've received some grief from meat eaters, but I tend to brush it off and move on. I also found not mentioning it helps. Many of my friends don't even realize I'm pescatarian. Got to be stealthy. ;)  




 I'm pescatarian and it makes it easier. Make fish or order fish at a restaurant is easier than ordering vegetarian or vegan. My family loves that I'm not full out vegetarian because they can cook one meal everyone will eat. 




 WARNING: Has the emotional stability of an 8 year old.  




 Do you still need six and seven? 




 I know the feeling. I actually deleted my Facebook a couple months ago and it was the best thing for me. 
I've gotten closer with my few close friends, I've stopped worrying about what is going on in the lives of people who I used to know and comparing them to myself. I've even had some old friends reach out through phone calls and texts to see what's new in my life. The things I would want to post and sometimes did post, I now turn to my friends about and they've been a lot more helpful than I'd ever imagine.  




 As a Stephen King fan, I am super jealous. I own maybe ten of his books, but my goal is to have a Stephen King bookshelf one day. Thanks for sharing. :)  




 You are correct. Anyone can call themselves a nutritionist, but a dietician requires school, internship, and then an exam to become certified. 

Source: Once was a Dietetic major. 




 I will. Thank you!  




 Thank you. 




 Thank you for sharing what you went through. It's nice to know others have gone through the same thing. 

I've started searching for a good psychiatrist near me. 

Funny you should mention reading. Growing up I'd escape inside a book daily, but with school and work I haven't found time lately. Well last night I pushed everything aside and read just a few chapters of a non school related book. I've missed that.  




 I've contemplated driving recklessly into a tree. 




 To me up north was always the UP. 




 Mt pleasant is not up north....is it? 




 That's why I generally resort to saying "I'm tired" or "I'm stressed"
 




 True, I wouldn't want to put someone through that.  




 Thank you so much for taking the time to respond to all my questions. It really means a lot. :) 




 I've gone to the free services on campus before, but they don't really know how to deal with things like this. You get x amount of free visits and they are more for homesickness, help adjusting to college, balancing work and school, and various things like that. Their advice to me was "get involved on campus" and you'll feel better. Not really helpful in my case. :/  




 Thank you. I'm not ready to give up yet.  




 Getting hit by a car is another one that crosses my mind sometimes.  




 Have you had any negative side effects from taking GABA? 

Thank you for sharing what worked for you. :)  




 Same here.  




 Couldn't have said it better myself.  




 I work out when I can, could probably do it more often though. 

Slightly afraid of AD side effects, but also against the idea of them in general 
- I don't like taking medication in general.  
























 It has "Schick" written on the case and the end of the handle. I've done some research and I think it is a Schick Krona, but not real certain. I've been lurking on here for awhile, doing research before I went and bought my first razor, but then I found this while on vacation and impulsively purchased it. Is this a good choice for a first razor, or should I look for an alternative?  









 I've found that keeping my hands busy really helps me. Lately, including tonight, whenever I feel restless and in need of a distraction, I grab some hemp and make a bracelet. Something about the different knots and the repeating motion is soothing and helps distract me and calm me down. 




 Sounds exactly like my past two days. Hope yours goes better. If you need someone to talk to, I'm a good listener.  




 I may regret this, but all jokes are welcome.
I've been feeling down all day, so if it makes me laugh - I'm game. 




 I'll pick someone at 9:00pm Eastern Time


*Update

Thank you everyone for all of your jokes, they have brightened up my night. I was unable to just pick one, so I've selected ClassyAssBitch and johannvaust. I've messaged them and waiting to hear back.


**Update ClassyAssBitch has received their gift card. Still waiting on johannvaust 




 I tried to make some a couple years ago and forgot to grease and powder the pan. Trust me when I say that is the most important step.  




 I live about a mile from campus and walk, unless the weather is really bad or I'll be on campus way past dark. I hate when circumstances arise where I feel like I need to drive. I end up having to leave earlier because otherwise I won't find a spot, or students walking will cause me to sit at a stop sign for a solid 5 minutes. On top of that, there is the problem of feeding the meter every two hours so I don't get a ticket. Driving to campus really is more of a hassle than walking.  




 My roommate and I are both vegetarians. When we need our fast food fix we go to BK for the veggie burgers. Asking for a whopper with the vegetarian meat is my favorite.  




 I'm 22 and still have some servers treat my friends and I like shit because they think college kids tip poorly. I have always tipped upwards of 25% or more for good service, but if a server is terrible - I'm not afraid to leave as little as 5% tip.  




 I'm terrified of all dogs. I'm that person that would jump in front of a car to avoid a dog - big or small. Growing up I wasn't around dogs, and thus they make me kind of nervous. Maybe they lady wasn't breedist, just uncomfortable. Just a possibility. :)  




 I deleted my Facebook awhile ago and traded it in for linkedin. I'm connected to people still and in a much more useful way.  




 If I recall correctly, it ended when he went off to college.  









 Did that when I moved into my first apartment. Luckily the maintenance man was a genius and prepared for all the idiot college kids moving in and had his truck loaded with towels and some magical spray that more or less killed the soap bubbles.  




 One of my best experiences was at Wendy's. There was an older gentleman working and I asked if it were possible to have a sandwich with no meat. Many times I've been charged full price for a meatless sandwich. This guy went out of his way to get me a deal. Punched in the items individually and put it on a Jr sized bun, was about 70 cents and I think I had cheese on it as well.  




 Books.

I have a thing about owning the books I read, so I hardly go to the library. I have a favorite used bookstore I frequently visit and if I have the intention of purchasing 1 specific book, I leave with at least 2 others.

When I buy a house, first thing I'll do is convert an entire room into a library. So at least my hoarding will be in a central location?  




 I'm paying my own way through college. I'm a full time student and I work 35-40 hours a week. If I had the option to have my parents pay for my school, I'd accept in a heartbeat.

For the most part I'm indifferent to people who have parents that pay for their college. I've met a lot of different people in school, some that have their school paid for through loans, through scholarships, by working, or from their parents. How someone pays for school doesn't define them though. A good friend, coworkers, etc. wouldn't change how they think of you because of this.

The only time I've had any issues with someone who has parents paying for their school, is when they act spoiled about it.

As long as you don't walk around bragging about it, it's nothing to be ashamed of. 

TL;DR
I think they are pretty damn lucky.  




 I'm assuming you use a wood burning tool and then just spray it with clear polyurethane and it stays nice? Will it ever rot or should it last forever (or a lifetime)?  




 Did you text the number?  




 Thought I had it figured out, texted the number and apparently I'm not as good at math as I thought I was. Trying to figure out where I went wrong. :/  




 Maybe I'm reading this wrong, but were you the one to find your mother and discover she had died? As a five year old that must have been pretty traumatic and could have played a roll in not having you attend the funeral.  




 Glad it turned out alright! :)  




 I'm not an ASL major or minor, but took ASL 101 for kicks and giggles, and really enjoyed it. Had Kevin and he is awesome. I need a few more credits before I graduate in May and decided to take ASL 100 with him because I enjoyed his class so much.  




 As a broke college kid, I love Christmas for the same reason. That and small used book stores. I saw some people recommended going to the library, but there is something about having books of your own that feels so good.  




 Sometimes people cave. It's a personal choice. My family made prime rib for dinner last night. My older brother made it (an amazing cook) and it took so much will power not to eat any. Every side dish was vegetarian though, so that helped. 

I've caved, I know I'm new to this whole thing, and I accept I'll slip up sometimes. My reasons for being pescatarian aren't moral reasons, so if I slip and eat meat I just start over and try again. 

Tell your fiance you love him, but were really hungry and what you eat is your decision. :) 




 I'm sorry, that puts a damper on the holidays. Hope you have a merry Christmas and enjoy the time with your family despite grandma trying to trick you. :)  




 I've taken my own food with me places. All summer I kept vegetarian canned soup/pasta and microwaveable vegetarian items in my car because I never knew where I'd be when I was hungry and didn't want to burden the person I was dating with having to feed me. When I go to bbqs I always bring my own veggie burgers. I never expect someone to make accomidations for me, but appreciate it when they do. However I didn't grow up vegetarian and made this change after I had moved out on my own. When people order pizza, they generally get half a pizza with what I want on it. I'd suggest talking to your fiance's family and asking about being more vegetarian friendly. Maybe they don't understand it or don't know what to make. 
























 I'm graduating and leaving town, or I'd say I'd go. Are you working or taking classes over the summer? If so, you could ask coworkers or classmates to go. Make a few new friends :) 




 Shaving legs in the sink is doable, just not ideal. I'll try switching the water tomorrow when I shave to see if that helps. 

I have not used pre shave oil. 
 
I'm not use to having to pull my skin so it is stretched, so I'm probably not doing it 100% the way it should be.

Update: using the lower faucet helped with the lather. Ended up knicking my underarm - trying to hold the razor, pull the skin, and shave with basically one hand is harder than anticipated.   




 None!? 




 Buy a tube or raft to go tubing down the river. Best free (aside from initial investment of tube and any alcohol you bring) thing to do on a hot summer day. 

This isn't on campus, but it is a fun thing to do during the summer in Mt. Pleasant.  




 I just started using DE razor and I use it in the shower, takes a bit longer but I think that's just because I'm still learning.  




 With the lather I think I just used too much water. I shave in the shower and it was easy to dilute the soap too much. 

Yes they were problem areas I had before. Issues with razor burn and irritation. 

Oh and I attempted to shave my underarms and I'm having trouble getting as close of a shave there, legs are much easier.  




 My list of things to try is expanding quickly, but I'll definitely add that to my list :)  




 I picked up some of that soap and I noticed a huge difference. :)  




 I bought some new soap and it definitely made a difference. I don't quite have the lather down. There are a couple areas that I'm having trouble getting a close shave with though. I still haven't cut myself yet, but I'm terrified of the day I do.  




 Try looking on Amazon. Also they are better if you leave them out and they get a little stale. 

Edit: After a quick search on my phone, it looks like peeps don't ship outside the US. Not sure on shipping regulations from the US to Australia, but you might be able to have someone personally ship you some. 




 I've lurked here awhile and did research on other threads and found Astra mentioned quite a bit my newcomers, so it seemed like the safe and logical choice to begin. Can I get Taylor of Old Bond Street cream in a store, or is it online only? Thank you! I stumbled across you guys a few months ago, and instantly became interested. I already can't wait for my leg hair to grow back so I can give it another go. :) 




 No worries, I'm posting in a man dominated subreddit. And this is the first time I've posted something and outted myself as female. So I would have assumed I was male as well. 

Thanks for the thought out reply! I'm nervous to try feathers because I've heard they are good, but also easy to cut yourself with. So far I like Astras, but I'm excited to see what else is out there and what works best for me. :)  




 Thanks! I tried to pay as much attention to what I was doing and what did or didn't seem to work. I had noise to a minimal so I could listen to how it sounded as I shaved. If I get razor burn in an area, how should I treat it differently the next time?


Edit: I actually don't have any hair on my face. I used the razor to shave my legs last night and this morning I used it on my underarms.  




 Thank you! I am in the US, I'll be sure to stop by Walgreens and pick some up to try. :)  




 First shave was pretty successful! Didn't get quite as close of a shave as I was hoping for, but didn't cut myself either. I'm sure with practice I'll get better. :)  




 Do you have a favorite? I purchased the razor, blades, and brush one at a time as I had the money, but I was impatient and just bought the soap I could find at Walmart.  




 I hadn't used it before and didn't realize until after I tried lathering that it wouldn't work. :(  









 As someone who digs through applications and hires new employees, if I had to do this it would take up my entire day. I get so many applications where I work, I can't even look at every single one. If you care enough about getting the job, give the company a call to check on your application, but don't be a pest about it.  




 I love your tagging system. I always buy books faster than I can read them, and then some get lost in the shuffle until months later I realize I still haven't read them. I may have to steal this idea. :)  




 There are several women over at /r/wicked_edge that have found a better way to shave.  




 Thanks! I'll try those. :)  




 I apologize for the misunderstanding. :)  




 I've been wanting to pick up drinking scotch. Do you have any recommendations on where to start? 




 You have too much good beer in VT to not keep trying. Here's a pointer to enjoying beer, I've found that when I pour the beer into a mug, it tastes better than in the bottle. Pour the beer just right so you get a bit of a head on top. Also, there is a wide variety of beers. If you don't like the taste of an IPA, you may enjoy a Porter more. Where I'm from, there are some stores that sell create-your-own six packs. I recommend finding one of those, and purchasing six completely different styles of beer. Try each one (not all the same night) so that you can see which ones you prefer. Keep note of what you do or don't like, and then you can ask for beers with similar tastes. 




 I love me a good beer. I'm currently visiting VT and there are some really good local beers I've stumbled across, but I still love me a pint of PBR on occasion. Everyone likes to bash it, but I think it's a good beer in it's own way.  




 That is extremely helpful. Thank you!  




 What's the best way to clean it? I've read a lot of people do a vinegar and water mix, is that a 1:1 ratio? Do you have any recommendations for blades?  
























 Bought this razor on a whim without knowing what type it was, after searching online I've found that it is a gillette slim made in 1966. I did a quick clean up just to make sure it twisted and turned in all the ways it should, and everything looks good.

Currently I use a schick krona (which I really like), but I've noticed that the gillette slim is a bit heavier and has a shorter handle. My little sister has shown interest in DE and I want to give her a starter kit for Christmas. Would the shorter handle and the heavier razor be okay for a female beginner? Or should I keep looking for something with a longer handle and lighter weight? 









 You absolutely can profit from working on the island. It's all about knowing how to budget and save - same as any job anywhere. The Jamaicans were some of the hardest working people and mostly friendly. 

Source: worked on the island the past six months and brought home a good chunk of change.  




 If by garbage trucks you mean horse drawn vehicles. 




 The test is very much flawed. I only took one year of Spanish in high school and wasn't very good at it. The test placed me in 202 and I ended up dropping down to 102 and not receiving retroactive credit because I choose to take a course below what I tested into.  




 That's awesome, can you use other fruits aside from apples? Thanks so much, I'll have to try this.  




 Thanks :) 




 How do you know how much to use? I put some of the peels in my apple butter.  




 Make it very similarly to apple sauce, but you cook it longer and make it a smoother texture, comparable to an apple jam or apple spread.  




 I worked with a Welsh girl, a Scottish girl, and an English boy this summer in America, they all sounded completely different. Although if I met someone from the UK I'm not sure I could pinpoint where they were from. 

 




 Awesome! Thanks for the response. I'll probably crack one open later today anyways, just wanted to make sure there wasn't anything else I should look for.  




 Everything on the outside looks like it worked, do I need to open one to make sure it is good on the inside?  









 I saw that as well. I think for now I'll just use something cheap since I won't be actually using the pot to cook in, just for the final canning process. Thank you! 




 Dated a kid named Sean for almost four years, called him Seen the entire time. First time because I thought was how it was pronounced, after that it just became a pet name. 




 Currently work at a coffee shop and I say the same thing, it amazes me how confused people look when they try to figure out how to put cream and sugar in their coffee.  




 I would have looked at a thrift store first if I could, I love them and they are my go to - especially for cooking things. However, as I mentioned in an earlier comment, I am currently living in a place with limited resources. No thrift store, no big chains, basically I need to order it online. I did find someone that is willing to let me borrow a stock pot of theirs though! So for now I'm doing that, but first chance I get I want to get my own. 




 Thanks! 




 Only reason I was looking for stainless steel instead of aluminum is because you can't cook acidic things in it. 

For the actually canning process, there is no difference in what container you use then? As long as it covers the jars and you can heat it on the stove?

I'm in the process of getting a book :) I'm currently living somewhere with extremely limited resources, so I've been relying on friends, family, and internet advice. 

I've been told to start with something easy the first time I can, does it really matter seeing as how I'll still have to go through the same canning steps? My plan is to make apple butter this week and can that as my first item.

Thanks again for all your help! 




 I am new to canning and am in the process of gathering all the equipment I will need. I've ordered [http://www.amazon.com/Norpro-6-Piece-Canning-Set/dp/B0000DDVMH/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8qid=1381440440sr=8-1keywords=canning+tools] and I've ordered a rack for the bottom of the pot, however I still need a pot. I have a flat stove top so I want to avoid the granite ones. I started looking at stainless steel stockpots and found this one [(http://www.amazon.com/Alpha-Heavy-Stainless-Steel-Savezoneusa/dp/B002GE5GYI/ref=cm_cr_dp_asin_lnk)]. I've heard good things about it, but is it really necessary to spend 60 dollars on a pot. Does anyone have any other suggestions of good ones that maybe are a bit cheaper? Thank you! 




 These look amazing Nolan! 




 Could you post the list of books you received?  




 Has a book been choosen? I'd love to participate.  




 I'm in the act too old group. :/ 




 That's why I loved hoodies in high school. But then they made it against the dress code to wear them. :/ 




 Applying for everything isn't wrong. I'm completely white, and applied for a scholarship my senior year of high school that was supposed to be given to an African American female that played sports and had a good gpa. I was a perfect candidate for the scholarship, except for the whole being white issue. My principal, who was black, told me to apply anyway because the foundation rather give money to someone than no one and hardly anyone applied for this scholarship. I ended up being one of the people who received the scholarship. I was honest on my scholarship application and checked the box saying I was white. I know this doesn't explain why it isn't racist, but several other people in this thread did a good job of that already. Just wanted to encourage you to apply to any and all scholarships, it isn't wrong and you might get lucky. :) 




 Made a world of difference! :)  




 I just shaved my underarm again and I tried more passes in different directions, this seemed to help, but I'm still not 100% satisfied with it yet. I keep trying to shave the way I used to with my old razor, but that isn't right.

Yes the lather helped with my legs. I ended up doing two passes against the grain. I've tried and tried to go with the grain, but it is the most awkward thing to shave away from my body.  
























 When I worked in a bakery, we always used a water bath and baked them between 250-300F. Never had any problems with cracking.   




 I'm 24(f) dating someone 36(m). Nothing wrong with it. Two consenting adults dating is a very normal thing.   




 I've been a coffee drinker for awhile,  but am just starting to really get into coffee. I have a Chemex pour over that I enjoy, but still purchase ground coffee from local coffee shops. I saw on the wiki page that Hario was mentioned as a good under 50 grinder. I received the Hario MM2 http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B004QWMAII/ref=mp_s_a_1_4?qid=1419718375sr=8-4pi=AC_SX110_SY165_QL70 for Christmas.  Will this work for a pour over,  or should I exchange it? Thanks! 




 Received a Kindle Fire HDX for Christmas from my parents....I can't change the background because it has ads.  




 He won't let us go to bed without one last kiss right before falling asleep. And first thing in the morning I kiss him.  I love that we start and end each day with a kiss.  




 Lady shaver here.  When I first started I did short strokes and took it slow,  especially around my knees and ankles. But now I find that I can get a good shave with just 1 pass ATG on my legs. I do one long stroke to shave the length of my lower leg, and one long stroke to shave my thighs. I still tend to do short strokes on my knees because I have a tendency to cut myself there. I love my razor and I'll never go back. I've never had as close of a shave as I do now.  




 How does this shit work? Are regular Starbucks employees expected to perform cream art in peoples drinks? Is this difficult? I don't get it. Seems like a huge pain in the ass, day in-day out. Even if this is an indie place or something, do you charge more because goons expect you to draw shit in their coffee drinks?

I worked at an independent coffee shop for a while and started teaching myself how to do latte art. It isn't difficult, just takes time and practice. We weren't required to do it, but did it because it was fun, competitive with other baristas, and made the work day more interesting. Most customers don't expect it, but it's great to see the smile and surprise on their face when you hand their coffee to them. No extra charge.  It doesn't really take any extra time. You need to pour the milk into the espresso anyway, why not do it in a fun way. :) 




 Wow. Someone seems to have a stick up their ass. The food industry isn't for everyone, and obviously you aren't cut out for it. Some of us do enjoy the long days and take pride in what we do. Some culinary schools are a waste and some are actually really good. It's amazing networking, it gets you in a kitchen cooking faster than working up from a dishwasher to a chef, and you can be introduced to so many more techniques and varieties of foods than working in a restaurant because you aren't limited to just the theme of the food at the restaurant. 




 Love that you're watching Gilmore Girls. 




 Same. I get that it sucks to have someone steal your clothing, so I always return hoodies, hats, etc. Typically the guy is so surprised that I'm willing to give it back that he gives me one for keeps. I now have a shelf full of basketball shorts, tshirts, hoodies, and hats that are from exes.  I don't tend to wear them unless it's a sports team or something that I'm into. 




 That's how I love mine. I put them in a crock pot with some butter, mustard,  and some seasonings.  Let it cook on low for a few hours. They are nice and tender but not mushy. So good!  




 Mod Podge is typically a waste of money.  Use liquid Elmer white glue and water. Do a 2:1 ratio.  Mix well. Several art students and craft store employees have encourage people to use this cheaper method that works just as well. 




 My first DE razor was a schick krona and I loved it. I just bought my little sister a Parker 29L for Christmas and although she hasn't received it yet, it does have a nice long handle that gives a good grip.  




 Awesome!  




 Fair enough.  




 Nice. I've been keeping my eyes out at garage sales and estate sales too, just in case there is anything good. 




 I've seen a range of prices. At this same shop they had a gold razor that looked like a double edge, but only had one edge to it and had little comb things sticking out - it was about $20. They also had some travel ones with a case and other little things in it, but were upwards of $30 so I passed on those. 




 Thanks! It's the second razor I've purchased. Both have been at antique stores. Unless I'm specifically looking to purchase a certain razor, I'll probably just continue purchasing randoms at antique stores and other resale shops. Seems to be the places to get the best deals :) 




 I used a toothbrush and some soap to do the initial clean, some scrubbing bubbles, and then rubbing alcohol to kill anything that was left.   




 It adjusts the blade so you can get a more or less aggressive shave. 




 If you don't mind me asking, what settings do you use? 




 Looks like I'll have to play around with it :) 




 Female here who doesn't shave her face. I'm assuming same thing goes for legs and such. :) 




 Thanks!  




 Will do! Thanks :) 




 Awesome advice! Thank you :) 




 Thanks :) 




 Thanks! 

I've never used a razor with adjustable settings. Where is a good starting point?
