 Best bit of advice my parents have ever taught me was to "just ask", the worst they can say is "no" (I know thats not the worst but that was the general principle) 
I've had this attitude since and its handy, its given me the confidence to approach new employers.. girlfriends.. 




 Confidence to follow through with my plans. 




 try "I'm really confused by this assignment, how about you?" or "Hi, can I borrow a pen? I'm useless at being prepared...." or something along them lines. Then follow it up with "How long have you been in this class for? I've never seen you before?"

 I still haven't seen anything on the London Riots, I would love to see a film from both the viewpoint of a Rioter   A Policeman. 




 If you haven't seen it yet, check out ["Hitler: The rise of Evil"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346293/) with Hiter being played by one of my favourite actors, Robert Carlyle. It follows Hitler from childhood right up to the early stages of WW2. 




 Thats fantastic 
























 Great, advice thanks! The SIPPS combined with ISA sounds about what I'm looking for, unfortunately I'm currently in central London so it will be a long time until the house deposit is sorted!  




 Hi all, I've only recently started to think about what my options are, I'm 22 but I figured the sooner you get started the easier it is in the long run right? 

I've already started purchasing premium bonds and have an ISA that I contribute to every month, but I'm confused as to what are the best (flexible) options out there which have a reasonably high gain.

I guess Ideally I'm looking for something I can transfer money too every month and be quite secure. Any help? 




 Just checked out Realplayer for the first time in years, its actually got a lot going for it, especially compared to QT pro X
