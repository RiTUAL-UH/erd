 My vitals are good, no one's freaking out about how thin I am and forcing me in heavy clothing anymore..yet I'm still expected to gain *more*.

I know a BMI of 15 isn't healthy, but any further up, not being able to feel certain bones I'm likely to become depressed and maybe throw myself off a bridge. Don't worry, that's not a real suicide threat, I'm too wimpy and don't know any bridges.

I don't even get to be one of those Instagrammers who get motivation from other recoverers due to circumstances. *I. Have. Nothing.*

I wish this would've never happened, I wish I was still me instead of a beast that wants to destroy every bit of himself.

 
























 For someone's TDEE to be 1200 is a very rare occurrence.

[This calculator](http://iifym.com/tdee-calculator/) says your TDEE is 1,422 calories a day. [This one](http://scoobysworkshop.com/calorie-calculator/) says 1,525. Your dietitian knows what she's talking about, ~~unlike mine who seems to only want me to suffer~~.

 
























 I'm going to admit the bold "fuck off" in this post startled me at first.

I *know* I have more to live for then this, but if I'm functioning just fine right now... 
























 Ensure made my teeth turn all dark and stained and then when I complained about it she said they were simply rotting due to my condition.

Went to my dentist, nope, they're just stained, and they were pissed off the dietitian hadn't said anything about possible staining.

Oh, and she tried to push me to 3,000 calories through the tube. I would have to be hooked up to it for *20 hours* at that amount. Not only did she want to make me hate myself, she wanted to take any form of a life I had at that point. 
























 Ah, you're also a young one. Shame we've been hit with this so young, right?

My heart rate was in the low 40s as I slept when I was admitted, the food also sucked at mine and I had a mental breakdown at the idea of having 'snacks'. (Though that was mainly because I couldn't hold anything down - still can't, in fact - and felt like I'd be spending 24/7 vomiting or trying to hold back vomit.)

I didn't have to be helped to the bathroom but my dad had to be with me while I showered. And I was supposed to sit in the shower but lol, that wasn't happening. 
























 **The Good**

Leave for my 'evaluation' this week.

**The Bad**

Downloaded that *Zombies, Run!* app and tried to run obsessively even though my body can't handle it at my severely underweight BMI. How am I ever going to get to do cross country like I always wanted to do in high school? *sigh*

**The Ugly**

I still have no hobbies except for goofing off of the Internet and crying. Can't even stop long enough to watch anime. But I'll be on a road trip tomorrow so I'll try and force myself to unplug and read my massive pile of library books.
