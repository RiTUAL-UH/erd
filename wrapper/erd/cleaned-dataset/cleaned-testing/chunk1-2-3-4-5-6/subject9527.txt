 Why would anyone want this film dedicated to them?

why did they keep doing the same "I'm about to walk out of the room oh shit i made a noise" trick 12 times?

So this baby stayed in the cabinet all night and part of the day and NEVER made a sound? Does no one go to bathrooms in bus stations? I've been to bathrooms in bus stations and it's like a urine donation center where they pay 5 dollars for a half gallon of your pee. 

If Michael Myers house is curse why did someone sell it to a new family? Who are these people? Why do they keep a shit broke down car on the lawn? Do they want it to look like a halloween house? The dad said he doesn't like halloween.

Why is the mom so naive? Like her kid keeps running away from her. Can't she see that this kid is a lost cause? He probably wants to get offed. 

What does the annoying blonde kid everyone hated have to do with Michael Myers? He's not blood releated. They don't make mention of this shit other than saying that he gets nightmares. But the baby is related to Michael Myers. What the fuck is this mythology?

What did the legion of the tipped hat do to get Michael Myers to have a kid? Did someone jerk off Michael Myers? Is Michael Myers a horny guy? Because he doesn't give any signs of it. 

Why does the legion of the tipped hat seem in cahootz with Michael Myers, but at the end Mr. Myers kills them? What was the point of them anyways? They were fufilling some half assed made up prophecy that i'm still not sure what the goal was, but they don't make sense.

What's the green goo? This addition made no sense. Why is there green goo? There's one insert shot of a bunch of letters. Is this Green Goo concentrated letters? Did scientists discover the alphabet is real? Why has this not been shared with the world? People would love to see real life letters. Sesame Street would be so cool.

Why is Michael Myers so fucking overpowered? I get he's a cereal killer, but this guy has fucking transportation power, but he can only walk. This makes no sense. How did he get these powers? Isn't Michael Myers just some large ass idiot with a high pain tolerance and a killer streak? Why is this not enough? Why does he need to be Halloween Goku? 

Why is Paul Rudd in this movie? I don't get his presence. He puts these family idiots in more peril second only to the main lady who's just a danger to herself. What's so important about the teenage kid? He's annoying. Let him go.

Why is this called the curse of michael myers? Michael Myers is just a dumb killing idiot machine. The curse is by the cult of the tipped hat. What does this have to do with ancient letters? Those letters never appear again after they are mentioned. 

Why even bother making number 6 if you don't have a script? This shit made no sense. Why does the lady not just drive till she runs out of gas back to town? Why did she stop at the bus station?  


































 I tried everything to get him to watch anything other than the 8 or 9 Marvel movies. I tried breaking his arms, I tried showing him other movies where I edited the Marvel logo in to trick him into thinking that MArvel produces Orson Wells and Carol Reed movies, I even tried to take him to a hypnotherapist to get him to see that Marvel movies aren't the best thing ever made. It turns out my son is leaving with my DVD of Batttman Vs Superman. Should I be worried? He said he wants to fornicate passionatly with the DVD and that there's nothing wrong with a relationship between a DVD and himself. 

My son has also decided to sexually identify as a DVD player and I told him you can't do that because it's all about imax and blu ray 8k you'd be behind the times and I'd have to disown you can't you idenify as a blu ray player at the least or a pc and he said no because he likes consols better and I said I have to disown you son. I don't know what to do. Is Battman captain of the Marvel team? I just can't figure a way to get to my son fifi. 









 Why are there no subtitles for Eddie Redmayne. He speaks like he's trying not to get caught pissing off in church.

Does NO ONE live in Chicago? I get the whole "we got alien CGI artists who can fix this to hide our presence" but during that whole dogfight apparently only three people live in the city. 

Why bees? How did this not get established in the prolouge?

Why is Eddie Abraxis so careful to not kill other human beings sometimes but sends his goons to kill three guys just ramblin' around a Chicago bridge? This dudes track record seems inconsistent. 

Why did Queen Kunis know about the telescope, exact make and model of the one stolen from the house in the beginning, was being sold on ebay? Her mom didn't tell her this stuff, or at least it's not established. 

Why did Channing Tatum break character when Mila Kunis offered to dress his wound with a tampon? 

Why is Mila Kunis in this movie? Why does everyone look like they are from Farscape? Is this a Farscape movie?

Why does Mila Kunis' cousin keep saying "Only English?" Does he know he's in a movie? Are CGI subtitles expensive? 

Why is there a romantic comedy in the middle of a space opera? I feel like Tim Gunn would feel these clash and would be poking at this movie saying "MAKE IT WORK."

How did Channing Tatum Master Chief that ship shirtless, in space, and without a suit? Only Master Chief can travel in a slipspace rupture outside of a ship. 














 Best prequel to Insidious possible. Was great to learn Lin Shaye's origin as a evangelical fighting against the Knights in Satan's Service. The camera work was also pretty awesome. Lots of movement, not a static shot in the whole movie.  




 Why does this guy make 3 mustache jokes within the first six minutes of the movie? Is this his thing? Is the mustache Mortdecai?

 














 What are these levels for creatures? Why mention that they have levels if you're not going to mention them again?

Why did Ben Barnes love interest admit everything villainous she's doing to Barnes' face and the dude didn't go, "Wait wut you're spying on us?"

Why did Jeff Bridges sound like he had fallen and had not been able to get up for such a long time?

If Ben Barnes is a witch why doesn't he have cool powers like everyone else? Is he a big dud witch? 

Why did Antje Traute sound like she was phonetically reading her lines off a cue card? I know she can speak fluently.

Why was Ben Barnes dad such a push over and what happened to the pig catching Barnes was supposed to do? They're in a small fenced area, how hard is it to catch one?

Does that big Ogre man have like super fast legs because he moves slow as fuck but he manages to find these dudes where ever they are in no time?

What's the deal with Pendle mountain? Is it a mountain? It doesn't seem like anyone has trouble finding Mother Malkin's hideout. It doesn't even seem like it takes long to get there at all? Can Pendle Mountain really be a mountain or a hill?

Why is [Marco Beltrami's music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EDhvQzcSes) better than anything in Seventh Son?

Why does Dijon Honeysue seem so overpowered and smart for the first hour and a half, but then turns into a big dolt in the final fight? 

Why did Malkin think there was going to be a sequel?

EDIT: Since making this post I have some additional questions.

Why is this not a Marvel movie? 

Why does Mother Malkin need that gumball crackerjack toy neckless when she and her crew are already ridiculously over powered?

Jeff Bridges has one week to train Ben Barnes, but this dude Barnes seems like he's pretty much a boss with fighting shit? What's the point of training? 

Why did JEff Bridges keep a demonic knight in his house if he knew that that shit would be dangerous?

Why is this movie so geographically fucked? I mean it looks like this shit has vast expanses between shit, but they seem to get everywhere really quickly? Do these dudes got nike j's or some shit?

And on the journey, they got one week, but it seems like they go past one week? Why one week? Mother Malkin seems like did a fine job without one week to fuck up shit? Why is Jeff Bridges so bad at his job?

What is Mother Malkin's skill set? Why does she have some sort of power to do interior decorating? Where do you get that power with all that shit?

 Shameful display.  This article ignores key facts in order to push a preselected narrative.

1) Pao was not subjected to any particular vitriol on being declared interim CEO, nor until after she began implementing questionable and unpopular policies --- such as banning fat-shaming forums while leaving far more foul content entirely alone.  Even geek-famous fat people (Such as Boogie, a popular Youtube commentator) spoke up against this ham-handedness (and you will be hard-pressed to find anyone on the Internet nicer than Boogie).

2) Pao clearly did not care about the racist/sexist slander, and good on her for that.  No matter how justified one might think they were, that is not how mature and intelligent people handle outrage.  Then again, when tens of thousands gather to burn the President in effigy while screaming approval, mocking his intellect, gender and skin color, we call that a public protest and ask the Administration what they did wrong.  (Note: I'm referencing anti-war protests against Bush)

3) The petition is what gained traction in the press, and it is clearly what Pao is resigning over, BECAUSE it got traction in the press and brought attention to her actions.

Your article is smearing over that with faux outrage --- and I notice that your co-author on the piece also references two of his own previous NYT articles about Pao's legal issues as another way to deflect all of this criticism.

The NYT should not be soapboxing for corporate officers they happen to like.  It's as shameful as when one of your Pulitzer-winners recently tied "Bronies" to accused mass-murderer Dylann Roof merely on basis of a photoshopped t-shirt she had no time (or interest) in verifying before publishing reference to.

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3cur16/im_mike_isaac_the_new_york_times_reporter/csz9s6t 









 Look, I know exactly what you're doing.

You're trying to conclude that Pao was the victim of sexism because people used language like "cunt" or some other insult; your reasoning being that the slur has some reference to "gender" attached to it, therefore, she is being insulted based on her gender.

This doesn't follow nor does it examine the motivations for why someone would begin to insult her.  Do you really, really think people insulted Pao merely for being a woman?  Then you really do need to explain why people stuck up for Victoria.  Are you going to invent something about how people only defended Victoria to give themselves the appearance of caring about a woman?  That's about as uncharitable as you can be, but at this point, going through your history, I don't think you're here to engage with facts or truly analyze why people felt the way they do but to try to go quote farming for your next big "thinkpiece."  The reaction to Victoria being fired is direct contradiction to the story that redditors, etc, are just trying to drive women off the website, or wherever--and all you just did was handwave it away.  Doesn't fit the story?  Then don't include it.  Journalism at its finest.  Why not claim Victoria was let go out of some gender narrative?  It's just as baseless as the other shit you're trying to claim, but that won't stop you.

I'd suggest you don't understand the sarcastic, caustic, and sardonic nature of internet culture where people will say all sorts of offensive things (even racist or, yes, sexist) despite the motivation being different, but I honestly don't think you're that dim and you're doing this out of an ideological basis to give your personal pet issues more advertisement and try to claim they're really the issue you say they are, blah blah blah.  So let's take this about another character that was unpopular; nobody likes or liked George W. Bush, and everyone made comments about how he looked like a chimp; do you really think people bashed him solely because he looks like a chimp?  No, he was bashed because of his policies and other reasons.  People insulted Michael Moore's weight not because he was fat, but because they were motivated by contrary politics or perceptions of his honesty. This hive of bees doesn't care what gender is sticking its hand in the hive; it'll sting flesh regardless of who it's attached to.

You're going to write up a piece referencing sexism and racism on the internet, removed entirely from the context of the conversation, claim "Chairman Pao" references are motivated solely by racist intent and that her being called a "bitch" is because she's a woman above all else.  You're going to slant this, mislead, and then pat yourself on the back for this bit of "activism."

Nobody gives a flying fuck what Pao's gender is.  Are you this big of an idiot where you think there's some widepread male supremacy movement on the internet?  Go on, prove it, then.  And don't use your feelings or humanities crap, use actual social science.  People here are more concerned with reddit generally keeping a hands-off approach to its communities and not favoring any political perspective (even refusing to censor the most vile ones) than the personal identities and the lives of the admins.

So let's drop all the pretenses.  You know you're being dishonest and you're full of shit, trying to drum up attention to pet causes.  Obviously, we know it too.  So what is your goal here?  It's to try to influence the uninformed, propaganda style, to try to get support for your politics  And you're a piece of shit for trying to play that kind of game.

And I'm not going to be polite to you about this either.  Because this entire show of you being "polite" or professional while you farm for vitriol for your next write-up is just to give yourself an air of professionality and respectability you don't deserve, and to give the impression you're trying to give people a fair shake when your conclusions were predestined.  When you're surrounded by your colleagues, drunk late and night in a bar chatting about work, I'm sure the discussion is much, much different.

 Without meaning to sound condescending, I really think you should endeavour to excavate a little deeper into the mineshaft of cinema. Dumb action-flicks and superhero films are the common metals near the top of the mineshaft. They're completely accessible: everybody 'gets' them. You don't have to do much work to get the shallow sort of no-frills 'entertainment' they provide.

However, something which most teenagers are not yet aware of, is that down there in the mineshaft is a wealth of precious gems so beautiful and so thought-provoking that if you experienced them, you would never want to go back to the rather common and mundane stuff on the surface. Down there are films that can make you cry and leave you in a state of heightened emotion for days. Down there are films that can change your perspective of how you view your own life, or how you view other people. Down there are films that will worm their way into your brain and start to become a part of your identity.

But you can't just leap down the mineshaft. If your diet consists of Transformers, Harry Potters and Avengers, you will break your neck if you try to dive straight for the Blade Runners and the American Beautys. Challenge yourself to dig downwards. Watch films from as many different genres, time-periods and cultures as you can. Try to inch away from your comfort zone. 

Again: please don't think me as being condescending. This isn't an intelligence thing. People who appreciate the "depressing philosophical bullshit" of films like Birdman aren't more intelligent than you. They've just put more time into exploring cinema and adventuring into their own personal mineshaft. I know it seems comfortable at the top, but I can promise you that digging is very, *very* worth your time.

**Dmitri Shostakovich, 1906-1975**

**String Quartet No. 3, F major, Op. 73, 1946**

Just after World War II, Shostakovich, then forty, turned once again from his public orchestral music to his private chamber music, composing his String Quartet No. 3 in F major, Op. 73. While he had already written nine symphonies, Shostakovich was just settling into his emerging series of string quartets that would eventually comprise fifteen quartets written throughout his mature life, including some of his very last compositions. Many feel that the String Quartet No. 3 is among is his best quartets; it was a favorite of the composer himself.

It shows Shostakovich in his full powers as a chamber music composer, skillfully deploying the string quartet to express his utterly distinctive musical personality. From a technical standpoint, the quartet, like many of his later quartets, features an astonishing range of textures, sonic effects and brilliant part writing in the service of music with startling emotional and psychological impact. Successful as abstract musical expression on the one hand, it is nearly impossible to miss the topical and programmatic nature of the quartet, another aspect common to most of Shostakovich's chamber music.

The unspeakable hardships of life in the Soviet Union up through the end of WWII took their toll on Shostakovich: nervous, bitter and depressed, he found his most profound outlet in the safe privacy and intimate expressive capability of chamber music. String Quartet No. 3 is a particularly powerful example.

Of all the nearly forgotten music by Mendelssohn, the most nearly completely forgotten is his music for chorus. Only his songs come close to being as almost entirely ignored, but because a few of them have earned a place in the recital hall, even they have a more prominent place in the repertoire. This 10-disc Brilliant set of Mendelssohn's complete choral works featuring the Chamber Choir of Europe under Nicol Matt addresses this problem even though it may not solve it. The performances are uniformly excellent. The Choir has a smooth tone and superb diction and Matt elicits from them polished balanced and ardent interpretations. Despite the dearth of comparisons, these performances with their clean textures, light tempos, and devout tone are surely as close to definitive as is possible to imagine. For some listeners, of course, this may not be enough to redeem Mendelssohn's heartfelt yet stolid music from obscurity. For others with more open minds, however, this set may serve to introduce a body of sacred works that certainly exceeds any other similar body of works from the same period in terms of skill and sincerity. Though a bit recessed, Brilliant's digital sound is cool and clear.

 Pizar! 




 Now, it's been quite some time since I've last scene the original Kevin Bacon movie about a guy who fights a town with roundhouse dance movies, but watching the remake I noticed something suspicious. Mainly the central romance between Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough is less authentic than the real one between Miles Teller and Kenny Wormald.

If you're not familiar with the remake of Footloose it came out to the acclaim of no one and was promptly forgotten amongst the shit heap shores of remake island with Total Recall and Straw Dogs. It's the same story except Craig Brewer, the director of Black Snake Moan and that shit where Terrence Howard pretends to play a big boy not on the verge of tears and raps and shit, does something I really don't remember in the original film.

I started getting my suspicions when the introductory scenes between Ren Mackormick (Wormald) and Willard Hewitt (Miles Teller) had this strange air of sexual tension. For instance, Willard and Ren sit down for school lunch and Ren begins to tell Willard of his worldly travels. It's here where all my experience reading erotic novels from Anne Rice and Henry Miller have paid off because Willard starts asking Ren to finish the story of the night Ren went out with two Russian women and had them as his sexual conquests.

Why does Willard want to know this? Especially after they just met. When Willard finds out Ren's story is false he's disappointed like he had a bunch of armed thugs rob his spank bank of Ren Mackormick related erotic fantasies. 

It only gets weirder from here because every interaction with Julianne Hough is dry and unromantic. He's basically trying to save this psycho girl from trying to kill herself, she attempts to play chicken with a train (like she was gonna win...sorry you don't have roundhouse kicks, Hough) and she's under the impression this means Ren loves her when Ren's true love really lies with Willard. 

As the movie goes on Ren learns that Willard can't dance and that in order to challenge the city counsel on the ordinance to make dancing illegal they must have a tete a tete at a car wash where Willard and Ren talk about wet t-shirt contests. But then promptly Ren douses Willard with the car wash hose. When this happens Willard runs around to Ren and they begin wrestling. Perhaps if Craig Brewer had trained his camera a little longer on this scene Ren would have tripped on the water line and Willard would have fallen on top of him. They would have realized that they are in love and embrace each other in chaste french kisses as the music swells and they go off to city to live a bohemian life style. Ren would become a steel worker and Willard a starving artist painting nudes of Zebras and rats with large phallus's on their heads.  

But no. Brewer denies us this possibility for more cock teasing and more audience approved heterosexual mating with Julianne Hough, Now a note on Julianne Hough. Hough is amazing looking.  She really nails the part of playing a down home southern preachers daughter rebelling against her father but she also wears small shorts and this is distracting because it's like on some level Brewer knows he accidentally directed Brokeback Footloose, but ended up having to save face by adding this eye candy. 

Either way, we then have to sit through tedious montages of Willard learning to dance, and it's in the key scene where Willard dances with Ren's nieces in a line dance rendition of "Let's Hear it for the Boys" that really seals the deal because in between the already extremely homosexual undertones of that scene, Brewer adds inserts of Willard and Ren learning to dance in Ren's garage just as the sun falls down. Ren is teaching Willard to "fist-pump" and it looks as if they are holding each other in a masculine version of a ballroom waltz. But this repeats the formula of the car wash scene in which Brewer has the realization that he made Priscilla, Queen of the Footloose Dancefloor and cuts too soon out of shame. 

The movie marches onto the finish, shit resolves and that's how I learned the remake of Footloose is a great movie about two high school boys testing the limits of their sexuality. And if that didn't convince you, the bearback bang bros bus driving scene will.  





























 I experienced something very similar to this, but probably worse in my opinion - not even a week ago.

On July 1st, I got off work and was doing some late night grocery shopping - not even that late, it was about 10:30pm - at the Kroger near my house, who also supply several of these handicap grocery carts for disabled customers which are usually located in the front of the store. I had noticed that this evening, there was none available, because a disabled woman was walking around on a cane asking for one. 

I thought it was strange and was like oh well, must be busy - it is the first of the month. Not very many cars in the parking lot, but I guess people are bulking up for the holiday. So I go on shopping.

Inside the store doing my thing, right off the bat I see 3 people on carts who were clearly not disabled. Of which, one guy was letting his kid, a 7 year old - drive it around, while he walked along side. And this was right in front of the store, in ear-shot of that lady who actually needed a one. They could hear her asking for it, still did nothing - kept on going.

It really pissed me off, but I thought well, maybe they're disabled and it's just not evident. I'll hold my tongue, just do my shopping - get out of here.

So I keep on going, I see a 4th cart - same thing. This time 2 young women, which got my attention when one got up and let the other sit/drive the cart. I just stopped and stared at them like... for real? You know there's a lady up front right now who actually needs one of these and you guys are just riding around on it for fun??? And they went off on me, same way this guy did - "YOU CANT TELL US WHAT TO DO" - I just threw my hands up, kept on walking.

I get to the checkout lane, waiting in the only line they have open - when sure enough that kid that was driving one - crashed into a display right next to me, knocking over a fuck-ton of shit. The parents response? Not no, "I'm sorry" or "oops" or anything even remotely fucking human - they just walked away. WALKED AWAY - cart and all. Leaving all that shit.

My Kroger also has a self-checkout lane, but because I had so much stuff I decided to wait in line. So during my long wait, those 2 women who screamed at me for telling them what to do - they checked out right as I was finishing bagging my groceries. I walk outside and they are plugging it in, one talking to the other about how they better hurry - they're going to miss their bus.

Seriously, that was the most frustrating grocery trip I've ever had. I've never felt like a racist before until that moment - because it dawned on me. Out of the 5+ offenders, they were all black. Loud, and ignorant, and black. And the lady who didn't have a cart who actually needed one? White. I seriously wanted to punch those people, especially the cunt black family that crashed the cart into a display, and the poor white Kroger employee just walked over and started picking it up - like it happens all the time. 

I'm never shopping again on the 1st of the month - seriously. It made my blood boil, the whole thing.

 I can't wait for the day when things stop being about black white and yellow and brown and all that stuff and we can just call assholes, assholes. This black guy pisses me off. I'm a black guy and if I call this idiot out, I'm considered someone that's sucking up to white people, by other white people here on reddit. It's already happened multiple times. When you're a black guy and you call out the retarded behavior of other black people instead of prtending it's reasonable behavior, you're called a coon and a sellout by the same black people do this stupid shit.

And all you white middle class liberals need to snap out of this delusion that it's only a hand full of black people like this guy in this video. Take it from someone who knows. a huge percentage of black people have this guy's fucked up mentality. 75% of black mothers are single (the reason why would make this post even longer) and these guys (including myself) are raised by these women alone so they have to over compensate by acting more aggressive and masculine.I got lucky because my family comes from the country and not the inner city. My mother got her masters degree and became a college professor. I went to private school for the first few years of my life and then got an almost culture shock when I went to public school in the 2nd grade (we were never rich or even middle class, but lower middle class. my mom had to retire early after getting really sick, though she's doing well now). Kids in private school were mostly polite. The "bad kids" were just class clowns at worst. But then in private school, all the kids were cursing and using the N-word left and right. There were fights every other day, and I'm pretty sure in like 3 or 4 instances from 2nd to 5th grade there was always that one student who had to sit by himself near the teacher's desk and he clearly needed to be in a special needs class.

My point is that there are a ton of shitty black people out there and there are a good bit of great black people. The same goes with asian, white, latino, etc etc. When a black asshole is being an asshole, everyone should be able to call him or her out on it without being a white racist or a black sellout. Yes, racism exists, but if we're going to move forward we need equality on all fronts. I actually like it if a white person can disagree with me and argue about something and call me out on something if I'm doing something stupid in person, because they're speaking to me in the same way they'd speak to a white person that did the same thing. But when they decide to talk down to me like I didn't know any better because I'm "just a dumb child like black person" and just pretend like I've done something valuable it's irritating. We'd should not be treated like retarded children who don't know any better. That's not going to fix "racism"

 Perhaps more than any other filmmaker in recent years, Christopher Nolan has a following. These so called "Nolanites" love to tout the brilliance of his films, and one of the most popular statements has been to call Nolan a modern Kubrick. Despite being a big fan of Nolan i've never quite understood this statement, especially considering Nolan's visual style does not have much in common with Kubrick's. But I think it goes beyond that, and after seeing Interstellar it finally clicked for me what the biggest difference is: Nolan's films lack subtext. It really is that simple. For whatever reason, Nolan wants his characters to say exactly what they are thinking at any given time. If a character is mad at another character, they will state it plainly. The same goes for every single emotion. There is no misdirection, lying, innuendo, or nuance. It's as if Nolan wants to make sure we understand what the character is feeling and doesn't trust us to infer it by context. This doesn't just relate to character feelings, but also to plot and theme. Look at the ending of Interstellar. When he gets to the weird Library near the end, we get it. We're literally seeing it happen. We don't necessarily understand how it's happening, but we do understand what is happening. Despite this, Nolan decided to have McConaughey and Chastain both state out loud to themselves what is going on, multiple times. Why? We already see what's happening, why exactly do we need the characters to awkwardly reinforce it by talking to themselves? This is especially interesting when you compare this scene to the ending of 2001, a film that Nolanites have been trying to compare to Interstellar since the film was first announced. In that famous ending to 2001, Kubrick doesn't explain anything. He just presents it, and leaves the meaning up to your own interpretation. This forces you to think about the film and what was happening, and is key to why the film is so iconic all these years later. This is night and day different from Nolan's approach to a similarly bizarre event. Nolan chooses to explain it numerous times, just incase we were sleeping I guess, and the ultimate result of this is that we get it. There's nothing to solve, and we leave the theater not questioning "oh what did that mean?" but instead saying "huh, that was interesting" and then proceeding to realize all the plot holes in the film. I admit I was in the crowd of people that was really hoping Nolan would finally "grow up" and make a picture that treats the audience with respect, but after seeing Interstellar i've realized he's just not that kind of filmmaker. Which leads to me the "why that's ok" part. You know what? I really enjoyed Interstellar. It was a blast and one of the most enjoyable theater experiences i've had this year. Despite being 2h49m, which is actually longer than 2001, I never felt bored for a single moment. This is the great skill of Nolan...he makes the most enjoyable blockbusters out there. And I accept that. I no longer wish for him to "grow up", because I actually really enjoy seeing his films. Sure, I don't think about them much afterwards and I will never put them on the same level of the great filmmakers, but for pure entertainment nobody does it better right now than Christopher Nolan, and for that I will always be a fan. 





















































































































































 Bravo Carrey! Brillent. Rely brillent. 

































































































































 Spoilers obviously, but the shot where Nolan ends his film with the platform rising up with Robin inheriting Batman's lair is exactly the same as Mad Max: Fury Road's ending where Furiosa is raised on hte platform to inherit Imortan Joe's lair. 

Bravo Nolan. Bravo Miller.  




 Agree or disagree idc.

Edit: And I don't mean a thriller or black comedy, but no black people. I mean make it Hor ror.

 Reddit is hopelessly in love with talking about itself.  




 Allow me to submit for your fair-minded consideration the following "news diff" of a recent article from the venerable New York Times. Compare and contrast, if you will, these two timestamped versions of the "same" story on Ellen Pao's resignation from Reddit:

[Comparing: Its Silicon Valley 2, Ellen Pao 0: Fighter of Sexism Is Out at Reddit](http://newsdiffs.org/diff/934341/934454/www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/technology/ellen-pao-reddit-chief-executive-resignation.html)

Now you may not care about the goings on at Reddit, but be that as it may, this shoddy piece of yellow journalism perfectly exemplifies the *narrative* that pervades so much of today's news. What was once a merely slanted article entitled "Ellen Pao Is Stepping Down as Reddits Chief" was swiftly replaced by an outright propaganda piece painting Pao as a heroic but embattled warrior for equal rights in the midst of that oppressive white boy's club we call Silicon Valley, wherein she "fell victim" to the overwhelming sexism and racism which is both inherent to the tech scene and rampant among the vile Reddit userbase. Of course nothing could be further from the truth, yet an "op-ed" label somehow escaped this nakedly biased writeup.

In reality, Ellen Pao "fell victim" only to her own poor decisions, her own incompetence, her court-documented history of abusing coworkers and subordinates (male and female), her and her husband's shady grifter past of long-cons and frivolous discrimination suits seeking outrageous payoffs, her being completely out-of-touch with the very community she was brought in to manage, her intentionally vague and widely reviled initiative to transform all of Reddit into a so-called "safe space" (despite years of drastic increases in censorship across almost all of Reddit), her brazen double-standards in applying said policy to ban specific subreddits while leaving many more hateful, toxic, and rule-breaking subreddits untouched, her lack of desire to use Reddit or even understand how it works (in one celebrated instance, she actually tried linking to a message from her own inbox, like a boss), her off-site PR campaigns in defense of her bad decisions and policies on places like Buzzfeed (reviled by many Redditors) rather than engaging directly with the Reddit community (as challenging as that may be), her callous sacking of popular employees such as /u/kickme444 who ran Reddit's yearly secret santa gift exchange and was reportedly terminated *because he had leukemia... even though he was able to work* (he later deleted his story and said he'd only discuss it with Reddit Inc, so it would seem that Pao's legal team intimidated him into shutting up), and last but certainly not least her reply at a company meeting that "you'll have to pry this position from my cold, dead hands" upon being asked how the search for a permanent CEO was going (as alleged by another former employee). This list actually goes on and on; this was really just a high-level overview to illustrate what an incredible human being she is and what an amazing job she did as the interim CEO of an online community that was anathema to her.

In a word, Ellen Pao was nothing short of antithetical to the core values that Reddit and its community were founded upon and have historically espoused, as Pao herself hinted at when she announced her depature:

 gt; "So why am I leaving? Ultimately, the board asked me to demonstrate higher user growth in the next six months than I believe I can deliver while maintaining reddits core principles."

Although Pao succeeded in alienating the vast majority of regulars that populate the site during her brief stint as CEO, the casus belli leading to her ultimate downfall was her sudden firing of Victoria Taylor, a universally beloved Reddit admin and crucial point of contact for moderators when conducting AMAs. The unexpected and flippant dismissal of Victoria for undisclosed but much-conjectured reasons triggered a sitewide revolt led by the site's moderators, who shutdown most major subreddits in protest of her firing, all culminating in a change.org petition for her ouster skyrocketing from 10k signatories over a few months to over 200k in just as many days. The majority of these moderators are very (if not radically) progressive, often to the point of being called "social justice warriors," meaning it's richly disingenuous to attribute Pao's departure to the clamor of right-wing trolls.

But none of that matters one wit because as everyone knows, Redditors hate nothing so much as they hate women and minorities (except fatties, perhaps). I mean seriously, have you even seen some of the vile names of those awful subreddits they let fester there?! Because if you haven't, the media will remind you of their names, again, and again, and again, as if these purposefully provocative subreddits, whose simmering popularity is first and foremost a result of ever-increasing censorship everywhere else, suddenly represent Reddit if and when anyone from an officially-sanctioned victim class waving a flag of ideological jihad comes under fire for being a world-class shitheel.

Never mind that what set off the final firestorm was the termination of a *female* employee. All of this hate couldn't possibly have anything to do with Pao's shady past, or her shady husband, or her terrible judgement, or her detested policies, or her nasty behavior, or her callous firings, or her ideological hubris, or her embrace of censorship, or her double-standards, or her lack of empathy and communication, or her awful leadership, or a staggering number of other failures. No, it couldn't possibly be any of that because as always, **narrative uber alles**. Now that Ellen Pao has been called a bunch of mean names by an army of anonymous trolls, we're stuck in the "poor Ellen" room, and neither her shady past nor her failures as interim CEO bear repeating nor need be scrutinized.

It's therefore a foregone conclusion that Redditors hated Pao because of her race and her gender and because she was a "fighter of sexism" who became "a hero to many." But what did this "hero" accomplish for women exactly? If firing rockstar female employees, banning salary negotiations, screening job candidates for ideological purity, imposing intentionally vague policies of censorship, and exhibiting all the hallmarks of a Harvard-league grifter before losing a $160 million "landmark" discrimination suit is somehow sufficient cause to be lauded as a brave crusader for social justice in the hallowed tradition of Martin Luther King and Susan B. Anthony, then our brave new world is in very big trouble.

Just how and why Reddit's board of directors selected such an inexperienced, ill-suited lightning-rod for mass-hatred to impose overwhelmingly unpopular site changes during a mere handoff period is anyone's best guess, but what we do know is that the seemingly appalling reactions to Pao's brief reign were anticipated well in advance by most reasonable and knowledgable observers of the situation. What's even worse is that the author of the original NYT article actually sallied forth into /r/KotakuInAction, that villainous hivemind of #gamergate misogynerds, ostensibly to conduct his own AMA, wherein he proceeded to dodge every upvoted question challenging the veracity of his  lt;cough gt; narrative due to these aforementioned pesky facts and inconvenient truths, none of which somehow made it into the revised version of his article:

[I'm Mike Isaac, the New York Times Reporter covering Reddit. AmA.](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3cur16/im_mike_isaac_the_new_york_times_reporter/?sort=top)

As you can see, the NYT wasn't even remotely interested in publishing the truth. In all likelihood, this so-called journalist merely stopped in to troll for hate speech and retreated upon finding himself incapable of inciting any salacious tidbits fit to be plastered over his next edition of agitprop masquerading as journalism. But that's just supposition, meaning it's something I would never publish as fact unless I were, you know, a journalist for the New York Times.

But wait, there's more! Here are some other shining examples of unvarnished journalistic integrity, starting with the highly esteemed Guardian:

Credit where credit is due though, NPR surprisingly ran a [relatively even-handed piece](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/10/421877979/ellen-pao-out-as-reddit-ceo). Let's just hope it stays that way.

Now I'm not saying that Pao didn't receive a huge outpouring of crude and spiteful messages, which she clearly did. But somehow I never saw any of these supposed death threats. Yes, there were some death wishes, but let's not conflate "eat shit and die" with "I'll murder you and your family." Such fine details, unfortunately, didn't deter Sam Altman of Reddit's board of directors from dutifully and publicly shaming the Reddit community over their supposed death threats, as though hate mail to polarizing figures in the public eye is unheard of, and as if any would-be murderers reading his patronizing bromide could be dissuaded from sending death threats in the first place. But of course that was not the point of his handwringing exercise in public relations.

Altman's finger-wagging screed in hand, the media had all it needed to run with the narrative that Redditors are literally terrorists, ie. #gamerate redux. And boy did they run. All of these histrionic hyperbolae and identity politics and psychodramas are part and parcel of the media's stock in trade, which is why all of this was predicted well in advance by those following the situation, many of whom are by now all too familiar with its played-out professional victim routine. Manufactured outrage and clueless moral panic from the mainstream media are nothing new to those of us who have lived and breathed old-school internet culture most of our lives. We never forgive and we never forget such classics as: *DOOM caused Columbine. Anonymous: hackers on steroids. Over 9000 penises. Pool's closed. The hacker known as 4chan. #Gamergate*. And so on, and so forth, and so the dragon must be slain over and over and over again, even in our present, supposedly internet-savvy age. Most disturbing of all is that with each manic news cycle, the dragon only grows larger, nastier, and more adept at dividing our society against itself to devour piecemeal both our liberties and our capacity for meaningful and authentic dialog.

 Submission History: The story of two Twenty-something kids, who are basically an internet version of True Detective, and their voluntary mission to hunt pedophiles.  





























 I have to watch 11-11-11 tonight. I've heard the score, but I never saw the movie.  




 You gotta talk about what it's like working with Joseph Bishara tomorrow. I'm really curious about what his work process is like. 




 Reliable Sources is a media commentary show. They can say pretty much whatever they want as long as they don't blatantly say something false like Bill O Riley reported 4 wars with a pen. 




 It is. Yishan is a guy known to fuck.

 I just ate some mac and cheese. 




 Rob Zombie's next film is a bio pic period piece. Which is a weird thing to think of but that's how it be. 




 I wonder if M. Night is just riding the coattails of found footage to say later that his movies still bring in tons of money? Considering the low cost-high reward nature of these shit films it's pretty much written in the stars that his movie is going to make money. 




 Fuck. Minions 2 is gonna happen.

Is Insurgent considered a flop? That was a pretty fucking boring movie to make double its budget instead of three times it.  




 Le-Zank-Mema 




 "Nigga, the G is silent" - says the white kid from Long Island.  




 I said it the way he thought it was pronounced out loud. Now, I'm wondering if anyone ever told him publicly that he's wrong or just let it go.  




  After that movie came out and people saw the female leads doing badass shit with the male lead, they freaked out.

Not just any ol' women. Fucking 40 and 80 year old women doing their own stunts. I, for one, welcome an age where the only thing old people have to do on screen is sit in a hospital bed and say parting words.  




 Thor becomes a women and nerds are apoplectic that women are about to take the whole thing. This is the same debate as Iggy Azelea and Macklemore in Hip-Hop.  




 If you listen to hip-hop and believe that issues of race don't exist, then you probably don't listen to hip hop.  




 When did Jay become handsome? 




 Are you sure you didn't get "Deranged" and "Comedies" mixed up with that last one? 




 I'm also happy that dc's movies look like movies. Marvel has a problem with their stuff looking like a TV set. 




 I can't believe he didn't look into the camera and wink.

 Well, there's a difference between censorship and the shenanigans from that Jesse Jackson AMA.

I think the mods would be well in their right to curate quality questions that don't make us look like a bunch of rabid dogs like "You're a well known race-baiter and huslter. What's it like knowing your the worst thing to happen to race in 60 years."

 I imagine it wouldn't look good with these two possible headlines.

"Former Reddit Employee with Cancer sued by Reddit for Breach of Non-Disclosure"

or

"Ex-Reddit Employee Fakes Cancer Claim to Blame Female CEO for Firing" 

This is what I was aiming at. Reddit is basically gonna make themselves like fools if they take action either way. It's better to let it slide...that is. Unless...Yishan wants to be responsible for some popcorn. 




 [It sounds like he doesn't give a shit anymore](https://twitter.com/yishan/status/619657668261601280) 




 [This popcorn keeps coming. I can't handle it.](https://i.imgur.com/NvhhMqC.jpg) 




 Basically it means that Yishan can freely beat around the bush and Reddit can't really do much. But I was talking about the inevitability that Reddit would go after Yishan for making innocuous statements about how Reddit handled a very public situation because of a nondisclosure provision. I don't even know if he signed one. He would probably have been the one to make the decision on whether to have one. 

It would make Reddit look worse to their user base who will see Yishan as a whistle-blower and in the press because those statements from Yishan are going to get signal boosted. I imagine that if push comes to shove, and with Yishan's tendency to not take shit like that sitting down, we're going to find out in the near future whether the "cancer" statement is true or false.  




 Between this and his public outburst against that shit-talking ex-employee (that was him, wasn't it?) he seems to be an extremely unprofessional individual.

The weird thing about Reddit is that it allows former employees to air their grievances out and corporate has no way of confirming or denying the accusations. Imagine what would have happened if Yishan never responded and just decided to let that simmer. Intimidate public opinion would shift because a Reddit employee says he was fired indiscriminately. 

Yishan basically kicked it in the balls instead of becoming one of those lightening rods for Reddit to seethe at. And then the process repeated itself during the Ellen Pao era, except corporate handled it properly by not putting itself in the area of divulging the nature of someone's employment history. 

All this means is Yishan is clear now to pop some corn around Reddit's offices.  




 Granted that I have no idea what the terms of this guy's termination were, but I can't imagine they didn't include nondisparagement and nondisclosure provisions. And now, in the litany of things that people who are anti-Pao like to rattle off at the merest mention of her, "fired a guy for having cancer" and "pry this position from my cold, dead hands" are regular features.

Think of the position Yishan puts Reddit corporate in now that he said this and KickMe said there's dirt on people and Yishan is going all "fuck it" on Reddit and Twitter.

Reddit is basically one of those justice scales right now and Yishan just tipped it in favor of the transparency set that make Reddit's most vocal members. If Reddit attempts to go after Yishan for just poking around the bush, they're gonna piss off that user base, who'll go fucking nuts and they already got through pissing them off just a few weeks ago.  




 They fired their last PR handler.  




 Ellen Pao and Yishan are friends. Now that they're both out, the gloves are gonna come off. I wonder how this is going to get reported in the press? Ooooooo...this is getting gooooood.  




 Yishanzai! 




 Yishan is the Kernel of Popcorn. And the best part was he ran the company so he's got good shit to air out. It's not like he's entirely wrong, but damn this dude just loves to talk about inside company stuff.

Oh, what a day. What a lovely day! 




 Looks kinda boring.  














 This movie will end up being about The Wolverine again somehow.  




 I would like to see one of these talks with both the directors of Narco Cultura and Cartel Land talking to each other. They both bring up similar issues and I think it probably would lead to a fascinating discussion.  




 Very, very interesting talk. It's interesting to hear the dichotomy between the two subjects of the film. I wonder why with the amount of defense spending that none of it finds its way to the border? This seems like a massive oversight.

I imagine cartels are smart enough not to cause violence on American soil. They probably realize that if they did that would basically mean the beginning of the end of that kind of access to the border.

 I've read Michael Gibney's [Sous Chef](http://www.amazon.com/Sous-Chef-24-Hours-Line/dp/0804177899) which tells a similar story. I gather Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential is in the same vein, but essentially what I gather is that you get 3 hours to prepare for lunch, one hour for break and dinner prep and the rest of the night being behind on orders. Did you ever work in a kitchen with the ambition to become a head chef? From my experience reading these books they're either treated like war narratives or ones where people had the ambition to become head chefs and own their own restaurants. 

Have you thought of starting a sub reddit with the ability to tell all those stories? I'm having a hard time wondering why you mod the subs you mod, bothering with the metaverse and other unsavory subs to put it lightly, and yet you still refer to the guys you worked with as a second family. 




 How did you recognize Reynoldo Rey from 227? I don't think he would even recognize himself from 227 if he was alive. I know you have a history on Reddit but I kind of want to hear more about these kitchen stories. Most interesting customer? Weirdest things that happened in the kitchen?

Also, favorite things to prepare? You said you like cooking and fishing so I'm guessing you like preparing fish on occasion? 




 Do you have any stories to share about cooking? Favorite thing to cook? Worst dish prepared? Worst customer served? You worked in the cooking industry presumably so what's life like on the other side from your perspective? 




 Okay, fine, if you won't answer that question then I won't get into a prolonged battle.

Do you have hobbies?

What are your top 10 favorite books? 

Do you at least recognize that some of the stuff you say is problematic? 




 We ask that you embrace Reddit's diverse culture rather than cleansing it. We get our touchy-feelies on Facebook. We come to Reddit to be reminded that life can be harsh.

Well, there's your problem. James Cameron has to be the least prolific blockbuster director around in his tier next to George Lucas.

 If you can't attack the proof, then attack character. Exactly what I'd expect. This is a sub for intelligent discussion, you don't want it fine, go somewhere else. 

The original claims were: 

1.  Only comments criticizing her incompetence and/or equating her to fascist leaders. 

2.  There are so many people who keep ranting about the racism/sexism, but provide no evidence of these accusations. 

I provided proof of both, twice. Unless you can refute the claim I really don't need to entertain the bunch of childish baby responses I woke up to saying "cunt isn't really sexist, we we just posting we wanted to punch this cunt in the face but it was in the appropriate subreddit! That has nothing to do with gender." Fucking hell, I have one right below you resorting to bromides and un-sourced bullshit.  









  Stop being pedantic. 

Would you prefer I don't treat your comment with the respect you expect it to be given and just say "hurr durr pedatic, ur wrong?" I can't pick out the "spirit of your comment" when it's wrong because the comment that started this conversation was over the fact that someone was denying that any activity whatsoever of sexism occurred let alone made it up to the front page.

For instance, out of all the signatures that signed the Ellen Pao petition the [numbers on the words "Cunt" and "Bitch"](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3cfpoa/word_cloud_of_reddits_ellen_pao_petition_oc/) out pace regular prepositions. And this is out of all participants who commented on the petition. Unfortunately, I don't think they're calling her a "cunt" because they know her personally and therefore can attest to the validity of any of these statements. If you want more fun selections from Reddit's grand petition [enjoy the video from the guy who did the data-mining on it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8IIey7vydM)

In comparison to reddit's 160 million unique monthly visitors, they are a minority. A vocal minority, to be sure, but they represent around 0.1% of the reddit userbase, assuming that every one of those subs is an active, unique user (and they aren't all active and unique).

160 million users of which the [overwhelming majority is male](http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/social-gender/465979). And which an overwhelming majority of that majority managed to launch a large organized temper tantrum resulting in a CEO stepping down making their "DAE Pao is literally Hitler" campaign seem legitimate. Did [Yishan end up getting this treatment when he banned The Fappening?](https://np.reddit.com/r/fuxtaposition/comments/3c1bn6/ellen_pao/) (NSFW). [Did this occur when Yishan instituted policies at Reddit that banned Jailbait?](https://np.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplehate51/comments/39on4t/ellen_paos_cunt_very_nsfw/) (Also NSFW). 


But if you want more proof you really just need to compare the statements of Steve Huffman who essentially rephrased the same policies of Ellen Pao and the responses from the same audience who actively went out of their way to downvote her responses into the thousands. Ultimately, this is a conversation about the pernicious nature of these communities that eventually turn their giant crybaby campaigns into organized efforts to take over the community center. The question becomes do you want these guys (the people who don't contribute or enjoy becoming apart of communities) to be able to take over the community center by rushing from their dank basement and taking a baseball bat to good communities, which seems to happen with regularity now, or does Reddit take the stance that allows free association to also include the ability of free exclusionary measures to weed out those pernicious actors?  They can't have it both ways. 

Not many calls for Huffman as being literally Hitler when he said he wouldn't bring FPH back or that he wanted Reddit to be a safe place for all sorts of communities. Then again this is a different conversation. 

 




 Hugh Jackman looked real burned up about not having a seat. 




 Probably because Sam Raimi pretty much can't top the terror of the first one so he jumped ship and made a three stooges comedy film. It's a remake and yet it's basically a whole new take on a film. 

However, I think that Evil Dead remake is on par with the original. Aaron Motion should be a bigger name in the field of cinematography, but his work on that film is brilliant.  




 I don't know. It's hard to pull off a massive science fiction fantasy and those aren't really a dime a dozen with the kind of production values that The Fifth Element has. I wouldn't say it's perfect, but I think it's damn near close for me to perfect. 




 The Big Lebowski. I've watched it like 3 times and I never understood why people find it so knock down drag out hilarious.  




 Best scene was when they blew up the cat. Other than that, it's a pretty okay vigilante movie that borrows heavily from Michael Bay looking camera work.

 SRD got hit with the accusation that we collectively dogpiled the Dylan Storm comment in Pao's resignation announcement to -700. This must be a new achievement.  




 its a fucking internet site. get over yourself.

A rare moment of self-awareness in a sub devoted to a giant temper tantrum.  




 Shit, it's gonna lead to so many "MODS ARE CENSORING ME" that mods would probably just shut down the sub.  




 The creators I'm talking about literally run all the defaults and the thousands of other medium and small sized subreddits. None of these people are employees of Reddit and they had the power to shut down the subs that account for a lions share of its traffic and Reddit couldn't do jack shit without pissing off even more users. It's insane how much power Reddit corporate has given over the main subs that drive traffic. 

The entire point of Reddit is that you can create the subreddit you want, curate the community you want to have, with no restrictions.  Unfortunately, users seem to believe this entitles them to undermine creators intent by saying that they want the ability to freely post anything if it means posting it, having it removed by a moderator, but still having it be there. You've just removed the ability for moderators to do their job of curating a subreddit, which is exactly what they do thanklessly for free while going about the other obligations of their daily life. 

If moderators at /r/askhistorians want to curate a subreddit that aims to be like a historical journal why would you remove their ability to do that by taking their power away to deal with comments and users that undermine the sub? If I'm an editor of a sub that aims to the editorial standards of The New Yorker, then I don't want a bunch of one line posts about "DAE broken arms jolly racher chris nolgan?" clogging up my pages. But if you want to make a sub that allows that, the Reddit gives you the ability to do so. The issue here is users not realizing the power of editorial decision making is only a click of the button away. Outside of that it becomes a discussion about getting eyes on shit that the moderators didn't want in their subreddit and users complaining about censorship because they weren't able to hijack an audience for what usually are bunk causes.

And I'm overthinking it because these are the issues that will arise. Thinking about it makes sure a policy doesn't go into effect that will drive people away from the site before they make a mistake in implementing it.  




 The part that I enjoyed about his AMA was that he essentially said that they have 50 million to burn through which he thinks means that he has no real expectation to deliver on monetizing those investments. It's gonna get real sticky when they run low on cash and those investors start getting antsy. 




 Because you're taking away the power of moderators and creators of subreddit to create the subreddit they wanted. People seem to misunderstand that Reddit is a place for creators, by creators and made with the purpose that you would curate the experience you want to create. 

If you take that power out of the moderators hands then you're basically asking for all sorts of things that you didn't want. The moderators of these quality subreddits have no obligation to stay and tolerate it. 

You already have moderators here clamping down on shitposts. Can you imagine placing new rules that would ensure higher quality posts and then having the company who tells you to do whatever you want and create the subreddit experience you want that you now have lost that power?  




 The next CEO is just going to be a guy in Costa Rica with no publicly listed address and nameless issuing out draconian orders.  




 I mean all the criticisms that have been leveled against it have already been talked about about. Pretty much taking out the Poison Snake lady and the plot about the Silver Samurai and just making it a "Wolverine Vs the Yakuza" story would have shot that movie right to one of the best comic book films.  




 You won't concede even when I do provide sources, because you're part of this hate movement.

Besides, you already lost the debate a couple of messages ago via a fallacy.

We're done here.

I guess he doesn't have any???? 




 Hundreds of games, books, plays, movies, and events got censored or cancelled or disrupted by SJWs.

wut?????? 




 And I feel like Scorsese wouldn't even include his all important "voice of a pufferfish from Shark Tale" that is essentially to completists.  




  I don't think anyone is saying that there hasn't been any sexism or racism directed at Ms. Pao. 

The original commenter said both that he had seen no posts in the postive numbers that were racist and that "there are so many people who keep ranting about the racism/sexism, but provide no evidence of these accusations."

These are both patently wrong statements which negates yours saying there hasn't been anyone denying that Redditors really shit the bed on this one. And one only has to look at the response when Yishan stepped down as CEO. He was the one behind the banning of both Jailbait and The Fappening and yet my front page was not flooded with babies calling the CEO a cunt, "a gook" and "this fucking bitch."

The complaints against Reddit are valid, but not when you have these type of people attempting to hijack a conversation about the fact that Reddit didn't really give a shit about interacting and communicating with the community that keeps its doors open. And these aren't minority numbers. These are thousands of people as the screenshots show. FPH had 150,000 subs, KiA has 40,000, SRC has around 10,000 and all these people keep giving the community a shit name. Meanwhile, cunt wasn't something thrown around when Yishan did the exact same measures against subreddits like Ellen Pao did. 

 




 How many heads do you have? I need to know to adequately prepare my information for the heads that watched it and the heads that didn't. 




 I meant it would ruin your day to have to go through all the hoops of legal action, as justified as they would be.

"Why can't I just grope all the women I want, man? Your trying to arrest me, you know, ruins the rest of my day."

I hope none of these people become lawyers. They're gonna put a lot of their clients in jail.  




 I imagine they would have more hilarious shots of Dennis Leary looking like someone showed him a squirrel nutsack. 




 I enjoy your backpedaling.

"There's no evidence of sexism or racism"

"Oh, well, cunt is really a term of endearment."

"Oh, well, calling someone a gook isn't racist."

I don't know what you're looking for, but it seems like when presented with evidence you just want people to keep giving it to you until it's a mountain full of it. Then when there's none left to give you'll go, "SEE! I told you. No sexism or racism."

 It's probably a more auspicious event for Tarantino, who will hand the power of dictating musical emotion to Ennio Morrecone, than it is for Morricone to score it.

Morrecone is basically the Eric Roberts of film scoring. He does like seven or eight movies a year, a large work load for his age, if you pay him. He does a ton of weird direct to DVD projects.  




 Why don't they just release an HD trailer?  




 I don't think anyone on /r/movies has seen anything other than comic book movies, Christopher Nolan movies, and an assorted bag of 14 other titles associated with mind fucker filmmakers.  




 It's dehumanising because it breaks people down into races. And I have the nagging suspicion that even if they had had Asians at the forefront of the casting, there'd be complaints that none of them were gay or transsexual or something else.

We're all white on the internet.  









 Oh shit. Batman is in two movies.  




 The Rumpled Shithole

Dick Dickerson and The Castle of the Grotesque. 

The Corn Gorge 

The Meaty Sack

A Repetitious Fingering.  




 
i don't think enough people have seen it because it was a fucking terrible movie, but Identity Thief was pretty much one long mean spirited fat joke after another.  




  And lastly yup, people were right when they were saying thats Robins costume in the backround of the first trailer, and the jokers killed him :(

I hope Jenna Malone is playing the next Robin then.  




 It's weird how uncanny Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder's aesthetic is to each other.  




 Why does he need a coat? 




  I believe that story line is a middle finger to those who hate man of steel simply for the destruction.

Or it's addressing a story point that even David Goyer seemed to scoff at. Whatever he planned in his original script it didn't seem like that was one of them.  




 And thus the age of DC begins.

It will be a glorious fanboy war.  




 There's something hilarious about watching Henry Cavil walk into congress with that suit shot with all the sincerity of a serial killer movie.  




 Who as time to read articles when you have time to pretend your in an online high school movie with stratified cliques? 




 Mah fathur was a gamur. mah granpappy was a gamur and ur gunna be a gahmur sun. 




 For these people it seems, high school never ended. Some just got a bit more "professional" and pretentious with their bullying

High School. High School never changes.  




 Save your money. For the love of everything that is good.  




 The social justice warriors on twitter are not happy this is being made...

who cares?  









 Probably because all those nostalgic nerds raised on MST3000 and Redlettermedia all think they're Buddy Hackett and then start talking during movies. Then there are the teens. Fuck teens. 




 But they're **"nice guys**" 




 All media lies. All media is corrupt. No one believes even traditional print like the New York Times. Gamergate will not be able to fix games journalism or journalism as a whole. But what it can do is open the eyes of those who care about the truth and continue to be a watchdog of the corrupt.

I'LL BELIEVE ANY REDDIT COMMENT BEFORE I BELIEVE FIRST HAND REPORTING. 














 I love the diminutive ["it was just like four guys doing it."](http://i.imgur.com/k0fws6A.jpg)

 




 "Mom, no, look I'm healthy. You want proof? Let me show you this thing called Reddit. This is what it looks like when people shit the bed." 




 because if they made a horror movie that cost money then it would look like Jurassic World. 




 I wonder what it's like to be DavidReiss666 and have people actively attempting to come after him because he won't let them post 8 hour documentaries about holocaust denials? 




 okay. u got da job? when can you start eating hot dog pizzas? 




 u like hot dog pizzas? 




 mramo 




 DJ Khaled is the Mark Twain of our time. true satire.  




 If there's any justice in this world Adam Sandler would announce Grown Ups 3 on the same release date as Pacific Rim 2. 




 We need a fucking Jaeger airplane. 




 Basically this is going to be the best TV series ever and Starz just found itself a viewer. They better not skimp on all the cool as creature effects.  




 SJW ideology has brainwashed the minds of certain people into becoming part of what can truly be described as a hate group that preaches a type of equality called "inclusivity" in a style which can accurately be described as "deliberately exclusionary".
What they do is strategically hide behind politically correct labels and rhetoric that will safely shield them from the criticism or suspicion of the most uncritical eyes and ears at all times, switching their story and affiliations around as needed to maintain the lies they tell. They hide their true motives behind already accepted norms so they can make power grabs to further their influence by talking about only the "victims" (themselves included of course) of supposed social injustices that just need to be corrected. These messages are generally delivered with a sense of self-apparent urgency due to just how offensive these (s)not at all made up(/s) injustices are.

Meanwhile, more SJWs are tactically suppressing the visibility of anyone who might offer reasoned dissent of the notion that there is even an injustice occurring in the first place. They accomplish this using all manner of strategic manipulation of the flow of information to drown out any signals that contradict the victim narrative, once the move to establish it has commenced. How do SJWs obtain such control over the narrative of a subculture? They accomplish this by being in control of what is both seen and said in the groups they attack, while also policing what everyone not currently under attack by them sees and says as well. What they do is find a group of people who are their own subculture that the rest of the world largely doesn't pay any attention to, and they study it. They decipher what is good about it and what makes it popular while digging for what can be maximally portrayed as not so good about it to learn how that culture's rhetoric can be manipulated on as wide a scale as possible. They find online communities where the most people of this subculture gather, then use their influence to gain positions of power within the subculture's highest ranks, and begin infecting the subculture from all angles with their victim politics campaigns, subtly and over time, until it becomes too much for everyone in it to ignore. All reasonable attempts to subvert or remedy the trend are swiftly denied traction.

The inevitable ensuing outrage is then used to point fingers, framing all the angry outbursts as evidence of how abusive and harassing the people belonging to the subculture are. SJWs spread this falsely reframed narrative as far, wide, and quickly as possible within SJW circles, injecting the accusations into the mainstream's consciousness during the height of the backlash. From there, the trap is sprung, and the helpless true victims of such lies and slander are forced to defend themselves and their values in front of a misinformed public. The controversy builds and builds like a fire the SJWs ceaselessly fan the flames of in order to milk all the sympathetic attention they can exploit from it for profit.

The SJWs do all that, while simultaneously saying the only path to true equality is to denounce, shame, and ruin the lives of these whole subcultures of people who have been successfully framed to look like the very enemies of freedom and liberty the SJW ideology itself actually is. The SJWs patronize all resistance by spinning anything that threatens the narrative into more ammo to keep the narrative going. This results in the targeted subcultures becoming divided, and becoming further splintered over and over as SJWs endlessly harass into silence every last loud voice that cries out in opposition. The end goal is to force what remains of the subculture to conform to SJW ideology.
What SJW ideology doesn't want anyone to understand it seems is that the solutions SJWs choose for correcting any perceived social injustices are purely destructive to the relations of literally everyone involved. In other words, the path to progress as far as an SJW is concerned, is backward while giving third parties the appearance of moving forward. SJWs deliberately alienate the mainstream culture from subculture after subculture in this way to "smash the patriarchy", which according to SJWs, is straight men; the whiter the better.

Every group SJWs have infected have all been accused of misogyny, toxic masculinity, and hostile intolerance of minority groups on one level or another at the first sign of resistance. This effectively drives out all the straight males by demonizing their sexuality as well as by their skin color depending on how highly represented their ethnicity is within the subsculture. This means that SJW ideology is, among other nasty revelations, thinly veiled bigoted hatred disguised as critical moral concerns aimed at men primarily. Given that SJWs believe white people are the most privileged race on earth, it is absolutely racist toward white people too.

In effect, SJW Ideology is a tool for dismantling any subculture that is predominantly male, and they call any resistance during the takeover a hate group while the subculture dies of SJW cancer.

GamerGate is the first group that I have seen that not only hasn't given up, but after being pushed around long enough, they're falcon punching SJW attackers back and gaining ground. This shit is like watching Rocky take a beating in the first couple rounds then come back on his opponent with the eye of the tiger theme song playing in the background. This shit is like watching the entire Freeza saga of DBZ. This shit is awesome.

These messages are generally delivered with a sense of self-apparent urgency due to just how offensive these (s)not at all made up(/s) injustices are.

Meanwhile, more SJWs are tactically suppressing the visibility of anyone who might offer reasoned dissent of the notion that there is even an injustice occurring in the first place. They accomplish this using all manner of strategic manipulation of the flow of information to drown out any signals that contradict the victim narrative, once the move to establish it has commenced. How do SJWs obtain such control over the narrative of a subculture? They accomplish this by being in control of what is both seen and said in the groups they attack, while also policing what everyone not currently under attack by them sees and says as well. What they do is find a group of people who are their own subculture that the rest of the world largely doesn't pay any attention to, and they study it. They decipher what is good about it and what makes it popular while digging for what can be maximally portrayed as not so good about it to learn how that culture's rhetoric can be manipulated on as wide a scale as possible. They find online communities where the most people of this subculture gather, then use their influence to gain positions of power within the subculture's highest ranks, and begin infecting the subculture from all angles with their victim politics campaigns, subtly and over time, until it becomes too much for everyone in it to ignore. All reasonable attempts to subvert or remedy the trend are swiftly denied traction.

The inevitable ensuing outrage is then used to point fingers, framing all the angry outbursts as evidence of how abusive and harassing the people belonging to the subculture are. SJWs spread this falsely reframed narrative as far, wide, and quickly as possible within SJW circles, injecting the accusations into the mainstream's consciousness during the height of the backlash. From there, the trap is sprung, and the helpless true victims of such lies and slander are forced to defend themselves and their values in front of a misinformed public. The controversy builds and builds like a fire the SJWs ceaselessly fan the flames of in order to milk all the sympathetic attention they can exploit from it for profit.

The SJWs do all that, while simultaneously saying the only path to true equality is to denounce, shame, and ruin the lives of these whole subcultures of people who have been successfully framed to look like the very enemies of freedom and liberty the SJW ideology itself actually is. The SJWs patronize all resistance by spinning anything that threatens the narrative into more ammo to keep the narrative going. This results in the targeted subcultures becoming divided, and becoming further splintered over and over as SJWs endlessly harass into silence every last loud voice that cries out in opposition. The end goal is to force what remains of the subculture to conform to SJW ideology.
What SJW ideology doesn't want anyone to understand it seems is that the solutions SJWs choose for correcting any perceived social injustices are purely destructive to the relations of literally everyone involved. In other words, the path to progress as far as an SJW is concerned, is backward while giving third parties the appearance of moving forward. SJWs deliberately alienate the mainstream culture from subculture after subculture in this way to "smash the patriarchy", which according to SJWs, is straight men; the whiter the better.

Every group SJWs have infected have all been accused of misogyny, toxic masculinity, and hostile intolerance of minority groups on one level or another at the first sign of resistance. This effectively drives out all the straight males by demonizing their sexuality as well as by their skin color depending on how highly represented their ethnicity is within the subsculture. This means that SJW ideology is, among other nasty revelations, thinly veiled bigoted hatred disguised as critical moral concerns aimed at men primarily. Given that SJWs believe white people are the most privileged race on earth, it is absolutely racist toward white people too.

In effect, SJW Ideology is a tool for dismantling any subculture that is predominantly male, and they call any resistance during the takeover a hate group while the subculture dies of SJW cancer.

GamerGate is the first group that I have seen that not only hasn't given up, but after being pushed around long enough, they're falcon punching SJW attackers back and gaining ground. This shit is like watching Rocky take a beating in the first couple rounds then come back on his opponent with the eye of the tiger theme song playing in the background. This shit is like watching the entire Freeza saga of DBZ. This shit is awesome. 




 SJW ideology has brainwashed the minds of certain people into becoming part of what can truly be described as a hate group that preaches a type of equality called "inclusivity" in a style which can accurately be described as "deliberately exclusionary".
