 Air conditioning. Why is it so noisy and never the right temperature?! 




 I have a laptop with a 10" screen. You can make it full screen and I can read those on the train, but I generally don't like reading off a screen if it's more than 10 pages. 

Also I hate reading off my laptop in bed. I will usually print it off or buy it cause the laptop gets hot.  




 Did you get it? 




 I've got it. I'll email it through. 




 Haha wow how do they enforce that?  




 Yeah fair enough. I was thinking more of publicly available statistics, but of course the insurance companies would record those.  




 I don't think anyone actually records those types of statistics. 

Also, I was providing statistics relevant to car insurance, so I think this is relevant for that purpose.

I am not really saying women are better drivers than men, only that they are involved in different types of accidents. 




 Some stats from my state ([link](http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadsafety/downloads/accidentstats2007.pdf)):

* 2007: "More than a quarter of all speeding drivers and motorcycle riders involved in fatal crashes were males aged 17-25. In contrast, only four per cent of speeding drivers and motorcycle riders involved in fatal crashes were females in that age group."

* 2007: "Fatigue was assessed as being involved in at least 20% of fatal crashes. Thirty-one per cent of the fatigued drivers and motorcycle riders involved in fatal crashes were males aged 40 years or more."

* 2006: 374 male road deaths vs 122 female road deaths 


Women and men may have the same number of accidents overall, but women may have more smaller prangs than men but fewer big accidents - so claims cost less ([link](http://www.carinsuranceexplained.com/car_insurance_explained/men_vs_women.htm)).

 




 I agree with this. As much as people pretend like they are okay with a mental illness, they can't shake their misconceptions. 

A girl where I work told some people she had suffered from severe depression and was on anti-depressants, and I heard hush hush comments from people about it, saying things about how she wasn't stable. It was not done in a nasty tone at all, in fact more of a caring tone, but I still feel she is treated differently to other people. She is very capable of doing the job she was hired to do, and I don't think this should be on people's minds when it comes to her work.

 Computer Science! 

I started out in pure science and ended up veering towards Comp Sci.

I know a lot of people who've done IT and a lot of them have ended up working at banks and consulting, but a few are doing different things. 

Downside is that I graduated in a downturn period. Was really hard to find my first job. I went back to uni and studied more and when I came out again it was great! 

I also like how what I can do can be applied to a lot of different industries. As someone with a short attention span for one particular topic, this is important to me.

What I don't like is that IT is often perceived by business as a service, because in most cases that's precisely what it is. 

I love that I am in IT, and wouldn't do anything else given the choice again now. Now it's just a matter of finding a job I like too :)

 Night and Daycare 




 That describes my organisation exactly! I am going a little bit insane here. I don't think I will hang around for much longer in all honesty, but I hope to do something good while I am here.

I like your advice, and I will keep trying to focus on constructively moving things forward. I guess sometimes I have been a little impatient, and don't always understand management's decisions. I will follow your advice though and listen to my manager and other people who have been around the organisation.

Unfortunately, most of my peers aren't much help. I have asked them and a lot of them seem to have given up on improving the organisation as it has proven to be too hard, and just focus on their technical work and the other job benefits, like the paycheck and leave. I've become rather de-motivated lately, as my peers tell me to enjoy the pay/leave benefits and not to worry about the problems of the business. At this stage in my career I am not yet prepared to do that though, and I am hoping this becomes a valuable learning experience no matter what the outcome.  




 It sounds like you have a lot of really good advice to share, so I thought I would ask a question. It's a bit detailed, but I would greatly appreciate any advice on how to deal with my managers.

I have been working at a large government organisation for 18 months and am quite junior.

Although I'm technical I can see a major problem with the organisation (it is primarily a business issue but has ramifications for IT), and I previously raised it with the 2nd in charge (sort of like COO). I regret that I didn't have a solution at the time, as he asked me what I suggest we need to do. I told him that I would need some time to think and reasearch a solution. After I explained that I may offend my managers for raising it directly with him and not my immediate manager, he said he would send an email inviting me to sit with him and with the head of IT to discuss my ideas. 

After this meeting I told my manager that the 2nd in charge would like to discuss my ideas, and he said I needed to present to him first. I saw that as a good thing as it was a chance to get some valuable feedback.

However, since then I've moved to another manager in the IT department, and this manager would also like me to present to him first, and then if he approves I can present to my senior manager. After presenting to the senior manager, if he approves then I will be able to present to the head of IT and all the other senior managers. If they are all okay with it, then I will be able to meet with the 2nd in charge to discuss my idea. 

I believe this process is going to take a few months and it is quite frustrating, as this is just an idea (and hasn't been approved by anyone yet, and is primarily a business idea), and also the 2nd in charge has asked me to go see him.

I don't know what to do in this sort of situation. I know I can go directly to the 2nd in charge and say that I am still very keen but I have been asked to present to others first before I can talk to him, but I know that will annoy a lot of people. I have spoken to my manager to explain that it wasn't really necessary to present to all senior managers first before going to the 2nd in charge as it was more of a business issue. He couldn't give me a good reason why I had to and in the end said he would talk to the head of IT to see if we can just present to him. 

I just feel that they are putting up roadblocks for me and I am not doing this for me but because I really honestly believe that the organisation will benefit from this (and I have attended senior business meetings where they have raised issues relating to this problem that affect the work). The main reason that I think they are doing it is because it will probably create more work for the IT department, but I believe that if the business thinks it is important then that is up to them to decide and not IT.

I would just like to know what you think is the right thing to do in this sort of situation?

 




 I think you need optimism when you're really young. He will be brought back down to earth in time. I don't think you could get through some of the early challenges in life without optimism. Also agree that he has a lot to learn. 

I think business education is good for helping you know how to manage or run a business but not necessarily give you the skills required to actually produce an output. If he really wants to do these ideas, he might need to learn a second skill.  




 Just got home from work, and don't want to think about anything! 




 A dwarf walks into a bar and he slips over a piece of shit on the floor, he walks off thinking nothing of it.

So the big man kills him.

 Best schools/universities: The quality depends a lot on the teachers. 

University advice: Go introduce yourself and don't be shy asking questions in class, or talking to your lecturers. Pay attention when they tell you what the assessments are/how they are graded, and start working on them early. Don't worry about what other people are doing. Don't fail a subject more than once.

Ways to save money: Don't buy shit you don't need. Food costs a lot - take your own food/snacks.

Getting a job: Just get whatever you can to begin with, then upgrade when you can. 

Can't comment on the other two.

 I'm not great at diagrams, but here's my shot at it: [http://imgur.com/INMR5.gif](http://imgur.com/INMR5.gif) 




 Check whether she usually wears gold or silver colored necklaces. Usually people have a preference for one or the other. I'm not sure what things cost there but I'm guessing 9ct Gold or white gold should be good.

If she likes stones, you can pick a stone in a particular color you think she'll like (sometimes jewellery stores arrange their pendants by the color). Otherwise you can go for something with multiple coloured stones or just a nice simple design with no stones or clear stones. You could also look at lockets if you think she'd like that.

Don't get plated jewellery. I think that stuff is a waste of money because it just wears out and then looks crap. 




 Yeah I don't know if it was because of me (my parents never made an official complaint because they thought it would make it harder for me at school) but the teacher left the school a year later. 




 At a school camp I fell into a ditch playing a game and broke my arm. I couldn't sleep because of the pain, and went to tell the teacher that I thought I'd sprained it. She told me to take a drink of water and go back to bed. I cried myself to sleep.

Then the next day a friend had a bandage so I put it on. The teacher told me to take it off because it was dirty. 

I didn't participate in archery or abseiling which is unusual for me because I love those two things, but she kept treating me like I was overreacting.

I got an x-ray 2 days later and it showed a fracture of the wrist. I got a cast and returned to school. The teacher gave me the dirtiest looks and hated me since then. 




 Haha I didn't notice that!

 Yeah that's pretty selfish lol. I mean she could even use it first and then let you use it, and if she really didn't want to use it after that, then she could throw it out and get a new one since a toothbrush is like $2. I hope she at least let you have some mouthwash. 




 Don't worry she might not like you but I love hair and bananas!!

 Their sheep string internet days are meant to be [nearly over!](http://www.digitaltasmania.org/news/14/58)

Although, they said something about Tasmanians being the first to get a [medical smartcard too back in 2004](http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/security/soa/Tasmania-to-get-first-taste-of-Medicare-smartcard/0,130061744,139154706,00.htm) lol. 

Recently I saw a news story about the fast Tassie internet. They were interviewing locals to see how excited they were about their improved connection speeds. There was about 2 people out on the streets in this tiny town, and they ended up interviewing an old couple who probably didn't even own a computer. 




 I'm worried that he was so specific. Is it okay for the dogs to eat a whole citizen, as long as they don't just take bits and pieces? They're not allowed to waste their food when dogs in Africa are starving? 




 I find the argument that a data mining system (and I'm specifically talking about TIA which no longer exists) produces false positives kind of poor, because correct me if I'm wrong, but false positives come up all the time in investigations. For example during a murder investigation, you would have several suspects most of which are likely to be false positives.

I think the real problem is the fact that you can arrest someone on suspicion of a terrorist attack without proving their guilt/intent like you would normally do in a murder/intent to murder scenario. 

In terms of data mining also, although it's impossible, I think it's a broad decision by US citizens - if you know that known terrorists have engaged in a particular pattern of behaviour, and that other terrorists are likely to also engage in that behaviour, is it okay with you if anyone engaging in that pattern of behavior is scrutinized? Keep in mind the majority of suspects are also likely not to be terrorists. I can't answer that question for you, but for me, if the laws around the system protected me from being falsely accused, and the information was only used for the purpose of identify potential terrorists, then I think I may be okay with it. To be clear, I'm not saying that these conditions hold true. 

The second argument that it's an invasion of privacy/risk of abuse due to free access to personal records is reasonable enough. But can't the FBI/CIA/NSA get this information if they choose to anyway? (I'm seriously asking - because I don't know). It sounds like this system just makes it easier for them through the data warehouse (the article actually doesn't say how they use data mining for this system). 

I can completely understand why people don't trust the government with their information, since some of the new terrorist laws don't seem to protect their rights and are open to abuse. Just like a terrorist shouldn't be able to take away your life, the government shouldn't be able to take away a suspect's livelihood based on a hunch either. I think it's up to law enforcement to recognise that statistical likelihood isn't proof. 

It seems to me that the problem isn't really the system and the access to information. But it's the fact that there is a large amount of room for abuse by law enforcement because of the laws relating to suspected terrorists.

 I started thinking... how could you not notice...

But then I remembered my cat is really fluffy too, and we didn't notice she was pregnant until about 4 weeks before she gave birth to a litter of 4 kittens!! My mum was getting a little worried about my cat's weight and my sister felt her belly and could feel the kittens moving around inside!   




 I'm in Australia. Most gay men I know talk like normal people. I don't think most people would even know they were gay. 

Of my good gay friends, only one of the three is outwardly and obviously gay. He does act a bit like a girl so I think his behaviour is more of a giveaway than the way he talks. 

There would be some people here who talk in a certain way but I am guessing that is their way of expressing themselves, and it might seem 'put on' but maybe it is just their way of letting their personality and thoughts shine through. 




 I reckon you could encourage them to go for another one, but if they really want it then just go with it and be there to support them. My dad never came to any of my games, and while I don't care now when I was a younger I took that as a sign of disinterest/lack of caring about what I do (since sport was so important to me). 




 I'd agree with this. I did a *lot* of sports when I was young, and sport can help you in all areas of life - socially, physically, mentally. You learn how to make friends, how to keep healthy and fit, and how to cope when you're under pressure, how to deal with losing, how good it feels when you do win, and how to juggle sports with school and other activities.  




 I'm not sure if this is the same with most pregnant girls, but my sister at least went into a 'nesting' phase to make the house ready for the baby. If there's anything you can do to improve your house then I think that could help.

Also just give her lots of hugs - I've heard a hug has to be 7 seconds or longer for you to get that good/happy feeling out of it.

 Yeah definitely. My blinds were shining bright red when I got up, but now it is more of a grey and just looks a bit like fog. 




 I keep seeing that in all the photos in the newspaper.  My guess is they don't realise it's dust. When I woke up I thought it was red because of a fire, and then I looked outside it kinda looked like weird fog.  




 I'm pretty sick too with the flu - I've been at home all this week. I've had a lot of trouble sleeping the past couple of nights because of my coughing. This morning, I went outside for just a few seconds to take a look after I noticed the red sky, and came inside and was coughing up a lung. 

I can smell the dust inside but I didn't think it was that bad... Staying home today though.

 There's a few different kinds of late for me. 

First, there's the I'm late because I don't care - this usually involves being at work on time. It's true, it's a direct reflection on the fact that I dislike my job. I do wake up and set out to be on time but just feel lethargic and take forever to get out of the house because I know what lies ahead is another crap day at work. 

Second, I'm late because I have taken on too many things. I did have a job once that required me to be at work by 7am and I worked every day til 7pm. I used to always be rushing and driving way too fast, and found it too stressful. This was more that I didn't get to bed early the night before because I had too much on my schedule. I was working full time and studying part time and just had trouble staying on top of my assignments, sleep and work. 

Third, I'm late because I've been held up. Usually I'll be heading out the door and something important comes up at the last minute. It's not intentional but I have to deal with it at the time. Sometimes it's only 5 minutes, other times its longer, but I really try to ignore things whenever I can. 

Fourth, I'm late because I'm disorganised. I really do plan a time to get to things, but sometimes I just suck. Once I was away from my place on holidays, and forgot to turn on the hot water when I got back, and I stank like cat piss, so had to turn on the hot water so I could have a lukewarm shower to get to an event. Other times I lose my car keys or wallet, because I can also be a messy person. I really hate the fact that I'm me sometimes.

Fifth, I'm late because I'm me. Sometimes I just don't feel like I want to rush. It's stressful rushing, and I will probably just feel like crap if I rush. I won't be late for you if you are waiting in an uncomfortable spot for me though. I may be late if you are with other people and you're not waiting by yourself. I am often late if you are waiting in the comfort of your own home, and I'm pretty sure watching the tv for a few more minutes won't kill you.

There's probably other reasons for other circumstances but I can't think of them right now.

Just wanted to also add, it's not personal or intentional. If I didn't care then I wouldn't plan to see/meet you, and I wouldn't bother continuing a friendship. I realise that most people feel that it is inconsiderate and so more often these days I make a conscious effort to be on time, but what's a few more minutes anyway...

 




 For the other experiment, 21 people doesn't seem to be a big enough sample size once you divide them into 3 activity groups. Interesting results with the mice though...

 Some heels are more difficult to walk in. If you're having trouble, steer clear of tiny heeled stilettos, cause you'll probably just look silly trying to walk. 
If you can find something you like with a bigger heel surface area that touches the ground you'll have more stability and hopefully be more comfortable. If you don't mind wedges these can be great.
Another tip is if you're having trouble walking is try not to go for anything too pointy, cause that makes it harder to balance too. 




 Don't show off too much. Like everyone else said, keep to one feature. Otherwise it just looks tarty. Also don't wear anything too tight, being able to see where your underwear is pulling folds in your skin is not a good look. 

Also skirts should be at or below where your thigh starts to curve inwards is a good rule. 

Be comfortable and confident. You won't look classy and hot if you're uncomfortable with what you're wearing and/or can't walk properly, or if you keep trying to cover yourself. 

 




 There's always something to improve in any house, so I'd just pick something and then learn the different ways of doing it. Repeat as many times as you like. Often the best way to learn about something is to fix something broken. I learnt a lot about toilet cisterns because mine wouldn't stop dripping.  




 I am too busy to look after myself, and when I'm not too busy I make myself busy cause I don't want to think about my problems, but then I do and I get overwhelmed, because I don't look after myself and I get run down. Right now I have a broken shoulder and tonsilitis.

I am actually happy today though. I'd rather be injured and sick than have to go to work :) Plus I get to sleep a lot and eat jelly! 




 What's the occasion? How much do you want to spend?

For a view of the harbour - in customs house - [Cafe Sydney](http://www.cafesydney.com). More expensive and you have to book but great food and awesome view for an occasion (make sure you get the balcony).

For cheaper places, I really like Newtown for Thai (Thai Riffic for a nice seating place or Doytao Thai for cheaper food).

Tony Romas near King Street Wharf is awesome for Ribs. Kinda like american food.

My favourite pizza/italian place is [Made in Italy](http://www.madeinitaly.com.au). I've never eaten at Pyrmont but I have at Wynyard. Wynyard is a takeaway place but the pizza was excellent.

 I'm just wondering if anyone has any comments on using XML for data transfer of small data sets between organisations? My experience so far has been good for this purpose and I haven't noticed any problems. The data comes from HP and Oracle systems and we load it into SQL Server.

Also typed XML hasn't gotten much of a mention here. I thought the validation of a data type was a good thing. Does anyone have any comments on typed XML? 




 The emphasis on sport in Canada sounds similar to in Australia. It's not really like the US. We do have sports teams and maybe some students get sports scholarships (not really sure), but it definitely isn't as big of a deal as I've seen when visiting the US. The point made by Anand999 about getting people to fund the university through sports doesn't really apply here.

 I tried this at my work too, but only had my crappy phone to take a photo with. You could see heaps more than without the tape, as in make out objects, but it was pretty blurry.

That is looking out of a meeting room into the photocopier room! The photo is of tape on the frosted side - I could see both into and out of the room. 

Tried putting tape on both sides of the glass (frosted and non-frosted) - this made no a difference to the level of distortion compared to when it was only on the frosted side.

Tried putting tape on the non-frosted side and that didn't do anything - I couldn't see in or out!

 I actually find this interesting cause I have also found that (in my limited experience) that most of the discrimination towards me has come from other women.  




 Yeah my first job while I was still studying was as first level support on an IT helpdesk, and clients would ring up and assume that I was the receptionist and when I explained I wasn't and I was there to help them, sometimes they would still ask to speak to 'one of the boys'. I'd have to tell them that they were busy and ask again how I could help them. The guys were more experienced than me but 95-99% of client requests I was able to fix myself. 




 Being punched in the throat sucks, but I don't know that I'd like being punched in the boobs/chest either. Are they meant to punch you there? 




 Yeah that's tough. I had a friend who was in a similar situation as you. Some of the older female teachers were quite unfriendly. What level of teaching will you be doing? 




 I am a female in IT. I chose this field because I enjoy it, and it turns out I am good at it. I am not concerned about the gender bias because I feel my qualifications and experience speak for themselves, and so far that has been the case (the only time I have been discriminated against it has not affected my career progress). However, I'm relatively inexperienced and I would love to know other people's experiences in similar environments. 




 I will read, and then if I am feeling energetic still, I will write a list of all the things I have to do the next day, and the thought of that sometimes makes me mentally exhausted and I nod off. Plus if you're like me and think about all your problems, planning out the next day gives you something else to think about besides the problems. I also find that coming on the computer usually makes me stay up longer, so using it right before bed is often not a good idea for me if I'm trying to sleep.  




 Yes! I hate it when people do that on travelators and moving walkways too. Those things take so goddamn long. There's a shopping center near me and they have one on every level. Drives me crazy going there. It's 5 floors but if I know I'm going to the top level I take the carpark stairs instead.  




 I would probably call a pest controller. Then you can try to seal up/remove/clear clutter from any places where they are likely to hide. That is pretty hard when they hide in garden beds though I guess, but hopefully they won't go in your house. 




 Well that is bad timing. Just don't do what this guy did and leave his trousers on the floor between gardening sessions: http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,23002709-5013016,00.html

 I was in a hotel in NYC a while back using the net in the narrow hallway cause the hotel signal didn't reach my room. This random creepy guy came past and asked me if I wanted to join the "party" in his room (with one other guy). I didn't use the net in the hallway anymore after that.   




 We recently had our headlamps replaced in our Toyota 4WD with some crappy ones when they broke. I don't think they were a genuine part, or they were 2nd hand. We drive about a 6-8hr drive (each way) at least 2 times a year in winter to go down south on highways and so we have to drive part of the way at night usually (cause we are slow getting away). The high beam on the old headlamps was really bad - I nearly hit a few dead kangaroos because of this. We got them replaced again with brand new ones after some scary driving experiences and it was HEAPS better - I could see at least 10 times as far. Didn't need HID lights, and I don't know why anyone really would need them. Definitely recommend replacing with the regular lights first before trying annoying HID lights. 




 I thought that the sound of thunder was the result of giants bowling in the sky on top of the clouds. 




 Is the $3 for a one way fare? Our tickets just went up today too. I used to pay AU$9.60 or sometihng like that for a return ticket to work on the train from my parents (approx 25km), but now it's AU$10 (USD$8.96/CAD$9.41) return. 

Bus isn't much better. When I'm at my city place (approx 5km from work), it costs me AU$2.60 each way on the bus.

I feel so ripped off.  




 We have trains here (Sydney). Then after 1am or something like that, they have nightride buses for most of the major train lines. Do you have anything like that once the subway stops or do you get stranded in the city/downtown?
 




 I think the gang-rape thing happened once or twice, and it hit newspapers pretty hard. I don't remember it being like a common trend. Most of those guys got decent prison sentences for the really bad rape, but some of them got away pretty lightly. 

The beach thing that happened was really disappointing. I definitely think the media fulled that incident, and I think most of the locals disapproved but there are idiots everywhere and sometimes it only takes a few. I definitely think there was a problem there long before this happened, and I think there still is. I honestly don't know what the solution is. Most of the guys are just stupid teenagers/young adults and are showing off to their friends in the most intolerable ways possible.
 




 I live in Sydney too. 

I agree about the people being rude. It's amazing how lonely you can feel with so many people around. I live and work in the city, but it is a bit stressful sometimes and I miss the open space that I have at my parents in the suburbs. Even then it's not as nice out there as it used to be, since the bush is now all gone and new housing developments went up when I was a kid. I remember when we used to go to the shopping centre everyone knew each other and we couldn't go through without mum having a million conversations... I used to think grocery shopping took forever... but now I realise we had it good. It's not like that as much anymore. 

Sure there are crowds at big events, but then again you don't have to go if you don't like that sort of thing. There are quite a few jerks around that just don't care about anyone else's experience, so you have to learn a great deal of tolerance and not let it get to you, otherwise you can never enjoy yourself. That said, sometimes it's hard to ignore. I went out to dinner one night (kind of late - 11pm), and saw 3 people throw up in the street while we were walking to the restaurant (in the space of one block). I was kind of glad we were too late to get food from for the restaurant. If you are with a group of friends and can ignore it, the atmosphere can be great (as long as you know the best spot to go). 

With the immigration, I agree there's a problem there in terms of people actively not wanting to be part of Australian society. Obviously I am glad some people have cultural identity, and can feel like they belong somewhere, but so often I feel like some have no respect for any other race or culture aside from their own, and often do try to intimidate you so they can force some sort of feeble excuse for respect from you. It's not like that everywhere in Sydney, and I think you can have a completely different experience and quality of life if you live in a nicer suburb as you suggested. I think that's like a lot of large cities as well, and because I haven't lived anywhere very long term I don't know enough to say that other places are any better. I'd like to think they would be though.

I used to go surfing a bit when I was younger and nowadays I don't like it so much. I used to go to Cronulla (where the riots happened a few years back) quite regularly. I had some problems myself long before that incident. I don't like city beaches much anymore. Especially after finding 3 syringes in the sand on separate occasions. That all said I will still go surfing and for most of the time (not hot ones cause those are the days that attract the idiots), it is a nice place. Advice tho: wear thongs   don't build sandcastles far away from the water's edge cause the rubbish tractors don't clear the edges of the beach very well.  

I used to love Sydney because I thought it had everything - beautiful harbour, beautiful beaches, convenient local area shopping centers, good restaurants, good nightlife, multiculturalism, etc. - but as I get older and see more of Sydney I think sometimes I feel that the things I dislike about it are outweighing the benefits as well. 

I have really mixed feelings about this place, and so often I do feel like I hate it. I definitely want to get out and experience other places as well. 

 




 My biggest fear is making a mess of my life, and screwing it up so bad I will lose everyone and everything that matters, and will eventually die alone with my own self pity and regret. 




 Shakespeare had a lot of themes in his plays, like greed, guilt, temptation, love, hate, revenge, forgiveness, violence, jealousy, etc. Maybe if you can pick a theme that interests you it might be a starting point for some ideas. (Oh, and I'm not saying to do a shakespeare style play or anything like that... just to get some ideas).

Otherwise what would interest your audience? Or you? What's something you've learned in life, or a interesting event that has happened? Anything interesting you've learned from someone else?  




 We were out watching fireworks a few years back and after they end the city goes crazy with drunks everywhere. I saw this girl and guy fighting, after which the guy punches her in the face. Probably cause she is a bit drunk she falls straight from her feet onto her head on the curb, with no arm out or anything. I hear this loud cracking noise as her head hits the curb, and the guy walks off, leaving her with her friend. The girl was probably okay because I heard her screaming and crying after she fell. I saw some police nearby who are stopping people from going on the bridge. I walked up to the first one and explained what happened a few meters away and asked if he could call an ambulance. He explained he was too busy watching the bridge. I walked over to the other cop working with him who was clearly the more senior cop and he called an ambulance. Not blaming the cop they were probably overwhelmed but that was a weird thing to see. 




 I think this time she should get all the cash. Maybe next time half :P 




 Explosive Diarrhea 




 I have this (Lite White):
http://www.dairyfarmers.com.au/df/ourproductsandrecipes/milk/dairyfarmersbrlitewhite

I used to hate skim milk but I am lactose intolerant so I get sick drinking full cream milk now. But I can drink this and it tastes good. 

I should get a job advertising this milk. 




 When I was a kid, my sister and I thought it was a great idea to eat hot two minute noodles (including the boiling water) on the trampoline. It was decided I would get up there first, she'd pass me the bowl (which I held on my lap), and then she'd get up afterwards, and we could enjoy noodles and trampolining concurrently.

I burnt my whole right upper leg and spent a few weeks sitting down and having this white cooling cream applied to the burns.  




 The OP annoyed the Twatty guy, who got up in anger and asked the rhetorical question "Do you know who my father is?" as if implying he is a man of great influence or importance, and someone not to be messed with. 

By interpreting the question non-rhetorically you could assume the person really doesn't know who their father is. The OP uses this to offend the Twatty guy by responding with "No. Have you tried asking your mother?" and implying that the mother either slept around or was no longer involved with the father of the Twatty guy.

I'm not great with explanations but hopefully that clears it up. 




 You're welcome! Happy New Year! 




 Looks like you're there! :P 




 Most of my debt is from FEE-HELP/HECS. 




 The only big accident I've had was reversing into my sister's car from the garage cause the outside light was broken and my car is a bit chunky at the back and I didn't look properly. 

Then after this, instead of getting out to check the damage, I drove forward again to separate the cars and pulled out some pipe full of oil that my tow bar had got stuck under. The car was spurting oil all over the driveway. Oh god I'm stupid. 




 Read the news, learn about other ways of life, meet non-US born people and learn some of the other countries' history.

I think learning history will make you appreciate other cultures more, and the things they have done in the past and present.

Also I liked doing charity volunteering a little while ago just on a few occasions, but for the few days I did it, the whole time I was thinking about how little people in these other places had and how much capacity we have to give.  




 Thanks. That's both disgusting and informative. 

Wouldn't wearing socks mean your feet don't dry properly though and you would make the bacteria growth worse? I mean even if I dry my feet with a towel I like to let them air a little bit before putting on socks or shoes. 




 My cousin is like this. He wouldn't eat anything besides meat and rice. My dad used to always ask him if he was constipated. 




 Same with me. I couldn't have any type of cheese unless it was melted on toast or pizza. Then I was introduced slowly to all different types of cheese and I realised that there are a billion types of cheese besides tasty cheese and those cheese sticks which I still think are gross! 

I still don't like all cheese but sometimes cheese just makes a sandwich or a meal! :) 




 Did you get an invite? I have a friend who's been on reddit for 2 months but won't be able to join cause apparently it's too short :(

It sucks cause he's the one who introduced me to reddit, he just didn't sign up for ages! 




 I sent you something small to say thanks! You started something awesome on reddit! :) 




 They have a minimum length of membership too. :( 




 I usually find a comment that says the same thing I would say and upvote it - otherwise you would have 1000 comments that are exactly the same, and that's kind of boring to read. 




 This is awesome. Thank you! Merry Christmas :) 




 I just found this. Thanks! 




 State: New South Wales 




 Cronulla. They upgraded the STP back in 1998 - haven't had any more ear infections since luckily. It used to be the dirtiest beach water in Sydney before that. 

One of my friends mum's also used to surf and now has permanent ear problems from getting ear infections, so I'm glad nothing permanent has happened to me.  




 SMH:
[http://www.smh.com.au/national/skydiver-dead-after-13th-jump-20091128-jxz5.html](http://www.smh.com.au/national/skydiver-dead-after-13th-jump-20091128-jxz5.html)

I think a couple of people die every year out there. I would freak out at that particular place cause they get dropped out right near the highway. I've seen some guys get pretty close to the traffic. 




 Yeah I used to get quite a few ear infections before they upgraded the sewage treatment plant.  




 I've swum there! I'm still more scared of [box jellyfish](http://www.barrierreefaustralia.com/the-great-barrier-reef/jellyfish.htm) than great whites, because with box jellyfish:
 

 You have virtually no chance of surviving the venomous sting, unless treated immediately. The pain is so excruciating and overwhelming that you would most likely go into shock and drown before reaching the shore. 









 I think some of it is to do with attitude towards a problem. 

The bigger the learning curve the more fear you have I.e. the bigger the perceived 'hardness'.

Sometimes learning something new can be really hard, because you might not have all the necessary background knowledge or know the terminology, and so at first you don't take it in. If you persist with it long enough and get past this point, the result can be really rewarding. 

I sometimes think maybe people have found something hard, began working on it but not persisted long enough to get the reward. So the next time they see a problem, they have an even bigger mental barrier because they didn't feel the satisfaction from last time. If this is a problem, at least for me I found the best thing to do is break it down into parts and then each time you understand a part you will feel a bit better - trying to understand a huge problem in one go can be really demotivating. 




 I went out with a guy that smoked and I didn't let him do it around me. I didn't break up with him, but I still didn't like it.

I don't consider objecting to someone else smoking as being controlling - more that you care about that person and don't want them to get addicted, waste money or damage their health. In reality, I could never stop him from smoking - he could just do it behind my back - but I did tell him how I felt about it and in the end he made his own decision to quit. 




 * Like this magnet on metal we joining together,
So make sure you're there when we make it forever.

* You might remember this date in your head,
But to be safe here's a magnet with the date we will wed.

* We'd love you to be attending our wedding, 
So here's a magnet so you don't go forgetting.

* Put this magnet somewhere you'll remember,
The date we'll make our vows together!

* This invitation has a magnetic field,
To make sure you're there when we seal the deal! 




 Don't you get cockroaches or insects? I live in a unit - if I left dishes out the cockroaches would come from all the other units and infest my place.  




 I don't expect everyone to smile back or that they are necessarily depressed cause they don't smile back, but I like it when they do.  




 It's for the buses. You buy ten trips in advance on Sydney Buses, and put it into the green ticket reader box when you get on a bus and it reads the magnetic strip and prints the trip on the back (bus number and time). They've been around for a while but you didn't have to use them before.
See the [Transport Infoline Website](http://www.131500.com.au/faresandpasses/sydneybuses_travelten.asp). Looks like [this](http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/object3/1528/118/n91760107804_3407.jpg) - non-concession adult has white instead of yellow background. 




 Everyone poops! If you didn't paint her walls with your poop I don't see any problem. Besides that, I guess it's her fault if her walls are so thin she can hear.
 
I can think of a few things you can do though:

A) You can try turning on the tv or radio beforehand if possible. Then just let it rip. Flush it and act like nothing happened. Avoid going near the bathroom for a while.

B) Get her to go to the toilet first and then act subtly disgusted and pretend like it sounded/smelt horrible. Then she'll be so worried about how horrible her poo was she won't even care if yours sounds/smells bad. 

C) Show her how awesome the poo you just did was. 




 Friendliness. Where I live people can be pretty unfriendly, and I hardly see people smile... it's kind of sad. I try to smile at people (whenever it's not weird) and I really like it when people smile back. :)  




 It's kind of hard to notice things when you live here cause it happens so slowly when you're here. Here's a few things I can think of off the top of my head:

* The Harbour Bridge and some other places are now cashless. You need one of those e-tags to cross it now. I hate toll roads. 

* Buses around the city require you to have a travel 10 to get on/off buses during peak periods (I think it's 7am-7pm but I can't remember), so you can't pay cash to travel. I think this is probably a good thing but most people who travel regularly get Travel 10s anyway cause they're cheaper. 

* There was some stuff going on with Bikie Gangs which is still happening. They [bludgeoned some guy to death at the domestic terminal](http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/03/30/2530292.htm). 

* The international airport (departure) was getting upgraded and had barely any food in the food court there. It sucks to hang around at before a flight. [Due to finish 2010](http://www.sydneyairport.com.au/sacl/International-Terminal---Expansion-and-Upgrade.html).

* If you're already in Australia this won't make any difference but here anyway - 
[Utility costs have gone up](http://www.switzer.com.au/latest-news/news-stories/record-lift-in-utility-charges-proves-inflation-bogy/): 
Utility charges rose by a record (37 years) 10.2 per cent in the September quarter. Utility charges rose by 13.4 per cent over the year  the biggest increase in 26 years.

* Pitt Street mall is going through an upgrade. Not a very pretty sight at the moment (not that it really was before).

* RTA penalties for speeding have changed a few times now. P platers have zero alcohol limit now, and there are some new anti-hoon laws. 

* More and more school zones have flashing lights now when it is 40km/h

* God damn birds! I used to open my balcony window in the mornings, but the miner birds are trying to nest, and a pair flew into my unit (I'm on the 4th floor), as did a pigeon. Pigeons at least are pretty predictable and so that one just kept flying at the window trying to get out. I caught it with a towel and let it out. Then a few days later some miner birds flew in and were scared shitless of me, so shitless, they shat all over my unit. I had bird poop everywhere. This, along with the time a turkey tried to steal my lunch, now mean I only like some birds. 
 




 I hate cyclists mainly because of their outfits. How streamlined do they really need to be? I want to hold my food down. 




 Thanks for this article. I heard so many different opinions and didn't really understand what was going on. It makes more sense now.  




 From the Telegraph: [link](http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/grant-edward-brown-refused-bail-after-being-charged-with-unprovoked-attack-on-circular-quay-to-manly-ferry/story-e6freuy9-1225798655514)

**Grant Edward Brown refused bail after being charged with unprovoked attack on Circular Quay to Manly ferry**

*November 17, 2009 3:31PM*


A PERSONAL trainer accused of striking a 70-year-old man in the head in a bout of unprovoked violence on a Manly ferry has been refused bail for the protection of the community.

Grant Edward Brown, 31, was charged with recklessly wounding after the incident on the Queenscliff ferry shortly after it left Circular Quay at 6pm yesterday.

Police allege Brown, visiting from Tasmania, struck John Edward Lane once to the face, causing him to fall heavily and his head hit the ground.

Documents tendered to Central Local Court this afternoon have revealed Brown was allegedly talking loudly and aggressively on a telephone shortly before the incident.

To the unknown person on the phone, Brown allegedly said: If someone on this ferry gets their head punched in, it will be on you.

A short time later, he was allegedly acting aggressively, kicking walls and bins before a companion of Mr Lanes then alleged approached him and told him to calm down.

He refused, threatening to bash your head in.

When Mr Lane then interjected urging him to relax as well, he was told: Step away, I swear Im going to punch your f***ing head in.

He then allegedly struck Mr Lane with a closed fist, causing the victim to fall to the ground and strike his head on the deck.

Witnesses have told police of seeing a large amount of blood and then hearing the accused man become hysterical: Someone help him, someone help him.

Magistrate Allan Moore refused the Tasmanian bail, saying he was not satisfied that the community would be safe if he was released to bail.

The case will be re-mentioned on Friday.
 




 Sure they have good facilities but how come it still looks so grey and work-like :( 




 I'm not sure if you mean modern day or older times, but for people who really travelled long distances, look up the older explorers from before the 19th century. 

You can start with this [list of explorers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_explorers) on Wikipedia. 




 Do you live under a bridge? 




 This is good but more relevant for essays and reports I think. 




 Those are pretty good. I like the [single fork](http://www.moolf.com/images/stories/Interesting/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe-9.jpg), [can lid](http://www.moolf.com/images/stories/Interesting/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe-14.jpg) and the [bee](http://www.moolf.com/images/stories/Interesting/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe-33.jpg).  




 Yeah that's the difference. Ours get a decent wage so we don't have to tip. 

I also only recently learned you have to tip in Canada too. I thought they had the same system as Australia. 
 




 Does it vary from place to place or is it the same all over the US?
 




  Try to die in a month when the demand for funeral services is low.  Perhaps the summer or a temperate spring.  Your loved ones may get a good deal that way.

Okay I'll do my best. 




 Some of the first shots at night are a bit too dark to really see anything, or from different angles. The later ones are good. It's interesting to see most things haven't changed that much though. 




 Did it taste like Fanta?  




 Can someone explain to me how tipping works?

I gathered this:

Most places: 15%

Small towns: 10%

NYC: 20%

And then is it 5% either side of that if you liked or didn't like the service?
 




 My uncle went on the Queen Elizabeth II cruise ship and it was all you can eat all the time. He said there were some americans that had the following meals (each with a full buffet style serving):

* Breakfast

* Morning Tea

* Brunch

* Lunch

* Afternoon Tea

* Dinner (Entres included)

* Dessert

* Supper

When they docked they didn't have enough time to unload all the human waste - there were trucks lining up to take away the sewerage, so the ship left with still plenty of gunk on board.

He is not young (75+) and he said they were the fattest people he'd seen in his life. 




 Yeah :( 

It took me ages to notice too cause I always stare out the window. I only noticed once we went into the tunnels and I saw his reflection in the window.  




 I get the train and the bus, and I don't like public transport because:

* It's expensive

* It's slow

* If the buses fills up they don't stop to let passengers on. So you can't rely on it to get you somewhere on time. The next bus might not be for another 20 minutes.

* Has sick people spreading their illnesses

* It's uncomfortable and crowded - sometimes I can't get a seat and have to stand up, and sometimes I get squished by someone, I also do my groceries and have to carry them on my lap because someone decided to sit next to me with all my groceries instead of one of the other free chairs.

* It's dirty - people always leave their rubbish on the train, especially the later ones after peak hour.

* Bad experiences - a guy once jerked off next to me on the train.


I still catch public transport only because

* It's still slightly cheaper than driving

* The train can be faster than driving in peak hour

I sometimes stay near work and just walk to work, but it is 4km over fairly hilly terrain and can be a little tiring after a long work day, and not that safe. 




 The rule only applies to diagraphs ([link](http://alt-usage-english.org/I_before_E.html)). 




 Or nutella and banana! 




 Fair enough, I guess I found it hard to know what to buy. I half expected that multi grain bread would be just savoury type bread with grains in it, but it was heaps sweet. We don't have any bread that is sweet in the supermarket. Maybe if I went with an American they could have shown me what to buy.  




 I just went to a regular supermarket.  




 Don't worry about that! Just go for it! Have a little faith in yourself. The more obstacles you overcome the more confidence you'll gain, and things will hopefully become easier for you the more experience and knowledge you get. 




 I have always had pretty clear skin, but acne never bothered me on anyone else.

My ex had a lot of acne. When he got older it just went away naturally. He got a face peel done and it looked like he'd never had acne in the first place.  




 oink oink 




 I think what's gross is how pretty much all American food has a high concentration of sugar. For example, bread, cheese, breakfast cereals. The cheese from a regular supermarket there actually tastes like McDonalds cheese, and the bread is like lolly bread. Where do Americans go to buy savoury things, or things with no sugar?  




 I love avocados! 




 I think the US has the largest meal sizes for McDonalds. It's bad enough in the small sizes but the big sizes are just sickening (yet somehow still tasty). 

Their small meal size is equivalent to our medium, and their medium is our large. I'm not sure if a US-sized large McDonalds meal even exists here. 




 Does anyone actually finish their plate there? I've been to the US a couple of times now and I never finished a meal. They were like family sized servings. 




 I don't think your host family is representative of the rest of Australia. We eat pumpkin plenty. But we just don't normally make it into a pie. 




 Sorry, I have no idea. I'm not in that area. I'd need the name of the article to find it. Can you remember the author or journal name? Maybe try a search there. If you can find an link online that's even better. 




 Did you have to pee when you woke up? 




 Bleach is the way to go. Just make sure the room is well ventilated.

Also [DON'T mix bleach and ammonia](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/classic/A795611). It produces toxic gases. Ammonia is contained in some household cleaners ([link](http://www.npi.gov.au/database/substance-info/profiles/pubs/ammonia.pdf)).

  




 This is all John West's fault. We don't have to have the best!! All tuna is excellent. 




 Take lunch breaks. For my first job I didn't. You need that - even 15 minutes - to just have a break and calm/de-stress yourself.

 Good Irish Yodel Farts? 




 Go in for the kiss and when she closes her eyes to wait for it, slap on some wax and let it rip! She'll thank you later. 




 Bad timing 




 A table was standing next to two stacked chairs. A gnome wearing a pointy hat was learning how to dance. He took three steps right and knocked the chairs off their neat stack. 




 Also good if you're paying for part of a meal shared with friends. Then you can just round up the amount to the nearest whole note you have. 





























 I was looking for something else and I just found a story about a real life Lassie (except not a collie rough):

 :) I really really want one. I live in a small apartment but hopefully I can move out soon into a house and get one. We also had a cat we got at the same time and they were best friends. My cat used to curl up in the dog's fur and sleep. I have a better photo somewhere - I can't find it at the moment - but I love this one of them playing together: http://i.imgur.com/EG6J8.jpg.
...though my cat doesn't really look too happy about this game hehe. 




 It was 12 years ago now and thinking about him made me shed a tear. He was ours from when I was a toddler and he was a puppy. Collies are such loving and loyal dogs. I went through some difficult years too and somehow he always made me feel so much better and less alone. I always felt like he knew how I was feeling and just wanted to make everything ok. You're lucky to have him. I wish dogs lived longer.  




 My dog looked almost the same. I miss him so much. He was my best friend for so long. He used to let me cry on him and hug him when I was sad. 




 It might be 40 degrees on occasion in January but usually it's not that hot - check out the weather charts. You'll be here 8 months too so will get cooler in Winter to something like what it is now.

I live near Annandale and $200 is cheap. Start looking now (just to get an idea) on www.domain.com.au for rental places. You can use the ipad app to search around UNSW if you want to. It's pretty good. 




 I got the flu and had similar symptoms. My muscles were really achey and my skin hurt to touch. I was really exhausted but couldn't get comfortable or sleep properly, waking up several times in the night. I was a bit restless. I think I also got a cold while I had the flu, and got really phlegmy. I got a really bad cough and it wouldn't go away. After two weeks of this, and occasionally coughing so hard I threw up a few times, I got some antibiotics. They helped a bit but it didn't just disappear. I got sick in around June and feel about 95% of my healthy self. Cough is still slightly lingering though. I think I just need more sleep. 









 When you do find your own place you will probably need a car to go buy stuff for it. There are a couple of carshare companies (e.g. goget) running in Sydney around the city areas, so this is handy. You can use them to pick up furniture from Ikea at Tempe or Rhodes if that is your thing. It's also handy if you want to get out of the city for the weekend. I have a friend who moved here from Sweden and he is using them as he only needs a car occasionally and he said it is quite good. 









 I went there in April this year. I hadn't been since I was a kid. I copied some photos for you here: http://imgur.com/a/vOeL5.

The turquoise lake is just outside the entrance Jenolan caves and is a really short round trip walk (takes about 15 minutes if you walk slow). 

Just a quick couple of notes. You need a whole day down there, and you should do a cave tour. Inside the caves it is cold so take a warm jacket and good walking shoes. The road is one way down the bottom where they allow inbound traffic only for about an hour or so of the day to allow buses to get down there. 

Oh and go early - especially on long weekends - tickets to some of the more popular tours book out early so you will have to wait around for your tour if that happens. I think you can buy them online (not sure?) which is probably the best idea if available. 




 I think it is great that you are having a positive influence on your daughters life. I don't think religion is as bad as many people make it out to be, although often people stop challenging the system of beliefs put forward by their faith, and that is the most worrying. 

I agree with BlackdogLao that teaching philosophy also is a good idea. When I studied it at uni, everyone had their own input, from all different religious and non-religious backgrounds. Nobody was wrong, but nobody was right, because most philosophical issues are not that clear cut. For example, questions like "You are on a beach and there are 2 people drowning. You can only save one. One is a young person about 21 with their whole life ahead of them. One is your grandfather who may only have a few years left to live. Who should you save?". Some systems of belief teach you that you should save the person with more years to live, but of course most people will want to save their grandfather. 

I am glad you have her interests at heart and it seems you are trying to provide her with a good education. When she gets older she can make her own mind up.  




 You know you can get a door wedge for that? 




 I think entitlement is one of the things that can really tear siblings apart when their parents get old. 

I would prefer my parents teach me how to manage the money that I have/make, than just give me things which I did not earn. That said, a helping hand is good on occasions for the right things.  




 When I was really young we stayed at a motel where they put dishwashing liquid into a glass next to the coffee and tea. I thought it was a welcome refreshment and I drank it. I wish I became a human bubble gun, but I just felt really sick. 




 Not worth it for a lifetime of ridicule. 




 That's spectacular. Makes me want to go there.

 Hobbits would have been good. I wish I saw a show about Hobbits. 




 It looks like Sylvania Waters from the heli shot. 




 Being from the Shire I watched this show only to see what it was. I thought it might be good for a laugh but it wasn't entertaining in the slightest - none of the characters intrigued me, and there was no life story which I wanted to follow. I really don't care what happens to them. I wanted to stab myself in the eyes with a ballpoint pen. I could never put myself through another episode.  




 I'm from Australia. I didn't know it was called bell pepper in a lot of other places until today. :) 









 hehehe cute cat :) He/she has getting in the box down pat, just not the getting out part :P  




 I am currently suffering in really cold air conditioning and searched for topics about air con :P 




 It depends what climate you live in. I went to North Queensland with 95% humidity and 35degC heat, and went on a snorkelling tour where I got heatstroke. And since the water was 26degC it wasn't even cooling at all. I had to go hang out in the shopping center because it was the only place I could get cool in the aircon. 

But being back in Sydney I could easily go without air conditioning. And I actually I find it to be too cold most of the time, especially since every part of the office seems to get different amounts of cold. I also find it circulates all the sicknesses throughout the office and that tends to be worse when it's cold air than hot air.

In the end especially in shared spaces, I would rather have neither. I would miss heating a little bit, and I would miss air con a little bit, but only at the mid-winter and mid-summer days of the year. The rest of the time I'm fine, and since everyone has different preferences for hot/cold it's hard to make everyone happy. At least if nature sets the temperature we save on energy costs/waste. 




 I'm in Shanghai. My flight was actually due out tomorrow (Sat 7th Aug) night but it looks like it will most likely be delayed. I have never been through a Cyclone/Typhoon/Hurricane. I'm in a 12 storey apartment building. I know the basics, like fill the bathtubs with water, get drinking water, non-refrigerated types of food, batteries, torch and radio. 

I'm not sure if I should go to the airport or not - I plan to try to clarify closer to the flight time, but I want to ring in the morning because they will probably be flooded with calls tomorrow afternoon.

I'm expecting lots of rain, power outages and closed shops. 

Is there anything else I should do to prepare/be aware of?  




 I would be interested in the answer to this. More the un-homelessing part.

 Depends if you want to go on a weekday or weekend and what time, and I don't know your price range but I just thought of a couple of places I've been off the top of my head you could look up in the cbd:

* Max Brenners near Wynyard station
* GPO cafe (not sure of the name) - There's 2 inside
* La Guillotine behind Town Hall (actually a restaurant)
* Lime Cafe
* Boy Charlton Poolside Cafe (http://www.poolsidecafe.com.au/cafe/home/) - good on a nice day

 I did this a lot after I got a new fridge. I kept misjudging how far out the door came and my toes would get jammed under the door between the door and floor as I opened it. I think if it got the big toe it would've stopped the door from opening, so I'd have to be in the perfect little toe stubbing position for the fridge to cause any damage... and it happened a lot.  




 I don't know much about bullying or what to do about it but this site seems to have some good advice:

 I wish I had a maths teacher like you. I also wish I was a better maths student in High School. I used to play up a bit cause I didn't understand some of the concepts so to entertain myself I did other things in class. I should have just asked for help.

The gap from High School maths to Uni maths was huge for me. It wasn't actually that I couldn't do it, but that I didn't know what I missed in High School that I needed to know to learn what I was learning at uni (if that makes sense). I got my friends to tell me and I was fine. And after getting past that hurdle I actually really enjoyed Integral Calculus at uni. Second year maths was much more fun that first year maths. I now do a lot of applied maths and I love applied maths even more. 




 Yum 




 Wow great explanation. 




 I'd like to understand why you prefer Australia to be a UK colony?  




 Unless he is the Queen and he holds the highest rank. Then it works.  




 The UK National Anthem "God save the Queen" seems somewhat similar to the US Pledge of Allegiance in its intent.

Australia still has "God save the Queen" as it's Royal Anthem (which I actually only just found out cause nobody here uses it really, I think it's just reserved for royal visits which happen once in a blue moon). Though it was replaced as the National Anthem in 1984. I'm not sure I like the one we have at the moment either. I wish Australia didn't have someone else's Queen. We have for the most part nothing to do with the UK. Unfortunately the referendum in 1999 shows a majority (around 60% of Australia) still want the monarchy. Doesn't help that the white Australia Policy was only abolished in 1973 and official Anti-Discrimination laws only came into place in 1975, so many of the older generation have British roots. I think we just have to wait for those who like the monarchy to pass on. 

Some people want to move forward, but a lot of people like to have a firm hold on the past. 




 That's awesome. I have a genuine respect for EeePCs. Especially how good value for money they are. It did everything I expected and more, and the build quality was excellent.

As long as you back up the data then even if you break it after being a bit rough (which I generally am with things), you can get a new one for cheap. Not that it will break that easily though...

I'd recommend checking out the new EeePC's too.  




 Prouds is okay. Better on sale. 




 What did you do to it? 

Do you put it into sleep/hibernate while you move it around? Cause if not that's not too good for most hdds. 

I have an Asus EeePC 1000H. I literally dropped it down the stairs (in sleep mode) and it's still working 2 years after the incident. 

If you're really rough maybe you should consider a Toughbook or at least get a laptop with a ssd. 

 




 It's his brother from another mother! 




 Thanks :) Sucks a few little sections are missing in a few key spots in the video, but I have a better understanding now. 




 Also dowels are a key ingredient for making meth. 




 This is pretty cool, though I wish you could have the option of continuing to display the images after changing the text. 




 He did say really fast train, though the train in his picture is not very aerodynamic. And also it's powered by steam... possibly magic steam. 




 That sucks. Are electricity prices up for you too? I get a quarterly bill and my electricity cost is double what it was for the same quarter last year. I think I've used a bit more electricity but I don't think I've used double.  




 I like pictures with movement and personality! Kinda reminds me of a [galah](http://www.mariannedepierres.com/wp-content/uploads/galah.jpg) but not pink. 




 The first argument brought up at least 5 times in this article point to women only being after money. Sure, there may be some women like that but there are also plenty that are not. 

The second main argument is that women want to crush their husbands hopes and dreams. Seriously? Firstly it's not going to be deliberate in most cases - you wouldn't marry someone with the intention of making them unhappy. Secondly, we all have decisions to make and being in a relationship means considering their wife and kids. Just like for a wife, being in that relationship means considering their husband and kids. If you aren't willing to make those compromises then yes, you shouldn't be in a relationship regardless of whether you are a man or a woman. However there is so much to gain from a loving relationship, so you have to decide what's more important to you.

The third thing I take issue with is that the poster implies that he shouldn't need to pay child support. Maybe sometimes the amounts are unfair, and if that is the case I see the point, but why shouldn't both parents be equally involved in the upbringing of their kids? 

If you really have this hatred for marriage then maybe it is best you don't marry. I wouldn't want to be in a relationship with someone that resented me. 




 I was wondering how you would remove these things, and thought this was relevant:

http://www.cyber-nook.com/water/Solutions.html

Maybe if you combine a certain types of filters with boiling it would be fine (or maybe you can just use a filter - not too sure). 

As that site says, depends where you live and what type of contaminants are in your water.  




 Maybe if she stands on a chair it would work. 




 I was wondering though, if you were in Johannesburg would you be safe carrying that type of equipment around? Would people still take that risk? I feel like you could just get mugged at any time there. 




 I liked the video. 




 He looks like he just ate a whole business of flies! So full! 




 The CBD is okay but a bit more expensive not only in terms of rent, but groceries, bars/drinks. Of course it is probably more convenient if that is where you are going to be working. 

In Glebe you don't have to get the tram, and personally I wouldn't unless you need to be in the city in a hurry and work along one of the tram stops (because it's expensive and it doesn't go right down into the more central parts of the city like Town Hall/Wynyard). The buses are a bit slow   busy during peak hour though I will admit - especially if you are catching the ones that go up Glebe Point Road. I think if you work in the city from Glebe, walking or biking is probably the best option (  cheapest). You can walk straight through Pyrmont and be in the city in around 30-40 mins (approx 3-4km walking). The bus is fine for most other times (rainy/cold/dark days) and taxis are usually $20 if you have a night out and miss the last bus. 

Some of the other areas suggested are good too though, but it depends on what you're after exactly. 




 Not to say it doesn't happen - but I've never heard of anyone getting typing strain (that I know). Is there anyone here who has?

I find my problem is not that I can't type fast enough but that I can type faster than I can think... stupid brain! 




 I go in the shower and blow my nose into my hands and then wash it off. I find the hot steamy water loosens it up so it comes out freely.  




 Tilt your head to the right and look at it. 




 It can! Apparently!

 Me too! My mum used to be a typist on a typewriter for the railways. Does your mum press the buttons real hard and deliberately? I saw another lady on a public computer in the shops once and she typed like my mum and I think she might have been a typist too!  




 Yeah it's always hard because even if they don't intend to hurt you they sometimes do because, well, they're people. And it's often people you are close to as well that hurt you the most because they're the ones whose words and actions you care about. :( *Hugs* 

The result won't always be the same though. It sounds like it turned out badly this time, but it won't always be that way. You actually sound like a really strong person in that you are clearly trying hard and you have overcome a lot of things to get to the point you're at. It might be good to lower your expectations a little, take things a little slower, and of course give yourself a break if you need it, but don't give up on what you want. You will get there. 




 Your comment reminded me of [this](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=depressions-evolutionary) article.  




 Did something happen today? 

It sounds like you're trying really hard to make your life better - don't give up. It's a difficult thing to do but you can do it. 




 I like the ones that are slapped on haphazardly. Goes with their parking style. 




 Yeah I'd go for lazy as well. He probably should have put in a little bit of effort thinking up a better excuse though. 




 Lol yeah, on the way to the zoo I saw some rednecks and thought we were already there. 




 It was for a conference. It was a pretty strange place to go for my first trip there but I didn't mind it! The zoo there is pretty good for a little place in the middle of nowhere. 




 I met another Australian on a plane once while I was there who did it. He said his experience involved a bunch of kids whose parents have too much money, neglect them and want to send them away for the summer. He was saying he didn't really like it that much. But I'm sure there are people who experience it differently. 




 I'd like to see an American do this on a world map. 




 That's true about that. I used to think I'd like the technology there, cause when I was in primary school I had a friend who went there and she told me all about how everything was automatic. But when I got there none of that really impressed me, but I was incredibly impressed with the Grand Canyon. I was also impressed with Niagara Falls, tho I would have been more impressed if I could feel my extremities. 




 I didn't know it was about the politicians! Actually I didn't even know it was called the windy city until I was coming down for landing in the plane and it was really turbulent. That's when the guy next to me told me about it being the windy city. Felt like it made sense at the time.  




 My first destination in the US was Omaha!  




 Thanks! That is awesome. I didn't know about old versions of magazines on Google Books.

Also look at page 168. Made me laugh.  




 I managed to dig up some information that shows people are trying to do something to help those who have been attacked:
http://www.newser.com/story/35103/pakistani-salon-hires-fire-acid-attack-victims.html
 Pakistani women disfigured by acid and fire attacks have found a second lifeas beauticians, the AP reports. The head of a well-known Pakistani salon chain discovered 5 years ago how commonly women are maimed by crazed or spurned lovers. With the aid of an Italian surgical nonprofit, she has helped many heal and put them to work.

Yet victims outnumber the jobs: 33 Pakistani women were singed by acid attacks and another 45 set on fire last year.


(On a side note, it's good they can work, but wouldn't working in a beauty salon be pretty depressing for them?)
 

And to prevent future attacks in Pakistan:
http://www.ethicsinaction.asia/archive/2010-ethics-in-action/vol.-4-no.-1-february-2010/acid-attacks-a-serious-concern-in-pakistan
 On 26 January 2010, a bill regarding acid violencewhich would specifically target acid related crimes by providing graver punishments for the attackers and by regulating the sale and purchase of acidwill be submitted to the National Assembly of Pakistan. But this only marks the beginning of a long legislative process and it will require some time before the law is successfully adopted and effectively enforced. It will also require a strong political will, which until now, has proven inadequate, if not nonexistent. Indeed, in most of those cases, the judicial institutions have not taken stern sanctions against the perpetrators, which have often been able to walk away in total impunity. Nor has adequate compensation and support been granted to the victims.


And there are new proposed laws in some other countries like Cambodia:
http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2010021632077/National-news/acid-attacks-could-earn-life-in-prison.html
 AUTHORITIES will explore legislating stiff new punishments for perpetrators of acid crimes as part of measures aimed at quelling an apparent jump in reported incidents of the violent attacks, officials said Monday.

The proposal, issued earlier this month after a string of acid attacks, is among options being evaluated by a new government committee charged with decreasing acid attacks by controlling its use.
 
 Ouk Kimlek, secretary of state at the Ministry of Interior and deputy director of the committee, said authorities will discuss parts of a draft 20-point law during a meeting Thursday, including life sentences for those convicted in the most severe attacks.

In drafting the law, the important point that I noted is punishment on people who use acid against someone to make them become handicapped, damage their beauty, or kill, Ouk Kimlek said. They will be sentenced to jail for their whole lives. If the victim is just lightly injured, then there will be a sentence of five or more years in jail.


I guess there is a long way to go still though, and even with current laws there are so many other obstacles to getting someone convicted for their crimes, and even more difficult to stop them from happening in the first place. But I am glad to see people are trying to do something.


 




 There is one outside Broadway shopping center just down from Oportos (on Parramatta Road side towards the city) that I go to that is reasonable (I think like $30 for a womens haircut - not sure how much for a guys but I have seen men there whenever I'm there getting their hair cut too). If you're looking for it you will notice it's got mostly asian women staff. Or you can try Just Cuts in Broadway shopping center - that one is not too bad.

I went to some others in the shops and they were okay (I think $60) but one of them did a head massage, and personally I don't like it because it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. 




 That is quite a walk. I have been taking my lunch and walking to work and I actually feel a sense of achievement by not spending anything unnecessary, but it does sometimes make me a bit tired. 




 So many women must feel like they have no options without being allowed to have an education. And those in the article who had the courage to make their own choices are more than severely punished for doing so. I wonder what sort of life they will live after an acid attack when an education is not allowed. What sort of job they will get to support themselves. I also didn't realise the number of women this was inflicted upon. I had heard of it before but thought it was rare. Very sad. 




 I think I am the same like that. I like 'testing' out ideas, but actually implementing them and going into that sort of detail doesn't really interest me either.

I like art too and I've always found it easy to come up with good ideas, but my technique sucks. In high school I came up with this idea and I went about painting it. One of my friends who is reknowned for copying other people's ideas did it as well. Only she painted it way better than me, and I will be the first to admit that. My idea was there but my skills aren't up to scratch. It might just be a matter of practice and finding time to do it. I went to Tasmania a couple of years ago and went for a bushwalk and noticed heaps of guys in the bush painting. It looked really enjoyable and relaxing, and I thought maybe one day I will do that.  




 What makes you tick, where do you want to be, what makes you happy at work, leisure or at other times?

At work I like to discover new things or create something new and see what I find. I like improving things. 

My home time is much the same. For example, when I had time I liked gardening cause I could be creative and pick what I wanted to do with the space and then make it happen and the results looked nice. I like creating new things too and trying new things, though I don't always finish what I start if I find something better to do.

My leisure time ideally involves being around trees or water or getting involved in nature-based activities like surfing or snowboarding, and I love that it's always different and I find it really relaxing. Oh I guess I like sports generally that involve some kind of challenge, not like jogging straight but a team sport is good. 




 I actually socialise a lot with different groups of people, but if I make too many plans I can feel myself screaming inside wanting to have my own time to be alone doing things that I enjoy. It's not that I don't like people. I just also like my freedom, and when I am around people I have to be considerate of them, and can't just always do whatever I want. 




 I like constructive criticism but encouragement would easily work better on me. That said, I think that's the same for most people. 




 Generally I have poor focus but once I am interested in something I have excellent focus (particularly at the last minute).

I found my lack of focus a problem in lectures at uni until I started trying to think of questions to ask for everything. I'd try to answer them in my head or look them up and if I couldn't find the answer I'd ask the lecturer. It helped keep my mind a bit more engaged. This applies to everything now. I don't have too many problems focusing. 




 I'm an analyst programmer too! But only for the last 2 years. Before that I did research. I preferred the amount of control I had over my work before compared to what I have now. 

I can't accept things for the way they are and go about my daily business, I have to always be improving things and making things better. I like researching about something, learning about new things, and putting my own ideas into things and testing them. I am hoping I've picked the right career but I can't think of anything else I could be doing right now anyway.
 









 I do sometimes, and then I lick it! 




 A) I agree. I don't mind pressing the flush button as long as I don't have to press the tap or door handles when exiting the bathroom. I appreciate a sink with a foot pedal like in Italy, or a sensor. 

C) We don't have many of those self-flushing toilets in Australia, but I didn't like them when I was in the US because I kept trying to do a poo and while I am a novice at self flushing toilets, the sensor kept thinking I wasn't there and flushing while I was pooing, splashing my bum which was gross. I didn't like that :( Is there a way to stop them from flushing against your will? 




 I am a fully grown adult and I want that book now. 




 I guess the intended meaning of the idiom is that 'it's not fair to judge apples and oranges by the same criteria', rather than it being impossible. Therefore I think that the idiom 'you can't compare apples and oranges' to be a bit vague and misleading, because you *can* compare them, on a variety of properties such as price, taste and color for example, even though, as you pointed out, it may not be fair to do so. 

Nevertheless, we do it all the time with everything. We have to in order to differentiate between things and make decisions. 

Ref: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apples_and_oranges

On a related note, I think that when you make a statement about your taste in art you can acceptably say 'I prefer this artist over the other artist' but you cannot definitively say that 'This artist is better than the other artist' because you are in a way suggesting that everyone feels the same way. Whether an artwork is 'better' to you really depends on how that artist has satisfied your taste preferences, which may not be the same as someone elses. So to be specific you would have to say 'According to my criteria for preference of art, this artist is better than the other artist'... or something like that anyway... 




 Why can't I compare apples and oranges? 




 Eat healthy food and try to get enough sleep. I was repeatedly sick for ages and didn't know how much difference a good diet and enough rest could make until I did it. Difference is huge.  




 I don't think I could stand just working for the future. I want to enjoy my life along the way. 









 I have been feeling this way too recently. Sometimes I find it really hard, and for a while I make progress but then there's moments where I feel like I just got reeled back to where I started. You just have to have faith that things will get better, even if you can't see that sometimes.

For now, it might not feel so great but just give yourself time, don't worry about how long it's taking, just let up on yourself a bit. This is how I have been trying to cope.

Firstly, stop worrying about the distant future so much. Concentrate on today, and making every day count. Think - what can you do today that will make you feel better? What is a positive step you can make to make the next week/month more bearable? (just to be clear I don't mean drugs or alcohol)

Next, I don't know if this works for everyone but I always give myself some time to grieve, say like 5-15 minutes or sometimes longer, whatever it takes to feel like enough. The, after I have sulked I force myself to move on and do something else. No use sulking for hours. You have to let it out but you also have to realise sometimes you're just going overboard. 

Third, don't look at other people and compare yourself. Everyone leads a different life. A lot of my friends got married quite young and I am still not. I don't see myself as a lesser person, I just chose to spend a lot more time at university and so I'm just not at that stage yet. I don't really care what they do, my life isn't about what they do, it's about me. It's up to you if you want to hang out with them but if it's making you feel worse maybe you can set yourself a time limit for seeing them so you can cope with it better. 

Finally, think about what you want in life. Start with short term goals. Things that will make you feel a bit better today, tomorrow, this week. Then when you feel like you can cope day to day, think about the rest of the month, then the next year. See how you go with that. 

As for the girl, every time you think about her force yourself to think of something else that you like instead. She has obviously moved on and you need to as well. It's not going to help you to think about it all the time.

Everything takes time, but if you spend so much time sulking and feeling crap it will be hard for you to make progress and for things to feel/get better. These things might not make you feel better straight away but keep trying and hopefully every day things will get just a little bit easier.

 




 :( Hug? 
























 Any suggestions?   




 How old is everyone in this thread? You think now is bad? There was a time things were much much worse with our rail system... it's actually pretty good now in comparison.  




 Also I heard someone say once that the employees who are happiest are the ones who know they are learning skills and could get another job... and so they are less likely to leave their current job.  




 What did you do before and what do you do now? I have also been considering a career change. 




 They're making some interesting Big Macs. 




 My bus is always packed and it would be completely unreasonable to expect someone to get off at a particular door. You always go to the one that is closest. 

There are no real rules on buses except I think most people try to be nice to each other. It's bad enough we have to cram into a tube with 50-70 other people. We are all probably not that happy about it.  

Really the worst thing for me is when someone really stinks badly and there is nowhere else for me to move to. It's probably the only thing that will make me get off a bus and wait for the next one.  




 Yeah I've also noticed there are a lot of devs that have done a masters degree here and got a job after that.  




 Try applydirect.com.au too - I no longer apply to recruiters. For me it is a waste of time.  




 Our company is in a niche area and we hire heaps of people from overseas. Actually as an Australian I am in the minority here. If you're not in a niche then I agree it is probably difficult. A lot of people I know from the UK have already been employed by companies like pwc and then it was an internal transfer within their company to Australia. 




 One interview I went to the guy asked for my current pay and then said "oh, I thought it would be less than that" and I was on like $12 an hour. 




 Ah. Maybe my great aunt was just really weird then lol 




 If it helps, my mum's aunt was very traditional British and wanted my mum to return to England to marry her cousin. My great aunt didn't understand why that was wrong either. But at the end of the day my mum made her own decision (not incest obviously!). 

It must be frustrating but I suppose the best you can do is talk to your parents and ask them not to stereotype and  guide your daughter to help her make her own mind up about what she likes or doesn't like. 




 Me and my sister played with mud and foil tins. No we weren't poor. We just liked it. :) I feel as though kids toys are overly complicated these days. Maybe it's good to have a mix. 




 I can understand why grandparents might do that though. They grew up in a very different world. Not saying they should just that they don't see how it's insane. 




 Mine were like that too. I had each side done while awake. The first side went very well. Second side I got dry socket. Has to be among the worst pain I have experienced in my life. I drugged myself up and tried to sleep through it for a few days. 




 Did they have to shoot it? Would it be possible to just cut its horns? 




 I loooove their cakes. My favourite is the blackforest cake. David Jones at Elizabeth St also has a really good one!  




 What is your favorite way to pay tax? 




 If you need to take something with you like lunch and it's stored in the fridge, put your keys on top of it and you won't forget to take it.  




 Set aside some time by yourself with nothing planned. You can just do whatever you feel like doing at the time and live life in the present. Making plans sometimes means doing stuff you don't feel like doing just because you planned it.  




 Stretch when you first wake up in the morning. I don't mean just wave your arms about and yawn, I mean really try to stretch all the major muscles. You will feel a lot better the rest of the day. 




 Before you leave work each day write a list of things you need to do the next day. This lets you leave work at work and stop wasting time when you get to work in the morning. 




 A beautiful scenic shot taken on one of my trips with my loved ones in it. The scenery because I would miss the vast open spaces and it would remind me of a trip that I enjoyed and give me hope for more. And loved ones because it would remind me I have people worth living for and it would remind me that I'm a person who other people care about.  




 I think our service is a bit shitty though generally unless it's a top class restaurant. Even then sometimes it's hit and miss. Although I prefer not having to pay tips I think having to earn it would mean service would be better. 




 You should have the nicest stuff first. It tastes even nicer when you're properly hungry. 




 Hehe I hadn't seen this. This was great. :) 




 My mum told me when I was younger flossing was bad for your gums and I believed her. I just had $4000 worth of dental work with another $6000 needed. Floss dammit!! 




 That is a stupid rule anyway. If I care about someone I will tell them things they might not find nice but need to hear. Timing is important. It's like someone got the timing wrong once, then this rule was made up. 




 It's great you two are motivating each other. My partner and I are doing the same... though we're not ready for obstacle courses yet. And you and your partner look great. The hard work has really paid off :) 




 I feel like this too. We really had the best of both worlds. I was always on the computer but when I wasn't I was out with friends or riding my bike or at the beach. 




 I used to like going to the library and using paper, pens and books. There was a study area when I went to uni in the early 2000s which just consisted of desks with space for your books. They replaced it and now there are just computers everywhere. I used to like that the library was a place to kind of focus without the distractions that you have on a computer or laptop. 




 Tell that to the humans. 




 I'll be honest, and I am ashamed of it now - I was initially not a fan of the cycling lanes in Sydney's CBD. When they were first being built people weren't using them and I felt they didn't really go anywhere. While some of that was true in construction, it was incredibly ignorant and short-sighted. There has been such a great acceptance and uptake of those bike lanes, I wonder how I could have ever had that opinion now. 

I questioned why I felt this way and I decided to give cycling in the city a go (albeit on a weekend because I am scared of being run down by crazy cars). It was great. I don't enjoy riding on the roads but with the cycling lanes it feels a lot safer and I really could enjoy it a lot. I even started riding to work. 

I think people don't like cyclists mostly because they haven't done it, and they are ignorant and selfish. I'll admit that is exactly what I was at the time, and it was wrong. 

I have seen both bad cyclists and bad drivers, but I feel that the attitudes in Sydney at least towards the bike paths and cyclists are slowly changing. I think with more good bike paths that will help as more people start trying them out and taking it up. 

There is one thing I still have a gripe with and that is those lay-down bikes with the little flag (I think they're called Recumbent Bikes). I saw a guy nearly get run over by a truck riding one of those down through the city centre on the non-bike lanes. They're impossible for cars to see, and he's almost asking for whatever fate happens to him.   




 Wash your feet in warm water. I always feel better all over if my feet feel nice and clean. 




 I saw this on the plane and there weren't any subtitles. :(

 Where does milk come from?

He was 19. I thought he was joking and then he explained seriously he thought it was made in a factory. 

We thought we'd better not tell him where eggs come from. 




 There are ways to get cheaper tickets tho. You can get $10 Hoyts tickets through Optus. And I think Telstra does Greater Union tickets for about the same.

 That makes sense but then I was thinking about 2 core processors or 6 core. They're not square either. I think you're onto something though. It could be about how common circuitry can be shared between cores. 

I was thinking the base is square so the fan can sit on top neatly. And fans have to be round. 




 Could it be related to the temperature? It is one of the less obvious reasons for sleeping issues. [Source]( http://www.sleepfoundation.org/article/how-sleep-works/the-sleep-environment). 




 My guess is that it's the way information is stored and processed. 

Binary encoding for data representation is made of bits. A bit is an on/off state which can be used to perform calculations. If you use a larger number of bits for example you can start representing numbers. For example 0101 in binary is 0x2^(3) + 1x2^(2) + 0x2^(1) + 1x2^(0) which gives you the number 5. 

Most of the time processors are built for even number 8, 16, 32, 64 bit length calculations. I think this is because the length of a byte is 8. Why is it 8 bits? It was just what was popular at the time.

Source: [here]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte)

So my guess is that it grew from those origins and they stuck with the even number theme. 




 Two main reasons:
1. High Sugar 
2. High Caffeine and/or Other Stimulants


When you eat sugar, your body tries to regulate itself. It does this by causing the pancreas (an organ in your body that makes digestive enzymes to break down your food) to produce a hormone called insulin which helps your body absorb the sugar and turn it into energy or else store it for later use. When you have a lot of sugar, the pancreas tries to produce more insulin to cope. But doing this often can damage the pancreas and over time it can no longer function properly and can't produce enough insulin. Poor insulin creation or absorbtion is a condition called diabetes. If left untreated, all this extra sugar floating around in your blood causes your blood vessels to harden and this can lead to a bunch of nasty conditions like kidney failure, heart attacks, blindness, nerve damage, etc. 

Source: [here](http://www.webmd.com/diabetes/how-sugar-affects-diabetes?page=2)
and for more information on the 2 types of diabetes see [here](http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/medicine/insulin/diabetes-insulin.html)


Sugar is also terrible for your teeth, and its presence causes the acidity in your mouth to increase as you break down the sugar. When the acidity level in your mouth increases, it eats away at the enamel of your teeth, causing tooth decay. 

Source: [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/health/the-mouths-guard.html?_r=0)


Not to mention if you are having a lot of sugar all the time you are likely to be eating more than your daily required intake of Calories/kilojoules and become overweight, which can lead to a number of other health issues. 


Caffeine can actually be good in small doses, as it stimulates your central nervous system and causes your heart rate to increase. It is also a diuretic (makes you need to go to the bathroom). A high heart rate can be useful when you need increased mental alertness but it can be bad if you are trying to sleep. It can also have other side effects such as headaches and vomiting if in really high doses. Large amounts of caffeine can also reduce calcium absorbtion and can increase your chance of developing osteoporosis (thin bones). 

If caffeine is not present they use other stimulants like guarana to have the same effect. 

Also when these stimulants are combined with alcohol they can mask how drunk you are, so you are likely to drink more than you might otherwise.

 Maybe it depends on what you're doing at those times. The hormone Melatonin is released at night causing you to feel sleepy, but it is affected by the amount of light. Maybe if you are in front of a light source, it is disrupting what you body expects to be its daily pattern or circadian rhythm.  




 Here is another one - I tried using lightroom also on the modified photo to add in some vignetting so the edges are darker: http://imgur.com/BdY29kZ 




 It's tough because there is so much noise in the photo I blurred it out a bit to make it less noticeable. I have tried sharpening it again but it just adds the graininess back in and it didn't look so great. See here: http://imgur.com/5c1dO9w

I just tried increasing the contrast - this might be a little bit better - it doesn't look as blurry: http://imgur.com/jrQ0XNQ

Maybe someone else on reddit can help? 




 How do you get rid of the bumps like that? I have a couple of photos of my own that I want to do that for. 




 How's this? http://imgur.com/9OMpZki 




 Are the grey clouds meant to be there or was there a spill on the photo? 




 I think that is the same here in Australia. I love Pepsi Max but I can't drink it because it makes me need to pee really badly. No other cola does that to me. I chose it at first because it was cheaper than Coke but now I'm onto caffeine free Pepsi Light. 




 Yeah it's probably a last resort option though. Turia Pitt was competing in a Marathon and she was trapped by a grass fire so she ran back through the flames. She survived though.

 Your minimum wage is $7.25? Is that federal? Ours is a little higher but then our cost of living is pretty high too, especially in Sydney. 
http://www.fairwork.gov.au/pay/national-minimum-wage/Pages/default.aspx 




 I'm not sure if it's directly related, but we often don't have the best service in Australia though. I read somewhere that it's due to changes in formal waitstaff training offerings, but having tips as an incentive must help too. 




 I wanted to save it. I mean that thing has got to be like 1000 years old. But when it started charging at us we had to put it down. :( I am sad but relieved at the same time. 


Edit: I'm sorry for the nightmares! They're actually pretty cool spiders (they kill other pesky insects), and they aren't that poisonous but I just don't like them in my bedroom anymore.

Last time I had one almost as big as this in my bedroom I let him be for 3 days. He didn't move at all so I thought it was fine. But on day 4 I came in the door and he actually charged towards me. I don't think he wanted to be friends anymore... 




 He was sitting right above my bed - actually had to get up on the bed to get him. As soon as we went in the door with the container to trap him he reared up ready for attack. I thought he might run and hide behind the picture, but as we got closer he climbed up onto the tiger picture with both front legs up ready for a fight. By the way, for reference the picture is 32cm (12.5") wide. So he must have been about 8-10cm wide including legs. One of the biggest huntsman I've ever seen.  









 [This guy](http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/askville/4725073_55886428_mywrite/2100734030047620693wapafafs.jpg) 




 I try not to worry about what everyone else is doing. As long as you are doing what you want to do, and if you want these other things, then as long as you are making an effort to go get them, then hopefully things will fall into place when the time is right for you. 




 I had a collie rough growing up and I swear he understood every word when I would talk to him about all my troubles. He would come right up and nudge me and I'd hug him, and I would never feel alone as long as he was there.  




 Cool. I found it in the SAS Survival Guide (little pocket book which is great to carry around): http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/295358.SAS_Survival_Guide 




 According to my survival book, you can obtain it from some plants such as the roots of hickory trees in North America or of the nipa palm in southeastern Asia. Boil the roots until all the water evaporates and black salt crystals are left.

If no direct salt sources are available then you can get it second hand through animal blood. 




 The Cronulla riots happened over 7 years ago now. I wish we could all move on from it.  




 How did you go with this? Is it still leaking? 




 It's bizarre isn't it? I know of plenty of organisations and people that still use faxes and it pretty much always surprises me.  




 We have had a lot of these in my mum's backyard lately. They have been feeding on caterpillars and getting really fat while breeding (I keep finding lots of egg sacs near the spiders I find). I kill them when I see them but they mostly just try to run and hide in crevices. I always feel bad killing spiders because they are sorting out much worse insects in my backyard like flies. Still, they make me feel uncomfortable.

I actually left a huntsman in my bedroom for a few days because I know they're pretty harmless but one day I walked into my room and it reared up and started running towards me. That was the end of our relationship. 




 I just use white vinegar and it works really well, it's cheap and safe for the environment. Also it doesn't scrape off any layers of paint that I am aware of. 




 TIL about lava soap. We have something similar - orange scrub: http://www.septone.com.au/detail.asp?item_cat= item_number=31 page_num=2 
Smells like oranges too. 




 Well, the best water level is water. :) Gotta make sure those hedges are trimmed to perfection! When the water level goes down, it's the first thing people will notice. 




 Good thing they had their headlights on or they wouldn't have been able to see where they were going!!

 Someone needs to make a book of best-of reddit posts for deperate redditors for when there are internet outages. I'd do it but I'm busy reading reddit at the moment.  




 There's been more information on the Townsville Bulletin website and some updates are [here](http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2013/01/28/374359_news.html). The emergency services numbers have been on ABC 24 all day, but without details of where/why etc.  




 I went to a restaurant (Mad Pizza yum) yesterday and we ordered wood fired pizzas and pasta. The air con in that place wasn't working too well. We sat in there wiping off our sweat with napkins. I kept looking in the kitchen. Really felt bad for that poor guy in there with the pizza oven. But the food was good :) 




 It was in the Shire not Western Sydney and it was a long time ago. Probably in the 90's. Maybe 20 years ago now. 

There are really only two hot years I remember out of probably many - the one when my goldfish died, and the one when a whole lot of my neighbours lost their houses and were sitting in our street with their cars full of whatever they could grab as they had to abandon their homes.

Anyway - Sucks to be in Western Sydney right now!!  




 I was only a little kid and it was almost an extra room of the house with walls on 3 sides, and normally when it's not that hot the fish is fine... just not on that day. I realised about half way through the day and went to get him to bring him inside but it was too late :(  




 I wonder if jogging on a day like today would even begin to give you an idea of how hot a firefighter gets when they're fighting a bushfire. 

I mean there are firefighters out there right now - so I suppose it must feel a thousand times hotter in their suits, with the heat from an actual fire on top of the heat that is hotter than the city. Not to mention more life threatening. They deserve a lot of respect. 

* Edit - wanted to include a pic of firefighters fighting fires in Western Sydney (Penrith) today:
http://images.smh.com.au/2013/01/18/3963493/DA-BDO-20130118160305578810-600x400.jpg

 No but it stopped! But soon there will be thunder and lightning and more rain... If you trust bom. 




 The hottest day I remember in Sydney before this was 44C. There might have been hotter days before or after that but I remember because it was the day I forgot about my goldfish outside on the patio and the water boiled. Rip fishy. :-(  




 I had so many people tell me that and now ten years on, I can tell you that at least for me high school was the worst years of my life and I am so damn grateful those years are over. If you're in highschool don't believe it. It might be true for some people, but it's not a blanket rule. My life is so much better now. 









 Thanks. I've done a little bit more. I don't know how much more time I would be willing to spend on it as there is a lot of work involved but perhaps someone else would like to give it a go. Here's the results of what I've done:

I can't really fix the boy's face as it would require redrawing it as there is so much missing, so I've left the tear over it. Maybe with another picture someone can help you out.

I'm also kind of new at this so I don't really know how to get rid of the green without losing too much photo quality. I did my best.

Good luck! 




 I did a bit of work on their faces but I need to go to sleep now: http://imgur.com/CIfkd
I'll see what I can do tomorrow.

Btw, the boy second from the left is going to be a little bit difficult to reconstruct because of how much of his face is missing. Do you have any other photos of him? 




 Do you have a higher resolution scan? That would be really helpful. There is quite a lot of damage to the photo. 




 haha this one made me laugh. :) 




 No problem :) Glad I could help!  




 http://i.imgur.com/gSxGv.jpg - I think this came out pretty well.

For those who are doing something on it still, this was my first attempt: http://i.imgur.com/xkY9N.jpg
I tried to reduce the white flare on the left a bit so the photo is more even. 
Then it wasn't quite even on the right, so I've used j00jy's version and created a multiply layer to even out the flare on both sides and got the above.

By the way, I'm really sorry to hear about your cousin :(  









 Yeah I like the Australian Reptile Park better cause it's less crowded and some of the animals like kangaroos and emus roam freely, and they have nicer enclosures than both the zoo and the city one, but the downside is that it's also far if you're a tourist. I really like the Galapagos tortoise, the croc enclosure and the Tassie devils there. I guess koala park or featherdale could be another option, but not sure as I haven't been there since I was a little kid. Taronga zoo is ok for Australian animals too. The koala enclosure is good as you can walk up and view them from a high platform, and they have a few small crocs. I don't remember anything about being able to hold them though. Apparently [govt regulations don't allow it anymore](http://taronga.org.au/animalencounter) . They do have a walk around section now you mention it which was pretty good. 
 




 I agree with everything you said! My ring is not 3 months salary but is so amazing. He designed it and picked the stones himself at a family jeweller. To me it is perfect. I have the most beautiful engagement ring. I've since seen ones with bigger price tags and would never trade. You know what really makes it extra beautiful is not the ring itself but what it represents and more importantly who it comes with :) That's what I think of whenever I see it... not the price tag.  




 - Taronga Zoo
- Sydney Harbour/The Rocks
- You should probably go to at least one beach (Bondi is the most touristy, Manly is where all the expats live, Coogee is another city beach option). Manly has an arts   crafts market on Sunday (http://www.ourmanly.com.au/Travel/manly-markets.aspx).
- Sydney is known for markets, depending on how much you like markets there are just so many... [This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_markets_in_Sydney) is not a bad list but the best for tourists (near the city) are probably Paddy's Markets near Central Station, The Rocks market, Manly Arts   Crafts and Paddington Markets. Don't get all market-ed out though. They are not all places to get a bargain - some, like the Rocks and Paddington Markets can be expensive.
- Harbour Bridge climb is an option (costs $$ but I hear it's good), or if you prefer you can just walk across it for free.
- Visit some kind of national park and go walking - There are some good ones around the city, but if you want the real bush then you need to go to a bigger one and you need a car to get there - for example The Royal National Park or Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park. If you're really keen then you could also go to the Blue Mountains. There's some WW2 gunner stations at Mosman which are interesting to walk around, and have a great view. Again though, not easy to get to without a car.
- Go to some sort of wildlife park - especially if you're not from Australia. One that is easy to get to is the Reptile Park in the city next to Sydney Aquarium. They have crocs and other Australian animals there.
- While you're there you may as well go to the acquarium. It's not bad, they have penguins and stuff.
- You could do a harbour lunch cruise - try get a deal (like on ouffer or something) and it should cost you about $50 for lunch on a cruise boat.

There's probably more things I could suggest, but that's all I have off the top off my head right now. 




 I agree with the others about the salary being decent.

Off topic slightly, but related to income... Check out this page about LAFHA (Living Away From Home Allowance) - it could be useful:
http://www.lafha.com.au/Employees.aspx

There's been some changes in this year's budget in relation to it, due to people abusing the system, but I think (depending on the sort of visa you get) you can still get it. I know most people at my company have LAFHA payments, as we have a lot of staff coming from overseas due to our skills shortage. Check out the bottom of that page for more details. There's probably some more stuff on expat forums as well you could search for. 




 My cat had pretty long fur and had really bad fleas once and was running around biting random objects and jumping around like she was on fire. I had to give her a bath to get rid of some fleas and then we put her on flea medicine after that. Probably should have done that in the first place.

 My husband started going for evening walks with me. He is a good listener so just listens to me while we walk. The fresh air does me good and although I don't feel 100% it just calms me a little. It kinda makes each day just a little bit more bearable.  




 Yeah I know, just wanted to try it out to see how it was. 




 Whenever I lift up things in the garden it's always redbacks. 




 I used myGov for the first time this year. It's faster to fill out but having done my tax with e-tax for as long as I can remember it feels like I'm missing out on possible tax deductions... 

I also really missed all the useful help buttons and the depreciation calculator.  




 Thanks for sharing this. I hadn't read it before. My family has been unlucky and had lots of cancer deaths in the last 2 generations from bowel, cervical, lung and leukaemia. One aunt on each side has had breast cancer and both survived when none of the others have, so I do wish there was more funding for some of the other areas. 




 Thundamentals rocked it. They did do their brother cover! They also got a verse in Cosby Sweater along with K21 who has an amazing stage presence. Apparently the first time they've done that together on this tour. I filmed it from my phone tho its not as good as being there obviously - http://youtu.be/I-AjnIapqCY 




 I was actually at the hospital earlier this week getting a scan and the nurse was injecting a cannula into my vein to deliver the contrasting agent. 

As I'm clenching my fist waiting for a needle she turns back to me and looks at my arm and says very thoughtfully "Ahhh it's good to be young and have nice healthy veins..." and then jabs me with the needle.

My response was "uhh yeah, I guess so... I've never considered that before..."  




 I saw Hilltop Hoods last night along with K21 and Thundamentals! It was awesome. I've never been to a hip hop gig before. Love Australian music.

 I didn't know this before but oreodory fish are a bad choice of fish to eat. They are not managed well from a fisheries point of view. 

http://www.forestandbird.org.nz/what-we-do/publications/the-best-fish-guide-/fish-species-/oreos/deepwater-dory

Oh and E is bad.

"Description:Oreos are deepwater fish that are long-lived (up to 150 years) and slow growing, making them highly vulnerable to fishing pressure and overfishing. There are three commercial species in New Zealand, but they are all managed as one quota management species. They are predominantly found in deep waters off the east and south of the South Island and off the Chatham Islands. Jointly with snapper, mako shark and southern bluefin tuna, oreos have the second worst ecological ranking on the Best Fish Guide of any commercial fishery in New Zealand.

Ecological concerns:Management of the three oreo species as one, a declining stock trend, uncertainty over stock boundaries, lack of stock assessments in some areas, unknown sustainability of catch limits and lack of a management plan. Attempts to improve research in the oreo fishery have been hampered by the seafood industry challenging and preventing the Ministry of Fisheries from commissioning research surveys. 

Also of great concern is the destructive impact of deep sea trawling on seamount habitats and high levels of non target fish bycatch. There is also a bycatch of marine mammals and seabirds. 

Economic value:Key markets are the USA, Australia, Germany and Switzerland, with smooth oreo being the main market species. Exports were worth $7.47 million in 2008.

 There was a well written back story on ebola including the efforts from Samaritans Purse in our paper today: http://m.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/how-the-world-let-ebola-spread-20141007-10rh8r.touch.touch.html 




 To the people going to West Africa to help. Thank you. The truth is that so many of us are cowards - too scared for our own lives to risk them in helping others. You are the best and bravest of us. You are probably scared just like the rest of us, worrying about the moment you might make a small mistake that would be the difference between life and death, but you go anyway. You go because you believe that without you, someone might suffer and die alone. Without you, there might be no one else to care for someone who else who was unlucky enough to catch the disease. While the media continues to discuss avoidance, you know they are a person just like us - a mother, a father, a sister, a brother, a daughter or son. Instead of running away you run to those who need you most in the world. You are someone's true hero.  




 Great photos. 

One question though - how come two people didn't lift the mattress to wherever they are taking it rather than dragging it across the ground? Wouldn't that [spread any bodily fluids on the mattress](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/)?  




 I believe UNICEF are doing a range of things which include education within communities, supply of hygene products, medical supplies, medical training, protective equipment, vehicles and assisting with burial. They are also helping kids who've lost both parents to ebola and have been abandoned by their extended families to be cared for. They are training medical and support staff. 

They are a large organisation with more resources than some of the others so may not get as much specific attention, but they are doing their bit. For the record I have no preference for a particular organisation - they all need our support. I'm just hoping to provide more information here.


Some examples from http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/health/brief/world-bank-group-ebola-fact-sheet :

* World Bank Group funds have already financed a first shipment of 100 tons of essential health and hygiene supplies (worth $1.6 million), which were procured and delivered by UNICEF to Liberia on Aug. 26. Among the items in the shipment were hundreds of sets of personal protective equipment, latex gloves, thermometers, syringes, and other medical supplies to restock depleted stores at many of the countrys health facilities.

* On Sept. 5, UNICEF procured and delivered 48 tons of materials and essential drugs for Ebola treatment centers (antibiotics and other essential medicines, cannula, coveralls to protect health workers, 7,440 pairs of latex gloves, and body bags) to Sierra Leone (worth $850,000), also financed by the World Bank Group. On Sept. 17, also with World Bank Group financing, UNICEF airlifted a second delivery to Sierra Leone (worth $1.7 million), of 100 tons of drugs and equipment, including personal protective equipment, antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and chlorine.

* On Sept. 9, UNICEF procured and delivered 28 new, all-terrain vehicles to the Guinea Ministry of Health (worth $880,000). These vehicles will provide much-needed ground logistics support to treatment, supervision, contact monitoring, and burial teams working in Guinea. A second lot of vehicles will include ambulances for patient transfers and motorbikes for contact monitoring in remote, hard-to-reach villages.  

More examples from http://www.unicef.org/media/media_75900.html :

Examples of such effort by UNICEF and its partners include:

* With support from the World Bank, Japan and USAID, airlifting 544 metric tonnes of supplies to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, with almost 50 flights since early August. These supplies include protective equipment, hygiene items and essential medicines.

* Supporting the Government of Sierra Leone in conducting a three-day public awareness campaign, 19-21 September, by helping train volunteers and providing accurate information on Ebola.

* Installing water and sanitation facilities in Ebola treatment units in the three countries.

* Training community health volunteers, teachers and others and help spread life-saving information on Ebola.

* Working to avert non-Ebola disease outbreaks and provide basic services to women and children.

* Providing psychosocial support to children affected by Ebola.

Another example from http://www.unicef.org/media/media_76239.html : 

* 10 October 2014  A cargo plane with nearly 100 metric tons of essential medical supplies left Amsterdam today en route to Sierra Leone as part of UNICEFs continuing response to the Ebola outbreak ravaging parts of West Africa. Similar flights are planned for Liberia and Guinea, part of a 1 million donation from the European Commissions Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department (ECHO). Todays shipment includes protective equipment such as masks, gloves, aprons, coveralls, body bags, goggles, face shields as well as medicine and hygiene supplies to be distributed to households and health centers. This supply has been funded by donors, such as the World Bank and the UK Department for International Development (DFID). 
To date, UNICEF has flown in more than 912 metric tons of supplies to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, in what is now the largest airlift operation of Ebola supplies.

You could also look into Red Cross who are front line too:
http://www.redcross.org/news/article/Red-Cross-Opens-New-Clinic-to-Fight-Ebola-in-Sierra-Leone
I'm not sure where to go to donate to Ebola from the US site, but the Australian site has a direct donation page to the Ebola outbreak appeal:
http://www.redcross.org.au/ebola-outbreak-2014-appeal.aspx


And another is Samaritans Purse whose staff were among the first to contract Ebola, so they are front line too:
http://www.samaritanspurse.org/
You can read more about their work here:
http://www.samaritanspurse.org/article/hope-takes-flight-across-the-atlantic/
I volunteer for them every now and then when I have time. 

 




 I didn't see this but I gave money to Unicef earlier. They're a large organisation and I think they have more resources. They put a similar perceantage of your donation into field work (Not sure what it is where you are but in Australia it's 78% of the money you donate goes to field work, while doctors without borders puts about 4% more ie. 82% of the money to field work).

 Nice one. A smile is something most of us take for granted. You look so much happier now :D  




 Lol yeah. The piece of prawn was the same size as him!

 If you frame the ratings in the context of a terrorist warning system it kind of makes sense. http://www.fire.tas.gov.au/Show?pageId=colFireDangerRatings

Catastrophic = leave early

Extreme = leave early

Severe = prepare to leave early

Very high = prepare to leave

High = prepare 

Low-Medium = continue as usual
 




 If I had a piece of rubbish after leaving the office I would have to wait until I got home around 1.5 hours later to dispose of it. No bins at my city stop, 1 hour train ride, no bins at destination stop, 10 min wait for the bus, 15 min ride home, 5 min walk from bus stop. Yeah, so I'm going to leave it at the station. Because at least cleaners will usually come along and pick it up there as opposed to throwing it on the street. I suppose that makes me irresponsible but it's the truth and why my station was always littered with people's rubbish.  




 It doesn't mean people hate you though. It's hard to find people that you can connect with. It also takes a lot of time and effort to build up friendships. 

Aside from friends, do you think you could change anything to make things better for yourself?  




 You would love the big pineapple! http://lettiemusic.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/the-big-pineapple-near-nambour-queensland.jpg 




 Yeah true, but I was really referring to this particular incident, where they were driving dangerously and probably didn't mean to harm the person in the car but did as a result of their dangerous driving.  




 Well I think you only get charged with manslaughter if you actually kill someone accidentally. Otherwise you get charged with endangering someone's life.  




 If you are in Australia there is an organisation called "R U OK?". It's been around for a few years. 

They did some advertising a couple of years ago but I haven't heard anything in a while. They were trying to have a regular "R U OK? Day". 

I think it's a great idea to remind people to be there for each other.

Is there anything like that in the US and UK? 


Our next R U OK day is 11 Sept, but it's just a yearly awareness reminder to look out for other people and we should be doing that all the time. 




 I don't know if it is true for you but for me sometimes it is just my thought process and how I view the world. What someone might see in one way I see in a completely different way. 

I was told to try to capture when I am sad, unhappy, angry and so on, and try to identify the triggers. In doing that I can understand what my thought process is and potentially redirect it more positively. I am still struggling with this and need help to see the flaws in my thought process. Most of the time I am really hard on myself. I guess this is going to take time. 




 No problems at all. I hope that if I can pass on some things that have taken me years to learn about myself, maybe it will give you a different perspective and/or make it easier for you to learn about yourself. 

It took a while for me to get out of the mindset of being isolated. I am not saying to follow my path but explaining where I came from and how things changed. If I could have changed things earlier I would have had a better life sooner. 

I've always been a bit different to other people and when I was in high school and university that was really to my detriment. I was very lonely for a very long time and also very depressed. But the hurt that I suffered made me strive for a better life so that I could be independent financially and have more control over my own life. That was my #1 priority. I struggled and worked really hard to do that. I wasn't successful at first, in fact, the opposite, so I worked even harder. Years later, I got there and got the independence I wanted. You'd think by then, being successful, I would be happy right? But by this point I'd gotten into a habit of striving for perfection, and I was not at all happy with myself. I was always thinking I wasn't good enough and putting myself down in my head. Then one day it dawned on me, and I can't tell you when exactly, but it occurred to me that it's okay not to be perfect, and to remind myself that nobody is, and in accepting that I wasn't perfect and that it was okay, I could stop hating myself. And that is when I let other people in, once I could be okay with myself and not always judge myself in a negative way. It was hard at first and people did let me down occasionally but I suppose in the end I learnt my own self-worth and it made me more resilient. I am still closed off a little bit and don't let people in so easily and freely as other people but I feel comfortable at this level of disclosure. :)

What I hope you can take away from all of my lessons is that you are a worthy person. People always say "nobody's perfect" but it's become a cliche and it's almost a throwaway comment as it doesn't really matter about everyone else, 'cause we're talking about you. You're not perfect, and that's completely okay. You are a valuable person who matters. You can live your life in a way that means something to you. You do need to be careful with your trust but not completely abandon giving trust to people. How do you know who you can trust? You said you had a friend who asked about you? Well think about what's in it for him? It seems to me like probably not much, except that he cares about you and wants to make sure you're okay. If you ask yourself what's in it for the other person it can ease your mind a little bit that they don't have an ulterior motive. If you're not sure, then proceed with caution, until you have time to learn more about them. 

I know that was long winded but I hope it helps. 
 




 It could be. When people hurt you it's hard to trust anyone. Opening up is about trust because you're letting someone get to know you and you always feel there is a chance they won't like you and the rejection can hurt. Really though I think it takes a lot for someone to honestly dislike someone. The people who did that to you are mean but they're not the majority of people. I think there are more people like that in school and I'm not sure if they even really know how much they hurt others.

I think the point I'm trying to get to is trust comes in degrees. There are some people who you should be able to trust enough to talk to. From what you said it sounds like you already know who that is. Some people you need to be more wary of. I think it's important to differentiate between those people. It's hard to trust people but it's also hard to live life alone.
 
I was also hurt but in a different way and I think all the same things as you sometimes. I have changed though from isolating myself and can open up more now but I am much more selective who I trust these days. I like having people to share my life with but it's all about having the right people. I'm not compatible with everyone.  




 Sounds like a lot of stuff has been happening. Maybe it's the uncertainty and changes that are causing you to feel unsettled? 

Being around other people is different to feeling like you have companions. Sometimes I have walked through the city and seen hundreds of people but felt completely and utterly alone. I start to think it's sad and then I realise that I don't want to know them all because I like my anonymity. But then I'm alone and I want someone to be with me but not just anyone...

Whoever this person is online they don't sound good for you. Sometimes people who want something from you are the easiest to talk to but not the best. I don't know how, but try to find someone else to talk to. There are people around who will listen and not try to manipulate you while doing so.    




 What happened? :( 




 In terms of what impression you give you can't really know without asking. Even then it's a bit murky. I think you just have to reflect yourself. Think of ways other people act that you like e.g. giving compliments (if you like that) and try to do the same, and of ways people act that you don't like e.g. being too direct (again, if you don't like that) and try to avoid that. It's not really black and white - for example, most of the time I like people being fairly straightforward but the timing is important. Giving me very direct critical feedback when I'm under a lot of pressure and asking for help is possibly not the best idea. 

If you think people are intimidated to talk to you maybe it is just your manner. Do you think perhaps you could be coming across as arrogant? Or maybe just not open to continuing conversation. It's pretty hard to talk to someone who doesn't add details to the conversation or respond with questions. One thing some people do is talk about themselves but forget to talk to others or take any interest in the other person's responses. 

I'm not sure why you think you might come across as a jerk? Did someone say something to you?

Maybe you're just going through an introverted cycle. I go from being extroverted and really gaining energy from social interactions to an introvert who really loses energy from being around other people. It goes in cycles and really depends what else is going on in my life. Could this be the case with you? 




 It's good you got to talk to her. 

Maybe you need to process the depressive thoughts you have before they pop up out of the blue. I know for me if I ignore them then I actually start getting really vivid and horrible nightmares. Some have been so bad I have woken up crying or throwing up. So I have to write stuff out and try to process it while I am conscious or else the emotions come out when I don't want them to. The weird thing is sometimes I don't even feel like anything is wrong while I'm awake but I'm sure I'm stressed or anxious and I'm just suppressing it.

I mean you might have a different result than me, but maybe it could help? 




 Yeah :( I have heard other people on here mention community or church groups if you need someone to lend an ear? Sometimes it just helps for someone to listen to you so you can talk about it and process all the thoughts and feelings you are going through.  




 That sounds exhausting for him.  

If the pain is temporary I suppose just remind him that it'll be over soon. It's not a way to live but I really hope the specialists and doctors he is seeing can provide a way forward for him that isn't so debilitating. 

I don't really know what else you can say or do, except to be there. I think it means a lot to have someone there supporting him so he doesn't feel alone. 
 




 You can talk to me? 

Can you apologise to her for saying whatever you said? It sounds to me like you're genuinely sorry about it.

Was there some event that made you feel depressed or was it just sort of out of the blue? For me it's usually both :( 




 You've been through a lot and suffered a lot of hurt so I'm not surprised you are feeling low. From what you have said it sounded like you were in a toxic relationship and it's good that you have walked away from that. Nobody deserves to be treated like that. 

And also, there is no way you deserved to be raped. It's crazy that people would say that to you! They're outright wrong. 

You need to give yourself some time to process everything you've just been through. I hope you realise that however bad you feel, you deserve to live a life where you don't have to feel alone and where each day doesn't feel like a struggle. You said you moved in with your mom, can you stay there a while until you feel more stable and can start to pick the pieces up again? 




 It is terribly sad when someone dies, and knowing that the world will continue without them feels like a horrifying prospect. Some people I have lost I wonder why the world didn't just end right then, and just not bother to continue existing. 

But then I remember other people in my life, and although I am terribly stricken and sad that I have lost someone who is so important to me, I remember the other people I love and who have shown love for me and I hold onto that, and I try to be a kinder and better person for them.  




 Sites like  www.freelancer.com or www.elance.com. I think there are a few others but I can't remember their names.

There's also other things like www.airtasker.com or www.taskrabbit.com where you can do little jobs for people. 
 




 What about looking at some of the jobs on some of the online freelancing websites? They don't pay very much but then it's something you can add to your resume and it might help to show you have some initiative?  




 Wow that sucks. They sound completely unprofessional. :( 

I had a really bad one when I was younger, who gave me horrible advice. It's good you recognised this early and can walk away. 

Is there anywhere else you can go instead? Like not a different doctor, but a different facility altogether?  




 Nope. It sounds like you have been busy with other things so I don't see why that would be a problem. My first job was when I was 21 and it was at Kmart.  




 One thing that has taken me ages to accept is that it's okay to not be perfect, or even far from it. Before I was always frustrated with myself and I always felt like I would never be good enough. I don't know why, but knowing that gives me a level of confidence. 

When people reject me in interviews, I try not to take it personally, although it always is a bit. But what I try to do is to see an interview as a performance, and if I do that then it's something that I can work on, rather than it being a rejection of me as a person. If I can't find a good reason for the rejection then I blame them and convince myself that they're a company I don't want to work for anyway. :D
 




 Yeah I wish people would do that more often too. Do you have any friends or family that might know of jobs? The job I have now is because a friend recommended me.  




 The first full-time job I got took ages to get. I had an undergraduate degree but didn't have good grades. I started applying for receptionist roles because there weren't any positions in my field. When I started getting rejected from those it was really hard to take. I felt like I'd wasted years of my life and achieved nothing. But I kept trying anyway even though it felt hopeless and eventually someone gave me a chance. I think it took 6 months to get that first job. I think the first job is always the hardest because not many people are willing to take a chance. I'm so grateful to the person that gave me my first full-time job. It's not just you, it's a difficult first step. 

Oh and tips for getting a job - mainly just keep trying. Also I don't know if you have already but try to get a character reference to support your application - seeing as you have no prior non-military experience that will help. Maybe after you've been turned down by someone, try asking for feedback. Not many people are willing to give it but if they do it may help you. I don't think not having used a cash register is a good reason - maybe there was some other reason? I'm not saying to probe for it but if you reflect on the interview do you think it could it have been something else? 




 What about reading a book? Or listening to music? Or going for a jog? Watching a movie? Playing video games? Drawing? I'm not sure. Just something, anything really, to get your mind off it. Is there anything you used to enjoy doing? Maybe you could take a course or something and learn something new, and meet new people?

I guess none of us ever really learn with love. I think we all want to have someone in our lives and we can't help but keep taking those risks and even though we know it might hurt like hell, we hope that it works out - sometimes it doesn't, but then maybe you only need it to work out once.  




 I had the same thing the other day. I wanted to call but I didn't want to block up the line from people who really needed it. 

I think you just need a friend to talk to. It sounds like you have the tools to do it but need someone to lend their ear so you can reason it all out. 

If you want to chat I'm all ears. 




 It's hard looking at other people's lives and comparing yours. The thing is nobody will ever have a life just like someone else's. How do you know if someone else is going to be happy? Why aren't all those people with lots of money and a loving family happy? What about those people that seem to have it all? A lot of stuff happens that other people don't always see. 

In terms of catching up, I honestly think people are busy/lazy/preoccupied, and until they have really gotten to know you, they mightn't go out of their way to catch up. Even friends that do know each other don't catch up as they should sometimes. I know I do it sometimes, and it doesn't mean I don't care, just that I'm not perfect and I kinda suck at doing things in a timely way. It might be up to you a bit. 

One of the hardest thing for me was moving jobs and realising when I moved that all those people I thought were my friends seemed to have no interest in keeping in contact with me once I left, which felt really weird seeing as I'd seen them every day for 3 years. I even spent lunch hours talking to one girl about all her problems. The first 6-12 months after I left and joined the new company I was so lonely. I didn't have anyone to talk to and I didn't know why people didn't try to contact me, even an email, anything. I'd joined a consulting company and everyone was out on clients and too busy to talk to me, so I was basically by myself. I am on projects by myself often and I often eat alone. After a year I finally made a couple of friends though, we still aren't that close, but that's ok. I think that is going to take a long time. 

But I did contact my old work friends, and not all of them, but some of them made the time to see me. It just took me to take the initiative. After doing that a couple of times now they do ask me out sometimes. 

Would you consider trying to see the other friends again?  




 :( That is really tough. You took a risk with your heart and it hurts. If I could hug you through the internet I would. 

I suppose the best advice I can give you is to try to do things to keep your mind off of it. Sure you're going to think about it sometimes but if you're busy then hopefully not as much.  




 I think most people want to be in a relationship and be close to someone, and of course rejection hurts. If you feel hurt by that then feeling dislike towards someone else is entirely natural. 

It can be hard to find someone who is compatible with you in life. From looking at friends I have, it seems to be entirely random. It's not that one person is better than the other, it's just that things happened in their life that led them to meet this other person who also felt the same way. 

I don't think there is a secret formula to finding that person. I know a lot of people who are older and single and entirely unhappy about it, and also entirely undeserving - they're nice people - and it's not like they wanted that, just how their life turned out. What I'm trying to say I suppose is that to some extent it is out of your control, and I know this is hard to take, but you might have to figure out how to be happy with yourself and on your own before you find that other person that can make you feel complete.  




 Hey I think amp3rsand gave some good advice. 

It's going to take time to get through the grief and you don't want to have extra stress hanging over you. What's a "good" job worth if it's not good for you. 

I also think travelling could be a great idea once you have sorted out the legal stuff. Travelling made me feel free, when before that I had felt so trapped. If that's what you want to do, go for it.  




 Sorry, I should have read that from what you said. 

Well, for me, I just tried lots of different things. Some I liked, some I didn't like. I think pick one thing that is with other people, and one thing you do alone to begin with. Sometimes I like being around other people, and sometimes I really just want to be alone, so it's good having different types of things to choose from.

Some things I have done on my own are:
* I wanted to learn how to crochet, so I just bought myself a crochet needle and some wool and learnt from youtube.
* I wanted to learn how to make my hair less boring, so I got a straightening iron and learnt how to curl it on youtube. 
* I wanted to learn how to write a phone app, so I tried that out, and that's fun. It's good to see something on your phone when you get to that point. It's also something that's a bit more involved so keeps me entertained for longer and stops me from thinking too much. 
* I also really like writing, so sometimes I write stories, fiction and non-fiction. I also like writing blogs about stuff I know about and people are actually pretty grateful when you help them out with stuff. Some of my most successful blog posts have been about really simple things.

Some things I do with others are:
* I started volunteering with a friend. I don't like sitting around in cafes that much so it's good to keep yourself busy while being able to talk to your friend/s.
* I play field hockey, and it's good but it's only half a year. Still, I enjoy it. I'm no olympian, it's purely social but it's great like that. 
* Next week I'm going rock climbing with a friend. I haven't been for a very long time but I figured why not try it. I don't really think I'll like it but I'm going to go anyway and see. Sometimes I change my mind.

I guess when you find the thing you like you can invest more energy in it. I think that sort of happens naturally. And then because you invest energy in it you get better at it and it becomes your thing. 




 Hey, I'm glad you shared your story.  I read the whole thing and really feel for you.

Why did you and your girlfriend split up? 

Is there anyone else you would consider to be close in your life right now? 




 There's nothing wrong with feeling better and telling other people about it. :)  




 Beautiful. Reminds me of the waterfalls at Treble Cone a bit, but more magnificent. :)  




 Is there anything you enjoy doing right now? 




 I don't think happy is the right word, but yeah, better for having talked about things.  




 Have you tried the Google Translate app? Apparently you can take a photograph and it will translate the text in the photograph for you. I haven't really tried it but you sound like a good tester! :) There is another one called Photo Translate. 

It sucks that the expat community wasn't nice to you. I heard sometimes it's better to help you integrate into a community to try to make friends with locals anyway. Is there any chance of that? Are there any korean people you could hang with? 




 For some people, depression comes and goes, and for others it is a lifelong battle. The latter is true for me. It never really went away, and it took me so long to realise that it might not. When I realised that after about 15 years I was horrified at first. But resigning to that fact meant that I had to deal with it, as much as I didn't want to. Having depression doesn't necessarily mean that there aren't moments and things that are worth living for, even if the world is dark and you can't see that right now. I hope you do get to see that. 

One other thing I want to say is that while drugs and therapists are there to help, I do sometimes think that ultimately it is down to you to figure out what it is that helps you get by and what it is that makes life bearable for you. It might not be a short battle but it sounds like you have caring family and friends and resources available to help you in whatever way they can. I know you resent that you can't make that choice, and I did too, but those people care about you and they're just trying to help.  




 Glad I could be there to listen. 




 Oh I can see a tinge of blue in the light. That's going to look great. :) 




 Good luck. I hope it goes well.  




 Yay. What color did you make it? I always wanted blue streaks.  




 I'd give you money for lunch. I would never be too tired to make sure a friend could eat. :( 




 First, congratulations on finishing one of your goals. You don't have to feel overwhelming joy about it. You can recognise it for what it is though - an achievement. You've done well. 

Happiness is separate I think. It isn't about summing up success and subtracting the failures. I remember finishing something that was important to me and not really being that happy about it just feeling like.. ok great... what now? And then feeling a bit lost cause I had no idea, I'd never thought that far ahead before. I only had a plan up until that moment. You know what that means though? Now you can try doing other things and see what excites you. And it doesn't have to be achievements or stuff other people value, just stuff that you value.  




 Can you do your own cooking? Sometimes it's hard to find exactly what you want if you're eating out often.  




 Maybe you can find a hobby that lets you meet other singles like yourself. And I don't mean necessarily for the purposes of finding a girlfriend. I mean people who enjoy being single who you can hang with.  




 How about some adjective that doesn't describe that it was good/bad. That's what I generally do with questions related to asking how my day was. Like saying it was busy or quiet. This doesn't work that well if people want to ask more questions about it. Generally just saying "good" is the easiest way to have no follow up questions.  




 By the way, sorry about the slow replies. My reddit connection kept dropping in and out for some reason. :( 




 Yeah I agree that person is a dick. 

You don't need to be entitled or have specific problems to be depressed, you can just feel crappy. Also, who says your problems don't matter? Let it out if you want to... 




 I think you do need to talk about it not just bottle it up. 

Sometimes it is hard talking to friends though because then you are letting them into a very personal part of who you are and it takes a lot of trust in another person to do that.  But I also think that's what friends are for. Maybe you just need to find that person who is non-judgmental and who you can trust.

Another option is maybe talking to a psychologist or counselor? Then it's private between you and them. 




 It does sound like you are doing the best you can. And you're helping. You have taken on a lot of responsibility in taking care of your two little sisters. It does sound like he doesn't appreciate it but that's not to say it shouldn't be appreciated. 

I can't say why he is yelling at you but it sounds like it might be more to do with him than it is to do with you. 

It's hard to not care when you're faced directly with the situation. You sound like you just want it to be better and it isn't happening. 

Is this a once off thing or has this been going on for a while? Could you talk to your mum about his behavior and how it is making you feel? 




 I don't think you're just being emotional and overdramatic. Your feelings are real. 

What makes you feel like you're a failure? Is part of that because you feel like your parents don't value what you have to say?  




 You can talk to me. What's on your mind?  




 I used to sleep in my car sometimes. The worst thing was the seat belt plugs. This is a great idea.  




 I switched to Pepsi Max and it made me pee urgently so now I'm back to coke zero or diet coke with no caffeine. I should really stop :( 




 I did this for a short time and the doc said that binge eating like that can be a thyroid condition. If you are doing this a lot you should check out if you have hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. A blood test can tell you. 




 I ate maccas everyday for 6 months cause I was working full time and studying and didn't have time for a lunch break. It was so convenient to drive through and eat at traffic lights. I got pretty sick :(

Recently I hadn't had maccas in months and then I got it the other day and sat next to a really stinky homeless guy. Now I associate maccas with smelly people and I don't crave it. KFC is so much better :) Luckily it's not convenient for me. 




 Drinking coke zero. I know it's stupid and it should be easy to stop but it's everywhere. It started out as a way to have a break from the office for 5-10 mins and now it is a fully ingrained habit. It's not even supposed to be addictive. It's just delicious.  




 I did this. It's so painful. You gotta just keep trying to let go. Think of the months or years you are wasting on someone who is not reciprocating. If you keep enjoying life and doing the things you want to do you will hopefully meet someone more worthy.  




 There are some guys who hand out leftover bread at Central Station near the tram stop around 7pm. Does anyone know what charity these guys are? 




 
Edit: Didn't read that properly 




 What? 60km? As long as you're in Australia I'll post you them if you want them that badly lol. 

I also want them that badly but it is more like 1km away for me. :) 




 On second read they only store partial credit card details. Some companies do this for fraud detection.  E.g. last 4 digits and expiry which is enough to identify you but not to use your card. 




 I think they are allowed to store your credit card details if they are PCI compliant: http://www.cio.com.au/article/400300/what_pci_compliance_/

Although my understanding is that they can't store your CVV.

They probably just did it for your convenience, but maybe that was a bad decision. 

I think the biggest problem is that this is so long ago... and they didn't tell anyone :/ 




 Ah thanks for that. I remember now. I think your advice is pretty good. I am 31 and time does fly when you're older but it's not necessarily a bad thing. I think the main thing is being busy due to spending a lot of time in full time work. My advice would be to always make time for yourself and for the things that are important to you, and especially to organize some down time for yourself. Always being busy makes it feel like it's going quickly... but it doesn't have to be that way. When you're younger you can try lots of things and have lots of time for random stuff. When you're working full time you need to be a bit more selective. One thing that changes is when you have a job you have more freedom over what you do with your time and the money you earn. I try to live a life of experiences.  




 The original post was deleted and now I can't remember what this was about :/ 




 If you are fortunate enough to have a good life, give a little. Help a friend or family member out or volunteer. Thinking of others in need and not always about yourself gives your life some perspective. 




 Don't worry if you're not perfect. It's okay. You're perfect as you are with all your imperfections. Don't spend your life trying to live up to someone else's expectations. Live the life that you want.

And if your family isn't happy, well that sucks, but you're not alone. And people do care about you.  
























 I put it in my diary at a particular time, and treat it like a doctor's appointment. Once I'm there it's all good, I just get on with it. I don't think about whether I like it or not, I just go. I usually find it a good break from the stress of work, and I try to give myself a mental break from thinking about work, so it turns into a more positive experience. 




 How was it? 




 I don't quite get cover letters. I have a feeling most employers skip straight to the resume. But you don't want to be that person that looks like they didn't care enough to write one. 

I feel like it's like putting those edible flowers on desserts. I don't know if you've ever had a dessert with edible flowers, but they  don't taste like anything! At least the pansies I've had don't. So pointless, just decoration. 

Then again, maybe it's to show you can string coherent sentences together in English.  




 Haha... thanks :)  




 Thanks! :)  




 In Manly, I like 4Pines but I don't know if they're really a brunch place. They do have a view of the water behind the ferry stop. The food was surprisingly really nice, and the beer was also top notch.

A lot of people have told me Garfish is good but I've never been there. I'm not sure I'd classify it as a brunch place but it might be good for lunch.

Besides that I'm sorry I don't know cafes/restaurants in that area all that well. 




 When I went to kiama we went to the markets. There was one on Saturday   on Sunday! They are actually pretty good - different from the markets in Sydney because they are larger stalls and they have different stuff - not just stuff imported from China. I recommend the Kiama Seaside Markets if you are there. 

http://www.kiama.com.au/see-and-do/markets

Aside from that all we did was go to the beach. It was pretty relaxing. 




 I love running!!! Except I got a stress fracture in my foot from running too much only on weekends for sport and not enough during the week (so didn't build enough muscle strength). Then after 5 months of waiting, I thought it was better and ran and it was the best... run... ever... until a day later when it hurt like hell and the doctor told me I'd fractured it again. I can run again now but having a bad foot put a lot of pressure on my other foot and I got a heel spur on the other one. So now I can't run without being in pain. I tried taking a lot of neurofen but after un-recommended prolonged use it really does mess with your stomach, so I can't have it at all anymore. 

So in summary, I used to love running. Now I can't love it because it hurts too much. But I still go, only I can only run properly on grass. And when I do I feel so free!!!

Nowadays I usually ride my bike. But if my feet aren't too painful I can run every second or third day and then ice my heel afterwards.

The other problem is I usually only like running at night, by myself, with headphones in, in the park - the perfect target for criminals. 

To be honest I think I exaggerated how much I like running... I think I just miss it because I can't do it whenever i want. But I really did only like the healthy feeling afterwards, where your whole body feels energised. I like running to music though because I can try to keep the beat. I also like sprinting... I get a kick out of it.  




 ~~Jamberoo is a little bit of a drive from Kiama~~ (oh correction - it's only 15 minutes... well, it seemed like a way away!) I drove past it last time but we didn't want to leave Kiama so gave it a miss. Is it worth it? I've always wanted to go there, mainly for the waterskiing. But then sometimes I think maybe I should just hire a speedboat and take myself on a river. 




 That's ... not well thought out! 




 Oh yeah, there is that lol. I just figured you wouldn't go visit that before heading out on a long drive, but you could if you wanted to! 




 Oh. Sorry. Basic comprehension is not my strong point. 




 As long as you follow it up with "cause I'll do all your shit for you!" Then that'll be sweet  




 Are you in Sydney? Depends how far you want to go. I'm in the inner west so usually hang around Glebe or Newtown. If you want more of a seaside thing you could try Bills In Bondi but actually there's a lot of great places at Bondi. I prefer sitting at the cafe down on the waterfront so you can watch the waves and surfers. I also like Bronte but there's only like 2-3 cafes. Another thing I'd think about doing is Yum Cha. There was a discount voucher on Groupon for Emperors Garden in Chinatown. http://m.groupon.com.au/deals/sydney/emperor-s-garden-seafood-restaurant-1-1/719919595 I eat there regularly and I like it. In the city if you like simple food you could try Jamie Olivers cafe but it's a little on the pricey side. 




 I'd second going the whole way in a trip. I also don't think you'll have 1.5 hours in stops because there's not that much to see on the way. If you have a second driver you can do a couple of toilet stops and have a single longer stop for lunch or dinner. 




 True unless they lose an eye. Gotta watch out for eye loss.  




 Yeah I also find this article a bit empty. I would think a discussion about the pay gap by both occupation and years of experience would be more insightful.  




 I've had plenty of guys offer to shake hands with me in formal situations. It's not weird to me at all.  




 I've driven in Vegas and around there. It was great. I'd recommend it actually. The roads are fast as they're in the desert. Worth renting a nice car for it and bringing some good music. I loved it. Also, take water with you and pay for the insurance. 

I'm heading to San Francisco tomorrow but we looked into cars. If you plan on staying in the city centre keep in mind parking is really really expensive. Actually could cost more than the car rental. I feel like it's not worth it.

Also if you drive in LA get a good GPS with lane guidance. The highways there have six lanes and exits on the right and left. So you can potentially enter traffic from the right, cross 3-6 lanes, exit on the left, then merge with traffic on your turn. That was my first experience and quite scary. Driving in the US after that was easy. I only experienced that in LA though.  

But yeah generally the roads in the US are pretty good to drive on. 

You should just make yourself familiar with the 4 way stop. First time I got to an intersection like that I was pretty confused... even though I'd read about them first. 




 Also I learnt that outside Sydney servos aren't open all night. Lucky I was hungry for a late night pie or else I would've run out of fuel. Apparently other people have told me that everyone knows that... seems everyone else except for me knows that. 




 By the way, thanks for the chat. My sleeping patterns are all out of whack. The daylight savings time change isn't helping either! 




 Oh that is good to know about Copper Mountain. I heard the name on TV while here but that's all I know about it. 

Yeah the beer here is pretty nice actually. I didn't know Colorado was into craft brewing but it's pretty sweet to try the stuff here. Unfortunately I didn't try too much. The bus back from Aspen to Snowmass is deadly to weak stomachs as one poor sod on the bus and all the rest of us found out. What I had was wonderful though.

We put our house buying plans on hold for this trip. The property prices in Sydney have spiralled out of control so we sort of gave up for the time being. When I get back I think moving out of my tiny unit into something more liveable might have to be my next goal. :)

So happy to hear I'm not alone in my goals. Except opposite countries... you know what I mean... 




 Oh by the way. In my (completely biased) opinion, our coffee is also usually better. It's the only other food thing I really miss.  




 Sounds nice. I just wanted to go snowboarding over here before I got too old to enjoy it. It was a dream I've had since I was in high school. I planned to go to Canada on a working holiday years ago but broke my shoulder and my plans along with it. I would love to come back in summer. The whole Rocky mountains is amazing. However I may be out of travel money and leave for a while after this trip (no regrets though). :)

If you haven't been to Australia you might find it more affordable now the AUD has dropped against the USD. We timed our trip quite poorly lol. 




 That's pretty cool. I think that's the main problem when people try Vegemite. They don't know how to eat it and use way too much. Glad you liked it! :) 

I do like Colorado. It's actually a lot like New Zealand's South Island but with better snow and more trees and wildlife. NZ has nice lakes though that you can see from the ski fields. I love nature so it's good for me. :)  




 I did it too and I also felt this way when answering some of the questions. They would lead off previous questions but I didn't feel like the following question was relevant anymore after my previous answer. Crafting surveys is actually pretty hard.  




 I think I stopped playing games as much when I started working full time. In high school and uni I'd spend hours each week. But now my free time is very limited. So it's more a changing lifestyle thing, rather than being because I gained access to a smart phone.  




 Haha. That is a very Australian meal! I've never heard of an American eating Vegemite. How did you get into that? Have you been to Australia? 

I am in Snowmass on a short visit. Leaving tomorrow to our last stop before heading home. We saved for years to come to the US and Canada and followed the storms here. It's very pretty   the snow has been amazing. The only thing I've found is that I really feel like I don't fit in at  all. But then I think the people here are also not your typical Americans/people. I have never seen so many private jets in one place. I also don't think many of the people here are actually from Colorado. I reckon we should have spent a day or something in Denver but we only went through the airport. 




 I'm an Australian actually in Colorado. I don't know why but I miss Australia quite a lot here. Maybe you should move to Australia. Sounds like you would fit in well.  




 I am a female who works in IT. After many years of gaining experience I feel I have much more equality, and I am generally well respected now. I do feel on par with my colleagues.

But I truly believe this might not have happened had I not worked for a federal government department with intake quotas. Their policy is not to employ 50% of each gender, but for a graduate year to employ the same proportion of graduates by gender. So if in 2015, 20% of grads were female, they'd aim to hire 20% of their intake as females.

It's a little simpler for graduates though. It's even harder for companies to find women with experience further along in their careers also because many are also not given the same career advancement opportunities once initially employed. 

I'm glad to say that was not the case for me though, and I owe quite a lot to equal opportunity and gender equality programs, along with a lot of hard work on my part in overcoming these issues.  




 I've claimed using the CBA credit card with Zurich too. They sent a letter after I sent in the claim to ask for more details (it was a theft) but once I replied by email, they paid my claim. I always use it now. Just be sure to see what you need when claiming. I had to spend a day at a police station to get a police report about the theft... which was a little tricky with the language barrier. 

Just need to read the PDS cause you have to book with the CC, but they've changed it now from a percentage to a minimum dollar amount. I think it's $1000 now and your partner should also be covered. Not hard to spend that when travelling from Australia.  




 I know I'm just some random person on the Internet but please don't give up. People do shitty things because they're imperfect, not because you do or don't deserve it. I know what it's like to care about someone and get shat on. It's terrible, gut wrenching and soul destroying. But you're still important and I hope you will give the world another chance. I hope you will get through tonight, then tomorrow, then the next night. And I hope sometime you will see that your life is worth it.  




 I haven't heard of that podcast before. What is it about? 

It's really tough making friends and meeting people. Most people are up for a quick conversation but then go onto continue their daily lives. I guess you just have to go through meeting a lot of people before you meet one that you click with. It gets sort of tiring though I've found and unless people are kind of forced to be around me, like if they work with me, then it just doesn't really seem to take off. 

8 months is a little while. Do you still keep in touch with your old friends? They sound fun :) 




 Sounds like an interesting job. I do consulting so am often at clients by myself. The worst is traveling alone and eating alone. I usually turn on the TV just to hear other people talking. I think it's worse at night. 

How long have you been there for? My stints are usually only a week at a time so not too long. 




 Hi. Sucks being alone sometimes doesn't it :( What are you doing there? Did you travel for work? 




 Seems like going out in Sydney and enjoying life is banned these days.  




 I'll keep an eye out at Snowmass. I hope you get it back!  




 I'm in Montreal today and there were a lot of delays from here and long queues waiting at central station. Not sure if it's related. 




 I would have thought a zebra would have been a better choice for a bar code animal talking about vegetarians.  




 I guess it must be easier to clean. I see them all the time nowadays.  I'm not really a fan though. The water does drain toward the wall but I find it doesn't really stay contained. I also like shaking my hands in the bowl of the sink and it's hard when the sink has no sides.  




 It's all the people who don't like Hersheys coming together. i.e. non-Americans. We don't rub it in your face in person that your chocolate sucks though, we see how happy you are not knowing any better. People on the internet are just more honest. :) 




 Yeah Cadburys is actually pretty cheap. I think we can get 350g for like $3 here in Australia on sale. Maybe normal price is $5-7 ( http://shop.coles.com.au/online/mobile/national/cadbury-milk-chocolate-block-dairy-milk ). Also the regular plain milk chocolate is now fair trade so even better.  




 It's like chocolate but with less creaminess and also a bit more cardboard and chalk flavouring. Also it's harder and less melty. Kind of like stale chocolate that expired a year ago.  




 That's what I thought too. Otherwise Christians would still be required to slaughter lambs to save themselves instead of praying to Jesus who replaced the lambs. 

Sometimes I wonder if maybe he just didn't like seeing lambs killed and let himself get killed through a really elaborate story so less lambs had to be slaughtered for redemption. Maybe Jesus was just a simple vegetarian. 




 I went to one of the Lawsons estate auctions of someone's stuff in Bellevue Hill. Didn't buy anything just wanted to see cause I've never been. 

There was a maid... Like she had her own bedroom next to the kitchen and wore the little black and white outfit. A maid!!! Like from TV! !

I also discovered those auctions are good for furniture because people go for the art and don't care about the furniture so it's cheap.  




 So what you're saying is that it's both adorable AND practical! :) 




 I love how they are colour coded! 




 I am one of those people that overanalyses my day to day life and I always feel like this. Sometimes it helps if I lay in bed and think about where I am right now and analyse just the present. It gives me a short reprieve from everything outside of my room and I am just in this moment right now. Maybe you can try it.

Like right now I am typing on an iPad on my bed and the air conditioning is on which I am glad for because i hate feeling sweaty when I'm about to sleep. I'm a little tired and have a headache but I'm glad the day is over. I'm not going to think about tomorrow... Just the next 5 minutes and I'm focused on this message and thinking about how when I sleep my mind will shut down for just a few hours and me and it will have our daily short but very necessary holiday away from each other. 




 Hugs. We care. I know we are just strangers but I wish somehow we could take away the suffering.

Do you think you can get another job? Maybe something to help you pay the bills?  




 Hypothetically what would you like your life to look like? 




 I know the feeling of not being able to get out of bed. It's tormenting because I know if I don't make an effort things will only get worse but all I can manage right now is the bare minimum.

If you take the job and it doesn't work out can you quit? Maybe you could just try it out and see how it goes. Maybe it isn't as bad as you imagine? Is your friend working there?  




 Go to Target, get a set with a fitted sheet, a flat sheet and pillowcases. 1000 thread count is best so don't bother feeling it just get it. (Eg. 
http://www.target.com.au/p/1-thread-count-cotton-sheet-set-white/181097_white )

The Target stuff is good quality but if you want something nicer you can get Vue sheets at Myer that are a bit nicer and don't have the premium of being Sheridan. (Eg. http://m.myer.com.au/shop/mobile/mystore/au-vue-tranquil-300tc-sb-sheet-set-d-19653 ) Though if you want Sheridan stuff and have a car I recommend driving to the Sheridan outlet over near Arncliffe unless that is too far. It's last season stock but still great quality and a fair bit cheaper. With these brands I go for 200- 400 TC. (Eg. http://www.sheridanfactoryoutlet.com.au/sheets/sheridan-300-thread-count-caffery-sheet-set.html ) The honest truth is if you see no difference between thread counts get the cheaper one cause it's probably just wasted money if you don't mind. 

Get a mattress protector. Not the waterproof ones cause they don't breathe. Just a regular one. Tontine are good but most are fine.

Get a blanket, doona or fleece. If doona you need a cover. Anything is fine as long as the size of the doona and the cover matches your mattress. In winter the best and most expensive is goose down but it will be very hot in summer. I have different toppings for summer and winter. 

Get a pillow. This part I suck at. Everyone likes different pillows. Get a pillow protector. Nothing fancy. The $5 ones from kmart will do. It will make your pillow last longer ie. Not go yellow as fast. 

Also don't buy white. Your sheets will look dirty fast.

And don't wash fitted sheets with hot water. It destroys the elastic.

Oh and everything above should be cotton apart from the blanket, doona, fleece or throw (ie. The warm layer). Though a cotton throw can be good in summer as it has the weight without being too warm.

Also don't buy European pillows or pillowcases or decorative cushions. Useless.  




 I moved out about 22 or 23. It really became necessary when I was studying and working in the city. The 3 hour return commute from my parents wasn't working for me anymore.  




 Here in Australia I have never used up my sick leave allowance... ever... my boss even let me use it when I got my wisdom teeth pulled which I'm not sure is strictly sick leave as it's planned. It would be against the law here to force someone to come to work when they are sick and have a doctor's certificate proving it. Workers here are entitled to 10 days per year when full-time. 




 [Identical](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/ed/c1/b0/edc1b0e2431d14eddc848353475d93eb.jpg) 




 China hates Japan because of what they did in the war. I don't see why they would bother attacking Australia. They can mostly already get what they need from us. 




 So wouldn't that put Australia on par in terms of progressive-ness? Is there something else as well?  




 It's like everyone's forgotten that China and Australia fought together at one point. 

Not saying we should side again but why do we have to side with anyone.

Japanese leaders weren't completely removed from ruling after the war like they were in Germany. See http://www.crf-usa.org/election-central/bringing-democracy-to-japan.html
The current government descends from that... I think China still feels that was not right but had little say in it at the time and will not accept Japan's many apologies while they feel that the same organization that commited what were horrific war crimes against them, are still in power. To understand why China hates Japan look at the massacres and war crimes they committed.

China is growing to a position of power but they have so many internal problems at the moment without involving other countries. They have the power to bully Japan on the side but probably no interest in taking it too far right now.  




 Sounds like you have a warranty on the battery so yeah this makes the most sense. But do you know someone who can take it out and put it back in for you? Cause obviously sounds like you can't drive the car there to get someone to do it. It's actually pretty simple but if you're not good with cars you might want someone else to do it. 




 There is a Kmart Tyre and Auto on Booth Street or one at Broadway near the fruit shop. Or I find Glebe Auto Repairs on Bridge Rd cheaper. If you call them they may have some suggestions for getting your car there or visiting you.  




 I'm curious to know why Australia is considered less progressive? Not arguing either way... but I would like to understand the perception.  




 I spent 6.5 years at Sydney Uni so ask me anything. But I'm Australian so don't know what it's like as an American. Though my supervisor was from the US so always told me about it. 

1) assuming you're coming as an undergraduate: not that many Aussies live on campus. Most commute at least for their first year. Otherwise it should be pretty similar to the US.

2) This is unlikely to be a problem. Sydney Uni is fairly diverse. 

3) Depends what you're after and what experience if any you have. If you have an RSA you can try bar work. If you have done some prior study you can do tutoring. You can do babysitting.  The Uni has a casual and part time job portal: http://sydney.edu.au/careers/finding_jobs/casual.shtml
You might need to be enrolled to log in.  




 Reminded me of this guy: http://m.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/queensland-man-bitten-by-deadly-snake-grabs-a-beer-20140310-34iik.html 




 I'm not a parent so I feel rather ignorant. I have a relative whose kid only eats chips and nuggets and it seems rather unhealthy but they have a hard time getting them to eat other foods. I have heard other parents say the same thing about bananas or fruits. Why are kids so selective?  




 Exciting! Have a good trip! 




 I like New Zealand but I wouldn't consider it a place to go for job opportunities.  




 I'm not sure why this was getting downvoted. We are lucky to be in Australia. I always wanted to leave but now having seen a lot more of the world I can't imagine leaving permanently by choice.  




 Have pity on us who live next to dogs like that the rest of the year. Just kill me...

Oh and you report problem dogs to council.  




 It was a bit windy today in Sydney! I thought about going out but we ended up just walking about a block. I feel super lazy. Tomorrow I will go for a run! 




 I think I'm bored, but I don't have the energy to do anything. Maybe I should go back to sleep. 




 I love Christmas ham.  




 I have a muslim Jordanian friend and he said the prejudice is way worse there than in Australia. I would have never guessed from my short trip there... 




 Bundeena to Marley is shortish. Marley Beach is nice. 




 I suppose it depends on the kind of fashion you're into. Myer and DJs are good for footwear and work clothes. Myer is also ok for casual. If you want gym stuff then Rebel in either mid city or King St. If you want other casual clothes it depends on your tastes. The chain stores have the best sales usually. 




 You cant skip New Years Eve in Sydney. I tried it a couple of years and it was fine until the party in the city started on TV and then I wanted to be there in the thick of it even though I know all too well how the night is going to end. 
(Also dont watch the ABC coverage. Itll ruin New Years Eve forever for you.)

Usually the night starts off great. The anticipation of a great night ahead is building. Depending on what Im doing Ill get dressed up - heels, dress, hair, etc. or in a low key year  casual clothes. Im pretty excited about going out into the city. I try to drink heaps of water through the day to make sure Im fully hydrated and pack the fridge with some Gatorade for later. Im still feeling clean.  

Then you might have a drink or two before heading into the CBD. Here youre on the bus or train with everyone else still fairly sober and well-behaved. Everyones kind of in a good mood and it feels fun, since its the end of an old year and you can say goodbye to your loser 2014 self and say hello to your new and improved 2015 self who at this point hasnt had a chance to screw everything up yet. Youre a clean slate, and the crispness of the air conditioning in the train and bus just affirms to you that this year will be different to all the others - youre going to be a new person now.

As you arrive in the CBD and get off the bus or train, you make your way to your 9pm fireworks location and possibly your location for the rest of the night. Sometimes its Darling Harbour, sometimes its Circular Quay somewhere, sometimes its a harbour side vantage point or a private party of a friend of a friend of who the hell knows? Wherever it is, you probably have to stay on your side of the bridge or else plan to stay out until much later than you would ever have planned But right now you just need the best spot possible. The rest is a problem for later.  

If youre lucky enough to have found a harbourside party, great! Youre probably in the best position to enjoy New Years. You just need to take your own drinks and youre set. Just wander down to the nearest lookout and then meander back to the house between the 9 and 12. All you have to do is drink, dance and try to avoid getting into any fights.  

If you havent found a party which is most years then you probably will sit around getting slowly more intoxicated while reminiscing the last year, discussing any resolutions youre making and waiting for the 9pm fireworks to light up. If you didn't sneak any alcohol past the checkpoint.... sigh. Prepare yourself - it's going to feel pretty drawn out. The same boat with snake lights will go left and right in front of you, but its still kind of nice looking out over the harbour with those lights (as long as its not raining and you don't sit under a tree where bats will shit on you). Try not to get sunburnt too, that kind of puts a damper on things to come. 

When the fireworks go off at 9pm youre probably feeling like  OMG Fireworks!!! Ive waited for HOURS and they are the best EVER!! I love Sydney! Yay! By now youre getting a bit tipsy, all the children are running around on the grass with their glow sticks and whirry glow sticks. After that some families head home, others stick it out.

Then you start the long haul wait for the midnight fireworks. How this goes depends a lot on your location and company but generally if youre in a grassed area it involves drinking whatever you sneaked past the checkpoint, eating snacks, talking crap and waiting If youre comfortable and have enough to drink this goes fairly quickly, if youre not its slooow. 

Then, at last, the final few minutes to midnight. You can hear the whole city getting excited. This is the part where if you stayed home youd start regretting it. Everyone is excited to see in the new year, people are starting to bustle for a good spot to see the fireworks. Then the countdown on the harbour bridge starts, you can see the numbers light up and everyone stands up at once. The whole city screams out the countdown to midnight and there is this amazing sense of awe along with the collective sound of a few of those roll-out party pipes as the first midnight fireworks bless the sky and make the loudest thunder and clap and crackle, and light the sky with the full rainbow of colours. If youre near the foreshore sometimes theres music but sometimes the sound of the fireworks is too loud to hear it. The sound vibrates inside of you and you can feel the new year start. Whatever the theme is lights up on the bridge, people do their new years kisses, the party horns sound and you can hear everyone ooo and ahh at the fireworks. The fireworks seem to never end. There are fireworks left right and centre and you can see them and its amazing. However you felt about it earlier in the night, the wait was worth it.

When it finally ends everyone yells out to random strangers Happy New Year! as people start to make their way from wherever they are to wherever theyre going. Usually theres some aggressive teenage boys who push and shove and elbow their way through the crowd, like somehow its really going to make a difference, but everyone is in too good a mood/not sober enough to pay too much attention. Most people start to wander off and then you see the huge piles of crap left all over the ground and the poor grass being completely destroyed. 

As you leave the space between people gets a little larger. If you decided to go home from Circular Quay via George Street youll have to contend with everyone else. Its like the harbour was a giant stadium with no orderly exit strategy, just a million people who all want to exit at once. Most people are pretty well behaved, but some start pouring out of bars drunk and disorderly and getting into fights. Thankfully theres not the copious amounts of broken glass all over the road there used to be but it can still get pretty gnarly. Its been a while since I walked down the Rocks, but I think itd still be similar. 

Ive never caught the train at Circular Quay  it just never works out and I cant even tell how long the wait is because theres just too many people  so usually we start our trek up George Street with everyone else. People at first are fairly orderly, then as more time passes more of the dregs start making their way up with the girls falling over in their less than practical footwear, guys vomiting and urinating and youve got the best seats in the house to the worst show on earth. You probably want to zig-zag up the road and pay close attention to where you place your feet at this point.  

Its been a while since Ive gotten the train back from the city - now we generally walk a few kms to get home and if we're lucky we'll nab a taxi. By the time I get home Im either completely sober or feeling pretty ill, though generally I feel really dirty but also dont care all that much because I'm so tired. Ill collapse into bed thinking next year maybe Ill just stay at home mainly because getting home was so damn hard. But as I fall asleep Ill think of the smell, sound and colours of the fireworks and dream about doing it all over again. :)

Another option is to watch the fireworks from a park or location further out of the city. This can be a lot more relaxing, the alcohol rules aren't as strict and there's less idiots around. When you're not keen for the hassle of the CBD, this is usually the best way to enjoy NY's. Just as long as you have a way to get home, preferably walking. The upside of this is you just got to chill out and get home easy, and you will be able to wake up the next morning and still enjoy New Year's Day. 




 If you want to drink most of the public vantage points around the city areas are alcohol free zones. http://www.sydneynewyearseve.com/vantage-points/  Probably best to try to find an alcohol on sale site on the harbour. 

If you have some money to spend maybe you can go to Luna Park - I haven't been so can't tell you if it's good. There's different price tiers though, so I guess depends what you're after. http://www.moshtix.com.au/v2/event/harbour-party-nye-2014/73390

 




 Are you looking for something in particular or just keen for a browse? It's mayhem in the city, so I'd probably plan to visit stores in location order to minimise the time fighting the crowd.  




 I wish they were still here with us... :( 




 There's some shops in Chinatown that sell weird singlets/shirts. They probably have a VB one. 




 It was a really amazing and beautiful gesture to have so many flowers out there and so many people going to pay their respects. And a great idea to turn them into something and save all the notes.

I went there the day before they were removed though, and some of the older bunches were actually starting to smell pretty bad. I think it was good timing to pack them up. If a storm did come through as forecast and destroy the flowers more it wouldn't have been a good scene to wake up to. 




 If it's raining:

- Chinese/Asian places are usually open e.g. Chinatown, Cabramatta
- Some other cafes/restaurants should be open e.g. Lowenbrau
- Cinemas
- [Sydney Acquarium](http://www.sydneyaquarium.com.au/visitor-info/opening-hours/)
- Ferry Ride (if it's not too windy - but it looks like there'll be thunderstorms tomorrow)

Merry Christmas :) Hope you find something fun to do.

Edit: Didn't read the title properly! 




 I've found that most people I've spoken to don't know the difference between a virus and a bacteria. It seems that it's just not something people learn in high school.  




 No problem at all! I'm glad you heard my words and that I could brighten your day. :)  




 I wish I could hug you. You were desperate and you felt like there was no way out. Guilt is a difficult thing to overcome, especially when you feel like it really was your fault. But despite what people say, it is possible to change. You can still hate what you did, but you don't have to hate yourself. You're human, and everyone makes mistakes. You're not the first person to have hurt other people and you won't be the last. 

I'm not saying to forget what you did, obviously it is something that is deeply bothering you. In fact if we just forget we don't really learn from the past. I'm saying to separate the act from the person you are. You can be a different person now and perform different actions. 

Also mistakes are a part of life. We all make mistakes. Some mistakes feel impossible to let go of. There are things that I deeply regret and if I had a chance I would go back and change it in an instant. But I can't. So the way forward for me is to try not to let it happen again. It may, but at least I will have done my best to try. 




 What will you be doing in Japan? Maybe the change would be good. 

It's difficult when you're unsure of what you want. What are your options? Maybe write down all the things you've thought of doing and the pros and cons of each one and then once you've had a thorough think through, try talking with a friend (probably not your SO or her mum though as it might complicate things). Maybe that will help. It might at least help you clarify what it is about each of the things that you're attracted to and identify what's missing right now in your life.

If you don't have other friends to talk to you can talk to me about it if you want too. I'm all ears :) 




 Life can be worth living and it's hard to see that sometimes. It definitely doesn't and probably won't feel like that all the time, but hopefully there are parts that make it worth it. If you're not feeling good about not having a job... then the only answer to that is to get a job, even if it's not your dream job. 

Right now you're stuck in a cycle. You feel crap so you have no motivation to do anything, and the lack of motivation is making you feel crap. To get out of the cycle you need to start small. Pick something you want to work on, and work on that. 

People are giving you pressures because they care about you. But you don't have to listen to any of them, it's entirely up to you. But don't change things for anyone else, change things for yourself - to make you happier and your life better. You can do it, I believe you can!  




 Sounds like a pretty difficult situation you're in. Can I ask you a question though - what do you want? I hear you say a lot about what you don't want, which is helpful, but what would you like things to be like?

You sound like an amazing caring and loving person, but it sort of also sounds like you've put everyone else before yourself.  




 You've surprised me because I've been feeling the exact same way. 

I was really fit before but I had a stress fracture about 2 years ago and I've put on about 10kg. I waited a long time for it to recover (I think it was 6 months), but I couldn't rest it because my job requires me to move around a lot and carry my laptop around (which is not a lot of fun while wearing a moon boot). Anyway, I decided I needed to run, so I went for a jog one day and it was awesome... I missed it so much... then the next day my foot is in a heap of pain. Turns out I fractured it again. This time I had to wait a year for it to heal. 

A lot of other stuff happened in my life. I got married and I was much bigger than I would have liked. Don't get me wrong I'm so happy to be married but it was a very stressful lead up to the wedding. On my wedding day I nearly had coldsores but luckily somehow they went down. I have been in some very stressful situations at my work and it has really made it hard for me to feel positive. I am just so busy I don't have time to think about it most of the time, but if I did I know I wouldn't be happy.

There are a lot of things I don't like about my life. It got pretty bad and I was ready to let go of everything. At 3am I was sitting down preparing myself and a police car drove up next to my car and asked me if everything was ok. I burst into tears and he asked what I was doing and if I wanted to talk about it and I said no I just needed some alone time. He said if I needed anything I knew who to call. That simple act was enough to get me through. 

This past year a few people close to me have passed away - one to suicide - and going to the funeral sealed in my mind that I would go through any amount of pain to save my family or friends from that suffering. It has been really tough. This forum has been a place that I have been able to come and talk to people about things and it has made it more bearable. I really truly encourage you to do the same, and if there is anything you need to talk about or just vent then just PM me anytime.

Sometimes life is really tough but you will get through it. 

In terms of motivation, after the 4th death of a close friend this year I just couldn't do anything. I stopped doing the dishes, the house was a mess... things just sort of started to fall apart. I went to the psychologist and she asked what was bothering me the most and I told her it was the house. She told me to just pick one thing each day - like say, doing the dishes and do it. Each day has been a struggle but I am slowly getting better. Maybe you can try to do the same? 




 Do you want it to change?

I guess at the end of the day only you really know yourself. We're all kind of trapped inside ourselves to some extent and it's hard for others to see what we're feeling or thinking. 

But it doesn't mean people can't know you to some extent. I'm pretty private but I do let the important people in my life in. 




 How long have you been feeling this way? Is there something you're particularly unhappy about or just generally feeling flat? 

How you feel is how you feel, you don't need to feel guilty for those feelings. Almsot everyone has times when they wish for things to be different.

To me it sounds like you need to keep putting one foot in front of the other and trying to do things that lift you and make you feel like you're taking active steps towards something. Maybe it's something little like going for walks each day or sticking to a schedule, or maybe they're bigger things like changing jobs. Is there something that is most bothering you right now? Maybe that is a good place to start. What do you think? 




 I was trying to reply to a lot of posts but then my own day to day life   problems get in the way. It's not that I don't want to reply, just that sometimes I am too drained myself to do so. But I would reply to everyone if I could!  




 I lol'ed at ass o'clock :) 




 Do you think she left you purely because being a parent was too stressful? I feel like there is probably more to this story than that. 




 My favorite bags are Coach and Mimco. Mimco bags I only get on sale because they're on sale all the time. Oroton has some nice ones. I also saw some pretty nice ones in Marcs. Myer is worth checking out too. If I want something cheaper then I also look at Nine West although I don't think they're leather.  




 Oh... really... so I just learnt that "spelt" wasn't used in the US much. I wouldn't have even thought about it.
