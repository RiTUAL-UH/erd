 I've posted this before, but here it is again:

I once did a "job shadow" (learn about other jobs at our company) for this very odd girl from the mail room. The first day, she works into conversation that 1 out of 3 women has had an abortion. Then she points down my cubie aisle and says: "So 2 of the people on this row have had abortions." Not even trying to be quiet about it. I look at her, astounded, and she leans in close and whispers "2 of them were me, though..." Then pulls back and I must had had a very confounded expression on my face because she goes, "I've had 2."

So that was Day 1.

Day 2 she comes in and let's me know she wont be there the next morning because she has a doctor's appointment. I say "ok." Most people would leave it at that but of course that's not gonna happen. She says "You know, my yearly?" I am a woman so I said "Yes, I know." She then proceeds to spread her legs, squat down a few inches, point up to her crotch and say "It's for down there." She didn't come back the next day, thank God, but just knowing she's still down in the mailroom, creeping up everybody's day makes me sad.

 Please say yes. 




 Cool thanks! I hope it's neat, we want to go this year.

 First one to make me audibly laugh. nicely done. 




 That's the problem, the tort reform lobby has gotten to almost everyone.  




 She didn't sue McDonalds for punitive damages, she sued for coverage of her medical bills. The judge awarded punitive damages. 




 Do you work for McDonalds? 




 A smear campaign that clearly worked. 




 Sorry - edited. 




 Actually I think that woman is dead now. 




 Exactly. 




 Keep it mind, this is what McDonalds and other corporations WANT you to think. They want people to find civil lawsuits ridiculous and to shame those who sue, because in the end it can not only discourage people from suing, but also affect tort law in America. 




 It caused extreme third degree burns. It was definitely too hot. It's coffee; yes, it should be hot - not scalding.  




 Most people don't know or don't care about the whole story. She really did have terrible, horrible burns. She asked for her medical bills to be paid and actually settled for much less than the jury originally awarded, if I remember right.

We must be very careful with Tort Reform.

 Based on information provided here by /u/MountainDerp and several others through PM, I think I may have narrowed down an area where Middlesbrough may have been. I am going to take a trip out there during spring break next month and drive through, look for anything remotely familiar. 

I promise to update you all when I get back.

 The Spire in the Woods is my favorite. It's the only one that I still think about occasionally. 




 I saw it moving through the shaft of light on the staircase. I wish it was a WA because if it had been, then that means a Doctor would have been there to save us. 




 Yeah, someone suggested making longer stories into a series but when I found out I had to post it on three separate days, I bailed on that idea. If you want to know what it was like to be there, you have to read it all at once.  




 I couldn't say - we drove there from Chicago. If I had to make a guess I based on the landscape I remember, I would say Western PA. 




 I don't know where in PA I was - I was 12 at the time.  




 Yeah, as below, the camera stayed in the church. I really would go back if I knew where to go. There were pictures of Jamie on there. 




 I have no idea where it is/was. I was a kid at the time and my mom doesn't think she's ever been there. 




 Yes I can. They were mostly triangular, like triangles within and overlapping other triangles, if that makes sense. 




 I wish I knew. My mom is convinced she was never there and I was a kid at the time so vital information like this has slipped away.  




 I don't even know what to say to this except that I am embarrassingly flattered. 




 Who fans unite 




 Thank you! 




 Yeah I didn't know about that rule. I have discontinued it as a series and posted the entire story here instead.  




 When I was a kid my dad traveled a lot for work. Back then, his company was growing exponentially and my father was sent to oversee the opening of new stores all across the country. In 2002, he had a particularly busy year. My dad was assigned to a store in Pennsylvania and, because it was a longer assignment and because it was summertime as well, he decided to take my mom and I with him. 

 
Since we were going to be there for two months, they gave us a fully furnished house in the suburbs. It was two stories tall and at the end of a very lonely cul-de-sac. The town itself was very small, with a little over 3,000 residents, and the suburb where we stayed was even more rural.  


Our neighborhood was relatively new, and most of the houses were still empty. The housing development, Lone Wood, had only just started cutting into the dense forest that surrounded it and all the empty houses gave it a very eerie, albeit boring, feel. 


Lucky for me, there were a few other kids who lived in Lone Wood and one of them happened to be my age. Jamie and I were both 12 and really that was all we needed to have in common. 


We had a lot of fun that summer. Being a city kid, I was eager to explore all the bike trails local kids had made out in the woods. The city of Middlesbrough was a very old town which was incorporated sometime in the early 1800s. The town had tons of history, but nothing really to do. One particularly boring Sunday, Jamie and I even went to the towns museum. 


It was pretty boring, as expected, until we heard some kid ask an employee about the lost town. The employee replied that that was just a legend, but that was enough to pique my curiosity.


I quizzed Jamie about it but he didnt seem to know much either. It was a full five weeks into the summer before I finally got my questions answered.


Jamie and I were building a bike ramp over a narrow stream late one afternoon when we saw a group of five teenagers boisterously heading out into the woods. They were carrying flashlights and beer, several of them trying to scare the girls of  the group into turning back.


I wonder where theyre going. I mused as I glanced over at Jamie. He stood up and wiped his brow. 


I know where theyre going.


Where? I stood up and dusted the dirt off my shorts. The novelty of living in a small town had weeks ago given way to boredom and I jumped on anything that sounded remotely interesting.  


Theyre looking for the Lost Town. He sighed regretfully.


Okay, seriously, what is that? I knew you know more than you let on. I need to know Jamie, I need to know! I shook his shoulders in mock hysteria and he stumbled for balance.

 Alright! Ill tell you, geez, Katie! Jamie picked up his bike and started walking down the bike path. I grabbed mine and followed him.

The Lost Town is just a dumb legend.  The stories say that Middlesbrough had a sister city nearby, somewhere out in these woods. Then one day, like a century and a half ago, the whole town just disappeared. The people left or died, nobody knows, nobody even remembers the name of the town. Its like a right of passage or something for kids to go looking for it.


"Jamie we should-


No! He stopped and turned to look at me. Some kid went looking for it in the 70s and never came back. They found his body like ten years later in the middle of nowhere. He got lost out there. Its easy to do, everything looks the same.


He was a total idiot! Probably on drugs, it was 70s. We are a totally different generation - we have satnav!

Satnav? He looked at me curiously. Jamie had lived in this 
town his whole life and sometimes I forgot how sheltered he was.

Satellite Navigation? My dad has a GPS that he totally wouldnt notice missing for a day. Come on Jamie, itd be so much fun!

Id better get back. Jamie looked at his watch and then mounted his bike. My dad is taking me to a movie tonight. 

We rode in an uncomfortable silence until an idea struck me as we rolled over the abandoned train tracks. They were old and almost buried by plant growth. 

Hey I know you dont want to talk about it, but has anyone ever found anything?

No. Well, my friends older brother said he found some human bones out there once, but nobody believed him.

Oh. And where do people look?

Well, almost everybody goes to the lake. He pointed to the left of us, where wed seen the teenagers heading earlier. Its pretty deep back there but they figure that if there was another town, they would have lived by the lake, sothats where they go.	


Well, you know what I would do? I would follow the train tracks. I mean, they look pretty old. And I dont know why they would lay them going back into those woods unless there was something back there, so thats where Id go.


Jamie considered this and then nodded. Yeah, I guess I could buy that. No one follows the tracks that way, though. Thats where that kid that disappeared went. 


I wasnt swayed.


I didnt bring up the Lost Town again until two weeks later. It was the weekend before we were moving home and my parents had a barbeque for the employees of dads new store and some of our neighbors. Jamie and I hung out inside the house and played my N64 while we flirted pretty outrageously. There had been an unspoken sort of mutual attraction throughout the summer that no one had had the guts to act on. Since I was moving home in five days, there really was nothing left to lose. 


Although his intentions were probably pure and genuine, I am embarrassed to say that mine were not. I thought that if I could make him want to impress me, he would agree to go looking for the Lost Town. The legend had thoroughly consumed me. I had been to the local library every morning for the past week looking for more information on the town and had found nothing. But legends dont just come from nowhere! I was sure of it.


I knew if we didnt leave by 2pm we wouldnt have enough daylight to carry out my plan. I already had a backpack packed with water, a flashlight, a camera and a can of red spray-paint. I figured if we left the tracks we would need a way to find our way back to them. I thought I was so clever. 


Nothing in that backpack made a damn bit of difference in the end. I was a fool.	
 
	
I set my controller down and turned to look at Jamie. 


Sodo you want to go out to the woods one last time? I raised my eyebrow at him and smiled. 


Yeah! He said excitedly and he jumped up off the couch. Then, embarrassed, he cast his eyes down at the floor. Yeah, you know..if you want to, thats cool.


Cool, lets go! I grabbed his hand and ran out the front door, grabbing my strategically placed backpack on the way. Jamie didnt even notice it; he was walking faster than I was.


When we had gotten a decent way into the trees, Jamie turned around and looked briefly at my face before casting his eyes to the ground. He rubbed the back of his neck.


Ive actually, like, wanted to kiss you all summer.


I was stunned to silence, absolutely dumbfounded that Jamie had found the guts to say anything like this. I knew I needed to fill the awkward silence left in its wake, so I did the only thing I could think of - I leaned in and kissed him. 


It was the awkward first kiss of two twelve year olds, but it made me feel warm and sent a flight of butterflies swirling into my stomach. So I actually really did like Jamie. How about that?


I let him go and his face was the same shade of red that I imagined mine was. He quickly changed the subject to how long hed wanted to ask me out but that he didnt think I liked him back. We walked for awhile carrying on this conversation, him oblivious to his surroundings, me subtly leading the way. 


It took him stumbling over the tracks to break off his monologue and finally notice the backpack. He looked at me like Id punched him in the face.


You cant be serious.


Jamie, I know but look, this is the last time Im going to see you in a really long time and I want to remember today! We will only be out for two hours max; well be back before they even realize were gone!
Jamie stared at the tracks for a minute and seemed to be considering it all. I held my breath until he finally let out a deep sigh.


Okay.


Oh my God, Jamie, I- He held up his finger, cutting me off.


But we follow the tracks the entire time and we turn around after an hour.


Okay! I was so excited that I hugged him. It would be the first and last time I ever did.


As we walked, we talked about all sorts of mundane things, stopping only to make sure we were still on the tracks. It felt like we had only been walking for 45 minutes but when Jamie checked his watch, it had been 3 hours.


Thats weird.it hasnt been 3 hours. It says its 5 oclock. He trailed off.


I swear, we left just after 2. Its cant be 5, dude, your watch is busted. I gave him a playful shove.


Jamie raised his eyebrow at me and smiled. Even so, we should probably turn around. 


He wasnt wrong, the sun was setting. The shadows were long and looking around, I wondered if it really was 5 oclock. 


But I wasnt ready to give up just yet. As we had been walking, Id noticed something taking shape off of our right; a large mass, maybe a quarter mile away. It was denser than the area around it and seemed to have clean, manmade lines. 


Jamie, look. 


He turned. Yeah, I was hoping you hadnt noticed it. Its a long way off though; we would never find the tracks again.


Yes, we would, check it out! I triumphantly pulled the spray paint out of my backpack. Its for the trees.


He took the can and shook it, then made an experimental x on a nearby tree. 


Ok, but I get to do the spraying. I didnt argue.


The closer we got to the mass, the more it took shape. First we could tell it was a building. Then we could tell it was church.  By the time we got the front door, we were looking at a very old and dilapidated chapel. Remembering my camera, I took a picture of the wooden plaque over the door; whatever had been written on it had long ago worn away. We walked around the church in awe. The building was small, maybe 500 square feet. The windows were, surprisingly, all in tact but were so caked with dirt and grime that we couldnt see anything inside. 


How do we get in? I asked quietly.


I dont know, but were going to figure it out! Wait until my brother hears about this. I mean, holy shit. Look at this place! His excitement was contagious.


The front door had a pull handle but try as we might, we couldnt seem to open the door. 


Do you think its locked? I asked as I watched Jamie struggle with it.


"Yeah, maybe. I mean it must be. There was a door around back, though.

The door at the back was a lot more sympathetic and let us in with relative ease. We were standing in a small room with an old wooden desk attached to a wall. There was a small fire place and old portraits hung up around the tiny office. The people in the pictures were all standing in front of the same maroon background and were looking down at us disapprovingly. Books were scattered everywhere, most in a language I had never seen before. The floor was covered in dirt and a pair of old shoes were laying haphazardly in one corner.


Whoa, I said in awe.


Yeah, whoa. I looked over at Jamie who had a huge smile on his face. He was holding up a cross and a piece of paper.


What is it? I walked over to see.


Its a list of names. Theres like 60 people on this list. Maybe a town census?


Let me see. I pulled my flashlight out of my backpack and shined it on the parchment. 


Deepwood. Do you think thats the name of the town? All these names are crossed out. All except this one. I pointed to a name at the very bottom. 


Maybe it was the plague.


You think its a list of the dead?


Jamie shrugged. Makes as much sense as anything else.


I walked over to the desk and leaned against it. Why do you think they left? I mean, look, theres a jacket or something on that chair, and shoes over there. The town pastor or whatever, he just took off and left everything like this?


Or died, said Jamie as he folded the paper and put in into the back pack. 


Yeah, died Either way it must have been creepy as hell to be alone in here. I stared at one of portraits for several long seconds; the young woman painted there seemed to be staring down at me with a very accusatory look. It made me incredibly uncomfortable. 


I was so absorbed in the paintings that I didnt notice the slow creaking from overhead until the ceiling cracked loudly as it started to cave in. I screamed and covered my head, but the next thing I knew, I was lying on my back over the threshold of a door, Jamie on top of me protecting his head. 


Ah, thanks, I mumbled as I gently pushed Jamie off of me. 


Dont mention it. Jamie climbed to his feet and brushed himself off.
I glanced behind him at the office, which was now filled floor to ceiling with decaying debris. 


Jamie, that was our way out. 


Thats ok. We can unlock the front door now that were inside. Or break one of the windows.


If the back office was unsettlingly, the chapel was downright disturbing.


Even though the grimy windows allowed very little sunlight in, I could make out eight rows of pews lining a narrow aisle and a tall podium at the front of the chapel.


Jamie and I stumbled around the small nave breaking windows on either side with pieces of wood we had found. The sun was still setting and I wondered how much of a difference the muted light would make. When I broke the last window on my side I turned back around to survey the chapel, disappointed that the lighting wasnt much better. The room itself seemed to repel light.


The wooden pews were completely rotted. In fact, the wood we had used to break the windows of the church were leg stands from the front row. The narrow aisle in between the rows of pews was littered with leaves and rotting wood. But that was nothing, nothing compared to what sat upon the alter. 


It wasnt a podium, as I had thought earlier. It was a statue of the crucifixion  but unlike any I had ever seen before. The paint had been worn away on every part of the statue  except the blood of the crucifixion wounds, which stood bright and realistic, and seemed to be oozing before our very eyes. The only other surface left untouched by the decay of time was the face of Jesus. The details of his face were still so incredibly minute and perfect, and he had the same accusing eyes as the portraits in the pastors office. He seemed to be staring directly at me and I could tell Jamie felt the same, though he was across the room from me. 


The statues stare awarded me an edge of panic, and I suddenly realized that we needed to leave. We werent wanted here. I had the sudden feeling that we were trespassing on some sort of hallowed ground. We had found the church, we had documents proving we had been here  and now it was time to go. 


I turned to Jamie to tell him so and could immediately tell that he did not share my feelings. He had been born and bred on these legends and nothing was going to tear him away from our discovery. I watched him walk over to grab the camera out of my bag. He took pictures of everything he deemed interesting, including the crucifixion statue, much to my unease. 


I gave him several minutes before I said something.


Jamie, I think we need to leave. I said in a low voice.


Jamie stopped and looked up, seeming to remember I was there.


Are you kidding? This is what you came for! We have to bring home evidence, of all of it.


Its going to be dark in half an hour. Its already hard to see in here


Duh, thats why Im using a flash. Hey, can you get a picture of me next to this creepy Jesus thing?


UmI guess, I mumbled as I took the camera from him. I didnt even want to look at it, much less photograph it, but if it would help me get him out of here I was going to stomach it. 


Jamie wrapped his arm around it just as I snapped the picture.
Dont touch it! Oh crap, why did you touch it? Theres something off about that thing, Jamie. Can we fricking go now?!


Yeah, fine. Jamie walked over and picked up the backpack as I headed toward the front door.


I noticed there was no lock on it. I pushed against the door as hard as I could - it didnt budge. My heart sank; there wasnt even a handle or a knob. It was just a solid piece of wood with strange markings on it. Symbols I had never seen before. 


Jamie, the door is stuck, I said as I turned around to see him testing a piece of the floor with his foot.


What are you doing? I asked, hearing the edge of panic in my voice. He was still at the front of the chapel, a foot from the Jesus statue hopping back and forth from one part of the floor to another. The statues eyes seemed to be only on him now.


Theres something under here. See? I heard the floorboard creak under his left foot as he put weight on it. 


Jamie, dont.


No, its like, under the dirt right here, the floor is hallow, he kneeled down and starting digging through the thin layer of dirt, its like a trapdoor or something!


And it was indeed a trap door. By the time I had walked the length of the pews, Jamie already had the edges dug halfway out.


Lets just leave it and your brother and his friends can come back and see what it is, please, Jamie, I want to go. There was something wrong with this place. Terribly wrong. And the thought of spending one more minute here had me on the precipice of a panic attack, something I hadnt experienced in over a year. 


I sat down against the front pew and put my head down. I heard a roaring in my ears and my breathing grew labored. I had to leave here, even without Jamie. I rocked back and forth for a few minutes as I tried to calm myself down. I would climb out a window and run  in any direction, it didnt matter.


Theres something here, under the church. Jamies voice sounded a million miles away.


By the time I pulled myself together enough to lift my head, Jamie was knelt next to me.


I didnt know you were claustrophobic. At least, thats what I think Jamie said. I better remember the horror I felt as I stared at the hole in the floor. Jamie had opened the trap door.


Two minutes, Jamie said as he stood up. We go down, we take a couple pictures of whatevers down there and we come right back up and leave. Just two minutes, Katie, thats all Im asking.


I wanted to say no. I intended to. But I felt myself slowly nodding as Jamie pulled me to my feet. To this day I dont understand why I agreed. But I suppose that its better that what happened down there didnt happen to Jamie alone.


Were going to come back with the story of a lifetime! What if there is valuable stuff down there or something? Old shit is always worth money. We could be rich! So rich that your family could stay here. You could buy the house youre living in and come to school with me in September.


I managed a small smile. Of all the things someone could think to buy with wealth, Jamies first thought was to keep me here with him. And he was right, there could be anything down there and almost all old stuff was valuable. I took a deep breath.


Okay, 2 minutes, I agreed.


As we leaned over the trapdoor and peered down, the first thing we noticed was an intense heat emanating upwards from the hole. The second was the strangely out of place spiral staircase leading into the depths below. 


Jamie rolled the flashlight over to me with his foot and I picked it up as he pulled his lighter out of his pocket.


Ladies first, he smirked at me.


I stared at him slack jawed. 


No way. You found this door, YOU go first. Between the black staircase and the heat, I feel like were descending directly into hell. I am not going first. I crossed my arms and glared at him to reinforce my point. 


Jamie simply shrugged and stepped onto the staircase. 


I took several deep breaths as I watched his head disappear into the darkness below. I almost didnt follow him. I was still deciding when he yelled at me to shine the flashlight down the stairs so he could see. 


I started down the stairs after him. They went down much farther than I thought, and it became warmer and warmer the further down we went. 


When we finally reached the bottom, I was holding back what threatened to be a massive anxiety attack. We were farther beneath the church than I thought wed be and it was hot, muggy and difficult to breathe. 


Hoping to get this over with as fast as possible, I swung the flashlight around the chamber hoping to reveal its hidden treasure. What I saw there, I can never describe, though I have tried many times. 

The room was entirely empty, save two things. One was a desk in the corner, much like the one in pastors office. The second was another statue. 


This one was roughly twelve feet tall, and remains to this day the most terrifying thing Ive ever seen. To put it mildly, it was some sort of demon. It towered over us and as such I could only see the bottom of its jaw from where I was. It was looking directly ahead of it, at the staircase we had just descended. Its tail was long and swept around the entire room. There wasnt a lot of room to move. It had claws, like any modern depiction of a demon and as I moved around the chamber to view its profile, I noticed it had horns as well. 


Neither Jamie nor I spoke as we shuffled around room, our backs to the wall as far away from the demon as physically possible. I stepped carefully over the tail as I made my way to its back and came around to the other side of the statue. 


I couldnt take my eyes from it, I couldnt trust it. If the statue upstairs seemed to bleed, what could this one do? As I eyed the talons on the gigantic stone feet, Jamie broke the silence.


Can you even believe this shit? His voice was coming from the other side of the room. I searched the darkness for the weak glow of his lighter and was relieved to see it moving towards me. I turned my flashlight upward to shine it on the side of the demons head. The horns had to be at least a foot tall. As I brought it down to see where Jamie was, I hit my arm on something hard.


Ow, my head! Jamie squeaked as my flashlight fell to the ground and rolled under the desk.


Goddammit, Jamie, I whispered in a panic. I dropped to my knees and felt around under the desk, searching for the flashlight. 


What! Its not my fault you cracked me on the head. 


I stood back up and swung the light around to see Jamie trying to relight his lighter  but it wasnt him that stopped me dead. 


I will forever be frozen in that moment. I dont know why I couldnt speak, couldnt scream, couldnt move. All I could feel was my own intern decent into madness.


As I had moved the beam of light up to Jamies face I had seen another face right next to his. A twisted, angry, soulless face  the demons. The statue had bent down and turned to the side; its head mere inches from Jamies. And it was staring at me. I can not describe its face, and I am not sure my mind will ever let me remember it in detail. 


It shook me to my core in a literal sense. My body was having a dark, violent, visceral reaction to this impossibility. Jamie finally noticed the flashlight shaking in my hand and turned to see what I was looking at. 

It wasnt until he started screaming that I was shaken from my paralysis  I dropped the flashlight, Jamie dropped everything else, and we ran.


We took the stairs 2 and 3 at a time, Jamie pushing me up ahead of him. Halfway up I slipped and we both went tumbling down halfway to the bottom. In that horrible moment we heard the grinding of stone against stone and we knew the statue was moving. Jamie screamed but I was mute, too horrified to make a sound. We got up and kept climbing, never taking our eyes off the small, dying light above us; our only salvation now.


We were almost to the top when we first heard it on the stairs. It was so large and heavy that the entire staircase shook with the impact. Terrified that the stairs would come crashing down and we would be left alone with it below, we jumped the last 3 steps.


Jamie pushed me up out of the opening. He climbed out after me and tried to slam the trapdoor shut but it was somehow stuck.


We could hear a deafening thunder on the staircase as the statue slowly climbed the steps. I helped Jamie try to push the trapdoor closed and for the first time noticed the symbols on the bottom of the wood  the same as those on the front door.


Before I could begin to comprehend this, I noticed the demon first penetrate the shaft of light on the staircase below. It was coming. Jamie saw it too and pulled me to a standing position while pointing at the front door.


We both ran at it as hard as we could  but when we hit it, it didnt budge. We tried again, but it was unsympathetic.


Katie, the windows! We ran to the closest one and tried to climb up the wall to get out, but the windows were too high.


The thunder from below was getting louder, closer. It was more than half way up the stairs


We tried to climb on the rotting pews to reach the windows but they crumbled under our weight.


Ill push you out, give me your foot! Jamie yelled over the sound bellowing from below.


I shook my head. I wanted to, God, I wanted to. But I couldnt leave him. I couldnt leave Jamie to face that thing alone. We both looked over at the door again. Our only chance was to keep trying to break it down. We stumbled back into the aisle and ran at the front door with everything we had. I thought I felt it move. We backed up even further and ran at it again. This time the impact knocked me backwards into the aisle and Jamie barely stayed on his feet. He looked at me in horror and I turned around the see stone horns rising up from the darkness of the trapdoor, 3 feet from where I sat. 


We were going to die here. I stood up, refusing to turn around again. I knew that the next step it took would bring its head into the room, and the thought of seeing its face again had me running at the door with every last bit of strength I had. Jamie reached it at the same time and I felt it give way as we crashed through the threshold and landed outside the church.


Jamie had picked me up off the ground before I could think to move and we were running toward the train tracks at an Olympic sprint. We could still hear the thundering on the stairs no matter how far we got from the church; every step echoed through the woods like a gunshot  until they stopped. It was here.


I had no idea if we had run in the right direction or if we would be forever lost in those woods. It was now dark outside and the temperature was dropping fast. I was beginning to panic that we would never find the train tracks when I noticed Jamie wasnt next to me anymore. I turned around in a panic to find him sprawled on the ground a few yards behind me- he had tripped over one of the rails. He was up and running down the tracks before I could even ask if he was okay. We ran until we couldnt anymore.


Our running eventually slowed to a jog and the jog to a walk. We hadnt spoken  neither of us had any idea what to say  and it wasnt until we had both gotten our breath back that one of us finally broke the silence.


How long have we been on the tracks? Jamies voice had an edge of barely suppressed fear. I looked at his wrist, and noticed his watch was missing.


It didnt take us this long to get, to getto find that place. Or did it? Do you think maybe we went the wrong way? Jamie asked hesitantly.


I couldnt afford to think like that. If we had somehow gotten turned around and ran the wrong way down the train tracks, than we were deeper into the woods than ever.


No. We went the right way, I said to convince myself.


That thing, Jamie started, I thought it was a statue. But maybe it was some crazy undiscovered giant reptile that was, like, hibernating and we woke it up.


So we were going to delude ourselves into thinking that there was a scientific explanation for this. I understood why but I just couldnt accept it.


Yeah, I said slowly, did you, um, did you see the weird writing on the front door? It was on the trapdoor, too. Do you think it was keeping it down there? Because, Jamie, all those doors are open now.


Well, if its an animal, words mean nothing to it, anyway.


Yeah, if I trailed off hoping he would challenge my implication. He didnt.


I could tell this was something Jamies mind wouldnt accept. But he hadnt seen its face, not like I had. It was no animal. It was made of stone. It was something sinister and anciently evil and it had seen me, had seen right down into my soul. It was aware of me and I was aware of it. And now, it was free. Whatever had been keeping it beneath the church has been awkwardly destroyed by Jamie and me. That thing was free to walk the woods and go God knows where. 


We walked in silence for another half hour until Jamie suddenly stopped short and started yelling.


Here! Were here! He booked it down the tracks toward a swarm of flashlights and I followed close behind him. As soon as Jamie reached his parents he collapsed, while I ran into my mothers arms and cried like a child. I couldn't hold it together any longer.


The police report says we were found at 4am  by our sense of time about 3 hours after the sun had set. We had spent less than an hour in the chapel and yet we seemed to have lost 10 hours there. We never told anyone where we had actually been, or that we had found the lost city of Deepwood. We simply said we went for a walk to the lake and got lost in the woods. 


My family left Middlesbrough the following Monday  two days ahead of schedule. My father had another store to open and there was really no reason to wait. Jamie didnt come to say goodbye to me and after we left Middlesbrough I never saw him again. I kept a copy of the police report to remember him.


Over the following year, Middlesbrough slowly disappeared. At first, I could just feel the memory fading unnaturally from my mind. My parents couldnt remember that we had ever been there, which scared me more than anything else. I taped the police report to the ceiling over my bed so that Jamie would be the first and last thing I thought about everyday.  


Then, the Middlesbrough city website disappeared as did that of the local paper and the towns two public schools.


The store my dad helped open in 2002 also disappeared from the companys website. After that I could never find any mention of Middlesbrough anywhere online ever again.


Over the years, I searched public records for Jamies full name and found nothing. I hired someone to illegally search private records and he came up empty too. In the end, the only proof that Jamie ever existed at all was the police report with his name on it.


And then nothing was left.  One day the paper I had had taped to my ceiling for so many years was blank. I remember what it was and what it looked like before, but now its just an old weathered piece of blank paper.


All that remains of Middlesbrough and the people who lived there are my memories. And this is why I am writing this story down and uploading it to the internet. Once its on the internet, it can never die, right? Or perhaps one day it will just disappear and you wont remember ever seeing it and I wont remember ever writing it.


And I can only hope that this ended with Middlesbrough. If it has moved on to other towns, who would know? Who would even remember? 


I wish I had answers. But all I have are questions.

 Boo. 




 It's been a couple years so he's sure coming slow. 




 Yes I posted this a few days ago on AskReddit (I think the question was 'What has made you question reality) and someone linked this subreddit. 




 Dream/stroke/seizure/neuro blip are my only scientific answers. 




 Nada. When this happened I called everybody. 




 Well when I'm on my way somewhere I kinda get tunnel vision so I wasn't really aware of my peripheral vision at that moment. 




 My friend's brother met some people at a party one night. They decided to load up on beer and drive into the desert together to continue getting drunk. They took two cars. 
He passed out in his car and woke up the next morning with no water and the battery missing from his car. They found him dead a few miles away trying to walk towards where he thought town was.  




 See edit. 




 Not what I am saying and weird that you took it there. 




 Maybe. Or maybe said creeper is a pervert who will run away to avoid having dealings with the police.  




 I have a problem with the actions of the woman in OPs story. If a stranger takes close-up photo of my 7 year old for personal use - that's an issue.

 




 But where did the box come from? Was it there when you moved in? 




 In the frame - no problem. 
A close-up photo of my 7 year old that a stranger takes for personal use - problem.  




 Nobody is debating if it's legal! We're debating if it's fucking creepy! 




 And that person can expect a punch in the face.  




 No, in the above it sounded like the woman was taking individual and close up shots of other people's children to bulk up her "portfolio". 




 Tom Cruise. 




 Holy shit! 




 I like this story. It's paced pretty well.

Something I have noticed on /r/nosleep is that longer stories have to work a lot harder for attention. 

For example, my first story did really well. My second story, which I consider much better, didn't even do half as well (it was a lot longer than the first). A lot of people will gauge how long a story is before they decide if they want to read it.

 So maybe if there is anything you can trim from your story, it might earn you more views.

Or if you're like me and refuse to alter your baby, you could just let it ride.  




 Thanks.

 About five years ago my husband and I decided to spend Thanksgiving at a cabin up north. We planned on starting a family the following year and so we wanted one last romantic holiday with just the two of us. We found the place online through a website weve used in the past and booked it for a week. The cabin was located outside of Pinetop, Arizona and the owner warned us that it can be hard to get back to in the winter because of the snow. The property was 13 miles from the nearest town and 4 miles from the nearest paved road. Aaron and I werent worried, however, since our jeep had snow tires and we were also bringing tire chains. 

We arrived on a Friday afternoon. We had made excellent time on the drive as there was actually very little snow on the ground. We decided to take a tour of the cabin before we unloaded the car. The cabin, named Paradise Pine, was three stories tall and built into the side of a mountain. The top floor was simply the master bedroom, which was connected to a third story balcony via a sliding glass door. The front door was located on the second floor, along with the kitchen and living room, and the basement housed another bedroom, a washer, a dryer and a wood furnace that heated the cabin through a large pipe that extended up through all three floors. 

Even though the views through the bay windows were beautiful, the first thing we noticed when we walked in was that the cabin hadnt been cleaned. Often times with very rural properties, the owner will offer to waive the $150 cleaning fee if you are willing to clean the place yourself before you depart. Most guests opt to do this, but in the rare occurrence they dont, the owner sends a cleaning crew.  The previous tenants in this cabin had clearly decided not to clean, and also not to inform the owner that they were leaving it dirty. 
Since it was a holiday and a snowstorm was forecasted for early next week, we decided to clean the cabin ourselves and ask the owner to reduce our bill when we left the following Friday. We brought everything in from the jeep and got to work with dishes and laundry. Afterwards, we made an easy dinner, opened a bottle of wine, and played a few games of billiards on the pool table in the living room. 

The temperature started to plummet at around six in the evening and I asked my husband, Aaron, to go down and light the furnace in the basement. I went up to the bedroom to wash my face and change into warmer clothes. The bathroom connected to our bedroom was oddly door-less, had a broken mirror and a torn-down shower curtain. *Wow, theres been some cowboys in here.* They hadnt even bothered to pick the glass up off the floor before they left. I did so carefully, regretting the stupidity of the drunken idiots who must have stayed here the week before. I took a few photos with my phone and planned to send them to the owner when we got back to town on Monday. I certainly didnt want to be charged for damage inflicted by the previous tenants. 

I met Aaron on the main level of the house and told him about the bathroom. 

Well, thats not the only thing thats broken. The lights out in the basement and I couldnt find a flashlight. I did manage to find the furnace though.  I squirted some of that cheap vodka your sister sent in there, threw in a match and hoped for the best.

Seems to be working, I stammered through now chattering teeth, I can feel the heat coming through. I held my hands up to the metal pipe that wound its way around the house. Keep the basement door closed. Its freezing down there.

One of our favorite things to do when staying at a cabin is to read through all the journal entries of the previous guests. Usually, it was just things like Went fishing with the kids, caught a bass or had a BBQ, played cards with the family, but occasionally you found something more interesting, like got drunk, set a tree on fire.

We found the Paradise Pine diary and snuggled up on the couch. Aaron read aloud the first four or five entries before I decided to take over. We were about halfway through the book when we called it a night and went to bed.

The following evening we stayed up late as we had had a long nap that day. The plan had been to go on a hike but it had been too cold out. Luckily, the furnace in the basement was, to our amazement, still burning. We spent the whole day lazing around the living room. After dinner, Aaron practiced pool while I read aloud from the journal, starting where we had left off. I read for an hour before finally arriving at the journal entry of the guests who had stayed before us. I was very interested in this one; these people had to have a good story. 

The writer had chosen to format his entries into dates with time stamps. There were over 6 pages and I could already tell the handwriting sort of disintegrated as the days wore on. 

Wow, they must have been drunk ALL weekend, look at how messy this handwriting gets! I held the book up to Aaron.

Can you read it? He asked, spinning the 8 ball into a corner pocket.

Of course! Im great at reading other peoples shitty handwriting by now. I sent him an impish grin and took another sip of wine before beginning to read.

**Sunday, Nov 4th   3:30pm**

Wow, what a beautiful cabin! My wife and I booked this place for two weeks on a whim and we cant believe how lucky we got! Barely made it back here with the truck, theres snow everywhere. At least a foot deep. And its below 40 degrees outside  thankfully the furnace in the basement is HUGE, as promised by Marissa, so all three floors are warm and cozy!


**Monday, Nov 5th 11:30am**

Were snowed in! We had wanted to run home today to grab a few things we forgot but that is definitely not happening. The road is unmanageable so it appears we arent going anywhere. Looks like we will be spending most of our day inside drinking mimosas and playing poker. As you can see, we arent too upset about it!


**Tuesday, Nov 6th   7:25pm**

My wife Sarah is currently making roast chicken and Im finally going to start writing. This is the reason we came here, after all, and I refuse waste the opportunity to cure my writers block. Its just so gorgeous here I havent written a damn thing! 

I also saw someone walking around the treeline today. I have no idea how they are surviving out there, we wont even go outside! It was 34 degrees last I checked.


**Wednesday Nov 7th 9pm**

Today Sarah and I made a snow man and snow angels! We dont get snow in Scottsdale, so we are taking full advantage of it. I havent been able to write anything new, but I did edit the previous two chapters of my book.  I think the beauty of this place is just too distracting. Im kidding! (Sort of).

 I think we may have neighbors. I was having a cigarette out on the balcony last night and I saw someone at the treeline again. He is extremely tall.  And certainly close enough to say hello but when I waved he walked back into the woods. Will have to ask Marissa about this? She didnt mention any neighbors nearby.


**Thursday Nov 8th 1pm**

This morning I woke up to find animal tracks all around the outside of the cabin. I dont know what sort of animal made them. The prints were the shape of a rectangle, almost like they were made by the end of a 2x4. By the time Sarah got up at 11, the snow had mostly melted but you could still kinda see them. I think last nights snow is the last we will get while we are here. The sky is looking pretty clear. Sarah thinks I am succumbing to cabin fever, so today we are going for a hike since its so beautiful out.


**Friday Nov 9th 7am**

Last night someone tried to get into the house. I woke up at about 1 in the morning to the sound of banging on the front door. Not knocking, banging. I went downstairs and grabbed a pool stick. I asked who it was and the banging stopped. I waited a few minutes and then opened the door but there was nothing there. I started back up the stairs to wake up Sarah, as she is a heavy sleeper. The banging sounded again, more urgently this time, and from the other side of the room, on the wall next to the bookshelf. It stopped after a long minute and I sat down on the steps and waited all night for them to try something. Nothing happened after that.


**Friday Nov 9th 2pm**

I told Sarah what happened and she wants to leave. Im not really convinced, but Sarah scares easily. I will admit that Im a bit on edge. I tried to start the car this morning but nothing happened. Im not a car guy and I have no idea what to do. We cant hike out, theres no signal out here and we cant find a house phone. We talked about it and decided were just going wait it out here. I know people have this cabin rented out on the 16th so well just have to wait the week for them. I did find a wood axe which Im keeping in the bedroom, just in case they come back to harass us. I think its probably a homeless person living out in the woods. There were tracks around the house again this morning and Im no longer convinced theyre from an animal. Well see if they come back.

**Saturday 5am**

Last night the knocking was back. But it was something knocking on the sliding door to our bedroom  from the second story patio. I dont know how it climbed up there. It knocked on the window, gently, almost coaxingly. A thin curtain covers the sliding glass door so I couldnt see what it was. The knocking finally stopped and a full minute later it started again, becoming the loud, insistent banging of the night before. I reached over Sarah and grabbed the axe, bounding out of bed as she screamed. By the time I got to the sliding door the banging has stopped. I threw back the curtain but there was no one on the patio. In the moonlight, I saw it walking away from the cabin, back toward the treeline. Sarah stumbled over to the window and I showed her the retreating figure. She covered her face and cried. What we saw terrified us both. 

Its not a human. Its tall, maybe 10 feet, and skinny. It looks like a black stick figure, impossibly thin. It has no hands or feet just stumps. And no face. Its just a black oval, with no features. The contrast was horrifying, this tall, black stick man walking through the snow. It reached the treeline and disappeared. I spent the next hour trying to calm Sarah down. She said we need to leave. I think shes right. When we were finally calm enough to lie in bed again, the silence was deafening. I felt myself slowly start to drift off. It was out of this silence that the knocking came again  this time on our bedroom door. I jumped out of bed and grabbed the axe again. Sarah backed into a corner and screamed. By the time I threw open the door the knocking had stopped and there was nothing there, but the front door was wide open. It can get inside the cabin.  I dont know what it wants. 


**Saturday 5pm**

I am terrified. My wife is terrified. Today I considered setting the car on fire, just to see if the smoke would attract someones attention. Sarah wouldnt let me because its our only way out. So we packed the car up instead. Maybe when the snow melts more, well be able to fix the car. I catch Sarah staring off a lot and she hasnt said much since she saw the stick man. Seeing the thing, its affected me too. I have been having migraines today. Ive never had a migraine before. I want to protect my wife but I dont know what to do. I caught Sarah staring at me, almost in a trance earlier. I asked her what was wrong and she said It eats us. She seemed to snap out of it pretty quick after that and asked me why I was staring at her. She doesnt remember saying it and we cant figure out what it means. This thing is fucking with our heads. 


**Sunday 10am**

Last night I stayed up all night. Its lightly snowing. All was quiet.


**Sunday 7pm**

I found footprints this afternoon on the upstairs balcony. The same rectangle ones the stick man makes. He was outside our window again. I brushed them away before Sarah could see. It stopped snowing an hour ago and its twilight now. I can see him in the treeline. I saw him turn around and walk back into the woods. His profile is as thin as a piece of paper. The stick man came back, though. I think were going to die here.


**Monday Nov 12th  9am**

 Last night I went out on the balcony at around 8 for a cigarette. I heard a noise behind me and turned to see the stick man on the roof, 5 feet above me. I ran back inside to grab the axe and screamed at Sarah to arm herself. I turned around to run back outside and heard the stick man running above me on the roof, in the same direction. When I got outside, the thing was gone. I saw it running off into the trees again. But it was different. It was taller. I think theres more than one. 
When I got back inside, Sarah had locked herself in the upstairs bathroom. She was hysterical and kept saying she was going to die here. I tried to give her the pool stick but she wouldnt open the door for anything. I sat on the bed and waited. At some point Sarah must have fallen asleep because all was quiet. It was then that I first heard it walking around in the kitchen. I backed away from the bedroom door, courage suddenly failing me. It was in the house. I waited for more sounds from the kitchen but none came. After a few minutes, I finally heard a thump. It was on the stairs. It was climbing the stairs.

Thump. Slowly, but loudly. Thump. I banged the bedroom door from my side and told it to leave us alone. Thump. Sarah was screaming again, sobbing. It could hurt me, but I would never let it hurt my family. It stopped when it got to the top step. I could feel it on the other side of the door. It didnt make a noise. I tried to think of a strategy that would give me the upper hand if it attacked. I finally decided that if I threw the door open, it would knock the stick man down the stairs. On the count of three I turned the handle and kicked the door. It swung open freely, and I saw the black stick man still down on the landing of the stairs, facing me. It was more than 10 feet tall. I was paralyzed with horror for several long seconds when it started running up the stairs at me without warning. I stumbled back into the room as fast as I could as I realized that death at the hands of the stick man was more than death. Worse than death. It ate you. It kept you.

It stopped at the top step and dipped it head through the door taking 2 steps into the room. It was just a tall black shadow. Almost more of a dense absence of light than a solid black. Realizing the axe was still in my hand I moved between the stick man and the bathroom door. I raised the axe to attack, and at that moment the stick man screamed. It was unlike anything I had ever heard before. I wanted to hold my hands over my ears as I felt an ebbing thunder in my brain. I heard the mirror shatter in the bathroom from the sound. I thought of Sarah. With the last ounce of strength I had I ran at the thing, axe high and brought it down in the creatures chest. Over and over again for what felt like forever but was probably no time at all. It threw me aside and I heard my wife scream. Thats the last thing I remember before I passed out. 

When I opened my eyes again it was mid-morning. My wife was gone. The bathroom door was gone. And the axe was gone. I looked for Sarah all morning; I walked deep into the woods. I searched for miles. I am going to sleep for a few minutes and then go back out into the woods to find her. I hope I meet the stick man. If Sarah is dead, I want to be dead too. I think thats what it wanted all along. 


**Monday Nov 12th 6pm**

Its getting dark and harder to search the woods. In my mind, all I hear is her voice. *It eats us.* Over and over again. What has it done to her. 

I couldnt save her. After everything, I couldnt save her. When I first realized I had forgotten my medication, the snowstorm stopped us from leaving. But when I saw the stick man I thought it had been a blessing in disguise. I needed to be clear-minded and alert to protect my family, and I couldnt do that when I was on the Haloperidol.  But it didnt matter in the end anyway. I couldnt save her.

 The car started on the first try this morning. Its letting me leave.  Im going to drive around to the other side of the mountain and walk back towards the cabin. Maybe Ill find the stream. Maybe Ill find Sarah. It would be useless to stay another day, the stick man is gone. I know it in my heart. And its below freezing and the furnace has burned out, the firewood is gone. If I find her Ill come back and write in this book. My only friend, now.

Aaron had stopped playing pool long ago and the wine hadnt been touched since I started reading. We stared at each other as the last words of the diary soaked into the air. We both seemed to wake from our paralyzed state at the same time. I threw the book across the room and Aaron backed up into the bookcase saying Jesus!

This is fake, right? I asked as I stood up. I didnt need the glass of wine anymore. I needed the bottle.

I dont know, Linds, I dontI dont think so. 

The guy said he was a writer, I insisted, he probably just wanted to write a scary story for other guests. Although he really crossed the line into downright disturbing. I took a sip of wine and turned around to see Aaron eyeing the stairs, warily.

 You cant be serious, Aaron. Its creepy as shit, I agree, but come on.

Almost like he didnt hear me, Aaron started ascending the stairs. I dont know what he wanted to see up there, but I put the wine down and followed him. By the time I got into the bedroom Aaron was sliding the glass door open. I followed him out onto the balcony. You could see the treeline from the patio very clearly. I searched the woods for any movement but saw nothing. I turned to say something to Aaron and found him studying the roof. He threw a wild look at me and walked back inside. I followed him in.

Aaron paced around the room.
 
What?! I was starting to get annoyed.

Its all just like in the story. You can see the treeline, the field and the roof from the balcony. And look-

He pointed to the attached bathroom.

-there are hinges but no door. There should be a door, its a bathroom. And the mirror- 

What? I interjected. Was shattered by the stick mans scream?! He was starting to scare me. Aaron was usually the most logical person I knew. 

The stick man? Did you even pay attention to what you read? There was no stick man.

No shit.

No, I mean, there never was. His last entry, about the medication - and how they got snowed in and couldnt go back for it  Haloperidol, its used to treat schizophrenia. Lindsey, go read it again. The entire thing is him slowly succumbing to his psychosis, page by page. Hell, his wife knew it was happening!

This is madness, Aaron. I walked into the bathroom and looked around. You think someone died in here? Four days ago?

Aaron shook his head. I dont know. I think its a possibility. The shower curtain is torn down, the mirror is broken. It certainly looks like there could have been a struggle in here. And the doorthe axe.both missing.

The logic of his conclusions began to dawn on me.

Oh my God, if this is real Aaron, we cleaned this place top to bottom when we got here. If there was a murder, weve destroyed all the evidence!

We didnt know. We didnt know that someone died here-

We still dont know.  Aaron, wheres the body?

I dont know. Maybe its buried out in the woods.

We need to leave; we need to go get help. Lets take the book to the police and tell them what we found when we got here. Just to be safe.

Okay. Okay, Jesus, this guy could come back anytime. Lets get out of here.

We had just started down the stairs when another thought occurred to me. I stopped on the landing.

Aaron

He turned around, Yeah?

He said the fire in the furnace had burned out. Did you put firewood in when you lit it?

Noit was almost pitch black. I couldnt see any firewood.

ButWeve been burning that furnace for almost a day.

I could see the implication slowly dawning over Aarons face.

What have we been burning, Aaron?

He ran for the basement door, and I followed. When he opened the door, I cant describe to you what came up from below. It was a hot, pungent, heavy air. I stood on the top step as Aaron descended into the basement.

The axe is down here.
 
I took a deep breath and followed him down. I stopped on the bottom stair, refusing to go any further. It was still very dark but for the light coming down the stairs and a soft orange glow in the back of the room. Aaron knelt in front of the stove door. He looked over at me and I nodded. Aaron slowly turned the handle and pulled open the furnace door. The fire inside lit his face and after moment, the horror expressed there told me everything I needed to know.

They found Jason Harding less than a day later. He had hung himself out in the woods, 50 yards from the cabin. In fact, he had been hanging there when we pulled up on Sunday, the 18th of November. Ive often wondered if he hung himself because he wanted to be with his wife, or if he hung himself because he realized what he had done.

 I hoped it was the latter because I hated him so much. Not for his mental illness, not for his crime  but for what he did to us. Sarah Harding had burned in that furnace for a day, and for a day, we had breathed in every atom of her body. We had kept warm by the flesh of her corpse. Why didnt it smell? We were given a very scientific explanation citing high burning temperatures, years of pine infusion, and the pieces of wooden door burning in there with her. But it didnt stop the nightmares.

The case made headline news, at least locally. Aaron and I managed to prevent our names being associated with Paradise Pine through an anonymity clause on our witness statements.  We never told our friends or families we were involved. We tried to forget. 
 
Paradise Pine still stands today. It is available for rent, although the name has been changed. The owner insisted on keeping the cabin journal, so the police tore out Jason Hardings pages and gave it back to her. It still sits on the table next to the bookshelf, and tenants still read it and write in their own experiences. 

I pity those people. They will wonder about the torn pages and never learn what was written on them. They will cringe at the door-less bathroom and never know someone was murdered there. They will light the basement furnace and never realize its dark history. 

And they will never know that the quiet, charming, peaceful cabin theyre staying in is actually the Paradise Pine.

 Like most people these days, I had a fucked up childhood. Who doesn't, right? My father took off before I was born and my mother was left to care for me on her own, a skill she was sorely lacking.  My mother slipped right back into the drug-addled, party lifestyle shed enjoyed before I was born and had soon turned our two-bedroom apartment into an opium den. 

For the first five years of my life, I walked around in a confused, terrifying mist. The smoky air would flood down the hallway from our living room and slip under my bedroom door. It always seemed to linger for days.


I know now that my mother wasn't a bad person, just a victim of her addictions. When she did have spare money, she would put food in the house or buy me clothes from Goodwill. The only pieces of furniture I had in my bedroom was a mattress set and a little blue and white toy chest. Not that I had a lot of toys to put in it, of course, just the three I had gotten for birthdays: one was an art kit, one was a red wagon, and the last, my pride and joy, was a doll named Betsy.


Betsy was my best friend. We would have imaginary tea parties together, sleep together, and even take baths together. Sometimes, I even remember her voice.


When I thought back on my conversations with the doll in adulthood, I realized that I was likely suffering from delusions, thanks to the always present butts of smoke that laid claim to the dingy hallways and drafty bedrooms of our small apartment. 


Still, I remember the sound of her voice: a pleasant, tingling lilt that was almost always coupled with a raucous giggle. I also remember the things that she said to me and the things she wanted me to do. She asked me to steal, usual food or pens and pencils. She wanted me to bring her forks and knives and hit the bad man who slept on our couch. It was always something and I would always get in trouble. But she wouldnt. When I told my mother who had put me up to these games she would scoff and shake her head. She never believed me. Adults never do.


Around my 6th birthday I asked my mother for a birthday party. I wanted to invite the mean girls from school and serve them cake and ice cream to make them like me. I remember standing in the kitchen that day with such hopes, having just asked the most important question of my entire life. The glass bottle of coca-cola I held was shaking in my nervous hands. I waited with bated breath as my mother continued putting groceries away, almost as if she hadnt heard me. But I knew she had. Finally, just as I had failed a second time to muster the courage to repeat my question, she turned around and gave me a flippant shake of her head.


"A birthday party? Laura, that's ridiculous, I can't afford to feed 15 children that aren't even mine. Hell, I can barely afford to feed you! You eat like an elephant, especially for a girl your size. Or, Im sorry, Betsy does. There's barely anything left for me to eat around here, much less a classroom of other peoples brats."


My face fell as she shook her head, mumbled something else under her breath and stumbled off into the living room. I heard the music go up then as more people walked in the door. Some left, some stayed; I never knew them either way. 


It simply wasn't fair, my mother threw parties all the time. What about me? I was a kid! All my friends had birthday parties and now the mean girls at school would know I was too poor to have one and they would tease me even more.


I felt tears start to well in the corners of my eyes and I choked back a sob while I ran to my room and slammed the door behind me. Betsy was lying on the bed and smiling. She was always smiling. Usually it made me feel better but today it just made me angry. She just kept staring at me, smiling. She was going to tell me to do something bad, again. This was why mother wouldn't throw me a birthday party. It was because of all the trouble I got into because of her. This was her fault! Betsy didn't have to go to school and Betsy never got in trouble like I did. And in my young mind, I truly believed it was the doll, not my mother, who was to blame for everything.


I snapped then. I screamed in indignant rage and I threw the bottle as hard as I could at the bed. It hit Betsy on her forehead and she fell on the floor. Good. I picked up the bottle and I hit her again and again. I thought I heard her laugh and I hit her harder. Then I laughed. When my rage was spent, I dragged Betsy to my toy chest and threw her in. I slammed it shut and kicked the chest against the wall; I never wanted to see Betsy again - ever.


I never owned another doll after Betsy. About a week later the police came and two nice ladies took me to live in a new home in a new state, with food and toys and no drugs. The trunk went into storage and the wagon disappeared. I never saw my mother again. As I got older, my foster parents admitted she was in jail, doing 25 years. That was fine with me; I felt nothing for her anyway. I still had nightmares because of my life with that woman. But then slowly, I began to heal. I focused on doing well in school and I ignored my mothers letters from prison. She reached out to me several times in my 20s, as well, but I always declined her calls.


That is, until this morning. Im 30 now, with my own children and a loving, honest husband. I have a beautiful house, two dogs and a career as a social worker trying to make a difference for kids who had it bad like me. Im happy, Im steady, and Im content. So when I got a voicemail from my mother informing me she had been paroled and that she wished to speak, decided to let her say her piece.


Since the kids were home from school I went out into our shed in the backyard to return my mother's call. The shed was the children's domain and they used it to play in the summer. I sat on my old toy chest which was currently being used as tea party table and dialed the number she had left me.


Three rings.


"Hello? Laura?"


"Hello, mother. How are you?"


"Oh Laura, thank you for speaking to me. I know you have your own life now and a family. I would love to meet them someday! I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am. For everything."


"Mother, you are not meeting my kids - ever. And since you called me, I am going to what I have needed to say for years. The opium, the heroin, they destroyed you. And the worst of it is that you almost took me down with you. I was five. That was no home for a child.  Honestly, Im surprised it took you so long to get caught."


Laura, I know how it seems, but I honestly know nothing! Look, it hardly matters and I do understand why you would feel that way. Why you would hate me and not want me to meet your little ones. I learned a lot about forgiveness while I was away and just...oh Laura, I am so sorry about Betsy."


"Betsy?" I paused, confused. "Why would you care about her?"


I know, Laura, believe me I do. It was all my fault, the drugs, the partying. And Betsy, oh God, if I had only paid attention, if I had only known. She's gone and it's because of me.


As my mother began to cry, I tapped my fingers on the toy box, impatiently. The drugs had clearly fried her brain.


"Mother, I sighed. Why are you talking about Betsy? And why do you even care? I know where Betsy is." Right underneath me.


"What are you talking about, Laura? Oh God, where is she?!"


I shifted uncomfortably. "Well...Betsy's in the trunk, where shes always been."


There was a beat of stunning silence.


"What do you mean your sister's in the trunk?"


"Sister? What the hell are you talking about? Back on drugs so soon? 
Thats a record, even for you.  Betsy is a goddamn doll. I locked her in my toy box a few days before you got arrested for possession."


"Laura.. oh God, no...no... Laura, what have you done? I wasn't arrested because of the drugs, Laura, I was arrested because of Betsy's disappearance! You always called her your little doll, but we thought you knew! Oh God. We thought you knew. Laura, no, what have you done to my baby?!"


My mind had gone blank and with no emotion I set the phone down next to me and stood up. I could hear the muffled sound of my mother's anguished cries and feel the dark clutch of possibility in my own chest. Memories were stirring in the back of my mind, threatening to flood forward into my consciousness. They pushed against a door in my mind that had been locked so tightly for so long that I had forgotten it was even there.


Was it even possible? Could the trauma and the opium have really led me to believe that a small child was actually doll? Begging for food and utensils to eat with, asking me to protect her from the bad man?


No...


I slowly turned around and brought my eyes down the makeshift tea party table. Surely, it was too small; you couldn't fit a person in there. You couldn't. But then, what about a very small, starving, emaciated child? What about her, would she fit? Would an investigator even bother looking for a person in this chest? I knew I wouldnt. It was just too small. And I was sure we had opened the toy box at some point over the years, hadnt we? Or had something swimming in the dark recesses of my memories always stopped me? I couldnt remember ever seeing it open.
I knelt down to the ground and opened the clasps. It would be better to not look. After all that I had overcome, this new life that I had earned for myself. It could all be undone by opening this toy box. I shouldn't open it. I should throw it in a landfill and forget it ever existed. I should not look inside...



I opened the chest.


I never had a doll. My mother never could afford to buy me one. I never had a wagon either, for that matter. But I did have a toy box; a pretty, blue and white toy box. And when I was five, I beat my little sister to death and put her in it.

 Here's the one I wish I'd never read. 

These boys are free now under new identities. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_James_Bulger 




 The patty-cake scene in Who Framed Roger Rabbit.  




 From Goonies, I didn't realize until I was an adult why my dad always laughed at One Eyed Willy.  




 The visuals here are stupendous.  




 So true, it hurts. 




 I promise to never, ever watch that.  




 I've heard the Daniel Pearl video is awful too, but I've never seen it. And I never will. 




 That...that was awful. 




 Can someone provide a summary? 




 Just image search it.  




 [Nope.](http://imgur.com/PRwwHpU) 




 I once googled "Alaskan Pipeline" at work. Most results were safe but the ones that weren't. Shudder. 




 So much this. My most popular story is the one I wrote during a thirty minute lunch break. And the one I spent the most time and energy on actually did the worst.   




 That was amazing. 




 When my brother and I were kids we found a delivery pizza warmer out in the woods that said "Reward if Found" on it. We spent all afternoon talking about what we would buy with our millions to all of our friends.
Instead we got a free pizza.

 I've waited four months for an update to [this one](http://as.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1sbbsg/the_ultrasound_part_2/).  




 This was my idea as a kid too :(

 Because relationships are like garage sales. At a distance it looks like it could be interesting, but up close it's just a ton shit you don't need. 




 I was at Wrigley Field the night of the [Bartman Ball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bartman_incident). After the game I watched a mob chase his police escort down the street. 




 I came here to make sure someone corrected the *isle.* 




 I don't know know the specifics, but I believe the police had narrowed down the suspects and he was one of them. I think they got a warrant. 

As for how much my mother knew... I just don't know. She was not involved in the trial for some reason and whenever I ask about her the staff here are very vague.  




 When you grow up with something your whole life, you just never think it's weird. When I was younger I knew there was another room there. As I got older, I trusted my parents more and my instincts less.  




 I haven't looked into it much as I just can't take it, but they were gagged somehow. One person managed to scream at one point but that scream was cut off very...abruptly.  




 I believe they stopped making noise when they heard my dad's voice yelling at them. If I were experiencing what went on on the other side of that wall, I would have listened to him too.  




 Yes. The scratching that terrified me all my life was people resigned to death, carving their last word to their families into the wall.  




 This actually means a lot. That story took the most out of me to write and is my favorite but it doesn't seem to get a lot of notice on Nosleep.  




 He was arrested and I gave testimony at his trial. Whether or not he was arrested at the house that night or elsewhere, I don't know. If he was, he'd been carted away by the time I got home. 




 He was caught, arrested and is currently on death row. But, no, I will never see him again. 




 He was caught and arrested. Whether he was arrested at home or elsewhere I'm not sure. He had been taken away by the time I showed up. He is currently on death row.  




 If I knew how to break into that - I totally would. And thank you! 




 I do complex math in my head for no reason.  




 We've always lived at 423 Stockholm Street, so there really wasn't ever a time that I didnt hear the creature. Hed been living in the room on the other side of my wall since I was born.

When I was a very young child, I thought He was my friend. I would knock and He would bang back. I would giggle and He would mumble words to me that I couldnt understand. I thought He was there to protect me from my nightmares. But as I got older, I started to be afraid. My parents insisted that there wasnt a room on the other side of my wall. Over time, I realized that He wasnt my friend at all. Thats when the scratching, moaning and sporadic banging began to scare me.

When I was eight I finally broke down and told my parents about the creature in my wall. I was terrified that He would come into my room one night and kill me. My mother rolled her eyes and told me it was mice. She never listened to me, anyway. My father agreed with her that it was animals, but he hugged me and told me he would protect me and not to be scared.

So from then on whenever I'd hear the noises I would scream for my father and he would come running into my room less than a minute later to see what the matter was. I would point at the wall and cower. My dad would smile, bang on the wall with his fist and say: "Quiet down in there or else!" The noise would stop, Id give my dad a teary smile and he would hug me. He was always my protector. I miss him so much, now.

As I matured into a teenager I started inviting my friends to sleepover. They didnt believe my stories at first but after one night in my room - they were convinced. We called ourselves the Stockholm Street Ghostbusters and we spent hours trying to exorcise the entity (a demon, according to our research) through awkward sances and Ouija boards. We decided that the scratching must be the creature etching satanic sigils and drawings into the other side of my wall.

One slumber party, running on heightened bravado and caffeine, I waited until the familiar scratching started and I pounded on the wall, just like my dad. 

"QUIET DOWN IN THERE OR ELSE. YOU'RE ALREADY DEAD. THE LIVING ARE TRYING TO SLEEP!" 

We giggled and my friends were impressed - for a moment. I should have known not to provoke him. 

Suddenly there was an answering enraged banging on my wall, louder than Id ever heard, and a sort of angry yelling. We all screamed and hid in the closet, yelling for my dad. When he came running, my friends begged him to take them home. I was left alone while they were gone. I could feel Him, almost see Him impatiently pacing behind the wall, back and forth, 5 inches of wood and wallpaper between He and I. I was so scared that I stayed hidden in the closet. Then the scratching started again.

That was when I realized what it was doing: it was trying to carve its way through the wall and into my bedroom. I whimpered at the thought and then scratching stopped and the banging resumed on the walls. It didn't stop again until the headlights of my dad's car lit up my room. I cried until my dad, always the hero, came sprinting into my room and banged on the wall. 

Its still in the walls, Dad! I wailed.
	
He nodded, gave me a pitying look and pounded his fist on the demons wall. "Quiet down in there or else!" 

Then he held me, let me cry out my fears, and told me it was okay if I slept on the sofa that night. Sometimes I thought he believed it was all in my head. But it wasnt. The murmurs, the knocking, and the scratching, Id been hearing it all my life. It was real. But if he didnt believe he never let on and never made me feel crazy. He just played along. I guess I never really understood my dad. 

One night when I was 16, I was awoken by an otherworldly, ear-splitting scream. It was so loud, so high and so piercing that I screamed as well, in terror. The scream ended abruptly then and a moment later my dad came running in.

"You heard it!" I cried as my body wracked with sobs. "How could you not hear it? You had to have heard it."

"Oh sweetie." My dad sat at the end of my bed, his hair disheveled and a far-off look in his middle-of-the-night, bloodshot eyes. "Of course I heard it, but it was just an owl, I'm sure of it. We've been seeing a few in the neighborhood."

"No dad, listen to the walls." 
Lindsey-

Please, Dad.

He sighed but nodded and we sat and listened for awhile. I needed my dad to know the truth and to finally believe me. We were all in danger.
But no more sounds came from the wall that night.

I didn't hear Him again after that, not for a long time. The wall suddenly felt empty to me for the first time in my life. Maybe it was dormant or maybe it had been called back to Hell. But either way, I knew it would be back.

Oddly, when the creature did return I didn't really notice at first. After 16 years it was simply white noise to me: a background soundtrack as familiar to me as my own face. It took so long for me to process that it was back that I cant put my finger on when it actually started. I think that's what sealed our fates, in the end. The noises were just so inherent to me that I failed to understand how unusual they really were, and had been all along. When I finally did realize what I was hearing I'm ashamed to say I felt almost relieved. 

The haunt progressed in the same cycle it had all my life. First, the groans, then the banging, then light, lazy tapping, and then, finally, the scratching, always the scratching. 	

I'd told my dad about the scratching, and about how I thought the creature was trying to rip through the wall and into my room. My dad laughed and told me there were 3 inches of solid metal on the other side of my wall and that nothing; not mice, raccoons, feral cats or even ghosts could come through my wall. And he should know, he'd built the house himself. And besides, he assured me, he would always be there to protect me. But in the end, he wasn't.

Since I was moving out in a year, I decided I had no choice but to just stick it out. After 16 years with Him, what was 12 more months? I grew unconcerned, lazy, and complacent. I ignored the noises, even started to bang back, again. I used logic to pacify my fear: whatever it was, it couldn't come through the wall. If it could, it would've done so years ago. And I sensed that more than anything else in the world, it wanted OUT. And since it was still in there, obviously, it was trapped. And I was right.

The night the door was opened is the most vivid memory I have. I was at a friend's house when my mother called me and told me to come home immediately. This, in itself, was strange as my mother barely even acknowledged me and never, ever called me.

I drove the 5 miles back to my neighborhood but I had a hard time getting in. I started to panic as I desperately weaved through all the media vans, police cars, and SWAT trucks. I had to park and walk the final three blocks to my house, tears rolling down my cheeks as I realized that my street was at the epicenter of it all. Because I knew. As soon as I saw my house, I realized it - my dad must be dead. It had finally gotten out and it had killed my dad.

I took off at a dead run then, ignoring all the voices yelling at me to stop. I dodged in between the vehicles, pushing past dozens of people, ran through the crime scene tape and directly into my house - and there it was. Across from the living room, next to my bedroom, the hall closet stood with its door open. All the jackets and sweaters had been pulled out of it and on the back wall I saw it - another door.
For whatever reason, no one stopped me. I stumbled into the closet, through the hidden door, and out into the room I'd always known was there. But it wasn't what I thought it'd be.

The media called my dad The Skinner of Stockholm Street. And from what I saw in that room, it was a very fitting name. There were knives, all sorts really. And there were metal devices stacked along one wall, at least a hundred of them. Most I didn't recognize, but a few I had seen in history books. There were 4 set of manacles, a wall of chains and rolls of duct tape. In the middle of the room there was a flat table which was, very clearly, blood soaked. A tall stool sat at the head of the table.

But the worst of it was the wall - my wall. Every inch of it was covered in carvings. But the carvings weren't satanic or evil like I'd thought. 
The carvings were words.

*Jacob, I love you. Diana Hobb*

T*ell my father I forgive him. Brian Woodlin*

*Tara, I'm so sorry. Michael Mcnulty*

*Tell my daughters they were my world. Angela Waterstone*

According to the evidence file there were over 60 of these messages. And I made myself read every single one. They haunt me every night. I had spent ten years tormenting them and they would now forever torment me.

I live in a hospital now and I can still hear the scratching. Every time I close my eyes, I hear it. I haven't really slept in a year. My doctor says if I dont sleep soon, Ill die. I spend my days watching news coverage of my father's trial, and I spend my nights staring at the walls. The drugs don't work, but they keep giving them to me anyway. And though I try every night, I can never fall asleep. I always hear the scratching. And I always will.

 I had a layover in Kyoto, Japan and had met some other backpackers on the plane who also had a layover. The 5 of us went out and ate dinner, had some booze and pretty much just started walking around the city looking for a bar we wouldn't embarrass ourselves in. 

Suddenly this giant bus (like a coach) rolls up and the bus driver asks us if we'd like to go to a bar. For whatever reason we decide to go and get on the bus. We are all handed one beer each and went to sit down at the back of the bus. There was a TV mounted to the roof and people were passing around a microphone singing karaoke. 

We got to someplace kinda rural and piled off the bus. It was like a few semi trailers that had been stacked together, the walls broken down in between them, and cheap wooden panels mounted everywhere. But other than that it was a regular bar with tables, chairs and, of course Karaoke. Most people there were Westerns. We had a lot of fun and got pretty drunk. Took a taxi home.

Through the course of the night we did learn that the "bar" was created for the flight crews of European and American airlines so that they would have somewhere to drink in Kyoto.

The whole thing was pretty surreal. 




 Not literally. 




 No other buildings that we could see, but I'm assuming that's because the church couldn't vanish, due to it being the "cage" of the statue.
 




 No, I wasn't..

 In Arizona, I can confirm this happens. I went to NAU and our bonfire parties were busted all the time in a similar manner (minus helicopter).

 I got into a pretty bad t-bone with my 5 years old daughter. The other driver was drunk and tried to run - as did the 2 other people in his car - so the police were very busy. My daughter and I were ok enough to climb out of the car, but I was an absolute wreck. Shaking etc.

This woman who had seen the accident came to talk to us and saw the state I was in. She ran back to her house and came back with bottles of water, stuffed animals and a coloring book with crayons for my kid. 

This lady totally saved the day. It calmed us both down until the cops could come deal with me and what was left of my car.She kinda disappeared and I'm still sad I didn't get to thank her.

 You know, I actually researched the Watchmen quote and learned that it originated anonymously long before the Watchmen comics and that the writers, in fact, have no idea where it came from. Very odd stuff.

 If you are ever in Arizona and find yourself on the Interstate-17, pay attention when traveling through a town called Black Canyon City. With a population just over 2,000, and nothing to recommend it to highway travelers but a small gas station, most people will blow right by this little community without a second glance. But if you slow down and look to the West of the highway, you may see a dilapidated, crumbling building with the simple words "DOG (C)RACK" written on the side in faded, orange lettering. 


You have found the Black Canyon City Dog Track, the site of one of the worst massacres in Arizona history. The property has remained derelict and neglected since the 80's, slowly rotting away on the hilltop where it was once a thriving den of debauchery. 


If you were to exit the highway and park on the corner of Maggie Mine Rd and Coldwater Canyon you could walk to the abandoned building and explore the stale, decaying ruins of a once popular greyhound track.


If you approach the side of the building with the fading orange letters you will see a silver gate standing open. If you venture through you will come to an unlocked door into the building.  If, by chance, you are on the north side of the building, you will instead find a smaller doorway, this one with the door torn off the hinges. Graffiti to the left of this door reads "Why didn't you kill yourself today?" 	


If you then venture inside, you will find yourself in a cavernous, crumbling lobby. You will find a booth for reservations, a wall of betting windows and even a bar. Beyond that, you can explore the kennels, the private offices of the management, and even the overgrown dog track below.


Of course, one of the first things you'll see are the grandstands; rows and rows of red and yellow plastic seats, many of them still attached, while others have been torn up and thrown in an unceremonious pile nearby. This part of the building has an unsettling feeling as thousands of seats, all eerily expectant, face an empty field of weeds and a small mountain range beyond through large, broken panoramic windows. A large, metal sign hanging above tells you that the red seats cost 50 cents while the yellow seats cost 75.


If you continue to wander, you will find more graffiti such as "Who watches the Watchmen?" and "His name was Robert Paulsen". You will no doubt finish your tour feeling unsettled and ill, and with good reason.


The story of this dog track is mysterious and difficult to find, having been all but erased from history. After doing over a years worth of research, I believe I have learned enough to warrant writing this article.


Our story begins with a citrus farmer named David K. Funk. In 1942, tired of his Phoenix farm, Funk opened a successful race track in Tijuana called "Caliente Race Track", which was the first combination horse/dog track in North America. 


It was enormously successful and with his new found wealth, Funk moved his wife and four young children - Albert, Charlotte, Richard and David Jr. - back to Arizona and opened several more thriving greyhound tracks. 


The Funk children grew and while Albert and David Jr. followed in the family business, Charlotte and Richard showed little interest and went off on their own paths. Charlotte married a young entrepreneur named Monte Kobey and Richard became a university professor. 


David Jr. and Albert moved around the country opening tracks in Florida, Oregon and Colorado. David Sr., impressed by his son's excellent work ethic, named David Jr Vice President of the Arizona race tracks, of which there were five. 


David Jr., an aggressive but inexperienced businessman, decided in 1965 to open a new greyhound track in central Arizona. He choose a sleepy, rural town called Black Canyon City, less than an hour north of Phoenix. 


When his father wouldn't approve the funds to build this track, David Jr. found funding through a Delaware company called Western Racing Inc., a well known mob-run enterprise on the east coast.


With their help, Black Canyon City Dog Track was opened in 1967, much to the chagrin of the locals, a devoutly religious group, who were horrified to find their pious town host to such a sinful sport. 


David Jr. brought his sister and her husband to live in Black Canyon City and oversee the track's management. Charlotte's husband Monte was interested in greyhound racing and so Charlotte found herself once again enslaved to the family business. She noted in her diary that year how much she hated dog racing and how much she resented her family for forcing this life on her. 


The track was an enormous success despite local protests and harassment by the town's small police force. Gamblers from Phoenix would drive up on the weekends to get out of the heat and spend time drinking and betting at the greyhound track.


In 1973 David Jr left Arizona to open a new property in Las Vegas, leaving Monte and Charlotte behind to run the Black Canyon track. Charlotte strongly objected to being "abandoned in the middle of nowhere" but Monte was excited about the chance to run the business alone.


David Jr. didn't return to Black Canyon City until early in 1982, when Charlotte called him to complain about the increased tensions between locals and track management. In the years he had been gone, the protests had turned to vandalism, death threats and finally violence after a flaming bag weighted with a brick was thrown through his pregnant sister's window. 


Monte and Charlotte argued to shut the track down, citing violence and poor profit margins. David Jr. would not agree to it. He was by this time deeply in debt to Western Racing and they were no longer asking nicely for their money. The threats had grown so violent that David Jr. showed up in Arizona with his humerus broken in three places.


When her brother refused to release the Kobey's from their obligations, Charlotte begged David Jr. permission to leave, telling him about a local man who was harassing her named Brad Davidson. She said she didn't know him and had no idea why, but that he followed her when she was alone and came to the track everyday to try and speak with her. He was an alcoholic and a gambler, she said. In April, a man accosted David Jr. in the street claiming to be Brad Davidson, and pleaded with him for help, claiming he was the real father of Charlotte's baby.


In May of 1982, Monte and David Jr. got into a violent fist fight in the management offices when the latter went through the track's accounting.  David Jr. accused Monte of running the track into the ground due to gross financial mismanagement. David Jr. was so angry that he told Monte about his conversation with Brad Davidson. Monte broke the cast off his brother-in-law's arm.


David Jr. was taken to the hospital to have his arm reset but the local ER staff refused to help him because he was the man who had brought the very devil himself" to their town. Police were called and they escorted David Jr. off hospital property, roughing him up a bit. They told him that crime in their community had gone up ten fold since he had "invited all the sinners" down upon them.


The following month, David Jr. received another convincing threat from Western Racing to ruin him and decided on one last ditch effort to revive the track.  Attendance had dwindled to almost nothing due to patrons being harassed and assaulted by locals as they came and left the dog track. 


David Jr. bought adspace in Phoenix and Tucson and advertised the "comeback of the century" for the failing business. On July 10th of that year, all patrons of the track would not only receive $10 in betting credit but also drink for free between 11am and 1pm. Much to Charlotte and Monte's disappointment, the response was overwhelming.


When the day arrived, David Jr. and Monte had to open the track early. Though the races weren't scheduled to begin until 10am, hundreds of people showed up at the track just after 8 in the morning. Phoenix locals had organized their own buses to transport them in mass. 


At 9am Monte and the general manager shared an opening-day drink down on the track, which David Jr. declined.


The morning of July 10th, 1982 was a scorcher and the decision to allow people to drink for free quickly became an expensive one. Monte opened the bar early, at 10am and by 10:30 the line for the bar wrapped twice around the lobby.


David Jr., Charlotte and another barman opened two more makeshift  bars  - one next to the outside grandstands and one on the other side of the lobby - to deal with the demand. 


Every seat in the inside grandstand was taken and people fought for the outside seats as well. Around 150 people stood mingling around the lobby, watching the races from above and sticking close to the bar. They won money, they lost it, they laughed and cried and drank. By noon, the party was in full swing and everyone was in a boisterous and rollicking good mood.


The first sign something was wrong was around 11:45am when the lines for the bathrooms grew as long as the lines for the bar. 


At around 12:20pm people in the lobby started to get sick. Only a handful at first. but within an hour people were vomiting where they stood - this quickly spread to the grandstands. 


The general manager of the track, who was stuck behind the reservations desk, informed concerned patrons that it was simply a bad batch of liquor and that it would pass. When several people in the lobby began to seizure, David Jr. closed the betting counter to stop people from asking for their money back.


By 1:30pm, the first person was dead. 


He was followed in quick succession by others - death spread like wildfire. Some were found to have dropped dead in the bathrooms, others simply never raised themselves out of their seats and died where they sat and yet others keeled over in the lobby, screaming in pain.  


Local emergency services, who had finally been called after the first death, were slow to respond and by 4:30pm 618 people were dead and a thousand more were hospitalized. Tents were set up in the dirt parking lot and medical staff were called in from every town within a 200 mile radius. Of those that were hospitalized, another 381 people died just outside the dog track. The 999 deaths were ruled as poisonings. 


David Jr., Charlotte and Monte all survived. 


David Jr., the first to cast an accusation, wrote a letter to his father the following day which included a timeline of events on the day of the murders and a paragraph detailing why he couldn't help but be suspicious of his sister. Charlotte had appeared unfazed as so many people died violent deaths next to her bar, and had also gone to considerable lengths to ensure that the man called Brad Davidson was served several free drinks. 


Charlotte, in turn, openly accused her husband of the murders, after every bottle of liquor in the building tested positive for Arsenic. She stated that on that day she had twice raised a glass of bourbon to her lips, only to have Monte slap it away. Peculiar, she mused, that he had suddenly become so concerned for her pregnancy when he  never had before. Monte disagreed that this ever occurred.


David Jr., a seasoned drinker, was also suspected of the murders due to his refusal of an opening day drink with his manager, a tradition that David Jr. had always taken part in. In fact, no one had ever seen David Jr. turn down a drink in his life. 


Monte, for his part,  quietly accused Western Racing Inc., as he had started to receive threats from the east coast company the week before. 


David Sr. wrote in correspondence to a business partner later that year that *he* believed the towns religious zealots had organized the poisonings since they were the only ones to gain from it.
	

The governor of Arizona at the time ordered a hasty investigation and a purging of all mentions of the tragedy from the local media, thereby ensuring it wouldn't get picked up nationally. 

Most of the families of the victims (those gamblers who even had families) were purportedly bought off and the FBI closed the investigation on July 16th. The governor was in the throes of his own scandal at the time (accusations of handing out Indian casino licenses in return for campaign donations) and didn't want  more bad press for his state.


In the end, no charges were filed. The track was closed that day and abandoned until the mid-80's when Albert Funk tried to revive the property as a swap meet venue.  He abandoned this venture two years later after it failed to draw vendors.


David Jr. and his brother-in-law Monte gave up race tracks and opened a successful string of portrait studios throughout the southwest. David Jr died in 2005 and Monte in 2007. Charlotte and Richard are the only Funk children still alive today. No one has ever admitted to the murders.
	

Perhaps one of the more confusing aspects of this case is the fact that Black Canyon City's well water was also found to be contaminated with high levels of arsenic in 1985. Today, residents of the town and local businesses are served by a private water company due to the toxicity of their ground water.


Sadly, the culprit in this case may never be known due both to the local authorities refusal to investigate the massacre and the federal government's disinterest in it. And even if someone did decide to reopen the 30 year old cold case, most of the evidence has probably decayed and been destroyed by time.


Of course, as you know, Black Canyon City Dog Track still stands today and you can even visit the bar where almost 1,000 people met their deaths.  If you do decide to visit, take your time walking the grounds. You may even stumble on betting tickets with the date "July 10th, 1982" printed on them, as I did the last time I was there.


Even the bar still stands, though it is hidden beneath a pile of detritus. If you do manage to dig it out you may even find an unopened bottle of gin.  But I wont tell you not to drink it. Ive always thought 999 was an unsatisfactory number.

Cards Against Humanity TableTop Expansion pack!

Are you a horrible person? Details on The Cards Against Humanity expansion pack are finally here!  Here is the lowdown, straight from the man Himself!

"Max here, one of the co-creators of Cards Against Humanity.

Cards Against Humanity is a party game for horrible people. It's pretty simple to play: Someone asks a question or fill-in-the-blank phrase from a black card, and then everyone answers with the funniest white card in their hand. Then you just do that over and over until someone flips the table over.

We're big fans of Tabletop, and we want to do our part to help make a new season, so we've agreed to work with them on a limited-edition pack of Cards Against Humanity cards, just for the backers of Tabletop Season Three.

Over the next few months, we'll work with Wil to write 15-card pack of Cards Against Humanity cards, and everyone who backs this project for over $20 will get that pack as a free bonus reward. This pack won't be part of a stretch goal or any other nonsense, it's just our way of saying thank you for supporting one of our favorite things on the internet, and helping some of our favorite people make something amazing.

Thanks for your support, we're really excited to make something cool with you!" 




 It sounds like this is very possible.

 Back up off that ledge, friend! As of this morning:

 I'm not a fan of trigger warnings, myself. I actually didn't use them until someone (not a mod) strongly suggested one and then I added it to one of my stories. My stories usually have twists and a trigger warning is hard to add without spoiling it. 

It would be nice if the flair just said "Trigger Warning" and then, if you wanted to see it, you could hover over the flair and it would tell you what kind of trigger was tagged.


 




 I think this is relevant but I only write horror on /nosleep. I've been working on a sci-fi/fantasy novel for about 10 months and I'm so absorbed that I eat and sleep in it. Sometimes I write a nosleep story just to "cleanse the palette", so to speak. It's surreal.  




 Have you gone home yet? 




 True, I've never heard of a Norwegian ship that big. 

Update, OP?  




 ^ the exception to the rule?  




 For about a week last year, TVs in my house would randomly turn on. And like, not just the TVs, but the surround sound too. 

It only happened at night and it happened in all 3 bedrooms in my house and the living room. But never at the same time.

It was seriously unsettling.  




 Well that is just NOT true. We cruise a lot and I've been on a couple "re-positioning" cruises, the latest one was LA to Sydney, Australia. And that was on Carnival.

 The scene in Titanic when the steerage passengers and their children are trapped by a gate and the crewman wont open it to let them out. And then later one of the steerage passengers, a young mother resigned to her fate, lays her children down in bed and reads them a story as the ship sinks.

Points for sad historical accurateness.  




 This is extremely relevant to me right now, as I am on the cusp of quitting my job to pursue my passion. Somebody please answer. 




 I'm almost certain you can.

Shall we try to summon /u/wil? 




 Yeah, sorry then I don't know, either! 




 Ok yeah, so going by the 7 months, definitely not an animal.

But I mean if you want to kill thousands of people never to be found, condemning them to the bottom of the ocean is effective. 

As for the actual ships, all I can think is like "here's your personal invitation and ticket to the maiden voyage of _____!" which may or may not actually be carnival/princess/Disney ships.  




 Actually no. I didn't think there was a minimum though. I'll have to look. 




 I think it was in one of the updates and he also talked about it during his google hangout. 

Here are a couple articles referencing it:

 The [Tabletop Indiegogo campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tabletop-season-3-with-wil-wheaton) has mentioned giving out special official  CAH packs to backers if they reach $900,000 (which we did). Could be something related to that?

These cruise ships are sinking every 7 months. That slots the next one for August of this year.

OP, the way I see it, you have two choices. You can either delete this post and shut up about it completely or spread it around everywhere until you are the least of their problems.

I'm curious of this is government or something else out there in the ocean.

 Congratulations on your appointment! 

Also, I'm enjoying all the Ten in this thread.  




 Whatever she was buried in (I forget the name of the material) basically mummified her. As to how they discovered and collected this evidence, I don't even want to know. I assume my father purposefully set out to preserve her body so that one day the truth would come to light and he would be more or less exonerated (in every way but legally).  




 I haven't seen the tox screens, I was only told that she was "drugged". I'm not sure what they found.  




 Thanks! I really need to do a Return to Deepwood, PA story.  




 ***Possible Triggers - (please see end of post)***
________________________________________________________

It's funny what you remember as a kid. I don't remember my 5th birthday or my first day of school. But I remember very clearly the day my dog died. It's been 12 years now, and it's still the most vivid memory of my childhood. 

My sister Ashley and I were typical twins. Always hatching diabolical plans and getting into trouble together. On this particular day, we had colored our cat, Pongo, blue. Even though my mom tried to punish us separately - me on the stairs, Ashley in the dining room - we were still making faces at each other and giggling. She was just about to scold us when the doorbell rang.

My mother gave us both a you-better-not-move-a-muscle look as she went to answer the door. 

Standing on our stoop was a tall, lanky blonde man wearing a red tracksuit. I remember he had shifting, watery eyes. He noticed Ashley and I immediately.

What *we* noticed was that he was holding our dog, Rocky under one arm like a sack of flour. Ashley called to Rocky softly, but the dog didn't move. The man began to talk lowly with my mother. She cupped a hand over her mouth and I heard him say "Do you mind if I use your hose?"

My mother rushed us upstairs to our room and we watched out the window as the man rinsed off his fender in front of our house. It was our first taste of death and we cried for two days. We were six.

My parents, deciding to use the sad occasion as an opportunity to teach us about death, held a funeral in our backyard for Rocky. Ashley and I cried as we read a poem we had written together the night before.

My mother held us as my father hammered a white, wooden cross into the ground bearing Rocky's name. Even our older brother Eric was there, which  was nice because he was almost always next door playing video games and smoking something smelly with the neighbor kids. I think I saw him tear up a little. We had loved Rocky.

That was only two months before it happened. 

What I remember much less clearly was the night that Ashley disappeared. 

My parents had thrown a going away party for Eric, who was leaving for a semester abroad in Japan. Ashley and I had begged them to make it a pool party and we'd finally worn them down after much pestering. The pool had only gone in three months before and it was our official christening party!

Oddly, I remember only bits and pieces of that night. My father was drunk. My mother was giving tours of our newly remodeled house to everyone, whether they wanted to see it or not. My brother was in the living room with his friends playing video games. And Ashley and I were in the pool playing mermaids, which was our favorite game. 

My uncle Cliff gave us rubber bands which we used to bind our ankles together. We then swam around the pool pretending to be mermaid princesses. Just after it got dark my mom called us for dinner.  We both jumped out of the pool and ran around the edge before my father yelled at us.

"Rachel! Ashley! No running, or you're going inside for the night!"

My mother handed us our burgers and people cooed and admired our matching bathing suits. We were always matching. Together we sat down on the pool deck to eat.  Afterward, we got back in the water to play mermaids, again. 

At some point my mother called us in to bed. We pretended to cry and begged her to let us stay up a little later. She didn't fall for it. We stomped up the stairs and went into the bathroom to strip out of our swim suits. I remember we decided to switch beds and dress in each others pajamas so we could play a trick on Mommy in the morning. It was our favorite prank and she deserved it for making us go to bed early when we weren't tired. Nevertheless, we fell asleep quickly. 

The next morning, I woke up alone. I don't remember getting dressed or eating breakfast. What I do remember is spending what felt like forever walking around our house looking for Ashley. The new renovations had yielded new hiding spots and it took me awhile to check them all.

I finally went to ask my mom, who asked my dad, who had just returned from dropping Eric at the airport. 

"Paul, please tell me you took Ashley with you to drop Eric off?!"

"No, why?" My dad's face paled instantly.

"Oh my God. Paul, we've looked everywhere, we can't find her."

My dad was already moving from room to room in the house checking all the places I had checked. By the time he returned, my dad was crying. 

"Diane, call the police. Now."

That was the day my mother turned into something else. She never smiled or cried again. 

But I did. 

But I never cried as much as I did when when Rocky died, which always made me feel bad and confused.

I remember a big police man talking to me, asking me what I remembered, had I heard anything in the middle of the night. He even asked if I liked having an identical twin sister or if I hated it. That question confused me for many years. 

The days turned to a week and still no Ashley. I slept alone in my room, switching from bed to bed, some nights pretending I was Ashley and it was Rachel who was missing. 

Lots of men with dogs came and went into the woods behind our house. Reporters were parked outside everyday and overnight. My parents wouldn't let me watch TV. The policemen tore up my bedroom and the rest of the house. I thought they were looking for a goodbye note. I thought Ashley had run away. I was so mad at her. 

Months went by and I grew lonely. I was excited when my birthday came. My mom cried from morning to night that day so my dad took me out for pizza. But he was quiet the entire time. My brother fell in love with a local and decided to stay in Japan. Since he was 18, my dad couldn't stop him. My mother missed him and Ashley and drank wine and slept all the time. My father tried to be there to support me but he was suffering in his own way, I think. He upgraded Rocky's wooden cross to proper stone when I asked why Ashley hadn't had a funeral.  I think he knew I needed a place to grieve. We all did.

One day he came home with a new dog which I named Naughty Boy. I hated Naughty Boy. He was trying to be Rocky and no dog could *ever* be Rocky. He eventually ran away. No one looked for him.

Four months after Ashley disappeared my father filled in the pool. I remember sitting in my room (which felt big and cavernous and cold) and watching them drain the pool. It took two days to fill it in with dirt. The pool had been the one last happy thing in my life. And my father had taken it away. He had taken my brother away too. He was the taker of things. 

One afternoon, I was flipping through channels on the TV. The remote dropped from my hands when I suddenly saw my face on screen. It was a show called Unsolved Mysteries. My mother walked in then and saw what I was watching. I was afraid I was in trouble but she just gave me a blank look and walked right back out. I turned the TV off.

My parents began to yell at each other when they thought I couldn't hear. Their marriage was strained. There were so many phone calls from witnesses who reported seeing Ashley somewhere. But they were almost always just seeing me. Whenever this turned out to be the case, which was often, my mother would give me an accusing look, like I had purposefully raised her hopes and then kicked the chair out from under her. Every false lead seemed to kill her a little more.

It was around then that I realized why no one liked me anymore. I was like a ghost, an echo of my sister. A pale shadow following around her mysterious disappearance. My parents could barely look at me. I know they  think I didn't notice, but I did.

We eventually had a funeral for Ashley, but I don't remember it very well. At least, not as well as Rocky's funeral. I just recall thinking how stupid it was to have a funeral for an empty box. 

After a year, my mother filed for divorce. I still remember their very last fight. They were so far gone by then that they didn't seem to care that I heard.

"My brother would never hurt my children. Christ, what the hell is wrong with you, Diane? You can't just go around casually accusing people of serious crimes like kidnapping!"

"She's not kidnapped anymore, *Paul*, is she?" She spat at him. "She's dead! But I'm starting to think you already know that."

"How *dare* you say something like that to me. I love Ashley. I loved all our children!"

"Yeah, I'm sure you loved Ashley a lot. How much *did* you love her, Paul? Do I need to keep Rachel away from you, too?"

*SLAP*

I recoiled like it had been me he'd hit. I didn't understand what my mother had said. Tears poured down my face. Stupid Ashley. Why couldn't she have just stayed in bed? Why did she have to go wandering off? Where did she go? Why had she done this to our family?

My thoughts were interrupted by a whisper from the next room.

"Why did you fill in the pool, Paul?"

I ran then. I didn't understand that question. I didn't want to understand. 

Years went by. My mother met a new man named Bobby and moved out of our house.  My dad and I maintained a strained but quiet home life - I avoided him at all costs. I spent more and more time at friend's houses and he spent more and more time in his study. The following summer, Dad built a deck over our filled-in pool. He never bought furniture for it.

When I was 13 I learned that my mom was living with Uncle Cliff, my dad's brother. I hated going to their house. Cliff had an above ground pool, and always tried to get me to go swimming with him. He even bought me swim suits, little bikinis that made me uncomfortable to look at. They would be laid out on the bed whenever I came to visit. 

But I never went swimming with Uncle Cliff. I hated pools now. Soon they stopped inviting me to their house. 

My dad was now spending every night shut up in his study, which he had moved to the room at the back of the house. He kept it locked and he would never let me inside. 

I moved out when I was 18. My dad hugged me the day I left. It was the first time he had looked at me, much less touched me in seven years. He whispered that he loved me and then turned around and walked back into his study, closing the door behind him and locking it. I left. 

Three weeks later a police officer showed up at my apartment. He sat me down and told me my father had been found dead.

I went to the house that night. My dad had killed himself in his study while sitting at his desk. I finally got to see the room - the body was gone, but the blood remained.

I looked around. The study was basically empty. There was a desk, a chair, seven photos, a notebook and a drawing.  The desk sat in the middle of the room and faced the window to the backyard. The photos were of Ashley and I. The drawing was one that Ashley had drawn of our family shortly before she disappeared. The notebook was empty except for the last page. 

It said: *What happened the night of August 16th, 2002*

But there was nothing written below it.

The chair was covered in blood but I was so numb I sat in it anyway. So it had been him. The whispers were true, he had been him all along. Our own father. 

"What have you done?" I whispered.

 I looked out the window and was surprised to find it situated over Rocky's grave. The tombstone was almost close enough the read.

"Ma'am? Ma'am, I know this is difficult. But I- I want to let you know that with this notebook we can get a warrant to excavate the yard."

I glanced up at the detective standing next to me. I knew he was trying to tread lightly. I nodded at him.

"But out of respect," he continued, "I want to ask you first."

I looked back out into the yard. I looked at the empty deck my father had spent an entire summer building and then never used. What was buried underneath it? I stood up and looked the detective dead in the eye.

"Dig it up."

I thought I knew what they'd find at this point. I thought maybe my mother had known it all along. But neither of us were right.

The excavation took 6 days. First, they had to tear up the deck. I stayed at the house that week, in my old room, and watched their progress from my bedroom window. The room didn't feel too big anymore. It felt small and suffocating.

I had my father quickly cremated and scattered his ashes in a ditch off the 405. I threw the urn in there too. 

The first body was found at 11:29pm on a Thursday. I awoke to the sounds of yelling and dressed quickly. I ran down the stairs, through the door and out under the flood lights in the backyard. I darted my way around the mounds of dirt to where the forensics team was gathered. I braced myself and peered over their shoulders.

"That's not my sister."

They all turned to look at me. 

"What is she doing here?" Someone said so no one in particular.

"That's not Ashley." I tried again. Someone grabbed my arm then.

"Who is that? That's not my sister! Who is that?" I was yelling. I knew I was becoming hysterical, but I couldn't stop myself from screaming. 

They dragged me away from the body. I sat next to the house wrapped in a blanket for the rest of the night. I didn't understand. Who was that? That wasn't Ashley. Ashley was me and that wasn't me. The bones were too big. They were too long. That wasn't Ashley. Who was that?

At dawn, someone finally came to talk to me. 

"Rachel-"

"Who is that?" I asked for the hundredth time that night.

"Rachel, we can't say for certain at this point but there's some strong evidence to suggest that the body might be, well that it could be...your brother."

"No," I said flatly, shaking my head. "Eric is in Japan. He's married. He's 30 now."

"Well, do you have an address? Or a phone number?"

"No... I mean...Eric doesn't talk to anybody anymore."

"Okay, well the M.E. took the body, so we'll know more soon. Just hang tight." 

*Just hang tight.* What an absurd thing to say. The shitty world I had managed to build for myself from the ashes of my former life was starting to crumble.

Who was in the pool? The question haunted me for days. It wasn't Eric, it couldn't be. That much I knew. Unless Eric had come back from Japan. But I would know if he had, wouldn't I? Wouldn't he have come to see me?

I got my answers a few days later. Eric had not come back from Japan - because Eric had never left. Though his body had almost completely decomposed, the cheap, plastic "Good Luck" beaded necklace around his neck hadn't. The police ruled that he had died on the night of the party.

I didn't understand anything anymore. My mind refused to accept their findings. I began falling apart. 

I wasn't there when they found the other body in the pool. It was Rocky's. When I walked into the house, they gave me his bones in an evidence box. It was all they had. 

I looked down at the box and the dirty bones inside, and I knew where Ashley was. I knew why my father had moved his office. I knew why he had replaced Rocky's cheap wooden headstone with a heavy one made of shiny white marble. I knew why he had inscribed it: *A Voice I Loved is Still*. I knew why the date didn't match Rocky's death. 

Ashley's small body was well preserved. When I saw how little she was, I started shaking. I never remembered being so small. He had taken great care in burying her. She was inside a white bag I had never seen before, a special type I had never heard of. It had effectively mummified her. She was laying on her back in a dress with her small hands crossed and her eyes closed. She looked peaceful and beautiful.

I watched them place her gently on a metal board. I watched them zip a different bag over her. I watched them load her into a van. And I watched them take her away. I sat down next to the headstone. It was her resting place for the the last 12 years. I looked through the window and I saw my dad's desk and his chair. I sat there all night. People brought me water and tea. But I just stared at the empty hole in the ground. Confused, angry and lost. 

The excavation team left the next morning. The lead detective on Ashley's case - a man named Beller - called me around dawn. Because of the state of Ashley's body, they were able to collect evidence from her. They were waiting for it to cycle through the lab. I asked what kind of evidence. He wouldn't say.

The day I got the official report is another that I will never forget.  

I was on the phone with my mother who I had finally found after months searching. She was in Philadelphia with Uncle Cliff and they had taken up heroin together. 

I told her the police wanted to talk to her. I told her about Ashley and Dad. I didn't tell her about Eric yet. I couldn't tell her that over the phone.

But she wasn't all there. She asked the same questions again and again. She repeated what I said. It was hopeless. I took down her number and hung up the phone. Detective Beller could deal with her. 

As soon as I hung up, he called me.

"Rachel, we have the results of the autopsies, can you come down to the station?"

I sighed. It was late. After the conversation with my mother I was exhausted and emotionally drained. There was no way I would make it downtown tonight. 

"Can you just tell me over the phone? I'm sorry, I can't, there's no way I can get there tonight."

"Where are you? I'll send a car."

"Actually, can you please just tell me. I can't...I can't go back there. I can't see their bodies again. I can't be in that room."

The detective paused then seemed to come to a decision.

"Rachel, there was semen on Ashley's body."

"What?" I didn't hear that right.. 

"Yeah... We also found ligature marks on her neck. The Medical Examiner has ruled Ashley's death a homicide."

"Yeah, okay, but-"

"There is no mistake."

"Yeah, but, can you say the first part again? Because I swear you said-"

"Rachel, your sister was raped."

*No, no, no, no, no.*

"My dad couldn't have-"

"The semen isn't a match to your dad. It's a match to your brother."

I didn't speak. I didn't move. Until I started to shake.

"I wouldn't usually be so frank, but you've been through a lot and you deserve to know this. Here is what we have pieced together: on the night of August 16th, 2002 Eric went into your room and took Ashley. He then drugged her, raped her and, accidentally we think, killed her by strangulation. Your father walked in on him and beat your brother to death. This all occurred in the late evening or early morning of the party. He then held the bodies for a month or so until he had the pool filled."

"My-my brother went to Japan-"

"No, he didn't."

"But my dad, he killed them-"

"No, he killed one of them. This is a crime of passion and, honestly, I'm not even sure your dad would have done time for it. I don't understand why he didn't just come forward."

I was silent. I knew why. Because of me and my mom. Ashley's disappearance had broken us but we'd always had hope. Hope that Ashley would be released someday. Hope that she had found a new family. Hope that she would eventually come home. But she had never left.

And Eric, how could we reconcile our beloved Eric with the monster he truly was? My father had borne this knowledge and the burdens of it alone. His sacrifice may have been wasted on my mother but not on me. That hope for Ashley, and love for Eric and my parents had gotten me through so much when there was so little ground to stand on. The cost he must have paid to do this for me - it was unfathomable.

And I had burned his body and scattered his ashes on a highway. He would never be laid to rest with the family he had endured so much to protect. And I had done this to him.

My father wasn't the monster. I was. 

I filled a casket with the photos on my father's desk and the drawing he had held to his chest when he shot himself. And then I, too, buried an empty casket. I buried Ashley next to my dad, and my mother on her other side two years later. I don't know what the state did with Eric's body and I haven't asked. 

So really, this is a letter to you, Ashley. To let you know why this happened and to tell you I'm sorry.  

I'm sorry that when the monster came that night he choose you instead of me. 

I'm sorry that I thought you ran away, and I'm sorry I never looked for you.

I'm sorry I abandoned the person who loved you the most  to his demons.  I'm sorry I left him forgotten and alone in a ditch. 

I'm sorry I blamed you for destroying our family.

But most of all, I'm sorry that I'm the only one left standing.

 I grew up in Keeling, Missouri. No, you wouldn't have heard of it. It was a small, rural, upper-middle class community where everyone owned at least an acre or two. My father was a writer and my mother wanted to keep horses so this was the perfect little "one-stoplight town" to settle in. 

I grew up there until suddenly, in 1984, the government claimed eminent domain on all of Keeling and we were bought out. My dad moved us to sunny California.

I'm a writer, too, though I'm not as well known as my father. I write informational pieces for online magazines and blogs. As you can probably guess, I'm barely getting by. So when one of my editors asked me to write an article on eminent domain for a well known political website, I jumped at the chance. She told me I was chosen because I had first-hand experience with eminent domain and the buyer wanted a personal piece that included photos. 

I packed my bags that night, excited for the project. I'd always been curious about what became of my hometown, anyway. Before he died, my dad told me he thought Keeling had been turned into an airport.

First - research. I was disappointed to find the internet all but mute on the old town - citing my sources was going to be difficult. I knew Keeling had been near Poplar Bluff, Missouri so I pulled up Google Earth and followed the 67 north to the turn off for Keeling. 

Odd. The entire town was...blank. Not blank like there weren't any buildings, blank like there was a gaping black hole where Keeling used to be - a hole in the satellite data. It could only mean one thing. I slammed my laptop shut and through the mouse against the wall. It was private - and likely secret - government land now.

I hemmed and hawed on it a few days before deciding to go anyway. This particular buyer had allotted me a per diem (funds) for travel and I might as well use them. Maybe there was still a story here.

Two days later I was driving through Poplar Bluff in a rented Ford Focus. I stopped at a gas station for some water and granola bars, deciding to check into the hotel after I got back from Keeling. I was looking forward to seeing it again. 

I took the exit north on the 67 and drove until I realized I'd missed the turn off. I circled back, looking for anything familiar. I drove back and forth until I found it. Barely there, covered in plant life and completely unrecognizable, was a road. I'd seen this street a million times, but never unpaved which is why I'd missed it. Someone had pulled up the asphalt and the road was completely overgrown. Bizarre.

I drove the six miles into Keeling wishing I had rented something with bigger tires and a higher clearance. Suddenly, the pavement returned and I rolled into the abandoned business district of Keeling. It was small - a post office, a gas station and a bar. All the buildings were derelict and rotting - their decay far more consistent with something left sitting for 100 years - not 30. 

I drove through the eerily quiet town with the burned out stoplight and continued down route 51 toward my old house. 

As I passed the other houses on the street, I noticed they were in the same state of advanced decay as those in town. It was unsettling, pulling up to the house I'd lived in only 30 years before to find it crumbling and consumed by time. 

I went through every room in my house for the nostalgia, but found nothing of interest. We had packed well - there was nothing left here but a mannequin covered by a beige sheet in my mom's old sewing room. I was glad she left that, those things were creepy. 

I left my old house and continued down the road, which by now had turned back to dirt. Just why had the government bought this place? Why spend all that money, buy up all this land and then abandon it? My stomach fell as I started to realize there may be no story here. I was going to return to LA empty handed. I swore audibly. 

I counted house after house knowing I was reaching the end of the street. All were in varied states of decomposition, some had even collapsed in on themselves. 

The house at the end of the drive began coming in to view. I slowed down to take it in as it filled my windshield. I never remembered this house being this big, but then, my parents hadn't let me go this far down the street.  

While every other building in Keeling was disintegrating rapidly, this house stood proud and palatial, untouched by the decades. It was almost as if this place was stealing the energy, life even, of every other building in town. And maybe even more than that...

A large, very clear and defined area of dead grass circled the house. Two dead trees stood skeletized within this radius. Toxic ground water, perhaps? The windows were all barred, save a small, circular port window on the third story. If the government had claimed this town for anything, it was clearly this house, it was so different from the others. But what was so special about it?

Smelling a story at last, I parked in the pristine white driveway and climbed out of my car, hauling my camera and laptop cases over my shoulder. I walked up the four steps to the door and was delighted to find it unlocked.

The foyer was large and the house smelled musty. A staircase to the second floor was set right in front of me, a floor to ceiling mirror on the wall to my left and a closed door and hallway beyond it on my right. I set my stuff down and took my phone out - no signal. Faaaaantastic. Looks like I wouldn't be calling the hotel about my late arrival.

I toured the house, snapping a few pictures with my cell as I went. The first floor had a library, a living room, a kitchen and a dining room. All the furniture had been left, even the dining room table was set, and everything was orderly and oddly dust free. Was someone still cleaning this place?

The second floor had 4 bedrooms and another narrow staircase that led up to the attic. I tried the attic door first, but found it to be locked. The first room I went into was the master bedroom. It was simple yet cozy and had an adjoining bathroom. I eyed the bed with interest, a sudden idea coming to me. I may not have to leave Keeling tonight after all.

The next room from the master stood with door ajar. This room was bare except for nine mannequins, all covered in musty, yellowed sheets like the one at my house. I snapped a quick picture and shuddered, closing the door to the room. 

The next door in the hallway was closed. I opened it and stumbled back in surprise. This room had a child's bed and was filled wall to wall with dolls. 

I circled the room, curiously picking up a few. Baby Alive dolls, Cabbage patch dolls, and tons of creepy, little, yellowing porcelain dolls. They all appeared to be looking at the bed. I snapped two pictures in this room vowing to come back with my Canon.  

I closed this door too and entered the last room on the second floor. It was a simple office - green carpet and green wallpaper. It had a plain desk and tan typewriter with a new white - not yellowed - piece of paper loaded into it. Interesting. 

I left this room and descended the stairs. It was time to bring out the big guns. I bent down to unsheathe my Canon when movement caught my eye to my right. I turned and looked into the mirror. I'd known it was there subconsciously so what had caught my attention? I reached for my camera again and realized what was wrong.

The mirror, more specifically my movements in it, were somehow how of sync. When I moved my arm, my reflection did so about a quarter second later. When I blinked, my eyes were still closed in the mirror when I opened them again. It was incredibly unsettling.

I continued to watch my delayed reflection when I suddenly heard a noise, like the creaking of a stair. But it didn't come from the staircase on the right, it came from directly behind me, behind the basement door. Someone was coming up the stairs of the basement. So there was someone here! I eagerly gripped the basement door and tried to open it but - like the attic - it was locked. I banged on the door but heard only silence below. Ah - animals. Of course. 

Still determined to find a story I opened the front door to unload my car and stopped short. What the.... My car, which I had definitely parked at the top of the driveway, was now parked at the bottom of the driveway, almost in the street. I had parked it at the top of the driveway, hadn't I? I'd just been so excited...I couldn't remember.

I unloaded the car and brought my stuff up to the master bedroom. As I walked by the sewing room I noticed the door stood open again - but I knew I had closed it. I went to peer in and this time, there were at least 14 sheeted mannequins in it. There had been 9 last time. Right? I had counted. This time there were 5 more. Something was definitely going on. Perhaps it was all in my head. Maybe the air was toxic somehow, and that's why the government pushed everyone out of Keeling. Was I losing it? I took another photo.

By the time I had deposited everything in the master bedroom, I was winded. I felt so weak, I had to lay down on the bed. This was unusual for me - someone who had nothing better to do most days than go to the gym. 

I must have fallen asleep because the next thing I knew I heard someone with a high, small voice say, "Say bye-bye!"

I bolted upright and looked around in a panic, eventually noticing one of the dolls from the little girl's room sitting on the bedside table. It was small and porcelain. Since when did they make talking porcelain dolls? 

I rubbed my eyes and glanced around the room. In the muted light of the setting sun I saw someone in the corner. Not someone...something. It was one of those stupid sheet-covered mannequins. I shuddered - that definitely wasn't there before. 

I walked over to it. Someone was fucking with me, I knew it. I started to raise the sheet to see underneath when I heard a loud bang from downstairs. I let the sheet drop and started toward the bedroom door when I suddenly felt very sick. I dashed into the bathroom and threw up in the toilet. What was wrong with me? I wasn't going to have a lot of time here - whatever was going on in this place, it was making me ill.

I stood up from the toilet and splashed water on my face. This time when I looked into the bathroom mirror my reflection's movements were at least a half second behind mine. I waved my hands in front of the mirror horrified by my reflection's slow response. I watched the blood leave my face and gaped at my reflection in dismay. How was this even possible?

Of course, it wasn't. What was going on in the house was, dare I say it, supernatural? Possibly. I mean, what scientific explanations were there? I'd wanted a story and I'd gotten one. I could be the first journalist to prove the existence of...what? Ghosts? Demons? Poltergeists? I guess it didn't matter. It was my payday - and I was going to need evidence. 

As I turned away from the mirror to find my camera, I could have sworn I saw my reflection wink at me. I grabbed the Canon off the floor and began photographing everything I saw. I went downstairs to re-shoot every room, starting with the library. I started pulling books out one by one and quickly realized that every single book in the library was a copy of the Bible. Many different versions in many different languages. I opened a few that were in English and found that the word 'God' was scratched out on every page, in every one. 

It was getting dark and just as I thought about seeing if the lighting worked in this house, a light flicked on in the dining room pouring out into the hallway. What the...

I turned my camera to photograph the corridor when I suddenly heard heavy stomping. It was more than stomping, it was almost running - and it was coming down the hallway right towards me. I dropped the camera and stood frozen with fear. 

Whatever it was entered the library and stomped right up in front of me. I couldn't see anything, but there was definitely something there - I could feel it blocking me from leaving. I slowly pulled my phone out of my pocket and took a picture of whatever was right in front of my face. The flash momentarily blinded me and when I recovered my vision, all the books in the library were on the floor, as if they had been ripped from the shelves in a rage, and in only that few seconds of silence. But I felt that whatever had been standing in front of me was gone.

I picked up the Canon, took a few more pictures with shaking hands, and tiptoed my way out of the room. I realized I needed video - not pictures. I pulled my cell phone out again and opened it up to video then walked down the hallway toward the lit dining room. I passed a painting in the hallway and caught sight of my smirking reflection. But I wasn't smiling. 

As soon as I entered the dining room, I noticed something was different. A noose made of stained sheets was now tied to a beam above the table. It was swinging back and forth as if it were weighted, but nothing else in the room was moving. Even the beamed creaked as it swung, as if it, too, was straining from the weight of something. I filmed it for a minute and then raised the Canon for a picture. It suddenly stopped swinging as if someone had grabbed it midair. I heard giggling from upstairs. 

I left the dining room and walked toward the staircase, warily. Did I really want to go up there? I didn't hear the giggling anymore but I heard the typewriter clicking away. I happened to glance toward the large foyer mirror again to see it was now out of sync a full second behind me. I heard the giggling again and then something small run down the hallway and slam a bedroom door. On gut reaction alone, I threw the door open, intending to flee. 

The car was now 50 yards down the street. I was about to bolt for it anyway when I heard another stair creek behind me - through the basement door. This time, it was closer, further up the stairs. Maybe only 5 steps below the main floor. I shook my head as if to shake it clear of fear. Every journalist dreams of a chance like this, of a story like this. I had to stay just long enough to get something on video.

I heard the typewriter start to click again and sprinted up the stairs, running full speed into the office. The typewriter had stopped typing by the time I got there and I ran over to see what it had written. I sat down at the desk when I reached it, suddenly feeling tired and weak again. 

The paper read: "jamie ellis is condemned. jamie ellis is condemned. jamie ellis is condemned." over and over again, all the way down the page. I took a photo with the Canon and waited to see if it would start typing. Just then, I heard the giggling echo down the hallway again. I rose from the chair and left the office, stepping out into the darkening hallway.

The child's bedroom door was closed but I could hear scuffling and movement from behind it. I slowly opened the door hoping I would find animals. Cats, raccoons, mice, anything! But it wasn't animals.

Every doll in the room was where I'd left it. Only now all their heads were turned toward the door. They were looking at me...

I heard another giggle on my right and noticed movement out of the corner of my eye. I quickly slammed the door shut and fell back against the banister in terror. I couldn't do this. I slowly got up, tired and shaky. I walked by the sewing room door, open again, and this time there were only 3 mannequins left in the room. 

I didn't stop to wonder where the others had gone. I bolted down the stairs as something else ran up, stomping the entire way.

I had been wrong. So wrong. It was time to leave, I needed to get out. I turned the front door handle and was sickened to feel it locked. I ran down the hall, through the living room, and into the kitchen, pulling on the backdoor and screaming in frustration when it wouldn't open. 

"Where ya goin? He he he." I heard from the living room. The dolls. Jesus, the dolls. I stumbled into the living room which was now lit by a single tall, black lamp in the corner. There was a doll on the floor in the middle of the room that hadn't been there before. 

Knowing my fate was probably already sealed, I walked over and picked her up off the floor. Her head hung limp behind her as any dolls' would.

"What did you say to me?" I breathed.

Nothing.

"What the fuck did you say to me?!" I demanded in a crazy panic.

The doll slowly picked it's head up and smiled, breaking the stitching on it's mouth. 

"You're never leaving, Jamie. You're going to be just like me soon."

I screamed and threw the doll against the wall. The lamp went out then and I heard the doll run off into the darkness.

I put my head between my knees breathing hard now. I couldn't catch my breath. This house was draining me, it was sucking the life from me, just like the rest of the town. I was so tired. 

I walked out into the hallway to make my way to the foyer again to try the door. I dropped to my knees in agonizing fear when I saw a sheeted mannequin standing in the middle of the hallway, 15 feet away. 

Tears poured down my face as I noticed for the first time that this mannequin had legs - and feet. Another doll. It was another doll. A human sized doll. They were all dolls...

Not knowing what else to do, I got to my feet and slowly raised the shaking camera to my eye, peering through the viewfinder. I snapped the picture and when I lowered the camera I screamed. It was now right in front of me, and it mumbling something unintelligible from under the sheet. 

I ran. I ran for my life, down the hall and this time, I had no reflection in the mirror. I didn't even want to think about where my reflection had gone. As I took the stairs two at a time, I heard whatever was on the basement stairs take another step up - it had to be nearly at the top. 

I ran into the master bedroom, not daring to look into the sewing room on the way. I fell down onto the bed and shook with tears. I had such sever muscle weakness at this point, I could barely move. How was I going to escape this place? I raised my head to look out the window for my car. I finally saw it - in the darkness - at the end of the street. I fell back to the bed, weak and sickly and slowly slipped into unconsciousness.

When I awoke again, it was with a start. Something was weighing me down on the bed. I shot up and noticed I had been tucked under the covers and the entire quilt was covered in little dolls. They were so many of them, all sitting on top of the covers, trapping me there, looking my direction. But the worst was at the end of the bed. There, leaning toward me over the footboard, was a mannequin. But I now knew it wasn't a mannequin - it was a doll. 

I gasped as the sheet slowly started to slip off the mannequin and I fell out of bed onto the floor. I heard the dolls giggling as I clawed my way out of the room. I didn't know where else to go. With the windows barred, and the doors locked the only way out seemed to be the small port window in the attic. I dragged myself up the stairs, hoping I had enough energy to throw myself against the door to break it in.

I found it unlocked. I crawled into the attic and turned toward the window - my heart plummeting into my stomach. Oh, there was the port window, sure enough. But between it and I was a sea of dolls and mannequins. They all just stood there, facing each other. There were hundreds of them. I moaned in defeated anguish and in terrifying unison, every head slowly turned toward me. I recoiled in horror and fell down the attic stairs, hitting the second floor with a hard thud.

The typewriter was clicking away again, but I already knew what it was typing. I stood up, in utter pain, and shuffled down the stairs. There had to be another way out, I wouldn't die here, I couldn't. All I'd wanted was my big break, what had I done to deserve all this?!

When I got to the bottom of the staircase, I dubiously turned to face the mirror. It was half a second behind me, again. I studied it looking for some sign of weakness, something to tell me what was going on, I didn't know what else to do. Suddenly, I heard a loud knocking on the basement door behind me and jumped. Oh God...whatever "it" was, it had reached the top of the stairs. 

I spun toward the door in a panic and dropped to my knees in my weakened state. I happened to glance under my arm and saw that, unlike me, my reflection had remained standing and facing me. I spun back to the mirror but by the time I did, it was just a half second behind me again. I leaned forward toward the mirror watching it take a moment to follow. I even tried blinking, but this time when I opened my eyes, it's eyes were still open. My reflection suddenly sneered at me and slammed the glass with it's fist from the other side. The glass cracked like a spiderweb and I fell back in terror, through the basement door that suddenly stood open. 

I felt every jolt and bump and crack as I tumbled down the stairs and when I finally came to rest at the bottom, I was in complete darkness. I tried to raise my head, but promptly passed out. 

This time when I came to the room was well lit. I was lying on a concrete floor, on a dirty, tan sheet just like the dozen mannequins standing around me wore. Other than them, there was nothing else in the basement save a large portrait which hung on the wall. I got to my knees and stumbled over to it.

The portrait was actually a mirror, or rather, was painted to look like a mirror of the room - and it was convincing. In the middle of the mirror stood a tall, dark haired solemn woman in a maroon dress. She looked almost familiar to me... Maybe? Yes, it was her! Ms. Harmon, a widow I used to see in town as a kid. But why was she dressed like a 17th century noble?

I leaned closer to study her face. She had less wrinkles than I remembered as a kid, but had those same dark-brown, angry eyes. The portrait blinked. I fell backwards, into a mannequin which somehow managed not to fall. It had...regained it's own balance, somehow. Feet. I looked around the room. They all had feet. 

I turned back in horror to the painting to see the woman's face slowly curl into a smile. 

"Stay away from me!" I screamed at her and ran for the stairs. I pushed my way through the mannequins, feeling their hands grab at my shirt, trying to pull me back. 

I took the stairs three at a time and when I reached the top, I slammed the door behind me. My reflection was standing in the middle of the mirror, unmoving, watching me quiet ire. I knew I couldn't get out the front door - there was only one way out now. 

I dragged myself into the library and grabbed the first chair I stumbled over. Running back, I raised the chair to throw into the mirror. In the second pause it hung over my head, I heard feet, little pitter-patters and loud thunderous steps running up the basement stairs and down the staircase to my right. I could see them all coming out of the corner of my eye but dared not look. 

I threw the chair full force against the mirror as my reflection continued to sneer at me. It shattered and with my last ounce of strength I stumbled into the black abyss on the other side. I heard the dolls follow, but I ran and ran - for hours it seemed - until I finally tripped over something and fell.

I listened for footsteps. Silence.

Looking up, I saw I was in the woods next to the house. There was nothing behind me or around me, I had no idea where I'd just come from. I could see the house, it sat quiet and serene in front on me. But I knew better. 

Gaining my feet, I ran. I kept falling, almost succumbing to darkness, but I pulled myself back up. I kept moving down the road, desperate to find my car. When I finally saw it on the moonlit horizon, I pulled the keys from my pocket and all but fell into the drivers-side door. 

Not wasting a moment, I started the car and peeled off down the street. I drove as fast as I could out of Keeling, twice slamming on the brakes when I thought I saw a sheet-covered mannequin in my rear-view mirror.

I never returned to Keeling, or Missouri for that matter. At least, not physically... Even though my body escaped, I never did. I'm still there. Every time I sleep - or even close my eyes - I am back there, running from room to room. The dolls find new ways to surprise and terrify me every night. If I daydream, it is the same. I am only a hallow shell of who I was. My memories and my body is here but my mind, my soul is still in Keeling, trapped in that house. 

In case you're wondering, I had escaped with my Canon around my neck but the pictures were all empty, as black as the hole that was Keeling on Google Earth.

Sometimes even after I wake up in the night, I see a mannequin in the corner of my room. I know I'm in California, but I'm also in Keeling, in that house at the same time. I have been condemned to it and a part of me lives there. Whatever the house's fate, it is my fate as well. 

Every night in my dreams the dolls try to pull me back into that basement. So far, I have resisted, but I can't hide forever. Someday, they will drag me back into the black abyss. And what awaits me there, I do not know.

 Ahh - I figured it out and edited my comment. Thought I caught it. Sorry! Thanks for the flair!

Edit: And thanks so much for the gold!! 




 Happy modiversary! 




 I've done that, some one had posted a few of my stories on Tumblr where they got quite popular. Some people had asked questions but since I don't know how to use tumblr, I couldn't answer them.

To her credit - she did credit me!

So it happens. I suggest copying a sentence from your story and put quotes around it, then google.  




 Ah yes, thank you!

 His tail was much, much longer, yes. I could try and draw it but I'm a terrible artist and your own idea of what it looked like may be more interesting anyway. 




 That's the worst of it, really. If Metaraxes consumes an individual it's likely killing more than just that one person (their children etc). I suppose that's why time is more complex around him. 

You may have had one - Eyeglass's went for about $399 if I remember, but they last for like 100 hours. I always wanted a pair.

[Return to Deepwood, Pennsylvania](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/29htgx/return_to_deepwood_pennsylvania/)

I padded quietly through the dimly lit gift shop, pulling the straps of my backpack tighter over my shoulders like a security blanket. When I reached the opposite door, I leaned my head against it and tried to calm my rapidly beating heart. 

Taking several deep breaths, I slid Scottss keycard through the blinking card reader and was rewarded with a green flash and another soft click. The creature was right where Id left it, as still as the statue it was pretending to be. 

I took my time wandering around the room, my eyes never leaving Jameson Scotts prize exhibit. If the demon was as satisfied and successfully warded as Scott bragged it was, than the creature either wouldnt notice or wouldnt care about my presence.  I was starting to hope he was right. 

When I finally came around to face the statue, I approached it slowly and unbuckled the velvet rope with a shaky hand. I was so close to it now that all I could see when I looked up was the underside of its gigantic head. I suddenly wondered if years of schooling would help me read the words inscribed on the statues stone platform. I bent down and started to pull up the velvet covering when I heard a quiet scrape above me, like stone on stone. It was a sound Id heard before, in the soundtrack of my nightmares.
 
 So I had been right all along, the statue wasnt dormant. It was a hollow victory. I dropped the velvet and backed away from the statue, trying to determine what had moved. Nothing had changed to my naked eye, but I know what I heard.

Bumping against the back wall, I decided to play a wild card. I needed it to move perceptibly if I wanted proof that the thing was still dangerous. I turned away from the demon and faced the wall, using an arm to brace myself. I couldnt believe I was doing this.

I pushed my chips all in. 

Do you really think Im scared of you, after all these years?" I asked quietly, my voice echoing around the room like a gunshot. "Youre just a piece of rock now. Harmless to me. 

 I held my breath and waited. Nothing.

Feeling both disappointed and relieved, I sighed and turned around, dropping the keycard as well as my jaw. Though it hadn't made a sound, the statue was now not only facing me, but leaning out, as far off its stone platform as it could. Its mouth was open and, almost imperceptibly, growing wider by the second. 

You cant leave your platform. I breathed, as much to myself as the creature. My whole body was shaking and I was quietly backing up, slowly, slowly to the door. I'd gotten what I'd come for, now it was time to leave.

It happened in the breath of a second. There was a sudden crack as the demons tail whipped through the air behind it from one side to the other, as though it were not made of stone but of flesh and blood. The glass encasing it on either side shattered, the makeshift wall behind split in two and the velvet ropes came crashing down; one of the poles sent a sigil flying across the room. 

I screamed like Id never screamed before as the creatures neck seemed to stretch across the room toward me, one of its wards no longer effective. I turned my back on it and ran for the door realizing too late that the keycard now lay under a heap of rubble. I reached the double doors and tried to jerk them open, hoping they werent locked from the other side. They were.  The creature was once again still as stone, everything but its eyes, which followed my every move, hungrily.
I beat on the door, yelling for security and wondering if I was doomed and which thought would be my last. In my hysterical panic I suddenly remembered how I had escaped this fate 13 years before. I stumbled back from the doors as much as I dared and ran at them, shoulder first.

They moved, creaked even, but ultimately laughed at my efforts. These were no rotten, decaying church doors. Crazed with fear I backed up to try again and this time just as my shoulder reached the door, it opened from the other side and I went spilling over on top of something hard  or someone. 

He rolled over and I passively registered that Id landed on an enraged Bannock. He was standing and pulling me up by the strap of my backpack before the door had even closed behind us.  

Bannock struggled to say something, trying several times, but was too angry for words. I didnt care; I threw my arms around him just happy to be on the other side of the door. 

He didnt hug me back, just froze stiff and waited for me to get off of him. When I finally pulled back, I pulled my hood down and looked him full in the face. He wore a decidedly guarded look.   

Did you see what it did? I asked, pushing hair back from my face, That thing is not dormant at all. Tell your boss that, and that it needs to be moved. Tonight, if possible.

In lieu of a response, Bannock grabbed my arm and headed toward the lobby. Since it was away from the exhibit room, I didnt care; he could take me to jail if he wanted, as long as Jameson Scott heard what happened here. Id made my point to him and lived to tell the tale. 

Or had I? I suddenly wondered.  Honestly if Id learned anything in that room, it had been that the creature hadnt forgotten me- the girl that got away. My life was a black mark on its record, an insult.  And I had gone into its lair and challenged. What did I *think* was going to happen?

Of one thing I was abruptly certain: it wouldnt stop until it had my life. The creature would burn through a hundred cities, perhaps a thousand, to claim me. It had told me all of this somehow, hadnt it?

I suddenly realized my mistake. The creature had been dormant when Id arrived in Lannenburg as itd been dormant 13 years before in Deepwood. And once again I had awoken it from a harmless slumber. How many would pay the price this time?   How many people had to die before the end? 

Finally understanding the true cost of my arrogance, I let out a muffled cry and faltered, wondering with revulsion if perhaps I should just go back and face my fate. 

Wait. I coughed, trying to ply the guards fingers from my arm.

Bannock suddenly spun me around and pinned me against a wall, his arms braced on either side of my head. My eyes snapped up at him in shock and I recoiled from what I saw there.

"What the fuck are you doing here?"

"I was, I was just-

"Why did you come back, Katie? After all these fucking years?"

My objection died in my throat. But it couldnt be. It wasnt possible. And yetsomehow it was.

My legs gave out under me, but Jamie caught me on the way down. He was older than he should have been, and stronger than I'd ever thought the skinny kid from Middlesbrough could be. But his eyes hadn't changed, and it was Jamie all the same. Even his expressions were familiar to me, I realized. What I'd first thought was seething anger was actually just barely controlled fear. Had the creature killed me after all? Was I swirling in the dark abyss with Jamie and all the others who had been taken?

"Jamie?" My voice broke over his name.

"Christ, Katie, you need to leave now and never come back. Hell, leave the country if you can. Hell never stop looking for you now."

I couldnt register what he was saying. Who wouldnt? Leave what country? Jamiehow was Jamie here? He kept me pinned there; his hold rigid, his eyes desperate and little bit pissed off.

"Jamie," I tried again, "how did you..."

"How did I know you'd come here? When has the word no ever kept you from something you wanted?"

"No, I mean how-"

"We'll take her from here, Bannock.  A voice behind him interrupted me. 

Jamie slowly turned to face the three men, only one of which I recognized.

"This one has been too much trouble. I want her gone." Jamie returned with ice in his voice.

"Mr. Scott says we're not to take orders from you anymore, Bannock. Give her here."

Jamie suddenly pushed me out of the way and I went sliding across the floor, the wind knocked out of me.  A rushing filled my ears as I tried desperately to catch my breath. When my hearing came back, Jamie was yelling at me.

 Go!

I looked back to see two men down and Jamie struggling with the third. My sneakers struggled for purchase on the slick marble floor and when they finally found it, I was up and running toward the lobby on the wings of adrenaline. I suddenly heard a sound like a book slamming onto a table. 

I spun around just as Jamie went down, clutching his shoulder. He fell on top of the man hed been struggling with  who was now unconscious.   Blood began to drip over his fingers and I went sliding across the floor as I tried to stop to double back for him. 

Jamie started to say something but passed out mid sentence. His hand dropped from his shoulder and thin tendrils of blood began to race each other down his chest.

"Well, now that is impressive," Jameson Scott stepped forward from where hed been leaning against the door. "And Im not impressed by much at my age."

I stumbled over to Jamie, but Scott stopped me with a single click of his gun. He walked over and rested a foot on Jamies chest. I froze where I was. 

"I saw you take my keycard, you know. You played the role perfectly. In fact, *everything* went according to plan. Except him. Scott kicked Jamie in the ribs but he didnt make a sound.

"What do you want?" I spat.

"Your name came up. I want you to die."

"Why?"

Scott gave a pretentious scoff. "This isn't a James Bond movie, Miss Ross, I don't need to explain myself to you."

"But you will, wont you? You want me to know how clever you are." I was playing with fire but why not? We were far beyond caution now. 

"Hmm, you're quite bright. There might have been a place for you on my staff...if things had been different."

"Don't flatter yourself. Why then? Why are you giving a demon what it wants? Didnt it kill someone you loved?"

"My daughter, actually. And why? Its my gift to a world I was born too late into. You know, I was fifty by the time the internet was invented - fifty! What sad irony then, that I was a technological genius. Oh but the universe does love its sick jokes. Do you realize Ive single-handedly guided the history of modern technology? Its true. But I reached my seventies and then my eighties, and my vision began to fail, my hands would shake, I'd forget coding. I could barely manage to read at one point.

I'd made millions, but I hadn't even started. I decided the world couldn't afford to lose me yet. So, I tracked down every piece of ancient lore I could that may help me reclaim my youth. Most of it was rubbish, of course, but I was desperate. Id almost given up  until Metaraxes found me.

I knew what he was as soon as I saw him. So I bought him and warded him using the sigils I'd read about in ancient text.  Of course, there was an expensive trial and error period; many of my staff were killed in the process. But eventually, we discovered the right sigils. The first thing I did was track down the man whose name was etched into the granite at Metaraxess feet. I presented him for sacrifice and I was rewarded.

That was six years ago. I adopted a new name and started a new company. All was going well until your name came up about four years ago. It really stumped me because Metaraxes only desires those who are connected to him, somehow. I didn't know who you were and you're far from the only Caitlin Ross in the world. I did *try* several others. Metaraxes would take them, for certain, but the name never changed. I was getting desperate.

So you can imagine how happy I am that you showed up on my doorstep.  God is telling me that he approves of my methods and that I must stay alive for the good of humanity. My company is in the middle of revolutionizing surgical robotics, for Christs sake! I will take a few lives to save a million."

Furious at his arrogance, I struggled to keep my voice level. "Don't lie to yourself, Scott, youre no hero, just an old man afraid to die."

"No, Caitlin, I'm just a man refusing to grow old. What can I say? Im determined and resilient.  I want to be young until the day I die."

"Thats not resilience, thats vanity. Vanity is what youre buying with my life. 

"Theres always a price for social change, Miss Ross. And today, the cost is you. Oh, but you look upset. Don't be afraid of death, my dear, not for such a worthy cause.

"I'm not afraid of death and I don't care about your diabolical plan, I just want you to get to the goddamn point." Jamies breathing was growing shallow and my voice dripped with animosity.

"As you wish." Scott nodded at something behind me and then there was darkness.

When I woke, I was lying on a cold marble floor, my brown mess of hair fanned out underneath me, stiff with dried blood and my wrists bound. I sat up slowly and tried to brush the hair out of my eyes. I knew where I was, there was no point in turning around to see it, but I did anyway.

It wasn't the fact that my name was engraved at the base of the statue that the velvet cloth had covered. It wasn't the wards, which had been moved from the demons feet to the doors and walls of the room. It wasn't even the fact that the demon's head was turned as to be looking directly down at me.

No, what terrified me most in that room was the man leaning against the wall, hands bound behind his back, as condemned to death as I was.

The blood on his chest had dried and he was awake; his eyes only partly open, watching me with an unreadable expression.

"You look like shit, Jamie." I said matter-of-factly as I pulled myself up to lean against the base of the statue, the only thing nearby.

"I've been busy," He said, his mouth curling up into a sarcastic smile.

"I'm sorry I killed you. Again." I tried to smile back, if only to keep the tears at bay.

"Nah, well survive this.

I admire your optimism, but look around. I rested my elbows on my knees and sunk my head into my arms.

I lived through it once before didnt I?

"Yeah about that - how?"

"About a week after you left things started disappearing around town: people, buildings, even roads. No one remembered them but me. Then one day, I woke up in an empty house. My dad and my brother were gone. So, I fled to the only place I knew was safe."

"The Damned Church."

Jamie shrugged. I figured it was the one place the demon would never go. I don't know how long I lived there, but it felt like years. I slept at the church and traveled to nearby towns to steal what I needed to live. And then, one day, the towns were gone. All of them."

As he spoke, I watched him, memorizing every detail of his face. Even when I was nothing, I hoped something was left of me, a little piece that would remember him.

"So, I decided to find the thing. My dad was gone; my mom didn't remember me, and the only person who knew who I was lived a thousand miles away. So I went from town to town until I found it. It was just there; standing in the center of town. Nobody even thought it was weird.

I was a pro at drawing sigils by then since Id spent some much time at Deepwood, and sigils have to be perfect to work, so I tried to ward it. It would take a little while, but the statue always managed to break them. Id find it a little further from its base every night. People didnt even seem to notice the statue had moved, what they did notice, however, was some kid loitering around their town.  Since I looked older, and the town was getting wary of me anyway, I joined the local police force and spent my nights on patrol downtown, keeping an eye on the thing, reapplying sigils. Occasionally, I would wake up outside and I'd know my wards had finally failed. Then I'd have to track it to a new town and start all over."

"Why didn't it just kill you?"

"I asked myself that until a few years ago when your name came up. I think it needed me - to find you. Ironically, in the end it didn't need me at all. You came anyway."

I thought about that and wondered for the first time if I actually *had* come back to prove myself sane. Had I really intended to kill it? Or prove I'd been right? Or had it actually been about Jamie all along?

"It took a long time, and a lot of towns," he continued, "but I finally figured out what I was doing wrong. A sigil will slow it down, but in order to stop it the ward needs to be blessed. And not just by anyone - by the second son of a Roman catholic, preferably from Assisi, Italy, or at least near the region. Don't ask me how I figured that out."

"So what happened to your second son from Assisi, Italy?"

"He disappeared."

"Shit." I pushed my hair back again with my bound wrists.

"Yeah. By that point I was a sheriff and Id been a city over. I came back to town to find my exit missing. The statue was gone. And that's when Jameson Scott got a hold of it."

"And that's why were you protecting him?"

"You think I was protecting *him*? No, he was transparent about his intentions from the start. I applied to be on his detail but was denied - no name, no experience. I only got on because I was able to take out all of his bodyguards in a sort of hand to hand combat trial. Guess all those trips through the police academy finally paid off."

"Agreed. How does Jameson Scott know more about that statue than we do?

 Because he had almost 80 people on his staff who did nothing but travel every corner of the globe looking for any scrap of information on Metaraxes.  We arent the first ones to live to tell the tale. Just the first to stick around.  I did all I could to keep people away from that thing. A name would be engraved on it one day, and a new name the next. It took me a long time to figure out what he was doing. And by then...your name had come up. Hes became obsessed with you and I damned sure wasnt going to let him find you."

"Well that explains why you were mad when you saw me."

"Mad? Katie, I've never been more terrified in my life. I spent years leading him down false paths only to have you present yourself like a lamb for slaughter."

"I'm sorry, Jamie. I wasted all your fucking time.  You spent 13 years trying to protect me and I spent all that time trying to forget you." 

"Well, it's no less than I wanted for you. To forget about this place, and me."

I heard the familiar stone on stone sound from above me. 

"Is there any chance of reasoning with him? Your boss, I mean?"

"Not likely," his voice was dark. "He fed his own daughter to that thing."

He what?!

"For the greater good, he said."

God, Jamie, I don't want to die. I don't want *you* to die."

"You're not going to die here, not today."

I ignored his optimism. "Why do you think it hasn't killed us yet?"

Jamie sighed. "It's trying. Scott kept a close watch over his demon but I managed to get one thing by him. That statue is sitting on a sigil the size of a mini cooper. It's not blessed - but it's big."

"You're a brilliant bastard, James Karras."

"Well, I've sure had a lot of time." I heard a clicking sound and Jamie stood up, tossing a now worthless pair of handcuffs on the floor.

He walked over and stood me up; using whatever tool he had picked his own cuffs with to free me. I heard them click but when they fell to the floor all I heard with the loud grinding of stone on stone again. It was louder and longer this time.
 
"Don't look at it, Katie. Don't look up."

"Jamie..." I breathed, terrified. Suddenly, a face appeared behind Jamie. But this time, I wasnt hypnotized by it. Jamie saw the color drain from my face and grabbed me.

"Follow me- now!" He yelled, pushed me in front of him to the giftshop door. I heard more movement from behind us and turned around while Jamie typed a long sequence of numbers into the card reader keypad. The creature had turned its head and it was watching me. It was alive, as alive as it had ever been. The statue took a step off its platform which shook the museum floor. Its movements were silent, yet fluid and flexible, like a cartoon on mute.

"Jamie..."

"Working on it!" Suddenly the key pad flashed green and the door clicked open. Jamie drew a black marker out of his pocket and drew a long line down the middle of the sigil, negating it. 

"What are you doing?!"

"Just trust me." Jamie pushed me out the door.

We slammed it behind us and tore across the giftshop to the exit. The door was locked. I turned around to tell Jamie as much but he was already hurling a table through the window. It shattered just as I saw the door on the other side of the room begin to bend as it was pushed in from the other side.

"How did you unlock that door?" I asked as we ran across the parking lot.

"Scott isn't the only one who's good with programming." Jamie yelled back. 

I followed him to a black jeep sitting at the edge of the parking lot. We jumped in just as a loud bang echoed across the asphalt, god only knew what it meant. Jamie shoved his keys in the ignition and turned the car over. The beginning chords to Highway to Hell blasted from the speakers.

"Why not?" I shrugged as I turned it up. Jamie nodded and peeled out of the parking lot. We tore through town like the devil himself was chasing us - which wasn't far from the truth.

It was early, the first rays of sunlight streaming through the trees as we hit the highway. We hadn't gone more than 5 miles when a white SUV appeared behind us. It followed at a considerable distance.

"Why aren't they overtaking us?"

"Because this is what he wants. Scott knows where we're going."

"Where *are* we going?"

"Deepwood."

"Fuck." I said as I leaned back in the chair. But I trusted Jamie, so I didn't object.  "Wont it take the creature days to make it there?" I asked, eyeing Jamie's speedometer, which was at 90. 

"It doesn't always move like that. It sometimes travels on another plane. I can't explain it. Everything changes and warps around that thing, even time. Thats why I'm about 8 years older than I should be."

He suddenly whipped off the road and headed for the treeline. The truck behind us did the same and we maneuvered randomly through the trees, though I figured Jamie knew where we were going. I held on for dear life and watched him expertly navigate the almost hostile terrain or downed trees and deep ditches. 

"How far?" I asked after ten minutes.

"6 miles but you know how time is out here." 

Did I ever. Four minutes yet somehow six miles later we bumped over a set of railroad tracks and arrived at the Damned Church, which looked smaller and more impotent than it did in my nightmares. The front door opened easily this time and I gave an involuntary shudder when I saw the Jesus statue - looking more judgmental now than ever before. The trapdoor was open.

"You lived here for years and you never closed the trap door?" 

"Believe me, I tried." Jamie grabbed my hand and guided me to the hole in the floor. "We have to go down there."

"Fuck no. I snatched my hand away.

"It's the only way this will end, Katie."

Youve got to be kidding me, I muttered as I took the first reluctant step down.

"Wait, I suddenly stopped. You said it wouldn't ever come back here."

"It would for you." 

Jamie followed behind me and took the stairs down, on shaky step at a time. Jamie followed behind me, flashlight in hand. I didnt see it until right before we reached the bottom. The demon was already here waiting for us. It stood in the same position we'd first found him in 13 years before, though this time its face was not stone. The demons eyes swept across the room in a wide arc, his tail was wrapped around the bottom of the staircase.

"If he was already down here, why couldnt we stay up there?" I whispered.

"He wasn't."

There were no wards to protect us now, and no where to run. I couldn't help thinking this was a bad plan.

"Well, he's here now, so let's go."

"We can't Katie. If we leave now, he will too."

"Well then what's your plan, Jamie?"

Jamie said nothing, just stared at the demon, who was now staring back at him. Suddenly I felt something like a tug, in the pit of my stomach. I stepped back, and then it happened again. I looked up into the creatures eyes, which had moved to mine and suddenly realized what was happening. There was another tug, harder this time, and I felt my mind, if not my body, being pulled toward the demon's head. A long black tongue jutted out to welcome me and the creatures mouth began to widen. So this was it. The nothingness.

The demons mouth was so wide I could have simply walked into it, if I had a body. The blackness started to close in on all sides, creating a sort of tunnel vision and then, in a violent jolt, I was snapped back into my body, a perfect sigil drawn on my chest in black marker. The creature screamed, an earsplitting sound, and Jamie flung me over his shoulder before I had even reestablished my bearings. We were to the top of the staircase in under a minute, the demon still emitting a deafening wail. 

"I'm sorry!" He yelled "I was sure it would come for me first!"

We burst into the nave, and Jamie, seeing our company before I did, pushed me across the alter toward the crucifixion, which I took out as I fell. I scrambled back, kicking it away from me as I did. By the time I looked up, Jameson Scott was standing in front of the trapdoor, a gun to Jamie's head. His men hung back, but looked eager to get involved at a word from their boss. 

"Get back down there, Miss Ross." 

Fuck you. My last word was drowned out by a loud cracking sound that echoed  through the little church as the spiral staircase came crashing down below. 

"Katie, don't-" Jamie caught a knee to the ribs, some of which I was pretty sure were already broken. I scrambled back further. 

"There's- there's no staircase now. There's no way to get down there."

"Oh, sure there is." Scott sneered. His hired men laughed. "You're going to die either way. At least *this* way, you'll save his life. Metaraxes is trapped down there for the time being, so its to the cellar you must go. Perhaps you shouldnt have injured him by breaking his bond *mid-feed*."

"Katie, Jamie growled. "Dont be fucking stupid. Just run.

"Fuck no, Jamie. I didn't leave you in this place then and I wont now." It was time to pay my dues. I stood up to walk to the edge of the trapdoor. Perhaps, if fate was kind, I would die when I hit the floor thirty feet below. 

I looked up at Jamie, intending my last words to be for him. I knew the moment he realized that intent. 

Jamie jerked his body forward and threw himself and Scott into the dark hole between us.

"No!" I screamed as Scotts men scattered out the door. I skid over to the side of the hole, tripping over the smaller statue on the way.

'I'm here," came a pained groan from Jamie, who was just barely clutching onto the side. Thanking every deity I knew of, I pulled him out of the hole and back into the nave. His wound was bleeding fresh blood and I knew we didn't have much time. I laid him on his back, as he started to slip in unconsciousness, applying pressure to his shoulder. A moan came from the trapdoor beside us.

"Help me. Please... I'm hurt." So Scott had survived the fall. I grimaced and pulled myself over to the edge to peer into the darkness below. I could see nothing but the creature was no longer screaming. My blood began to boil as I let Jameson Scott wail away his swan song. 

"Please...its staring at me, I can feel it. Pleasename your price, Ill pay it. Just save me"

I laughed. "Oh now, why would I do that, Mr. Scott? This is what you wanted, after all. You get to be young until the day you die." 

Suddenly the trapdoor slammed shut, Jamie standing over it, as the entire building began to shake. The edges around the door grew bright, like molten metal before darkening like a blown out flame.

"Will it hold?" I yelled to Jamie over the increasingly loud earthquake. "Is it blessed?"

"Some say by God himself."

"I'd say that counts." I said to myself as I tried to stand up on the violently shaking floor.

Jamie hoisted me up next to him and ran for the door as bit of ceiling began to cave in. The door to the church swung open of its own volition before we got there and slammed shut behind us. The church came down in a butt of dust and splintered wood. When all had settled, Jamie was barely conscious. I walked him to the car and pushed him into the passenger seat. He was out before Id shut the door. I took one last look at the pile of rubble before climbing into the drivers seat and starting the car. I followed the same train tracks home that got us out of Deepwood when we were kids. I made it to the road without ever looking back.

I can tell you exactly how long Jameson Scott lived - 4 days. By the dawn of that forth day, he, and all of his inventions, abruptly disappeared from the world. There were a few I was sad to see go, like the rise of inductive charging and EyeGlass. You would have loved EyeGlass and you probably did, honestly.  Contact lenses that were actually cameras: they put GoPro out of business. I could never afford it, but you may have had one. I miss those YouTube videos. 

Jamie spent a month recovering from his gunshot wound. After he was released from the hospital, we spent a few weeks weighing our options. In the end, we decided to hunt down people like Jameson Scott and the powers they wielded. You don't know about them, and if we have our way, you never will. Due to Jamie's time with Scott, we have some good leads. We have a lot of blood on our hands to atone for, and a lifetime to do it in. 

Deepwood is dead; only Jamie and I even know where it is, so the town dies with us. I wouldn't try to find it if I were you - Ive changed a lot of details: names of towns, names of roads. Perhaps even *when* this all happened. I won't tell you and you don't want to know, anyway.

Somewhere, out in a hundred mile sea of trees and dirt lies the demons door. It's still there, under a pile of rotting detritus that used to be a small church. The door may be found again someday, it may even be opened. But one thing is for damn sure: it sure as hell wont be because of me.

 Guilt can be a very strong and blinding motivation.  




 Yes, well, I never said I was smart. And Happy Cake Day, stranger. 




 I'm sorry, I ran out of room. I will post the rest tomorrow.  




 [The Lost Town of Deepwood](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1xn677/the_lost_town_of_deepwood_pennsylvania/)

Harrisburg is an antiquated, yet charming Pennsylvanian town on the Susquehanna River with roots reaching back into the 18th century. At least, thats what the tourism brochure read. Id really have to take their word for it.  I had researched a lot of Pennsylvania townships in the last year, but this wasnt one of them.

I handed the brochure back to the tall, red faced girl behind the hotel desk. She sniffed loudly as she took it and unceremoniously slid my credit card back across the counter at me.

Thanks, I muttered.

The girl dropped a brass key on the counter which I eyed with suspicion. I hadnt seen a hotel with actual brass keys since I was a kid. I didnt know if it was my limited funds or Harrisburgs antiquated charm at work, but either way, it sent an involuntary shudder down my spine.

"Room 217. Check outs at 10. The girl said, wiping her small, watery eyes with the back of her sleeve.

I picked up my luggage and shoved off to find my room. 

Eager to be done with it, I hadnt bother to ask where to find room 217. When I finally located it on the other side of the building, I was exhausted and ready for whatever awaited me on the other side of the door. It was as youd suspect: dated, droll and dusty. I took a short shower and spread my maps out on the painfully flat yet somehow still lumpy hotel mattress.

It was strange to be back in Pennsylvania after all these years. Honestly, I was just happy it was still here. I had spent years trying to pretend I'd dreamed it all. Trying to convince myself that I'd had a very vivid psychotic breakdown and I'd never actually been to Pennsylvania at all. And I might have believed it too - if it weren't for Jamie.

He was as real to me as the face in the mirror. I couldn't have dreamed him up if I'd wanted to. And if he had been real, than so had everything else. The Damned Church, the Demon and the hell I'd brought down on Middlesbrough. How many more had died since then? I needed to see for myself. I needed to prove I wasn't crazy, even if doing it meant I would have to face the consequences of my actions - the death.  

I stared at my notes and topographical maps until my vision began to blur. Id been researching and preparing for this trip for a year and yet, here I was, in Pennsylvania, still with no real direction.

It had been thirteen years since Id stepped foot in this state and only for one of them had I considered coming back. 

Id lived only half a life for  the last decade, slowly suffocating under the heavy, pungent cloak of guilt. Usually, I could escape it in Ambien laced dreams or when I was utterly black out drunk - which is an easy order to fill when you work in a bar. But a year ago, my tricks had abruptly stopped working and it had been too long since Id come up for air. Id known it was time to go back.

I spent an hour trying to find a comfortable position on the worn-out hotel mattress. When that failed, I picked up the maps again and studied their details, though Id memorized them all. I suppose I was waiting for something to just click, some small detail Id overlooked that would suddenly make all the difference; a clue as clear as daybreak that had been in front of me all along. But none came and when I woke again it was buried under a pile of legal pads and maps and suffering a sore back.

I showered again, not trusting the comforter, and reluctantly drank the motor oil that passed for breakfast blend coffee. I packed up my research, checked out of the hotel and sat in my car watching the sun slowly brighten the populated downtown area. At least the creature hadnt made its way here; this city had a population of around 50,000. But how many other cities with similar populations were gone because of me? It wasnt something I wanted an answer to.

Since I had no other data to go on, my plan was to drive to the least populated areas and see if what wasnt there would give me a clue to what had once been. Basically, I was looking for an area that by all logic should have a city  but didnt.

I put the Ford Focus in drive and headed west out of town.
Half a day was spent driving to the middle of the state and another two days aimlessly driving around central Pennsylvania looking for something familiar; a mountain, a water tower, a road, *anything*. But it was as if Id never lived here at all.

On the fourth morning, discouraged and frustrated, I checked out of yet another shitty motel. I only had three more days before my flight back to Arizona and so far the trip had been utterly useless.

The man at the front desk took my key and gestured toward the continental breakfast of prepackaged muffins and 
horse-piss coffee.

No thanks, I grumbled.

Wheryeadded?

Huh? I raised an eyebrow at him.

Where ye headed? He repeated, more slowly. I couldnt place his accent, the closest I could get was maybe southern.

Oh, ah, I dont know.

Well, if yer eaded down the 320, gas up before ya leave town. There aint no gas stations or towns between here and Lannenburg.

Butthats like 90 miles away.

Yep, never understood it myself. People get stuck on that road all the time, blowin tires and runnin outta gas. I dont know why the government hasnt done sumthin about that.

Because theyre broke! Someone yelled from the back office.

Yep, thats it, most likely. The state aint got money for it.

Ill get gas before I go, I promised and received an approving nod in return.

I practically ran out the door. For days Id been looking for the out-of-place, the not-quite-right, the bizarre and this waswell, it was odd, at least. And it was all I had.

I gassed up before I left town and followed the signs to the 320. As promised, it was nothing but dark asphalt for miles. No exits, rest stops, signs or ever mile markers. This was it. It just had to be.

Since there was no one else on the road, I drove well under the speed limit taking in every detail. Eventually I began to notice that periodically there would a gap. Not in the foliage, but in the coloring of it. 

Every so often, a grove of trees would be duller, sicker. It was something youd only notice if you were looking for it. So the creature, as Id taken to calling it, could technically give life (in the process of filing in the hole of previous existence) but not very good life.  The fauna in these spots was  weaker and bore dull, almost muted coloring.

I continued noting these spots until I couldnt count them anymore. These had likely been cities or homes of people with lives, families, futures, all taken from them because of me. I felt the panic begin to claim the edges of my vision and quickly popped a Xanax. My panic attacks had become unbearable after Middlesbrough. I suffered from them still. The edges of my vision got hazy and I was able to relax a fraction.

At some point, I processed the presence of the dilapidated railroad tracks running parallel to the road. Id noticed them early on, but my mind had hidden the significance of this until now. They may not have been *the* tracks, but to me, it was a sign that I was on the right track (so to speak).

I was close. I had to be. And if Lannenburg was still there, that meant the creature hadnt made it that far yet.

I somehow knew - like I knew that Id once lived somewhere off this road - that the creature had been moving north. But it hadnt claimed Lannenburg yet. Why? Was it satiated? Had it left the area? Or was it just slow moving? Whatever the answer, I felt Id learn it in Lannenburg.

As I reached the outskirts of the city, I saw my first road sign since Id merged onto the 320.

*Lannenburg*

*Next 17 exits*

I decided to take the exit that would get me into the heart of downtown Lannenburg, if there was one. I hadnt researched the city of Lannenburg either, thinking it was too far north to matter. And yet, here I was.

The downtown area began to take shape off my right like the Damned Church had in the woods so long ago. But I didnt need spray paint to find my way anymore. I exited the highway and drove around the cityscape until I found a centrally located hotel that I could afford. I parked and heaved my bags out of the car, hoping they had vacancy.

They did, I was told by the overly flirty college senior behind the front desk, slinging his guitar behind his back.

Do you have wifi? I asked as he handed me the key card.

We do, but theres a $10 a day charge for the password.

Damn. I was on an extremely tight budget.

But I can give it to you for free if He let his voice trail off suggestively.

If what? I raised a skeptical eyebrow at him.

If you let me write a song about you-  he righted my credit card receipt so he could read it -Caitlin.

I sighed. Ok, yeah, fine. At this point there wasnt much Id say no to. I was going on four days of restless sleep.

He eagerly gave me the password and I retired to my room, first floor, thankfully. I took out my shitty laptop, connected to the hotels equally shitty wifi and pulled up the Wikipedia page for Lannenburg.

It was a larger city for this part of the state, around 55,000 residents, mostly due to the fact that Lannenburg hosted a state university. It was a progressive, young, educated town filled with hipsters and young professionals. Where to even begin?

I threw my notes, my phone and my GPS in my backpack and decided to start with the front desk of the motel, much to my own dread.

The college kid whod checked me in was strumming chords on his guitar and softly humming.

Excuse me.

He looked up at me and winked. Youre pretty eager, foxy lady, and I like that. But songs take time to write, even for the most talented-

Yeah, actually, I was just wondering, where can I find the university? I interrupted - suppressing an eyeroll.

"Mama, this whole city is a campus! I mean, whered you wanna go? You a new student? Ill show you around. I get off in-

No, Id like to find the, ah, the- This had been a horrible mistake. *Think of something quick, genius.* -admissions office. I need to talk to admissions.

Ah, well, thats about half a mile down Rooker Street. Thats the one-

-running in front of the building, got it, thanks.

He started to say something else, perhaps which way to go down Rooker, but I was already out the door. Not knowing what else to do  and wanting to get as far from the poor kid as possible  I picked a direction and started walking.

Even though it was May, I was still freezing. I hadnt been built for the far north and my blood had thinned out living in Arizona. With my backpack and my age I probably would have passed for any other college student on campus  if it wasnt for the hoodie I had pulled tightly around me.

I envied them all. Kids just a year or two younger than me going to classes, hanging out with their friends, making  stupid yet amusing mistakes. It could have been me, once. But I hadn't grown up like them. Even since Middlesbrough I had struggled with school and life in general. I couldn't focus, I couldn't laugh; I became a sarcastic, guilt-ridden introvert and I lost all my friends. Then my dad died and my mom started to look at me differently. I stopped talking about Middlesbrough the day I heard the word "hospital" whispered to my mother by a psychiatrist.

Even though I stopped trying to prove it had all been real, my mother never really saw me as her little girl again. I'd moved out at 18 and lived alone for years, working in an English pub, trying to forget how many people were probably dead because me - including Jamie, the knife that dug the deepest.

I walked the downtown area all day. I didnt know what I was doing, where I was going, who I should approach, or what I should ask them - I just knew I was in the right place. Id been drawn here for a reason; I felt it in my gut. This was where I was supposed to be. But for the fifth time in as many days I had to ask myself: what now?

I suppose I could have spent days wondering around Lannenburg. I could have left empty handed and never known what happened all those years ago. I could have never found him. But, as fate would have it, it only took half a day to find what I was looking for.

It was well past noon and I had stopped at a small caf to eat a sandwich. Since the restaurant was packed wall to wall with students, I went outside and leaned against the brick wall by the door.

I suppose I noticed it because it was so brightly colored. Or maybe because it was the only piece of litter I had seen all morning. Or, just maybe, it was simply because I was supposed to. But for whatever the reason, when a bright red flyer blew past my feet, I reached out to step on it.

Curious, I bent down to pick it up and read the heading:

**Tethen History Museum  Lannenburg, PA**

**Upcoming Exhibitions**

**13th-14th Century Judeo-Christian Relics and Artifacts**

Below that was a blurb about the museum, nothing too interesting. And below *that* was a description of the exhibits to be unveiled.

I skimmed down the list quickly seeing little of interest  until the very bottom.

*Statue of the Demon Metaraxes*

My mouth fell open. It was too much of a coincidence, nothing to be ignored. I checked the date on the flyer. May 2nd 2014: 3 weeks ago. I threw the rest of my sandwich in the trash and took off. Id seen the museum that morning and I knew where exactly where to find it.

It was only three blocks away and I got there in under five minutes, flew up the building steps and stumbled straight to the cashier window.

Student ID, please. The old man said, flatly.

Im not a student.

Well, you look-

How much?

Eleven dollars. I was gladly willing to pay.

I didnt stop to grab a map, instead joining a tour group already in progress. The museum, I could tell, was a veritable labyrinth and I certainly didnt want to get lost, not in here, not with that thing - if indeed, it really was what I half hoped, half dreaded it could be.

It took the longest twenty minutes of my life, but we finally came to the room Id been waiting for.

"Now behind this door is our newest exhibition on ancient Judeo-Christian artifacts. Please do not try to touch anything or you will be escorted out. These pieces are centuries old and may be damaged by the lightest touch.

*If you have behind that door what I suspect you do, than I 
highly doubt it.*

Also, please no flash photography.

My heart beat a million miles a minute as the docent opened the double doors and my group was shuffled in. I lingered toward the back, letting everyone go in front of me.
I had come thousands of miles and done months of research to find that statue, to prove I wasnt insane, yet when the time came to possibly face my nightmare, I was hesitant.
Finally I was the last and the docent had to wave me in with a polite but impatient hand.

There were about a hundred things in that room. All sorts of things, really: sculptures, paintings, pottery, even other statues. But I only had eyes for the thing in the middle.

It was larger than I remembered. Not the twelve feet I had guessed, it was actually closer to twenty. But every detail of its face and body was exactly as Id remembered, though it was positioned differently now.

In the church, all those years ago, it had seemed as if it was standing, waiting yet content. But now it was positioned as if ready to leap off the stone square that it stood upon, its tail was paused in midair, instead of wrapped idly around its legs as itd been before.

Though it was taller than Id remembered, I could at least see its face this time. It wasnt particularly scary, just an empty, stony face, far from the hungry, animated one it became when it woke.

And like the crucifixion statue in the Damned Church, it had eyes only for me.

The rest of my group took photos, oo-ing and ah-ing as they made their way around the room. I stood directly where I was, against the now closed door, going no further. The docent walked around the room, discussing notable pieces of the collection and I only moved from the door when she finally stood before the creature.

"And, finally, the jewel of this exhibition: a granite statue from the 14th century. This is a representation of Metaraxes, a lesser known demon of Christian mythology. It is unique in its size as well as its crisp detail, especially for something so old. Our conservationists are unable to discover its place of origin or creator.

I edged closer and closer to the red velvet rope. Its eyes followed my every step. The room seemed to grow hotter. 

The docent moved to the side so people could get pictures in front of the statue. Though I couldn't blame them, I barely kept from yelling. This was madness.

The stone platform on which the demon stood was covered in red velvet, which pooled at the creatures feet. It hid the words inscribed on the front of the granite stand that Jamie and I couldnt read those many years ago.

The docent droned on about nothing and I read the description plaque.

*14th Century representation of the Demon Metaraxes*

*Artist Unknown*

No shit.

And then I saw what I didnt know Id been looking for  the triangles. The symbols I would never forget, etched into the doors of the Damned Church. And once I found one, I found another and another. There were half a dozen of them. *So thats how theyre doing it.* They (whoever they were) had placed wards all around the base of the creatures stand. 

The museum not only knew what this thing was, they knew about the sigils on the doors of the Damned Church and were *using* them to trap the statue here. The revelation was like a punch to the face. Someone was aware of what this statue really was and was blatantly risking innocent lives anyway. It was insane.

In a panic, I turned to find the docent and saw her conversing politely with an elderly couple. 

Excuse me! I interrupted loudly. 

Yes? She failed to mask her irritation at my rudeness.

Where did the museum acquire this statue?

This piece is on loan from a private collection.

Whose?

It belongs to Jameson Scott. The docent, feeling the exchange was over, turned back to finish her conversation. 

Jameson Scott. I knew that name, but from where? As our group began to move out of the room I took one last look at the creature  Metaraxes  and shuddered. Its eyes had never strayed from me. I took my phone out and pulled up a Wikipedia page on Jameson Scott. I had to know who could be this stupid.

He was young  my age  but wealthy, had his own company and well known in the tech industry for multiple inventions. The words brilliant, pioneer and industry leader were scattered throughout his Wikipedia page, which had no picture. At the end of the article, under Personal Life, was a short paragraph about his interest in symbolism and ancient artifacts.

I shook my head as my group was herded into the museums gift shop. What did he want with the statue? How had he acquired it? And how did he know about the wards? None of it made sense. I wandered through the gift shop idly picking up trinkets and wondering just what to do. Should I warn the docent? The curator? Or did this Scott person know what he was doing.  Were the wards enough? Somehow, I didnt think so.

Are you going to the lecture tonight? Some one asked from behind me.

I swung around, my backpack nearly taking out a postcard stand as I did.

Oh! Sorry, I thought you were someone else. The redheaded girl turned to leave.

What lecture? I asked before she could get away.

The lecture our guide was talking about? I stared at her blankly. Jameson Scotts lecture on the exhibit?

Hes in town?

Yeah, thats what she said, the girl said, flippantly. You should go, hes really hot.

She turned to leave.

Wait- where is the lecture again?

The auditorium in the history building? Building E? She said, as if I should have known. And I guess she wasnt wrong. I was only a few years older than her and I looked like a college student. Apparently everyone thought so.

Thanks! I yelled after her as she walked off with her giggling friend.

I would definitely be there. I had a few things to say to this guy and I wasnt leaving Pennsylvania until I did.

I sat in the back of the auditorium, as was my custom. The room was filled wall to wall with people, faculty and students alike. An empty podium sat in the front and a tall, blonde haired security guard stood to its left. He had a gun on his hip and his hands were folded behind his back. Maybe he wasnt a security guard after all. I was pretty sure state campuses were gun free, which meant he was with somebody important. Jameson Scott, no doubt.

The guard stared straight ahead, his eyes boring a hole into the wall behind me. Lots of things about him made me uneasy.

The murmurs and whispers died down a moment later when a thin, attractive man walked purposefully onto the stage.

Good evening, he began. He graced the room with a smile that couldn't fool me. The emotion didnt quite reach his eyes; if anything he looked like the most stressed out and tired 25 year old I'd ever seen.

My name is Jameson Scott. I am here to speak to you tonight about a few ancient and interesting items I have collected over the years. I'm sorry, but I will not be answering questions about my company, our newest patents or my personal charities."

*Easy, Christian Gray.* I rolled my eyes.

There were a few disappointed groans from the audience but Jameson Scott smiled and directly a flirtatious wink at no one in particular. He was an alarmingly charming man.

"I have been interested in ancient relics, particularly those of religious significance, for many years. Since I was quite young, actually. A somewhat traumatic experience played the catalyst and I've been studying and collecting ever since. I'll begin with some of my more well known pieces and then move on to the more exotic. 

Scott began his lecture on a bowl from Mesopotamia that was supposed to bestow on the user unnaturally long life  as long as you drank from it only water siphoned from the bottom of the Euphrates River. He spoke extensively about several other, equally uninteresting, artifacts before finally coming to the only one I cared about  the statue.

"Please study this photo for a minute." Scott clicked to the next slide in his sideshow and the demon statue appeared against a blood-red background, as imposing and terrifying as it was in real life. A blanket of heavy, uncomfortable air descended on the room as people averted their eyes from the screen and mumbled, uncertainly. I didn't take my eyes off of it.

"This is the piece I spent most of my life trying to locate. May I introduce to you, the demon Metaraxes." He paused for a minute and clicked to the next slide, a Dante-esque depiction of Hell. 

"Metaraxes  belongs to the second hierarchy of demons, though he is virtually unknown  and this is simply because of his nature. Metaraxes doesnt kill or possess. He doesnt vie for power, bring darkness into the hearts of men or try to influence innocence.  Metaraxes eats. But he eats more than the flesh of man, he eats their homes, their histories and their souls. If you were to be eaten by Metaraxes it would be as if youd never existed at all. No one would remember you and the now empty piece of life you had carved out for yourself in the world would fill in as if you were never there. Everything that was you or ever would be you is gone.

Jameson Scott paused artfully to let his words wash over the audience; every soul in the room hanging on every syllable. I suppose it really was quite interesting, if you didnt know the heartbreaking truth of it  which I knew he *did*. For someone hailed as a genius it seemed utterly reckless of him to romanticize all this.  I crossed my arms and slumped lower in my chair. When this was over, one way or another, Jameson Scott and I would be having a conversation. 

And this is why Metaraxes is an unknown. There is no one to speak his name or his deeds, alive or dead. Or there wasnt, for many centuries."

"At some point in history, Metaraxes grew tired of being unknown and un-worshipped. He proclaimed that those who prayed to him and brought him sacrifice would not only be spared and but also given gifts of everlasting youth and resilience  that which he had stolen from others. It is believed that several ancient civilizations took him up on his offer; they sang his songs, built his temples and created beautiful artwork in his likeness - such as the one in your museum - to praise the demon and reap his gifts."

"And this would have gone on for many years until a name was called that refused to be sacrificed. Metaraxes choose his tribute selectively but eventually a name would come up of someone rich or in power and that person would maneuver out of it, or simply commit suicide. In these instances, Metaraxes would grow angry and eat the city and all the people therein, leaving no trace that he, or they, had ever existed. This would have happens many times over the centuries."

Now this was interesting. The creature could be tamed, like a pet, and as long as you gave it the treat it wanted, you would be not only saved but rewarded. 

Something else to consider is that no one ever knew how often Metaraxes called a name. Since the person would be absorbed by the demon, no one would ever remember they had existed at all. It could have been one person a year or five a day and no one would know but the demon himself.

You will find mentions of Metaraxes scattered in religious texts dating back as far as 1700 BC but this statue is rare in that it is the only known likeness of him ever to be found.

Jameson graced the many hands in the air with another tired smile and said, Im sorry but no questions, tonight. If you havent yet had a chance to see the statue of Metaraxes, I encourage you to experience it before it is shipped to New York next month.

Then, without any ceremony at all, Jameson Scott simply walked off stage and the lecture was over.  His security guard, who I realized was more likely a bodyguard, stepped forward to block several girls who jumped the stage to follow his boss. With him busy, I knew I had a chance.

As the throng of people pressed forward to the upper exits, I fell back and went out the rear. I sprinted out of the building and rounded the corner hoping to see what Id gambled was there.

And it was. Jameson Scott was climbing into the back of a white SUV when I spotted him. He glanced in my direction at the sound of his name but then shut the door and rolled down the window as the SUV began to pull away. I threw a Hail Mary.

"Your wards on that demon will never hold!" My voice echoed down the alleyway.

The brake lights came on immediately, but no one exited the car. Taking it as an invitation, I ran up to his window.

For a mere 25 years old, he sure looked like hed seen some shit. His lined, pale, yet attractive face no longer carried a tired look, but a surprised one. I bent over to catch my breath.

He didnt speak, but opened the door and scooted over. I climbed in.

Who may I have the pleasure?

Caitlin Ross, I held out a shaky hand. His surprise seemed to turn to shock.

Caitlin Ross. He said slowly, with a strange inflection of reverence.

Yes, I said, exasperated. Im Caitlin Ross. And your wards  theyre bullshit.

He didnt even bother to ask how Id known, which in turn, bothered me. He simply tapped the seat in front of him and his driver let go of the brake.

Those wards have held for six years, Miss Ross. I assure you, theyll hold.

You have no idea what youre dealing with here.

Oh, I assure you I do. There was a hard, yet sad edge to his voice that suggested  personal tragedy. I wondered if Id misjudged him after all. My apartments are only a block away. Perhaps we should speak more in my study. This isn't a conversation for anyone to overhear.

I noted the finality in his voice and, nodding, sat back in my seat. As long as I got to say what I'd come to say, I didnt care where we went. 

We were let off at the corner where several men in his personal detail were already waiting. Scott escorted me into a private entrance and private elevator with only one button marked Penthouse.

As soon as the elevator doors opened, one of his men ushered me into his cavernous study and the door was shut behind me. For whatever reason, Jameson entered from a different door a few minutes later, followed by his head bodyguard whod been at the lecture. This one didnt like me one bit, barely concealing irritation and shades of panic when he saw me. He was older, clearly over 30, with dark blonde hair and a square jaw.

Jameson sat down behind his desk while I continued to stand. He gestured to an empty seat in front of him, but I shook my head. He gave a suit yourself shrug and turned to his bodyguard, whose eyes continued to bore angry holes through me as they did everything else he looked at. This was quickly becoming enemy territory.

Scotch for me, Bannock. Anything for you, Caitlin?

Ah, no thanks... I mumbled as the guard  Bannock  raked his hair back from his forehead in exasperation, I assumed at Scotts familiar use of my first name. *Im no threat to your boss, buddy, if anything he is a threat to everyone else.*

I returned his icy glare, never wavering until his lips grew into a thin line and he curtly nodded to Jameson and left the room.

First, Scott begin, I want to establish-

Do you have any idea what youre doing? I asked, suspending all platitudes.

Jameson leaned back cautiously in his chair, giving me a casual go-on gesture.

Why would you bring that thing to a populated city? Why would you put it on display for all to see and touch? What sort of arrogance allows you to think that you could control it with a few poorly copied sigils?

He had made no move during my short outburst other than to tent his fingers and stroke his jaw with his thumb.

Which question would you like me to answer first?

Just then the one called Bannock opened the door with a little too much force and brought his great lord and master a scotch. He turned to stand beside Jamesons desk, which seemed a natural and familiar spot for him.

You may go, Eric. Jameson clipped without so much as looking at him. The guard didnt move and I continued to stare daggers at him. We engaged in our own little personal, silent standoff. He, like the statue, had eyes only for me, and they were filled with rage and fire.

He can stay, I ground out, finally. Let him know I'm not afraid of him. If he was grateful for my help, he didnt show it.

As you wish. Your question?

I slid my eyes reluctantly back to Jameson. How did you get it?

I bought it from the government.

The government had it? I asked, incredulously.

The state of Pennsylvania. It appeared on government land, in the middle of nowhere, according to the surveyor who found it. They shipped it off to PSU who dated and appraised it and then they put it up for auction.

They just *sold* it to the highest bidder?

Yes and why not? Its just a piece of granite to them and they needed the money. The state of Pennsylvania is suffering its own financial crisis. Though I suppose thats what happens when in essence 20% of the state just stops paying their taxes. Its a curious thing.

I winced. He didnt need to elaborate.

Why did you buy it? I demanded.

Because I have personal history with Metaraxes. He has taken from me.

Hes taken from me, too, but I'm not parading him around in public, risking peoples lives, their *souls* according to you.

If you listened to my lecture, you would know why I do that.

I remained silent. Jameson sighed and leaned forward.

Youre right, Caitlin. The wards wont hold him, not forever, and we don't know what will. The only reason theyre holding now is because Im *giving* him what he wants.

I scoffed. You assume that being exhibited in a museum satisfies the creatures desire for worship? And you're willing to stake people's lives on that?

"I am. That creature has not moved a millimeter since he came into my care. I've employed teams of symboligists and demonologists to research, test and advise me on the safest course of action. And for our efforts, the statue has remained dormant."

"Yes, but it's not dead. You're going to kill someone, someday."

Jameson sprung up from his desk and was in front of me before I even had a chance to take a step back. His bodyguard took an almost involuntary step toward him but it was too late. Jameson was only inches from me and much more intimidating at eye level. Bannock seemed uneasy and ready to pounce if I tried anything. I didnt.

What would you have me do, Caitlin? Would you like to take custody of it? What would you do with it? Tell me, and I'll consider it."

Destroy it! 

He gave a sad, desperate bark of laughter. Dont you think I tried that? Dont you think the first thing I did when I acquired it was try to kill it? I tried to incinerate it, hit it with a wrecking ball, I even ran it over with a tank. It wont be destroyed by any tools of man. And, believe me, Caitlin, I paid dearly for my attempts,  almost everything I love is gone."

"Then I'd put it back where it came from." If the church was even still there and *if* I could find it.

"No one can do that." He laughed.

"Who did it kill? Who that you loved?" I don't know why I cared so much, but I couldn't let it go. I had to know.

Scott took a step back but held his ground. 

"She was...she..." He trailed off.

And just how did you escape the creature when it came for *you*? 

This question hit him physically,  like a bullet. He leaned back against the desk,  suddenly weaker, defeated and less imposing. Bannock visibly relaxed, his hand sliding off the handle of the gun I hadnt noticed was still holstered in his belt.

That is a story for another time.

"Fine. But I wasnt backing down.  Then why you? Why are you the person who is qualified to own the statue?

Because I've seen it's face. My fate is bound to it as surely as yours.

Jameson Scott rubbed his face in genuine exhaustion. If he hadn't been speaking the truth, than he was a damn good actor. He looked up at me, finally, from hooded eyes that burned with some intense, unnamed emotion.

"And who did it take from you?"

"Jamie." I had nothing to hide and I wouldn't disrespect Jamie by hiding the truth. I raised my chin a little higher and crossed my arms. Scott's expression had turned milder, almost pensive and a sad smile graced his handsome face. The tension in the room abated, though Bannock was looking at me intently, his expression unchanged since the moment he'd walked into the room. 

When Scott didn't reply, I decided it was now or never.

I want to see it.

No," he replied, quietly.

Alone.

No! This time both Jameson and Bannock had spoken at the same time. I'd known he wouldnt let me go - hed never let me near the statue again. Id assumed this before I'd even met him, which is why Id swiped the museum keycard off his desk as soon as Id had the opportunity.

Why not? I asked him, anyway.

Because he knows you.

And you know he could break the wards if he wanted to.

No, he could never get past the wards. They are perfectly drawn and blessed as they should be. But I wont risk your life. Jameson Scott suddenly seemed battle-weary, so much older than his 25 years.

Dont even try it, Caitlin,  he will take you if you do, and the only one who will ever remember you...is me. His plea was multilayered, intricately woven with threads of both deceit and familiarity. Once again, I was put ill at ease. There was only one more thing I wanted from this room.

Who did it take from you and how?  Tell me that and Ill leave Lannenburg in the morning and never come back. It was lie, but I was curious.

Jamesons eyes shifted to mine, perhaps to gauge if I meant what I said. He must have believed me, because his gaze drifted to the window and he answered my question.

I took her from myself. It was an unsatisfying answer.

Now leave, commanded his bodyguard before Id had a chance to reply. Jameson stared at me as I took a step back from the desk. His eyes were again pregnant with an emotion I couldnt name, but it tread a line between longing and insanity.  Perhaps desperate desire, perhaps insane desperation. Perhaps something in between.

I will walk her out. Bannock bit as I made my escape out the door. *God, anyone but him.*

No, I need you here, Andrews will see her out. The door closed behind me and I heard no more.

Andrews turned out to be an older man with a bald head and a white beard. He met me at the elevator and escorted me all the way to the ground floor, saying little.

Do you need a ride somewhere? He asked as we stepped out into the street.

No, I can walk. He said no more, just turned around and let the private door shut behind him.  Nice of him to ask, at least.

As I walked back to the museum, I had time to wonder just what in the hell I was doing. Why didn't I listen to Scott and just leave? What did I hope to gain by seeing that thing again? Couldnt I just trust that he seemed to have everything under control? Scott had the resources, the money, the people, and, most importantly, the motivation. He had lost someone too, after all, someone he loved, though how that had come to pass was not clear. 

But I knew I had to see it again. Perhaps I could prove to him just how dangerous that thing was, regardless of the precautions he was taking. I needed to convince him to take the statue off display before more people died. It was madness, having it here. He was exposing innocent people, to a *demon* on a reckless gamble. If I could make the statue move just an inch or two, maybe even a turn of it's head, it was be on the museum security tapes and I could prove the thing wasn't truly dormant. I read him as a pragmatic, reasonable man - he would remove the exhibit at once. I trusted that much, didn't I? 

Once again I pulled up Jameson Scotts Wikipedia page. All I knew was that he was  a pioneer in the tech industry, rich as a Rothschild and interested in 14th century Judeo-Christian artifacts. It didnt fit. It just didnt. ...unless Jameson Scott was telling the truth.

But even if he being honest about his past, Scott was still lying to me about something. Like everything else in the last week, I would have to trust my gut.

I arrived at the museum and walked around the giant building looking for the gift shop. At that moment I knew two things: the statues room was next to the gift shop  and museums usually had nighttime security.

I slid Jamesons card through the reader next to the door and a light flashed green while the door emitted a soft click. I pushed it open and peered into the empty giftshop. Dim overheard lights gave the room an eerie and foreboding glow. 

The room reminded me of another room from over ten years ago, a nave, darkened by dirty windows and a muted, setting sun. I was younger then, more innocent, and Id had Jamie then.

What I wouldn't give to have him with me, now.  What would he say? Would he trust Scott? Would he attempt to stir the creature for the greater good? Or would he say I was stupid for risking my life? Jameson was convinced the wards would hold. Would Jamie have been, too?

Whatever happened, I hope I didnt fail him.

 I'm working on it right now. 




 Too soon 




 I have all the information you've requested as I've recently returned from a trip there. Update soon. 




 I would bet on it!  




 If you want Batman, get it now. It seems to be the hot item. 




 I wonder what this means for the Sunday Hall H line.

 Actually, [trial by combat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_combat) predates Game of Thrones and has real world historical origins.

Also, the above user was making a Hunger Games reference.  




 My baby goat broke it's neck and I was 18 and home alone and had to put her down myself. It was the most awful thing I've ever done and it haunts me to this day.  




 I you ever feel bad about yourself, just remember that if you were a fictional character people would love you for all the flaws, quirks and mannerisms that you hate. 




 It sounds like no one is currently living there (rusted spoon, perfectly laid out sleeping bags). So there are either bodies for OP to find or something just as bad. 

Keep us updated on the story, this is getting good. 




 Thank you! 




 That was excellent. And mentally scarring. 




 Is this a series?

If not, did the previous owners seal themselves inside a concrete tomb? To what end? 

It more sounds to me like they wanted the (tomb? shelter?) sealed tight so they had a shitty carport that "looked out of place" built over it. 

Explain if I'm wrong, I may have the dumb. 




 Dude... That ending was nauseating yet satisfying.  




 Like /u/wdalphin said, read other stories! Sometimes you'll think of a way better ending to something you're reading and just build from there. 




 There's nothing for it, you just have to write it and post it. Trust me, I know how unnerving it is which is why I only post about half of what I actually write. But you just gotta do it, son.

 




 I wish I could think of something this awesome to get for my dad.

 I heard a kid went blind once from soap poisoning.  




 I think the title has more to do with it than most people realize. When I post I try to pick something short yet provocative. 

 




 I live in Phoenix and this happens a few times every summer. It's heartbreaking.
