 In AskScience and Science we have a lot of flaired users, and we'd like to be able to add them to a private subreddit, right now it's done entirely by hand, which is a real chore if several people have added flair.  

Is there an existing script or bot that would automate the process, like the script that syncs flair between two subreddits?  I'm not a programmer, but it seems like something that should be straight forward to do with PRAW.

 Environmental biology professor at [Fort Lewis College Durango, CO, USA]( http://www.fortlewis.edu), [studying the biological impacts of climate change](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QcIjyzwAAAAJ hl=en).  She studied the biological consequences of earlier snowmelt, climate warming, and most recently elevated CO2.  Her research on how elevated CO2, not just climate warming, leads to a longer growing season was [published in the journal Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature13207.html), and reported in the [news](http://www.nature.com/news/co2-makes-growing-seasons-longer-1.15081), including in a [New York Times column on changing seasons and its consequences](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/science/springing-forward-and-its-consequences.html).  Studies like hers highlight the need to better understand the impacts of environmental changes that happen at the same time.  Her study shows an apparent benefit of greater CO2 concentrations on growing season length that we did not expect based on [an earlier conceptual model on changing seasons] (https://www.sciencemag.org/content/324/5929/886.summary).  Earths biological systems are changing due to human choices, and we need to better understand the impacts, both positive and negative, to reduce the associated risks.

 **Science AMA Series: We helped create the Third National Climate Assessment Report. Ask us anything!**

This past Tuesday, May 6, the White House released the Third U.S. National Climate Assessment - the most comprehensive national effort to assess the science and effects of climate change in the U.S. The report is designed to help officials, businesses, and members of the public in all regions and sectors of the country make the best decisions when dealing with climate change and managing related risk. The NCA also illustrates how these regions and sectors are connected. Unlike previous assessments, this NCA has been released as an interactive website, nca2014.globalchange.gov, to make it more accessible and useful to both citizens and scientists.

We are researchers at the University of Arizona who played a significant role in both the overall report leadership and especially the Southwest and Forestry chapters. We will be answering questions starting at 2PM EST. 

Who is here:
Kathy Jacobs - Recently returned to the University of Arizona to lead the UAs Center for Climate Adaptation Science and Solutions after serving as the Director of the National Climate Assessment for the White House.

Gregg Garfin - Lead author of the Southwest chapter of the NCA and Professor in the UAs School of Natural Resources and the Environment


Dave Breshears - Lead author on the Forests chapter of the NCA, drawing on his expertise on drought-related tree die-off, and Professor in the UAs School of Natural Resources and the Environment


Dan Ferguson - Director of the Climate Assessment for the Southwest 


Thomas McDonald - Project and Events Coordinator at the University of Arizonas Institute of the Environment, helping us navigate Reddit and input our answers.


tl;dr - The White House released the third National Climate Assessment(NCA) on Tuesday. It is comprehensive, designed to help everyone make decisions to deal with climate change, and released as an interactive website, a first for the Feds. The just-returned-from-the-White-House former director of the NCA, Kathy Jacobs, and a number of contributors, all from the University of Arizona, will be here starting at 2PM EST, 5/9/14 to answer your questions.

 Prof. Richard Betts, Climate scientist and Lead author of the most recent IPCC report is doing an AMA in /r/science today.  Please stop by with any questions about the IPCC or climate science!

Here is a link to the AMA:

- Browser: Chrome

- Cookies Enabled: true
- Platform: Mac
- Did you search /r/RESIssues before submitting this: yes.

This gave me a good fright until I figured it out, for some reason, and this is something that not many would notice, in subs with many user flairs, if you have RES enabled the "Next" button to see the next page of user flair is gone.  This gives the impression that the user flair has been deleted, but it's still there.  

If you disable RES and reload the "Next" button appears and you can go through the list.

 ##**Science Verified User Program**

/r/science has a a system of verifying accounts for commenting, enabling trained scientists, doctors and engineers to make credible comments in /r/science . The intent of this program is to enable the general public to distinguish between an educated opinion and a random comment without a background related to the topic. 


#**What flair is available?**

All of the standard science disciplines would be represented, matching those in the sidebar.
However, to better inform the public, the level of education is displayed in the flair too. For example, a Professor of biology is tagged as such (Professor- Biology), while a graduate student of biology is tagged as "Grad Student-Biology." Nurses would be tagged differently than doctors, etc...

The general format is:

Level of education|Field|Speciality or Subfield (optional)

When applying for a flair, please inform us on what you want it to say.

#**How does one obtain flair?**


First, have a college degree or higher in a field that has flair available.
Then send proof to the mods of /r/science .

This can be provided several ways:

1) Message the mods with information that establishes your claim, this can be a photo of your diploma or course registration, a business card, a verifiable email address, or some other identification. All submissions will be kept in confidence and not released to the public under any circumstances. You can submit an imgur link and then delete it after verification. 

Remember, that within the proof, you must tie your account name to the information in the picture.


2) if you aren't comfortable messaging the mods with identifying information, you can directly message any individual mod and supply the information to them. Again, your information will be held in confidence.


3) Send an email with your information to sciencereddit@gmail.com after messaging the mods to inform them of this option. Your email will then be deleted after verification, leaving no record. 

This is convenient if you want to take a photo of your identification and email from a smart phone, for example.

Edit:  Hi.  We're getting flooded with requests, we're adding people as fast as we can, if we miss you somehow, we apologize, if you don't see your flair or get a response in the next two days, message us again.

Thanks for making /r/science a better place!

 Ebola has been in the news a lot lately, but the recent news of a case of it in Dallas has alarmed many people.  

The short version is:  Everything will be fine, healthcare systems in the USA are more than capable of dealing with Ebola, there is no threat to the public.

That being said, after discussions with the verified users of /r/science, we would like to open up to questions about Ebola and infectious diseases.

**Please consider donations to [Doctors Without Borders](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/our-work/medical-issues/ebola?utm_source=google utm_medium=ppc utm_term=brand_sitelink) to help fight Ebola, it is a serious humanitarian crisis that is drastically underfunded.** (Yes, I donated.)

Here is the ebola fact sheet from the World Health Organization: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/

Post your questions for knowledgeable medical doctors and biologists to answer.

 We're looking for a practical way to judge Panelist activity in /r/AskScience, and a good way would be to generate a log like the moderation log but tracking flaired users.  We don't care so much what they've posted, but rather how much Panelists post, so a simple tabulation of the poster and the number of comments would be fine.

Seems like it would be straight forward, but I've learned that simple things sometimes aren't so simple, so it makes sense to ask more experienced people first!
