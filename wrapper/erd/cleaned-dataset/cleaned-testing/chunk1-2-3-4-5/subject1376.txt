 That would be pretty awesome. I'll look into it as soon as I've made my way through the MASSIVE amount of books still left to add.

Also if anyone knows how to quickly do it chime in as I'm sure it will be a while before I get to it, though I do want to get to it.

 Do this:
Restart everything and flush your cache by opening terminal and type dscacheutil -flushcache
That should take care of your troubles. And if not, I'm so sorry, because iOS 5 is amazing.

Make sure you flush everything with itunes closed. After that reopen and it should all work.

 For reproduction you are probably best going with something like blurb or lulu. Here is an example of an artbook project I just finished with a bunch of other artists. Granted this one was all digital work submitted to me in an approved template, but you can see the final pdf's, images of the printed work from blurb and how it is setup for sale (no profits are made on this).

 I like how grumpy the viewer looks in the 5th picture down. 





























 I'm not the best at getting my thoughts written down. I thought I made the point that if you have been designing for a while it is part of the natural progression of things, or at least it seems that way for me.

A huge portion of my job recently when developing apps or websites is the UX end of things, and it naturally lead to choosing to do that full time as opposed to just doing it along with developing the UI and actually building it all (html, javascript, Xcode etc).

If your job already has you doing these things, and you enjoy that end of it, then you should consider doing it full time as it is a good way to step into a higher position and make more money. I should have been more clear on that point. I didn't mean to come across as saying you should do UX only for the money, as in my experience that is one of the last reasons to do work. I think I actually had an entire section about doing work you enjoy but my friend who read through the article told my I had too many tangents :) 




 Sorry I've been in the digital end of design for so long now I just assume everyone knows what it is :)

Part of my new years resolution is to "not be such a shitty writer" and I suppose part of that is not making assumptions about the audience. It actually took me most of the day to write this. I didn't know getting my thoughts out on 'paper' was so difficult.

 You're right, what was I thinking :( 














 I went from an Intuos3 to a cintiq and I'm happy with the switch. The intuos is a bit faster and more responsive, but I only have a 21UX. I imagine the new 24hd and 24hd touch are better.

I still love drawing on the screen more than on the intuos, but as you said the price jump is pretty significant.

 I can understand wanting to read all the comments at once like you're used to. From a writing standpoint it's nice because I get to see what part of the writing people are commenting about. 

Here is an example from this article. I had a sentence that made no sense and the comment system allowed me to see exactly what the commenter was writing about.

 It isn't legal but by the time the developer gets a cease and desist from Nintendo they will hopefully have made some money from ads and collected a lot of user data. To comply with the cease and desist they will just change the offending art and the game will keep its users after the update.  




 That's a wonderful testament to patience, something I am constantly trying to improve.  




 I agree with qwert in that it would be great to see more contrast, especially at the end where something is illuminating the way forward. It's a well done piece composition wise.

 This looks like a fun subreddit. How do you request an invite for private subreddits? I hope it is an involved process requiring animal sacrifice. 




 It sounds like you have already made up your mind to use this opportunity to pursue new work. As you develop more as a designer you'll find that money isn't the only motivator anymore. It's great when you find a place to work that has a great culture and shares the same values as you. Keep that in mind on your job hunt, though I also understand that sometimes it can be so bad that anywhere else is better than where you are :)  




 This is beautiful.  




 I think the only rules in advertising are that you can't tell an outright lie. Otherwise advertisers can pump out whatever paying consumers are willing to be influenced by. All religions advertise, some are just better about using the right sort of media to reach an audience.

My assumption, based on no research what-so-ever, is that a large part of football loving american families are christian to some degree. It is probably easier to convince someone who believes in one religion to switch if they are 'losing faith', than it is to convince someone who has no belief system to suddenly get one. 




 You have opened an entirely new world to me :O 




 Oh cool thanks I'll check this out. 




 I think [this tool](https://www.hotdoor.com/cadtools) has an isometric grid but I didn't want to pay several hundred dollars for it. 




 I've never worked with blends, googling now thanks :)

 I've been working in it for a long time now, but there are some quirks that drive me bonkers. Snapping is a big one. Nothing EVER snaps correctly in illustrator. Whether that is because I am not using settings correctly (enable pixel grid, snap to point, snap to grid, sub snap settings like snap to selection or snap to art board omg) or Illustrator has just had awful snap detection I do not know. I suspect it is just illustrator trying to make me angry.

Regardless of some of the crazy things about Illustrator it really is a powerful piece of software and allows me (and other much more talented artists) to do really neat work.

There are an almost unlimited amount of free tutorials out there on youtube and artists' websites for you to learn. I just recently read Vector Basic Training by Von Glitschka and it was excellent. It has a lot of basic stuff in it and he does a good job of explaining how and why he does certain things. 




 I use so many keys I actually got a 2nd bluetooth keyboard that I use on [top of my wacoms](http://instagram.com/p/ZWDCftlPBs).

I had a medium intuos I just recently sold because I found I was using my small one (in addition to the cintiq) and never the medium one. I had bought the small one at first to work while traveling and found that it was really all I needed. I think I may tend to draw small anyway in my moleskines though, so it really is a preference thing I think.

The nice thing about most retailers now is they take returns on hardware for at least 7 days, and in some cases (like amazon) up to a month after purchase. Try one out and if you don't like it swap it for a different one. 




 I've had great luck from americasprinter throughout the years. If you want high quality (higher cost) papers and letterpress check out dolcepress.com 




 This is good advice. Go out into the real world to conventions, meetups etc. You will make valuable connections who will have advice and possibly work for you. Social networking is great but it still doesn't compare to meatspace networking. 




 Wacom recently rebranded the bamboo to intuos, and the intuos to intuos pro. When the bamboo first came out it had driver issues and was very unresponsive and I couldn't recommend it to anyone. I have not tried the newer versions but they may be much better. If you have less than $100 you may want to try one of those. Maybe get one on amazon and if you don't like it send it back.

If you have $250 to spend the small intuos pro is amazing. I have a 24" cintiq touch I use every day and I still use my small intuos pro several times a week. The intuos is super responsive and has almost no lag (compared to my cintiq which has some lag when I'm doing quick sketches.) If my intuos were to break I would immediately get another one. 




 Every couple of months I find a unique style in something that catches my eye, whether it's a form of illustration, design style, painting style etc, and I copy the style incorporating my own content into it. I don't ever do it for clients or for money, it is mostly just to learn and practice something new (or something I haven't done in a while.)

An example right now is isometric pixel art. I actually have a client that wants this form of illustration for a project, and I have done it before, but I'm out of practice. Right now I plan on doing a few illustrations just for personal practice before jumping fully into the project.

I like browsing behance and dribbble for styles that I have no clue how to do, and I try to copy it as closely as possible. After I feel like I have a better understanding of the style I then try to make my own content in the same style.

It's not really a design challenge that other people ever see, it's more just for myself, but it works well for me :)

 When my wife had our new baby the hospital we used had a birthing center there, so if something did go wrong it was a room away from doctors with lots of equipment and tools. We didn't look into any other birthing centers so I'm not sure how many of them differ or if they aren't part of a hospital. 









 I've never seen your stuff before. I really like it all :) How do you make time to do comics if you have a kid though :( 




 I actually came here to post that line:

"2.	We shouldve noticed that the photo used in the blog wasnt up to par. It just wasnt a good shot, and there are about 5,000 others wouldve been better suited for the post. "

Sounds like someone is upset they got caught stealing an artists work. If I did have any sympathy for the blog who is making ad money on articles using parts of other peoples work, it vanished at that point. 




 You won't be living out of your car if you don't focus on interaction, though it would probably make you more marketable. There are a lot of companies that still need good print designers (I just finished up a contract for a large trade show company) and the work is fun and rewarding. When I have tough decisions like this to make I tend to lean toward the one that I would enjoy more and it has served me well in life. 
























 This post on flexbox taught me almost everything. It is a very well explained article with excellent visual examples.

 Adobe is trying some neat things with edge animate. 




 I agree in that this is something I would do as well, however I can respect someone for creating something useful to keep them focused and immersed in their work and sharing it. I can never learn that lesson. For example, here I am on reddit again instead of finishing the last 25% of that mindmap I've been putting off. 




 All of tech feels that way for everyone eventually. Before the internet we used to animate stuff in [Macromedia Director](http://www.amazon.com/Macromedia-Director-Dummies-Computer-Tech/dp/0764502247) because every serious business gave out presentation CD's at trade shows. Then the internet came around and prodigy wasn't fast enough for 600 megabyte movie files, which is seriously all the space you are ever going to need my 17-year-old self from the past is trying to remind me.

I don't know what existed before Director. Probably the solitary madness of nothing.

 As an app developer myself I'm still sad more companies don't do companion apps, or at least make some API's so we can put stuff out.

 Don't be. It is in line with my sense of humor :) 




 When you are in a production environment with a full workload production  details. When you aren't in that environment the details matter. If it appears that you don't care about the details it appears that you don't care about the quality of the work.

In this case (the graphic_design subreddit) the details should matter.

 I've read git isn't really the best for [binary files](https://robinwinslow.co.uk/2013/06/11/dont-ever-commit-binary-files-to-git/). If you're looking for something more for backing up your work check out [extended version history](https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/113) in dropbox. Other services like google drive might have something similar though I haven't looked. 




 If you're interested in animating read up on [SMIL](http://www.w3.org/TR/SMIL3/smil-animation.html#animationNS-AnimationModel) 




 Here is some light reading for those sleepless nights http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/ 









 I can see how it's misleading now thanks, I think I updated the article in a way that makes my intentions more clear. 




 A good place for me (and many designers) to start is by tinkering with the code that makes the stuff run. You can [play with the examples in the article on codepen](http://codepen.io/ryanallen/pen/OPpbbR) without making an account or spending time setting up a dev environment.
 




 Yeah view it here: http://codepen.io/ryanallen/pen/OPpbbR

Ironically enough, the medium.com publishing platform doesn't support .svg files at this time (or embedding codepens), the animation at the top is actually a gif :) 














 What are your pros and cons with polymer so far? I've been anticipating playing with it. 



















 The way I learned how to do it was by drawing curved shapes in a vector drawing program (sketch, illustrator etc) and exporting to SVG to take the code apart. 

After that I began reading the w3 spec recencyeffect posted to learn all the hidden goodies.  




 It's for a section in a larger piece for a web based project. The entire piece will be [animated](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/animate.html) in code.  I never thought I would do pixel art in a vector program until recently, though I believe hexels is vector based but I haven't used it in a while.  




 I suppose I formed a bad habit early and never thought to do it any differently. I'm glad I finally took the time though :) 




 What is the most frustrating thing about working with IE8? 




 I have never had a reason to use more than one background image until now. I fear there are thousands of small things like this I'll never have a need to know.

 Trade Dev time for whichever current hobby consumes the most of your time. If you play video games for a few hours everynight try spending that time on your portfolio during the week and "cheating" on the weekends when you can resume the hobby for a nice break.  




 You just blew my mind as well. 









 Wow, that's amazing. I have a lot of polishing left to do on my current animations apparently. 




 Maybe try making the gradient greyscale and then applying a lumosity blending mode to it http://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/transparency-blending-modes.html#about_blending_modes 




 Think of it as the opportunity to do an art project in a week. Make a website advertising your favorite super hero's services. 




 I'm not sure what you're asking. Do you want advice on how to create more things for a portfolio? So you want critiques on what you've already done?
