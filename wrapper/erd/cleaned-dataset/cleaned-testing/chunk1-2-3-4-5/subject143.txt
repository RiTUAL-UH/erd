 Yeah not like he moved his stick to place his hip fire reticle perfectly on the guy or anything, sure it added a tiny adjustment but not exactly game breaking stuff.

 Your laugh is contagious  




 You are actually informed when you are spotted, you hear a small sound to notify you that you've been spotted just throwing that in there. Obviously it's easy to miss it with all the explosions and gun fire though so.

 #THANKYOU 




 Ellie what have I told you! 




 Source? 




 Ah that's too bad, was looking to play a nice DT rush server :-( 




 Tried clicking the link for your server, says page doesn't exist? 




 It's interesting  
























 Thank you I'll have to do a bit if reading about it see if it's something I'd be interested in  




 I've thought about the army but I'm sure my girlfriend and parents would kill me before I joined hahaha but I am going to look into it, as an engineer in the army how long do you get deployed for if at all?  




 Thanks i'll have a look into some of your suggestions, also i'm in the UK so i don't think that codeacademy is much use to me here. 

 




 Basically i'm in a foundation year of an engineering course at the moment and i'm really, really struggling with all the maths and i'm dying to do some practical work and actually learn something, all this maths just seems like it's a waste of time and leading to nowhere, i feel like i'm probably going to fail this course, but the thing is i really enjoy the idea of engineering, fixing things particularly, is there a course out there that judges you based on practicals rather than maths tests?

I've thought about apprenticeships and gaining experience through work but i have no idea where to start, i'm young and have never had a job, but i really want this to work also i'm in the UK so if you can point me in the right direction on where to start looking that would be fantastic, i just feel all a bit lost at the moment.

Thank you in advance. 




 One more and it would be a dugtrio 




 This is just wrong man, why does that even exist, you have to be pretty messed up to make a subreddit like that... 




 Thank you i appreciate your advice, i think it's more her decision than mine but i'll be there for her either way, thanks this is making me feel alot better about how i can help her out and what she'll be going through. 




 Yeah i don't particularly like the fact that we have to do this but being young and still in university it would not be good for us or the child to be brought up in a situation where we have no time to look after it, and i will support her no matter her decision if she chooses to keep it, i will discuss it with her and if she still feels like she can't go through with it, i'll be there for her, and thank you for your out look and opinion it's nice to have another point of view :-) 




 Thank you, i'll remember that for next time. 




 Ah i didn't notice that i'll remember that for next time, and i've looked and don't think i can edit in a serious tag, lets just hope the people of reddit are respectful! 




 Thank you so much for sharing your experience, i'll show her this tomorrow and hopefully give her some peace of mind, i know it's going to be hard for her and i'm going to be there every step of the way with her, this is defenitly what we want we've spent alot of time thinking about it together, and yeah her family would go crazy if they knew about it and she doesn't need that extra stress, thank you again i'll show her this tomorrow (she doesn't use reddit) but she might PM you from my account if that's alright and again thank you so much!  




 Sorry it's my first time posting, not really sure how to add it? 




 Genghis the war monger can he kill it, Genghis the war monger yes he Khan!
