 Watched a doc of a family using a pot with an iron upside down, with a pot of water on top of the iron to heat bath water (along with 2 coffee pots and misc other things).
 




 Gel medium? I thought they used mod podge for this, can I use hair gel? 




 If it means a lot to you - adtr
Stay out - hit the lights
Siren - the dangerous summer
Just stay - strange bacation
The space between, and probably a lot of other songs by Valencia
A lot of Brighten songs
Thing left to lose - transit 




 Hell yeah. Used to love this band but forgot about them. 




 Not my type but you'll do fine on a dating site. Pictures are fine. GO FOR IT 




 Yes! Saving this post. I know they'll say omega 3 and vitamin b rich food but curious for further input.

Side note: gluten makes me very depressed. 




 This is so intriguing and scary. Does he sound smart or like he knows algorithms? Heard he had an IQ of 110. Handwritting? 




 seriously, is it really that hard to just fuck Amanda ahhaha 




 Gonna start using this instead of Go Fuck Yourself. 




 I didn't pick up on her intentionally wanting a baby. The scene with Derek's sister is made me think she wanted to leave her family and move in with another family, like Derek's or something. But the theory here makes more sense for the show. Fuck, I hope not though. 




 So much always happens in an episode, I feel I have to comment while watching the episode to actually convey everything I want to say... But that's not going to happen.

Love Lip's stuff still, I really don't think they're going to get him caught in some way like the others... Unless this is the last season - interesting way to end the show for good is if they put everyone in jail or suicide. I think it's becoming more clear that his storyline will be to enter the professional world and succeed, even if his luck pisses viewers off

Definitely want to kill Sammi. At the same time, I thought she was going to kill herself after she told Ian he was great and going to be okay. Her, Ian, and Charlie could all be in the running for a suicide ending, hopefully not. I think there's going to be a crazy season finale of a very smart death brought upon by Mickey and Fiona, maybe the rest of the Gallagher squad as well.... BUT at the same time, like Lip said last episode, Carl going to jail was inevitable at some point, and Ian getting caught is as well. It was something they were responsible for, Sammi just bridged the gaps I guess.

Don't get Debbie pregnant. Don't. Urghh. Still, I do like the relationship and don't think having sex was wrong for her. Yes, she'd still young, but at least it's in a caring, healthy relationship, plus they seem to be best friends which is most important (i think) during teen sex.

Fucking Fiona, okay, the kiss was in a specific context but just... be a prude for an episode or something.

Hate commenting on Frank but he's so in love, even if it's a friend kinda love. This makes me upset, but happy at the same time. I think the doctor dies at the end of the season, showing that Frank can experience heartbreak and sadness -- I don't think she'll be cured or they'll call her with a fake positive or anything like that. 




 No question she's going to die. I bet it'll be in the finale, a long, smart plan by Mickey, Fiona, maybe even Frank and Lip. It's gonna be good. 




 a guy putting his dick in your vagina and thrusting, then cumming. then you both leave. 




 still have it?  




 aside from pills, eating right, exercise, melatonin, not laying around in bed or the room where you sleep, keeping TV and the phone away for a couple hours before bed, and try youtube meditation or night time sleep videos with soothing sounds.

This is easier said than done, I tend to just take various pills (ambien, a benzo, otc sleep aids, melatonin, and tylonel pm/nyquil). 




 Lol really cheap. Like $0.25/milligram. 




 Broke and friendless. 




 Don't really have a favorite band anymore. I mean, there are a few bands I like but I know they're nothing groundbreaking and their music isn't anything to move mountains. Haven't been to a show in forever either.... 




 Walls. So they could talk and move and kill people. 




 and assembly line. 




 and cotton gin. 




 Yes. The light bulb. 




 Well that's no good. 




 Why! I feel that'd be perfect 




 Okay I'll probably take the adderal tomorrow and hit the gym then write my paper ;) 




 What is your normal day like? How do you handle weather and physical strain/lethargy? 




 Really interesting thread, the comments completely show the opinions of the males and the feelings of the females. Emotionally, as a girl that's been through this, i would be upset too because I tend to have the "I need it all" mentality with guys and friends, and I can't always get over a hook up if it's not someone I met that night, and have to face as a friend/acquaintance. I know it's bad and not right to do it to him, but it's just my emotions.  Now on the practical side, I would love to say I can move forward and he should not feel bad about my interpretation and doesn't need to apologize. 

I think it's best to both remain practical and show hints of remorse for not being on the same page, as well as learning that girls are weird and emotional. 




 My goal is half bakery half community room--music, art classes, craft shows, etc. Midwest is a little far though 




 amen 




 Well, I don't know really. I think that's you're part, you have to get creative. Services don't really require much capital versus producing goods. Haven't you ever heard of the red paperclip trade? Maybe get certified in a trade, like software, design, etc and begin in that way. Good luck. I really say this because I fee the same way and really don't think working for someone is right for me and can't seem to find a company and position that I will work well with. I want to live my life combining all the things I love and be my own leader, I don't know how far working for a company will take me as far as natural fulfillment. I plan on (hopefully) opening my own food business, then expanding to greater things.

Where do you live? I could use a partner... 




 Be your own boss. Create a business, create things, help create. Travel. 




 It depends. Sometimes I'm in the room I grew up in for 15ish years or in a wide open area like a barn without any furniture. I never seem to be in multiple locations in the dream though, it doesn't change settings. Usually I'm alone or with one other person, although I have had a couple where I was with strangers.. When I say strangers I literally mean people I cannot recognize, have no idea what there name is and feel like I have never even met them in passing in my life. 

No. They feel like they last FOREVER which is terrible because most of them really scare me and I feel I'm trapped. ill fall asleep and then wake up after and see my clock only said 1/2 hour has passed. Feels more like 12 hours in the dream. 




 do you have any ties to St. Pete, Florida?  




 So do you like... Wanna be friends.. Or... Uh..
 




 Both sound right up my alley. Much appreciated. 




 I think i read this but will try again, thank your 




 Thank you. A lot of titles listed are books I've heard but never seemed to get around to. 




 Really? I've heard of it but figured it's script only. I'll search it.

You use it? 




 I just don't understand or believe in meditation. Isn't meditation just relaxing and trying to clear the mind for a while. I've tried that, I've done some YouTube videos, just doesn't seem like something that could change my life for more than half an hour. I don't know. 




 Yes! Just reserved both. Should be good. 




 If you're not covered in flour, you're not a real chef.

Or may it's the opposite. 




 Well well well, this is a great question and discussion. I have my popcorn ready. 




 Judging an animal competition for Legos. 




 See you there 




 You can't take out a loan? What about shadowing someone?

Seems like you're doing well and happy (to an extent). Good for you. Waiting wouldn't be terrible... 




 Yeah I love that little area in Snyder 




 I'd talk with them and learn if they have the same mannerisms and emotions as we do. 




 A weird feeling when you have what you think is a great idea and there are already a few similarities within the area. It's like discovering America only to find it was already discovered. 




 a tomato because i'm controversial and kinda sweet. 




 Just create a station on Spotify and you'll get all the related bands that are popular in the genre right now. I also really like Major League. 




 Probably french fries with mayo and ketchup. I could eat them for every meal, every day. Plus, there are so many different varieties and cuts of potato! 




 I love fiber one cereal so I understand what you're talking about. I think bars or those cookies would be the death of me so I don't eat them. I'd keep them out of your cupboard because they might end up harming you. Drink a lot of water though. I also know that if you always eat a lot of fiber, your body gets used to it and you stop shitting so much.

are you eating less and feel more full in general? if so, it's probably good that you're getting extra fiber. just cut back a little bit.

I love chips like corn chips or tortilla chips with salsa. I also have a very unhealthy obsession with bagels and french fries! Gotta cut those out completely. 




 Grab generic food from aldis or save a lot of something like that. Maybe a bag of chips for every 2 people. Cook something, like a homemade dip or brownies. Invite people to bring something if they'd like or plan on making smores in the microwave or something silly... like a taco party, or a nacho party.

games like cards against humanity, charades, apples to apples are cool. and of course drinking games like have you ever, truth or dare, etc. are fun (even if you're not drinking). 




 if you like pop punk:
transit, the story so far, state champs 




 I don't mean to be offensive or anything when I say this, but it feels like you're mentally retarded. At the same time, it makes me feel like I'm the world's biggest philosopher. You have short trains of thought. You will go through a phase of intense laughter and feel your eyes squish together.

Then I usually nap. 




 I'venever heard of that in my life.

I make amazing stromboli though. 




 Intriguing! Can you do a quick run down of what Ayahuasca is and what it's able to do? I feel I read about this once and someone posted it was the worst thing they're ever done but holds great power. 




 Stop trying to force something that isn't there. He's not the one, but a significant person in your life you should keep around. 




 Okay, I get what youre saying. I wouldn't market it as "art therapy" and i doubt we would get to the point with real therapists and correct procedure, etc. Art classes, yes, that is more correct. 




 I feel a lot of people have mixed feelings on indian dishes, which tend to be mostly vegetarian. Not sure about that. I want to stay away from pasta because I feel it's so hard to get right. The sauces are something I take very seriously as an Italian-American. 




 Yes and no. Maybe I should say Art AS therapy in this case. I was thinking more out loud and probably should have tweeked my wording before posting. My idea is simply to make art, do artistic things, get people engaged, give them something to do, maybe learn a new skill. I'm an art therapy minor and have friends within the program that teach classes that do not call it art therapy but hold the general idea over the classes they offer -- like shrines, mandala work, etc.

Writing this quickly on almost a dead battery so apologies for grammar and what not! 




 I haven't had this account for 2 months, yet I've gotten 2 months of Reddit Gold so far. I see no perks about it. If there was a better tradeoff, I probably would do it. It'd just me a symbol for our connection, this time and place, who I am and who you are. 




 whoa, that one is firey! Thanks for the knowledge! 




 Checked briefly his history and did a search that didn't show up with anything. Wasn't until now that I checked the universal block page and even though i scrolled down alphabetically, I did not scroll down ALL the way and see his name. Also now found more dirt on him. Filed a claim with Paypal and hope to get my money back. 




 Sports hold more meaning than... I don't even have an example what girls talk about because all I hear is blah blah blah. 

I'm a female btw. 
























 I think there's like 7 seasons... 




 My mind is blown. 




 construction, delivery men (food and furniture, etc), coutbound/inbound call center or telemarketing. sell drugs, underwear, flip free stuff you see on the side of the road for money, or thrift store flipping /r/flipping 




 I like answering questions too. I love posting here but don't get many questions. How do you relieve stress/anxiety? 




 3. 




 Mturk 




 Fourth wall? 




 Meds. They have me a little clearer view, enabling me to kind of "self help" myself how a therapist may.... If that makes sense.

Hated therapy. 




 3 




 I was obsessed with coffee, stopped drinking it when I started antidepressants and other pills. Sucked but now I don't drink it at all. Maybe once a month. 




 And your favorite? Love(d) opiates. 




 Depression, anxiety, mania. Low social interaction, body issues, abuse, drug use, alcohol use... All at the same time. 




 Not sure if feasible but my high school sells mattresses for their football team. Big profit compared to candy bars. 




 Just cut it out. You can do it and won't miss it.

Healthy eating works too (so I hear). 




 Already on ambien. Tryna get more blown 




 Humans are so unique! Sometimes killers become monsters in our heads . 




 Browse reddit. Search for threads about the zodiac killer. I did that the other day and was so intrigued. I just took an ambien trying to get freaky, I hope I can make it past the drowsiness and join you. I've been up since 4am. 




 Yes. It did result in a relationship which I guess I can't be mad at. He showed me different things and took me on the ride of my life thus far, even though we never really "dated."

Gut feelings hold a lot of importance. 




 I'm very sorry for the deaths in your family. It's hard but what a blessing to have had them in your life, to make it more beautiful.

It's reddit, time to spill how you messed up. I've been through a lot and I'm not one for preaching, but I do enjoy telling others my experiences and how I look at different situations. 




 No that's rude as fuck and weird. Seems like she's using you and you're better than that. Sorry. Just an outsiders view. 




 At least you can feel feelings. Even when I'm ecstatic, I'm not "high." 

Ask her out and be a 27 mature kind gentleman and get some ice cream in the park over homemade sandwiches and a picnic basket. 




 Happy birthday, very exciting but be careful. Welcome to the 21 club, friend. You made it 21 years ;) 




 Brand new-dj entendu
The dangerous summer - reach for the sun
Lydia-illuminate 




 You're in your 30s and live right in the middle of white collar and blue collar. You probably have one kid that you want to be a rock star. And a gotee 




 You smoke weed but don't do much more, yet you live a respectable life as a productive human being and are empathetic and compassionate to others.  




 Veggie burgers. 




 Do you have a dog? Take them to a class or day care and after, talk with the teacher or whatever and ask them to teach you.  




 College isn't worth it but having a degree is.

Learning is worth it. 




 Work hard and be nice to people.

My old boss (who was more like a parental figure) used to tell me "everyone has their problems." Not really advice but impactful. 




 Stolen money/gift cards. 




 Find Steve jobs and tell him to make the iphone 10. 




 If you told him a dark secret or something that is heartbreaking to you or difficult, would he try and comfort you and give a damn?  




 No just do khakis and the polo. Or dress pants with a fun print and cardigan. 




 Probably when someone dies.  




 Clients, equipment, a plan of action.

What are you going to do for the dogs and in what time period? Costs? How are you going to promote? How will you "transfer" the dogs? Things like cutting nails have serious health implications and should be learned by a professional prior. 




 Me too. so much for my one moment of wit for the day :( 




 Probably Jim Kelly or a famous sport coach. 




 That there are so many weird hobbies and obsessions I never heard of, and that there are people with the same sense of humor as me out there.. Oh and people are actually willing to share information and help if you ask. 




 Not unless it's something I may return or a big ticket item. You never know, but food and stuff like that, NOPE.  




 Bleachers-I wanna get better 




 The wonder years whole album called "the upsides." 




 Any update? I can't keep track of new posts here. 




 Want to date? 




 I probably have like $1 floating around on that site. I think there's a sub for it... /r/mturk ? 




 A few things as a manager for a quick service place (and of course past worker):

Don't let this get you down. Yes, it's mcdonalds but everyone has their struggles and although you may not feel anyone else will hire you, they will. You have something to bring to the table, whether you know it or isn't visible yet.

You supervisor shouldn't make you feel angry or upset. It's his job to LEAD you. Leadership is about bringing out the best in people and helping them towards their goals and growing.

If you're not happy, I'd say quit. I know this isn't always possible because of financial situations but sometimes you just have to go with your gut.

Also, I kind of skimmed this post, but I hope you realize there will always be hardships in life and in a career and need to be able to cope and reorganize yourself to work through these issues. 




 75% off hotels. 




 I thought that too and considered eating it again. I don't think that's why I'm depressed though, although diet is probably one of my main problems. I bet this is more of a humorous post, but if anyone has articles on depression and meat/non meat eaters, send them my way. 




 A few other bands posted a video like this, I think they covered a Brand New song, maybe TBS. Anyone remember this or can link me? 




 Not sure what that means.. 




 I don't eat meat so I'm probably not the best person to ask. What dish is served with these options? Chicken is probably the healthiest, and if I ate meat, I'd only eat chicken or turkey. Lean meat, great protein, plus all the chickens in the world are only alive due to human breeding for dietary purposes, so if you're worried about what is humane, don't worry -- we already ruined the species and I don't think they can become extinct anymore. 




 My friends 2 year old sibling. So funny. 




 No but I'll eat anything at any time. 




 Likewise. 




 To put story behind the post, I want to get away from my problems, not talk about them. 




 Or experience any real happiness. 




 It's a coverup for my inability to connect/learn/make friends with depth... I guess 




 Namaste 




 No I do not know how to relax, that's my problem. Why relax when you could be doing something productive? HOWEVER, there is nothing that matters more in the world than happiness, making memories and connections, and learning from others. IMO at least. 




 She really is a great human. Need to read Amy's autobiography next. 




 Never been near a tornado, what are you guys doing? Where do you go? 




 No but Tina Fey's bossypants made me feel feelings. 




 Stuff from home, your own business. Maybe housekeeping, paperwork, secretary 




 Message me to talk, I'm on mobile and it's difficult but can help. 




 But I can't cut it out of my diet =( 




 Statue of Liberty too. 
























 take a few hundred then turn it in. 




 Female? Khakis, black pants, or black jeans. Nice dress shirt or tank with a cardigan. Be friendly and treat it like a conversation with a friend. You'll be find. 




 Intelligence - 8.5

physical - 6

sexual abilities - 9 




 Take her to grab a coffee or ice cream before the party. Best of both worlds. 




 Yes, of course ask her! If you like her enough to post this, then do it! Don't text her. At least call her. Or text her to plan a skype date then ask her. If you want to spend a little bit, send flowers with a note. Or, just make the drive. 90 minutes isn't too far.

Just do it! 




 I can't answer this for you because it's all your feelings. forget about the girl moving or her sleeping around. Now which would you prefer? You said you're in love with number 1, remember?

Go with your gut. 




 Yes. Funny in a sarcastic, friendly or witty manner is very appealing. The kind of funny where you make fun of other people, are obnoxious, or make poop jokes is not attractive and quite annoying.

BUT, be yourself. Don't try and become a comedian, just be you. 




 Yes, they can most likely refer you to some type of counseling.

Just tell them how you feel and all your symptoms. What helps is to write a list beforehand so they know everything. That's pretty much it. I recommend a psychiatrist over your regular family doctor though. If you're still in college, they usually have free counseling and a psychiatrist on hand for your convenience.  




 A form of coping. Plus plenty of meterial. You look at the world differently because your brain lists things of importance differently. Making people laugh for me is one of the things that gives me self confidence and being sarcastic and witty is a way to stay sane for me, if that makes any sense.  




 He looks just like beckham to me.  




 No 




 A really bad paper cut wound. 




 Riding gave me sore thighs for like 3 days. Once I woke up with pretty bad scratches on my legs in all different areas, I think from a bunk bed. And of course bruised knees, which is a horrible cliche.

Man I miss rowdy sex.  




 I think this is the winner here. 




 French fries and mayo 




 All mom and pop, nonchains. I don't understand why people go unless you're out of town and unsure.  




 Interesting question. I'd have to do some calculations and see what tools were provided for me. I think $400,000 may be acceptable for the client and myself. 




 If she is actively trying to work on herself and an adult, then no, I'd let her try therapy and be just there for her. Talk to her first, say you want to say something to her parents and think she needs more help BEFORE making a big move. 




 Um, probably just a guy that can be my friend. When you're a friend, you give a fuck about them and can also shoot the shit with. 




 ask your neighbor. if he hassles, tell him you'll buy him mcdonalds.
Or craigslist.
Or call the local news for help. Or a radio station. Or yik yak.
Or be like the girl from that one college that said she would carry around a mattress until her rapist got expelled, which then led to multiple people carrying the mattress FOR her for weeks. 




 you sound like a fun friend. Your girlfriend as well. Keep it up. 




 was he gay? 




 I thought bets like this were just stupid jokes and nobody followed through, mostly because we all forget about it 5 minutes later. It sounds like you wanted it...

But seriously, I don't really find this a big deal. Is that bad? 




 I'd say keep a job and get a degree in something first (if you don't already). In the meantime, expand your horizons. Say "yes" more to people inviting you to do new things, take up a hobby, read something you find interesting. Then make a list of things you like to do. Not like "taking people's temperatures" but more of your character traits and what eases you/excites you. Discover who you are by what gives you internal pleasure or drive. 




 Maybe you should talk with someone to get past that. There's one thing to be naturally introverted, but this seems like something that's holding you back from greater things. I'm really sorry this happened to you. 




 Sex and killing people... but not in that order. 




 vegetables... what's really great is homemade veggie chips or fries. Basically just roast stuff in chip or dry form and pretend it's a junk food. carrots, zucchini, kale, turnips, etc 




 relaxing or not multitasking. I always need something to do, to work towards. huge perfectionist.

other than that, I cannot stand dishes in the sink!! 




 as fast as my heartbeat. 




 bossypants - tina fey 




 Eat fast food you have back home. Rob a bank, rape, stone a woman. Insult our military. Use racial slurs.

But other than that you can do anything. If you're asking what major sites are overrated and not worth your time, start a new thread. 




 One I love is I Wanna Get Better by Bleachers.

Gym class Heroes/Travie McCoy have a few but I can't remember the titles now.

Otherwise by Macklemore 




 Same At my schools. If your parent didn't call in the morning, you got a phone call home by an administrator, or if it was high school, you got a recorded message saying you weren't in.  




 I always just stayed home. once I went to a hockey game though. I wish I would have forged more early dismissal/late arrival notes though. I went to school far too often.

College is another story.  




 Until you get addicted.  




 I was going to post something similar but I didn't want reddit to judge me because I judge a guy by their looks. 




 Depends how it's done and by whom. If he doesn't cat call or say "yo mami", I think, "wow! I'm not that ugly! At least one part of me is nice!"

Other than that I just get uncomfortable and scared.  




 Don't be late or shy. Know when you can work.

I was like 10 minutes late and didn't plan my other jobs schedule to tell them my availability and fucked it up. 

Oh, and dress nice. 




 Shameless! Best show on tv.  




 Were you at a party or with other friends? If so, get them to hang out again and make sure she comes. From there, get her number. If it works well at the get together, ask her there if shed like to get coffee or a drink. 

Pretend Facebook never existed and it's 1985. 




 Yes of course. Did you think it's like the CEO or manager of something? If so, wear a pants suit. Other than that, wear a cardigan, nice shirt, and slacks. That works for most jobs. 




 Panty selling probably 




 Not surprised one bit. 




 Probably either be engaged or married. With a career. Would be pretty down on myself if I was without either. Definitely moved out as well.

As far as activities, I'd like to get my car inspected by myself. Travel oversees again. Volunteer in a different country. Rock climb! 




 No you can never please everyone, whether it be the countries people or other countries. However, like the other comment, Switzerland is inching there and I think Amsterdam is doing well. 




 Just like every day- wake up and say "today im going to be great!" Take a hot shower and grab a coffee and remain optimistic. Find something to look forward to! Like next weekend of an amazing dinner you're going to cook when you get out of work. It may sound cliche but you if you tell yourself you're going to have a good day, you'll start believing it. 




 i looked in here before watching but idc, she's dead?!/ yess! 




 I would have thought he meant standards. Like it's easier than you think.  




 tell me about the teachers lounge and any gossip about the teachers. 




 This is absolutely insane to me. I know people in NY that have their masters in teaching and can barely get a subbing job.  




 what site posts the quickest? I need to get to bed early tonight but want to watch ASAP. 




 Yeah I always need to be working. Just got 2 jobs for 60 hours a week. Because the job schedule, I still have afternoons free and I'm off all day Tuesday and I hate it. It's actually a problem, I always feel bored or lazy. 




 I think I had a mental breakdown in my lifetime, yes. But tonight (slightly dramatic) I have not. Hanging in there  




 I'm hoping my new jobs get me to slim down because I'm phat 




 Woohoo! I miss those early days, like my first 5 times having sex. Lots of nostalgia for that point in my life. I had sex last week and it felt like a daily routine, like brushing my teeth. *sigh*

Watching the walking dead tonight? 




 How old are you?

How many girls have you had vanginal sex with?

How do you handle sex? Like, do you just assume to not thrust so far in or what? I don't have a penis so that may be a stupid question.

Oh, and where do you live? I'm interested.... 




 Damn... 




 I love Belgium! I want to go back right now.
 




 What's the word, baby bird? 




 Literally everything. 




 I don't buy cheap canned foods there. I make sure if I buy canned food, I try and find low or no added sodium and/or sugar, possibly organic, brands which aren't normally carried by these stores.

I'll buy store brand names for pretty much anything. Mom says stick to popular brands for cleaning supplies.  




 Working in food service. Cooking, walking, serving, carrying stock. Plus you get paid! 




 Hahaha I've gotten similar. 




 Cholesterol and eggs.
Fat being "bad." 




 I personally believe in it. I know stuff is probably staged and cut to look and sound different but overall, I feel she is legit.

I might be in the minority here. 
























 I'm so excited for you! I wish someone would ask me out. If you're east coast, your have two hours. Will expect an update. 




 It's just how you view it. Embrace the whitey in yourself and all will flourish. 




 Fuck that. I praise the sun and take in all it's rays. 




 Thank you for this post because now I know what I'm going to make for dinner!!!

The answer is.......


French toast!
Wanna come over? 




 I've become a little more apathetic. I think this has to do with my ability to get 3.0 GPA (minimum) without trying AT ALL. I'm very good at playing the system, and my college is not hard in general. So, I really don't care about walking out of class or skipping or giving a fuck about what I wear, how people perceive me, how many friends I have on campus, etc. If i feel it's not worth my time, i won't show up. If I think a professor is ridiculous I won't show up or I'll let my voice be heard. I guess this is part of adulthood and synonymous with independence.

Also, I learned it's okay to think outside the box and your opinions actually ARE what professors want to hear. I've been lucky to take a handful of classes with professors that let you (and expect you) to be free with your thought. Some of the things I wrote seem like I'm high out of my mind, but it's really just me digging deeper and making connections that I've been forced to not look into in other classes. 




 I'll spin it tomorrow 




 I've been Into exploration as well and started metal detecting. Great way to see the outdoors and float around to new places/hidden gems in your area. 




 It's PEMDAS. Parentheses, exponent, multiplication or division (left to right), addition or subtraction (left to right). 




 The answer is 6. Parentheses first, then division and multiplication left to right.
2*3=6 




 Have you talked to your doctor about antidepressants? They often help with anxiety all together, rather than a quick fix like xanax. Same with your focus, really will help on a low dose.

I've been on my share of antidepressants that have changed my levels of anxiety. I've found when I'm on a pill that completely removes anxiety, I am unproductive and boring. Anxiety kind of forces me to multitask and complete things fully and quickly. I manage every little detail which is why I do so well, esp at jobs.
 




 Yeah I just got off from work and headed to some more spots today. Got too messy in my work clothes and shoes so headed home. Going big tomorrow on my day off though!! 




 I am definitely getting better each time I dig a plug! Luckily where I've been has either been my own property or land that's otherwise not well kept so I can hide my mistakes for now! 




 $loan $150.00 




 Thanks for the welcoming. Went out today for 2.5 hours, multiple place. just kept finding beer can and rocks! and 11c! I will not be discouraged, heading to the beach tomorrow! 




 Having trouble, can send you something via paypal if you have one.

 Yup. End of thread. 




 Been there. Look at /r/opiatesrecovery 
If you can't do it alone colt turkey, try lupe or kratom. If that doesn't work, get suboxone from a sub clinic.. Of course rehab is a possibility.

Get yourself to a counselor as well because issues aren't just on the surface.

You'll be good, stay positive. 




 It 100% pays off being nice! I will go out of my way for any nice guest and do it with a great attitude. For a complaining guest, I'll try my best to make you happy because its my job! And, I love the feeling of turning a rude customer to a nice grateful customer. I usually will not be overly nice though. And next time I won't be as happy as I could be.

physical contact is necessary. Plus, helen keller could get by, so can  i! 




 I've had mine dismantled and can reassure you.... it is. 




 I will dismantle your heart. 




 ARE YOU VOLUNTEERING YOURSELF AS TRIBUNE? 




 That's awesome. Artificial sweeteners have a similar effect on the GI system.

I want to try a chip. 




 Omg your answers are in sync with my brain. This is a hard breakup but I support your decision. 




 This is down the road from me. Always makes me smile when social media posts it around. 




 Chelsea smile.. 




 Oh and do you want to be my boyfriend?  




 Did you tell her what you told us? 




 What is your name? I feel like I dated you... (See below) 




 I want to live as minimally as possible but feel like this is a big step moving out. Thanks for the encouragement though. 




 taco bell veggie cantina bowl. my stomach right now... send help... 




 Worked for me once. I didn't really care either way though and my boss was a great pal. 




 it's like soured milk chunks 




 Canada's fries-- fries, gravy, cheese curds. 




 definitely recommend yak and yeti! WOuldn't go to Be out Guest. Just mediocre. 




 Ya I graduate in less than a month. Freaking out but trying to remain optimistic and stand my ground. Focus on right now, rather than finding a career for the rest of my life.

As far as motivation, maybe you'd like to talk to a doctor about getting on a mild antidepressant. I don't think you're necessarily depressed but rather in a rut going through an existential crisis. 




 Because I'd want to save it to make pinky promises.

And if want my left ring finger for marriage. 




 Probably a pinky on one finger and the ring finger on the other.

So 200k. 




 I think you new to do some soul searching. Explore, spend time alone, spend time with strangers, travel, take up new hobbies or volunteer. After this, Make a list of your positive traits and what you find you like or value. 

If you don't have a job, get one even if it's not a "career" and work hard at it to make you feel confident. Plus it takes time away from dwelling on your problems and puts your energy into something else other than anxiety.

Think about your "virgin" situation. Do you want to have sex for yourself or because you think it's what you NEED to do (just like you NEED to get a job out of college)? If it's the former, go right ahead and pursue that but know it's not going to solve any problems.

Other than that, someone once told me to not worry about what you're going to do to create happiness for the rest of your life but rather focus on what makes you happy in your current life. (I probably and wording this wrong) 

Good luck I've been there and overcome some of the problems that you've mentioned but still right there with you on others. 
 




 Whole situation is stupid. Don't pay her and ignore this train wreck of a person. 




 The song I don't mind. The intro video is what kills me. It's so long and pretty old now. They should just have a scene at the bar as an intro or something. 




 exercise. That's all I got. 




 amazing. As I graduate with a B.S. in Business Admin, I'm realizing I am more intrigued with a career along the lines of social work. Any advice? Are there any entry level positions you think I'd be qualified for without any social work background right now? Or, any similar career paths you think would suit someone interested in helping people, dealing with children and human science? 




 Yes, that's why we keep having sex. 

Gotta cut him out soon. 




 I'm a girl and would probably do it but not get into a relationship. It's his choice and I'm not the only one to blame. 




 No this sounds weird as hell. Not normal, tell her to stop. 




 Probably cost efficiency.

I actually live near next to 6 and think 7 is also a great place to live if you like heat.

You can get a job where I live as a waiter anywhere. 1600E is $2000+ America? That'd get you a pretty good apartment here with at least $500 spending money. But this obv changes by location in the US. I'd say the average where I like is $1000USD, so maybe 800E.

Up north, you don't really feel the racism. Down South, it's a little different. I wouldn't really say it's that racist or segregated, but people do have different views than what us in the North view difference races. What you hear about shootings happen, but no, it's not like that. There's rape and mugging but it's not something we should be known for. Inner cities you'll find more or it.

Don't live in Compton or NYC.

 




 No. My mom used to be just like yours and when I was too young to go to the bathroom myself, I remember her putting enough TP to clog the toilet on the rim of the seat. Now I just squat depending on the cleanliness. Most of the time if it looks clean and well maintained, I just sit right down. I don't care.

Once a year I put a cover on just to reminisce about my childhood and because they look fun. 




 Thanks for posting, you're giving me a lot of courage. Italy seems much more doable than the other places I listed. Sounds like a challenge planning and going alone but I'm certainly going to look into it.

 He's probably the happiest guy I ever met, never once yelled and just so helpful and friendly overall. I for want to let him down or disobey him because he deserves respect and doesn't need my hassles or bullshit.  




 I just grab coffee in my car. 




 Spray poopouri or another perfume/febreeze in the toilet before you go and flush. 




 Sounds like you have an anxiety disorder. Maybe talking it out with someone, even a friend, will help. 




 Probably testosterone and ability to build muscle easier. 




 Why don't you ask the people you're living with how they feel? Id rather have the 3bdrm but I'm not living there. 




 Kinda just want to get high and converse. 




 It's much, much more acceptable than calling guys "boys." Just a synonym for me. I don't have a problem with it. 




 Wow this is extremely interesting. If I go to my psychiatrist and ask for your script, what do you think would happen? Would I need to do a tap? We've tried 3 antidepressants and I'm not doing great, I wonder if he'd give it a try. 




 Girl. I can be a grill if you're into that shit, oh yeah bb 




 You probably don't want to hear this but I 100% think it should be required to go to a community college for 1 or 2 years and take some gen eds right out of high school, then transfer. It saves money and gets you focused, both with the college atmosphere and your future wants and needs. If you wanna be away, you can always get an apartment, rent out a room near a college and be on your own. 




 Lmao thanks that's the one 
























 Offer to do something she wants. or a fetish.
only fair. 




 I'd rather share my opinion about the multitude of threads talking about the banning of FPH.
 




 Yes, 100%. My depression was based on not knowing how to communicate, cope, express myself, because of my upbringing. And other things of course (genetics, imbalance). But yes, that's why I started to use. Some others here may say they didn't start because of this, but continued to use because of depression. Slippery slope. Fuck depression.

Edit: opiates have been 10x better for my depression than SSRIs/SNRIs. 




 This happens all the time. They just changed the packaging. One is newer than the other. 




 12 steps 




 Left my penis in the car, one of them melted slightly. 




 fuck her 




 To rebuild again and learn from this. To realize the compassion and similarities in others. To try and find the "highs" in life. To meet me.  




 I had one, and we fell in love. Now we don't talk and really would like someone that is in the same boat as me. They should have a depression dating site. 




 Yes, there is more risk vaginally, but I would of course make them wear condoms, which obv is still risky (this whole situation isn't ever going to happen), but does cut down. I honestly feel BJs are more personal and I would be able to have sex with a gross guy but I probably would not be able to give a gross guy a BJ. 




 Doesn't matter either way, imo. I think you're safe with just the shirt. 




 I'm F and yeah, it's a turn on because it means he's going to eat me out which is literally the best thing in the entire WORLDDDD. 




 I don't even understand what your job or company is... 




 come on down im broke 




 $300 vag  sex, $600 BJ. 




 Well black is sleek but who cares? I like the white too.  




 Good for you, not just for realizing you have a problem, but for getting your wife involved and putting things on the table.  




 Well, it affects every single aspect of my life. It'd take me a day to write it out and there are multiple people that have already written articles/blogs on their own experiences. 

What are the biggest things for me (at the moment) have been school. I can't concentrate, I don't care about getting good grades, I don't go to class b/c I can't get out of bed, I feel sick when I get a bad grade or don't know something, I feel alone in the classroom, or i won't be able to complete a class so then i start thinking about my future and how i won't graduate because i can't complete the coursework, so i won't get a job, won't get a house, be broke, no one will want to marry me, can't provide for family, friends hate me, etc, the list goes and on and on it goes.

Then there's work. I can't get out of bed or bathe, so fuck it, I'll call in. Then I'll realize I should just quit because my brain says I'm useless. Hard to remain interested in a job or give a fuck or no get angry at the littlest things. then you start worrying about money without a job and then the wild thoughts run through your head like stated above.

And then socially - I feel like laying in bed all day, in pjs, unshowered. I don't want to talk to anyone. I see people doing things, having fun, excelling at work, and it makes me feel bad about myself. I think I'm useless or boring or a pain for others, a burden, etc.

This was based on depression, but there's also problems with anxiety and mania that are pretty much the same things. 




 shia labeouf, jennifer aniston, Fat Amy, Leonardo Decaprio, Florence and the Machine... 




 wow. Just wow.


wow. 




 Draw Lucille Ball on top of a pogo stick, hopping on the stomach of a 400 lb man with an afro that is simultaneously playing the violin. 




 Um, probably people believing in me, telling me i'm talented, "the best", interesting, funny, etc. Encouraging me to make something of my life, I like those people and their energy.  




 Please don't tell me I'm not depressed because I'm not acting the same way you were when depressed. Ye, I'm clinically depressed and have been since my diagnosis 1.5 years ago. I'm both bored and disinterested in my job, because I'm bored and disinterested with every component in my life. I feel no joy or interest in anything and this is certainly not y first time taking a mental health day. 




 this is really hot, actually. 




 Oxford, England. 




 THERE WILL NEVER BE ONE.

Seriously, I was you 6 months ago. Taking opiates because it was the only thing that worked. Some people get depressed and suicidal because of the pills, I was depressed and took the pills to stop the depression. It got out of control and I had to stop. Now I'm on antidepressants that barely help. They suck. Opiates are much better but I'm constantly debating if it's worth the risk. 

Kratom is legal and similar to opiates for me, in terms of motivation and interest. 




 Tell him and make your life YOUR life.  




 WOW! I've been researching ECT because meds just don't seem to be helping. What's your timeline look like as far as first med tried and last? I've gone through prozac, cymbalta, lexapro, and then wellbutrin and another one I can't remember. Getting discouraged, I hate going to my doctor and having to tell him "Nope, still want to die." I hope he doesn't give up on me or get frustrated. 




 Oh my god, so many feels. 




 I've been meaning to check that out, thanks for the reminder. 




 Education systems. 




 Depends. I mean, I don't eat meat so if someone asks for a recommendation like that, I usually state what others have told me and the reputation. I used to work at a juice bar, and when it wasn't ferociously busy, 90% of the time I had an in depth conversation, explaining everything, giving them recommendations. That was my favorite part of my job!

At the end of the day, though, we all have different tastes. I could like one restaurants type of sauce, and you may hate it, but we both like spaghetti sauce. So, it's hard. But to answer your question directly, no, it's not annoying to me AT ALL. I love it. I think a lot of bartenders are like this too!

I'm sure some people hate it, however, and these people are probably those that hate their job, menu, or products.

 favorite nut?
 




 baggy jeans. You don't have to wear skinny, tight jeans, but wear something that fits your body. Also, sneakers are something that bother me. Obviously, you can wear sneakers, but theres a certain type that screams "grandpa" or "dad" that creeps me out. 




 Construction or enter a trade. Work somewhere with room to grow, ex hotel. Take a career aptitude test.

Why don't you like your jobs? Rather than saying they suck, think of the specifics, and then generalize them. For example, I found I can't handle a job/company that doesn't allow creative freedom. 




 Thanks. A lot of information here. I should post in this sub more often because you're all terribly helpful.

I'll start by looking at my manuel. There's nothing specific I want to know, I just feel stupid when a guy pops the good to take a look, and I would have no idea where to start. 




 Original borrow of $150, pay $55 for 3 installments. Great borrower, very honest and trustworthy. Fully paid on time! 




 I'm a female but don't know anything. I could probably change a tire but I want to know what connects to what, what parts look like, etc. I feel there should be a minimum that we put men able to fix, but I think that should go for everyone. 




 Too much attention, feels like I'm showing off and the center of the universe which I don't like. Preconceived expectations about how you're SUPPOSED to celebrate, but never do anything exciting. And dislike of another year passing (usually in relation to feelings about not being successful/in a good place vs. what you think you should be at that age).

 pineapple upside down cake!!!! 




 Go on a site that switches letters around in a word or phrase to make a new word or phrase with the same letter. I can't remember what they're called right now... 




 Awesome! That's is exactly what I'm looking for! 




 Clitoris and your tounge. Kissing.  




 All parties need to get off before you leave 




 Honestly, if you like her is suggest waiting until dating. Things might get funny with sex, it happened to me.

Trim up decently. Make sure you're clean. Then start kissing her. Eventually feel and caress her then fuck her. Also, if you get off quick and then button up, you will be a dick if she got no enjoyment out of it. If you care about her, you'd get her off too.

I despise guys that leave after they cum after 2 minutes. Nothing more disrespectful. 




 Call people up for sex 




 This is why I've never visited old teachers.. 




 Nerve, Heavy Gloom, and How you are.

They all blend in and as of right now, they all sound SO similar. However, it's a really great album to listen to while doing something. Really pumped up and enjoyable. 




 Thank you!! I applied for the open nccc's open! 




 I want to do something similar, have a business degree though. What's your official job title and can others get in like you? 




 Stories of reddit stepping in and saving lives. There's been a few, one I remember about a runaway abused wife.

In a most shocking post, someone posted a video of a guy being decapitated and sliced all over, all his limbs off and then just beating the shit out of him. Really gruesome. 




 Are the nccc'a the 10 month, full paid rooming thing I was looking at? 




 Close you eyes and pucker up for a kiss. Now you know that answer. 




 Love and be loved. Be free and help others gain strength. 




 vagina, butt, mouth. we got this under control. 




 I haven't worked in a market but have worked at a place that does samples. The worst is people that just want something free and pick it up and keep walking. Or anyone that seems as if they're definitely not going to buy anything. If you take a sample, expect to stay for 30 seconds and let me tell you about the product. If you want to try all of them because you want to try something new and potentially buy, I have no problems with you. 




 We're on the right track! I'll do something like this. 




 Ill probably just text him to fuck the shit out of me.

And yeah, I guess people do t user stand my question ? 




 human life - happiness, fulfillment
human race - simultaneously finding happiness while embracing others and helping them on their quest for happiness 




 Probably not 




 Mierda is shit? Wasn't that girl from tangled named mierda?
