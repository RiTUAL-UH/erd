 You made state without a reverse? How could you do an 11 dive meet? 





























 If your at university in California I would check through your school. I know that lots of California schools are very water sports oriented. I would be surprised if your school didn't have a team. 




 Ohh I see. I learned my reverses by after my hurdle when I jump of the board I make sure to take my arms up to my ears and slightly arch my back to start and throw my body into the reverse direction. You will get it eventually! Everything takees practice! 
























 I really don't know too much you can do because I believe it does partially have to do with hand size. However there's hope that maybe your practice balls are a bit worn. Our team sets aside 3 balls that are top notch and only designated for games, so maybe that'll help your cause. Also maybe just work on some ball handling skills in practice. For instance not picking the ball up on top, or maybe turning your hand during your pump fakes to so it wont fall out. 




 The main goal is to ride the board up. I used to throw my dives early and hard and ya I would get around because it was fast but my height would suffer. Give it a strong push and don't throw for your dive until the board is finished pushing you up. It's hard to get the timing but after a while with someone watching you you'll get the hang of it. 
























 Can anyone help me out with an invite? 




 Advertise it within other waterpolo fourms, websites, outlets? I personally would enjoy this sub to grow to what it deserves. 
























 If its a technique problem make sure you are correctly using your arms in your approach. Also make sure you are bending your knees enough and riding the board up making sure you get enough height up. If all else fails, leg workouts like squats, lunges, etc. will help you with height. 




 Pick her or your friend because that's what it'll end up being.
