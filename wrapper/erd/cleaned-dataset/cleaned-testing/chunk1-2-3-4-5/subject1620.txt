 Of course, exercise without proper hydration, diet, and rest can definitely exacerbate a migraine 




 Hey everyone,

I've never visited this subreddit before but my family actually suggested I post something online about how I was able to overcome my migraines of 10+ years. I'm not a great writer so bear with me.

A little information about me, I am a 22 y.o male and recent college graduate. I've been suffering with migraines since the 4th grade, and while I was in High School was diagnosed with "chronic, severe migraines" by a neurologist. I have seen a few different neurologists and between ages 17-21 was prescribed between 50-200mg of Topamax daily for prevention, and various triptans (both oral and injected) for treatment of pain. The past 1.5 years I have not taken any form of migraine medication, preventative or pain relieving.

After 10+ years of migraines I have largely been able to figure out my triggers:

1. Dehydration has always been the biggest one, and also easy to figure out since I played a lot of sports in school i.e. I didn't drink enough water at soccer practice I was puking and thumping myself over the head with a soccer ball to try to get the pain to stop.
2. Changes in the weather, mainly when it gets cold. If I spend too long outside in the cold without covering my head with a warm hat I will surely get a migraine.
3. Food and blood sugar. Not in the sense that I have dietary triggers but if I go to long without eating I can get a migraine.
4. The most PAINFUL trigger for me though has always been alcohol, and as an American college student and a member of Greek-life not being able to drink can put a huge hamper on your social life. Alcohol-induced migraines gave me an entirely different breed of migraine, completely untreatable except by emptying the entire contents of my stomach multiple times over and passing out for 10-12 hours.

Here is how I've been able to remove the prescribed medications from my life and live a fun and generally unrestricted lifestyle (including alcohol use) even though migraines are always something I worry about in the back of my mind:

1. Proper exercise: I lift weights 3x a week and run between 3-5 miles 3x a week. I cannot overstate the importance of a constant regimen of exercise. Both as a preventative and spot-treatment. If I am suffering from a non-alcohol related migraine, a quick run or gym session is sure to take the pain away.
2. Hydration: I drink at least 70-80 oz of water per day, and much more if I know I'm going to be consuming alcohol.
3. Food: 3 square meals per day, and a meal or large snack before consuming alcohol is crucial.

I know what I've said might seem like very typical advice, but when I adhered to it, it totally changed my life. I went from the constant looming fear of that unfathomable, nail-through-the-head pain, to confident and generally care-free. Of course it's hard to get migraines out of your life 100% of the time, shit happens as they say, but my life has transformed for the best.

Hope this helps at least one other person the way it has helped me.

 
























 Sure, here's some info:

I've always been on the thin side, when I first stared what resembled a workout routine I was a mere 5'11, 145lbs. Within the last year I have been in between 160-170lbs.

I was underweight for my age as well. Maintaining a good diet i.e. eating enough calories to maintain your level exercise and staying hydrated are critical for proper exercise. Without food   water exercise would, for me at least, just make my migraines worse.

My goals for exercise had nothing to do with migraines actually, I just wanted to put on some muscle before heading off to college. It took finding a good balance of cardio and weight lifting before (3 days of each I mentioned) while eating enough and drinking enough water before my migraines dwindled off. I imagine that if I had migraine elimination as a goal of exercise and the information I have now, they would've gone away sooner.

I will also mention that when I say "proper diet", I just mean eating enough to keep up with the calories you're burning in the gym and still gain muscle. I don't count calories or nutrients or anything like that, although I'm sure healthy eating would only help more.   




 I remember constantly being pushed more and more medication at the neurologist and doctor's visits when I was younger.... funny how the simplest things seem to work the best 
























 Definitely this 




 Getting used to drinking a lot of water can definitely suck. Just try to force yourself to drink more. I'm not talking about over-hydrating or anything crazy, but the more often you drink water the easier it gets to maintain good hydration levels.

Also you will pee a lot. 
























 Yeah heat does it for me too, but drinking all that water makes it easier to stave off. 




 I totally understand that. Life happens, and big events definitely make it hard to maintain a regimen 
























 a good fitness regimen came to me more through trial and error rather than a prescribed routine. I would have made sure to stay fed, hydrated, and incorporate more cardio. cannot emphasize enough how much that combination has worked 




 I get red wine headaches from cheap reds, and sometimes good malbecs and a few others. I believe that these are Red Wine Headaches and not specifically the same type of headache as my migraines because they happen regardless of how I prepare for drinking. Seems safe to assume that people who suffer from migraines would be more susceptible to RWHs.

For me, overly processed alcohol like cheap beer and cheap spirits are worse culprits, but I believe it's the alcohol itself rather than the other ingredients
