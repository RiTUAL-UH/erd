 Who is your favorite character in any show and why is it Oberyn Martell? 




 No problem man! I agree with your thoughts on the "lack of realisation" by peers. I always feel like I'm the only one actually contemplating this stuff whilst everyone else is caught up in things like religion as you say. I am not trying to offend religion or say that God does not exist in any way but I feel like a lot of people get scared of stuff like this and religion or the idea of a God is an easy solution. You've gone the hard route by truly contemplating one of the scariest things which is the mere meaning of existence. It is not at all irrational to have this anxiety. I think curiosity and contemplation of the universe should take form in awe and excitement rather than anxiety. Just because its uncomprehending doesn't necessarily mean its scary or a bad thing :) 




 Yeah! It's when you think to yourself "I'm really tired I'm just gonna have a quick lie down" that you always end up napping. I mean I never lie down whilst tired and then after 5 minutes go "Okay, thats that done!" I always end up waking up 2 hours later feeling like death. 

This thread actually reminded me that when I got my first panic attacks when I was younger it was always during/after naps. I would go in this kind of delirious/ sleepwalking state and walk around the house saying really weird stuff like "where am I?" to my family whilst crying. They would try and calm me down then I would wake up later having no recollection of it. 

I guess napping wasn't built for everyone! Anyway I actually think its a good thing because it makes you more productive. One of my friends naps all the time and never gets anything done, also makes him stay up later at night procrastinating. Its good to have a stable sleep cycle.  




 bro! I have the exact same thing. After watching that video with the new picture of amdromeda where it slowly zooms in i felt like i was gonna have a panic attack. It seriously puts everything into perspective making u feel extremely insignificant yet at the same time significant by your mere existence. I also find it funny because most people on this subreddit have things like social anxiety or health anxiety yet I also have this like existential anxiety, its usually worse at night when you're lying in bed just questioning everything. It is literally the most terrifying thing when you truly sit down and try and comprehend your own existence and existence of anything in general. Even typing this now I'm beginning to feel a bit weird.

HOWEVER. At the same time its fucking awesome that we are all in this crazy boat together. I mean in the complete and utterly incomprehensible face of it all, we still get up every day and go about our business and try and lead meaningful lives. 

The way I look at it is that you are not an insignificant thing INSIDE the universe but you literally ARE the universe contemplating itself. You are this big badass scary thing, that is you! 


I'm literally going on a tangent here just getting excited about all this crazy stuff :) One last thing though, I seriously recommend you listen/watch some Alan Watts videos. He is like a psychiatrist for all existential induced anxiety. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I -Thats a good one. 

:) hope u feel better 




 Dude! Every time I nap I literally wake up in physical pain. I get so jealous of my friends who always can take naps but I literally can't. I wake up feeling like I've been in a coma or been knocked out, I have no idea where I am, my teeth feel horrific and even if i brush them they still feel weird like they are covered in sugar and i get a pounding headache.It literally will make me feel bad for the rest of the day until I actually go to sleep. fuck naps bro! 




 That was way sadder than I was expecting :( Is there no like ending to the book? I feel like all the stuff with the mice was just dropped.  




 Whats wrong with the 5th book? 




 I am about to finish the fourth book in the hitchhikers series. While I loved the first few I feel like they have gotten progressively worse. I feel like nothing even happens in the fourth book. Is it worth reading the fifth? What are everyone else thoughts? 




 If you could have one thing now that would make you happier, what would it be? 




 You look like Christopher Nolan. 




 This truly made me feel the significance of that quote about whether or not we are alone are both equally terrifying. I mean after looking at that picture how can you say we are alone? That is one glimpse of one speck in the universe and it seems utterly and unfathomably gigantic. Yet at the same time, the thought that even amongst the sheer size of the universe, we are alone makes me feel like I could explode from incomprehension. I am one of 7 billion. 7 billion. That number is so small in the grand scheme of things that it practically does not exist. Trillions of stars and billions of galaxies. I actually exist. I am one of the 7 billion and I am proud to be part of the 7 billion. 
























 Sorry for the late response! I loved Korea. Soeul is so much fun. I'm really into hip hop and it has some really cool clubs that just play rap music. Food was amazing, people were nice and I really wanna go back! I flew with Korean air which is a really nice airline.  




 i just flew to korea on a 12 hour flight! Okay so if the anxiety is about plane crashes, there is utterly no reason to be afraid. Even taking into account the plane crashes of 2014, the odds of your plane crashing are unfathomably low, they aren't even worth considering. Flying is literally one of the safest modes of transport compared to driving etc. Also, long haul flights are always in big juggernaught planes that dont take no shit from heavy turbulence. literally feels like ur just in a room for 12 hours.  




 You need to have more confidence in yourself man! Nothing bad is going to happen. For all you know she is more nervous having invited you over.  




 Fuck the king! 




 So would you recommend I just don't read it and accept the ending of Adam's version? 




 Okay so I have two questions. Was it the Vogons or the Grebulons who destroyed the earth? I don't understand which did it. In the wiki here http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Mostly_Harmless it says  "Earth is destroyed by the Grebulon commander." But I thought it was the vogon using the new guide to destroy every possible iteration of the earth?

Second question, is it worth reading and "And Another Thing..." or is it not considered part of the series because its not written by Adams?

Thanks! 




 holy shit man... That was really well put! The analogy of the butterflies and the garden. Makes me really want to focus on myself and feel happy. 




 Thanks for the response, you kinda changed my perspective. I guess I do get so caught up in seeing all these happy couples that I forget the other side of the coin. I will try to focus on being happy regardless of my circumstances :) 




 Don't really know where else to post this so I thought id just write about it here for therepeuatic reasons. So yesterday was valentines day and I went out with my sister and her friends. Whilst out I couldn't help looking at couples and feeling so envious. I am 19 and I've never really had a serious girlfriend. I feel like being in a relationship is a huge aspect of life that i simply haven't experienced yet. I'm not socially awkward or anything. I just feel I've never really built a relationship with girls that I know. Tonight I decided to go to a coffee shop and get a coffee and read my book to relax but I'm literally just sitting here feeling utterly lonely. On the way over here I kept walking past restraunt windows and seeing happy couples eating and it literally just makes me feel like I want that so much. The whole situation reminds me of that George rr Martin quote about how being lonely at a party hurts so much.

Anyways I just wanted to write this because I feel writing makes me feel better. Have a great night.  




 I'm the same. I sometimes convince myself i have diseases because diseases always happen to the unwary and unexpecting. If I believe i have the disease then the chances of me actually having the disease are lowered. I especially say this about stds. I'm crazy 




 Haha dude I'm the exact same. The left side of my head always throbs and feels like there is pressure building up inside but I've had cat scans and everything and it's fine. My neck is also riddled with lumps, my glands are always swollen, I have a lump on one of my testicles etc... I've had it all scanned and it's fine but my body is literally proof that it's never as serious as you think. The funniest part is my lumps only rose after I would be constantly pressing my neck worrying about lumps. Anxiety has a way bigger effect on your body than you realise.  
























 Just read that you passed! Congratulations! :) Knew you could do it!  




 Since summertime last year, I have been feeling extremely anxious literally all the fucking time. The past 9 months or so have really been the toughest I've ever endured. I've felt more and more not like myself, constantly worrying and fearing everything. If one problem gets resolved, I'd just move on to something else to worry about. I always feel sorry for myself and imagine terrible things happening to me. 

Yesterday I cracked, finally. I just lay down on my bed and started crying. It felt so good to cry and just let it out because for the past 9 months or so I've literally felt like things are building up and I'm just gonna explode. 

This evening, I decided that I've had enough. I've simply had enough of anxiety and depression and all the other emotions I feel. It was pouring with rain and dark and I went outside and just did a workout session. I worked up a sweat and just got soaked and muddy. I have to say, in the past 9 months I've never felt so good as I do right now. It feels so empowering just to say "you know what, I don't care about what happens to me, I don't care if all my darkest and most horrible fears become real. I love myself and I'm going to just going to say fuck it, go outside and get dirty".

The funniest thing is, I always see reddit posts about doing excercise and how it changes your frame of mind and makes you feel better but I always just say "fuck it", It probably won't make a difference to me or make me feel worse. But I have to say, I just feel so alive. Now all I want in the whole world is just to keep this feeling going and gain momentum to get out of this rut that I'm in.

Anyways, I just wanted to get that off my chest. To all people who are like me and read posts about doing exercise but never actually do it, please just do it. Just do one honest, hard session. Get dirty and sore, muddy and wet, just do it! 

Thanks for reading! :) 




 You are an evil person.  




 Thanks so much for the response. Means a lot to me :) 




 Don't look at it like you need to pass and if you make one mistake you've failed. Look at it like you've already failed and you need to just drive well in order to pass. Don't concentrate on any mistakes you may  make. I thought I'd definitely failed mine but I persisted and it turned out I passed. No matter how bad a mistake, just imagine you've already failed right from the beginning and it relieves the pressure.  




 Although he was under for long we usually say around 15 minutes is the limit in an avalanche. This person was rescued relatively quickly.  




 I'm a 19 year old guy currently on my gap year (year break before college/university that we do in England). I've been travelling around quite a lot during my year off and I feel like my anxiety/depression is just getting worse. I never have panic attacks like I used to but I constantly just feel anxious. 

The big thing for me is my health. I am always worried about my health, primarily stds. Last year I did something stupid with a girl I didn't know and i literally convinced myself I had HIV. I went and got tested and I didn't have it which was a huge relief. But then at new year i got blackout drunk on a night out and lost some of my friends. Since then I have been worried that I have it again. For some reason I just feel like my drunk self is a total ass-hole who will completely fuck up my life given the chance. I have no reason to believe i got infected, I'm pretty sure i didn't have sex or anything but I just feel like I did something that made me get a disease. I've told myself that I will get tested again after 3 months but even if I come up negative again I don't think thats going to be the end of the problem.

I feel like I always have to have one thing that I'm worrying about. It used to be a brain tumour and then I got scans and after everything came out fine I would switch my anxiety and focus on something else. But there is never a time where I'm just not worried about anything. There is always one thing that I'm fretting over in my mind and it's usually a disease of some sort. 

I just feel so insane. I feel like nothing good will come of me and i will end up as a tragedy, dying young of a disease with stigma attached to it through my own fault.  I've never been to a doc or therapist about my anxiety/hypochondria but I'm starting to think I should. I mean, its nearly been 3 months since new years and I am still constantly worried about having ruined my life over being blackout drunk. That just can't be normal. I feel like I don't like my inner self who is revealed when I get really drunk with friends. I have no self control and I just feel ashamed of myself. The worst part is I didn't used to feel like this. I used to love myself and be proud of things I did, I used to be my friend but I just don't feel that way anymore. I honestly look in the mirror and see someone who I'm afraid and ashamed of when I look into my own eyes. I mean how fucked up is that?

Anyway, the reason I feel like I haven't talked to a doctor or therapist is 1: Because I'm always away and 2: Because I don't actually know If I'm having real issues. Some days the anxiety will still be there in my head but I will be distracted, I'll hang out with my friends and feel happy and I don't know if I truly need help or I just occasionally feel "Sad" because im a young teenager with hormones in me.

But every night I will go to bed and while lying there I will feel scared. Maybe of nothing in particular but just scared and filled with dread. 

Sorry for the rant I just feel I really need to talk about this. Any responses would mean the world to me.  




 A tragedy but all these people are good looking as fuck! 




 Whats the song? Is it from halo? 




 That was fucking cute. 




 Yeah true that. I only wrote "Ecstasy of Gold" in the title because I assumed people know thats Ennio Morricone.  
























 Remember that even in the darkest times you are loved. I love you. Everyone in r/anxiety loves you! You can push through whatever it is you are going through. 




 Please respond to me.  




 Hey! Don't go do anything crazy friend. Wanna talk?  




 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain. - Frank Herbert, Dune

It's more of a quote than a short phrase but it's always helped me. 
 




 Yeah, I agree.  




 Yeah, I remember after my test driving became a lot easier. No pressure when your by yourself.  




 Most TED talks nowadays are like this. 




 Holy fucking shit dude are you me? You pretty much explained exactly how I feel. I am constantly scared of HIV. I had a drunken night with a shady girl, got tested and was negative. Yet now after a night of drinking wherein I got blackout drunk, I am convinced that I somehow got infected through a needle or something. It's like no matter what happens, I'm always going to be anxious about having a serious disease. My lymph nodes have also always been enlarged. I feel like I get all the exact symptoms of HIV. It's crazy. It's literally my worst fear to get it. 

The point is though, we don't. We simply don't have it. If you were to get tested, you would just move on to something else to worry about. The problem isn't HIV, cancer or meningitis, the problem is your anxiety. I feel like a lot of the time you get fear mongering advice like "always get checked, found a lump? get checked. GO TO THE DOCTOR IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO YOUR BODY". You know what I think of that advice for people with hypochondria? fuck it. That type of advice is for people who never worry. When you have anxiety or hypochondira, the only thing you can truly do to sort yourself out is to go to a doctor and get your anxiety sorted out! It is literally a mental illness and it will fucking ruin your life way worse than any disease would. 

I'm in the same boat as you dude. However I try to realise that anxiety is the issue here not the diseases. This quote is really meaningful to me http://sadmoment.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Walter-White-Quote-On-Spending-Your-Whole-Life-Being-Scared-In-Breaking-Bad.jpg. 

Hope you read this! :) 




 Chapter 19: Worrying about chapter 20 




 I BE RUNNIN THROUGH THE 6 WITH MY WOES. UNOHOWDASHITGOES 




 That's exactly like how I felt. Your mind just feels so clear and unclogged. I'm clearly no expert but I feel like anxiety is a problem that only modern society really ever gets. There is no significant biological difference between humans now and humans for the last few thousand years but humans for the last few thousands of years have actually had to do physical activities just to survive. Whereas now people sit down on a computer working 9-5 jobs and then go home and watch Netflix just feeling miserable. Biologically, we need to do physical activity to stay healthy. Technology has just fucked it up for us which is why you got to find the time to do exercise outside of work. 
























 Then watch netflix and cuddle with your dog! And don't say you are a burden. You are not a burden. You are good enough. You don't owe anyone anything. You can get groceries or job hunt when you feel up to it but you are going through a really rough time and you are completely justified in just taking a time out. Does someone with an awful fever say they are a burden when they are lying at home? No. Depression and anxiety are mental diseases. Therefore if you are suffering from them, you are no more being a "burden" than you would be if you had the flu or a broken leg. 

You have to understand that it's not your fault that this has happened to you and you should NEVER feel guilty about not doing mundane tasks because you feel this way. It doesn't matter what anyone else says you should do. Concentrate on the over-riding problem at hand rather than tasks like shopping or job hunting which take an infinitely less priority than your well-being.  




 I think you need to take a day off just to relax. Hide under some blankets and watch a tv show/film that you like, meditate, take a hot bath, just do anything that you know will relax you. When your fiance gets home tell him how you've been feeling and ask him to be with you. You don't have to talk about it or anything but I think you could use the company. It's rough being alone at times like this. I hope I've made you feel at least a little bit better. :)  




 No problem. What do you like doing to relax? Any tv shows or books you're into at the moment? 




 And tell me how it goes. 




 That's okay. If you can, go grab a big glass of water and drink all of it. After that, fill it again and come back to the computer. You should absolutely call your parents if you feel terrible. The fact that they are on vacation shouldn't stop you from doing that. If they knew you were feeling bad they would want you to tell them.  




 Do you have any friends or family you could call right now to talk to and tell them how you feel? If you keep stuff like this bottled up to yourself it can literally drive you insane and it doesn't need to be that difficult. It feels so good to talk about it. Literally call someone who you know will listen, and just let it out. Cry if you need to. Get someone to come round and just open up. If you feel comfortable, talk to your fiance but if not thats fine. If you have no one to talk to, I'm not going anywhere. 




 Okay. Firstly, you have to understand that the state you are in right now is not permanent. You haven't slipped in to a point of no return where you can never feel good again because that simply isn't how depression and anxiety work. This is merely a phase and you will get through it. Its really good that you have already tried to conquer these issues by seeing a psychiatrist so well done! I can't imagine how tough it has been for you this past week but it is going to be okay! have you told your psychiatrist about how you've been feeling recently and is there a way you can get in to contact with them now? 




 It's more than likely that you are just suffering from anxiety. Feeling disorientated and things like that are text book symptoms of becoming over-stressed. Have you ever been to a doctor to talk about how you feel? Are you on meds or anything? 




 That really sucks man :( Im sorry to hear about all that stuff. But first things first. Things like your house being dirty do not matter at the moment. Discard any worry about things like that. Prioritise your mental well-being. So have you felt dizzy for a while or is this a recent thing? 




 Kali. That's a really nice name. So whats the problem? Why are you feeling so down at the moment?  




 Hey! Thanks so much for responding to me. I really wanna talk to you. I wanna make you feel better. My names Isaac, what's yours?
