 The Shabazz hangover. 




 Sweet 16 game, but basically haha. When that game started I was the only one at my house watching. By the time it ended there were 15 people there shouting at the TV 




 Only reason I like this right now is because I want Davidson in. VCU hopefully you guys figure it out in the next week and a half 




 Yesss it's a beautiful thing. Our finals week was always the first week of the tournament...which sounds awful. But then take into consideration that I never had a final later than Tuesday afternoon for those quarters = I'm free all week to watch all the games, plus Spring Break the week after. It was pretty much perfect haha 




 Agree it's worth reading, it's just way easier to find the scores for the bubble teams if they use a button on the scores page. 




 Jeez. Does Nantz realize no one likes him anyway? 




 Look a bit down the thread, it's been discussed 




 You're a champ. I just graduated, I remember balancing finals and March (we were on quarter system). Just think of all the wonderful basketball that awaits when you get through em 




 I see why it's done though. Reward the best teams in the regular season, make it mean more. I'd argue that has at least something to do with why the Horizon has made so much noise in the Big Dance recently. 




 Damn that's a tease. Hope he's alright and that he gets to play next week. 




 He cried? I thought he just daydreamed for a bit 




 bahahaha best manifest destiny joke ever 




 LOL YOU ALL LIVE THERE IT'S 77 DEGREES IN SAN DIEGO TODAY 




 SHE IS A SAINT, YOU HEAR ME, A SAINT 




 Gotcha. What does he use to weight it? 




 Best thing about it is we'll get to find out! I love TJ for you guys though, and Stanley Johnson is the truth, he went to high school near me. I don't wish you bad luck at all 




 I guess I don't understand this as well as I'd like. How does he adjust it exactly if you don't mind me asking? 




 Did anyone see Sacred Heart-Bryant? Double OT, huge shots back and forth. ITS MARCH AND IM SO EXCITED 




 I think Mercer left?

Yeah they went to the SoCon 




 Just a feeling I have. Really am not that high on them this year. No flow offensively. 




 Bill Walton is amazing, no idea what you're talking about

 




 I'm pretty sure the CIT is what you have to pay to play in. They even have a fancy sales-y brochure. http://collegeinsider.com/CIT2015/ 




 Oh totally. I mostly threw that in there to praise the job Archie Miller has done at Dayton. He's had a phenomenal stretch there the past 2 seasons, and he should be getting more hype for COTY awards. 




 This sounds so fun. 




 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXe-zJDZGIE) 




 Bitch he's Frank Mason 




 No one in the Pac 12 makes it out of the first weekend. 




 Teams would still be unlikely to do it, given that taking a spot in an empty game means someone seeded lower than you is guaranteed to play you.

And in the cases that it does happen, it would be exciting as hell. And if you really deserve the higher seed, go beat them anyway. 




 This makes me feel like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHtlnWNkma8 




 "Who would've thought having 0 capable players over 6'7" would turn out poorly in D1 college basketball?"

Survey says: http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/team/roster/_/id/2168/dayton-flyers 




 He's referring to the power-conference/his own mindset towards mid-majors. 




 http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000427085/article/larry-foote-jim-harbaugh-isnt-leaving-nfl-for-michigan

Was talked about more than a month in advance. As soon as it became clear he might not be coaching the 49ers, Michigan was discussed as a possible destination.

Anyway, this is a college basketball thread. I'd love to see Stevens back in college, it just ain't happening in the near future. 




 Except everyone knew that there was a good chance Harbaugh would go to Michigan. 




 I love that your bracket seeds small conference winners over a lot of the at-large teams. To me, this is how it should be, because a lot of those teams deserve to be given that respect. 




 But not on the list of games for each team, where he provides the number of possessions the game had.  




 Well actually..http://kenpom.com/blog/index.php/weblog/entry/the_pre-season_ap_poll_is_great 




 The more I think about it the more I feel that Nantz isn't gonna let Raftery talk and I'll hate Nantz even more. 




 I'm so torn by this.

Raff finally getting to do a Final Four will be awesome. Splitting up him and Verne makes me wanna cry. 




 Flashbacks to Dayton-Ohio State last year. Which was also fun as hell. 




 Wofford's no joke 




 I read this to the rhythm of the Rock Chalk chant and it made me giggle at work. 




 Lol you're very much on the bubble.

EDIT: totally thought that was IU flair. 




 Can Indiana fans stop with the Brad Stevens wishing? It's not gonna happen. 




 I'm rooting for Albany because I remember them being in the game against Florida last year with 5 minutes to go. 




 It has been for the past 5 minutes 




 He does that every game, it's comical 




 That was a textbook finish in transition to ward off the shot blockers. We're cookin here 




 Mostly laugh. 




 lol Stevens is not coming. Put that one to bed. 




 Thing is he really doesn't care about his skillset. Question is will someone pay him (read: take him in the 1st round).

Doesn't look like it right now that's for sure 




 Is that not every game? 




 Is Mosquera-Perea staying though? 




 Fuuuun. At least we get to laugh watching him coach. 




 It's games like this that make me wish I paid for cable. 




 What's his contract situation? 




 The intensity of the Big Dance is there for the small conference tournaments, cuz they know they're basically in the Dance already at that point: it's win or go home. 




 Well, you do get the tournament at home 




 Am I the only one who gets almost more excited for the small conference tournaments?

At least I trick myself into thinking that every year and then the Big Dance starts and I watch 16 games in a day and I spend the rest of the day screaming about how oh so wrong I was. 




 I love your team and Tony Bennett by the way. I'm just saying, you don't get much credit for adjusting to something you knew was coming. 




 What about Syracuse is tricky? Did you guys not know they'd come out running the same defense they've run for almost 40 years? 




 That's a generous interpretation 




 Don't get too dizzy spinning that hard. 




 I mean if you like being salty. 




 Score 2 points in 13 minutes? 




 Oh, SDSU too. 




 Point taken. You know your schedule better than I do, what quality teams have you played that are low-tempo this year? I can think of Utah and Gonzaga. Which to be fair, Gonzaga took you guys to OT at McKale where no one wins, and Utah I think is a little overrated.

I mean, that's one way to look at the strategy of a low-tempo offense. The more positive spin is that you're working to get the best possible shot and you're willing to let the shot clock run down to get that shot, working to get the little inefficiencies to stack up in your favor over the course of a possession through ball movement, cuts, and screens. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle of those two viewpoints. 




 I know it's not my team, but it's gotta be pretty hard to stay angry at Kemba and Shabazz. 




 Right, that's exactly what I mean. A team that's comfortable playing at a low-tempo offensively will be less dissuaded by Arizona slowing them down, especially if that team is still efficient offensively, like Northern Iowa is.

Agree with you about Stanley Johnson though. You need him going. Entirely different team based on how he's playing. 




 At best they show an ability to go high tempo if the game calls for it. Their Tempo numbers on KenPom right now are propped up by their games with Oregon and games against bad teams. 




 Obviously a lot of 1 and 2 seeds are gonna be picked. They're supposed to be the best teams. But there's years where they get picked, idk, 75% of the time and years where they get picked 90% of the time. I'd love to see the difference. 




 **Life Itself, by Roger Ebert**

Love Roger's ability to capture small perfect moments. And he's intelligent without pretension. I'll finish this one quickly I think.

**Six Rivers, by Peter Coates**

Super interesting history of six influential rivers around the world. It's slow reading, and designed to tell stories that are river-centric rather than anthropocentric, giving the river agency, that kinda thing. It's interesting stuff. I like filling in my ecological knowledge like this, and I've always liked bodies of water. 




 I'd love to see a compilation of expert picks going into the 08 tournament and compare how often those 1 seeds were picked to go to the Final Four compared to the aggregate from other years, but I'm not sure such a database exists. 




 Yeah, that's why it's not as much of a knife in the resum to me haha. That's exactly what I'm saying. 




 Yes for Utah, I'd say for Arkansas it's probably got more to do with no one is getting penalized for losing at Rupp at this point. 




 VCU's still good though, Dayton's just underrated right now. Archie Miller is doing a hell of a job. Wouldn't be surprised at all to see them in the second weekend if they get the right matchups.

Anyway. Teams with multiple bigs of a caliber that could give Okafor problems are few and far between, and most of them are on this list of 7 haha. 




 I get that, I've followed college hoops since I was a kid. But I've never looked at the top group of teams and felt like they were as separate from the pack as they are this year.

That being said, it's a single-elimination tournament played by 18-22 year olds. Anything can happen 




 The upside is there. Just not convinced, personally. Better shot than my alma mater! 




 Gotcha, better than a lot of people dismissing em out of hand!

Hard to judge the Waves against Gonzaga because they just don't have the size to matchup effectively. They got killed in both matchups by Wiltjer (6'10") and Sabonis (6'10"). And those losses were by a combined 10 points.

I don't wanna say they're excusable losses for BYU, just that Pepperdine is a lot better than most sub-100 teams. 




 Thing is, Duke also plays at a fast tempo and is used to riding their horses for heavy minutes at that pace. West Virginia and VCU don't score enough to keep up with Duke unless they shoot the lights out of the ball, which is always the great equalizer of the NCAA Tournament (see: Norfolk State-Mizzou. God that game still blows my mind)

If Duke loses to someone outside this group, it's gonna be because they just didn't play defense. All of their losses are that way. 




 The thing about these teams is that it wouldn't surprise me at all if all 7 of them made the Elite 8. There are no real matchup nightmares for any of these teams outside this group, because they're all damn good teams.

I guess I'd say Arizona doesn't want to face another low-tempo team who's big enough to match up with them but also efficient on offense. Both the MVC teams come to mind. 




 That's a fair enough point haha. It's also probably unfair to assume that if you were in the Final Four you guys would still look like you have lately.  




 Say what you want about him, the man makes a great drinking game if he's calling a matchup you don't care (that much) about.

1. Take a drink every time he disagrees with a call.
2. Take 2 drinks every time he says something is "ridiculous".
3. Take 3 drinks every time he brings up the NCAA.
4. Finish your drink every time he proposes a rule change.


Seriously though I like Bilas for the reasons that have been laid out here already. The man knows hoops and is refreshingly free from a lot of the media narratives about teams. Don't always agree with him, but always want to hear what he has to say. 




 Pepperdine is underrated. Definitely not there yet, but the building blocks are there. Have you actually seen them play? 




 I hate the Seattle pod in the East. Northern Iowa and Butler, two smaller schools who could legitimately make a regional final if things broke the right way? And two of the more dangerous mid-major teams in the country in Valpo and Murray State?

FUCK YOU SAME POD.

Seriously all 4 of those teams could win a game in the tournament, if not two or three. I know it's all done on bracketing principles but I'd be so bummed if that was a real pod in two weeks. 




 Except you wouldn't be the favorite on Monday. You'd be the team people were surprised was there. 




 Wofford yes. Baylor is playing great basketball right now, and really have flown under the radar all year. Pretty much the only reason people look at them like an upset candidate is Scott Drew, which is lazy thinking. He's been proving he's not a joke for awhile now. 




 https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/haithitrain.gif?w=694 




 Kind of an aside, but the Rays are building our old bullpen out in Tampa haha. Jepsen is obviously out there, but they signed Frieri and Kohn too.

Obviously now that Zobrist is in Oakland they look a lot better though, which is frustratingly predictable. 




 Honestly Chuck feels lazy now. It's kind of sad. Tried reading Damned and it just didn't do shit for me. 




 Only thing about Goodreads is that Amazon bought it not too long ago, and the recommendations are now generated off of that platform. So you'll get basically what Amazon thinks you'll like. Other than that, Goodreads is good stuff. 




 Cowart has been done for a while now in the eyes of the organization. Kubitza had a .405 OBP at AA last year too. And that's with a high strikeout rate apparently. This is the guy we're looking at as our 2016 3B. 




 Either that or Narcissus and Goldmund 
























 Came here to say the food, was not disappointed


Also people like the riddle/adventure/ancient legend combo that's present in a lot of the books, as well as the idea of cute talking animals 




 Also Jay Wright has done an amazing job this year, but I really feel like Chris Holtmann deserved Coach of the Year. 




 The way people are talking in here it's like Arcidiacono turned into Aaron Craft 




 Halley's Comet appearances 




 I agree, take an upvote. I'm just saying it sucks, and they're a good basketball team. It's a shitty situation when a team like Murray State gets 1 chance to prove they're worthy, and a team like nameamajorconferencebubbleteam gets 10.  




 It's not the analysis, it's the spirit of it. He's right. 




 I just said I don't think they deserve an at-large. I said I think they're a good basketball team. Which they are. 




 In November. With injuries.

Have you seen them play this year? 




 I think I'm being downvoted for things said elsewhere, not here. Which is funny but whatever.

Well, best of luck to you guys! Would've been cool to see what you could've done with a full year of Rice 




 That joke made me spittake at my desk. The Limewire thing hahahaha 




 Russian Roulette 




 Well that's your shot right there 




 Said it below, don't have a team. So at least you've got that going for you, my school has no chance and will never have a chance at the tournament 




 I'd flair up if I had a team! I'm just a college hoops fan, I went to UCSD, whose men's bball program is bad even for D2.

You guys have got a shot. How do you feel about Groce?

And I think that's debatable, Murray State is legit man. Once they got their full roster in place they started on that tear. That's not to say they'd be any better necessarily, I just don't think it's cut and dried. 




 Look, I don't think most people in here think Murray State's resume should get them in. I don't think anyone will have complaints if they don't get in.

Where it's bothering me is people acting like they're not a good basketball team. If you don't think this team is good, you either haven't seen them play, or have an axe to grind with them/mid-majors in general.  




 Hahah not at all, it's just a reddit thread. I'm more stoked it happened, but thanks for the offer! 




 The NBAPA are the ones blocking the age limit from going up. It's an owner thing. 




 Holy shit we came up with that at the same time. Take an upvote 




 Things you can say about the tournament bubble, but not your girlfriend 




 Lol it means Illinois fans are scared they won't get in and are taking that angst out by shitting on a truly exciting mid-major team who got beat by Belmont playing a great, great game in the OVC title game. 




 How'd that work out for ya? 




 The only people who hate you are the ones who are afraid you're gonna take their bid away. 




 I've never seen that GIF of Crean adjusting his pants in the comments, and it was pure gold 




 Spoken like a true fan of a truly underwhelming bubble team 




 That's the impression I've gotten from a distance too. It's just weird, I figured he'd be a solid head coach. 




 Not even begrudging respect? :P 




 Kinda surprised Snaer didn't get thrown in until now, dude was amazing. 




 Yeah I remember, Robbie Hummel was one of my favorite players. That team was forreal.

I didn't realize Etwaun had stuck in the NBA though, thought he got bounced. Then my roommate was watching the Thunder-Bulls game and I saw him hit a game-winner. Made my day haha, I was so pleasantly surprised. 




 I got a chance to go to the Sweet 16 and Elite 8 in Anaheim last year. Even as a person with no vested rooting interest, I was captivated. So worth it. You should go if you have the chance. 




 I feel like the ACL gods owe you guys a couple. 




 Me too! As always, it'll be fun as hell no matter what!

Hey just curious, as an Alabama fan, how do you feel about Anthony Grant's coaching job? 




 Fair enough for last year.

I hope it goes without saying that last year is not this year, though. 




 Famous last words. 




 Nova has lost exactly twice. How often is this phenomenon happening in your opinion? 




 It won't happen in this climate because SDSU is much stronger than UCLA at the moment, and UCLA wants to be able to claim supremacy in California when recruiting.

Although Sean Miller runs California in actuality. 




 Honestly every time I've watched them (admittedly it's been the bigger games, many of which have been losses), I've thought they have no fight at all. It's seemed to me that when another team makes a run, it just drags on and on because Utah doesn't have the fight in them.

The one exception to this is Brandon Taylor. The only one consistently playing hard when they're losing. I wouldn't be surprised at all if they were about to get upset in the Round of 64 and Taylor put the whole team on his back for crunch time.  




 The 11-13 lines are so dangerous this year it's crazy 




 Better get through Boise. Team is legit. 




 Dasean Butler is so underrated. And the moment with Huggins at the Final Four literally brings tears to my eyes every time. 




 Juan Dixon got me into college hoops. Dude was awesome. 




 Not saying they can't do it, saying that the Sweet 16 at the very least is a tall order. When you say you don't expect to make it that far, but then that you expect to make it further than 75% of the teams in the tournament, it's a confusing contradiction haha.

I was lucky enough to be at both of the Arizona-SDSU games last year (I'm a UCSD alum haha, I live in the area), they were both fantastic atmospheres and fantastic games. 




 Which I understand. If Kansas is seeded higher than Wisconsin on the 1-68 true seed list, which is what my statement is predicated on and what I mean when I say "if they pass them", they'd get first crack at the Midwest geographically, which sends Wisconsin elsewhere. 




 Woah that's potentially interesting. The Waves have played you guys tough, it's Sabonis and Wiltjer that have killed them.

Veeeeerryyy interesting. 




 I giggled at that call. 

I'm mostly excited at the prospect of you guys getting in cuz the Paladins is a dope mascot. 




 I'm still just mystified at how his arms manage to look short on TV.

Good luck to you guys, I think you have backdoor second-weekend potential if you get the right matchup 




 Props to you for actually realizing it. I feel like so many Syracuse fans I've talked to don't even acknowledge that that game was close. 




 Syracuse-UNC Asheville a couple years back. Should've happened, refs took it away from the Bulldogs.

Southern took Gonzaga to the wire 2 years ago. Coastal Carolina was winning in the second half against Virginia last year. Albany hung with Florida last year.

I feel like people assume these games are always blowouts; a lot of them are, yeah, but many of them are not. It's a lot closer than we think. 




 That's pretty far 




 Putting my foot in my mouth. Watching him play his arms look so short. But apparently he's got the wingspan of a goddamn condor lol 




 Well if Kansas passes Wisconsin on the two line it's possible. So if Wisconsin loses in the B1G tournament to someone bad and Kansas wins the Big 12, there's a chaaaaance. But a small one. 




 Yeah this is just not true 




 Anya is nowhere near long enough to be effective against UK unless they just get bullied. Which I doubt happens. 




 First to 90 wins! 




 VCU is entirely different without Briante Weber. 




 I've been making the argument that you guys have no chance.


But hell if I don't have hope you guys get in anyway 




 Well it is Bleacher Report. 




 Man Robbie Hummel was the best. 




 You guys expect to lose? Damn.  




 That's fair enough. I've seen a lot of reactions all over the place, guess that's what happens when you have a massive fan base. Northwestern is definitely a trap game too, they're a decent squad. 




 Shiiit I didn't mean to be a douche. My bad. 




 Curious. Are there Indiana fans who are still confident about tournament chances?

EDIT: I'm a douche sometimes. 




 Should've missed the first one too 




 His reactions are the best 




 It's been awesome to see them get on this weird little mini-roll. 

That being said, don't really want them to steal a bid from Green Bay and/or Valpo. 




 Big South was crazy yesterday, so much fun watching all the ends of the games at work 




 It's the same reason they don't have a tournament, so it doesn't fuck up their school schedules. But then one of them makes the big dance and fucks it up anyway 




 3, 4, 5, 7 for me. 2 was my next team out. 




 Grade inflation abounds, this is just one of the more comical examples. 




 With Dez its worth it tho 




 9th seeded Longwood* 




 Totally agree with what you're saying functionally; we should have clear path foul rules. Just pointing out that layups and dunks, the likes of which clear path fouls are committed to prevent, are missed far more often at this level than at the professional level 




 I feel like for timeouts, they should be able to just take less with them to the last minute. Every time I see Roy Williams call 4 timeouts in the last minute of play I want to throw something at him. 




 If you have possession and you're sliding on the floor, it's almost always called a travel. It's considered moving your pivot foot (technically) 




 I agree with your larger point, but there are a significant number of layups and dunks that get missed in exactly this situation in college hoops haha. 




 Yeah it's supposed to be sub-100 RPI are bad losses. Yale's 69th right now. 




 Nahh you didn't shit the bed, Boatright and Shabazz just destroyed your backcourt. Little different.  




 Khaliff Wyatt was the truth in that game. You guys deserved to win 




 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_cat_bounce

Basically just means that even something that is sucking can see a small positive reversal after their huge fall before settling into newfound suckitude. 




 Hahaha dammmmmit.  




 And the first 1 seed of the conference tournaments goes down! It's in the air baby 




 Upset alert in the Big South! 1 seed Charleston Southern trails by 8 at the under 4 timeout 




 All good :) 




 No they're not. 




 [From the Conference Tournaments Day 4 Thread](http://www.yalebulldogs.com/sports/m-baskbl/2011-12/releases/20120125cbh295) 




 Oh yeah that ban was definitely only done when they realized they probably wouldn't make it anyway. 




 Honestly I think it depends what BYU does. If BYU only loses to Gonzaga in the WCC tournament, they have a good shot to get in the Big Dance, and both of Gonzaga's losses will be to tournament teams (1 on the road in OT to a fellow 2 seed). Hard to take that away.

And honestly, even if they lost in the WCC tournament it'd be hard to knock em off the 2 line. 




 Betting Boeheim doesn't stay through the sanctions. He's seemed bored and frustrated for awhile now. 




 The Top 25 was more as a recognition of a perfect conference record and not having lost in a really long time, than having actually earned their way into the polls.

I wish there was room for an at-large like Murray State, but the way selection works, pretty much every bubble team would have to take an awful loss in the conference tournaments to even think about it. 




 I just started a new job and I'm slightly worried about my performance in the next few weeks. 




 I honestly don't know how much you can read into this one though. Once the blitz was on, it was on. This game was only contested for like 10 minutes, and the last 30 were just playing out the conclusion that was already written.

Davidson deserved to win, and win big, but VCU is better than this, even in the last three games, even without Briante. IMO.


That being said you could dead cat bounce through your next 2 games and get smoked in the tournament. Who knows. 




 Sadly nope. No beef to the resume at all 




 Yes yes so much yes 
























 The Big East had a couple teams overseeded, yes. There is no way Dayton was making it to the 6 line. Best case scenario was a 7. 

I'm not saying Xavier deserves their 6 (they don't), I'm saying Dayton wasn't in play for the 6. 




 You should be stoked, it's the coolest thing ever. I went for the first time last year and I had sky-high expectations, and it shattered them 




 Which would be one of the greatest things of all time, cuz he'd have approximately 97 points 




 It's a lot of losses for a 6 seed. 




 Take it up with UCLA and Indiana, not the Big East 




 They're like the 6th best team in the region, maybe. 




 Enjoy the Madness! 




 Fair enough! You guys have a great team, I just think Kentucky is the worst possible matchup for you (lol, as if they aren't for everyone)

I loooove Jerian Grant, one of my favorite players. I have him taking you guys to the Elite 8, he's just so fun to watch 




 I like him better than Haws. Although Haws is obviously still awesome. 




 Depends how big the pool is. If it's 50 people, this is a great strategy. If you're playing against hundreds, you'll probably have to get almost everything right to win this way. 




 EWU's not terrible. You guys are just getting labeled as March underachievers, and are therefore a sexy upset pick. 




 I'd say you have to get insanely lucky and have nearly a perfect bracket, or pick someone other than Kentucky to win the national title and hope it goes down that way. 




 Notre Dame only plays one player who's above 6'5", and they have a short bench. It's gonna be really hard for them to beat Kentucky. 




 Haws is good, he's not the best guard in the country. Maybe top 10. 




 I've got Northern Iowa. The game is gonna turn on if Lousiville is able to get out and run, cuz they're not gonna have a good time in the halfcourt. 




 FWIW, WVU has said Staten and Browne are going to play. 




 This is my diciest pick. I have a hunch about Wofford, is all it really is. I think they'll be able to slow the game down and Arkansas will get frustrated. Arkansas has the talent of a top 10 team. The reason they aren't a top 10 team is because they struggle to put it together a lot of the time. If this game is close in the first half, I can see them starting to crack.

This is, admittedly, my least defensible pick. 




 They outscored the league by that much because the league was not very good this year, at all.

The wins were by an average of 24.6 points because they weren't playing good teams haha. The best win of them was Stanford, who just straight gave up in the second half. I get you're a Pac 12 fan, but Utah is vulnerable here. Could they win this game, then go beat Duke in the Sweet 16? Hell yeah, they're talented enough to. But they're slumping right now, and they're vulnerable. 




 Don't trust SDSU. Seen them play a couple times this year, don't think they can score enough. Obekpa being out does make it interesting, but I feel like St John's will win. But that's the beauty of the tournament, who the hell am I? 




 Duke has a significant size advantage with Okafor against you. 1 of 5 guys.

If you play Kentucky, they'll have a significant size advantage over you at all 5 positions. 




 And the 162nd ranked offense in terms of efficiency. It's not good enough to beat Duke unless Duke looks disinterested (which has happened a couple times this year).

It's not impossible, just unlikely 




 There's a certain amount of this here too:

http://dc243.4shared.com/img/0-YPtbQE/s7/13eee3b8430/introduce_a_little_anarchy 




 SF Austin has the best chance. Buffalo has a solid shot at pulling one, and are well-coached. Wofford is a veteran team that a lot of experts like, but the metrics hate. Wyoming has by far the hardest matchup; Northern Iowa is a better version of themselves. 




 I heard they lost them somewhere around Heartbreak City. 




 Idk about that. Bennett is a great coach. I think Michigan State will win, but saying Bennett isn't a good coach is just foolishness 




 Iowa State. 




 Yeah forgot to throw that in there hahaha. Would truly be a bold statement if I meant the field. 




 UNC also happened to put a couple of those close games in the win column, including victories over Virginia and Louisville in the past week. 




 A good point. Wofford is an incredibly low-tempo team, however, so 67 PPG is not bad in that regard. Call this one a hunch; I just have a feeling Arkansas will get flustered. They have a tendency to do that.

I do think Arkansas is a really good team, capable of doing damage. Just think Wofford will get em. 




 That's why I can't wait! Gonna be an awesome 3 weeks 




 You beat them at home. You have 4 road wins all year, the best of which is probably Northwestern. Purdue has a road win at Indiana and a neutral site win over BYU. They do have bad losses, but they happened awhile ago, when the team was still struggling to put it together. I think them being 1 seed line higher is totally justified. 




 Soooo....you split with them. Congrats? You have 1 top 50 win, they have 4. That's significant. 




 *in the region 




 Massively underrated in the way people are talking about them. I think they got the seed they deserved. And they were ahead of Wisconsin btw, they're only behind Kentucky. 




 Yes. You answered your own question. If you're the weakest 2 seed, then yes, I would like you as my 2. 




 Based on your resume, a 10 is pretty accurate. You guys have certainly looked better than that at times though. 




 The edge I think is Gonzaga's height. Otherwise they're actually pretty similar teams. But a lot of people don't believe in Gonzaga in March. 




 Notre Dame only has one rotation player above 6'5" (Zach Auguste), and he struggles with foul trouble. 




 If Justin Jackson shoots 4/5 from three like he did against Virginia, UNC can beat anyone in the field. Anyone. That performance blew my mind. 




 To me, it's either this or SFA/EWU that has the most likely 12/13 second-round matchup. 




 Not even a little bit. I'd wager that most people are picking Texas, and 8/9 games are a coin flip, statistically. 




 For the record, I like you guys in this match-up. My post was just meant to be a couple quick-hitters about why people think they could do it.

Devin Williams is a bad man, and underrated as shit. 




 Losing Obekpa is big, but SDSU just cannot score. Like at all. Hard for me to pick them over the Johnnies, even without Obekpa. 




  They may not have had the resume to deserve their tourney bid, but they have the talent to win some games.

This is exactly how I feel about UCLA haha. The annoying thing about it is that when they win a game or two, the story will be about how everyone doubted them. No. No one doubts your talent. We just think you didn't earn your spot. 




 Oh absolutely. That's why these two are 8 and 9 and not, say, in the mix for a top 4 seed. 




 Good luck! Enjoy the Madness :) 




 Thanks! I love me some college hoops haha, and I follow it all year. This is like Christmas for me.

Oh I love Arkansas, also just have a gut feeling about Wofford haha. I also think they have a tendency to get a little out of control, and that can hurt them if they find the game close and Wofford hits some shots.

I'd probably have taken Cincy over any other 8/9 seed, but Purdue is playing well right now, and I think Cincy is realllly gonna struggle to score. But they've had a fantastic year given everything they've gone through. 




 Buffalo takes care of the ball well, gave Kentucky a decent game, and plays with pace. They are well-coached, and have a legit star in Justin Moss. They're not scintillating offensively, but they're not bad at anything. 




 I'm rooting for it too! The world needs more Tyler Harvey.

Utah is slumping, and SFA is an incredible team. SFA is probably the most popular 12 over a 5 pick, and for good reason. SFA went to OT with Northern Iowa earlier in the year, and Northern Iowa is a team a lot of people think can make the Final Four. Utah has lost 4 of 7 coming into the tournament, and hasn't looked that good doing it. Delon Wright is really good for the Utes, but personally, I think we're gonna see Stephen F Austin take it.
 




 Not without rebounding extraordinarily well for a team their size. Gonna be incredibly difficult, and they really have no answer for Towns inside. If they shoot it well, they might. Otherwise, nope. 




 8/9 winners: Purdue, Oregon, LSU, St John's

5/12 winners: West Virginia, Wofford, Northern Iowa, Stephen F Austin

Wichita State. Indiana is trending downward and Wichita reeeeally wants the Kansas game.

UNC. Paige is finally starting to play well again. Meeks is getting healthy. If Justin Jackson can keep shooting the ball well, they're a threat to get to Indianapolis.

BYU if they win, Xavier if Ole Miss wins. Xavier is the most overseeded team in the field, and BYU is really good, and playing great ball right now.

Ohio State can win a game, but I'd be amazed if they beat Arizona in the Round of 32.

Davidson could make the second weekend if they catch Gonzaga on an off night, but it's hard to picture them beating Iowa State. That being said, the way they shoot the three, it's not impossible.

I think UCLA will get SMU. Norman Powell is really good, UCLA takes care of the ball, and SMU is turnover-prone. If UCLA stays out of foul trouble, they could do it.

This is the best Gonzaga team in a while. NDSU is good, but man will they have to have the game of their lives to pull this off, especially given the Zags size. That being said, a 15 seed beat a 2 seed just a few years ago by having the game of their lives (Norfolk State over Missouri).

Michigan State. They're peaking at the right time and Izzo knows his way around this month. Georgia isn't to be taken lightly, but the Spartans should be favored.

Providence, Dayton, and OU are all legit teams. Dayton will be playing at home. OU probably has the best team. Providence will have the best player in any game. All three are very well-coached. This is one of the best pods in the first two rounds. I have Providence, but none of these three is wrong (and hell, Albany might get OU in the first round)

I have Nova. They're really really strong. Northern Iowa is also awesome, and a veteran group to boot. Louisville would be dicey. They're not playing that well right now. The 8/9 winner will have a decent shot at getting Villanova, but to me, Jay Wright will coach circles around Johnny Jones or (EDIT: Mark Gottfried, not Steve Lavin. Silly me). Not to mention they're really really good.
 




 Villanova is massively underrated IMO. That being said, I also think they got the hardest 8/9 draw of the 1 seeds. LSU and NC State both have the talent to beat anyone in the tournament. 




 EWU over Georgetown is tempting. EWU has the number 1 scorer in the country in Tyler Harvey, and shoot the 3 well, which is a great formula for an upset. Georgetown is a team a lot of people see as overseeded, and they have a psychological hurdle to overcome in proving that they won't be undone by a low seed in the first weekend yet again.

That being said, EWU doesn't play a lick of defense and Georgetown's offense is actually pretty good. So it depends how likely you think EWU is to get hot and outscore Georgetown. It's definitely not the most ridiculous upset pick, and it might be the most likely 13 over a 4. 




 4 percentage points? Are we gonna call that significant? 




 Best one of these for me was UConn winning it all in 2011. 




 Talent-wise and matchup-wise, they're probably the most equipped to beat Kentucky.

But Rick Barnes. 




 I'm hoping so bad for that SFA/Duke game. I think Duke would win but I think it would be amazing 




 Arizona has completely changed my mind in the past few weeks. They've looked really really good 




 SDSU to the Elite 8 is crazier than any of those haha. 




 Kentucky/Notre Dame
Wisconsin/Arizona
Villanova/Providence
Duke/Gonzaga 




 Not totally fair to say. Washington had their best player on the team still at that point (Upshaw), and were well on course to make the tournament with him on the team. 




 Why the Providence hate? Team is good. 




 Iowa is a 7, Iowa State is a 3. They can't play til the Sweet 16. 




 For what it's worth, that's also why Kansas keeps getting really high seeds. The committee rewards difficult schedules. 




 60 minutes? Damn that sure seems like asking a lot. 




 Texas isn't a bad loss, even right now.. 




 Yesss, I read Walden before I read Into the Wild, and I feel exactly the same way about it. Thoreau had some amazing truths to tell 




 No, no no no, no no no no no.

Seriously there's absolutely zero chance Kentucky isn't the number 1 overall seed unless the whole team gets declared ineligible. 




 It's just Duke/UVA is a matchup between two 1 seeds that went toe to toe the first time they played and Duke/UNC is the most popular matchup possible in any college game for ESPN. They just really don't want you to make it. 




 Reason being that you're the only team in the semis that would not create a delicious final for TV 




 That's wrong tho. You don't have to be stationary.

EDIT: These rules apply to a secondary defender. A primary defender can be giving ground and still draw a charge. 




 Into the Wild is a fascinating read. People got more than a little caught up in deciding who was right about Chris McCandless, but it's a fantastic story. 




 We were not all that far away from a Michigan-Penn State semifinal. Great effort by both teams, but the better teams won.

And man did DJ Newbill break my heart at the end. What a player. 




 This is EXACTLY how I've felt for the past year. Thanks for everything you do Mark. This, this right here? Made me cry. 




 Hammons has a smooth stroke at the line for a big 




 DON'T GOT NO TEAM CUZ MY SCHOOL IS SHITTY EVEN FOR D2 I JUST LOVE COLLEGE HOOPS CUZ I GREW UP WATCHING 




 Only thing in that sequence I thought was out of the ordinary was the quick timeout awarded. Everything else seemed fair to me. 




 Jeeeeeez eat your heart out La Salle. March is amazing but it can be brutal 




 Game was won and lost on those 50/50 balls down the stretch. Wisconsin got them and turned empty trips into points every time.

That said, Michigan played a hell of a game 




 Everyone always throws out hiring full-time officials. Yes, that would be ideal. It's also far easier to do for 30 teams, who can play a maximum of 15 games a night (which never happens), than it is to do for 351 teams in D1. Logistically that is a million times more difficult than a 30 team league like the NBA. 




 Every year we get at least one great dancing players GIF from college hoops. Who are the front runners this year, and who can surprise us in the tournament and take the title? 




 Holy shit I clicked on that and looked at the other scores from the day in the box above..Texas was still ranked 11. 




 They were better for 36 minutes of the game. Team is a combination of snakebit and Rick Barnes'd. 




 It's cuz he was about to say Longhorns lol 




 HEY UNC

MARCUS PAIGE'S BAGGY ASS UNIFORM MAKES HIM LOOK LIKE A GIRLFRIEND WHO SPENT THE NIGHT AND BORROWED YOUR CLOTHES 




 Really? You hung tough with an underrated team that you don't match up well with without your best player and you're mad?

Damn. 




 Man I love Devin Williams. Keep your head up Devin, you're gonna be a big part of next weekend for your team. 




 Jumala's saying these are counterexamples of "finishing sentence[s]" sucking. As in these last lines are all quite good. 




 Just the way the teams are playing right now, Indiana would likely be a much easier matchup. 




 You should be much more worried about BYU than Indiana haha 




 This is exactly how I feel.

"Well if I have one game on TV, one game on my laptop, and one game on my phone.." 




 I too love The Brothers Karamazov! Keep reading the Russians. 
























 He was comically far away from the ball on that slide. I do not miss watching him play defense at all 




 To me, the popularity of YA novels has a lot to do with the accessibility of the emotion in them. It doesn't tend to be couched in philosophy or overly complicated (which is not to say they can't be emotionally nuanced); it's just that the characters feel in a way that resonates with how people feel. 

A lot of the time in literary/more serious fiction, the book is exploring those emotions and what makes them work/how they come to pass/how we can understand those emotions more. Which is hard work that a lot of people don't want to do or are intimidated by.  




 That is insane. 




 To be fair, none of those have been articulated. He's just getting downvoted to shit. 




 I actually don't dislike you guys, despite the fact that we're gonna have a crazy battle in the division this year..

But Rodney I can't stand and love watching him struggle. 




 We're almost as bad I think.  




 :(  




 Made it to Saturday's game versus the Royals. Can't beat them lately haha. 




 Trout is a pretty funny guy. He's normal as hell, but that doesn't mean he has no personality.

Pujols' persona is a machine, but even then he goofs off with everybody. He's just not that way to the media because he doesn't want to be.

Have you ever seen this: http://deadspin.com/pujols-trout-mock-fernando-rodneys-arrow-celebration-1608225059

Maybe not the most eccentric thing ever done, but Angels fans loved it. 




 Clearly you follow the team.. 




 Well that's a good way to honor a "classy, professional and hard working" guy; be a dick in his name. 




 One minor correction: Rule 5 selections are bought from their current teams for 50k, and if they do not stay on the 25-man roster for the entire year, must be offered back to their original team for half price (12.5k). They don't automatically go back to the original team. 




 I'm not saying your content is wrong or unwarranted; it's totally vaild analysis. Your tone is just overly hostile. It's extremely common for fans of a particular CBB team to knee-jerk and say that a guy isn't ready for the next level when they declare their intentions to leave. People wanted to see him stay (for selfish reasons), and they're upset that's not gonna happen. I'm not sure if you've read the other threads in here with players declaring, but every fan base does it. It's silly and short-sighted, but it doesn't deserve a curb-stomping. 




 I'd argue that it happens more often once you get a big lead cuz then the bottom part of the bullpen starts throwing innings, and those guys are in the bottom tier of the bullpen for a reason. 




 I had a spiral fracture in the fifth metacarpal and never got a cast...granted I should have. But I was playing basketball again within a month. 




 Yeah no. It's obviously shitty but this is a bad idea. Unless you make an extremely strong case that he went out there intending to hurt a guy, you don't do this. 




 Andrew Luck also was in a position to turn down the money. Not everyone is blessed with the financial and familial stability to do so. 




 You're right, but shit man. Chill out a bit. 




 Kinda surprised there's no Infinite Jest in here, but I'll throw it in. Although I guess you can say stuff happens. To me, the action-to-length ratio is way way way small enough to be included here. 




 You have to get lucky to win in baseball. You guys got lucky last year. You're still a good team. Doesn't mean you're not lucky. You won't keep hitting .329 with a .401 OBP as a team. 

Enjoy it but please don't pretend like it's anything other than what it is: a hot start. 




 I was at that game. Still cannot believe he threw him out. Watching the throw in person was just silly. Stadium didn't really know what happened lol. 




 Because there was no fielding error committed on the first play, but there was on the second play. First play is two steals, second play is a steal and a throwing error.

It's definitely not reflective of what actually happened (incompetence on both plays), but since no one physically misplayed the ball, there is no error. A similar situation is when a fly ball drops between two people who both thought the other person had it. Obviously it should've been caught, but no one dropped/missed it, so it can't be counted as an error.

TLDR: Fielding errors have too narrow of a defintion, so sometimes people get rewarded with stats even though dumb plays were made. 




 I think 7:00 PST, not EST. 




 That moment. Makes me cry every time. 




 Thank you for someone knowing that. I work at a university, it's astounding how many people think you can do stuff like that. 




 Yeah haha it was really annoying.

Honestly what did us in was our batting average with RISP. 2 for 25 on the series. That's just not gonna get it done, ever, in any circumstance. 




 Oh I just hate Aoki cuz of his catches in Game 2. Both of them were miracles and he taunted our crowd after both. Which I'd love against anyone but my team and now hate him for 




 We're taking you down this weekend, and getting a tiny little shred of revenge for the ALDS..

But seriously your team is so much fun it's hard hating you. Especially now that Aoki is gone, dude was a clown in Game 2. 




 Dude he did a great job this year. Not saying the best job, but it's far from indefensible to choose him. His team was predicted 9th in the Big 12. 




 I'd be curious to see who was off by more percentage points in each game's win probability. Although that sounds like lots of arithmetic. 




 The score is still Q to 12, by the way. 




 Thank you. Thank you so much. 




 Why have I never heard of this. This is so cool.

They also stream all the games here: http://pit2015.net/

Sooo I know what I'm doing this weekend. 




 Well, that is the main problem with a 3-2 anyway, and why you almost never see it run. 




 You did write it in an odd, kinda confusing way. To be fair. 




 Perry Ellis, called consistent. Literally never thought I would see or hear that.

EDIT: Why is this being downvoted again? He was crazy inconsistent for a long time. 




 They go to the NBA last year, they already got paid and they'll continue to get paid while they rehab and/or work on their game while riding the bench.

They could just as easily have gotten hurt this year. More easily probably, considering they played way more minutes at UK than they would've in the league. 




 He got a concussion. 




 Not to be a dick, but since we're talking about words and all...

hijacked* 




 Yes you are 




 There are arguments to be had both ways, and honestly, both sides have merit. Whatever ends up happening will have people claiming confirmation of one side over the other. The best answer is we don't know, but they certainly could have done a lot worse, and there's not many people who would've been better hires. 




 I get the reasons why it would happen, it's still bananas that they have a winning record in the second round even though most of the time they're playing a 4 seed. 




 Florida lost a lot but brought back a good bit too.

On paper Maryland looks real good next year. We'll see how it shakes out 




 Florida was preseason top 10 this year and finished below .500. He's saying it doesn't mean shit. Although KenPom disagrees. 




 Yeah I see why you used the numbers you did. I didn't even think about the S-curve there, although you're right. Bracketing principles usually keep it from being totally implemented though, don't they?

Wow, 16-15? That's crazy that 12 seeds have a winning record in the second round. 




 I'd argue the 12 or 13 has just as good of a path, if not a better one, seed wise, in the first weekend at least. 




 Didn't see Delon Wright for a second and got confused. 


Super happy Jerian Grant made first-team, he deserves it. 




 Jeez a 3 seed? For a team that lost twice in a major conference? 

Debate how you will about the ACC vs. Big East. I think the ACC is definitely better; that much better I don't think I'd agree with.

We can agree to disagree about being impressed with Nova. It's quite possible that you and I just watched them on different days and saw different things. Your opinion was certainly vindicated as much as it can be in a single-elimination tournament. I just stand by the reasoning that NC State is an extremely talented basketball team who can beat anyone when playing well, Villanova played awful, and they still almost won the game. 




 NC State deserving to win and Nova being overrated are two entirely different things.

You guys have an incredibly talented but inconsistent basketball team, one that beat Duke earlier this year. Villanova played their worst game of the season. 

You guys won by 3.. 




 I didn't want to like that but I did because it's so damn true 




 It's been realllllly sloppy. But intense, sure 




 That one's a good possibility. But the chances of everyone rolling through the first weekend without playing a close game are slim. 




 At least someone will have a close game, it's almost guaranteed 




 You guys will be in the conversation next year. Beau Beech is awesome 




 Honestly most people would've been pretty OK with switching your team and Dayton. 




 HEY BRACKET, NONE OF US ARE EVEN CLOSE TO HAVING YOU FILLED IN RIGHT, WHICH IS WAY LESS THAN I CAN SAY ABOUT YOUR MOTHER 




 Sorry man :( 




 Hampton coach, Hampton 




 That was the only game of that tournament UConn deserved to lose. 




 I seriously doubt it, given the level of discourse at ESPN sometimes.

It would be an awesome thing though. 




 Yeah, I found myself making the assumption that it couldn't be Dawkins because of the K connection, but it's all I can really see.
 




 It seems like the institutional resources would be there if you guys can put it together though. 




 Sooo, Stanford? 




 That's what I was saying haha. I don't see OSU being able to pull it off at all. The only reason I gave them any shot is because it's March, and I've put my foot in my mouth enough times. If they're gonna do it, that's what needs to happen: Amir Williams playing like a man possessed, and Russell going off. Chances of that? Slim at best. 




 Cool, good analysis

EDIT: I'm more than happy to have a conversation, and there's a great chance I'm wrong about a lot of things, but that's just a dumb comment. 




 Some of these whistles are straight ridiculous haha. 




 Tustin. I feel like I remember playing you guys once or twice 




 Hoping they realize lots of people are watching and take steps to correct it. 




 Dee Dee, get out of my lah-bore-ah-tore-e!

Omelet du fromageeeeeee 




 Yeppp hahah. I mean I went to Tustin, we were solid at that time but we weren't a serious contender.  




 Seriously no clue haha. 




 Amir Williams would need the game of his life, and Arizona would have to be ice cold from the field. Also I'm just assuming that anyone who picks Ohio State to win a game is assuming Russell will drop at least 25 in that game. 




 I think he was going for Cyclone but that was my first thought too lol 




 It amazes me that you have Michigan State and ND in the Final Four and only put up an 847. 




 I know that feel, we played Kawhi Leonard when he was in high school. Destroyed us. 




 They had their best player, 7 footer Robert Upshaw with NBA talent, kicked off the team in December and then nosedived into badness.

Saying they played a bunch of crappy teams and nosedived is just not knowing what happened this year at all. 




  if they aren't playing well, they can easily lose early.

I'd hope that goes without saying.. 




 Those games are 50/50. I wouldn't beat yourself up over it too much, pick the teams you like best. I have three 9s and an 8, but realistically, any of those teams can win. None of them are horrible match-ups for the other, and none of them are over or under seeded too much. 




 I have them in the Elite 8. It's not an easy road at all, but they have the best player in the regional in Kris Dunn. That's a damn useful thing 




 You mean Sweet 16? They're on the same side of the regional, they have to play before then. 




 Indeed, thanks! This is probably the thing I'll be most excited about today until the tournament starts hahaha 




 Just my thoughts haha. Look, gun to my head, I'm taking Kentucky. But those two things make Wisconsin a very tough team. That's essentially them firing on all cylinders. 




 And your 7'6" center 




 I'm not really buying the haven't faced an elite team deal. 

Wisconsin has played one elite team, Duke, who they lost to at home in a great game. 

Kentucky has played one elite team, Kansas, who they eviscerated before Kansas had really figured out how to play together. 

Virginia lost to Duke at home in a great game. 

Duke won at Virginia and at Wisconsin, easily the best two wins this season, but also lost to/played close games against teams much their inferior. 

Arizona played one, a home win against Gonzaga in OT. Gonzaga obviously played the same one.

Each of these teams, with the exception of Duke, has 1 elite game. Which half of them lost. Why does that all the sudden make them head and shoulders above Villanova? 




 They're not terrible. I don't think you guys will lose to them. But they're not terrible. 




 Fox is pushing that angle because they want to raise the value of their properties (the Big East). If everyone thinks it's a joke, no one will bother heading to FS1 to watch it. So when ESPN says the Big East is overrated, Fox needs to push back with why they would say that. 




 Oh I don't think they will beat you. They just absolutely have the talent to do so. 




 So is his last name really pronounced Toke-O-Toe like Jay Bilas and the rest of ESPN says it? I have a visceral reaction to it every time, cuz I feel like it should be pronounced Toko-Doe...

these are the things I think about 




 If Duje plays like that in the tournament and Traevon comes back and plays effectively, I might even favor you over Kentucky. Maybe. 




 It's a tough regional, but they're definitely talented enough to do it. They can match-up with anyone in the region too. 




 Both offensive juggernauts, but Gonzaga has size in a way Iowa State can't really match, would be my quick take. But Iowa State has a way of getting on these unstoppable runs. Depends what you trust. 




 Just walk around in between games and you're golden 
























 He's said he's going to graduate in June and no information has come to light refuting that, so at this point yeah.
 




 Except he's graduating in June. So he is eligible to go to the draft after next season. 




 Hope like hell he gets in the Hall. He's deserving. 




 They have to pay him, they don't have to play him. In theory they could've DFA'd him. 

There was an understanding that Josh would not be welcomed back to the team, so they spent that time trying to work it out. This is how it eventually got worked out. 




 It's not the organization's fault, but their response was "Screw you for relapsing, you can't play." It was not at all an assessment of his ability to play. It was Arte saying "You will not play for us anymore." 




 How long do you think it would take him to put out each serialized part? Gotta be like at least 9 months. 




 I see what you're saying, absolutely. I just view it as a telescoping serialization, rather than the end of serialization. Although I buy your argument. 

As a whole, you could look at the increasing popularity of series of novels as the next step in serialization. Where before we split up the same (long) book into parts, now we break up the same long series into novels.

In terms of a serialized novel, it'd have to be long enough to support the serialization, but I could imagine a scenario in which it works. I could definitely imagine something like the next Song of Ice and Fire book being serialized to great acclaim, if GRRM decided he wanted to (which there's no way in hell he will). 




 Extended spring training is considered an insult, compared to a rehab stint in the minors. At least, that's how Hamilton took it. In his eyes he's been ready to play. 




 Angels refused to let him play. He wanted to play. 




 Baseball players get paid to play. You pay them varying amounts based on the level you hope they produce at, but they get paid to play. 




 I disagree that Netflix and Hulu means the end of serialization. I'd argue the exact opposite. Netflix IS the new serialization. Look at how they release all their original content: a season at a time. Which people watch in rapid succession and then wait eagerly for the next one.

That's serialization. 




 *Infinite Jest* did that for me 




 [Tongariro by Milorad Pejic.](https://www.guernicamag.com/poetry/tongariro/)

Wish he was more widely available in English. 




 Haha I did, don't worry. You didn't say anything substantively different, unless you mean it's your opinion that Arte shouldn't be involved in player transactions. Which doesn't change the fact that that's not at all what happened here, and it's foolish to pretend like it did.  




 Angels weren't going to get anything for Hamilton because everyone knew how badly Arte wanted him gone. We had absolutely no leverage. 




 Arte is the only reason we signed Hamilton, and he's the only reason we traded him for nothing. Arte and his ego.

So no, we can't leave Arte up in the owner's box. This conversation begins and ends with him. 




 He didn't want to go to extended spring training. I haven't heard about him refusing to go on a rehab assignment in the minors..source? 




 He worked his ass off, it didn't work out. He definitely could've been a productive member of our team this year. Worth the money? Almost assuredly not. But we ran him out of town cuz our feelings got hurt that he wasn't performing. 




 I particularly enjoy the part of all this where Angels fans like to pretend Hamilton wasn't hurt all last year.

Never been so ashamed to be an Angels fan in my life. Our organization treated him horribly. 




 Major Major Major Major is amazing. 




 *Tiny Beautiful Things* really pulled me out of a bad time. 




 I'm really excited for *Slade House* by David Mitchell. Wasn't expecting new work from him so quickly. 




 Wilde was an arrogant asshat for much of his life, but you should check out *De Profundis*. He wrote it after he'd been brought low by life, and it's an incredible read. 

http://upword.com/wilde/de_profundis.html 




 His BABIP was high in part because he was crushing the ball, but yeah, it was gonna come down. I mean the dude was hitting well over .400, it would've been bananas if he didn't. 




 Beginning of last season, before he injured his thumb, he was looking really really good. 




 This. This this this this. This is honestly the lowest point of Angels fandom for me, ever. 




 Not novels strictly speaking, but a lot of Hemingway's short fiction and nonfiction is really good. *Death in the Afternoon*, *A Moveable Feast* (although you could argue that this is fictionalized) are both really good in my opinion. 




 "The time seems simpler than today, but mostly because the past always seems simpler when its wars are done." -*The Boys of Summer* by Roger Kahn

Oh I could do this all day. 




 In that vein, I find his nonfiction to be wonderful. *A Man Without A Country* and *Palm Sunday* are both great, quick, whimsical reads. 




 Basically Fitzgerald's stuff that's not Gatsby 




 That was after this: http://m.mlb.com/video/v33537087/cwslaa-trout-ties-game-with-grand-slam-off-sale

Yes I was just looking for a reason to watch it again. 




 That was the second thing I realized. 




 So stoked to watch him play this year. Oklahoma can be really really good. 




 Hahaha I was about to text this to you and then I read the username. 




 I think it was a risk we needed to take. This was Howie's last year under contract, and we'd made it clear that we weren't going to resign him. Heaney, on the other hand, is a high-ceiling starting pitching prospect, which is by far the weakest position in the organization. He broke camp in AAA, but he will be in the majors before too long if he keeps progressing. We just have options in the rotation for the first time in a long time, which is awesome for us.

Howie was a fan favorite, and it sucked to see him go, but Heaney has a chance to be a key rotation cog for years. With Weaver and Wilson starting to be on the way out, Heaney will get a shot. 




 I wish I knew. We've had some terrible BABIP and RISP luck, but the offense will come around. But the middle of our bullpen has been awful, and our rotation has been very, very meh. We just got back Richards from his knee injury, so hopefully he can adjust and settle in. Shoemaker had his first bad start in forever on Monday, and now he's on the bereavement list. Wilson has shown flashes of pretty good and really bad. Weaver had his first solid outing of the year last night, but the bullpen took it and set it on fire.

Basically, I think we'll be fine if we can get the pen sorted out. We have most of what was a really good bullpen last year, and I think our rotation can surprise people. Just not clicking yet. We tend to do this in April. Last year was our best April in awhile, and we finished the month at .500. 




 Their salaries are very much lower than what rookies make in other leagues, but with the bonuses, the money is there, and for a larger pool of players than in the other sports. Good on you for waiting to research to respond though, there's always things that we don't know and that's a good look.

The Harris poll methodology is a good representation of the current state of affairs, but no one under age 30 was polled. Where the NBA is making big gains is in the younger demographics. Those will take awhile to show up throughout the rest of the population, but in terms of predictors of future success, being popular with the under-30 demographic is a pretty strong one.

And the Bleacher Report thing doesn't have anything that shows a decline in popularity. It's just a think piece about what that dude thinks is wrong with today's NBA. 




 You mean lowest 




 Bryce Dejean-Jones was kinda bad last year. 




 Well let's pick apart just a couple of the things you said wrong.

Baseball is the only professional sport in America where you can make millions of dollars directly out of high school. High school kids get drafted in the top of the first round and sign for multimillion dollar bonuses often. Of the first 74 players picked last year, 2 didn't sign (including the number 1 overall pick, cuz he turned down a $5 million bonus after it was reduced from $6.5 million as a result of his physical); so out of the 72 that did, only 9 did not receive a 7 figure bonus. And the lowest of the bonuses was $546,100. So it's actually the quickest "get rich quick sport".

NBA popularity has not fallen off the table; it's rapidly rising in popularity. I really have no idea where you're drawing that conclusion from. Baseball is still more popular, but the NBA is coming.

 




 1984. 




 It was decently hard hit. Still close to him. Not a bad play, just not showing off any spectacular range. 




 Into the Wild shows both sides in an honest way. Which is why I think that book causes so much controversy between people who come down on one side or the other. It's like, nah man, the wonder of these things here is the tension between them. 




 Downvote the man all you want, he's right. That ball was not very far away. 




 Brendan Ryan was the best. 









 Jon Krakauer is awesome. He really drives at the intersection between modern humanity and nature in a lot of his writing I think.

John Muir's writing is incredible too. *My First Summer in the Sierras* in particular comes to mind. 




 Glad someone said this. Book is infuriating. 




 Yeah I feel like the only one out there! The weird thing about it is that I'm a really generous reader usually (I don't dislike much). I feel like I seriously just had to have missed the entire thing haha. 




 *To Kill A Mockingbird* for me. That book just never came alive to me, I really don't know what it was. I will eventually give it another shot and see if I was just in a bad mood when I initially read it. 




 Roster struggling last year? We had the best record in baseball.

Look I want us to win as much as the next guy. But deep breaths. It's been 13 games. Not even 10% of the season. 




 That commitment is conditional; the consequences of breaking that commitment are that he doesn't get a scholarship to attend Buffalo and play basketball there anymore. That's it. That's all. End of story. 

Lol that's a false comparison. Evans is doing nothing that many other players whose coaches left are doing. I agree that he hasn't necessarily handled it the best by tweeting about it, but no one in this situation has.

The precedent in this extremely-precedented situation is to block conference opponents and out-of-conference rivals, if any. That is the de-facto reasonable limitation, as determined by **the rest of the country**. By blocking more than that, you are being unreasonable, by definition. Especially considering the schools you blocked are his best options, and the places he is most likely to transfer to: where the coach he considers a father figure now works, and the two schools closest to his home.

I'd have preferred if Hurley stayed at Buffalo; I was excited to see what you guys could do with him going forward. But it happened, and acting like this in the aftermath is childish.  




 It's gotta be particularly egregious. That slide is akin to a dude realizing right after he did it that it was not the right play. Gets a yellow all the time. 




 This was my thought. I didn't realize no one knew who he was 




 Takeout slide was intentional, but not the injury, which is what you're mad about. 




 That was a yellow card slide, not a red. 




 Yost was quoting/paraphrasing Herrera when he said that. Yost says that's what Herrera was saying in the post-ejection shenanigans while he was pointing at his head. Yost wasn't offering that as his own thoughts on the matter.  




 I stand corrected in saying that he was there because of Hurley. However, Hurley did coach the two seasons he played for you, and he has referred to him publicly as a father figure.

Just because the rules allow you to do it doesn't mean it's fair at all. I'm having a hard time grasping the idea that someone actually believes that because the NCAA says it's okay, there's obviously nothing wrong with it.

He implied that, but until he has some evidence, that's all he's doing.

I know, I'm glad they lifted the blocks. Cuz it's inane to think that you should be able to control someone else's life in this manner. Sadly, the only reason they lifted the blocks is because they realized how bad it looks, not because they actually feel they were in the wrong. 




 The comments on that youtube video...like I know it's youtube comments but I still can't fathom those responses. 




 See the assumption there is that you control the player, and it's faulty as hell. The player does not have to do what you want him to. You are not "handing [Hurley] our second best player". Evans gets to decide what's best for him, not you. You do not control him, and it's petty, immature, and flat out wrong to try and block him from pursuing what he feels is his next best step. Chances are, he was only at Buffalo because of Hurley anyway. So when he leaves, you just get to control him? Bullshit. 




 Nah cuz the Angels hat only has the A on it. The A's hat has the AS that you need to start ASSHAT. If the A's and Angels switched (woo let's do that yes!), it would spell ASHAST 




 No. This was already a silly situation before that happened. Lawrie was out of line, made a dangerous slide, and got beaned for it. It happens, Lawrie was fine with it, tried to apologize for it (but did or didn't depending on who you believe). It should've been done there.

It's making a big deal out of Cain getting hit in the foot that started the merry go round again. 

I get that you guys are angry about getting hit by so many pitches, but it's really, really not about you. There seems to be this weird narrative that everyone is beaning you because they don't respect you. That's just not true. There is no concerted effort by the rest of the league to bean your team.

I'm not saying you can't be angry; you should be frustrated. It's been terrible luck. But y'all need to realize that no one cares if you feel disrespected, 'cause that's something that's entirely in your own heads. What people do care about, though, is throwing high-90s fastballs behind people's heads. 




 Thanks for sharing the link 




 I found a lot of really interesting parallels between *On The Road* and *Fight Club*, which I know sounds like the most obnoxious combo of all time to a lot of you. I'd read both before, was revisiting, and in conversation with each other you can pick up on a lot of subtext that tends to fly below the radar. 




 Those kids are just as much at risk now. 




 Also, Alan Lightman would be a good person to check out. 




 Anything by Oliver Sacks. *The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat* is a good place to start. 




 He was definitively out. You can see the glove hit Castellanos' foot. 




 I'd donate. 




 I feel the same way about being active during the day. Just started an office job and not sure I'm cut out for it. Thanks! 




 He's technically not disagreeing there haha. If anything he's agreeing. 




 Yeah I'm fine with the way it went down. Winslow is obviously amazing, and I wouldn't have had a problem with his inclusion, but there is a case to be made for leaving him off. Obviously to the voters, it was a compelling one. 




 Echoes of the 2011 ALCS 




 Where is Finnegan in that mix? The pen? 




 How'd you get into lifting freight? What do you think of it? 




 Seriously, I do this all the time.

Best find would have to be Kenzaburo Oe *Teach Us To Outgrow Our Madness* because I'd never have expected to be able to find that book anywhere in San Diego, let alone at the Goodwill.

Either that, or the time I found an Environmental Ethics textbook I'd used in one of my courses a couple years back, bought for a dollar, then took to the campus bookstore and resold for 30 haha. 




 The day that happens, you be sure and let me know. 




 Race consciousness is different from racial discrimination. But that's something a lot of America doesn't understand at the moment. 




 Far be it from me. Statistics show that this team only wins World Series Championships when we suck in April. So I'm on the short-term Tank Train 




 Yankees do the same thing by getting a bunch of lefty mashers to take advantage of the short porch in right. Angels do the same thing by getting a bunch of fly ball pitchers whose stuff will play well in big old Angels Stadium. 




 We've won 2 out of 3 series lol, we just happened to get swept in the one we lost. 




 Also, Joyce 2-for-3 with 2 BBs..that's more like it. 




 Ah gotcha. Good to know 




 Didn't realize the game was only 7 innings long. They do that at lower levels? 




 Hits with RISP? I don't know what to do with this 




 Congrats to both of you! /u/stuckinthepow too. It's a big deal to finish 




 When Hector's not walking people he's a whole nother animal 




 I love Thoreau, but I think that quote is just indicative of how this isn't some new phenomenon; people have been saying the same thing in slightly different terms forever. 




 Seemed like he was getting quite a few downvotes before the edit. 




 Yeah, his edit is kinda obnoxious, but he doesn't deserve to be downvoted off his original comment IMO. 









 I would think your word would be "Father", but I guess not haha
