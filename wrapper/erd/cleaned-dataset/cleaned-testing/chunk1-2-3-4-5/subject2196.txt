 Shame and thanks for the confirmation. Ill just have to back up a bunch of the music, even the ones I have not fully decided whether I "like" them currently or not. 




 What happened with Ozzwald and his/her youtube channel and all the associated music/remixes they made? I could not find any information other than that they are all gone.

Its a real shame at least to me because I really appreciated their Gypsy Bard remix but all I can find is a speedycake and one poor quality upload such as this. http://youtu.be/v4rNysM51kA 

sidenote: I have his original song still and I was trying to tag it with a link to his youtube upload. 
























 Thank you for the link. That should come in handy! 




 Thank you for such a thorough list! I was in a hurry when taking pictures and the tools were everywhere, so it was kind of chaotic and I appreciate you taking the time to go through them like that! 




  **Thank you for all the responses, that should be all that is needed for now. I really appreciate it.**
 

So I am in kind of a predicament where I need to sort a lot of tools in 7 days before the house I am in is being put up for sale and potentially everything in it thrown away if not removed at that time.

   My great grandpa was alive from the 1920s up until the 1990s.
A lot of this stuff I have found I know what they are. But I need to prioritize what is actually of value for keepsakes and what is not.

 I will be going back down later today to snap a few more pictures of items I missed. I would appreciate any kind of help I could get.

If you see a specific type of tool or item in the pile please circle it or identify in someway I can understand since I do not know most of what these are called.  
























   I dropped my Samsung Galaxy tab 3 in the toilet a while back. All the water should be out of the system, however while the device seems to be fully functional with some input delay that hadn't been there before, except for the whole "ten minutes to boot" deal.  
  Now this would not be too big of a problem if the device didn't already have a glitch where it would crash if plugged into a micro USB occasionally...
   I have factory restored it for the hell of it, it still connects to my desktop and I can access the device. I would appreciate any advice or suggestions. 









 I will keep that in mind, I appreciate it! 
























 EDIT 2: When I clocked in for my shift my fellow IMs and I were taken to the HR meeting room, and were finally given full descriptions of our jobs and expectations, as well as an apology of sorts.
  I was not coached, in fact things that I had fought about in the past were corrected in my favor and things should be a little more straight forward than they were.

Thank you for all your responses and feedback!

Edit:  Thank you for your advise! I have sent in a ticket and will meet with my store manager tomorrow, hopefully it will turn out okay.

Tl;Dr: I told my asst. Manager he could not force me to stay past my scheduled time, he responded that he was going to hold me for job abandonment. He should have been back more often or assisted if he wanted everything off the ground, I told him "fuck you" and he responded with "well, fuck you too". End of story so far.

Extended Version:

When I first started, there were four other IMS employees I was working with, after a 8 months I have seen about ten different IMS come and go, for a long time I was the only one and for an even longer time there was just me and the guy I was hired with.
 I have never missed a shift, and I have never been late. They have never coached me, I do my job well and I am longest to have ever stayed in this position.

My scheduled clock in - clock out is 10 pm - 7 am. We are severely understaffed with 10 stockers and two backroom IMS, as well as a asst Manager and support Manager.
The management have a bad habit of making more work than we are able to work, and then it all needs to go back up to the top steel or binned. 
Then they don't show up enough to actually explain what everything is and what needs done with it, they expect me to direct traffic and do my job, and more.

Now after my scheduled time is up I get to decide whether I want to donate my personal time to help clean up the store, I had a assistant store manager when I first started who used to force us to stay, he even said, and I quote, "no, you can go when I say you can go." We stayed over two hours past scheduled clock out time because of that regularly back then. 

My current manager just tried to do that and the tl:dr sums up the rest.

Any advice on how to recover and cope with the upcoming problems, I am planning on talking to the new store owner about this really soon.

Thank you in advance. 




 Thank you for the quick response! I agree due to the additional XP drain when trying to level using Carrier/Helios. 




 However I cant seem to find any mention anywhere in the patch notes and I was wondering if this had been awhile ago or not... Thanks in advance! 
























 Thank you, that is incredibly helpful. I am going to try to arrange a meeting right now. 




 He was trying to force me to stay past my clock out time, when I am in a good mood I will volunteer time to help clean up and do more work, they will have me burn off the overtime later as a result. If he had actually asked me, it wouldn't have been as big of a deal. 




 Thank you for the response, luckily there were a few people around, including my fellow IMS co-worker, so I should be covered as far as witnesses go.
