 Depends on how we would handle drug addiction as a health issue. If we handled it as a personal responsibly issue like cigarettes and alcohol, it would cost us a lot less, probably even generate income in tax revenue.

 So, is no one going to mention the fact that the country **with** Universal Health Care has the **Lower** taxes?
