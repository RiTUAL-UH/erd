 If he's gaming, he won't see the 30$ difference in the 6000 series.  It performs about 3% better in games than the 4300.  Also,  in response to not witty, the gtx 760 is nearly equivalent to a gtx 670. Your CPU is probably bottle necking your 760 slightly, but it's nothing that would be noticeable and I wouldn't go buy a new CPU over it. 




 Pcpartpicker.com is probably the site.

My general rule is:
CPU: if your using a gtx 760 or above go intel (4670k or 4770k are great CPUs)

If you go with a budget CPU anything up to a 660ti, go with the amd phnom ii x4 965 be or fx 4000 series.

Gpu:  if you are going to do 3 1080p monitors or go with one 1440p monitors, go with 2 gtx 760s in sli. If you are using one 1080p monitor, something from amd should suffice.

The gtx 760 has the best price/performance ratio at the moment and you can sli 3 of them. They also have a very high frame buffer so you won't notice microstuttering much. 2 gtx 760's in sli perform better than a gtx Titan for 500$ less.

Storage: Samsung 840 pro series for ssd.  Western digital caviar black for hdd.  I personally go for raid 0 hard drives over one ssd, so I have storage (2tb vs 128gb-256gb) and some speed to go along with it. 

Monitors: yamakasi cat leap. Find it on eBay, best value for a 120hz monitor.

If you need more help, go to the forums on pcpartpicker and go to partlistopinions wanted. I'm a regular on that sub forum and a lot of other people would be glad to help you :)!

 Yes, there are hardly any IDE interface ssd's and at that, it does not utilize the full speed of an ssd. You will have to buy another sata3 cable. 




 Just search on google for windows 8.1 ISO. You can download it straight from the Microsoft website and load the ISO file into bootcamp. This is good until January. 




 Windows 8.1 is free right now. 




 As an AT T customer, i get a constant 20mbps down speed on my uverse line. Also with wireless, i enjoy having the ability to use data while talking on the phone simultaneously. Something other carriers can not provide. (try to call somebody and then go to google if you are on verizon and make sure your wifi is off).  I live almost right under an at t tower and get 35-40mbps lte data :). 




 Belmont? 




 You can say all you want but it is inconsiderate of people around you that have to get up and go to work in the morning with less than 5 hours of sleep. The mother and the person that used ignorant words like "fuck and hell" in his story length paragraph is unacceptable. If you have a child with mental disabilities, you should think about people around you. 




 It's called boot camp. And you get windows 8.1 for free until January.

 The pentium being a dual core, yes it would put a good limit on the 760s capabilities. I would go with at least a 3220 (it's a dual core with hyperthreading) if you are on a tight budget. 
























 Stuff like that takes a crazy amount of time to render on consumer class desktops.  




 Pickles are cucumbers. I found this out 2 years ago. 




 Is it me, or does it seem like gaming companies are taking advantage of reddit for cheap advertising? 




 Am I the only one that is amazed at how well he said that guys name at the beginning of the video?

I have yet to get a response. 




 Hey reddit, i have just started trying to learn after effects. I downloaded a template on youtube and played around with it for fun. But my question is, how can i get the rain to continue through the whole video? It cuts off when the text appears. Thanks for the help, it really means a lot to me as a beginner.

 Yeah, definitely go with the 7770ghz. Go to pcpartpicker.com and filter the gpu selection out and it will find you the lowest price. 




 What is your budget? The best value for a gpu right now is the gtx 760 for the 200-300 dollar price range(if you SLI 2 of them together, it is a great deal more powerful than the 780.). If you want something sub 100 dollar range, get the 7770 ghz edition. The ghz edition ironically goes for less most of the time than the regular 7770. If you aren't looking for cuda cores for programs that will utilize them (adobe after effects, photoshop, fireworks, etc.) or are wanting to sli 2 or more gpus together then go amd. The 7770ghz pulls about 60 fps on high on battlefield 3 with buffs like anti-aliasing turned down. Hope i helped you out. 





























 What happened to the mega box project Kim said would be out Q2 this year? I was really interested in that music service and I really wish they would have released it. 




 Sony knows advertising. [The feels this brings back.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZkMdi3XBhw list=FLFjXwg3udgBSHYy_doiGkgg)

 Yeah it's bold and it's good. Att next and other pay monthly per device plans are actually a good thing that has been implemented. They are a good deal. Websites say it isn't because they are factoring in your monthly bill for service and data, but you can not count that because you would be paying that any way.  




 As a samsung fan, I feel disgusted. First it was the fake benchmark scores (geekbench being one of them) and now fake web comments. I know all companies do it a little but for samsung to be caught in the act, means they were doing a lot more than their share. Samsung makes a much more powerful phone than anybody else, but where is the backbone?

 Mobile versions of any site are annoying. Use the full desktop version.
 
























 Michael from vSauce, is that you? 




 It might not sound like much to you, but instead think about 999,999 playstation 4's.  




 I just wish they still had the service for $7.99 a month. 




 There is actually a way. It is very simple now because apple removed DRM from all of their songs about 2 years ago. All you have to do now is plug in your android to the computer, find where your itunes songs are stored on your computer (if they arent downloaded, download them first) and just click and drag to the music file of your android device. Album art and metadata comes with each file as well. 




 How do the cars park/drive off (second picture)? 




 That FPS Master controller, it actually seems like it would help. 




 I am learning this program by myself. But i have a question. [Here is the image im trying to reproduce in cad](http://i458.photobucket.com/albums/qq304/gwidas2000/steeringbush1kk9.jpg)

I made the 54 line, but how do i make the 36 line perfectly centered in between the 54 line?
I'm going to add the circles later after i get the lines made. Thanks.

Edit: you don't have to be in a university to use this, it also works for k-12. The only downside is that it expires in 3 years.
studica.com sells perpetual licenses (they never expire) for design suite and entertainment suite ($22,000 combined) for $500.
