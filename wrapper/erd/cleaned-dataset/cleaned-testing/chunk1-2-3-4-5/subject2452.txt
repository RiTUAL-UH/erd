 ....um, racrenlew I see what you mean now after looking back up at what I wrote but I didn't write that. I didn't write a lot of the things that are showing up in my post. I tried to write [11:4-9] which I felt really uncomfortable even trying to write once. 




 Wait, what bible verse? I didn't write a single thing related to the bible at all. 









 I think it's funny that movies always have a part where somebody says don't go looking for trouble or you won't like what you find when someone starts digging for info. It's funny because nobody does that in the real world so finding something out is almost always super easy. People love to gossip, right? It fills the gaps in boring work conversations and makes daily life seem way more interesting. You all do it, don't even deny it.

The problem is when everybody that's sharing the same gossip has a minor detail that's different in their version. Like who the fuck was your source? Why would anybody change the story? It's usually never a very interesting detail anyway.

That's not the issue here though. This time not one of the answers was even the same. So let me start from the beginning.

About a year ago, I moved into a really fucking sweet apartment on the outskirts of **[74686520636f6e667573696f6e206f6620746f6e67756573]**. I'm sure you all know that the rent here is cheaper the farther out you go. (if you don't, there's a little pro-tip for you, free of charge) The buildings usually look like they should be out of your price range too, but they're not. I got extra lucky at my place with a corner loft on the top floor with a vaulted ceiling that stretches really high so the whole thing is super spacious and comfy. Or it would be comfy if it weren't for the construction behind the apartment. It started about 3 months after I moved in and hasn't really stopped since. It seems like all hours of the day I hear stupid trucks beepin and boopin all over the place, hauling things from one end of the construction site to the other. The sound of the steel girders clanking in to each other is the worst part though. That awful boom of metal against metal. It became so consistent that I couldn't resist the urge to find out how much longer it was gonna take.

So last Monday I get to the office I work at and start asking around about this building that's going up. I started with **[61206c6f737420736f756c]** in the cubicle across from me.
Oh yeah, it's going to be a hospital.
Then I asked **[61206c6f737420736f756c]** three cubicles away.
My brother and I were just talking about that yesterday. He's positive it's going to be a plastic manufacturing company but I heard it was going to be another Microsoft building. he said.
I finished off my rounds with **[61206c6f737420736f756c]** on 5th that says it's going to be a law firm and the secretary on the main floor that heard on the news it was some up and coming web marketing agency. It was strange but I figured somebody was bound to say the same thing as someone else eventually and then maybe I'd have my answer.

I went over to my friend's place after work to play smash bros and we invited over a few more people to even the odds since he was way better than me (thank you internet for keeping me anonymous because I would never say that to his face). Once **[61206c6f737420736f756c]** and **[61206c6f737420736f756c]** got there, I started up again about the building. I was sure **[61206c6f737420736f756c]** knew because he was an editor for the local paper but even he told me that nobody he worked with could get a solid fact down. More than that, none of the journalists could even get ahold of anyone to ask about it's progress.

Flash forward to today; it all got so much weirder and became the major reason why I'm writing this in the first place. I didn't notice it until just a couple of days ago but they've started removing the steel girders and have instead started building up the main elevator shaft in the center of it all.
Here's a picture I took yesterday: [tower photo 1](http://i.imgur.com/4yb0WxY.jpg)

You can see by the tilt of the rope in that photo that the girder is swinging away from the building. I'm not making this shit up! They're removing everything they worked on for the last year and have switched to working on the elevator only, like some kind of giant tower.

I was confused and a little freaked out when I realized what was happening so after taking the picture I went over there to ask questions but everyone spoke really broken English and every time I stopped someone they just yelled and kept walking. It made sense, I probably wasn't supposed to be walking around inside the gated area anyway. It was getting late and I was getting nowhere, but just as I was giving up and started heading back to my apartment, I noticed a single lone sign off to the left of the entrance that read **[5,433 Cubits and 2 Palms Tower]**. Now that I'd thought about it, this was the only sign in the entire construction site. There weren't even any labels on any tools or work trailers. The porta-potties didn't even have labels! Seriously, like every company gets their porta-potties from the same place so that didn't even seem possible. After looking more closely at the sign I noticed **[11:4-9]** was scribbled in red marker all across the bottom. I knew nobody affiliated with this construction could've wrote the bottom part because it was too rude (even for construction workers) to be on public display and actually made me a little uncomfortable to be standing so close to something so graphic. I left quickly after that.

Now I had a name but I needed to know more, I decided to go back that night after midnight. Here's a picture closer up from when I got there: [tower photo 2](http://i.imgur.com/y4FajHi.jpg)

I walked along the side of the wire fence until I came to the truck gate. I thought I'd have to hop it but it swung open with the slightest push. This was unreal, it shouldn't be this easy to get inside something like this at night. I kept going until I came to a decline in the dirt leading into a basement entrance to the building. Here's are some pictures of the basement entrance area: [tower photo 3](http://i.imgur.com/6favdIT.jpg)

[tower photo 4](http://i.imgur.com/JtZxYB0.jpg)

As you can see, there was a single light on in the back. I stopped abruptly when I noticed it but there shouldn't have been anybody at the construction site this late so I assumed somebody had just forgotten to turn the light off. I slowly started up again on my way down the path when suddenly I heard a box fall deep inside the building with an echo that I swear to god couldn't have been as big as it was. It sounded like it came out of a football stadium. No, that's not even big enough. It was like it bounced off the side of a mountain or deep within a canyon except it was inside! It sent a chill down my spine that forced me to turn back and just as I did, out of the corner of my eye I'm fucking sure I saw a huge beastly face that looked just like **[546865206f6e65207468617420736c656570732062656c6f77 ]** barely illuminated by the light of the room just behind it. From what I could tell in that instant, it was completely motionless. Just watching from afar.

I screamed and sprinted all the way from the basement entrance back to the front door of my apartment. I knew what I really saw had to be the silhouette of what was likely just boxes fueled by adrenaline and that effect being alone in the dark late at night has on you. I started to feel a little better from working that part out. Then just as easily as I got my pulse to slow it sped right back up as I remembered that something had to make that box fall and if it was a person, I'm sure they would've seen me and called after me to get off the property, right? So what the hell was it? What the hell is this building? I couldn't go to the police because they'd know I shouldn't have been there in the first place. I don't want to, but I need to go back tomorrow. I need to know who's building **[5,433 Cubits and 2 Palms Tower]** and why.

Somebody please look back at the pictures and tell me if you see the thing I described in the darkness. I doubt you can see anything because the photos are so dark but I'm too freaked out right now to verify anything myself. I plan to bring my laptop and a better camera with me tomorrow so hopefully I can update right on the spot.

 holy fuck! Wait, what's hexadecimal? Is that a math thing? Anyway, thanks for looking that stuff up because I was having a hard time deciphering it. What weirds me out is why would the hacker/author change the name from satan to the one that sleeps below and when did he do it? I've made a few grammatical edits already so he must have managed to slip it in at some point. but yeah, if he/she's trying to freak me out, there's no reason to change it because I get the idea and I've been freaking out this whole fucking time. You mentioned the confusion of tongues, maybe he's having trouble finding the right words? Fuck, I don't know enough about this stuff. also I don't mean to burden you but do you think you could decipher my name? Every time I type it (and I'm assuming this time will be the same) it comes out as [666f756e6420796f75] 




 and that was my name. I tried editing it and writing it a few different ways but it always comes out as a different combination than any other name I write. This is messed up. 




 Okay, I was just testing it, any time I  try to write a name I get the same thing...[666f756e6420796f75] 




 [61206c6f737420736f756c] [61206c6f737420736f756c] [61206c6f737420736f756c] [61206c6f737420736f756c] [61206c6f737420736f756c] 




 What the hell! I'm pegging this on a hacked account. Maybe it's a weird ad-bot thing that's replacing my text on submitting it? I don't really get why the text is so weird though.

 Im sure many of you have been to a newly remodeled McDonalds. Possibly one with a McCafe. 

But have you ever looked up why they started remodeling the restaurants in the first place? 

The first McCafe in the states popped up in Chicago back in May of 2001. That was just the beginning. 

Now over the last five years, McDonalds has taken to remodeling every single restaurant in America. Most of you might even be asking yourself how long its been since you last stepped foot in an old McDonalds.

Ask anyone whos done some market research and youll hear something strange. McDonalds loses money on the process. Its a fact. The new furniture isnt pulling new customers and the McCafes cant sell coffee that cheap and turn a profit. Look at Starbucks prices and youll see what I mean. 

Stakeholders say they wanted a more adult vibe for the restaurant. A classier look for a classier America. 

Wrong answer. Google it right now: whats McDonalds target age group? Its children and teens. It always has been. 

So then why did they start all these remodels? Why would one of the largest corporations in America spend over 1 billion on a terrible marketing strategy?

Thats where things get interesting. 

Lets start with the play places.

If you can remember, almost no two play places at McDonalds were identical. Some of them were really fun. I know I had a few favorites. 

Well some of them were also really dangerous. The first gem I could find was a carousel play place in Lancaster, Pennsylvania back in the 1980s that got shut down mere months after opening. Little information was given about why they closed. The lot has been vacant ever since. 

If you find the right connections in Lancaster though, you just might be able to read an article that didnt make it to print. 

Children would play on the merry-go-round in ways they werent supposed to, you see. Theyre kids, so of course they would. Well one day a few kids managed to crawl underneath the thing but then they never made it back out. 

The whole incident was so heavily guarded by McDonalds PR, youd be troubled to find a single person that was even there that whole afternoon. The only witness anyone could find had this to say:

When they went under, a few parents started calling for help. Then something happened to the lights. The carousel kept getting brighter and the music was deafening. I ran out of the building when the machine started to smoke, but I looked back through the window to see if the kids were alright and [the employees] were just standing there behind the registers! They looked like they were still waiting for customers!

Weirder and weirder stories pick up from there through the years. Reports of children sinking into ball pits that should only be a foot deep. Mothers searching play tubes for their kids, only to find a lonely pair of shoes.

But the play places held a mere fraction of the incidents.

Back in 1996 in Knoxville, Tennessee there was a business man of his 40s who went into a McDonalds restroom and remained there for seven hours. Patrons noted that he refused to leave the furthest back stall.

The police were finally called and they managed to break down the door. He was restrained by paramedics as he wouldnt willingly leave the restroom. 

As they pulled him out of the stall he began screaming bloody murder take me back! I want to go back! but the moment he exited the restaurant he passed out. He had no memory of ever going to a McDonalds the day of the incident. 

The restaurant was shut down before anyone could inspect the stall he had shut himself in. However, anyone who used the restroom that day mentioned hearing several voices whispering things like:

It wasnt him.

We have to go back

Saw you smile.

Then there was a fry cook somewhere in Vermont back in 99 who walked into the middle of the restaurant and dumped scalding oil on himself without flinching or saying a word. Several of the customers started to laugh and roll around in the burning oil alongside him and all were rushed to the hospital. Only one survived but refuses to make a statement. Not that she easily could. Her throat melted all the way through and had to be completely restructured.

The manager claimed he didnt remember ever hiring the fry cook and that he wasnt in any official paperwork. His name tag didnt even have a name, just #### written on it. Once again, the McDonalds was closed without a trace.

Most of the stories sounded like urban legends to me but it never failed. Wherever I found a story, a McDonalds had been shut down in its wake.

Near the late 2000s the number of cover ups had become so frequent that McDonalds decided to shut all of them down and rebuild. Every. Single. One.

But of course theyd miss a few.

I needed to see one for myself. I remember going in the old McDonalds as a kid but that was before the frequency of the incidents. That was when it was still safe.

There was a small town on the way to my parents house just off the highway. Oroska was its name. Maybe a hundred residents. Completely untouched by the outside world, practically forgotten. It was pointless to stop there for any normal reason because there wasnt a gas station or rest stop. Not even a sign to let you know you were close. 

Lets just say I had to sneak my way around some very old building permits to discover that they had one of the few McDonalds (aside from some treasured landmarks) that has yet to go through a remodel since the 1970s. How lucky is that? I was surprised they even had a fast food place, yet they didnt have a market or post office.

I planned a trip to my parents place for the weekend, with a stop at Oroska on the way. It was already dark out since it was the dead of winter and I didnt get off work till 5. I was cold and grumpy about driving at night, but mostly determined. 

I dont think I wouldve ever found the place before phone GPS, the turn off from the highway was just a dirt road with no landmarks or anything. As I pulled into town not a single one of the few scattered houses had lights on. Most of the street lights were out as well, as though nobody had remembered to change the bulbs in years. This place really was untouched. Id be surprised if most (if not all) of the residents hadnt moved out or simply died off. It definitely had the makings of a ghost town anyway. 

I was about to lose hope when I finally saw it. The nauseous yellow light of those golden arches barely illuminating a vacant parking lot in the distance. It buzzed and flickered like a fly zapper running out of batteries. The sign below said eat new eggs mc-uffin. We like to saw you smile. Which I assumed was just a lazy teens handy-work. I pulled into the lot and carelessly parked my car in the center (there was nobody else there anyway). 

When I stepped out of my car, I felt a squish under my foot. There was a burger covered in mold with a rancid liquid oozing out. The smell was absolutely vomit worthy. I jumped out to scrape the contents of the burger from my shoe when I noticed the whole parking lot was covered in trash. There were half eaten boxes of fries and sun baked childrens toys spilling out of old greased up McDonalds bags. Everything was camouflaged by a layer of dirt and snow like it had been here for months, possibly years. 

I hurried across the lot to avoid retching all over the asphalt. As I approached the door I noticed the windows were caked in dust. Somebody had taped a piece of paper to the door with the word CLOSED scribbled across it in red marker, yet the sign hung from the inside clearly said open and all the lights were on. Cautiously I approached the door and pushed. 

An artificial bell hummed an old McDonalds tune that fizzled out on the last few notes as the door creaked open. I looked around the fluorescent lit room and saw it was void of life. There was nobody sitting at any of the tables and nobody attending the registers. Somebody had left a tray on one of the tables in the back but there was no other sign someone had been here. 

The inside was at least a little cleaner. The toys on display by the counter were of characters Id never heard of, likely from before my time. The whole place was covered in faded coats of yellow and red paint and all the tables had that classic McDonalds wood finish. The wood looked completely rotten, but slathered in coats of polish as a sad attempt to keep it looking new. All of it had a sort of green hue which I contributed to the old lights. The most noticeable element, though, was a terrible burning plastic smell that stung my nose.

I went up to the register. If anyone was even here, I felt like I shouldnt order anything but I was hoping maybe I could ask someone a few questions.

I waited for a good 15 minutes in silence. I shouted hello with only a muted echo for a response. I had been to a few McDonalds with bad service in the past but this was insane. With how dirty the whole place was I shouldve expected as much.

Just as I was about to turn around and give up, the cash register popped open. It was practically begging me to take a tip for myself. Besides, didnt I deserve a slight reward for wasting my time here? I casually walked over to it and saw at least a dozen 20s stacked high. 

Looking around to make sure nobody was watching, I reached in to take a few bills when the thing suddenly snapped closed right on my fingers. The metal dug deep into my flesh leaving a dark trail of blood down the side of the counter. I yelped in pain.

Behind the counter at the other end of the grill was a first aid kit hanging on the wall. The lights were burned out in the kitchen area but I needed a bandage, pronto. I hopped over the table and made my way to the back. The burning smell was getting stronger as I walked. I noticed the grill was covered in a thick layer of grease, completely unsuitable for cooking. I passed by the frying station and the oil was filled to the top with maggots.

I quickened my walk to the first aid hoping to get patched up and out of there as soon as possible. I was starting to realize that this restaurant definitely wasnt open for business anymore and I probably shouldnt have entered it in the first place. I opened up the first aid kit and had to swallow some vomit. 

A cloud of mold burst out from it in every direction followed by the same bubbling black ooze that was on the burger outside. I started coughing and waving my hands in the air to clear the mold dust floating around.

The same bell I heard playing that McDonalds tune started up again as I steadied myself. I assumed it was broken like the rest of this dump. I looked back toward the counter and noticed everything seemed farther away. I must have been disoriented from losing blood and that awful smell. I looked down at my hand to see how bad the wound was and my eyes widened. There was no wound on my hand at all.

I rushed back towards the counter in a panic when something under the stove caught my foot and I fell. In the darkness my eyes started to adjust and I saw the outline of a body. Somebody was under there. Maybe they were unconscious and needed help! I yanked at the persons arm and a half decayed body slid out across the floor. 

They were wearing a McDonalds employee shirt with a nametag that read ####. Their mouth was contorted into a sickening grin but their eyes were screaming. I tried to shout but no sound came out like when trying to wake up from a nightmare. As I scrambled to get back up to the counter, the lights had started to dim and the McDonalds tune was getting louder, the notes fizzling and distorting as they played.

Once I had gotten my grip above the counter, I froze. 

Since entering, I never looked at the side of the restaurant opposite the counter. There was a play place.

The glass separating the main restaurant from the play area had hundreds of bloody handprints smearing down toward the floor. The tube slide was caved in with chunks of red liquid spurting out from the tiny hole left at the bottom. There was a row of nooses tied to the monkey bars in the corner with employees wearing the same #### nametags hanging from them. The tables around the perimeter had skeletons with rotting food left on trays, some of the food hanging from the skulls mouthes. I looked on in horror, too shocked to move. 

While the rest of the restaurant went dark, a bulb in the center of the play place continued to glow like a carnival spotlight. Below it was a massive ball pit, barely able to contain all of its colored plastic balls. It was smoking under the blaring white light, making that awful burning plastic smell. 

The balls began to rattle and fall off the edge when something inside started shuffling around. I wanted to run so badly but my body refused. Then suddenly the music went dead and the movement stopped. 

A yellow glove slowly crept upward from the pit below, writhing its fingers as it went. A connected red and white sleeve came after it, slowly alternating colors as they appeared from underneath. The arm continued to reach toward the sky, growing more and more, while its joints popped and cracked like breaking branches. By the end that arm had to be at least six feet long. 

It finally reached for the lit bulb on the ceiling with its gangly gloved fingers and began to twist it loose.

I broke into a sprint, jumping over the counter and toppling chairs as I went. That last light went out just as I got to the exit. I bashed
through the door, breaking the glass in the process. As I rolled into the parking lot I heard a distant scream, and then something whispered right next to my ear in dead silence. It had the same tinny distortion as the McDonalds tune

Come back. I want to see you smile.

I havent told anyone about what happened there that night. There was an article online saying Oroska burned to the ground a few days later. I dont know if it was a cover up or something else, but Im never going back to find out.

I didnt share this because I want you to get involved, by the way. I shared it to warn you what happens when you do. 

You can go to a new McDonalds, keep getting your Big Macs, get your McCafe coffee, thats fine. They did something to the remodels to make them safe, at least for now. 

But dont ever go into an old McDonalds. Not even the drive thru. 









 For those of you not up to speed, you can read part 1 of what's happening [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2e98vp/palms_tower/) 

Okay, so I woke up in my bed just a few minutes ago with no recollection of how I got back here, turned my laptop on that luckily survived the events of the night before and have started typing this latest addition. I can't recall anything after passing out yesterday...or I guess its still today. I'm really turned around because It's I know it's been a full day and night since I last updated and so much has happened but my computer calendar, reddit, and everything else is claiming its still 8/22/2014 which is only two days after my first visit to **[5,433 Cubits and 2 Palms Tower]**. That shouldn't be possible!

So before I get into things, I need to thank user kamafr for deciphering the text on my last entry. After looking back over the article I noticed that wherever I tried to type a formal noun of any kind like a friend's name or a location or whatever, something was changing the text. I don't know if my account got hacked or what. I hear about that happening way too often on posts like this to assume anything else but the text it changed to actually seems relevant. So yeah, here's what he found out: 
**[18 19 14 15    13 14 22.    5 8 13 3    19 7 4 18 4    22 14 17 3 18    0 13 3    8    18 7 0 11 11    5 8 13 3    24 14 20,    18 15 4 0 10    19 7 4 18 4    22 14 17 3 18    0 13 3    8    18 7 0 11 11    5 8 13 3    24 14 20    18 14 14 13 4 17.    2 11 14 0 10 4 3    8 13    18 10 8 13,    8    18 19 4 0 11    0 22 0 24    8 13 19 14    24 14 20 17    17 14 14 12    0 13 3    2 20 19    24 14 20 17    19 14 13 6 20 4    5 17 14 12    24 14 20 17    19 7 17 14 0 19    0 13 3    15 20 19    24 14 20    8 13    19 7 4    15 8 19    22 8 19 7    19 7 4    14 19 7 4 17 18.    3 14    13 14 19    18 4 4 10    19 7 4    19 17 20 19 7.]**

So basically **[5,433 Cubits and 2 Palms Tower]** is actually **[G + R 11:4-9]**. Before the events of this last week, this wouldn't have seemed possible to me but now I really think it's true.

I'm about to show you the pages I wrote before and during my most recent visit to the tower. I know you're not going to believe any of it and I know I have trouble with it myself, but this is the only place I know where someone out there might find some semblance of truth and take it as a warning. I've been shaking like crazy the whole time I'm writing this because the things I saw just weren't possible and I don't exactly know why I'm still alive. Something is happening and I think you all need to be ready for it. Nobody nearby seems to notice it like I do but maybe whatever's affecting them hasn't reached any of you yet. Let's get started

5:30 PM 8/22/2014

UPDATE! Holy fuck update! So it was my last day at this internship before starting back up the fall semester and I wanted one last picture of the place to remind me how kick ass this job was. I went up to our lounge room on the 6th floor and decided to take a nice shot of the fireplace with our sunny little balcony in the background. The view was kind of bleh since there was more construction in the background here as well (like I needed another reminder) but I didn't care because it was still a really cool place. I noticed that the lighting was really bad in the first pic I took, as you can see here: [work photo 1](http://i.imgur.com/n6epR1B.jpg)

So I decided to take another shot. Here's the picture: [work photo 2](http://i.imgur.com/hRiioJ4.jpg)

I had to do a double take to make sure I wasn't seeing things. There's no way it could be there! My apartment is very far south of where I work and the balcony faces the north side. Then I looked even closer. My apartment complex was suddenly to the left of the building. In the time it took me to take a single photo, the layout of several key parts of the city have changed. From what I can tell, just the central area of my apartment complex has moved to the northern lot of town along with that...that thing. That awful, awful tower! I don't even know what happened to what was there before it. I know I went to school with a girl that lived up in that area and I hope to god she's okay. I screamed at my coworkers to look and they all thought I was crazy like it had just been there the whole time. Not a single person realized what had happened or even that the building was never there to begin with. I began to wonder why was I able to remember where it used to be? Or more-so, why did it let me remember? Why is it following me?

I'm going to head home from work and update you all on my plan of action. I should just escape while I can, I've got nobody to turn to anyway. The cops would think I was crazy, and my friends aren't any better about helping me in a pinch. Ugh, I wish **[6120736176656420736f756c]** was still around. He was the only friend I had that always had my back. I don't want to get all sappy so I'll just say he isn't with us anymore. Ugh, I need to stop thinking for awhile. Be back later.

8:00 PM 8/22/2014

I'd been pacing the room for the last couple hours trying to decide if I'm going to go in there and if I do, how do I log everything. I caved and decided to go. I was also going to go with my original plan of bringing my laptop with me to type stuff down while I'm there. I really don't want to sit in that fucking building for any length of time, but I know if something happens, at least my text will be out there. There's a chance somebody might find it someday and do something with it and I need to take that chance. I decided to pack for extreme circumstances. I'm not some idiot in a horror movie, this is real and I'm not about to make any dumb decisions. I gathered together plenty of food in case I somehow got trapped (I mean the building was unfinished), a flashlight with extra batteries, my laptop, an extra battery for my laptop, a camera, my phone, a few basic tools (big fucking hammer, screwdriver, etc.), plenty of rope and a knife from the kitchen. I hope I wouldn't need it but I'm being cautious. This is it, there's nothing more to it. I'm going. I'll post another update later.

10:00 PM 8/22/2014
I made it in to the basement. The gate was still unlocked although this time much harder to swing open as if it were rusted over. On my way in, I was worried that whatever I saw last time would be back again but so far I haven't seen anything. The light in the back room was still on, flickering a little, and what it lit up was just a storage area for cement mixers, some tools, and a bunch of unmarked boxes. Possibly one of the boxes that fell and made that ungodly distant echo. The strange thing this time around though was that every sound I made seemed stiff and compressed without a single echo at all. The air was stale and hot as though I'd been sitting in a smaller room for a long time with the door closed. Beyond here was a hallway that lead into a series of other hallways all musty and unfinished but still dimly lit. Perhaps they kept the lights on at night as a safety protocol? I dunno. I walked down the halls for a bit and here are some phone pics of what I saw: [basement photo 1](http://i.imgur.com/mYX066Z.jpg) [basement photo 2](http://i.imgur.com/mJx7oPQ.jpg)

The interior looked really beat up for having been a new building but I've never worked in construction so I have no idea what unfinished buildings are supposed to look like. Sorry for the poor picture quality, by the way. I wasn't ready to pull out my nicer camera yet since it has a pretty short battery life and I think I'll save that for whatever I find higher up. I managed to find a staircase and I've decided to take a break to write this out before I continue up. As I'm typing this I keep hearing creaks in the metal above. I'm hoping it's just the wind. Another update coming.

10:49 PM 8/22/2014

I can't believe it's taken me 45 minutes to get up these stairs, and I'm still not done! I wasn't counting floors or anything but there's no way I'm not up to the top by now! I had to take a break because I'm so out of breath so I decided to make an update. There isn't much light up here anymore and my flash is wigging out so I had to take a night vision shot on my camera: [Elevator shaft stairs](http://i.imgur.com/flA0INc.jpg)

 I can't even see the bottom anymore. It's getting pretty cold up here too and I think it started storming outside because I keep hearing these booming sounds all up and down the stairs. I have to keep going though, I won't be satisfied until I get to the top. I really hope there's an answer waiting for me there.

12:11 AM 8/23/2014

This is impossible. I haven't seen any windows so I have no way of knowing but this is definitely impossible. I'm still climbing the stairs. I'm scared out of my mind because I know I've gone up at least 20, 30, maybe even 40 or 50 floors and that tower had to be 15 floors tops. I'm so tired and so cold and nothing makes any sense. I'm going to go a little further and if I don't find something soon I need to head back. I can already tell my sanity must be slipping because the giant mountain-sized echoes are coming back and they get a little louder with every step I take. I've also started seeing movement in the stairs below when I peer over the edge. I could just barely make out some features but it almost looked like **[18 15 8 11 11    19 7 4 8 17    1 11 14 14 3    14 13    19 7 4    18 19 0 8 17 18.    4 21 4 17 24 14 13 4.]** with grinning teeth. I know it's just my mind playing tricks on me but I'm going to start going again because the longer I stay here the worse the illusions get.

12:30 AM 8/23/2014

I just reached...whatever floor I reached, and it's different. Not by much, but it's different. The floor extends a little beyond the square area of the staircase into a small room in the corner. There isn't much in here besides some very old wires and a pile of junk on the floor. I got the flash working again on my camera so I took a picture: 
[extra room](http://i.imgur.com/kXLXAW6.jpg)

As you can see, the structure of the room doesn't really match the rest of the building architecture. It's all made with brick and looks far too old to have just been built. Stranger yet is a folder in the pile of junk on the floor. It's dated 2/11/95 so this file is 19 years old. It's possible that this junk was just brought up here for whatever reason but that still doesn't explain how old everything looks. Something isn't adding up and I need to find out what that something is. I need to keep going because even as I type I can feel eyes watching me like the walls are alive or something. I almost thought I heard someone say **[8    2 0 13    18 4 4    24 14 20    19 7 17 14 20 6 7    19 7 4    18 2 17 4 4 13.    19 7 4    20 13 2 14 13 5 20 18 4 3    0 17 4    5 8 17 18 19    19 14    5 0 11 11.]** If I don't make it to the top quickly I'm going to have a mental break down.

2:45 AM 8/23/2014

I finally made it to the top and it's so much bigger than anything I've ever seen. There's so many corridors leading on and on forever. Some of the rooms I don't even want to walk in to because they don't look like they end. The walls are covered in **[6 20 19    24 14 20    20 13 19 8 11    24 14 20    18 19 14 15    18 2 17 4 0 12 8 13 6]** and it just keeps going on like that from wall to wall. I can't imagine how any of this even got here. It's so hard to type with all the ringing from that echoing. The echo just keeps going and doesn't ever stop. I think the thing is catching up, I can smell **[0    13 4 22    11 14 17 3    7 0 18    17 8 18 4 13] getting stronger. I'm going to walk and type. Hopefully it doesn't [8    0 12    12 0 12 12 14 13.    8    5 4 11 11    0 13 3    18 14    7 0 21 4    8    1 20 8 11 19    5 17 14 12    1 4 11 14 22.    8    22 8 11 11    2 11 0 8 12    0 11 11    19 7 8 13 6 18    8 13    12 24    14 22 13    13 0 12 4 18.        19 7 4 18 4    7 0 21 4    15 14 22 4 17    19 14    18 7 20 19    7 4 0 21 4 13,    19 7 0 19    8 19    17 0 8 13    13 14 19    8 13    19 7 4    3 0 24 18    14 5    19 7 4 8 17    15 17 14 15 7 4 2 24:    0 13 3    7 0 21 4    15 14 22 4 17    14 21 4 17    22 0 19 4 17 18    19 14    19 20 17 13    19 7 4 12    19 14    1 11 14 14 3,    0 13 3    19 14    18 12 8 19 4    19 7 4    4 0 17 19 7    22 8 19 7    0 11 11    15 11 0 6 20 4 18,    0 18    14 5 19 4 13    0 18    19 7 4 24    22 8 11 11.    0 13 3    22 7 4 13    19 7 4 24    18 7 0 11 11    7 0 21 4    5 8 13 8 18 7 4 3    19 7 4 8 17    19 4 18 19 8 12 14 13 24,    19 7 4    1 4 0 18 19    19 7 0 19    0 18 2 4 13 3 4 19 7    14 20 19    14 5    19 7 4    1 14 19 19 14 12 11 4 18 18    15 8 19    18 7 0 11 11    12 0 10 4    22 0 17    0 6 0 8 13 18 19    19 7 4 12,    0 13 3    18 7 0 11 11    14 21 4 17 2 14 12 4    19 7 4 12,    0 13 3    10 8 11 11    19 7 4 12.    0 13 3    19 7 4 8 17    3 4 0 3    1 14 3 8 4 18    18 7 0 11 11    11 8 4    8 13    19 7 4    18 19 17 4 4 19    14 5    19 7 4    6 17 4 0 19    2 8 19 24,    22 7 8 2 7    18 15 8 17 8 19 20 0 11 11 24    8 18    2 0 11 11 4 3    18 14 3 14 12    0 13 3    4 6 24 15 19,    22 7 4 17 4    0 11 18 14    14 20 17    11 14 17 3    22 0 18    2 17 20 2 8 5 8 4 3.    0 13 3    19 7 4 24    14 5    19 7 4    15 4 14 15 11 4    0 13 3    10 8 13 3 17 4 3 18    0 13 3    19 14 13 6 20 4 18    0 13 3    13 0 19 8 14 13 18    18 7 0 11 11    18 4 4    19 7 4 8 17    3 4 0 3    1 14 3 8 4 18    19 7 17 4 4    3 0 24 18    0 13 3    0 13    7 0 11 5,    0 13 3    18 7 0 11 11    13 14 19    18 20 5 5 4 17    19 7 4 8 17    3 4 0 3    1 14 3 8 4 18    19 14    1 4    15 20 19    8 13    6 17 0 21 4 18.]**

And that's the last saved update I could find on my laptop. I don't even remember writing that last entry at all or even if I ever really got to the top. I blacked out and suddenly woke up in my bed. I don't know what any of this means but if it coincides with what was deciphered from my first entry on reddit, then there isn't much time left. I don't know what to do or how I can stop any of this. This is above me. This is above all of us. I don't know if I have the will to try going back to **[5,433 Cubits and 2 Palms Tower]** but I need to make a decision soon because I can still hear the echo even now. It's **[coming for everyone]** and I can't stop it. 
























 Shame on you. Can you imagine how the Mother 4 team must feel right now? They're trying to do something great WITHOUT pay in the few hours of free time they have outside jobs and school and this is what they get in return. Insults and accusations? THEY OWE YOU NOTHING! Even if this game never came out (even though they've assured us otherwise) it's still the closest we have to more mother content and that should be enough. It's still a beacon for mother fans everywhere that this game series is still loved and that love is shared. It's a message for Nintendo that our admiration for the series lives on. Also, I really hope you all think about the kind of damage you might be doing to this project. The mother 4 team is full of real people who can also be discouraged like real people. Now more than ever they need our support. Nothing would make me want to drop a project faster than to receive this kind of feedback from all sides. Count yourselves lucky that they haven't pulled the plug. Also I hope the mother 4 team sees this and knows that there are still many people who do believe in them and don't care if it takes months or even a year. This is too important to give up on, I'm rooting for you. *attempts to pray* 




 oh, I was commenting on mother 4's development time. Although I'm wondering has it been longer? I know I hadn't heard about it until it was quite a ways in. 




 Most of the people in this subreddit have grown up with the Mother series. Many years ago, I stopped waiting for a new game to come out. I knew it was over and the dust had settled on my adventures in the Mother universe. Now everyone take a minute to realize you're getting excited for a new Mother game. This is real excitement for a real event that had a one in a million chance of happening! I bet you wouldn't have known you could feel this excitement for the Mother series ever again, just 5 years ago. It's just....it's just beautiful. :) 




 if you'll look at the top contributor of the creepypasta wiki you found it on, you'll see the name test_subject2452. That's me. I'm not entirely sure how else I can prove it, I can write a comment on that wiki using my other profile if you'd like. 




 Thanks everyone. The guys over at 4chan are such dicks, after posting there I thought my story must have been garbage, but this was a nice confidence boost. 
























 Alright, I'm back. There are even more comments now! I've been sitting here in shock since last night. I couldn't even sleep. I read over my precious comments again and again because I couldn't believe it! After all that's happened, how could I? I'm still not sure whether I should trust what I'm seeing, nothing makes sense...but thank you so much. I really needed these replies. I don't feel so alone now. Anyway, herzdonit, I was thinking I would try to at least explore the forest, maybe I could find a path through one of the lower mountains. Kaizack, funny you say that, first thing I did was try to get my IP through command line. I did a ping but the results were....I'll save that for the update. Right now I'm too shaken to talk about some of what I've uncovered. Please don't leave me. I don't know the right info to give you to help you find me, my mind is too fuzzy. Please don't leave. Please. 




 I haven't so far, but it's getting harder. I keep finding it in more and more places. Sometimes I wonder if it's spreading. I'm so glad I'm getting through. If this isn't real, I don't even care. It's so good to be talking again. 




 Oh god, is this real! Oh thank you thank you THANK YOU! Please don't go!  Please, I just really need someone to talk to. I need to know this isn't a trick. I'm so scared and you're finally here. Someone can hear me! I'm sorry, this might be too much for me right now. I'll be back after I'm done realizing this is real. So please stick around. 




 **[part 2](http://redd.it/3e0do2)**

 nbsp;

I'm hoping this works. God damnit, I'm fucking praying this works. It hasn't the last hundred times but maybe this will be the one that gets a response. I don't know how many more places I can post this. I feel like theres nowhere left to shout my message. 


According to this computer, nobody has responded on any other site I visit, not just to me but to anything. Nothing ever gets updated, I don't see new statuses on Facebook, and I'm starting to wonder if this computer is even connected to anything at all.

 nbsp;

If this does work, here's the first thing I need anyone who sees this to read: **FIND ME.** *Please.* 

 nbsp;

I cant really help you with this because there's nobody around to tell me where I am, but please try anyway. I haven't seen anyone since I got here and I haven't found any other ways to make contact. The phones are broken, the radios are weird...I happened upon this computer a few days ago and it seems like my only chance of getting out of this place. 


Sadly I can't give you so much as a hint as to the name of this place, I haven't found any signs that say anything about a location. I'd tell you my name if that could help but first I need a response. I need to make sure I can trust whoever's on the other end, I hope you can understand.


Maybe a backstory is enough for now? I'll start with the last thing I remember before waking up here:


I was excitedly preparing for a month long vacation from work to a pretty nice resort spot in Jamaica. I had a bunch of unused PTO, I was knee deep in code at work and I figured I needed a break. Hell, my coworkers were begging me to take time off. Apparently I looked exceptionally tired. As a web developer working for at least 30 different clients from a particularly small web firm, Id have to agree with them. The work was indeed exhausting. There's nothing too interesting about all this, but it's what led to the following events so I'm not sparing any details. I can't afford to, ya know?


I had just finished packing my car, my neighbors were ready to start collecting my mail, and I was about to head to the airport for my much needed R R when I remembered I wanted to take a decongestant so my ears wouldn't pop on the plane. I headed to the tidy kitchen in my lonely little house in the suburbs. Everything was spotless and as it should be which gave me comfort knowing it would be this way on my return. It was nice knowing I could just leave everything behind for awhile without worry. I needed a change of pace.

 nbsp;

At least thats how I felt *back then.*

 nbsp;

I grabbed a pill from my medicine cabinet. As a frequent allergy sufferer, I'd done this hundreds of times before so I wasn't paying attention as I popped the pill and chased it with a glass of water....god, why wasn't I paying attention?


I looked in the pill bottle as I was closing it and noticed the pills were the wrong color. What? They were supposed to be pink but these ones were white. They had never been white. Someone had been in my house and switched the pills...


Panic came over me instantly, I knew I had to act fast but I was stuck in that moment where you don't know what comes first. My heart was racing as I made up my mind. After a few moments of jumbled thought, I finally ran to the sink to make myself throw up.

 nbsp;

but then my heart stopped racing.
Then the panic went away.

 nbsp;

I couldn't even reach up to my mouth to stick a finger down my throat. I closed my eyes and my face began to feel like cotton. My knees buckled and I collapsed. Moments before I blacked out entirely I could feel something grabbing my legs and pulling me across the floor.


I awoke with a pounding in my head and the kind of dry throat where swallowing seemed to make it worse. The fear returned as if I had just been in my kitchen minutes ago, but the change in my surroundings told me it must have been much longer. I was in a broken spring bed with quilted blankets. There were dusty knick knacks and old furniture scattered about the bedroom and the walls were made of unfinished wood. It all reminded me of my grandparents cabin in the forest back home. 


I creaked my aching bones out of the bed that was holding me. It felt like I hadn't moved in days. I made my way to the bedroom door, hoping to find a sink somewhere in this old place. I was so thirsty.


Upon exiting, I had to catch myself by grabbing hold of the doorframe. This was the second floor of a cabin that had been torn in half. The staircase and walls in front of me were completely gone, leaving a giant opening to the world outside. Everything else was in shambles. It looked like a tornado must have hit here.


I gazed out at the horizon. I was at the top of a small hill, surrounded by thick forest. There were tall mountains on all sides of this tiny valley, trapping the forest like a prison cell. At the bottom of the hill, following a clean paved road was a town. Early on, I was reassured by the sight of civilization.


I jumped down from the crumbling hallway onto a couch covered in cabin debris. The small bit of good news I found here was a sink at the back of the kitchen directly behind the couch, now completely exposed by the lack of separating walls.


The rusty faucet knob creaked as I turned it. I expected crisp, cool mountain water but instead a thick black sludge came oozing out. useless.


Instead of wasting my strength here, it was time I headed to the town below in search of water and hopefully an idea of where I was. After escaping the wreckage, it was nice to find solid footing even if it was unfamiliar ground. The walk down the road was almost pleasant, if not a little eery. It was quiet. Absurdly quiet. The leaves didn't rustle, there wasnt an animal in sight to make chirps or squeaks. The clouds were dark and heavy, but there was no rain, no wind. There was no change, everything seemed stagnant.


There was a gas station at the top edge of town along my descent. A sign across the entrance said shop quickly which puzzled me, but I was far more distracted by what I realized next. There was nobody filling up the cars parked by the fuel stations. There was nobody inside buying sodas or cigarettes. I walked up to the window of the station and there wasnt even anyone manning the register.


The door was unlocked. Hellllooooo?! I shouted as I grabbed some snacks and drinks from the shelves. I was met with no response, so I left some money on the counter and made a swift exit. Oh right, I used money from my wallet. This lead me to realize my captor had left me with my wallet, id, credit cards, and everything else I had on my person. What was going on here? What did they want from me?


The bottled water was stale but it felt good on my throat. I kept walking into town as I munched on some nearly expired potato chips. The buildings around me were old and poorly kept, full of broken windows and dented street signs. Street lamps had toppled over and cars were crashed into each other everywhere. Perhaps it was from the storm that destroyed that cabin on the hill. Maybe it was something else. I wouldnt know until I found someone with answers.


Yet there was no one to find! Everywhere I looked was empty. I thought I saw a shadow of someone in a window once but when I looked back they were gone. Later I thought I saw someone again but it was just a mannequin in a shop display. Its head was missing and in its place was that same black sludge from the faucet earlier, dripping slowly down its neck. 


The more I looked, the more I noticed this sludge on random things across town. It was wiped on signs and billboards, fire hydrants, counter tops and registers in shops, and an old phone box on a street corner.


A phone box? That meant a payphone! Here was a chance to finally call someone! I wish I had remembered to put my cell phone in my pocket before the kidnapping but I was too panicked to remember. This was just as good though, or at least I thought at the time. I put a coin in the slot and waited for a tone.


Now remember how I said the phones were broken? Well broken isnt exactly the word. Something much stranger was happening. Its one of several reasons I want to leave this place immediately. There was a dial tone after the coin had fallen into place but I hadnt pressed any of the numbers. There was a sound of connecting to the other line and everything after that I could hardly explain, but Ill try. 


I was only listening with one ear but the sound was somehow binaural. It was all around me like surround sound, but the quality was still that of an old payphone which was a new and chilling sensation. I heard loud wind and thunder, windows crashing and muffled screaming as people ran by. I instinctively darted around trying to avoid the sounds like they were real. I was afraid something was going to break through the glass box I was in. There was the sound of a car running into the broken streetlamp in front of me and I heard the metal bending as if it was falling over for the first time.


Suddenly, just as it had started, everything stopped and I was left with the buzzing sound of silence. The air around me felt electrified and hot. After a moment of reprieve, I heard the thing behind me. 

 nbsp;

**That moaning.**

 nbsp;

Ill never forget the sound. I could almost feel its vibrations on the back of my neck.

 nbsp;

I slammed the receiver down and closed the payphone door behind me. I wasnt going to use another phone in this town as long as I was trapped here. I hurried down the street in front of me. then I passed down another. and another. 

 nbsp;

and another. 

 nbsp;

It was all the same! There was nothing! There was no one! All the exits from the town lead into dense forest followed by mountains that I couldnt possibly climb without gear. I was trapped here with nobody around to help me. I broke down and cried pathetically and without restraint. Why was this happening to me?! What had I done to deserve this? If they didnt want my money, what did they want from me?!


Then I heard it. Through my sobs was a voice talking in one of the buildings. FINALLY! Someone to talk to. There was someone here that could help me! I dashed inside the building where the sound was coming from. It looked to be an old radio station. There were big bold letters spelling out RMR behind the secretarys desk. The front door was removed from its hinges and missing, along with all the other doors inside. 


I could hear a man speaking casually to someone on one of the floors upstairs, I was so relieved. I ran up the stairs like a child on Christmas morning, careful to avoid the chunks of concrete that had fallen from the ceiling. It was once I reached the sixth floor that I knew I was close to the source. I walked past the open rooms until I saw where the sound was coming from.


In the third room on the left from the stairs was the station control room. There was an old record spinning on a vintage record player next to a dusty microphone above all the station controls. The record was making that snapping, crinkling sound that old records do. The man speaking on the record must have been a disc jockey from an old 50s radio show. I had caught him in the middle of a news bulletin as I walked into the room. 


Heres the word from the bird, looks like a storm tonight, and its gonna be a doozy. To all you paper shakers and big daddys playing back seat bingo out at the passion pit, dont be a wet rag and get yourselves home. Heres a little something to help you lay a patch. Play that number, Suzy! 


Just as he finished his sentence the record cut out to the most shrill high pitched sound Id ever heard. It was so loud it sounded like it was coming from inside my head. Then it switched over to radio static mixed with a gurgling sound like someone was shouting underwater. The sound hurt me to my core, I could feel it inside me, invading my brain. I grabbed the record player and threw it against the wall and watched it smash into dozens of pieces. What the fuck was happening here?! I felt like I was losing my mind! I flipped the radio controls hoping to reach someone.


Is anyone there? Can you read me? Hello hello! I must have flipped every switch in there but it was no use. There was no response. Nothing. **Then there was a knock.** It came from out in the hall. After the phone and the radio I became suspicious of pursuing any more sounds, but what choice did I have? If I waited here in this town long enough I would die. The food would expire, I would run out of clean water, and that would be it. I didnt have the luxury of just hiding away and I certainly wouldnt make it in the forest. I wish Id paid more attention in Boy Scouts.


**Another knock.** I was terrified, but I slowly inched my way out into the hall. I went past three more open rooms and found the source. this was the only room in the whole building that had a door. Next to it was a small desk with a drawer. The knocking continued.


is anyone there? **There was another knock.** Hold on, Im going to open the door. I jiggled the handle. No good, it was locked. I shifted to the table and opened the drawer. As I expected there was a key. Actually there were six keys. I wondered what the other five were for. I grabbed the first and slid the key into place. There was a click and the door unlocked.

 nbsp;

Okay, Im coming in. I said with a shaky voice. I opened the door and there was another knock. 

 nbsp;

In front of me was another door. 

 nbsp;

Now I understood what the other keys were for. Whatever was behind here needed to be kept hidden. It needed to be kept restrained. So much so that one door wouldnt be enough. I was trembling as I reached for another key. I knew it was stupid but I didnt know what else to do. Whatever brought me to this town couldnt be behind this door. You cant lock it from the inside. That means its still out here so Im in just as much danger. I unlocked another door.

 nbsp;

**Another knock.**

 nbsp;

The knocks were getting louder, whatever it was seemed to be growing impatient. I reached for another key and unlocked another door. Please, stop knocking. Im going to open the doors okay? Im coming in. but it continued.


I unlocked another door and the knocking stopped. Now it was slamming itself into the door with full force. Boom! I could almost hear the door cracking on the other side. I didnt know if I should continue at this point because the thing inside was getting aggressive. then again, maybe they needed help just like me. Maybe if we could work together we might be able to get out of here. I caved and let myself unlock another door. BANG! It slammed again.


Then there was just one key. One more door. The booming was so rapid and the door looked as if it was breathing each time the thing rammed into it. I was so scared but I wasnt going to give up. BOOM! Another crash into the door. Curiosity was taking over me and I had to know what was waiting on the other side. BANG! Another slam against the wood. I grabbed the key from the drawer and slowly clicked it into place.


The banging stopped. The knocking stopped. It was silent. I slowly turned the metal handle, with no idea what might be on the other side. Whatever it was, it needed six doors just to be contained. There isnt a thing alive that needs that much restraint. My brain was screaming at me to turn around and leave but Id already committed. I was about to see what was inside.

 nbsp;

I swung the door open.

 nbsp;

The room inside was caked in dust. there was black and white checkered tile flooring and no windows to be seen. Above were fluorescent lights that flickered, struggling to stay lit. It looked like nobody had stepped foot in here for years. I was tense and proceeded cautiously. There was nobody inside. There was nothing here. No tables or chairs, completely empty. I started to sigh in relief when I heard something. It was the whir of a computer turning on. In the center of this otherwise empty room was an old beige computer. It booted up with the classic windows 95 sound, although very offkey, like the internal sound card was broken far beyond repair.


I was still pretty terrified, but at least now I had a computer. Albeit an old one. I saw an internet cable running out of the back, the monitor was functional, things were looking up a little.


I sat down in front of it. I really wish there had been a desk but it was just sitting alone in the middle of this dusty floor. That might explain why the sound was off and the colors were wonky. The dust had probably been getting into all the circuits over the years, I was lucky it even booted up at all.


It loaded the windows 95 user interface with only one icon on the desktop. No My Computer, no recycle bin. Just Netscape Navigator directly in the center of the screen. I double clicked it. The dial up window appeared, but instead of boxes for my information or a place to put in the ip address, etc. it had a single button that said connect?


It was weird that the button had a question mark. It was almost like it was asking me a question instead of giving me an option. I clicked it and waited. Suddenly the old dial up tone started but it sounded completely wrong. Later I managed to search youtube from this computer so I could provide you with an example of what it sounded like because if you hear it youll understand why this doesnt just seem like a broken sound card. Youll know why Im so afraid and why I want to be found.

 nbsp;

Trust me though, what youre about to hear isnt nearly as terrifying as what I heard, its just the closest I could find:

 nbsp;

**[Dial Up sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LjQ6a773EM)**

 nbsp;

Its been a few days now since finding the computer. Nothing too strange has really happened since then. I keep finding more black sludge around town as Ive been exploring peoples homes for food and water. The sludge seems to appear most commonly on the front doors of homes, but also on many of the beds where I assume people slept. I moved a mattress that didnt have any sludge into this computer room so I could be nearby in case I get any replies. Im still not sure if Im connected but I seem to have access to everything on the internet so well wait and see.


So if anyone is out there and youre able to read this, please let me know. Im screaming across the web for help because Im very scared and very lonely! The clouds outside are getting darker every day and I still dont know where the person who took me here is, or what was knocking on those doors. If anything new happens or if I come across anything on this computer, Ill be sure to post an update. Bye for now

EDIT: Something definitely happened. Here's  [part 2](http://redd.it/3e0do2) 




 No. What? No! They do get a free pass. Not one of us is actually giving them a fair reason to put forth effort into this. I'm more than grateful that they even sent out an update in June to say they can't meet the deadline because that's more than you can expect from most fan projects. I've seen so many projects die and usually you don't see any posts at all for years at a time. This is like royal treatment comparatively. Without compensation of some kind, anything they do is already more than we deserve.

EDIT: this was a reply to someone saying that these developers don't deserve a free pass just because they're doing it for free. I believe that comment was deleted but I still want to make this point.
