 In all honesty, being in love. I know it sounds cheesy and rather ridiculous, but its true. As a kid, I never grew up around lasting relationships and didnt experience dating until after my first year of college. So, for the most part, I had a bad start. Luckily that changed nearly 2 years ago. I still cant believe what Ive gained and cant imagine anything greater!  




 I can just imagine it thinking: 'Don't hate me for being short and fluffy!'

 




 Not to mention immature and illiterate. ^ Future teen mom.  




 We should start a wager on how long it remains open or at least brings in a lot of business. I recall when one opened in Wichita - a month or two later, no one cared. 

No hating against Krispy Kreme (and their fried dough of deliciousness), but do realize it's part of the fastfood fad.   




 See now, this makes us all look bad. Though I typically never admit to living/being from 'that state'.

Also, it snowed in southern Kansas and around the Wichita metropolitan area. I only know that b/c people won't shut up about it on Facebook. Ermahgerd it's snowing - in February - in Kansas!  




 I know you're heard this time and again, but you're only 21. I didn't have my first boyfriend until I was 25. Take time and don't rush into anything.  




 Even if I were to find new coverage, my current diagnosis still wouldn't be covered:

http://www.khiastatepool.com/KHIA-FED/eligibility_requirements.htm

How does that work? Plus why a -6 month- time-frame? I've never understood this.... 




  Are you trolling or are you really completely unaware of Obama attempting to fix everything you just said?

No, but you clearly are.  




 EXACTLY! Anyone can apply for insurance or get insurance, but those with pre-existing conditions are forced to suffer - and - be denied coverage that could help save their life.  




 Too bad I live in a state that doesn't offer government funded programs. 

Coverage in KS: http://www.statecoverage.org/coverage/kansas

Coverage in CA: http://www.statecoverage.org/coverage/california (CA since it offers MSI)

There's a clear difference on how you're covered, based on the state, and premiums received. 

I recall coming across something last month that showed which states receive government funds and which did not - I know KS was on the non-funded list. (Or I have this backward - I'm searching for the site to validate this comment.) 




 That's my current situation, plus thousands of dollars worth of medical bills that weren't covered.  




 I keep hearing too many sides to the story and I can't figure out which is true.

By living in KANSAS, of all states, receiving input on the benefits of ObamaCare are slim to none. I've tried to make sense of it all, but until something is put in place, we really have no idea what to expect.

I should also add that I'm 99.99999999999% against most politicians (and take neither side). What comes out of their mouth and what's written on paper (and mandated in to law), are two different things. I'm afraid whatever Congress has hidden up their sleeve might actually have a detrimental affect on society.

That's also a year away and I'm thousands of dollars in debt for something I can't afford to fix - yet it has a huge impact on my ability to function 'normally', and to hold a job.  




 I understand this post may come as a duh for some redditors out there, but I have something Ive wanted to get off my chest for the past few days.

A couple weeks ago I was diagnosed with a medical condition. Low and behold, it was the underlying cause for every medical problem I have had since I was in high school (12 years). Theses consisted of blackout headaches, sudden vertigo (that would last for weeks), uncontrollable irritability, and the list goes on. 

Now I am left to wonder, how can insurance companies deny me for pre-existing conditions when none were, in fact, the correct diagnosis. I applied for insurance within the past year, after losing what was  provided by the university (as a student), and found myself in quite a struggle because they continuously denied me coverage. Oddly enough, one was a company I had previously received coverage under before turning 18 (parents insurance). 

Now I am left, unable to find reliable insurance because I was misdiagnosed for most of my life. 

Am I the only one out there who feels this is in need of change? If you're denied insurance for reasons that weren't in fact true, how is that working in favor for both the companies and those needing coverage?
 




 Oh it was! I just find it astonishing, given all the research provided, that people still do this. Then again, I have smoked, drank, etc. Now that I'm a few years older, I no longer do either (for the most part) b/c I realized how detrimental it was on my overall health (and well-being). 

Sadly we live in a society (UK, US, etc) that promotes activities that aren't necessarily good for your health. Do realize though, back in the 1940s, smoking was considered cool and was featured 'as the thing to do' in most movies and other cinema. 70+ years later and we (given the scientific proof) know that people weren't as informed as they should have been. Perhaps this is a sign that we need to further inform younger generations of the true hazards this may cause to their health.  




 It's still a classic! If you ask any child of the 80s whether or not they liked 'Men in Tights' (and of course 'Space Balls) - expect a clear YES! We might have a bad taste in films (to some extent) but they're often better than most Hollywood flicks, today.  




 There's a reason we've been told (for how many years now?) to avoid high levels of UV light (aka tanning beds). Of course UV light becomes a problem, when out in the sun, but you stand a greater chance the closer you venture towards the equator OR if you spend a day at the lake and forget to reapply sunscreen. 

Ended up turning bright red (in Playa del Carmen) b/c I was too focused on having fun with the open bar, beach side view and relaxing pool. Didn't realize I was burnt until someone (coincidentally from the same part/state of the US) pointed it out. That trip dramatically turned south. I'm forbidden from using tanning beds by my doctors (increased chance of skin cancer), so when something like that happens, I do my best to never do it again. 

Honestly do not understand peoples fascination with tanning beds. I know someone who's 3 years younger but looks over 10 years older because her skin is permantely damaged and looks leathery - how is that appealing? I understand the warmth is nice, but is it worth it in the long run? 




 I honestly don't care anymore. Just found it odd you used brown when you have blonde hair. That would be the same as if I drew on blonde brows, even though I have dark brown hair. 

Things people post on reddit typically make no sense and I try to sort through and make sense of everything. 

I tried making a point, but all the posts managed to do was take down my karma - clearly not worth it anymore.  




 I meant to post this, but since I was posting via my phone, I couldn't find the link. Here's the link to NIH:

http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000371.htm 




 It depends on the individual. I hate relying on sites like this, but it provides a lot of info on different types of thyroid disorders. If you think you might have one, be sure to contact an endocrinologist:

http://www.m.webmd.com/women/guide/understanding-thyroid-problems-basics 




 Do you experience any other problems with dryness - dry skin (aside from hands), dry hair, etc?

I have the same problem and found out it was caused by a thyroid disorder.  




 I grew up in the 'middle-of-fing-nowhere KS' so I did the same. After a microburst blew through here a few years back, the thought of doing so (again) scares the cr@p out of me! 

I know the sound of silence, that accompanies these sort of storms and yeah, I'll pass on purposely seeing one/ hearing one again. (No hating against storm-spotters, amazed at what they do) 




 Events like this make me lose complete hope in humanity. 


If you live in the NE and still can't figure out snow - there's clearly something wrong. 


It would be equivalent to people in the Midwest, standing outside and watching a tornado. 
 




 I called her office several times over the past few weeks to get my appointment - scheduled for April 1st - move to this coming Friday. She will not provide any information until I get more tests run. Clearly that doesn't help me b/c I'm struggling now....

Hints, again, why I asked people here.  




 Thanks for the obvious, but since I can't see my doctor for nearly a week - decided to ask reddit. 

 




 I use to do yoga until the vertigo started. Never thought about just doing a weight version. Thanks for the tip!  




 I'll look in to the B12. My Endocrinologist insists I do not start any supplements until my next appointment, but I'll see what I can do.  




 I've had an endless battle with vertigo since 2008 - that ended may daily runs and exercise schedule. Any sudden movement will result with abrupt dizziness

I only drink purified water - looking in to getting a better system since the water here isn't too great. Also, I do not drink alcohol and maintain a vegetarian diet.  




 Clearly, being literate isn't a prime focus in these areas.....


 




 I maxed out on laziness with this one. Great to see someone made it even better!!! Thanks for sharing!  




 Pardon my typo: 'Drizzled' Honey

 




 Oh it is! There's no denying that! :-) 




 Lol thanks. More like ma'am and it was a collaborated effort with the bf! :-) 




 This post reminded me that I wrote a paper (in 2010) about 1940s propaganda cartoons, focusing prominently on Theodor Geisel, aka Dr. Seuss. Cant believe I forgot about that. Thanks for the reminder! :-) 




 Just imagine how it would look if you switched the creams :-X. Then again, I'd probably still eat it or at least try to (without laughing). 


There comes a time when being immature is socially acceptable - this would be it.  




 There comes a time when hoarding isn't such a bad thing. This would be a clear example. 

Whenever I travel, I always buy a shot glass or two. Unfortunately I dropped a box after my last move and lost a few. Sad times, but they can easily be replaced. 
 




 I buy locally grown, organic produce. My boyfriend is in the process of looking in to what would be required in becoming self-sufficient, but we'll probably need to hold out on doing so until we move to a bigger place. So are we doing everything we can to lower the chances of receiving bad foods - perhaps not, but we're doing what we can to get by.

Plus we never eat out, so that makes a tremendous difference. 




 People assume we eat salads. The closest I've come to a salad is a thai spring roll. Maintaining a vegetarian (not vegan) lifestyle really isn't that bad, plus it does wonders on your health. Several cultures even rely on vegetarian based diets, so they must be doing something right.

Oh and I still eat dairy and eggs, plus the occassional bacon. 

 




  people have got to work this out for themselves

They live a way of life where incidents like this are 'culturally acceptable'. By knowing that, there's little we can do and if people within the area try to speak up - we know very well what would happen to them. We've seen it on the news recently. 

Citizens are denied to right to speak up against such things and sadly, we can only wish for it to stop.  




 I agree with that too, but we can't always go in and just stop what they're doing. Same would go for what we do here (US) or wherever you happen to live. 

World peace and cultural understanding for all would be a triumphant achievement for man-kind, but it doesn't seem likely to occur anytime soon.  




 I see a dog shaped dust rag, that happens to be lovable, and can still get the work done!

Have to admit, it still looks adorable!  




 The US should look in to implementing such a program. Before graduating high school (2005), I was never offered a course concerning finances. Even after taking college accounting and finance courses, I'm still lost on what it entails. 

But then again, that's why we pay so much this time of year to have someone else do our taxes. Right? 




 Being a vegetarian doesn't seem too bad of a choice when you see this in the news. Not to mention, you never buy prepackaged (especially frozen) food.  




 Sam Brownback and every politician from Missouri would be proud! 



This is truly unfortunate, but it is another culture, and there's very little we can do.
 




 Too many comments to scroll through, but if my math stands correct (please tell me if it doesn't and be sure to explain why) this won't be possible for quite some time - and exists quite a distance from Earth. 

1 light year = 5,878,499,810,000 miles 

13 light years x 5,878,499,810,000 miles = 76,420,497,530,000 miles

It will be several thousand years before humans are even capable of reaching such depths of space.
 









 lol I've tried to do just that, but once I've read the book, I always look for dissimilarities. After taking a class focused on acknowledging this in sports literature, it's hard to stop.  




 Just found it ironic they changed it that much. I loved the book but lost interest in the film for reasons such as that. 

In the tunnel scene:

Book: 'Landslide" by Fleetwood Mac

Film: "Heroes" by David Bowie 

By omitting 'Landslide' and instead using 'Heroes' the meaning to the scene changed completely - at least in an emotional sense.  









 Taste and texture need to match. This is just too weird for me.  




 May I ask what that is? 




 I know this through experience. I suffered a TBI after being hit by a car around the age of 3 (1989). For rehabilitation purposes, my mom was told to buy me a cat. By maintaining a form of companionship with every cat I've had since then, I view it as a learning experience. Especially in learning how to care for another living creature. I understand caring for a cat and caring for a human are completely different things, but it still requires an understanding that's essential for children and adults, alike. 

Also, after the accident I stopped playing with toys. That was due in part to the injury and a 'shift' in my cognitive and neuropsychological abilities - but further emphasizes the companionship maintained with the fury feline friends.  




 HA! I thought the same! (But a little on the heavy side) 




 Thanks for the video! I'll be sure to check it out. I recall the guy appearing on Tosh.O or one of those shows..... 




 Serious mother issues. 

**Clear sign for future generations:** *to avoid incidents such as this, truly know and understand your child. It could have a tremendous impact on what they do/become later in life. Even to this extent.* 




 People have strange obsessions that never make sense. This is a clear sign of that.

Then again, there could be a psychological reason as to why he has a fascination with Miley Cyrus. Also, at what age (for both) did he gain this fascination? Just thinking that increased just how creepy this is.....

 




 I reformatted the post to make it easier to read and to highlight key points. If anyone has a question/comment, please do not hesitate to post. It would provide insight as to whether 1) people noticed this too, 2) if the reddit community finds this interesting, and 3) if it is even relevant.

 My comment was more of a reply to the bolded text.  




 Well that trip just ended.  




 It's still interesting to know. Discovering something out of curiosity isn't a bad thing.  




 I appreciate your posting of this, but the 2nd to last paragraph clearly makes the article pointless to read. It states:

Despite the efforts of the humble earthworm, the vast majority of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere - which is responsible for 60% of the total warming from greenhouse gases - is caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.
----------------
But earthworms only account for about 16% of greenhouse gases. How's that a concern? Worms have existed for millennia, but we (humans) haven't.

I understand their intention, but it doesn't seem to account for much. Especially when compared to human interventions.  




 These are known problems when taking birth control and just about every other prescription drug. I stopped taking them due to their constant (and unpleasant) side-effects. Even with an IUD, I still experience problems.

The only downside is the fact some of us take the pill/ use an IUD because we have to for hormonal reasons, not because we're sexually active. In my case, Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. May not sound too bad, but I'm only in my mid-20s.  




 For being 'wrong' a lot of people sure did like the post. Maybe you should accept others opinions and not react by telling me my opinion is false or 'made up".

Given the fact I haven't used Reddit for too long, I clearly need to figure more things out. At least I'm willing to do that before accusing people of providing 'false opinions'.  




 I know. I posted about it last week (4 days ago) - but trolls took over the post so I stopped. I have a passion for music and couldn't let this one go.

'The Imposter'
http://www.reddit.com/r/Critics/comments/17lvgo/the_imposter_hailed_as_one_of_the_standout_films/ 




 And that sir/ma'am is why I am here, sharing the documentary with this forum. It's clearly a compelling documentary but I wanted to highlight what made it just that. Clearly few of you agree with me, which is fine, but as I've stated time and again - I found a different underlying meaning based on my own understandings and experiences.  




 Of course it is one of the best documentaries of 2012 but it (the documentary) is popular for what it's showing the world - biases towards music (due to racism, mental health, people being @ssholes, etc.) in the 1970s NOT racism today. He's famous today because individuals took the time to understand his story and share it with world. 

Without the collaboration of the two individuals, the likelihood of you knowing of Rodriguez would be slim to none. He would still remain a legend - unknown to us - but popular in South Africa. Hell, everyone thought he was dead for decades until someone took the time to check and with that curiosity, came this documentary. Now you are left with this post trying to emphasize certain key aspects of the documentary and how it has/could shape what we know today. 




 A lot of time was spent focusing on racial discrimination - not just the record label being a complete @ss. The fact you are continuously refuting my opinion holds no value to me whatsoever and I will remain with the same opinion - whether it's right or wrong. Isn't that the basis for such forums? To express your opinion on a given topic/subject no matter how others react?
 




 I prefer this version, too bad it's not a full-length film - Seven PsychoCATS Trailer HD:

http://youtu.be/gS0P3vU5D_A 




 D@mn you beat me to it! I thought the same thing! Quite a strange assignment..... 




 I just hope such a documentary could help reshape fame in our society. You might ask, why not do it yourself? It's easier said than done and I'm worried no one would even care. It could forever impact what we know and can learn through music but, as you stated, we're living in too dumb of a society to understand such things. 
 




 You are correct. It is something truly worth watching.  




 Your comment brought to light the idea that we (as a society) need to reshape what we view as good. In today's world, it doesn't matter whether or not you have talent. Your luck of rising to fame has to do with looks, sex appeal, etc. 

Rodriguez wrote about the life he lived, but in a manner not accepted by 70s US culture. Shows like American Idol fully emphasize sex appeal and the like, over actual talent. I feel Rodriguez tried to push the boundaries at an earlier stage but we were too ignorant, of a society, to accept this. 

I will agree too on the lack of of musical talent for Bob Dylan, but that only further emphasizes my point. Or at least I think it does. I could be wrong.  




 Then the music industry is to blame? What made Santana any better? They both 'rose to fame' during the same time, but only one received recognition. 

He did everything in his power to sell music, but only 6 ALBUMS were sold in the US. The music was out there, but no one knew of it. Highly doubt that's a coincidence. 

PLUS: People would scratch out his top hit - 'Sugar Man'. Why on earth would people do that unless they wanted to keep him from becoming famous? 




 In order to gain attention, you must first attract people. He wasn't put in the proper position to do that and since race became an issue, that only pushed him further back. If you check, Santana and Jose Feliciano, both gained fame around this same time (late-60s and early-70s) Also, neither one was a US born citizen. Both were from other countries that possibly helped promote their fame. Since Rodriguez did not have an acceptable contract nor willingness from others, he was left in the dumps. Rather sad his music held no purpose where it was produced - US - but a bootleg version - in South Africa - brought him the fame he never thought he'd reach. 

I disagree on quality. I find his songs to hold a lyrical value and his voice only adds to it. One more thing - Bob Dylan rose to fame during the same time - 1960s-1970s. Rodriguez had the unfortunate circumstance of sounding a lot like Dylan, through the sound of his music. Perhaps this held a negative impact on his career. 

I absolutely adore his ability to refrain from accepting the fame - be it for mental, drug or whatever issues - that really doesn't matter. He did not let the fame get to his head and take away what he wanted from life. I would like to see musicians of today refrain from the fame and fortunes of their career - but it's not likely. 


***I have a different way of understanding what happened. Perhaps my approach is different than yours, and others, but I like to gain a clearer understanding as to why he never became famous in the US. I take what I know and go from there. 




 Bob Dylan of Detroit, Michigan - Elvis Presley of South Africa. 

Depends on the location. Either way he never gained popularity in the US (until now) due to his race. Use of the name Rodriguez during the 1970s made listeners refrain from listening b/c they expected him to be 'non-white. Quite an unfortunate story. It's even more remarkable the type of life he maintained (and still maintains) no matter the fame or fortune. 

True understanding of life and the pursuit of happiness. 




 Didn't take it in to consideration when creating the account. Might redo and add hearts or smiley faces to indicate I'm not a guy. Not sure what else to do. I will admit it's quite an amusement since I'm a petite female being referred to as 'sir'.  




 More like ma'am, but you are welcome!  




 Thank your for taking that in to consideration. The problem with forums like this, is the fact you're stuck dealing with trolls.  




 Congrats on understanding the concept of an exaggeration (and/or a foolish statement)! You would be surprised how often it is used to gain appeal from others. Ironically, I had no intentions of this. More so, I stated my overall view of the film. Why, might you ask, did I state (in full-context): 'The story that unfolds is nothing you could have every imagined'?

I have always found the human mind/ human experience (non-religious) to be an amazing thing. When you look right down to it, we still do not understand the true impact of the human mind. Over the next few years I hope to gain a greater understanding of this (through neuropsychology) and I felt The Imposter was an appropriate start 

It really depends on what you are looking for in a film. As a documentary I understood there would be limitations as to what could be shared but, overall, they portrayed the situation rather well. At the start of the documentary, did you expect the story to turn out as it did? I highly doubt this. 

I know several of you hated the move (1/10, etc.) but something about the film clearly struck other viewers. Why else did it receive such renowned support at the Sundance Film Festive and several other awards and nominations?
 




 Welcome! :-) 




 Thank You for posting this!!! I have been debating this very thing for quite some time. Even though I do not have moral support from most I know, this is something I have always found fascinating and can't wait to explore! :-)

I have ideas concerning music that I can't wait to understand in greater detail. Going about this won't be easy, but I hope to do my best!

 The OP has a point.

 It has the consistency of egg salad and a nice flavor with the smoked tofu. It's a great dish if you can handle the fact it isn't a 'true' Pad Thai! :-) 




 We agree, but it still works. 









 Relying on Toyota for being a cheap car and adhering to the idea that 'chiristians' lead the majority, are not the same thing. 

The first actually brings the idea that other countries control more of what we do than our own industries, advancements, etc. I don't see how that has any relation to removing something from US currency that does not apply to every citizen.  




 The inclusions of such words would imply that those using the currency abide by the idea. Imagine if another deity were represented or something completely against Christian morals. I'm pretty sure hell would freeze over and people would b*tch and complain nonstop.
 




 The US 1st Amendment states that we are to exercise the FREEDOM OF AND FROM RELIGION. Including 'In God we Trust' goes against this, in every way.

 Then what's the solution?  




 I know it crossed my mind a time or two, but I rarely took it in to consideration. After meeting Dan Barker a few years back, I began to realize just how much of a problem this was. First off, we (the US) are not solely a 'Christian Nation' and symbolizing such a thing on US Currency only provides more problems. I'm not sure where to go from there because that should make it rather clear, but I would like to point out the fact that (former motto) 'E pluribus unum': One out of many - seemed just fine.

I do not care if you are for or against, I only want to know if the problem actually exists outside of the US. I posted the FFRF url and Wikipedia to show the foundation of the problem...

"In God we trust " was adopted as the official motto of the United States in **1956** as an alternative or replacement to the unofficial motto of E pluribus unum, adopted when the Great Seal of the United States was created and adopted in 1782.[1][2]
"In God we trust" has appeared **on most** (not all) U.S. coins since 1864[3] and on paper currency since 1957

 The vegetable pancakes and yogurt make a great (and healthy) snack!  




 Both recipes came from the cookbook *Fresh Foods Fast: Delicious Seasonal Vegetarian Meals in Under an Hour*

Information included within the pancake recipe states that it was originally an Asian dish, but no other information was provided.  




 Recipes:


**    **

*: 4 *

1 cups red or brown lentils, rinsed

1 cup canned chopped tomatoes with their juice

3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

8 garlic cloves, peeled

2 teaspoons coarse sea salt or kosher salt

4 slices peeled fresh ginger, each about the size of a quarter

1 sprig rosemary

1 bay leaf

1 (10 ounces) bag washed baby spinach

2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice

Freshly milled black pepper


1.	In a pressure cooker (*       20-25        *) over high heat, combine 5 cups of water with the lentils, tomatoes, oil, garlic, and salt. Wrap the ginger, rosemary, and bay leaf in a piece of cheesecloth, tie it closed with kitchen string, and add this bouquet garni to the pot. Lock the life in place and bring to full pressure. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes.

2.	Transfer the pressure cooker to the sink and run cold water over it to release the pressure. Remove the lid and discard the bouquet garni. 

3.	Return the pot to medium heat. Add the spinach and simmer until wilted. Stir in the lemon juice. Crush the garlic against the side of the pot with the back of a spoon and stir so that all the garlic completely melts into the soup. Add pepper and serve immediately.

 Recipes in order: Quick-Cooked Tomatillo Sauce (Salsa Verde), Thick Cream (Crema Espesa), and Layered Tortilla Casserole  (Budn de Tortillas) 

**Quick-Cooked Tomatillo Sauce** (Salsa Verde)

Ingredients: (Yield 2 to 3 cups)

-	1 lb (11 medium) fresh tomatillos, husked and washed OR two 13-ounce cans tomatillos, drained.

-	Fresh hot green chiles to taste (roughly 3 chiles seranos or 2 chiles jalapenos), stemmed

-	5 or 6 sprigs fresh coriander (cilantro), roughly chopped

-	1 small onion, chopped

-	1 large clove garlic, peeled and roughly chopped

-	1 tablespoon lard or vegetable oil

-	2 cups any poultry or meat broth (depending on how the sauce is to be used)

-	Salt, about  teaspoon (depending on the saltiness of the broth)

1.	*The tomatillos*. Boil the fresh tomatillos and chiles in salted water to cover until tender, 10 to 15 minutes; drain. Simply drain canned tomatillos.
2.	*The puree*. Place the tomatillos and chiles (raw ones if using canned tomatillos) in a blender or food processor, along with the coriander, onion and garlic; if using a blender, stir well. Process until smooth, but still retaining a *little* texture.
3.	*The Sauce*. Heat the lard or vegetable oil in a medium-large skillet set over medium-high. When hot enough to make a drop of the puree sizzle sharply, pour it in all at once and stir constantly for 4-5 minutes, until darker and thicker. Add the broth, let return to a boil, reduce the heat to medium and simmer until thick enough to coat a spoon, about 10 minutes. Season with salt.

**Thick Cream** (Crema Espesa) 

***Instead of this recipe, we just mixed heavy whipping cream and sour cream. But, this is the more traditional approach to preparing thick cream. If preparing this, start a full day ahead (or longer, if the incubating spot is cool). The cream will keep for 1 weeks or more, covered and refrigerated. 

Ingredients:

-	1 cup whipping cream

-	2 tablespoons buttermilk

1.	*Preparing the cream*. Pour the cream into a small sauce-pan, set over low heat and stir just until the chill is off, *do not* heat above 100 (lukewarm). Stir in the buttermilk and pour into a glass jar
2.	*Ripening the cream*. Set the lid on the jar (but dont tighten it) and place in a warm (80-90) spot. Let the cream culture and set for 12 to 24 hours, until noticeably thicker (perhaps almost set like yogurt or sour cream). Stir gently, screw on the lid and refrigerate at least 4 hours to chill and complete the thickening. 

**Layered Tortilla Casserole**  (Budn de Tortillas)

Ingredients:

-	Vegetable Oil

-	12 corn tortillas (we used soft corn tortillas)

-	2 cups Quick-Cooked Tomatillo Sauce (Salsa Verde)  *recipe above*

-	3 large chile poblanos (we used 5 Anaheim peppers) -- Roasted, peeled, seeded and sliced

-	1 cups Thick Cream, or thinned commercial sour cream  *recipe above*

-	1 cups (6 ounces) grated melting cheese like mild cheddar of Monterey Jack.

1.	Quick-fry 12 corn tortillas in vegetable oil, 2 or 3 seconds per side, then drain well.
2.	Line the bottom of a 9-inch-square baking dish with 3 tortillas (slightly overlapping).
3.	Top with  of the sauce, cream and cheese, and 1/3 of the chiles; repeat with three more layers (the top will have no chiles).
4.	Cover and bake at 350 for 30 minutes. Strew with onion rings, (and radish rounds), then serve.
5.	Optional: 1 cups shredded cooked chicken, pork or fish can be layered with the chiles. 
 









 How well does he get around? I've never met a cross-eyed cat, so I'm curious as to how well they get around. Also, congrats (and thank you) on taking this lil'guy in!  









 I did, but it freaked me out and I wasn't sure if it was a ring or the IUD had moved. Hints why it came as a surprise that the ring wasn't removed.  




 Sadly, no. 














 The recipe is included with the pictures.  




 Welcome! Might want to invest in the cookbook. It has a lot of great recipes!

 Right on, man!  




 Since it was a ring, it might not be treated the same and can be left in. I just did what I was told, but forgot to take it out.  




 What MILF represents in English and in the US has no assocation to its use in other languages and countries. I understand people found this to be amusing but we can't infer they had any idea what this was showing. 

 




 Damn, I saw this post when it was new and didn't think to post who it was. Just thought it to be common sense. Lame. Should have posted something.  




 Why do people insist on using the animals as a clear mode of entertainment? Recall the story a few months ago, of people stoning animals at a Chinese zoo? It's just as bad. Either way you're using the animal instead of seeing it in its 'natural' habitat.  




 Reminds me of the Admirals Club - but of course, mid-flight. That's a luxury I'd give into if I had to travel.  




 We're looking for sources of milk. It's not a common thing here.  




 We eat a lot of homemade pizza and decided to make mozzarella this time around. There was a clear difference in quality - especially texture - by choosing homemade over store bought. We were giving it a try since it costs about the same. I won't know until we do it again whether or not it's worth doing it from scratch. In hindsight, by preparing it, you know exactly what your eating - so that pays off.

 It's an authentic dish to a region of Mexico.  




 Same information is featured in the cookbook - *Authentic Mexican: Regional Cooking from the Heart of Mexico*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Recipe
(Arroz con Leche)*

This dessert is softer and more cinnamony than our baked rice pudding. The flavors are simple and close to home, but its easy to develop a thoroughgoing love for it, spoonful after spoonful. Mexican people everywhere serve it as regularly as they do flan; its creamy and, in its own way, light and soothing.

This is an especially pretty and tasty recipe, based on one from Zelayarans Las 500 mejores recetas de la cocina mexicana.

Yield : 8 to 10 servings

**Ingredients**

2 inches cinnamon stick
A 2-inch strip of lime zest (colored rind only),  inch wide
1 cup rice
1 quart milk
 cup sugar
 teaspoon salt
4 large egg yolks
 teaspoon vanilla extract
 cup raisins
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cut into bits
Ground cinnamon, for garnish

Directions:

1. **The rice:** Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a medium-size saucepan, add the cinnamon stick and lime zest, then cover and simmer over medium heat for 5 minutes. Pour in the rice, let the mixture return to a boil, stir once, then cover and cook over medium-low heat for 20 minutes, until all the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender.

2. **The pudding:** Stir in the milk, sugar and salt, and simmer over medium to medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the liquid shows the first signs of thickening, 20 to 25 minutes. Take from the heat and remove the cinnamon stick and zest. Beat the egg yolks until runny, stir in the vanilla and a few tablespoons of the hot rice, then stir the yolk concoction back into the rice mixture. Mix in half the raisins, then spoon the rice pudding into a decorative 8-inch-square baking dish.

3. **Browning and finishing the pudding:** Preheat the broiler and dot the rice pudding with butter. Set the dish under the heat long enough to brown the top, 3 or 4 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining raisins and the ground cinnamon, and serve warm or at room temperature.


*Techniques*

**Thickening the Rice:** In Step 2, the mixture should be simmered only until the milk takes on a slight creaminess (it will still look soupy). Overcooking will give you something dense and unapproachable. Should the latter be your fate, stir in a few tablespoons of milk just al youre about to serve, dot with butter and brown again.


*Timing and Advance Preparation*

The rice pudding can be ready in an hour, much of which wont involve your direct participation. It may be prepared through Step 2 a day or two ahead, then buttered and broiled shortly before serving.

*Regional Explorations*

Rice pudding brings to my mind the volatile, chancy crowd of Mexico Citys Garibaldi Square, where this dessert, only one of the attractions, sits in huge, milky masses stuck with a raisin or two for decoration. Or sometimes Im reminded of the well-used walkways around the Oaxacan market, where ladies sell it in paper cups at sundown. Or I picture any of a dozen other typical scenes: from rude, makeshift street stands to well-appointed traditional restaurantswhere arroz con lecbe is the thing you have.

 That has to be a pretty rare occurrence, right? Snow in Phoenix.  









 Still working out the kinks while using Imgur sharing features. The pic shown isn't the cover photo for the collection. 

Oh and this was taken in NE Kansas.  




 For those viewing, do you like the inclusion of information or was it too much? I wanted to make this a 'learning experience' of sorts and thought adding information about the dinosaurs and whatever else would be a great thing. 




 The ring was inserted instead of using oral birth control. No matter the type - even low dose - I would always feel sick throughout the day. As so, I used the sample packs to prepare my body for the IUD. I understand the purpose for most women is due to hormonal problems. This just happened to be the approach chosen by my doctor.  




 EXACTLY! Thanks for the reply! ^

Most (if not all) grocery stores (unless privately owned Co-Ops) receive all their produce from the same location. Hints why the UPC codes for produce do not change upon location! This makes express checkouts (self-checkouts) a great thing to use! (Also worked at Dillons in high school so I recall most of the codes....)

Meat providers possibly stay the same, that I do not know. In regards to dairy, well clearly Dillons/Kroger has a different private provider than WalMart - aside from the name-brands that appear in every store: i.e. Silk, Roberts, etc.  




 Care to share the recipe you used?

Sorry for the long reply! The recipe can be found here: http://imgur.com/a/6bnoI. Enjoy! :-) 




 That is the recipe, to some extent. In another reply, I included pages from the cookbook *Fresh Food Fast: Delicious, Seasonal Vegetarian Meals in Under an Hour*. This includes the 'menu page' showing what is needed and then each recipe follows (3 in total). Basically the recipe is more organized in the post I submitted. Sorry again for not responding to you in a timely manner.  




 Hold your horses! I've spent the past hour putting together a reply! (AND sorry for forgetting to recheck this last night!)

 I have hormonal problems and she wanted to wheen me on something before going straight to the IUD.  




 Damn stop with the harsh criticism. I asked nothing of this. Thanks for making me see posting on this subreddit is useless. Might actually stick to receiving advice over Facebook (sadly).  




 No worries, just wanted it to be known that I wasn't that clueless and ill-informed!  




 What's with all the criticism? 

Know what happened on the day I went in to get the IUD? I was sick. Felt like complete sh*t. So know what I did in spite of all of this? I forgot to remove the ring. Hints why I had informed her that I forgot to remove it. 

 




 Whoa there, being educated wasn't an issue. Before getting the IUD, I had read through a lot before deciding to get it. I know how the ring works, where it is placed, etc. It just surprises me that, even when feeling around, she still missed the ring - when I went in for the month check-up, last Friday! I recall stating to her that I had forgotten to take it out and she said she would before inserting the IUD. Clearly she forgot. 

In response to how long to use it, I was (at the time) wearing the 2nd of a sample pack - and yes it was in the span of 3-weeks. Of course now it has been over a month, with the same ring. Of which I did not know was there to begin with. 
 




 Oddly enough they did an ultrasound after inserting the IUD and still missed the NuvaRing. Also, I had the ring in a few weeks before getting the IUD, but I figured she removed it before inserting the IUD. Guess I was wrong. :-/ 









 Why'd you have to do this? You create a troll post about the BEST MUSEUM I HAVE EVER BEEN TO (sucks to live in KS...) and turn it in to this. 

I might post pictures from my trip to the museum. It was quite an adventure and worth sharing! (r/pics?) 




 I like how they automatically assume the child won't be raised properly. Isn't it up to the child on their culture, belief, etc? Say, for instance, a Turkish child was adopted by a non-Turkish family. If they were old enough to comprehend the true ideals of the culture, shouldn't the decision be left to them? 




 Meh 




 That's not until the second paragraph. How it starts out doesn't make you care much for his sake:

THE MODEL girlfriend of Olympic hero Oscar Pistorius spent her final minutes cowering behind a bathroom door after a late-night fight with her gun-loving boyfriend.

They sure do put a lot of emphasis on model. Maybe it's just me and the fact I hate models, Hollywood and the like or maybe I see that tabloids, stories, etc aren't written in an attempt for people to understand the true impact of the situation.  




 Tabloids are trash - that's a known fact. Perhaps this was just a bad article and that's unfortunate. 

I'm not saying it's objectifying in any manner, the fact they used that as a key word in the title makes you wonder if anyone cares about his mental state or more of the fact, who he killed. Why not just refer to her as  Reeva Steenkamp - in the same way why isn't 'athlete' in front of Oscar Pistorius? Model seems to be overused....like it's supposed to hold some significance.  




 I just fail to understand the fuss about it, as long as you're in the comforts of your own home. Since it asked about 'married couples', I wanted to point out the fact you don't have to be married to feel comfortable around each other. I do my best not to 'toot' around him, but it's a natural process the body experiences. And hey, we've grown to laugh at the cost of what others would find grotesque and unappealing - in order to not take everything so seriously and to just relax and understand it's a part of life. 

Taking a shit on your from lawn isn't the same. That clearly includes the public and violation of law.  




 Hell we do that and we're not yet married! Been together almost 2 years and we understand it's a normal bodily function. Not quite sure when we were officially "ok with it', but since we've lived together, it hasn't been a problem. Actually laugh at times b/c he'll choose to fart at the most awkwardly, hilarious times!  




 I'm an overly opinionated, well-educated, secular humanist. Not to mention, I'm a woman, in my mid-twenties and the height (and overall size) of a teenager (13/14 years of age - statistically speaking) No matter when I live, I'm not in the majority. BUT If I had to choose, it would be during the hippie generation (1960s) with a mix of the disco generation (1970s).  




 Steal all their toilet paper, wait about a week, go back, and TP their house with the evidence.


I wouldn't actually do that, but it sounds rather amusing... 




 My mom's bichon frise will react to names - depending upon who it is. If she says my name or one of my brother's she'll get really excited and dart through the house. If we're actually home at the time, she'll go find us. Whether or not it's considered smart, it sure in the hell is adorable! 

She didn't get the dog until we all moved out. At most we're only home a few times a year. The fact she still makes that association is quite remarkable.  




 Thanks! :-) 




 Can't believe I waited until last year to start watching 'Good Eats'. It's a great start for those learning to cook, by demonstrating just how easy of a process it really is! 

All thanks go out to Alton Brown ('Good Eats') and Julia Child ('The French Chef') :-) 




 Sauce was a last minute thing. First we tried melting the fresco queso  (with heavy cream) over a double-broiler, but the consistency was still lumpy, grainy, and the sauce had little taste. We decided to add hand-grated swiss cheese and some of the 4-cheese package varieties from Sargento. Even after using a submersion blender, we couldn't get past the graininess. By then we were too hungry to care (well past 8:30 pm central time). Also sprinkled in cumin, red pepper flakes and whatever else my boyfriend happened to slip it. It added a great flavor, but we will be sure to check out a good recipe next time (instead of just winging it). 




 That does not surprise me. I was (at times) absolutely furious b/c it was taking so long, but I wanted to prove to myself I could do it. My boyfriend typically makes dinner, so this was a chance to both thank him (valentine's day present) and to see if I could make the recipe w/o ending with (as he likes to say) 'f*ck it empanadas!'.

 Choose something you've always wanted to learn/do.

I'm on the same boat and decided to learn to knit, relearn to play the piano and read (about topics that interest me). All require the willingness to learn and excel - but will be well worth the effort in the future!  




 To get my health under control and to focus on researching music and cognitive psychology. Until the first one gets under wraps, I'm pretty much screwed.  




 Basic anatomy of the eye. We clearly evolved to a suitable point, but in retrospect, it's all backwards in how the eye operates.

I have horrible eye-sight and feel this would make a tremendous difference.

Then again, that would require mutations none of us could possibly live to see.  




 It took 25 years until I found out I was a bit of a b*tch. No one ever mentioned it. This finally came to light when my boyfriend brought it up. Don't take that as a bad thing, it has actually reshaped my life - in a remarkably good way.  




 Welcome to my hipster side....know what I do? I walk. I know that sounds lame, but if you live in a city that has a lot of hills and views, you're bound to discover things you never imagined. 

You would also be surprised of the artwork often spread throughout cities. While on one of my leisurely strolls last year, I made frequent stops along the way to find hidden graffiti, and other artwork, down the main street in town.

***This though, would require a lot of walking, and that might not be your thing. 

 




 A lot of college towns do not hire college students and, instead, only hire high school aged students within the city - my story for the past 5 years.  




 I could do without catching the cold, flu, or any virus/disease - period. Eradicating that problem would be superb.  
























 Thank you and I'm glad to see you have taken those extra steps, in life, to ensure your safety, as well as others!  




 I know all to well what you are talking about and find it quite unfortunate that Brownback (and the Koch brothers) have chosen this route. 

After serving an AmeriCorps term and working at Harvesters - Community Food Network, I have had first hand experience working with families in need. With all the govt. shutdown nonsense affecting recipients of WIC, this will only create more problems for these families and the life and well-being of (KS) citizens. 



 









 Neither do a lot of college students. Though that's due to ignorance, more so than zero awareness.  




 Surprised no one has mentioned contraceptives. Isn't that one of the basic reasons Republicans wouldn't accept the Affordable Care Act (or at least it was highly publicized as a reason)? Seems ridiculous but then again, they also think it's necessary to accept rape.

Ok so that went from funny to sad, I do apologize. But only to non-Republicans. Otherwise you guys suck, and by suck, I mean your own balls. 
 




 Wow, based on the original post, I wasn't expecting such harsh criticism. 

It is great to see a 'sneaky frat guy' actually showed respect for a drunken female. This DOES NOT mean all frat guys behave the same way. I've had my fair share of run ins with college douchebags, so I know.

As so, I have respect for this individual - - not all frat guys.

Oh and my brother is an alumni of a fraternity, so I have respect for those I know are actual gentleman.

Edit: Corrected a typo. 




 Finally have some sense of respect for frat guys. Let me emphasize some, not all. 


 




 Wow, that was one nostalgic moment! I'd sit in my Dad's office for hours playing this - PC version.  




 Abe   Jake's closed, Quintons must have gotten old and Fatsos might have the same turnout. That leaves all the hipster bars on Mass. Sadly, they chose Jazzhaus as their new mating grounds.  




 All the cool bartenders left, karaoke night turned into a group of frat boys screaming to a song on stage (not just during the summer), plus the quality of drinks changed, too. If you can't make a proper martini, don't work at the Jazzhaus. 

Ahhh back in the day. Oh wait, that was only a few years ago. 

 




 Jazzhaus use to be cool, now it's 'bro central'.  




 My first camping trip was at Woodridge! Can't wait go camping again and this time around, we'll be sure to collect more wood for the fire!!
 




 Ok so, maybe nerve-wracking wasn't the best word choice, but it is quite annoying!  




 We're backwards in these here states.


Will admit though, it's quite nerve-wracking when reading a date and not realizing the switch. 




 Didn't know any famous people, directly, but went to school for a few years with Kristie Alleys' niece and Kevin Bacons' brother/cousin was a teacher and coach at my high school. I'm not sure of the exact relationship, but he looked a lot like Kevin - almost identical.  




 Am I the only one who can't access the entire story? So far I can only read through Part 2: The Dangers. 

Otherwise the browser won't respond. Not sure if it was a problem with my laptop or Reuters' site. 

 




 With most inserted objects (graphs, pics, etc), you must select the object and change its layout on the page.

 Your cat is doing that out of pure enjoyment/pleasure. It's not the same for the other kitty;  poor thing is scared!  




 The finished dish smells a lot like a pizza and tastes like a lasagna; with a quiche texture and a crust.

 














 That's why they built White House | Black Market. If shoes aren't enough, over-priced clothes will do.  




 Bros don't mate naturally, they use roofies.  




 That's what makes this such a great recipe! It doesn't relate - 100% - b/c the rice isn't prepared separately. But a pan isn't wasted b/c the rice is prepared along with the stock (vegetable or chicken), spices, onions, and tomatoes.

 Awww come on now, don't be hating. It's from the cookbook '**The Food of Spain**' by Claudia Roden. 
 




 Here are two sites you might want to check out:

1.  Migraine Associated Vertigo (MAV) 
(http://vestibular.org/migraine-associated-vertigo-mav).

2. Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) (http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/specialty_areas/vestibular/conditions/benign_paroxysmal_positional_vertigo.html)


From March 2008-July 2013 I was misdiagnosed as having Menieres. After receiving little assistance from my ENT, I decided to try and manage my dizziness on my own. This was quite a challenge given the fact I still didnt understand why I was dizzy.

Within the past year I decided I wanted to get rid of, or at least try to treat, this problem. After doing a lot of research for specialists in my area, I came across an Audiologist not far from here. After the first round of testing, my previous diagnosis turned out to be wrong. Through these tests alone, it was determined that I had Migraine Associated Vertigo (MAV). Coincidentally I suffered from chronic migraines (diagnosed as depression) throughout high school (Sophomore - Senior year) and had a few years of 'relaxation' (3 years) until the vertigo spells started. The culprit? ***STRESS*** 

After coming to this conclusion, I still had to take into consideration that once I started having dizzy spells, I too lost the ability (equilibrium wise) to play sports, run, dance, etc. My life went from being a fun, energetic college student, to a recluse. I could no longer stand this and spoke to my Audiologist about this very problem. He introduced me to the Vestibular Therapist in the office and after only a months work, Im no longer dizzy and my ears stopped ringing (experienced Tinnitus 24 a day/ 7 days a week for the past 5+ years). If my ears start to ring, its usually a sign that my bodys telling me to stop, and relax.  




 If you happen to have another cat, this breed tends to be territorial. Found this out after watching a few episodes of 'My Cat from Hell', and my mom just assumed it couldn't be fixed. Unforunately, it would have been an easy thing to do- had I only known at the time. She made me get rid of Bella after having her for only 2 years.

But..on to the good stuff:

Such a great breed, especially if you're in the mood for a playful, energetic and lovable kitty! Congrats!! :-D


 




 Looking at the cats eyes and how she digs her claws into the carpet, it's a clear sign she's terrified and trying to protect her kitten and not acting cute. 

Is it worth an 'aww'? Perhaps...but I still feel sorry for the cat.  




 Say hello to the 'Persian Death Stare'.  




 Thai Siam is great - instead of getting the usual Zen Zero or Encore. 

Merc deli is great (and Ingredient, too), but a bit on the pricey side. Same with Wheatfields, but their sandwiches are to die for! 

If she's in the mood for Falafel (restaurant opened by an owner of the Hookah House) be sure to check out Lebanese Flower on Mass St. They also serve hummus and other great food!  




 Watch episodes of The French Chef...she teaches you how to properly chop, cut, dice, etc.


Oh and the key to not crying - - make sure your knife is sharp!  




 If I recall correctly, she's a Blue Tabby Persian - but without all the hair!  









 No prob! :-) 




 It's a normal thing for Persian cats. They always get gooey stuff in their eyes! Perks for having a flat face....

 Oh yeah, should have mentioned that:

Soak the amount for 30min in cold water and be sure to rinse through. 

We used dried Shiitake mushroom that were already chopped up, but still had to remove a few stems from the reconstitutes mushrooms.

The dish is topped with flat-leaf parsley and parmesan cheese.  




 I'll post the recipe tomorrow! :-) 









 Knowing the characteristics of breeds helps keep incidents like this from happening. He's clearly a breed that loves affection and requires maintenance - grooming.

I have a pure-bred Persian. She's adorable as hell, but lacking in personality and requires daily grooming. It's what you typically expect from the breed. 




 There are several stores about an hour from where I live. I've thought about stopping by, but I figured it would work best to receive tips via Reddit, before going. Would definitely give me a clearer idea of where to start  shades, products, etc. 

Not to mention, I could call ahead to see if they even carry the product. Last thing I would want to do is drive there and not be find what I need! 



















 I've thought about permanent brows, but I'll need to do more research before commiting to something like that. As for the scar, most people don't...it's more of the reason why I wore makeup in the first place, so it continues to a main focus. Thanks for your tips!  




 Ahh yes, fine words  once shared by Jenna Marbles! I'm trying not to be such a perfectionist when drawing them out - just need to follow such words of advice! :-) 




 Thank you for your tips! I'll be sure to check out MAC products! :-)
 




 Wow, thanks! Those actually look a lot like my 'natural' brow. But not as thick! I'll be sure to check out the tutorials and products. Thanks!  




 Thank you so much for your post. And yes, it made me smile! I like knowing when someone else has a clearer idea of where I'm coming from!  




 I tried using Anastasia but always had problems getting my brows to match. Since everyone keeps suggesting the product, I might go ahead and try it again. 

Thank you! :-) 




 I've allllllways worn lipglosses and the like, but I wanted to look more 'grown up'. I'm the size of a kid (i.e. under 5ft) and looking older, helps out a lot!  




 This is when scaring becomes an issue. I've spoke and met with the surgeon I've used since I was a child, and scaring (on the left side) makes doing that, difficult. Not to mention I'm 'supposed' to get brow lifts to compensate for the lack of (normal) tissue on the left side of my face. Lol wow I know that probably came as a surprise! My situation is just too darn complicated! :-P BUT I still thank you for your advice!  




 Wow, I can't believe the number of replies! I really appreciate everyone's comments and will do what I can to reply over the next fee days! Thank you so much! :-) 




 I use a neutral concealer and a natural lite liquid fondation, but I'll be sure to try brighter lipsticks/lip glosses! Thank you! :-) 




 lol sorry. That wouldn't be the first time I got it wrong. Thanks for clearly that one up!  




 Oh eyebrows...once upon a time I had great eyebrows. Nice thickness and shape, but I was in high school and getting your eyebrows waxed was cool. So I went in and she took off too much - and well---- they never grew back (on both sides). On the left side (in the before picture) all visible brow was medically inserted years ago, to ensure I still somewhat had an eyebrow. It worked, for the most part, but transplanting hair (from say your head) to your face, it doesn't grow like facial hair....at all. Drawing them on hasn't been a great experience b/c I use to draw on a brown line and thought that would suffice. No wonder I received a lot of stares. Now I have a better idea of how they should look, just do not know how to go about drawing them! 




 OMG thank you for mentioning the winged eyeliner! I never could figure out how people did that! 

I'll be sure to look more into that, as well as the lipsticks! :-) 




 I've thought about using vibrant colors - such as purple - but always dreaded the idea of buying makeup that wouldn't be used! Thanks for the tip! :-) 




 I tried stenciles, but couldnt get the brows to match - height, shape, etc. Due in part to the scaring. I just trace the area out with an eyebrow pencil and fill it in with brown eyeshadows. Just using what I've had to get by!  




 Due to my skin tone, I can't find a color that really fits. Anything too dark or too light makes it the only thing you see, or directs attention to my eyes. It's quite a challenge...


I know, I know..then try something in-between. I have, and it's still overpowering :-/ 




 I've watched Youtube videos, and the like, for eyebrow tutorials, but it's easier said than done. Scaring makes drawing them on quite a challenge! I'll have a correct arch and shape (for my right eyebrow) but can't figure out how to replicate that for the left side. Have any tips?


Scaring certainly makes me self-conscious and I have even looked in to Dermabrasion, but it won't work the same for me as for others. Due to thinner skin (i.e. skin graft) plus missing bone tissue, muscle, etc, hiding such scars is quite a challenge.

Thank you for your kind words of advice! :-)
 




 When dealing with blush, I either can't see it or it's too overpowering. Can't seem to find a brand that compliments my skin tone. 

Eyeshadow is quite a bit different. As you can see, I have scaring above my left eye. More so, my entire eyelid consists of a skin graft. This makes applying eye makeup to be quite a challenge. Especially when I want to do something colorful and creative. Sorry, I should have made that problem more clear from the start. 




 Cellphone pics are quite a challenge when smiling! Spent close to 20min trying to take the before and after pics. Since there's a lot of scaring, by not smiling, you're able to see what I'm working with a little better. 

Lip color - ugh, that's a whole new challenge. I like light colors (i.e light pink, light bronze, just a shimmer, etc.) By not working much with lipsticks, etc. I haven't found a color that matches well. Or I find that it's too overpowering. 


Thanks for your tip! :-) 




 I've tried darks and lights (hair color) but never seem to know what to do with my overall makeup. Even tried dirty-blonde-streaks back in high school, and to be honest, it looked ridiculous. I also knew very little about makeup, so that's possibly a reason. 

lol I even owned a bronzer brush and whatever else, but never figured out how to use it (no one would ever show me!!!!). I also use primer - thanks in part to my boyfriend's advice, and it does help quite a bit! 

Thanks for your tips! :-) 




 Thank you for letting me know! Since there isn't a 'makeup advice' subreddit, I wasn't sure where to post!


Here's the link to the new post:

 My story:


I was hit by a car when I was a child (3 years of age - 1989 to give you a better idea of the time). Following the accident, I was both mentally and physically impaired. Both of which were apparent to the average person. As so I sought help via plastic surgery (and education...but that's another story). That is a lot to go through as a child and I am doing whatever possible to not seek help from that 'source of perfection'.


That is why I am here.


As you can see, I am rather pale, must draw on eyebrows, and the like, on a daily basis. No matter what I do, I cannot retain much color to my face. Over the past few months, I have experimented with different eye shadows and blush, but nothing seems to work. Also considered changing my hair color, but brown eyes make pairing quite a challenge. (i.e. I LOVE the woman's hair in the Wendy's commercials, but she also has blue eyes, so I'm not so sure if it would work.)


If you have any advice, please feel free to share!

 Thank you so much for sharing! I will definitely try it sometime soon!
Do you happen to know of a good recipe? If not, that's fine. Just thought I'd ask before searching! :-) 




 Thanks for providing me another reason to fear wasps - wasp invasion!!!! 




 We stored some in the fridge and fry up 2/3 cup, or so, when we want another. Quick, easy, and delicious!  




 Haha I wondered if someone was going to ask that. It's quite savory, but you're more than welcome to add something sweet. Actually think my boyfriend did that for lunch! 


Edit: yeah I'm not too sure about adding maple syrup. It's too savory of a pancake. It's served with a Tahini Sauce but you have to like sesame seeds.  




 Tip:

Oh and only make what you plan to eat. Not as great when reheated.


Also, if you are wondering about the taste. I'm horrible at describing these things, but the main flavors are curry and garlic. If you're familiar with Middle Eastern food, you'll have a clearer idea of this. I had someone ask and figured other people might wonder the same.

 Lol it's ok. I just find it odd a lot of people consider vegetarians/vegans to be weird/ not normal. It isn't mainstream in the US, as compared to other regions of the world, but it still is quite popular. Plus, this helps show that we eat more than just salads! :-)

 I thought about using a zip tie but couldn't figure out how to attach it  




 There's a bundle inside the shelf that attaches to one end on the wall and the bundle shown does the same for the right side. I was unable to attach both ends from inside the shelf. It allows for great support! I'll be sure to look in to changing the tape. We use it often, so we'll notice if it starts to give! Thanks for the tip!

 Re-organize everything in the office. Go through all the cabinets, rearrange as desired.

 I thought so too. We had half a cup of heavy cream left, so I decided to use that and half a cup of milk. Maybe the combination wasn't the best choice. Plus, I had under 2 lbs of russet, so I used new potatoes to even out to around 2.5 lbs.

 Recipe: http://www.surrealconfections.com/2013/03/irish-crepe-cake.html?m=1

Tips:

- Each crepe takes between 15-20min to prepare. ~10 minutes for the first side and, give or take a few, about 5-10 once you flipped to the other side.

- If you have more than one saute pan, you'll be a lot happier. I wish I had at least 4. Otherwise I spent between 3-4 hours just to make the crepes.

- Try not to eat all the whipped cream before spreading it onto the crepes!!! :-)

Sorry for the bad pictures. I was really excited to make this for St. Patty's  and wanted to share; even though it looks sloppy.

 It's how you form the balls by folding the dough. The bread book illustrates what to do. Sorry about that.

**I have included pictures on how to work with the dough on the imgur page**!!! 




 My boyfriend and I go through at least a dozen store-bought in a week. After looking over all the ingredients, I decided homemade was the best way to go! If you're interested in homemade breads, The Bread Bakers Apprentice is a must! We make 2 -2lb loaves of French Bread every week instead of buying bread for sandwiches, toast, etc.

It depends on the work environment, but I always enjoyed lunch breaks. 









 Great read. Thanks for the post! :-) 




 That, I did not know. Since this was a new article, I felt it worthy of being posted. Others might agree.  




 o_O? 




 I never understood the obsession other women have over diamonds and always felt it was a marketing scheme. Turns out my intuitions were right.

In today's world, a lot of marketing can be seen as a scheme. Hell with all the photoshop enhanced pictures, even what is perceived as 'true beauty' is a scheme. Unfortunately a lot of people fall for the hype. 

I didn't post this for intentions of 'clickbait'. I share stories I find interesting, and with other people. That's what this sub-reddit is all about, whether or not you agree, or approve, of the post. 


Edit 1: Typo 




 I couldn't think of a creative title.  














 HA! My mom puts these on cars back in the 90s! And yes, the same one! 

 




 Thanks. Nice username, too.  









 They're called fraternities. Or the greek community, in general.  




 He's really nice once you get to know him. Someone in town created a facebook page and people post stories and what he is up to, on a daily basis. Plus, he's open to having his picture taken with his doll.

I do not know a lot about him, but I've been told he has a job and a home. There are a lot of homeless (and mentally unstable) people in town, but he has a lot going for him, dispite his circumstances. 




 Don't hate what you can't understand.

There's a guy in town who pushes a doll in a stroller and often wears womens clothes. Turns out his wife was killed a few years back and its his way of coping - also schizophrenia (sp?) but it was caused by his loss.  




 Try 8 years. Just can't tolerate caffeine (sp?) or carbonation.  




 Rope Burns is the chapter in the book Million Dollar Baby for which the movie is based.  




 Really? That surprises me quite a bit. I worked at a food bank for a while and they'd receive 'damaged' merchandise. Once FruitLoops (sp?) sent them a large shipment of cereal b/c they left out one color.  




 If you're driving to buildings such as Snow Hall -since you can access the back of the building even if campus is closed - there's no way to not drive on campus.  




 I found it ridiculous since it happens everyday and the crosswalk isn't that far from their houses. 

Clearly this sort of thing happens all over campus, but that's a heavily trafficed area. 




 Wow, can't take a joke? Sorry I forgot to add 'JK'. 

I served my time as a part of the  greek community , so I thought the generalization fit rather well.  




 But then you'd be at fault for running over/ hitting a pedestrian, even if they deserved it. Could you live with that? 




 And not a true graham cracker, unfortunately. Didn't know that until I had received a cookbook a few weeks ago as a present. One of the last recipes is for graham crackers and it even includes information about the origins! 

Sorry, I do not recall the title right off. If you're interested, I'll provide that later.  




 I suggest going on a self-discovery. Spend some time finding out who you are, why you do the things you do, and what has led you to where you are today.

I've spent the past year doing this and just this week, I finally found the answer I was looking for. It wasn't easy coming  to terms with it, but I now know why I behave the way I do, today. 

I wish you the best of luck! :-) 




 None of you are correct, it's To-Puke-a.

 




 Try to avoid properties owned by First Management. They'll keep your deposit if you forget to clean one measly light-bulb fixture and if anything happens to break or stop working, you're better off paying someone to come out b/c it will be weeks, if not months, before FM actually steps in to help.  




 It's not just frat boys that participate in this sort of 'douchebagness'. If a journalist wanted to show the true impact of alcohol, dig deeper instead of asking one group of guys - and their girlfriends. 

KU has had a number of problems concerning sexual assault - date-rape drugs dispensed at parties, passing out jungle juice instead of beer....there's a long line of problems and this article didn't touch on anything besides 'hey I like to get wasted, blackout, wake up with a girl I don't remember from the night before'...and replay the next weekend.

Edit: minor typing errors

 




 Clearly they wanted to paint a perfect picture of getting plastered - bros before hoes. I posted this because I thought it was f*cking ridiculous. I've been to frat parties, I've seen what happens, and this story didn't come close to the reality that unfolds at a typical party scene.
 









 Extra dirty, please. Oh, and don't forget the olives!

 What videos would you suggest for beginners? 

My boyfriend and I are interested in doing yoga together. Unsure of where to start, I was hoping /r/yoga might have a few tips. 




 A good memory isn't necessarily genetic. It, like all forms of learning, requires repetition. 

Math is a necessity in life. Especially if you want to excel in todays world. 


Binary Coding = Math

Physics = Math

Computer Science = Math

And the basics:
Econ, Accounting, etc.


I grew up hating math because teachers used a method I never understood. Let me rephrase that. It was something I wanted to understand and would tell them that they needed to actually show me how to do it, not just tell me. It clearly wasn't something they could handle. A week after my first college math course, I finally understood what I hadn't years earlier b/c someone took the time to explain it to me in a language I finally understood. Since then I have loved math.


Also:
Instead of just teaching math, teachers should provide real-world examples of it being used. If you want a student to appreciate what they're doing, actually show how it will benefit them later on.

Edit 1: Spacing

Edit 2: Rewording 




 Or at least actually benefiting the child. My mom only used what she received to ensure we were up to date on the latest name-brand fashions.  




 They were on sale at the supermarket for about $60. 

Oh and they were served steamed with butter for dipping! :-)
 









 Groups of teenagers, sometimes younger, would walk into the store and always leave without buying anything. Took management a while to figure out why.

There were no security cameras by the condoms. They would grab several packages and leave. I was well aware of what was going on, but didn't care. 
 




 I've always set too high of standards for myself. Eventually leading to the point of seeing specialists to know why I do these things. I understand it's human nature, but when you're constantly comparing your own acheivements to others, it leads to a more depressing approach on life. 

 




 Oh hey the new line of Star Wars toys. I was so excited to see these last time I went to Petco!!! Too bad the employees weren't as amused, seeing a 20-something customer playing with dog toys! :-P 




 I know one of the rules says to not include Facebook. I chose to go against this for the fact I found her post very uplifting. By blurring out the name and pictures, I hope that will allow this post to remain on /r/pics.  




 My 'mother' used a wooden mirror. It hurt like hell.  




 From a rural part of KS here:

I was always told to call the police and ensure the individual following was, in fact, a police officer. 

Otherwise, floor it and go.  




 Ahh man, beat me to it! Props to LFK!  




 Ugh, hit me right where it hurts.

The only problem with this is the fact you have no come to the realization as to why you are unhappy. 

My childhood was a complete sh*t-hole, so finding that inner-peace as an adult hasn't come easily. I am lucky enough to have found someone whom I love and want to spend the rest of my life with. The only problem is the fact that I'm still broken, inside. 

Oh the journey's life throws our way..... 




  Being denied entrance into a national park is nothing compared to not receiving WIC disbursements in order to, you know, survive. 

 
























 I have that cup....and the entire set!!

Cute hedgehog, too! :-) 




 Seeing how it's KU's colors. Yours fits rather well.  




 Never knew this form of art existed. It's amazing and beautiful!  




 I was so excited when I bought my new phone and failed to read through the details. From now on, I won't be talked in to purchasing it. I might actually point out how much of a scam it is to the store employee. 

Mailed my phone to Cell Phone Repair (CPR) store. Hopefully the estimate won't be too much. It of course broke AFTER I got back from the city that has the store. Unfortunately, I do not want to make that 1.5 hr drive again. A sh*t load of construction + college students = a bad time. 

It's a Google Nexus 5. :-) 




 The answer is yes, but more so no. 

Via a close-friend who is a former Orthodox Jew. 

Shmuley Boteach is such a schmuck. He just wants to sell Orthodox Judaism in a way that looks hip and cool and to make Orthodox Judaism seem less like...Orthodox Judaism. What he doesn't say is that you have to ritually wash your hands before and after sex, the man has to recite certain psalms before entering the woman, and that it is *best* to be covered with a sheet or blanket, which means that you kind of have to do it in missionary otherwise a sheet will slip off, and why would you do it a different way if you could do it the *better* way? The man also has to wear his kippah during sex. Now, Shmuley isn't Chassidic, but we were Lubavitch, which means the woman has to keep her hair covered during sex. Oh, and sure, the "niddah" period during the period and for an additional week leads to lust, but don't you sometimes want to hug each other? You can't share the same bed during that time? The woman can't even SIT on the man's bed during that time so as to not arouse him. You cannot pass things directly to each other and you have to put something on the table when you sit together to serve as a reminder that you cannot touch or pass things to each other. You cannot even pass a baby to each other. Sure, *sets it next to my hand on counter*, then I pick it up.

Edit: forgot a few words.

 There comes a point when smoking too much can revert your problems with PTSD. I had that happen and had to stop smoking. 




 Husband yelling at wife for never doing anything right. Wife gets up, crying, and leaves. Husband and daughter remain at table. Husband then decides to call and yell at his wife. 

I sat there trying not to notice, but they were seated directly across from our table and in my line of view. My Dad asked why I didn't speak up and say something, I was the only one at the table who heard the commotion; I didn't want to piss off the Husband and receive an unnecessary bitching. Felt so sorry for their daughter. Unfortunately she might be used to it.

This was at a fancy restaurant in Plano, TX.

 




 That's what I worry about happening.  




 I agree. But furthering an understanding and appreciation in art, at a young age, wouldn't be a bad thing.  




 TL;DR - too much THC with no experience is likely to make you sick. 

Does not necessarily mean the brownies/cookies were laced with other drugs.  




 She makes an excellent point, aside from the modern critique. 




 She makes an excellent point, aside from her modern art critique. 




 Through 23andMe I started to question whether the individual I came to know as my Dad was in fact my biological father. Turns out I was right. I never brought it up to my parents because we were going through enough stress at the time. 

Mid-August, my Mom finally came clean with the information. She was legally responsible in telling us (as stated in court documents) and withheld this information from us for over a decade. The documents permitted her to release the information once we (myself and my siblings - two older brothers) reached 18 years of age. I am the youngest and now 27. I laughed when my Mom brought out the legal papers. She asked why and I told her I had figured it out months ago. She was upset I never mentioned it to her, and I wish I hadn't waited. 

I know who he is, know where he lives. I even know and have is phone number. I've called at least once a day for the past few weeks, but no one answers and the call goes straight to voice mail. I wonder if they have caller ID and decide not to answer (so I often call with an unknown number) or his wife deletes my number (which is screwed up seeing how she's a licensed psychologist - yes, I've done my research). Either way, I have had no luck.

One thing I really find unnerving is ~~that~~ the fact I always wish I had a sister. Turns out I have two older half-sisters and one half-brother. I had a third older half-sister but she passed away in 1983. My middle name was in honor of her. 

Would it be wrong for ~~my~~ me to leave a message on their answering machine or messaging him over Facebook? I want to meet him. Based on what my Mom has shared, we have a lot in common; and what I have discovered through my own research.  As a kid, I always brought up ideas and concepts that my Mom thought were stupid and I finally understand why - it's something he would have thought or been in favor of doing. 

I saw him once, but didn't know who he was. I was 18 years-old and out to eat at Panera with my Mom. After bringing the food back to the table I told her that a table of older men kept staring at me. I do not recall her reply, but once they left the restaurant, she informed me it was him.  




 10-15 minutes and small lawn vs. paying someone $50/week to mow. 




 I've had this happen several times. You stand no chance of finding it because they wash off during a car wash and fall down through the drain. Do what /u/SCUDSMcKenzie suggests and buy a new one.  




 I disagree. Went to this location twice and felt even worse after leaving. That's when I decided to pay the price and see Gina.

Give this place a try since it's cheap, but know there are better options in Lawrence.  




 I highly suggest Gina! Went to her for over a year to treat vertigo problems. Unlike Ad Astra, she's certified through the state. Last I heard, Ad Astra was not. 
 
For pricing, she might accept your insurance or provide some sort of payment options. You'll have to discuss that with her. 

 




 Their company runs ~~though~~ through Etsy (sorry Etsy) and has thousands of good reviews. They must be lies I tell you....LIES!!!!!!  




 Fortunately, on behalf of the company, I have chosen to omit their name. 

edit: punctuation  




 She must not have wanted to admit to poor service by her company, so she decided the 'God + Babies = Whatever point she had in mind.'  




 Touch mi amigo. 




 Her comment undermines the whole point of "God". 




 No worries about taking it personally. I found it so unprofessional that I decided it was worth sharing.

It's surprising (and sad) to see that the email isn't written in a professional manner; never mind the religious-based information. 

Edit: I added a semicolon.  




 Unfortunately she's one of the people in charge of the company.

edit: word 




 Here was my review for the product:

Ordered this product OVER A MONTH AGO and have yet to receive it. Have also contacted the company TWICE and no one has replied.

 They must be been on their way to something else....Not sure what if it wasn't the chase. As the OP stated, the fire was already taken care of.

With all the new inexperienced drivers in town, I was expecting a crash. Too many darn one-way roads.... 




 Wondered what all that noise was about. I live near 6th street and heard a lot of law enforcement drive by.  









 Our cat does all of those. It means she wants treats. Luckily for her she's adorable and we always fall for it.
 




 I always have the two during my morning routine of breakfast and Star Trek. :-) 




 I drink this most mornings and often without feeling tired before hand. As soon as I finish drinking it, I feel like I could sleep a few hours. This even happens after drinking English Morning Tea. I stopped drinking the tea for a while because it started making me sick, even with a full stomach. 

Perhaps I have a different reaction to caffeine. Either way, it is quite annoying.

edit: Removed a word. 




 Thanks for the tip. We actually use all three, depending on which we choose to buy when we restock after running out. I'll definitely choose one of the two next time! 









 My parents hid the fact we were all adopted by our Dad because our biological father wasn't married to our Mom and we would have been a burden to his family (wealthy and prominent in the community). He paid our child support but I never knew of him - in being more than just a past relationship with our Mom.

I found this out last Sunday. I'm 27, have two older siblings, and am now aware that I have four half-siblings.  














 Luckily it's located right up beside the house. So a lawn mower didn't find it, but our dogs sure did. For now we're trying to make sure they leave the bunnies alone. Unfortunately there are a lot of hunting dogs in the neighborhood.  














 Really? Visited KState and KU for a journalism conference back in high school. I always liked KU after my first trip to Lawrence. 




 We'll make it seem like we're not killing you ever-so-slowly by giving you this amazing view as you eat. Enjoy suckers!!!! 




 Please tell me they left honeycomb in at least one jar.

 Forgot to include Burrito King. Great deals, delicious food, and open until 3am.  









 Half moon 




 Taking a picture wasn't easy because the moon would move out of view within a few minutes. Plus lining the camera up with the viewfinder made it even more difficult. 




 Equipment:

SkyQuest 8" scope and 25mm  Orion Sirius plossl

 Sorry for the wait , but I'll ask when I see him later this afternoon! 




 Yes it is!!! It's a half moon! Can't wait to take a picture of a full moon.

 Have you cut open a tube afterwards to see if there's anything left? I get the feeling that some makeup might be stuck to the sides of the tube. 

Either way, that's a great idea. Thanks for sharing!  




 Did you even read the story? His wife did everything possible to not get him deported; but even that didn't work. Now he's banned from entering the US, returning to the life he had lived for 20 years, for 10 years. Sorry, but that's f*cked up. There are more than enough illegal immigrants who could be deported, not someone who has made a life for himself and someone else.  




 Should have posted this yesterday but anyway here's the container. 

http://www.imgur.com/dl8yQXV.jpeg

 




 Welcome! :-) 




 Great opportunity to make a ring! That is if you know how to weld... 




 Unfortunately that wouldn't work. The container isn't the type where you can do that. For now, it's stored in a zip loc bag and should last me close to a month.  




 Or for people who suffer from amnesia. 

Not sure which types would benefit the most by using a cell phone, but it's the thought that counts.

edit: typos and such 




 Might try using a sharp pair of scissors and cut off the end. Or a steak knife. They'll cut through just about anything as long as they're sharp.
 




 Haha, I posted the picture on /r/pics (they weren't friendly so I deleted the post) and someone thought the same thing!  




 I've never tried that, but I wouldn't be surprised. Also, cutting the container(s) open might not be as easy.  




 I deleted the post but I have it stored in a zip-loc bag. Hopefully that will work. :-/ 




 That's a great idea!!! I'll see if I can find any later this week!  




 The container looks flat due to how I held it so I could show what was left. Luckily the sides fold in and it will keep that from happening.  




 Plan to store it in a zip-loc bag. Hopefully that will keep it from drying out.  









 Not to mention it's flat and boring (except in the NE).

Plan to move to Southern California, with my boyfriend, within the next year and say sayonara to Kansas. 




 The Koch brothers will definitely keep it all to themselves.  









 Everyone should definitely buy The Forest. Killing cannibals has never been so much fun.  




 Thank you! I've missed fishing. My step-dad sold my fishing gear once I moved out and off to college. Spending that day at the lake (more so reservoir) with my boyfriend and his dad was so much fun! We've decided to turn it into a weekly adventure (have 7-8 locations to choose from).

Bama as in Alabama? Sounds more exciting that KS...haha.
 









 That I cannot answer. Today was the second time I've gone fishing in over a decade. Someone else might be able to answer your question. :-) 




 In KS (at least where we live) you're allowed 5/ day. 

Also caught a Catfish and a Perch. My boyfriend caught a Drum fish; never heard of that one before today. 














 Disney Stores.....

If not, they're located in most malls.

They sell clothes, toys, music, movies and other Disney trinkets.

The one I went to has a small theater area playing nothing but Frozen. 

 




 You're kidding, right?  




 Stay out of Disney Stores. They have that video and song playing nonstop. 




 Remember when you had to have a college email address to sign up for Facebook? Those were the days. 




 I'll admit their outfits are nice and all, but I love the dress of the lady at the 3rd link in your list. Even after looking through all the competing dresses, it still remained my top choice.
