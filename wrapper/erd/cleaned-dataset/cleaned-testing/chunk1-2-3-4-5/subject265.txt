 I am trying to submit Youtube videos of some of my favorite songs that I think others might enjoy. When I click "submit" it throws up an exception in red text  under the that says "that reddit only allows text posts" I don't understand. The sub is filled with Youtube videos, and I thought music videos were the preferred posts there.  


































 She left her ID near the MoneyGram Kiosk, and found it lying there later.

 Ed and Bob had just landed the biggest sale in their firm's history. Ed knew he had to hurry home to his pushy wife Mary, but Bob persuaded him to have a drink or two at a nearby tavern. Being a lightweight, Ed vomited all over his shirt and tie after only a few. 

"Aww man, Mary is going to kill me Bob. You know she doesn't want me drinking or hanging out in bars." 

Bob, feeling overly confident about their recent victory was sure he had the solution. "Don't you worry about her.  Just put this crisp twenty in your shirt pocket. When she sees the vomit tell her that someone else puked on you, and gave you the twenty to pay for the cleaning." They continued to drink until the Tavern closed and each took their own cab home. 

When Ed arrived, Mary was waiting, furious at the hour, and his obvious state of drunkenness. 

"Where have you been!" Ed was already unbuttoning his shirt. "You're drunk... and covered in vomit! What is wrong with you? I should have listened to my mother you worthless sack of... "

"Now hold on one minute, woman!" Ed drunkenly interrupted while Mary tore through and examined his things. "I can explain that vomit! It wasn't me! A guy down at the Tavern threw up all over my shirt. Look in my shirt pocket, there's a  twenty dollar bill. He was honorable enough to pay for the cleaning." He was already crawling into bed, and pulling the covers over himself. "You see, I'm not always the bad guy." 

Mary held up two twenty dollar bills. " Ed, there was $40 in your pocket." 

Ed lifted up from his pillow, squinted one eye, and tried to focus on her. "Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you. He shit my pants too." 


Apologies for submitting from a mobile device. 




 The CS2X caught my attention on eBay. I read some reviews and it sounds like an underrated instrument that can be extremely useful. Anyone play and/or have one? 




 I understand this wasn't a very popular virtual/sampler synthesizer. I can understand some of the gripes I've come across on forums. Support being discontinued being the biggest. But, I am impressed by some of the sounds this thing can produce. I like that it can be programmed and then disconnected from the computer. I was wondering if anyone had any advice with programming the thing. I've spent a few hours with it, and I'm amazed by the number of parameters and controls the thing has. The multi function seems really powerful. Does anyone have any experience with uploading patterns? I've noodled around with many of the presets, but still haven't found a clear path toward making my own patches from scratch. Is that possible? Any other general advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. 




 I would like the sequencer on the Microbrute to sync up with the Venom. I have both MIDI cables amd USB. I would prefer to be able to sync them without using a DAW as I would like to jam free of the computer. I understand how to use MIDI to control one device with another, but I'm not getting anywhere with sending a clock signal between two. Can anyone help me with this? 









 I have a Arturia Laboratory, a Microbrute, and a Boss Dr-550mkII. Two interfaces , Berhinger Q502USB and a an old Tascam US-122L. Tascam has an in/out so I've been playing with it. I have plenty of cables. I am trying to sync these devices without using the USB connection on the Microbrute. If I use more than one USB connection for audio, the noise becomes unbearable. I want to use these devices separately without one ever controlling the other. Just sync. The Laboratory has a Midi in/out. The Microbrute and Boss have an input only. Is there any way that I can make this happen? 




 I am going to keep this as short as possible. Whenever I have my computer plugged into my mixer via USB, I get a loud, high pitched buzz.  It went away the other night, and came back tonight.  I tried isolating every appliance and florescent bulb in the house with no effect. I'm wondering if a failing HDD could cause this? Maybe the power supply fan? I really enjoyed combining my analog gear with my soft synth. Now the frequencies of both are affected. This noise is driving me nuts!

edit: first I tried lifting the ground on the PC, but that only helped when I used my best cable. (I have several music USB cables) I realize that the cables were in the inductive field of my stereo.  Moved the stereo box and everything went away. Sweet silence. I then reapplied the ground to protect my machines and house. Sorry if I wasted anyone's time. I feel like this has been a useful thread. I learned more than a couple of things. Thanks to everyone who commented. Y'all helped me get into critical thinking mode. I don't get enough of it. Thanks again.  
























 Let me first say I'm open to any input as long as it is budget oriented.

I recently acquired an Arturia MicroBrute, and I naturally would like to expand the capabilities of the instrument with some simple effects (and later some complicated stereo effects). I was looking at Zoom effects first because of the value of their entry level line (and the seemingly ancient Reznor endorsement). 

My question mostly involves the frequency processing of bass and guitar effects. I know there is a distinct difference between these instruments. How confined are these pedals to these frequency profiles? I am a bassist by nature (bass guitarist), but I intend on using the full range of the MicroBrute through looping and sampling. I just don't have much money.

I can shoot some sexy pics of the MicroBrute and my Laboratory 49 if necessary.

 Is it not common knowledge that more than 90% of the veteran's walking around are not active duty or retired and therefore do not currently hold a military ID of any kind? I'm posting this because my university sent out an email inviting everyone to a special football game. The email explained that veteran's and active military get in free with an active ID. Only people who are active, retired, or disabled get an ID. In fact not all disabled have an ID. All of these offers just end up being a slap in the face.

 Did I say they weren't a threat? No, I didn't.

I was simply pointing out the ridiculousness of your assertion that they "almost won". 

Please tell us more about how they were winning before the allies decimated their entire empire. Tell us about how these competent leaders dragged their country and citizens into an unwinnable unsustainable military campaign that ultimately resulted in the fracturing of their country and the nearly total destruction of its infrastructure. 

Tell us how it was an entirely competent decision to wage an invasion against the Soviets. Explain how in their great wisdom and cunning strategic logic they came to form an alliance with a belligerent and ideologically diseased state like prewar Japan, and how that state waged an antagonistic bombing campaign against the United States effectively bringing them into the war. Tell us about these "great leaders".  




 Yes! Thank you. Allying with Japan was also a huge mistake.  




 It's getting really heated in there. I was just asked if I'm stupid because 

Incompetent leaders wouldn't have almost won against all the superpowers of the world. The Nazis were fucking evil, and I am glad they lost. They were competent as hell though.

That's hilarious. 

 




 Are you stupid? 

Incompetent leaders wouldn't have almost won against all the superpowers of the world. The Nazis were fucking evil, and I am glad they lost. They were competent as hell though.

Bwahaha! 

Edit: Sorry, I just got carried away by the ridiculousness of your comment. Please tell us more about how "They almost won against all of the superpowers of the world". 
 




 The Third Reich manifested during peace time. It's not stupid to look at these things with an* honest and transparent attitude. 

 




 No I'm not. And they're often interrelated.  




 They should change the instructions in the sidebar.  




 You are an apologist if you honestly believe that the Third Reich was comprised of competent leadership. Waging a two front war against all of the world's superpowers? Forming an alliance with belligerent bloodthirsty Japan? The fucking Holocaust? All of the backward hateful rhetoric that was used by the Reich from its inception? There are countless cases of incompetence within the party and throughout the war.  









 I suppose you think that "drug dealers" aren't people and therefore shouldn't have any rights?  




 Many would argue that Germany's actions leading up to and during the war were little more than drunken belligerence. During the final days the Reich and the Wermacht destroyed as much infrastructure as they could in order to prevent the allies from using it. It's disingenuous Nazi apologia to suggest that somehow Germany was less responsible for it's postwar state than Greece is for it's current problems.  




 I disagree. You cited one example of a Jamaican citizen and two other black gentlemen who were commissioned officers (a lieutenant is not a senior officer) but were then dismissed to join the Union Army early in the war. The 1,500 or 2,000 black soldiers and three black officers would have been prohibited from serving in the confederacy in 1862 and your source says that 10% of them went and joined the Union Army. 

You don't have an argument. You either don't understand military rank structure or you're willing to ignore glaring contradictions in your narrative in order to maintain it. Three low ranking officers who served very shortly before being disbanded would not have qualified in any manner as "senior military officers". By the end of the war these men would have been American war heroes, not defeated Confederates. But I encourage you to continue your efforts. Maybe while reading about these men and others like them you'll learn a thing or two about how evil the Confederate leadership really was.  




 Don't you mean that Germany was limping for getting into a drunken brawl that they in fact started? Then, once they realized they were sure to lose they began burning their cloths and effects so that no one else could have access to them?  




 When the Louisiana State Legislature banned people of color from serving in the Confederate Army in February 1862, the regiment was disbanded. Morris and about 10% of the other former 1st Louisiana Native Guard joined the Union Army in September 1862 and were organized into a new unit that was assigned the same name. There Morris became the first black Jewish officer in the Union Army. 

Hmm. Got any other great examples?  




 "nor the greedy". So when will Christians start their campaign to disenfranchise and marginalize the rich?

 Yeah, this is a thing. AA is not a [therapeutic] (http://www.propublica.org/article/how-alcoholics-anonymous-can-be-a-playground-for-violence) environment for alot of people. Beyond being predatory the twelve step system is also not an [effective drug or alcohol treatment program, ] (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-alcoholics-anonymous-work/)  it is a fundamental violation of our first amendment rights as many people are pushed into twelve step whether they're religious or not. Jesus is the most common* topic of discussion for many twelve step groups. This is an everyday violation of our constitutionally protected religious rights, but you don't hear anyone stopping or backing up governmental process over it.

Edit: I'm a huge supporter of gay rights, but I feel that all human rights depend on secularism.  




 I chose* this one because (as you can see) this officer proclaims to be a part of a "we"  that has a contract to "clean up the site". If anyone has anything to say about this select group of users "cleaning up the site" this would be the place and time.  




 Started a new sub. 




 Ideally, this would be a place to discuss the police and the bullshit they spew on pns. I would be open to allowing apologia from other corners of reddit as long as we follow the .np and archive rule. No direct links ever! We can't have a simple conversation with people staring over our shoulders and I won't tolerate them. This is designed to be a circle jerk and that it will be.  









 Like I said. Strict rules. No direct linking, no brigading. If you're interested in moderating, get in touch. Otherwise, have fun. 




 Edit: Thanks for your support. Sub is up and running. If there's a way, could you please give me access to those archives you removed. My sub is only for archives and .Np contributions. I've contacted /u/insaneterrorist. I hope that he digs what I'm trying to get going. Thanks again. 


Please direct those users to contribute to /r/shitpnssays. I'll do my best to keep this conversation alive. 




 It's new. The .np and archive rule is nonnegotiable I will ban you. Otherwise, Come one, come all. If you'd like to moderate please get in touch. /r/shitpnssays 




 I don't disagree with you, but hear me out. /r/shitredditsays is a self-professed, unapologetic circlejerk. They ban anyone who tries to stop the jerk and even those who don't want to jerk. They're protected by the rules of reddit because they ban folks who attack the topic of conversation. They describe their sub as a "turd museum". "Don't touch the turds.". That's  cool that you want to change this sub. I'm still planning on starting my sub. I hope that you'll promote on mine as I'd like to promote on yours.  




 I agree. I don't consider myself an expert in theology, but I'd say that greed has been a tool of the leaders of western Christianity for forty or fifty years at least. When we talk about the US, I'm pretty sure we can walk back all the way to the very beginning and see greed as the singular motivation in most things.  




 I just checked it out. Are you referring to all of the memes? Maybe I'll start a ~~/r/shitprotectandservesays~~ /r/shitpnssays later.  




 Yeah that's him. His videos are very informative.  




 Thank you for being so candid. It's not common for believers to speak honestly about these offenses which may not affect literally every church but are extremely common.  




 Is he the body guard guy who always has his lawyer waiting by the phone? His videos are awesome. He really knows what he's doing and doesn't fuck around. Those are how first amendment audits ought* to be conducted.  




 Shouldn't you have included some text or even a source?  




 Yeah I would be more supportive of banning brigadiers and removing the downvote button than censoring content to protect the feelings of a few butthurt piggy-wiggies.  




 What about conversations where officers are flippant about the law, joke about harming people, or blatantly ignore or ridicule constitutional rights?  




 Apparently she's been very clear that has every intention of keeping the position.  




 I guess "cleaning up the site" means* cops brigading any comment that isn't explicitly procop or any they disagree with.  




 Yes it does.  




 She did actually. She did an interview with the New York Times.  




 You're mistaken if you took anything I've said as a defense of American law enforcement.  




 I don't think it's ever going to go away.  




 Kickbacks for RXs is illegal. 

Yet it happens all of the time. Go [here] (https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/) and look up your doctor or some local doctors. My previous psychiatrist who works in a state funded mental health clinic has personally received around $25,000 from pharmaceutical companies. 

You can hurl whatever personal insults at me that you like. I was simply pointing out this very cosy relationship between pharmaceutical companies and physicians. That's fine if you disagree. But don't suggest that I'm crazy or that this issue isn't worth talking about.  




 I wasn't agreeing with all of the statement, but I think people saw that I was agreeing that these men in the picture were fighting for their country, and I pointed out that not all German soldiers were Nazis, can you not see the difference in the two comments?

But yes, you just can't predict reddit logic sometimes!

 









 Thanks for the link. Lots of useful stuff.  




 They are most commonly prescribed to people with mild to moderate depression. SSRIs are not effective for mild to moderate depression. What is so complicated about this?  




 Racial profiling isn't unique to American police.  




 The magnitude of benefit of antidepressant medication compared with placebo increases with severity of depression symptoms and may be minimal or nonexistent, on average, in patients with mild or moderate symptoms. 

For the vast majority of patients ssris produce the same effect as a placebo.  




 Considering that they're most commonly prescribed for cases of mild/moderate depression, I would argue that it does.  




 Where the hell does it say that this sub is only for the misconduct of American police?  




 Does the [JAMA count?] (http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=185157)  




 Yes they actually can. They can receive all kinds of kickbacks and favors from drug companies and simply prescribing medications to all of their patients streamlines and maximizes the profitability their practices. A medicated patient is placated and must return to the office periodically to renew their prescriptions. A renewal is a fast and easy billable visit. 

Edit: forgot two words.  




 Does that really matter though?  




 I didn't say that people didn't matter. I'm just saying that a business closing is nothing like a person dying. It's not even close. If the business closes the people who worked there are free to find employment elsewhere. A dead person cannot. 

Businesses close all of the time. Most close because of causes that are completely out of the control of the organization's leaders. If a bakery refused to follow sanitation codes the health department would shut them down and it would be their fault. It wouldn't matter if they had a religious belief that washing their hands is wrong. If a business is operating on such unsustainable policies as refusing to provide the products and services that they deal in, why should it be a surprise when they have to shut their doors?  




 A business closing down is hardly the same as a person dying. Businesses close and are restructured all of the time. Most don't close as a result of a policy so stupid as refusing to provide the good or service they deal in. The individual(s)  with the* capital can choose to take* their money and knowledge and engage in other business efforts. A dead person can do none of* these things. The argument that businesses are people is as ridiculous as one can be. Businesses are comprised of people and those individuals already have the protections and rights of a human being. Businesses don't warrant some special status as human beings. 

The cake situation, as ridiculous as it might be, is exactly what we're talking about here. That's the real world example.  




 How is that even close to comparable? It's not like it's an atrocity that a baker should have to bake a cake.  
















































































































































 A lot of people (myself included) are fed up with the way that sub is moderated. I'm looking for alternatives that don't arbitrarily prohibit subject material like police brutality/harassment. Thanks in advance for any input.

 Two New Yorkers are driving across the country. When they cross the Texas border the passenger looks at the driver and explains "Texas cops are supposed to be the worst and they really don't like New Yorkers. Let's try to obey all of the traffic laws so we can get through this state without any problems."

They hadn't made it very far when the driver notices a state trooper's cruiser appear behind them with lights ablazed. He quickly puts on his signal and pulls over. The trooper approaches the driver side window and the driver quickly lowers his window, only to find the officers baton smashing into his face. 

"What the fuck was that for!?" the driver exclaims. 

"I don't know how you city slickers do things in New York, but in my state you'll have your license and registration waiting for me when I approach your vehicle." the trooper barks at the driver. Frantically the driver retrieves the paperwork and hands it to the cop, who proceeds to write him a ticket. "Wait right there. " he spits while handing the ticket over to the driver.  He walks around the car and taps on the passenger side window with his baton. Nervously the man lowers his window. The officer quickly strikes him in the face.


"What the hell did I do!? He shouts as blood runs down his chin.

 Reserve deputy Rick Walter was catching up on paperwork one night in the fall of 1992 when he was told to check out an abandoned car near Interstate 55.

He found a 1986 Buick Somerset at the top of an exit ramp about 1:30 a.m., just outside of this southeastern Missouri town that rises above the Mississippi River floodplain. Inside was the body of Angela Mischelle Lawless, a 19-year-old nursing student.

Lawless had been shot three times, once in the back of the head. But when Walter looked inside the car, he couldn't determine exactly how she had died.

"It was dark, and I didn't know if it was somebody just passed out," Walter said. "We opened the door and saw all the blood."

Fifteen years later, Walter, now the Scott County sheriff, sits in his windowless office and lets the Lawless case play out in his mind. There should be little reason to think about it now. Joshua Charles Kezer was convicted for the killing and sentenced to 60 years in prison. The case is closed.

But things just don't add up, Walter said.

Lawless clearly fought for her life against at least two attackers, Walter said, and yet, investigators identified and pursued only one suspect.

There were no witnesses to the killing. No physical evidence - DNA, fingerprints or murder weapon - linked Kezer to the scene. In fact, Kezer's friends and family say he wasn't even in the state the night Lawless was killed.

"People in the law enforcement community and regular people here have told me that they got the wrong guy in jail," Walter said.

So in early 2006, Walter did something almost unheard of in law enforcement: He reopened a murder case that was not only closed, but had already produced a conviction.

The sheriff and one of his detectives began reviewing hundreds of pages of investigative reports and witness statements. It would be a daunting task.

Witnesses were scattered. Fingerprints and blood can be reviewed and retested, but it was unclear what could be gleaned more than a decade later.

None of that mattered to the sheriff, a former construction worker who regularly wears a quarter-size pin that reads "My Son is a Marine." He already knew that if he ever got the chance, he would reopen the case.

"I wake up most mornings and wonder, 'Why am I sheriff?'" said Walter, who was elected in 2004. "I think this is why - to find the truth on this case."

FIRST TO THE SCENE

Everyone called her Mischelle. She was a cheerleader for the Kelly High School Hawks basketball team in Benton, and a farm girl at heart, having been active in the local FFA Organization.

In her younger years, she was a Girl Scout who volunteered as a candy-striper at area hospitals, so it was only natural that Lawless would pursue a nursing degree at Southeast Missouri State University.

"That's what she always wanted to do," her brother Jason said.

In many ways, Lawless was a bundle of contradictions. By her sophomore year in college, she was juggling boyfriends and partying a lot, friends said, yet she remained a regular at the Baptist Student Union.

Though she weighed just 95 pounds, Lawless wasn't afraid to stand up for herself. 



I know this may be pretty well known, but it happened very nearby and has been complicated and painful for this area.

 I don't disagree. But, I think that statistics on poverty, education, and other socioeconomic factors should be the focus of such conversations. It's not like a person's race makes them any more or less likely to commit a crime. 

Edit: inserted a space.  




 I did read it. I was aware of the fact. I don't see how it's relevant. It doesn't necessarily mean he's not a citizen. At the very least he would be a permanent resident. Aside from the threat of deportation, there shouldn't be different laws for immigrants.  




 You make some fine points all of which I'm sure are being debated by the relevant authorities in Sweden and elsewhere. 

I'm not sure about prison being an effective deterrent to violent crime. At first glance, it seems obvious that it would be, but when you look at the socioeconomic and psychological causes of a lot of violent behavior, it becomes much more complicated. It's also worth mentioning that prisons in the US are known for victimizing inmates and conditioning them to be irrational and violent when they are eventually released. 

I'm getting a lot of downvotes here, and I guess I understand. If someone had done something like this to my child, prison for the offender wouldn't be the issue. But my argument is basically that we in US have been locking up anyone and everyone for several decades now. While overall crime has decreased, it's not necessarily a result of our increasingly militarized police or our eagerness to imprison even nonviolent offenders, and violent crime hasn't disappeared. 

There are people all over the world who would argue that what we're doing here is wrong, but we're not going to listen to them. It's up to us to come to our own conclusions. We are one of the least likely to allow any other body in the world to violate our sovereignty, yet we do it to others quite often. If a country like Sweden wants to operate a criminal justice system that focuses on aiding victims, rehabilitation, and preventing recidivism, they have every right to do so and we should let them.  




 Comments that have been deleted by the mods still show up in the count too.  




 I don't disagree that a rapist should spend at least some time in prison, but it's not my decision to make. 


My point is that you and I have no business making demands of the judges, juries, and lawyers of the judicial systems of sovereign foreign countries. The people of Sweden have faith in their elected and appointed officials.  Their system is focused on aiding the victims of crimes, rehabilitating offenders, and preventing recidivism. No amount of prison time served is going to unrape that girl.  




 I'm not saying it isn't. I'm just saying that Americans are so prison happy that they have the audacity to tell lawyers, judges, and juries how to do their jobs in foreign countries.  




 This was almost funny as a red bull commercial five or seven years ago.  




 Meanwhile in the US, we have more people in prison than any other country in human history. We're so eager to throw people in prison that we want to force other countries to imprison their own citizens.

 I think you're confused. You should look at the comment I mentioned. /u/Humboldtblue put contigo777 in his place.  




 I don't see how the title was editorialized.  




 Yeah. They just rounded up and killed millions of civilians, guys. They were no different than any other army. /s 




 Scientology is dying off because more and more people are being exposed to their lies and crimes.  




 What is your malfunction?  




 There's no rational argument that a maple leaf is imitation marijuana. Japanese maples are incredibly common. I can think of some right outside local schools in my town. A police officer who's not a drooling idiot should know the difference between a common tree and an illicit substance.  




 There's a lot to be said about your point. When outside aid comes into a disaster area they're essentially outsourcing local labor and/or materials. Local workers and businesses need to operate in order for the area to properly recover. It's also a bit of a waste to move volunteers and resources so far when there's work to be done in their immediate communities. It's always good to help, but sometimes these projects end up backfiring in unforeseen ways. I've also heard arguments that these sorts of mission trips are chosen for selfish reasons such as getting to travel to exotic or distant locations or even the opportunity to evangelize to strangers.  




 It is. It wasn't a reasonable mistake by any stretch of the imagination.  




 Way to continue to spread misinformation without providing any sources of your own. Did you go on to read about the control group under the influence of alcohol and drugs? The increased risk is almost identical. 

The fact that you're ignoring the data and continuing to demonize the mentally ill is fucking offensive. Instead of relying on your gut feelings and biases, read the data.  




 I was struck by a DUI driver who was going very fast while driving down the road and the cop messed up the report and said that I was sitting stationary at the stop sign. I was literally two blocks from the stop sign. The other driver blew a .343 and totalled my car.  




 Luckily, the many Christian denominations were fearful and disapproving of one another to the point that they allowed secularism to grow.  




 He paid for the DUI hit and run offender?  




 I'm just trying to show another extreme point to help get you guys out. 

These sound like the words of a man who knows he's been defeated. 

You understand that your point of view is the default right? Besides PnS there are literally thousands of media outlets that agree with you entirely. There's no need for your "counter point". 

 




 You cleared all doubt about this with every other comment you've made in this thread.  




 It wouldn't if you were in the district he was taking from and ran out of water.  




 Der. Open our minds? Could you be any more condescending?  




 No, my apologies for not understanding.  




 Like I said, there is no shortage of assholes who think that the government has no business in R    D. I'm sorry if you thought I was one of them.  




 Good on ya. Elevators and trains are rare in much or the States. Mostly there's not a problem, but there are places where it's difficult to discern whether people's actions are a result of their ignorance or their pride. I think that every elevator should have a sign that explains the simple rules of etiquette. Then it can just be a matter of digging your heels into the ground. 

Edit: feeling superior to others is unfortunately still very much a part of the American way. 

Edit 2: I'm sure that as well behaved as they were, I remember these types of etiquette reminders all over Japan. I lived there for two and a half years.  




 I agree, but they aren't going to just disappear. We need to adopt a general policy of at least scowling at them.  




 No problem. I wasn't trying to insult you. I was only being honest.

How about you do your own damn research before you start spouting out garbage on the intertubes. Really.  




 Do you want people to read the words you type or are you doing it for your own sake? 

I'm not saying anything that a 10th grade English teacher wouldn't say to you. I'm on mobile nearly all of the time. Figure out how to get your point across in a readable format or don't bother. That's up to you.  




 I would start here at the [original post. ] (https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/3ck4x6/photographer_imagines_life_filled_with_anxiety/)  




 Yeah, but the average congressperson's life long pension is only $174,000 how do you expect them to raise a family on that? 

Oh wait, the average median household income in the US is $51,000.

How about prohibiting them from earning a private income while drawing from this pension that they both enjoy so much and cannot seem to live on?  




 I dunno. Many of the people I know work more than ten hours a day. Essentially saying that they're lazy isn't a good way to win votes.  




 Hit enter twice to form a paragraph break. Especially when you feel that you've included more than three strongly interrelated topics or just more than one topic. I'm almost always on mobile so I don't get that excuse. 

You want people to read the words you write, yeah?  




 And don't walk down it two-abreast. If a pathway only accommodates two people, you're effectively fucking everyone coming the opposite direction. Have a little self awareness and some common decency.  




 Better yet, don't lend out money you expect to see again. If someone desperately needs money, give it to them or don't. Otherwise don't get involved.  




 Some people think it's okay to treat their own things like shit. So the moral of the story is, "Don't lend out your things if you care about them.  




 Yeah unfortunately, there are people who are so oblivious that they'll still look at you like you're the asshole.  




 True. But no one has ever suggested that we ban privately funded research. There are those who believe that the government has no place in R   D.  




 I don't disagree, but it rightfully pisses people off when they watch wealthy and famous people steal from public resources. Also I'm more for using technology to make these thiefs donate to public funds. No sense in wasting money on some private contractor to sit in his car intermittently for two years which is what appears to have happened here. Some decent cameras and SSDs will do the trick and not just for one* but for everyone.  




 Two or three times a week?  




 TheCalleguas Municipal Water Districtsaid in its complaint filed Monday in Ventura County Superior Court that on more than a dozen occasions since 2013, a whitetruck filled up at a Thousand Oaks hydrant and hauledthe waterto Sellecks 60-acre ranchin Westlake Village.

"More than a dozen" And those were just the times their overpriced PI was around to catch him. 

I'm not going to say that this wasn't a waste of money, but I'll argue that it wasn't a complete waste. Obviously some well placed, relatively inexpensive cameras could have  been as effective as this guy. But someone stealing that amount of public water is unacceptable. Fuck them for the way they did it though. They should have spent $5,000 to receive $15,000 or $20,000 in fines and penalties and then been able to use the surveillance equipment to catch other offenders. 

Edit: grammar and formatting with millions of mosquitoes tormenting me.  




 Where did you get twelve instances? He was sent a cease and desist at least two years ago.   




 That sounds like an effective argument for publicly funded research right there.  




 Honest question, where did you get $600? 









 Paragraphs! Get some!  




 No I did not imply anything. I asked a simple question. If you have to breathe* more into it than there actually is, then that's your problem.  




 ~~They~~ Two of them are being charged with second degree murder.  




 My state is Missouri and therefore only marginally better than *El Salvador. Members of my family who I have never worked for own businesses and employ lawyers. I'm sorry if it offends you that I would take their opinions over that of random internet guy's.  




 I'm pretty sure that what you're saying doesn't apply in my state. I've never heard of anyone suing over wrongful termination here. Every employer I've spoken with about this issue has told me they were very confident in their right to fire anyone at any time. Hell, I had a boss that was two months behind on my pay. Me and four other employees couldn't even get the state to call us back.  




 Yeah cause unions are growing organizations and a growing movement in this country. /s

And yeah it is true. My state is an "at will" state. A private employee can be fired at any time for no reason. In fact, employers who do not state a reason are better off than the ones who do because there's nothing to contest.  




 Poor women do not have access to any healthcare under medicaid. At least not until they get pregnant in my state. 

My insurance covers my routine checkups. It also covers me if something terrible happens that puts me in the hospital and unable to pay. 

Contraception is a preventative treatment. What about this aren't you understanding? Why should married people be required to wear condoms? 


"Wah! I don't want to contribute to something I'll ostensibly never benefit from even if I have benefited from it in the past, and my children will most likely benefit from it in the future. Screw everyone, I got mine!"

Literally millions of people are unable to afford preventative care and end up much sicker than they would have been otherwise. The costs are in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Tens of thousands will die in the states that refused to expand Medicaid solely to defy the president. 

Anyone who thinks that health insurance is complete rip off has never been sick and therefore working on the faulty logic of "it hasn't happened yet, and therefore won't ever happen", or is probably wealthy enough to not be worried about in the first place.  




 They lost the election by a split vote. Purely northern states wanted to impose their will on southern states.

Yeah nothing says tyranny like representative democracy. 


They fired first because they were idiots. 

Belligerent idiots. But yeah, no argument here. 


The seceded because they objected to having no say and no rights in their own territory.

This is where OP dives off the deep end. The Confederate states tried multiple times to force their will on the federal government as well as northern states themselves with the fugitive slave acts. Then they tried to force their will upon the people of Kansas when they contested its formation as a free state. 


By expand you mean establish more states with westward expansion? The North imposed their will on the south which completely violated the basic compact of the union in the first place. 

And how was that? By allowing Kansas to decide for themselves whether they wanted to allow slavery or not? Or by voting in the elections? 


And of course they would want them returned, they were property to them. This would be like crossing a state line and getting your car impounded then sold off because someone else didn't like that you owned it and you got nothing for it. 

Yeah it would be exactly like that if your car was a person you had enslaved and brought into a free territory. 



Slavery is still wrong, and it was a major issue, but it's not the whole sum of all issues. Both sides were dicks to each other. 


The protection of the institution of slavery was the sole reason for the South's secession. I'd have to say that the south were the bigger dicks being that they committed treason, attacked the US, considered owning people as property as the greatest material interest of mankind, and literally everything that the surviving confederates did in the decades after the war. 

Edit: I'm sorry, I thought this sub was about pointing out the factual errors of confederate and southern apologists. If I was mistaken, I'll gladly move on. .  




 Lol. You know as well as I do why that would be* wholly inappropriate. Thanks for the offer though.  




 There *are zero out of pocket costs for contraception because it saves money in the long term. This isn't that complicated. Unwanted pregnancies are expensive for insurance companies and costly for our society. 

The reason people purchase insurance is to be prepared for the unknown. As far as healthcare goes, it's not a matter of if we'll get sick, but when. We've been denying people preventative care and forcing them into emergency departments long enough to know that experiment has been a failure. This is why we pay more than any other industrialized nation but aren't anywhere near the top in terms of care. You're calling me economically illiterate while simultaneously suggesting we continue to dig the same hole we've been digging for decades.  




 I vote for candidates that support the people. In my area there aren't many unions left so there's really nothing left to defend. We do however have violent occupying paramilitary forces that exist solely to protect the interests of the ruling class. I'll choose my own battles, thank you.  




 An "unconfirmed rumor" or a "complete fabrication" on the part of the Baltimore Police Department?  




 Gee, it would be nice if us private employees enjoyed the same luxuries as you jack booted thugs.  




 Yeah, in the private sector there really isn't a such thing as "fired prematurely" and certainly not in the case of committing criminal acts of violence. Private employees can be fired for no reason at all, at any time.  




 Are you suggesting that the benefits that people get from their private health insurance are free? 

Condoms are a form of contraception. The birth control pill can be used at the same time as condoms. 

Your family is sacrificing because you have to provide them health insurance? Well fuck that. I mean, I'm sure there aren't any females in your family right? And even if there were, they shouldn't have access to medical treatments for their lady parts right? That's just not Christian. /s

Your ideas are bad and you should feel bad. Private insurance requires members to pay premiums and deductibles out of their own pockets. You're still just whining because other people don't have to listen to your obtuse point of view and might benefit from a system that is too cooperative for your political tastes.  




 By studies do you mean TV cop shows and Fox news? Because everything from a legitimate source that I've read has said that while the mentally ill are no more likely to commit acts of violence than the general population, they are several times more likely to be the victims of violent crimes like rape, robbery, physical abuse, and assault. But don't take my word for it either.

 You are a police apologist. Why does it have to be the majority? Wouldn't 49% be too much? 35%? 25%? What number or percentage of innocents dead and their murderers never being charged would be acceptable to you?  




 Spoken like a true member of New York's finest.  




 my apologies for not holding the reddit message board in such high regard to be concerned with proper use of grammar. 

Now redditors may be known to make common grammatical or spelling mistakes, but the vast majority of users obviously make at least some effort in presenting their arguments and ideas in clear and correct form. What you've posted in this thread reads like the rambling drivel of an eight year old. Why even bother to post here if you're not even going to try? Why would you expect anyone to take your ideas seriously when you're not even willing to take a few extra seconds in order to present them properly? 
 




 Well stated. Sorry about the confusion.  




  That cop wasn't **just** speeding.

Did you read the words that I posted?  




 I never suggested a majority. We don't need a majority for us to say what is happening is wrong.  




 Could you please clarify what you're saying states otherwise? I flipped through all of the relevant sections and all I saw was the mention that the practice was heavily debated and a bit of anecdotal evidence about the use of the procedure in the Czech Republic.

[Here is an individual who was castrated, released early from prison by then Governor Mike Huckabee, and then came to my state to rape and murder two women.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_DuMond) 




 He learned that one from /u/Humboldtblue a little while ago.  




 I wasn't suggesting that all such incidents were the same. OP claimed that most were armed and therefore justified. I think that both of those claims are questionable. 

If you've spent any amount of time on this sub you would know that we there are countless cases where the police made a judgement call that led to the death of another person, the circumstances were suspicious, and most often the police aren't even investigated. Why should I waste my time collecting all of these stories for a police apologist who has access to the same search engines, this sub, and who won't even bother reading anyway?  




 Did you watch the James Boyd video?  




 Right, I'm sure that officers who are capable of doing the terrible stuff in this video would never do it without provocation or justification. /s 

Edit: It turns out that this man was simply riding his bike in the wrong direction. I hope you choke on a bag of huge diseased cocks.  




 And I guess to you the distinction between a person "being armed" and a person "being a threat to society" is whether or not the police decided to kill them or not?  




 Rich white women do get free contraception.

How do "rich white women" get free contraception, *and can you please explain this without using racism? 


Having bareback sex vs wearing a condom is a lifestyle choice.

What does this have to do with birth control? Who* the hell do you think you are that you can tell others what to do in the privacy of their own bedrooms and in the confidentiality of their doctors' offices? 


My family shouldn't have to sacrifice for either case.

Wtf does this even mean? Your family isn't sacrificing a damn thing. As it was already pointed out by another user, contraception is preventative treatment and is ultimately cost neutral or even represents a net savings. You're just whining because you don't feel like you're adequately getting to decide what others can and cannot do. 

Edit: was breaking a rule.

This is just a bit of what a five minute cursory Google search for "police charged with illegal guns" on my tablet turned up. There have been countless articles about police obtaining, dumping, and possessing illegal firearms on this sub, but I guess if you're only here as a police apologist you're not going to learn anything are you?  




 But yeah. Criticism of speech and cancelling of private contracts would not go against the Constitution. 

Not only that, but the businesses that severed ties with Trump have the protected right to free expression as well, and the right to not associate with or be connected to an outspoken bigot. 

 




 What about the 1st amendment rights of Trump's former business partners who don't want to be associated with an outspoken bigot? Aren't their rights to expression protected?  




 That cop wasn't just speeding. He was driving recklessly, illegally passing, and evading an officer.  




 Says the kid who likes to talk about Mario Kart on gaming subs. 

This insult was much more effective when /u/Humboldtblue used it against you 28 minutes ago.  




 That comes across as very confident. 

How many is "most"? 

Do you know for a fact that they were all armed before the police rendered them unable to speak for themselves? 

Do you know for a fact that they all brandished a weapon or attacked the police before they were forever silenced?  




 The right to bare arms is right there in the fucking constitution. 

Police shouldn't be shooting people when it's avoidable or unnecessary. What part of that do you not understand?  




 Nice.  




 Everything about this comment is fucked. "rich white woman" What the fuck is this all about? 

Birth control is anything but trivial. You consider choosing to have kids all of the time a "lifestyle choice"?  




 So exactly what I said. And your assertion that they were armed before they were shot is also disingenuous as we know damn well that officers like to carry "drop weapons". 




 Isn't New Hampshire the ~~"Give me freedom or give me death"~~ "Live Free or Die" state? Wtf?  




 Armed like [James Boyd was armed?] (https://youtu.be/JwytoxMuk4U) Or the guy who was shot to death lying in bed with a knife?  




 Recently? Women have been coming forward for decades. Now that number is up to 45. 




 There's no way to spin it. Giving mind or body altering compounds to people without their consent is wrong, a violation of their person, and a crime.  




 I disagree. I don't think that anyone should go to prison for cannabis possession or sale.  




 These types of offenders would continue to abuse children even if they were to be castrated. They would probably just become more violent and resort to using objects to carry out the abuse.  




 Computers are just tools and like other tools they made human work easier and more efficient. AI is designed to replace the human element entirely. That's a huge difference with a completely different outcome.  




 Interesting.  




 Of course they do. They don't respect anything that they can't personally buy and own.  




 The South seceded and attacked the north over the issue of slavery. The south wasn't interested in states' rights, but rather their own interests. Yes the north had the more immediate motivation of protecting the Union and therefore it's own interests. That does little to change the fact that the war was started over the issue of slavery. 

Yes slavery was less of a motivation for the Union but there were straight up abolitionists and the abolition of slavery was one of the results of the war.  




 The immediate motivations of the Union are less important considering that it was the South that chose to secede and the Confederacy that chose to attack the US.  




 Right, but in order for all that to have happened, they first needed to be convicted. These are the innocent ones we know about. They're enough to cause concern. What about those who have been executed for crimes they didn't commit?

Edit: [Cameron Willingham] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Todd_Willingham). How many dead innocents would be acceptable for you? What number or percentage do you feel would be justified in the name of political and judicial expediency? How would you feel if it was your loved one or even you on the chopping block?  




 His sworn testimony about slipping a woman drugs in order to rape her has been released. You know that there have been 46 women come out and accuse him of rape, right?  




 [Not rare enough for my taste.] (http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/innocence-and-death-penalty) There have* been at least 154 cases.  




 I understand that you don't think it exists, but you're wrong. Rude? So insulting my intelligence isn't rude? 

This was about drugging women. This is indisputable. Giving someone a mind or body altering chemical without their consent is wrong, a violation of their person, and a crime. 

He went on to drug and rape women. 

The connection is clear. It's not even a stretch.  




 You're the revisionist. Suggesting that slaves were freed by fighting for the Confederacy? If those men were free why would they fight and die defending the instrument of their own bondage? What about the white soldiers of the confederacy who were forced into conscription by the threat of death or imprisonment in terrible conditions? Do you really think that they were happy to be dying to protect the interestes of the ruling class? How do you think a black man in the slave owning confederacy would fare if he refused to fight? Toward the end of the war they were slaughtered in droves for simply not winning. 

The number of black slave owners was relatively miniscule compared to the number of slave owning whites. Why do people always bring this up? How is it even relevant?  




 I know damn well what Spanish fly is or is supposed to be. I'm telling you that this piece is relevant to the fact that he is a rapist who drugs women. Got it?  




 Not to mention that they had no problem using the federal government to force northern states to bend to their will regarding the fugitive slave acts.  




 It wasn't just a disagreement over the power of the Federal government. The South seceded and attacked the US to protect the institution of slavery and therefore the way of life for the Southern ruling elite. Ultimately the south was most upset over the creation of a new free state, Kansas. That and the election of Lincoln who opposed the expansion of slavery into new territories and states meant that the slave owning states had lost most of their political traction and their economic interests would be ignored. The Confederates weren't worried about states' rights when they opposed the formation of the new free state on the basis that slavery was an inalienable personal right that states couldn't take away. They weren't worried about states rights when they introduced and passed the fugitive slave acts and tried to force their will upon northern free states and the federal government who had no interest in capturing escaped slaves.  




 From what I understand, the formation of Kansas as a free state did play a major part of the political situation and the South's secession. Kansas and the election of Lincoln meant more representation for those who opposed slavery or at least it's expansion.  




 I said most. Most people are not rapists whether they spoke about Spanish fly or not. Most people haven't admitted to using drugs to rape women under oath. Bill Cosby isn't most people.  




 Yeah, but most people didn't end up being accused of raping 46 women.  




 I can't watch it right now. What does he say?  




 Have you figured out some way to restore life to a defendant who was unjustly executed? If not I wouldn't be so eager to kill people when we know for a fact that innocent people are often convicted of capital offenses.  




 [This guy was serving a life sentence for cannabis related offenses] (http://m.kmbc.com/news/missouri-man-serving-life-for-marijuana-offenses-gets-relief/33177190) until our governor commuted his sentence. Governor intervention is very rare.  




 I didn't say anything, but I think that OP was saying that you can usually gauge a person's overall understanding and knowledge of the Civil War by listening to their opinions on the causes of the war.  




 How do you figure?  




 The South seceded and attacked the US in an effort to protect the institution of slavery and therefore the way of life for the Southern ruling elite.  




 One of the biggest events that led to their secession was the formation of the new free state of Kansas. The Confederates felt that an individual state didn't have the legal right to prohibit slavery as it was a personal right. States' rights was a Confederate revisionist argument. The war was about preserving the institution of slavery and therefore the way of life for the Southern ruling elite.  




 That's not necessarily true. The Confederate states argued against the formation of new free states and felt that slavery was a personal right. If the confederacy was interested in supporting states' rights they wouldn't have argued that new states had no legal right to prohibit slavery. They also wouldn't have been so upset that many northern states and the federal government had failed to enforce the fugitive slave acts to their liking.  




 I get it. I was simply following the instructions in the sidebar. I'll drop the www next time, but you can't really fault someone for following the instructions in the sidebar.  




 I'll remember to drop the www next time, but you really can't fault people for following the instructions in the sidebar.  




 I wonder why it's so difficult to understand that?  




 Ahh. I see. 

Edit: I thought that you meant that someone in the thread was using the "Stalin was way worse" argument.  




 Which one is that?  




 Victory was made easier by the foolish mistakes of the Reich and other axis members. Their behavior made it very easy for allies to put aside their differences to address the malignancy that was threatening peace and order throughout the world. Germany was never close to winning the war. Japan was certainly never close to winning the war. Their military campaigns were reckless and unsustainable.  




 To a point. But when it's overused it causes economic stagnation and eventually failure. It's not a solution but a blunt tool that can often end up causing more problems than it can fix and should therefore be used sparingly.  




 The US had japan by it's balls because of the battle of Midway. Before that Japan was far more successful in the pacific. Had the US lost Midway they very well could've failed.

That's just ridiculous. The US had suffered no damage or attacks on homeland soil aside from Pearl Harbor. We were entirely intact and just getting started with our military industrial complex. Japan was suffering from repeated effective bombing campaigns and over a decade of economic sanctions and trade embargos. How do you come to the conclusion that "we very well could have failed"? 

 




 While Germany was giving the soviets a run for their money.

Really? Or did they merely succeed in causing the deaths of millions of people before having their asses handed to them, their country burned to the ground, and half of it ultimately seized by force. Let's not forget that Germany's imperialism made much of Eastern Europe vulnerable to Soviet invasion and occupation. 

 If japan had won the battle of Midway and turned around the pacific, ( which they nearly did ) the axis had strong chances of winning WW2. 

But they didn't win, and there's nothing that suggests that the US would somehow have folded if we had lost midway. Let's not forget that the US was brought into the war by the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Do you think we would have just given up and surrendered to the Japanese? Outside of Pearl Harbor, we suffered virtually none of the mass destruction that parts of Asia and Europe suffered. We were entirely intact. Yes the Japanese fought hard but there was never a chance that they were going to defeat the US. By the time we dropped the a-bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan was largely burned to the ground. 

 




 I bet I could conquer several of my neighbors houses with a bit of military equipment. I would be incompetent to do so because it's obvious that the police, the FBI, the ATF, the DHS, and the National Guard would easily take them back and likely destroy most of them in the process.  




 Well, austerity certainly doesn't foster growth.  
























 Thanks for the downvotes.  




 Maybe, or maybe it was the frank and to the point response of someone with a clouded and biased perspective. Did you read the link?  




 People are charged and convicted for everything and anything, left and right. We currently have more people incarcerated in the US than any other country in human history. 

You're obviously biased. This type of reluctance to prosecute is universal in cases involving the police. In states that require a grand jury indictment, the prosecutor purposefully includes evidence that casts doubt on the guilt of the offending police. A prosecutor would never, ever, in a million years, do this in a grand jury hearing involving a nonLEO. Prosecutors rely heavily on police departments to bring charges against offenders. They're part of the same team. They're not going to hold the police accountable anymore than they'd hold themselves accountable. They already have judges, prosecutors, grand juries, and the entire system on their side with everything they do, no matter how depraved. They don't need you on this sub sucking them off.

I'm not trying to be "edgy". I'm genuinely and rightfully angry. These men recklessly killed an innocent child. If we're to have any faith in our criminal justice system or the rule of law in this county, it's imperative that they are tried and convicted.  




 Eternal life after death is not the same as someone coming back to life after dying.

Tell that to the hundreds of millions of true believers. 

It's really not my fault that you couldn't tell a clear joke.

I explicitly asked you if you were joking. It's your fault that you assured me that you were "Not at all.". 

 




 I'm not saying any of this. 

Atheism is not an organized belief system by any definition. If you're a Christian, you're still an atheist in the fact that you do not believe in Thor, Kali, or any one of the other millions of gods that mankind has imagined throughout history. 

There is undeniably a Christian majority in the US, and I just described how they vote. Don't like it? Fine, but that doesn't make it less true.  




 There are those who honestly believe that they will granted eternal life upon their death. Don't test the levels of ridiculousness that others can reach when it comes to their belief systems. 

And again, I straight up asked you before pursuing my point. You had the opportunity to make it clear that you were joking. I can't think of any better context than that.  




 Did you remove the offending link? Maybe put in an edit explaining as much? I'm not going anywhere near those links without some type of assurance.  




 Really? So when they vote for candidates who demonize the poor, minorities, and immigrants they're considering the scripture? When they vote against healthcare reform they're considering the scripture?  




 That all depends on what one considers a state's right to be.  




 [It's Supply Side Jesus!] (https://youtu.be/Gc-LJ_3VbUA)  




 So you're arguing that what is perceived to be a failure or incompetence within the system should restore faith in said system? And what exactly do you mean by failing to execute people? My state executes inmates quite regularly.  




 Then you should have said as much when I asked you if you were being sarcastic. [Sarcasm does not translate well when conversing with strangers over the internet.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe's_law)  




 How about plain old fucking innocent?

[Cameron Todd Willingham (January 9, 1968  February 17, 2004) was an American man who was convicted of murdering his three young children by arson at the family home in Corsicana, Texas on December 23, 1991. He was executed in 2004.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Todd_Willingham#Post-execution_attention)  




 But, yet murder rates are unaffected. Is it possible that yours is a bullshit and/or meaningless statistic?  




 Am I joking? 

What's semi-permanent about death? 

For instance, hair dye is labeled "semi-permanent" because you can cut the dyed hair and eventually your hair will grow out as your natural color. 

Have I missed something about executions? Is there some process by which the state can restore life when it finds that it's made a "mistake".  




 Yeah, at least I'd know and at least I'd be comfortable in the fact that my animals and therefore food was treated humanely and allowed to live a healthy life.  




 You must have figured out some way of restoring life to the innocent people who have been and will continue to be unjustly executed.  




 It's not just private prisons. The whole justice system is biased as in relies on the proceeds from keeping people in  the system in order to cover payrolls and other costs.  




 Ah, the human tax that supports the justice system. The number or percentage of innocent folks that must be unjustly incarcerated or executed in order to have a "just society". The argument that causes brain cancer.  




 The difference is that people were writing about Khan and his doings during the period in which he was alive. In order for it to be an apt comparison, there would have to be no writing about him at all until after his death (which also wasn't recorded). 

I'm not interested in musings and whatnot. I'd like hard evidence like someone who wasn't illiterate having actually spoken to the man and recording his experience, or maybe some secondary sources like certification or tax records.  




 So you've discovered a way to restore life to a man or woman who has been unjustly executed?  




 So murderers can take lives, but they shouldn't have their lives taken away from them?

Maybe you should read the last line again. You seem confused. 

Nobody should have the right to legally murder someone, taking away one's greatest freedom - to live.

Murder is always wrong and the government shouldn't be murdering people. 

 




 Being put to death is semi-permanent,

Is this sarcasm?  




 I have a question. Where was god in SC, when nine of his followers were worshipping HIM in his own house?  




 Personally, I wouldn't be as worried about organic as much as I am about them being able to move around outside and being properly processed. If I had enough property outside of town i wouod already have a coop.  




 I'm going to catch that dog just so I can give it tap water.  




 Yeah but just because he was written about until after his death doesn't mean he didn't exist. 

You're not wrong, but that's still not evidence of his existence, which is what I was talking about. Personally I don't care if he existed or not being that I'm not a believer. I just don't cotton to "historical facts" which have no objective evidence supporting them. 

Pretty sure that same logic would need to be applied to genghis khan if we're being consistent.

Is this true? Did no one write about Genghis Khan while he was alive? I'm going to look that up. But undeniably there are countless cases of evidence of his existence including the DNA of his descendants. 

Edit: On second thought your claim about Genghis Khan is obviously bullshit. The man who began a campaign to conquer the world was written about extensively by enemies and allies. 


 




 Got it. I imagine it's possible that one might locate a local farmer as a source of feed at a more reasonable rate, but otherwise, I can see how it would be difficult to provide organic feed all of the time.  




 Like I said, dipshit, I'm thirty-four. You're not insulting me. You're just making mlre of an ass of your cop apologist self. Go somewhere that people can stand the presence of a kid killer's apologist. Like I said PnS is perfect for you.  




 Go to PnS. There are plenty of steroid shriveled police balls for you to suck on over there. They'll be happy to take your things from you and rape your loved ones, which apparently is what you want. So go fuck yourself.  




 This is who you have patrolling your communities armed to the teeth.  




 Sometimes ~~people~~ police do bad things that there simply are not criminal charges for.


FTFY. 
 




 Oh, okay so now you're suggesting that protocol when dealing with a **potential** gunman is to speed as close as possible and shoot without even really looking at the suspect first. I wasn't aware that the police were being trained to operate as death squads. 

I will not "chill it". I'm not fourteen, I'm thirty-four. This is a clear case of two officers, on video recklessly shooting a child, and letting him die in the grass and snow. If you want to defend these monsters go to PnS. You'll be greeted with open arms by the other murderers and robbers. I'm sure they'll even let you buy them a beer or wash their cruisers.  




 That's all very convenient for these officers, when we have teenagers serving life sentences for being involved in a burglary where one of their accomplices was shot by the homeowner. It seems to me that 85% to 95% of the time, the prosecutor gets the charges and the convictions they want. When the police kill a child in cold blood; "It's too difficult." 




 No first I said "fuck you" and described you as a "bootlicker" and as scum, then you called me an asshole to which I responded in kind. 

There's nothing intelligent about your arguments here. This case has been discussed countless times on this sub and elsewhere. You're not adding anything by wedging your nose directly between the buttocks of the nearest police office. I don't care what you think of me or my opinion. I thought I'd already made that clear. You're defending two kid killers. You have nothing useful to say. 

How dare you insinuate that I support violence against the police or anyone else. I simply pointed out that these officers need to be appropriately punished for their crimes and as a deterrent for all other officers lest they too began to treat human life with reckless indifference. Public canings are a valid type of punishment, used in countries like Singapore and such. Doing this on a live feed who simply get the message out to everyone that killing kids is not tolerated and especially by those who hide behind the authority of a badge. 
 




 You're a complete dipshit. The fact that you're even mentioning risk assessment here illustrates how biased you are. The police did not assess the risk involved in this situation. Risk assessment doesn't include positioning oneself as close as possible without first assessing the risk. 

You need to understand things dont work like they do in movies. 

Right. Tell that to these two gung-ho Dirty Harry wannabes. Don't tell me that. I'm the one arguing that police should follow protocol and consider the safety of everyone involved. 

You're a police apologist and you're here defending the indefensible. Will you be singing the same song when the police kill someone you love? You make me sick.  




 I think the evidence speaks for itself. The police abandoned protocol, recklessly sped as close to the suspect as physically possible, and proceeded to shot him multiple times. They then failed to render aid and treated his child sister like a violent criminal. There are plenty of charges that would be appropriate as well as the charge of murder. They're scum for what they did. You're* scum for defending them.  




 There are* other laws that could apply here. Criminal negligence, reckless endangerment, accomplice to murder before and after the fact. If the DA figures out a way to avoid charging them, it's not going to be because of a lack of things to charge them with.  




 Ohio is an open carry state. So it wouldn't necessarily have been illegal even if the gun was real. The police could have pulled up to the curb and used their PA to order the boy to drop the weapon and get on the gound. Instead they flew in as close as possible to surprise him and began shooting him before the car even came to a complete stop. They then refused to render aid to him as he lay gasping on the ground. They manhandled and handcuffed his younger sister and threw her in a police cruiser. 

Everything about this case is fucked. Both of the officers involved should be stripped naked and publicly flogged before being thrown in prison for the rest of their lives. They're scum for their murderous insolence. You're scum for defending them.  




 Well, in this case he wouldn't have been killed. The kid wasn't even holding the air pistol. They just murdered him because they wanted to kill a black guy. They have to be held accountable.  




 You're the asshole defending two ruthless murderers. As you may be able to tell from my comments here, I think your opinion is shit and could not care less about* what you think of me. Your lack of judgment on this very obvious brutal murder makes it clear that you have nothing useful to say.  




 Yes they're criminals. They murdered a twelve-year-old boy in cold blood. This isn't rocket science. Or do you feel safe with these jack booted thugs patrolling the neighborhood your kids play in?  




 Fuck that. They obviously didn't follow the rules to the point of recklessness and someone got killed. They deserve to be tried. If you can't get that through your thick scull then there are plenty of other subs that would love to hear your valueless opinion.  




 Fuck you. Those cops executed that kid. This is one of the most egregious examples of police brutality, but what do you know, along comes bootlicker here to defend the murderous thugs. We have every right as tax paying citizens to demand that the police follow protocol and consider the safety of everyone around.  




 Yes I have. Oddly, no one had to die.  




 Does that include cases where the officer knowingly puts himself in that situation? Ohio is an open carry state. There's no excuse for what they did here.  




 You charge them both for not following procedure, ignoring the law and the safety of the community, and murdering a twelve year old boy. 

Edit: I'd like to point out that 

Judge Ronald Adrine found probable cause for the charges of murder, involuntary manslaughter, reckless homicide, negligent homicide and dereliction of duty against Cleveland Officer Timothy Loehmann, one of the two officers involved in the case.

Additionally, the judge found probable cause for the charges of negligent homicide and dereliction of duty against Frank Garmback, the other officer.

So OP is at the very least, being disingenuous about there not being a legal basis for criminal charges in this case. This is one of the reasons why it favors the police to drag these things out as long as possible. People forget the facts and the narrative can be skewed in the court of public opinion. 
 




 It's not misleading. There still isn't any justice for Tamir Rice and his loved ones.  




 Latest? This happened long before Freddie Gray was murdered.  









 That's very true. Historians generally agree that there was a man named Yeshua. It doesn't mean that there's solid evidence. I've heard this argument hundreds of times, but I've never seen any convincing evidence. No one wrote about him during the period he would have been alive.  




 Yep. Most of the racists left the Democratic party after the Civil Rights movement.  




 Came here to say that Captain D's is far superior. Fuck Long John Silvers.  




 Yeah, fuck best buy!  




 Sounds like an interesting and depressing class.  




 Yeah. It kind of illustrates how meaningless that award is, doesn't it.  




 East Cape Girardeau is barely even a town. It's more like a couple of trailer parks and a strip club. 

Edit: typo.  




 There's much more to it than that. Read The Trial of Henry Kissingser. The guy's a fucking scumbag.  




 *mortar shell 




 No, Hard Candy is about a young girl who resorts to vigilante justice against the child predators who killed her friend.  




 Can you explain. My grandma raised chickens until all of her kids grew and moved out. I don't remember anything about it being expensive and sure cleaning chickens is work, but I wouldn't say it's the worst thing in the world. If it was expensive I can't imagine my grandparents would have had anything to do with it.  




 Not necessarily. You do have the option of raising your own chickens for meat and eggs.  




 Fuck everything about this. Sounds like another department that should be disbanded.  




 This shouldn't have been deleted. This isn't exclusively political.  




 That's sad. They can't properly celebrate murder with a memorial to the victim around.  




 How the hell does shipping meat thousands of miles away for processing and then returning it save any money?  




 You're a drooling idiot.  




 It may have something to do with the municipality. Walmart gets a lot of money for development and tax breaks from. local communities. I imagine that that some cities want to see a certain number of positions in return for their investments.  




 Employers have every right to prohibit their employees from even using tobacco products. You don't have to be a police officer. You can choose to find work in a different industry.  




 No, your job should prohibit you from using steroids and most mind altering chemicals.  




 Summary execution.  




 Right, without the government there would be multiple providers. Except that's not true at all. Without government there would be one provider still and we would not have the internet. 

 




 What the hell are you talking about?  




 No, it's definitely [corporatism] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatism) responsible here. 

Statism is such a broad term* it would almost seem like it was created for the Republican party. It wasn't. It refers to this:

We don't have that in this country. We have many industries that aren't properly regulated in this and many other areas. We've allowed the ruling class to rule both the economy and the political process.  




 I like what you have to say. I see no reason why a combination of software and hardware can't do better than 80%. That's a disturbing number considering that there are laser corrective machines that basically correct ones vision to 20/20. 




 Yeah let me rephrase that.  




 You're talking about laser surgery. We were talking about laser diagnostics.  




 I would prefer it never had any public funding. I don't care what stupid people do **in their homes and churches** as long as they pay their taxes. 

Edit:added bold text.  




 Violence always begets violence. 

I would argue that fascist policies and horrific circumstances have put religious fundamentalists, who are sometimes also rapists, in power in Afghanistan . I don't know enough about Afghanistan to form the most well rounded argument. If I had to chance a guess about the current political, social, or economic situation there, I would start with the total war that has occurred there in the last forty years or so. Then i would move on to the intermittent and half-assed efforts (if even that) at rebuilding and supporting those people you hate. This dipshittery comes from mostly people you think are superior, they were the major parties from the beginning to our current untenable situation. 

[Afghanistan] (http://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Afghanistan) has a long and beautiful history that is both multicultural and worth learning about. What has happened there is truly horrific. But, it's easy to knock a place and a people because of its current situation. 

I mean the best time to assess the United States and it's cultural developments would have been in the last third of the Civil War, right?

 I have it in my android keyboard. It depends on your platform. Gee, [LMGTFY.] (https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100402193438AA42qqB)  




 I dunno, you tell me.  




 The visual information that comes from your eyes is more fucked up than you think. It's not that we have too many receptors in the middle of the eye, or even the fact that we have an [actual blind spot in the middle of each eye] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_spot_(vision)). As far as I understand it, it's the complexity of the eye's shape, the photo receptors, and how they interrelate to the brain. We unfortunately possess much of the same eye structure of that of a fish. Of course light works differently underwater* and so does pressure.  




 Explain to me OP, how this is more of a failure of the president than it is the legislature. Each time a reasonable bill is presented to properly fund any amount of reform, the GOP dominated legislature slashes and trims it* into ineffectualism. It's convenient to attack the president, but a little research will reveal to you that the bill he supported was defeated and replaced with a joke that provides one tenth of the funding as was intended.  




 Antitrust!? That's socialism!!  




 We have and continue to do so. The depth of that problem is abysmal.  




 Corporatism in action.  




 I wouldn't either, but I certainly wouldn't blame Islam solely for their fucked up behavior and beliefs, anymore than I would blame my mother and her religion for the ku klux klan.  




 No one is perfect. Hitchens was antitheistic. Islam is an easy target. In some locations Islam is the major religious threat to rationalism and secular society. But, in mine for example, Southeast Missouri, Christianity threatens secularism and rational decision making.  




 How do you figure?  




 This kind of shit is why I'm in other threads arguing against blanket incarceration.  




 If you feel it did then I'm satisfied.  




 You should know about [Poe's Law.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe's_law)

I have no love for any religion but I like people and I have a few friends who are Muslim. Seem like regular guys to me. They appreciate the secular aspect of our government and treat me, an atheist, with the same respect and dignity as anyone else.  




 I think I understand what you're getting at, though I disagree with the analogy of eating dogs as there are valid arguments against that, I think I agree with you. 

Really, I am glad they're offended. I'm offended each time a child is taught about hell and how they and everyone they love is going there if they fail to live up to "god's will". I'm offended by their often successful attempts to push religious indoctrination into science class or any other aspect of public education. I'm offended by the mutilation that was perpetrated on me and  the other **billions of defenseless children**. I'm offended by their attempts to subvert our secular government. I'm offended by their lack of humanity, tolerance, and compassion. 

If they choose to be offended by two adults who love each other and want to make it official, then shame on them. They're only showing their own asses. History will not be kind.  




 I've said multiple times that I don't disagree with a reasonable sentence in an appropriate facility in this case. Maybe you should read through the thread a bit before commenting. 

Edit: Since you so cowardly deleted the comment I'll ask your question again and answer it. 

OP: "I don't disagree" is vague, do you think that this ruling might have been correct? 

I do. 

I'm not a Swede. I'm not one of the Swedish caseworkers, judges, lawyers, or jurors involved in this case. I dont know this young man who was a minor child when he committed this heinous crime. I don't know his background, his medical history, or what types of horrors or abuses he was exposed to in Somalia. I don't think that you fit any of these qualifications either. But, now that you're asking me questions again, I'll repeat myself:

Why do you feel like you have the qualifications to argue about this one way or another? 

Why do you feel that this sub is the place to do it, especially when rule 2 prohibits this kind of agenda? 

You know you can go to /r/lolmorbidreality, right? I'm pretty sure that their rules would allow you to hate on anyone you like.  




 I've never worn contacts and probably never will. I don't mind glasses, as long as I can get a prescription as often as I need. I'm seem to be in need of a new pair as lines are starting to slant a bit. I don't understand the allure of contacts. I can't stand touching my eyes and eye infections are terrible.  




 I'm an American. Criticizing the government is what we do. How is it hypocritical to criticize my own government when it is known to be draconian in the implementation of its laws? How is it hypocrisy to appreciate another country who is taking a different approach. Maybe you're confused about the definition of hypocrisy:

hypocrisy

hpkrs/

noun

the practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which one's own behavior does not conform; pretense.

synonyms:dissimulation,false virtue,cant,posturing,affectation,speciousness,empty talk,insincerity,falseness,deceit,dishonesty,mendacity,pretense,duplicity;More

That should clear up any confusion that you're experiencing.  




 I'm assuming that you've only read the two posts that you've responded to. Shame on you. I've said multiple times that I don't disagree with a reasonable sentence in some sort of youth correctional facility. But either way, it's not our decision to make. 

I have a couple of questions for you? Why do you feel like you have the qualifications to argue about this one way or another? Why do you feel that this sub is the place to do it, especially when rule 2 prohibits this kind of agenda? You know you can go to /r/lolmorbidreality, right? I'm pretty sure that their rules would allow you to hate on anyone you like.  




 Cool, thanks.  




 I dunno. Ask /u/abortionaut. He seems to be all for it. I'm sure he'd take a page or two from the works of Adolf Hitler and his Third Reich.  




 I'm not sure what you're getting at. I personally think this kid should have to do a couple of years in juvenile or some kind of Center for youth offenders. But it's not my decision to make. 

What happened to that girl is terrible and the offender needs to be dealt with. I'm assuming you're an American by your vengeful attitude and you posting this shitty article that mentions Anders Breivik as if he was somehow relevant to this case. Perhaps you can put your thirst for blood aside and consider the long term consequences of incarceration and what goals are ultimately meant to be achieved.  




 Fine points. I agree that education needs to be the foundation if we're going to effect any real change in the US. More needs to be done to eliminate the root causes of poverty itself, which are manifold. I know a lot of conservatives like to cite welfare programs as creating a culture of dependency, but I think that's disingenuous. 

We have for several decades, fostered a very lucrative black market for several plants and compounds that we know will always command a certain level of demand. Instead of allowing criminal individuals and organizations to profit from these markets we should decriminalize, legalize, and heavily regulate even the most illicit substances. (It's ironic that the federal government still views cannabis as one of the most dangerous compounds known to mankind) A good example of the effects of sufficient regulation and taxation would be the [trend of teen smoking] (http://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/adolescent-health-topics/substance-abuse/tobacco/trends.html) over the last forty years or so. 

I know this may sound simplistic initially, but it can be done. And yes, I'm talking about the legalization and heavy regulation of stuff like heroin and meth. You may or may not know that in much of the country we already give addicts methadone and other analogues to heroin in very strict and supervised environments. Methadone is not demonstrably safer or less addictive than pharmaceutical heroin. Hell, methamphetamine is a prescribable medication under US law, and we prescribe Adderall and other amphetamines to children (which I do not advocate. I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy and ineffectiveness of our draconian drug laws) 

If all of these things were reasonably and inexpensively obtainable under rationally controlled and supervised conditions, it would render black markets unprofitable. In the meanwhile, we can actually address the problems by requiring counseling and offering treatment to addicts. Dismantling the drug cartels and offering a safe and controlled environment for addicts takes them out of their comfort zones. I can't imagine many people saying to themselves "I've never had it so, I'd like to go down to the clinic and try some heroin or crack". But, I'd prefer that if they felt that strongly about it, they had access to a clinic with mandatory counseling and safe conditions rather than being fodder for pimps and other types of undesirables in flop houses and whatnot. Prohibiting drugs puts drugs in the hands of criminals. I hear this argument in regards to gun legislation all of the time but rarely do I hear a rational proposition for dealing with our country's drug problems. 

 




 I'm not sure what you're getting at, but what does race have to do with this?  




 I don't disagree, but there was no murder in this case.  




 Where in the text does it say that we have an inalienable right to own and bear assault rifles or even pistols?  We have a Supreme Court to interpret the text of the constitution. I'm not accusing you personally of this, but I think it's odd how some find it convenient to forget the way the system works when they're faced with a ruling that they disagree with. 

All of this hullabaloo about gay marriage is extremely odd to me considering how it literally affects no one but LGBT people and their immediate families. This has absolutely no effect on Christians, their churches, or their closely held beliefs.  




 Let's hope she finds a better job in a substantially less hateful environment.  




 We do. And we have a longstanding court defined by that document to interpret those rights. They've ruled some fifteen times that, while not explicitly mentioned in the text, the right to marry the person of choice is covered in the protections enumerated by the constitution.  




 Christian conservatives and other prolifers.  




 He* grew up in New Madrid, MO. That's just down the road from here. My grandparents lived there for a time when I was young.  




 It seems kinda sad. I know they were violent criminals, but I didn't realize that they would be denied a proper grave this way. Not that I'm saying it's wrong. It's just surprising.  




 I've experienced some of that. The last time I got a new prescription, I hadn't been wearing glasses for a few months because they were broken. When I received the new pair my tablet appeared to be a slight trapezoid instead of perfect rectangle for a couple of weeks. I had to be careful going up and down stairs. Thanks for the info, Doc.  




 Nor should marriage lose its privileged state. The sanctions and privileges afforded to married couples are there to support social stability, family planning, and child rearing. I can't think of a single reason these things shouldn't be available to gay couples as well as straight couples. It's good for families.  




 If it's an issue of a personal inalienable right, which the right to marry the person of choice certainly is, it's not up to the state whether it should be allowed or not.  




 Marriage is a legal term. It's been one for quite some time.  




 No you're right /u/abortionaut. We should look at statistics on crime and race, ignore all other socioeconomic factors at play, round up the offending ethnicities, and put them in camps and deport them. /s

Edit:grammar  




 I'm glad it offends him. He like everyone else, needs to learn that we as Americans do not have a right to not be offended by things, and especially not the freedom of others.  




 Which is right up Rand Paul's alley.  




 That's nonsense. Race doesn't make a person more likely to commit crimes.  




 So they give out that information to visitors?  




 I have astigmatism and slight nearsightedness and it seems like they can never get my glasses right. I put up with it and just wear them. My wife is the same way. Would I be better off just asking for this procedure? Is it expensive?  




 Looking back at your comments, I'm curious as to why you chose to focus on that study while ignoring the definition of recidivism provided at the top of the page in question. 

Recidivism is one of the most fundamental concepts in criminal justice. It refers to a person's relapse into criminal behavior, often after the person receives sanctions or undergoes intervention for a previous crime. Recidivism is measured by criminal acts that resulted in rearrest, reconviction or return to prison with or without a new sentence during a three-year period following the prisoner's release.

Is it because this very relevant definition hurts your argument, and the study works as a fantastic distraction from that fact?  




 Who said anything about giving anyone a pass? I'm saying that it's wrong to suggest that someone is a criminal because of their religious background. Not that it's okay to assume* that everyone who is religious is a criminal or to give anyone a pass. I guess I could link to the strawman Wikipedia article here if I wanted to be a condescending jerk.  




 Did you even read the article?  




 Excellent article. Priceless photo of Trump.  




 What's conservative or short sighted about opposing an ideology that is inherently anti-women and anti-gay? 

You mean like Christianity? 

 




 Are you suggesting that there is racial profiling being perpetuated against white folks?  




 It's not exactly accurate. It isn't a person's race that makes them commit crimes.  




 Interesting post. I was surprised to learn that these graves don't even have names on their markers. I understand the purpose in burying them in this manner, but shouldn't the families still allowed to locate and visit their deceased loved ones?  




 I don't disagree that culture is part of it. But it's difficult to tackle the problems presented by cultural backgrounds without first addressing poverty, education, and other socioeconomic factors. It's not like one can strip a person of their cultural background nor should they. There are absolutely aspects of some cultures that are harmful to women and other minorities. It's a difficult problem to address. I guess the idea is that once a person or group is appropriately educated and raised from poverty, these other issues should take care of themselves. I don't disagree that there is a certain amount of assimilation that can and should be expected from immigrants entering a country.  




 It's not relevant as I am an American and have every right to expect to have a say in the functions of my Democratic Republic. I'm not saying that you can't have an opinion about Sweden. I'm saying that it's unqualified and valueless so don't expect anyone to listen to it or care. You have no authority there. Not even a vote. 

You have no reason to label me a hypocrite. 

And I will continue to live in the US and vote in every election cycle, thank you very much.  




 Why would I be arguing about Saudi Arabia? How is that relevant to this discussion? 

I'm comforted by* the fact that you have no authority on* any of these topics and cannot enact your draconian will upon others. 

You didn't address the fact that here in the US, we frequently toss juvenile offenders into adult prisons where they are habitually beaten, raped and otherwise abused for much of their adult lives. I'm assuming that this fact doesn't bother you. 

Please don't talk to me about morality or what is just.  




 This "man" was a 17 year old juvenile offender.  




 Again, you're missing the point. Without a control group, like people who received community service and probation, such research only shows part of the pictures. 

Also this study has no effect on the definition of the term. An offender doesn't have to have spent time in prison in order to be considered a repeat offender. That's just obvious.  




 It may not be common knowledge, but those suffering from mental illness are statistically no more likely than the general population to commit acts of violence. The truth is that* the mentally ill are several times more likely to be the victims of violent crimes like rape, robbery, physical abuse, and assault. 

I don't think anyone would argue that this crime is excused by whatever psychological issues he may be experiencing, but there's no question that such things should be considered during sentencing.  




 That's one study. Not all research on recidivism would only follow exprisoners. That would be a mistake as there would be nothing to compare the recidivism rates of prisoners vs other types of punishment.  




 recidivism


\ri-si-d-vi-zm\noun

:a tendency to relapse into a previous condition or mode of behavior;especially:relapse into criminal behavio

It's generally used to describe a return to criminal behavior. Obviously we shouldn't be returning people to prison who haven't done anything wrong, right?  




 I am American and I firmly believe our system is worse than backward. It's completely counterproductive and criminal in and of itself. Our penal system has a long track record of making criminals more depraved and incapable or rehabilitation. 

Sure just punishment is warranted, but you could hardly argue that throwing juveniles into adult prison to be abused, beaten, and raped to be "just punishment" without some serious cognitive dissonance. What's the point in punishing offenders in a way that denies their humanity and violates our own? It doesn't change the past, and the end result is an offender who's more fucked up psychologically and less capable of functioning and participating in society.  




 The duty is to all of society, not only the immediate victim. Yes prison is usually necessary in the case of rape. I wouldn't argue with that point. I will argue that's it's not your place or mine to decide what judges, juries, and lawyers should do with a juvenile offender in their own sovereign state. If Sweden prefers the focuses of their criminal justice system to be on providing aid to victims, rehabilitating offenders, and preventing recidivism  then that's their right.  




 If anything, recidivism rates should be higher in a system where only the most serious criminals end up in prison in the first place.


I'm not convinced that Sweden has such a system. This offender was a juvenile under their legal definition. For better or worse this is why he avoided prison time. And why would they be higher? Recidivism is about reoffending not about returning to prison.  




 If you're not willing to rely on facts or provide any sources, why do you insist on being involved in this discussion?  




 You're assuming so much with your statements. First and foremost, you're assuming that you have the knowledge, understanding, and authority to be making decisions about what should be done to this juvenile offender in a foreign country. Because he's an immigrant you're assuming that he's not a citizen. 

I don't disagree that a sexual offender deserves prison time. But I don't assume to be qualified or justified in telling a foreign sovereign state how to handle its internal affairs.  




 I don't disagree that there should be a focus on protecting the innocent. But it's not up to you or I to decide whether this juvenile offender is likely to reoffend or not. What are they going to keep him in prison for the rest of his life? That doesn't seem appropriate or necessary. 

Also, your comment violates rule 2 in the sidebar which I politely invite you to read.  




 From the way I understand it, Breivik will most likely be in prison for the rest of his life. That 21 year sentence is the "punishment" for his crimes, but the way his sentence works is that the state can choose to keep him behind bars if he's deemed to still be a threat to society. 

Edit: It's worth pointing out that Breivik and his crimes were in Norway.
