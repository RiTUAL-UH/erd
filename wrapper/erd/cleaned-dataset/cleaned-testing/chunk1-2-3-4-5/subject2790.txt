 Was completing a History exam at uni last year. Had finished my first essay question and was taking a little rest before starting the next one.

I looked down and there's a fucking wasp crawling up my top! I had a silent freakout as any noise would have had me kicked out. I swiped the bastard off my top only for it to land on my leg. I then knocked it onto the floor and stomped the shit out of it.

My history tutor happened to walk past at this point and gave me the weirdest look. Really wanted to write an explanation on the exam paper. 




 Jean Grey.  




 "I know what you mean. We'll be all down from early evening so if you decide to pop down I'll see you there, you can give me goss from Blackpool lol"  




 Aged 3/4 I was out at a pub with my family for Sunday lunch. A larger gentleman came in and proceeded to use the fruit machine. His size must have offended me as I immediately turned to my mum and yelled* "MUMMY HE'S FAT!"

My poor mother had to apologise to the man in question and I happily went back to devouring my meal. 




 Vanity Fair - I studied it for my advanced higher dissertation and I struggled to read the book critically as I enjoyed it so much. I still count it as one of my favourites.  




 Philtrum - The space between your nose and lip where it curves. 
























 Some films or TV shows. I remember watching Juno a few years back and crying at the end; I don't even remember why. The worst part was I'd already been laughed at by my mum for crying at the end of Breakfast at Tiffanys (who leaves a cat out in the rain like that?). 




 Community.  




 Using a throwaway account for obvious reasons for the daily reminders now about payment but want to make sure we can all get along to Newcastle in one piece of paper and I have been together just over a year ago. 




 How have I never noticed that?? I really need to hit up IMDB more often.  




 My NSis and NMum do the same. They keep calling FH by his university nickname - he graduated in 2012. He's told them before he'd rather go by his actual name but "That's what he was introduced as so that's what he's getting called."  




 They're the worst, at least bees have a purpose. I actually passed that exam which was amazing considering the panic attack I had following Waspgate. 
























 A bright yellow puffer jacket. I loved my gran but sometimes she picked the most horrendous gifts.  




 [This was taken on Saturday, before a friends engagement party.](http://imgur.com/PBUDuVm)

 I can't pose but I'd just had my hair coloured and was showing it off. 




 Most offensive, it starts out ok but then turns into a cacophony of hours. 




 I know, that's why I wasn't sure whether or not to message them again. I don't want them to feel pressurised, it's the delivery service who would be at fault. It's my first time receiving a gift from out of the country and I wasn't 100% sure what the average delivery times were either.

Thanks for advising me about the username issue, I didn't know if I could change it. It sounds sad but I didn't want to lose my trophy haha. 









 Went to go see The Voices with a few friends. We all work in a pub, some bar, some kitchen. There's a scene where Ryan Reynolds puts Gemma Arterton's head in a fridge. I turned to my kitchen trained friend and said "What's he doing? Raw meat goes on the bottom shelf!" 

She broke down in laughter and I heard snickering from behind us. 
























 I almost drowned when I was 3/4 years old. Until then I loved swimming but it took 3 years for me to even get out of a kiddies pool after it and any attempt to take me for swimming lessons would result in me screaming the place down.

I've never properly learned how to swim, I can do basic strokes but not for long periods of time and can't tread water. I'm still wary in deep water, it freaks me out if I can't see the bottom. 




 The sound and feel of polystyrene rubbing together. It's the worst part of opening packaging. 




 Writing anything in pen. I'm not sure about anyone else but if I have to write for extended periods of time I end up with a massive stain on the side of my hand. 




 I curl up under my covers, plug my earphones into my phone, stick on Spotify and shut out the world. 




 Although I'm with you on supporting the mages (Meredith be crazy!) Orsino is not the nice kindly elf he appears to be. During All That Remains it becomes apparent that he has been at least assisting Quentin with his "research".  




 I second your opinion on Vivienne. On my first playthrough all I could think was "what a condescending, snobby cow." As such I missed a lot of her dialogue because I never took her with me.

After playing again and actually listening to her I realise just how hard she had to work to attain her position, and although her and my Quiz will never agree politically, I can still respect her opinion. 
























 I headcanon that as First Enchanter he's always been able to perform blood magic but never done so publicly because of the (justifiable) stigma around it. By enabling Quentin he had an outlet for these practices until he hit that point at the end of the game where he saw no way out. Not defending him though because it was really messed up, and further justifies everyone's concerns about mages. 




 Are you talking about the POP figures? Because looking at your link those are Fallout 3 figurines. 

Am I missing something? 




 This manager is still in charge of our TripAdvisor page, every reply is littered with errors like this. IMHO it makes us look really unprofessional but the higher ups don't care so she's left to it. 




 Your/You're 

One of the managers at my work was tasked with our advertising for Mother's Day (UK) and displayed signs all around the pub about "treating you're mum to a Mother's Day meal." I cringed so hard the two weeks they were up. I have a problem with this sort of thing. 




 Omg yes! I'm currently at uni and have just started bringing my laptop in to take notes as it is too awkward to write anything by hand. 




 Not had slap on the ass but something similar. I work as a waitress/barmaid and this particular night was on the bar. The pub was quite quiet at this point so I was chatting to some punters. Bear in mind I'm 25 and these guys were easily in their late 40's. 

So one of the guys asks to buy me a drink, I said no as I was working but if I saw him in the pub when I was off I'd remind him. I then promised "hand on heart" that this would happen, while placing my hand over my chest. He took this as an opportunity to lean over the bar and make a grab for my chest "just to check (I) even had a heart." I leapt back and laughed it off, told him he'd just have to take my word for it and went back to work. I told my manager later what had happened and he told me to let him know if anything like that happens again.
