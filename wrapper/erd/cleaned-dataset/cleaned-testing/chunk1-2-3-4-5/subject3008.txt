 That's how mine occur. During daytime naps. 




 Hell yeah! I was watching that the other day. Awesome thermos. 




 Wth? What are the odds you'd be browsing this thread after that particular comment? 




 Forget reasonably priced, I'd like one to start with. Damn Mississippi is so behind the rest of the country. 




 I haven't read any t replied just yet but I'm gonna say what's probably been said, time machine or a device to simply alter the speed of time. 




 KFC double down isn't available here, such sad. So much sad. 




 I love the peanut butter twix 




 I buy em here in Cleveland MS all the time.  




 I do this. Idc who watches. Be jealous.

 I've got my bed next to my computer desk and my desk is at the right height so my computer is perfectly level. My tv is a few feet from the foot of my bed. Talk about perfect laziness. All my favorite movies and shows are on my computer which is connected to my Blu-ray so I don't have to even get up to change the movie. Ultimate laziness. I even keep a couple snacks and bottled beverages bedside. 




 I'd buy $100m worth of bacon and burn it on live cam and upload it all over the net. 




 Not if he finds this and knows it's you. 




 About once a month or so, I have a recurring dream. Though all the details aren't exactly the same, the main plot is. The dream: I'll be minding my business going along dream world doing whatever when all of a sudden I'm a couple feet off the floor just floating there. I can control where I float to pretty easily. I'll usually float around for a few minutes enjoying myself. After a while a sudden blanket of fear over comes me. The only sound I can make is a wailing banshee or ghost like sound. I hear it in my dream and out loud. My wife wakes me up because it freaks her out. By the way, I can not mimic the sound while I'm awake, it's a way higher pitched sound than I can consciously make. My question to you Reddit is can anyone help me understand what could possibly be going on? Also, has anyone of you experienced anything similar? 




 Anna Gunn. Why not?  




 "White's only pies!"+ runs and eats scalding hot pie. 




 I had one of those blow up pillow fight things or whatever. You put your fist in and beat each other senseless. I immediately felt regretful. 









 I believe I have something like that in both my ears 




 All I can say about most of this is, yes some customers are dicks. The thing is most of you are complaining about customers doing regular customer stuff. Customers have every right to pay with whatever method the store promises to accept. Customers shouldn't put money in their mouths out bras or whatever it's gross. If a customer wants to use a coupon that isn't expired and they have the product the coupon promises to cover, then you can't be mad at a customer for holding up the line. It's not the customer's fault if some stores punish cashiers for slow time. A lot of the comments on here are ridiculous. Maybe you should find a different job. I worked retail and ran into the same stuff. What was different for me? I actually know how to work in retail. Stop complaining about customers being customers. That's like saying babies shouldn't cry or dogs shouldn't bark. If a price rings up wrong and a customer complains about it there is a great chance they aren't accusing you off fixing the wrong price they are being human and just blaming the nearest person. Not everyone that comes through your line thinks like you. Some of your customers have never worked retail, they only know what it's like to be a customer. You find certain things to be "simple" or "common sense" but that's because you're around it all the time. I bet some of your cruddy customers find other things to be "simple" or "common sense" that you might not immediately do the same wary they do. Customers are the reason your job exists. 




 People are stupid. That's what self check out is for. ;-) 




 Not everyone can see well enough to see the menu board until they reach the front. Though I do understand the frustration. 




 Not sure if it's been said but seems like a drop off intended for someone else to find. Maybe it's been too long since breaking bad ended. Either way, pretty cool. 




 That's that hurry up and wait mentality that I miss. 














 I would also have been scared if an Apple iPhone was crawling out of a sewage grate too. 




 I still would love to know how I make driving annoying when he is the one who can't follow the laws and almost caused an accident 




 Because he was in the right by running a stop sign right? 




 I have plenty victories i just don't like being cut off and almost being rear ended when he should have stopped like he was supposed to by law 




 I wasn't in a hurry due to being late i was 30 minutes early. I just didn't want to wait for the last minute to clock in 




 It was a school bus without passengers. You should have read everything 




 Darn it sucks you think it's lame jcravenw, because I posted this just for you. Simple does not equal lame. 




 The taco shell was lop sided 




 Also my thanks was more of a "I'm glad someone else enjoyed one of my all time favorites.  




 I wasn't taking someone else's credit. Like I said. I've not seen it on here so I had no one to credit on here. I've been telling that joke for years. 




 It's a joke. If you don't understand that then maybe you just need to unsubscribe. 




 I don't look at r/jokes all the time. Actually the day I posted that joke was day one. I don't know anyone who looks for the content they're about to post to see if it might be a repost. Plus just because you've seen it doesn't mean everyone has. Reposts give new subbers like me a chance to see the content. 




 Hr ripped someone off. He doesn't want his son to think it's okay to do that. 




 Thanks 




 Little Johnny likes playing hooky quite often and he hides in his mom's closet until she takes a nap. One day he plays hooky as usual but today a strange guy comes over and he and Johnny's mom have sex. Right as they're finishing up johnny's dad comes home early so the man hides in the closet. The following conversation occurs:
"It's dark in here, huh?"
Shut up kid, I'm hiding.
"Wanna buy my baseball?"
No, shut up!
"I'm gonna tell my daddy on you for what you were doing to my mom"
Fine! I'll buy the damn ball if you shut up. How much?
" 300 dollars"
No way I'm paying that much!
" I'm gonna tell"
Fine, ya rip off! Here.

They swap the money and the ball.

A few days later the strange guy is back at it and Johnny's dad comes home early again and the guy hides in the closet again. The following conversation occurs:
"It's dark in here huh?"
Yeah. Shut up.
" wanna buy a baseball glove?"
No. Not this time.
"I'll tell daddy"
Fine. How much?
" 700 dollars"
No way!
"Yes or I'm gonna scream"

Needless to say, they swap cash for glove.

The next day Johnny's dad asks him if he wants to play catch. Johnny says "that'll be hard to do without my ball and glove." And his dad asks what happened to it. Johnny explains he sold them for $1000.
Infuriated, his dad brings him to church to confess.
He puts Johnny in the booth and the following conversation occurs:
" it's dark in here huh?"
Don't start that shit again you little rip off! 




 Lol. I thought I was the only one. I also put my sack of fast food on there to keep it warm. 









 Yes. Mine is active anywhere there are a mass of people that I don't know. Like if I go to taco bell and the lobby is  full of people particularly in line. I just leave. So yes, a church or a library would trigger it. 




 Oh and I understand "tit for tat" quite well. I grew up with petty siblings, lol. 




 Well I'm glad you've done your research. I'm also glad you've found peace. I just don't see it happening for me. I panic in crowds and that panic makes me frustrated. I will probably live the rest of my life this way. Thanks for the concern. Oh and I am aware that my response isn't much but if I yawn one more time I won't be capable of seeing through my watery eyes. 




 Thanks for the kind words but I never mentioned hating anyone. I hate eating around big groups of people or being around big groups of people. I have been diagnosed with social anxiety. 




 I get the same way. It's like I'd rather die of utter starvation than to be around a bunch of people. I don't care what it is, I wont eat it if there are people (especially ones I don't know or rarely see). I'll be thinking "Ooh there's cake.... *goes to get cake* wait, there's people.. lots and lots of people... fuck it, there's a slight chance there'll be some left" to myself "RETREAT!" 






















































 I love that store. I always go there when I'm at the mall. I love cookies. Makes me happy to eat cookies. 




 Congratulations! Merry Christmas. Good luck with the new house. 




 I want mine to get pregnant too. It's also been difficult. 




 Wow I got all misty eyed. That's sad. I'm glad she was able to see you really enjoy your gift first though. Wow. 




 My wife experienced something similar around that age. Her and her younger sister both woke up around 3 or 4 am and cried because no presents. Their parents had been waiting for the kids to fall asleep and ended up falling asleep themselves. When the girls ran to their parents and were sobbing, they were convinced Santa was just late. After the girls went to bed, both the parents rushed to the hiding spot for the presents and rushed around wrapping them. 




 Same for me. Got married on Halloween. 




 It was 2004. I was walking with my brother "C", his girlfriend at the time "M" and her best friend at the time "B". I was about 16, C, M and B were all about 14/15. A beat up old blue/rusty car full of ghetto looking 30 something guys pulls up next to us, I was on the outside of the group closer to the road. I told everyone to go ahead, these guys looked aggressive. The guy in the passenger seat told me to move and let him get a better look at "her" gesturing at M. I told him fuck off and bring his old ugly car to the junk yard where it belonged. He pulls out a very large pistol and waves it sound and then aims it sideways at me threatening to shoot, the rest of the group had already made it to M's house. I ran and he fired one round and missed then they peeled out in a cloud of smoke. I told my dad about it immediately and we got into his big truck and chased them down. Dad shot at them and they ran off the road. Btw we lived out in a very rural area and the entire police department was friends of my dad. I never saw that little blue car again.

TL;DR: Perverted "gangstas" in old car tried to get to my brother's girlfriend and they ended up getting shot at. 




 Glass bottles full of habanero hot sauce. Bottle brakes and cuts the target. Hot sauce burns open wounds. Win! 




 I had a job as a correctional officer at the local state penitentiary. Loved going to work. I had two regular days off but I would have worked those too if they'd let me. I never took personal time off so it just kept accumulating. It paid pretty poorly for that field of work but I didn't care. I absolutely loved that job. I made a minor mistake in paperwork and was fired. It really sucked because that job had potential.  




 TL;DR: born, lived, expects to die one day. 




 Each episode is exactly one hour and four minutes apart. 11:00, 12:04, 1:08 etc. This is only relevant for the episodes I scrolled through. I'm certain it's relevant to at least the 7th or 8th episode.

 Christmas isn't Christmas without a real Christmas tree because of the smell. I don't care for the artificial crap either. There has never been a more Christmas smell for me. 




 I've tried this twice and the first one it did not guess after asking 60 questions. The first was Greg from Hay Day. It guessed Johnny bravo 




 I hate mountain dew. That crap is horrible. 




 Not do the stupid shit that caused me to lose my job. I probably would have continued to pay off my debt with my dad. Oh the good ole fantasies of paying off debt.

 Most of the stuff I read on this thread doesn't bother me but when I got to the sleep paralysis thing, I say nay nay. I suffer it enough on my own along with some PTSD sleep dysfunctions. I don't need any help making it worse. Goodbye to this thread. 




 Just realized most everyone here is mentioning age. I'm 25 btw.

 Commercials: Not ALL commercials, just some. If your product is actually worth anything, if it does what it should, great. Advertise the Hell out of it. I could rant about poorly advertised products all week. I'll list an example or two but there are many commercial styles that bug me. Amazon kindle paper white. The commercial where everyone is using it and one person compares the brightness of it to the brightness of the iPad (whichever version). I'm not a fan of Apple products but I can't stand complete and total lying in advertisements. They show both tablets screens and the iPad screen is really dim and the kindle screen is really bright. Words pop up near the iPad the read something to the effect of "The iPad is on". They are insulting the intelligence of the potential consumer. As though we wouldn't realize the iPad's brightness setting is all the way down. The kindle is a great product and can hold its own, in the market. No need to blatantly insult my intelligence and lie about the competition's product. If I had to choose one of the two products I'd go for the kindle if they hadn't produced that commercial. Now I would choose neither because I still don't care for Apple. Now example 2: The wax vac commercial. This style commercial is moronic in its own way. Sticking a q tip in one's ear canal might hurt a bit but I've never experienced or witnessed someone experience pain enough to cause me or anyone else to scream as loudly as he had. "OUCH!" really? Tone it down a bit. If your product is as great as you say, don't make alternate methods look terrible, just make it known your product is better. Be factual about your product vs the other one. Like the viewers have never used a Q Tip.- I'll end this here. 




 Or: keep running all the way. Stay in the Army, you miss it like crazy. You'll regret ruining that opportunity. Everyday, wasted on regret. Every moment, hating yourself. If you stay college is still in your future. 




 Don't get involved with her, just stay in college. Avoid serious relationships until you graduate and find an appropriate career. This way you won't end up unable to be qualified for federal student aid until you pay off that fucking Sallie Mae loan. Then you won't be broke and on Reddit because you have nothing better to entertain yourself with. Also, you won't end up owing your dad and step mom 3 grand and they don't show up at your wedding because you owe them money.... got off track a bit but y'all get the point.

 The season after season 8 of Scrubs. They call it season 9, I call it a pitiful excuse for a sad attempt at a spin off. 




 Would be funnier to do this to the cable/satellite set top boxes because then they'd have to boot up. 




 I've got a better one than my last. I'd be wearing nothing but a tattoo and a smile. Drive like 50 mph over the limit and when a cop pulls me over, just sit completely still and quiet. When he goes to his car to call for backup just climb to the back seat and lay in the floor incase he comes back and tries to reach in the driver's seat. When backup arrives, if they open the doors to search, just slowly climb out of the vehicle like nothing's going on. FUCK THE POLICE!  




 Gotta love hooch. 




 Or switch items out like Pillsbury biscuits for store brand or vice versa. Margarine for butter. 2% for whole or skim. Splenda for regular sugar. Tea for coffee. Etc. 




 I'd hold a hundred dollar bill down on the sidewalk and move it when someone reached for it. Like really far and fast. If they got it, they could keep it.  




 Yo momma so fat she walked past my tv when I started a Lord of the rings trilogy and missed all of it..... twice 




 I'm a guy and I can do that. It's all about memory. I remember numbers very well but I suck at math. 




 I have this same problem. It really brings me down because I'm as harmful as a light breeze. You can't tell them anything like "I'm harmless don't worry about me" because it only makes things worse. They'll never know you're harmless. I'm a white guy and this is tough. I couldn't imagine being a black guy built the way I am, I'm sure that'd be harder what with the way society had deemed black guys as bad news.

 It may not interest you, but my wife carries a diaper bag that doesn't look like a diaper bag. We don't have any kids. Lis of pockets of various sizes. She loves it. 




 I have three brothers. In order of males, it's me, Chris , Paul, then Brian. As the oldest male, I always expected certain things. Like I figured when the time came, my dad would teach me to drive a car with a manual transmission, but no he only taught Chris. There have been other things in life such as this which have caused me to resent Chris but this one caused me the most because it's one of those father son bonding things. I'm also named after my father which one might think there'd be a stronger connection with father and son, but no. So in response to the original question, driving a manual transmission personal vehicle. 




 I just want cellphone signal bars with a triangle next to them. (Roaming symbol) and the words "the after life".  




 Shoplifting and torrenting. I've got about 20TBs of torrented data most of which I seeded to a 20+ seed ratio (good guy torrenter). I have about $1800 in merchandise from various stores in my house. Things included are countertop appliances, such as juicers, electric skillet, steamer, etc. Blu-ray player, a stack of Blu-ray discs and dvds. 20 1 TB  hdd. I'll stop right here. Let it be known I've stopped and don't plan on continuing the shoplifting. It's boring. 




 Go to sonic drive in. Order the bacon double cheese burger (number 3 here) add bbq sauce chilli and slaw. I order without mayo because I don't like mayo. This burger is the messiest burger I've ever sunk my teeth into and so very tasty. I'm slobbering on my pillow thinking about it. 




 This entire town. Fuck the not hiring my broke ass. Fuck their not having a movie theater, or decent mall. Fuck off Cleveland, MS. Fuck off Bolivar county. Fuck off 38732.

 A thousand upvotes to you. 
























 Agreed. They are a fashion statement around here (where I live. Not Reddit). People wear them around their necks. I assumed the design insinuated headphones, but apparently they are neck wear 




 No, BCGs take that honor. 




 Then my brother would walk around naked. no one wants they. Trust me. 




 My comment was a Scrubs reference. 




 Man is the only animal that wears pants during twosies. 




 I didn't think about that. Hmm... well good luck to anyone with that issue. 




 Thanks so much. I completely understand that. Worded perfectly 




 /r/milf 




 I do this too, though now it's just memory. I don't even think about it. 




 I've had trouble with this before. Why should I respect you just because you were born long enough before me? What's that have to do with respect? If idk you, fuck you. You have no claim to respect just because of your age. You could be a no respect deserving asshat and I should respect you because you've seen the 18-fucking hundreds? Fuck you. You might be a child diddler. I don't know. Fucking old people. 




 One other thing, how do we as humans know what animals see? How do we know certain animals can see x amount of colors more than we do? If a. We can't see these extra colors
b. We can't see through the animal's eyes
Then how do we know? Or how do we know which animals see in color and which see in black and white?
As far as I know, in reality, animals do not speak our language. Animals can't just say "I see in black and white" or "how many colors do your eyes acknowledge? Mine acknowledge x amount more. Lame human" It just baffles me.  




 I don't get total blindness. It might be due to the fact I was blessed with sight, but the idea of total blindness eludes me. The brain processes everything. What process replaces sight when one is blind. There must be something the brain "sees", ironically. Is it total darkness? The eyes must tell the brain something. There can't be no message from the eyes to the brain. It just doesn't make sense. The crazy thing is, I completely understand being completely deaf. Sound doesn't make it to the brain. What happens to visuals between the eye and the brain? Where does the image go? Does the brain just tell itself that everything is pitch black? 




 I have friends I've known for many years that have been music nerds since Jr. High school and some since elementary. They try to explain it every time I ask. After they finish, I remember why I don't ask. They explain it to me the same way they'd explain it to one another. Every time I'm like "Explain it like I'm slow because with this, I am." Still, they explain it like I know wtf is going on. 




 When I was very young I was taught that if you put your hands in front of you and make an "L" with each hand, the one that looks like the letter "L" on paper, that hand is your left. If the "L" you made looks like it's backward, it's your right hand. I hope this makes sense and helps.

Btw, your hands must be facing away from you so you see the backs of them. 




 I know the feeling. My dad has a great inner compass. Couldn't have passed it on genetically? Jerk! 




 We had those little bags of milk in school... I hated it. I'd end up poking the little straw all the way through and wind up with milk everywhere. I HATED it!

 I don't see this one on here so: congratulations - blue October 




 Working on my car successful or not. Whether I appear frustrated or angry. I'm actually happy deep down. 




 For me, it's my beard.  




 I wish I read this comment before my last reply. My step mom and your dad would get along except she's difficult on the laundry too. 




 My step mom was like this. Pissed me off. 




 When I still lived at home, I was allowed to stay as long as I needed but my parents (dad and step mom) had to be able to view my bank account at any given time. This was not a problem since I don't buy much anyway. My problem was the confusion in this rule. My dad said "You shouldn't just go to work, come home, go to work come home and so on. Anyone who works should reward himself every payday with a little something. Even just a
cola on the way home from work." Which I did... then my step mom, within minutes of the purchase, would call my cell phone and bitch me out her : "What did you buy just now?" Me: "I stopped and got a soda for a dollar twenty five" her: " You're supposed to be saving so you can move out!" Me: "I suppose a dollar and a quarter will prevent that huh?" Her: "that's not the point, you need to save everything! You'll never make it on your own if you don't learn to manage your money!" Me: "so a dollar twenty five per week on myself is poor management? Hmm, then with that logic, I'm not as bad as you and dad right? Because a hundred dollars every other week going out to eat has to be worse financially" her: "Don't let it happen again!" Call ends. It was like having two different bosses. Ridiculous bullshit. 




 Oh, my God! I'm gagging and vomiting at the same time. I'm... I'm gavomiting! 




 Wow I thought my wife was the only one. She gets mad if I don't understand what she's talking about our if I'm confused. 




 My wife does this to me... when she pinches really hard, I react with an "ouch" or something similar and she gets mad telling me she didn't do anything.  




 If it's only meant to be viewed on internet exploder, then it's a waste of time. Also, the coder must not be aware of the fact that ie's last few users are mostly people's grandparents who will soon die. 




 My car battery had completely died and lucky enough for me, I had the cash to buy a new one. My car is a 2004 Chrysler Sebring 4 cylinder, 2.4l. With this particular car, you must get behind the wheel well of the front left (driver's side) tire to get to the battery. I got about half way through and it started pouring down rain. I couldn't leave everything as it was because my tire could get stolen or my newly paid for battery could get stolen. I'd be in some real problems then. Anyway, I couldn't get the tire to line up with the bolts so I could put the lug nuts on. I was getting frustrated. Cars and people passed by without even looking at the situation. Had it not been pouring rain, and about 30 degrees Fahrenheit, I would have been fine, but I was freezing and soaked. This guy finally stopped and told me to jack my car up some more (i thought it was already up as far as possible). After a few minutes of that, he had it all lined up and tightened the lug nuts so I was ready to go. Btw, I normally don't have trouble with this stuff, just cold rain makes it seem more complicated.

Tl;dr: I was putting my tire back on my car in pouring rain while it was 30 degrees out (Fahrenheit) and after an hour someone came and helped. 




 Yeah it feels weird and I feel if I say something it'll ruin the moment enough, she'll stop with the head. 




 What's pink and red and scratches at glass?

 Dell computers. Fuck Dell computers.  




 Yeah and ie is the best browser and bing should be your search engine... 




 I use MSE (Microsoft security essentials), it came with my computer. It does okay but only with full scans. If I do a quick scan, it doesn't find anything. I use the paid version of MBAM  (malware bytes anti malware). Mbam detects lots of stuff that mse detect. Mse find things mbam misses and vice versa. They work great together. No conflicts or anything. 




 I have ccleaner and use it weekly but I never ever ever ever use the registry cleaner. Fuck that. I only mess with registry keys individually. Ccleaner can clean temporary files only. On my computer at least. 




 I keep a usb drive with chrome install file handy. So it's actually so simple. 




 I remember him.  




 Seriously, a program called scorpion saver. Anything related to it. It'll interrupt plenty of important tasks and processes. I was updating a beta version of a game and it was constantly getting stuck at 30% and I uninstalled scorpion saver completely and the update worked. 




 My Wife's grandma's computer looks like this. Makes me cringe. 




 Falcon nw is awesome. Expensive, but worth it. The only pc I've ever owned that I didn't build was a Mach V from falcon. Still have it. 




 I hate Dell. Eww. I'd fall off the internet if Dell was my only choice. Also, I second the build your own pc thing. I've always owned personally built PCs 




 Trojans 




 My brother hates this too. My dad would purposely rub his hands/feet on the carpet to bug my brother. 




 Even worse for me is anything sticky. If I get seated at a restaurant and the table is sticky... no no no no. There is this dive bar here called "Hey Joe's", the tables are covered in news paper and magazine articles and sealed with a clear coat. Idk what happened, but someone fucked up, the clear coat is sticky. It's dry, but feels sticky, I refuse to eat there. 




 Fudge pops bother me more than popsicles. 




 I've never told anyone this but bare mattresses feel weird to me. Makes me cringe just thinking of the texture. 




 I didn't see this one but: The Purge. 




 It's like wiping peanut butter from a shag carpet. It's never truly gone. So I use wet wipes after tp. 




 I love them all. Anytime I go, they're having this deal where I think you buy five get one free or something. I usually do this twice and add 4 chocolate chip cookies for 25c each. I end up sick to the stomach pigging out. Worth it! They have this almond crunch one, little bitty almond pieces on a soft chewy cookie... heaven. 
























 I second the whiskey thing. Just don't be cheap with it. I HATE cheap financially and cheap tasting whiskey. 




 I mega-loathe this. I'm always thinking or quietly saying "Parking spaces are for cars you incompetent asshole! Quit fucking leaving your carts in parking spaces. Lazy fucking pricks. There are cart returns just about every few spots. Stop being dicks." I hate those people. 




 Yes on the first one. No Aaron Paul for me please. 




 Breaking Bad. Well just for Skyler. 




 Yes. Poor me :'( 
Financially, I'm poor.

 Married here. You've got a lot right. Except you have all of it wrong. Well we fight. Who doesn't enjoy a good storm off? Seriously though. We try like crazy for her to get pregnant but with no luck. Well there is luck... bad luck. 




 Having the use of a crazy old guy and some punk kid's time machine to bring a sports almanac back to myself and make a fortune from betting on sports. 




 I have sleep paralysis almost every night. Sometimes it includes a demon of sorts and sometimes it's just the paralysis. There's been times where it's a guy that's about as big as Arnold Schwarzenegger back in the eighties. He usually hides in the corner of the room dry humping a bed that only exists with him. He wears a hat like a drill sergeant. Other times it's an evil presence without any shadow or physical appearance. The evil presence is always accompanied by a feeling of something weighing me down like pressure on my chest. There's been times where it's a shadow that whispers my name. I end up asking my wife if it was her though really I know what it was.
When this happens I watch comedy on Netflix to clear my mind and get back to sleep. I discovered new (to me) comedians like John Pinette with this method.

I'm not sure if it's related to sleep paralysis, but I have dreams accompanied by sleep paralysis like symptoms at the end of a dream. Such dreams involve me living life as usual and suddenly I'm transported to a different place. This place is usually a desert and it's usually dark. I can only see about a five foot radius around myself and everything else is pitch black but not like night black but sharpie marker black. I just start floating around and of course I find it fun... at first. Then I float to this area that has like prison bars behind me. I can't control the floating anymore and it's creepy. I then hear a little kid's voice whispering and screaming all at once. The kid is whisper screaming "help me, please!" "Please help!" I turn around and behind the bars is a little kid, terrified. The kid's eyes are just eye sockets and blood drips down from the sockets. I scream a very high pitched scream that can be heard in the waking world. It's a scream I can not mimic while awake. Before my wife wakes me up, I'm paralysed the same as when I have a more standard sleep paralysis episode. 




 Fuck! I now have more shit to worry about visiting me.  




 I have sleep paralysis almost every night. If this image came to me, then I would just die. Fuck that fuck that fuck that fuck it. Nope nope nope nope nope nope. 




 I've thought about this. I would have a two bedroom apartment what with the extra money. The food and what not wouldn't be a problem refer to extra money above. With two jobs a piece, no time to hate one another. Outside of work I'm usually with my wife somewhere outside of the house anyway. Plus it's just a fun thought. 




 Get a 100% clone of myself so I can work two jobs and so can my clone. No more money problems. Since I don't spend very much money, I'd have a lot saved. 




 I just let them go. If you don't like it, too bad. I pass people everyday that do far worse than something that occurs naturally such as farting. 




 I have man's jeans (I don't mean those bs skinny jeans either) and my pockets suck ass. 




 Seconded 




 Or why they're traumatized when seeing a deer carcass being skinned in the front lawn. 




 I'll sound like a noobbut I don't care. How to properly delete a Facebook account? 




 I take this to be a breaking bad reference. I may be wrong. 




 If I could change things. I'd change how a lot of stuff happened. I definitely wouldn't be so stupid to lose my job. 




 Hopefully 2014 will have less government shut downs than 2013. 




 I haven't read all the comments on this, but I think I'm the only one or at least one of the only ones who understood the reference. 




 Makes plenty sense to me 




 I recognized the reference right away. I have watched that movie so many times. Just watched it again last night. 




 I was ranting in traffic about this. Most people can use a blinker without even taking their hands of the wheel. It takes very little effort. Stop being so damn lazy! 




 I put my foot down. I go away from the light as swiftly as possible. Passengers in my car tell me to slow down like I'm in the wrong. 




 I hate this with a passion. If you wanted to be in the outside lane, you should have been in the proper FUCKING LANE TO BEGIN WITH! Fucking assholes! 




 I know someone who does this. He justifies it with "if I just go, and there isn't a gap won't I get hit?" "Stopping instead of driving into traffic that's moving more than 70mph seems logical." Can anyone help me explain an alternative? 




 My carrier has a plan that lets you pay $20/month I believe and you get 250 calling minutes and unlimited text/picture messages. If the calls are made to and received from a phone on the same network or during nights and weekends, it doesn't count toward your minutes. Perfect for being contacted by potential employers. 




 It's not always someone who couldn't afford them from the start. Sometimes the parents could easily afford having kids and have no trouble doing so. It only takes one financial catastrophe to change the whole situation. I know people who financially had no issues supporting kids and had a financial crisis. Now they have welfare and food stamps. They aren't at fault for things out of their control. Not every family that is struggling to raise kids on poor income are at fault. Not to say that some people are just being irresponsible. 




 I do that a lot. Most of the timethey pass. 




 I know someone who bought the waxvac. It was only good at disappointing. 




 Try to get a savings account built up that consists of at least three months of bills (rent, utilities, cell phone, car insurance/note if necessary and any other bare necessity bills). This is important in case you lose your job. I was homeless for three months after I got laid off from my job. Took me by shock.  




 Don't be afraid to make your friends pay to stay if they plan to stay more than a month. 




 I had those before. Ate them in one sitting. No shame was felt. 




 Me too :-D 




 You monster! How could you say such vile things? 




 I went into the court house. We said "I do". 




 Lol that's what I meant. 




 I only do this if someone was halfway in my exhaust pipe
Edit: and decide to pass me like I'm in the wrong for going the speed limit.
Had to edit because I sent a partial message. 




 When I'm driving in front of you with my blinker on and you speed up to get in the turning lane at a red light. I was going to turn too asshat! Now I have to either get in the lane behind you and halfway stick out into the other lane or go straight through and turn around at the next opportunity. Fuck everyone who does this! The person driving in front of you has priority in this situation. You could wind up in my blind spot and then there is a wreck. Don't fucking do it! No no no no no. Fuck you! No. 




 My wife and I every time we go out. 




 I'm in the same boat. It sucks. 




 I fucking HATE that. I took it out on my way, it'll take you two seconds to replace it. FUCKING do it! 




 John Pinette's inner angry voice. "Get out of line!" 




 Omg hahaha! I have the same inner monologue. Did you get yours from monologue-Mart or is yours pre installed? I left the stock inner monologue installed.

Seriously though. I hate people like that. Don't go to Google.com the search bar does exactly that. It searches Google. Skip the middle man. 




 If anything I'm working on, cooking, using, etc drops. I can't stand to drop something. Even if it won't break or get ruined from dropping it. So much rage. 




 Yeah. Lincoln was still president then. 




 Internet exploder* 




 Leaving big tips at restaurants and other tipped wage earning places such as hotels. I usually tip no less than 50% or $30 whichever is greater. Makes me happy. 




 I used to pull the ink vessel from the makers and squeeze the colors into the glue. Stir with a tooth pick in random directions. Swirly. 




 Head phones? The way they're worn around here, I thought they were neck wear... Hmm. 




 I can't find the link and I used to have it on my phone. It's a black and white gif of a pug and this guy peaks around the wall and I think he says something to the dog and then leaves the scene. The dog then proceeds to freak out and cusses dude out.
Edit: found the gif on my phone. It's not black and white. I don't know how to post as comment. 




 Just the other day, I was driving with some asshat behind me. The asshat was so close behind me, I think she was partially in my exhaust pipe.
I was gonna make a left turn onto the street my apartment was on. I got in the turn lane to turn. She then proceeds to do the same thing but she got in front of me. I thought she was gonna continue to the nearby light. No. She was turning onto the same street as I was.
I thought that she might be in a hurry, so I tried not to let it bother me. When she pulled into the parking lot of the apartments (she lives in the same community as I), I waited. She sat in her car for ten minutes. She wasn't in a hurry, she was just being an asshat. As soon as she was inside her apartment, I put a bunch of bologna and I poured my entire gallon of water on her car (it's cold enough out to freeze her car shut). When I went outside earlier, she was using an ice scraper to remove it all. Little round patches of missing paint and a very pissed off asshat.
Don't fucking cut me off.
It's probably the worst I've done to someone. 




 Where was this at? I ask because some time ago, this guy in front of me almost completely stopped and so did I. The guy behind me didn't and ran off the road. His car flipped and caught fire.  
























 Shit. I thought I posted ymm.2004 Chrysler Sebring 




 Yeah. That is a hard thing to deal with. 




 Just give it a try. It's easy....well once you get past cursing at an inanimate object. 




 Or Blu-ray player that is Wi-Fi enabled 




 Could you name some of those fields of work? This is a new topic for me. 




 Thanks for the reply. My brother Paul loves corn (or he at least loves saying it.) So yeah...I assumed you were him for obvious reasons. 




 I agree with the tipping thing. If you live in USA and you don't receive absolute terrible service, tip something. Even bad (not absolute terrible) service deserves 7%. If you don't tip because you can't afford it, then you can't afford to go out.
The other things in your comment are things I do not care to have an opinion on. 




 I wrote a comment about this once before. I don't feel like retrieving it so either you can accept that or go look at my comments. 




 I love to work. I'd work 24 hours a day if it were humanly possible. I believe everyone should work (getting paid obviously) every spare minute. I had 2 full time jobs (40 hours a week each) and I wasn't getting enough work. People laugh at me and think it's weird but I can't help it. 




 Paul? 




 Sleepless in Mississippi 




 This one is less a "life hack" and more just using available technology to my advantage. I use my Samsung Wi-Fi connected smart tv to stream my digital media from my pc. No need to burn dvds or connect extra devices via USB (phone, USB drive, portable hdd, or other such devices.) I just obtain media and enjoy. ;-) 




 Do the same with Pringles. Same concept. 




 Damn. Of course. I really need to get on that going back into the Army thing I've been meaning to do. They'll pay for my education. 




 I did that on an application for a job yesterday. While being interviewed. Yes, I was being interviewed *before* I completed my application. I'm that good
http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Luvmv-Bpryw 




 Those were my only purpose for going to kfc 




 Personally, I found their imitation of the big Mac to be better. Quite an improvement. 




 Rice krispies treats cereal is still here. MS, U.S. 




 That almost reminds me of those elf cookies that are elf shaped with fudge in the middle. I sadly can eat the whole container in  an hour 




 I can't seem to get my wife to understand this. 




 I agree with you on that. That's fact for a lot of things. If you pay $5 for x item and replace it 3 times a year. You just spent $15 plus tax and the gas to make multiple trips to the store or shipping fees on the internet on the "cheaper" product. If you go ahead and buy the $20 version of the same product, you'll save more on the long run. I spend more on my tv, computer, hdmi cables, car parts, etc because they'll last significantly longer and usually have protection plans. 




 That ridiculous neck wear? Or so I believe that's what it is from the way it's worn out here. 




 How and where? Where do I sign up? 




 I agree. This link explains a lot. http://blogs.howstuffworks.com/2011/04/07/what-does-a-gigabyte-of-internet-service-really-cost-a-look-at-the-worst-case-scenario/ 




 Arrr motherfuckin rrrrr 




 I think that may be my problem... 




 Ummm.... it's impossible to lie on the internet duh. Which brings me to the topic of my million dollar super computer that I solely use for offline checkers. 




 I stopped the DVD when he was killed. I refuse to watch any further. My wife still watches. 




 1. If you truly want something you'll work hard for it. If you don't feel like working for it, you don't want/need it.
2. Take pride in what you do, regardless of what that may be. Even if it seems "menial". Have a great deal of self respect when doing it. The only person's opinion (that matters) about you doing a "menial" job, is yours.
3. When you're young and see adults being successful, don't expect to just become a successful adult. Don't get discouraged just because you aren't filling those shoes. That/those adult(s) didn't start that way. Hard work was a big part of it. Quitting because you didn't get there quick enough is pathetic. 




 6'3, blonde hair, blue eyes, deep voice, and just overall attractive. Also, my Irish alcohol tolerance. 




 I can grow a grand, thick, full beard. My problem is it feels like copper wire. I have this theory that if I were to pull enough hairs out I could wire my car with high powered speakers. 




 So that explains it... 




 Same here. Is pretty convenient when some asshole decides to hit and run. 




 Twice this morning, and I haven't even had my coffee yet. 




 Mine is like that but more like 7.5 to 8 inches when fully erect. 




 This is quite the usual occurrence for me. Everyone thinks it's magic. I just tell them it's simple really. When they ask for further details, I give them the details and they roll their eyes and decide they didn't want to know. I might just adopt the "it's magic" line. 




 I was driving my car as usual this morning without any issues. I went around town and didn't have any problems. I came back to my apartment and drove to the apartment's dumpsters to clean my car out. When I went to leave the dumpsters and get back on the road, I started to back out and my car suddenly stopped like something was behind the tires. I got out of my car and checked thoroughly behind each tire. Nothing was in my way do I tried again. No luck. I drove forward at an angle and tried again. Still nothing. I kept changing angles and still nothing. I finally got away from the dumpster and parked by my apartment. I've been trying to figure out what's wrong but I'm getting no where. It also stops suddenly if I put it in neutral. In neutral, my car should start to go in reverse due to the slope in the parking spaces here. If anyone could give feedback I'd really appreciate it.

The engine is 2.4L 4cyl DOHC 16V SMPI
Transmission: 4  speed automatic.

 Let me get a job appy. 




 Or
Marijuana: *cough* *choke* (in a restrained voice) "That's good grass" 




 Marijuana: ... pass it on. 




 Justin? 




 As my previous comment. I feel your pain. I'm also a guy in this situation. 




 This doesn't work with my wife. For as long as I've known her she always has been quiet when I legitimately ask her what's wrong. I've never told her shit like "you're being too emotional" etc.
Edit: Also, she is the one that makes me feel like my concerns aren't rational or logical. Like how I feel about something isn't significant enough. 




 I'm experiencing the same thing but with my wife next to me. 




 There are a lot of repeat comments here. I would bring a handful of coins dated post 1994. Before anyone mentions fake coins. There are people whose job it is to verify coins and there legitimacy of said coins. 




 I love Forrest Gump and the shawshank redemption. I've never seen pulp fiction. Though if I were to watch a third movie from that year, I'd go for the lion king. 




 Middle school for me was the same 6th 7th and 8th. That wouldn't have been such a bad paper to write. 




 Okay. Fair enough. Everyone is entitled to an opinion. I just know this sub is the only one that seemed appropriate enough. 




 Why such harsh words? 




 I usually can edit my posts but... reference the last bit of the topic. 4 am so on... Shoes are simple swap out for the desired pair and either hide old shoes under rack or in the box and pot the box under many boxes especially boxes of expensive shoes. These are purchased less often = more time to make the shoes "yours". Make them look used enough. Also, if your Wal-Mart employs careless people, bonus. Have two pairs of jeans, one wrapped inside the other. Change into one pair, wrap old jeans in the other new ones. Hide like with the shoes.
Put on a jacket/hoodie after removing the tags but do it around zero cameras. Walk around like it's yours.

This method is brought to you as the wardrobe method.


Again, reference the grammar section of the main topic post for this comment also. 




 A friend of mine does a lot of shoplifting and gaining things in a not so legal manner.

My friend, let's call him Bob.
Bob uses multiple methods to get things he wants and can't afford or doesn't wanna pay for. These things include Blu-ray players, pc software, portable hard drives, cell phone cases/other accessories, and other things such as these.

The shoplifting is done at Wal-Mart.
If it's small enough to fit in his pants pocket then obviously... if it's a little big for pants or coat pocket but still small enough, his wife puts it in her purse. Oh, did I mention he's married and he and his wife work together? Well let me mention it. Bob's married and he and his wife work together. If it's still too big for her purse then they use what they call the mark down method (mdm). The mdm is finalized at self checkout. By the way, Bob's wife's purse is actually a subtle looking diaper bag so plenty of space and lots of pockets. Anyway. The mdm as mentioned earlier has two ways of being done. Either they locate an item that is 1. Significantly cheaper than the targeted item. 2. Has a bar code sticker that can easily be peeled. If both requirements are met, they peel the bar code sticker off the cheaper item and cover the target's bar code sticker. They've used this first example of mdm for things like vacuums (Dyson) all the way to counter top appliances like blenders and crock pots.
Mdm#2: For large in size but slightly cheaper items they still can't afford/refuse to pay for. Usually food items/extra groceries. Bob and his wife locate and memorize a large enough produce item and memorize its plu code or the go to banana (4011). The rest of this method is self explanatory. (Self checkout with the volume muted).

You know the little plastic boxes that hold smaller easier but more costly products such as large capacity flash memory devices? The ones that usually hang from the wire rack and have the grey lid. You know, the clear hard plastic ones that usually contain video games or pc software or whatever! Well the alarm thing by the doors at the Wal-Mart here are crap. There are two sets of alarm things due to the entrance being so wide. Well if the product is carried just right in between both sets, it won't go off. Bob and his wife have gotten out with butt tons of merchandise this way. As long as it fits in her purse, out the door it goes.

If my grammar sucks, oh well. It's 4 am and I refuse to sleep because I haven't experienced sleep paralysis in a few days and just read a thread on /r/askreddit about it. 




 Higher education costs should be based on personal income. Just as federal student aid is income based. So should the cost of education. If I'm only financially eligible for x amount with a Fed grant, then I'm only capable of paying y amount. "Y" being a small percentage (if any) of what's left after federal aid. I should only be expected to pay what I can afford to pay.
