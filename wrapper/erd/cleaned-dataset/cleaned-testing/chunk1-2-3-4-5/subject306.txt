 During my broke days in college, I tried duplicating this, buying Eggo Waffles and KFC.  It satisfied the craving, but I doubt I'd ever do it again.  




 Damn I miss Josh Morgan 




 Depends on your tone and your approach.  I read your sentence in 2 voices.  Creepy gay stalker voice, and regular voice.  That being said, it's a compliment, but the creepy voice can easily jar anyone.   




 Came here to add the same thought.  Japanese love KFC, but they make it sound like it's the norm for Xmas.  A few weeks there was a similar website where they listed breakfast from all over the world.  They put tofu as a breakfast item for Japanese.  Not even clos 




 I can't say with confidence that Alex is good enough to take us all the way.  Same can be said that if we find ourselves in a shootout where we have to air it out, I'm not confident of resting the game on Alex's arm.  Of course the O-line needs to improve as well, but if there is a free agent QB that's available I'd like to see us pick him up.  The playbook is only 1/2 open, let's go full playbook and see what happens.   




 Congratulations, enjoy!   




 The power of Reddit, helping hemophiliacs one day at a time.  Update:  I since have spoken to our fellow bleeder, and am trying to get him hooked up with Baxter.  Baxter was actually in our office the other day and this story was brought to their attention.  They're trying to take action immediately.  Btw, were you at Chicago for the Annual Meeting back in Nov?   




 Grades might not be the best motivator for learning, but as a whole we've taken out the concept of competition + challenge.  Now this might be due to the fact I grew up in a Asian house hold where grades were the end all be all.  But I notice these days, we coddle our children too much where there are no losers.  Watch this piece on 60 min about "Millenials"  and you'll see the result happening.  (http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/08/60minutes/main3475200.shtml)

The motivation has to come from parents, but grades can be a motivational booster.  Who doesn't want to score the least amongst your friends in class?  It's competition, something we've abandoned and have now let kids feel entitled.

 Here's my St. Patty's Day tradition.  Pick up a 4 pack of Guinness.  Pour 2 cans, (1 is not enough) along with the other herbs, and such.  Add only a bit of water, you want the Guinness to reduce.  Simmer for 3-4 hours till tender.  

As for the cabbage part, I like doing with a modern twist.  Slice cabbage and saute in olive oil, S+P.  Meanwhile reduce some balsamic vinegar til reduces and becomes a syrup.  Drizzle balsamic over cabbage, drink the other 2 Guinness and begin bar hopping.

 And Seattle beat the Ravens also 




 You're question is 2 part.  #1, 49ers are contenders.  Week in and week out we play competitively, enough to make the game close.  

Which leads to #2.  Alex Smith IS not the 49ers.  He's not greatest, we put him in situations that'll help us win.  Call it what you want, he manages the games and he makes enough plays.  But our Defense is legit, enough to be considered a contender.  Our special teams is elite, and our Run Offense is one of the best.  All those make the 49ers contenders.  If you don't agree then you're watching another type of football.  

Stop trolling.

 McDonald's Worker holding a metal rod 




 I was at The Venitian in Las Vegas for a bachelor party.  A bunch of us were partying in the room with strippers, booze, drugs.  
The strippers weren't the hottest, and their attitude really sucked.  They were demanding $$$ for bullshit, for instance 50.00 per dance, 100.00 for their clothes off.  We got sick of them quick and kicked them out.  That pissed them off because a few minutes later, security knocked on the door.  They forced their way in, and raided the place.  5 ginourmous guards stormed in shouting at us demanding to show us where to drugs were.  Luckily we flushed the coke, but couldn't hide the weed.  
They found the OZ of weed, took all our pics with us holding our drivers license, and that's why I can never step foot in the Venitian again.

To this day, I still swear by it.  People have hooked me up, I've hooked them up.  This guy sounds like he's keeping tabs on everything.  If he's keeping tabs on silly things such as trees, imagine if you're in a situation where he's really got you.  No need for people such as him in your life.

 My thoughts are very raw on this matter.  Just a few weeks ago, the whole city commemorated 9/11, by remembering the brave fireman, cops, citizens etc.  There was a feeling of peace, respect, and more importantly UNITY.  The whole world watched as we mourned and came together as a city.   
Fast forward to Occupy Wall Street, and it's like we took a 180 degree turn.  Now don't get me wrong, I am in full support of the protests, and hope their voice is heard globally.  And yes, the COPS fucked up on this.     
Having lived in NYC for 2 years now, I've concluded NYPD is a bunch of assholes, and there is almost a sort of pedestal these guys expect to be on after 9/11.  Now after this last incident, they're rep is back to being shit, and there's a feeling of "Us vs Them"  
As a society, when 9/11 comes around again next year do we all have pity and bow our heads to pay respects to Cops?  This ass backwards behavior US has is least surprising IMO.  And once again the whole world watches as we collide and crash against each other, making us look juvenile and incapable of handling crisis.

 Not literally...

Usually my approach has been direct, sometimes too much. The way I see it, if the girl bites then game one. There are times it gives off the relationship vibe too early, which has come back to bite me in the ass. How do I change this up so I can still appear interested without giving away too much? The backstory to this was that I met a amazing girl that just got out of a relationship. I tried taking the slow route, but it ended up backfiring. And I knew she was into me.

She's turning 28 next month, I'm 33. I'm pretty blunt usually, sometimes too straight forward. It kinda got awkward with the last girl, but at least it cuts the BS. I also wear my emotions on my sleeve, good or bad.

The backstory to this was that I met a amazing girl that just got out of a relationship.  I tried taking the slow route, but it ended up backfiring.  And I knew she was into me.   




 **Backstory**I met a awesome girl recently at a friends house. The only kicker was that her and her bf just broke up recently. I was getting the vibe the whole time we hung out, so I thought. A few weeks ago I got enough brave juice in me to ask her out, she said yes and the following weekend we hung out the whole time.

Knowing she's still fresh out, I acted my best and did not push at all. Ironically, this back fired as she made the move on me. We hooked up, things were great. I thought it was a amazing weekend, shared stories, similar upbringings, partied, laughed..everything.

So then a few weeks pass by, we talk on the phone briefly, was kinda awkward but didnt' think much. Then 2 days ago she asked me out, only to bail on me later. Today I get email saying she only wants to be friends. So with the info at hand, was I the "getting over my ex" booty call?

The only thing I can think of is that I might've given off more a relationship vibe than anything else. I did make her a mix cd, and a short story I wrote. I figured it was a worthy gamble. Also all this happened in NYC, a city unlike any other, where dating can be absolutely amazing or fucked. Often times in 1 week!
TL;DR Met a amazing girl that just broke up with her bf, I hook up with her although I didn't make the first move. Developed feelings, now she wants to be friends.   



















 A few weeks ago I met someone amazing (the white rhino), you know the kind where you can't stop thinking of them, that rare beauty you run into once every few years.  
We've hung out a few times, nothing serious, but I've been getting the good vibe overall.  She even informed me things weren't going well with her bf, and sounded as though things were going to end. (I didnt even ask her) Last time she even said, "I probably won't be talking to him" 
So last nite I finally summoned up the courage to ask her out. Although it didn't come out the smoothest, I still put it out there.  She responded, "I'm still with him..trying to work things out."  I asked how that was going, and all she said was "it's going"...Of course I tried to play it cool, and told her to let me know if anything changes.  
My question fellow Redditors.  I can handle the rejection, but was I missing some huge sign that I wasn't aware of.  Was this a flat out no, or do I still have a shot in the long term?  

 




 The backstory:  I recently met someone pretty amazing, we've hung out a few times so far, and my gut is telling me she likes me.  We went out last night, got pretty buzzed, danced alot.  I went home and ended up drunk texting her.  Nothing insane was written, but I did say I want to hear her story over dinner sometime.  I woke up today realizing what I did, immediately regretting it.  Sorta chickened out I feel like.  I feel like I might've killed any momentum, and she hasn't texted back a reply.

 The backstory:  A good friend of mine passed away in Dec due to cardiac arrest, he had pulmonary hypertension.  (33 y.o)  Three years ago, he met the love of his life, until the dumb whore went to Costa Rica and cheated on him.  The bitch got pregnant as well.  When she came back, she moved out of his apt and out of his life.  Fast forward today:  My friend's facebook page is still up and running, (his parents decided to keep it) people like to leave messages, posts, pics etc.  

Out of nowhere, this girl comes out of the woodworks and starts posting.  Everyday it's something, "I miss your touch, smile..."  Yada yada yada...Attention starving whore

Bottom line it's pissing me off now.  Only a few of us knew she cheated on him, everyone else thinks she's some sweet gal.  Out of respect for his FB page, I'm not going to bust her out.  But I can send her a message.  I need input on this.  Call me out if I'm accused of being a troll.  

TL;DR:  A girl who cheated on my friend who passed away is leaving annoying Facebook posts on his page.  I can see thru her B.S.  What should I do?   




 Last nite I began to feel the onset of a cold.  Nothing serious.  Went out for drinks which consisted of Jameson shots, 2 Stellas, and Henneseey with Ginger Ale.  Fast forward today, I feel fine.  I've done this a few times and it works.  My theory is, either I piss out everything, or the internal body temperature kills whatever strain it was.

 I work in a typical office, cubicle style.  The last 2 days the girl next to me has been hackin 24-7, to the point where it's annoying to hear, and it's kinda nasty.  By no means am I a germaphobe, I'm just trying not to get sick.  Is it wrong to go up and ask/tell her to go home?  What's your stance on this?  BTW, the excuse of I don't want to use PTO/or Sick days is BS.

 If you choose not to attend the wedding, don't tell the fiance either.  My reasoning, is that you're choosing to cut him out of your life completely.  You're acknowledging that he is not your brother.  However by informing the fiance, you're now taking a step back into his life.  Furthermore you're potentially opening up old wounds.  

If you're going to tell the fiance, send a letter, no return address so they don't know who it's from.  At least this way you're not getting caught up in the BS 




 If you're looking for re sale value, I wouldn't go with the studio.  Most young professionals come to NY for X number of years, and by the time they're wanting to settle down a studio is not what they have in mind.  If you can, go with a 1BR.

 Exactly this.  I'd like to know the backstory to this.  Was there hardcore texts being passed back n forth?  Were they drunk as hell?  It was their first time hooking up, and they went dominant rough right from the start.  That's an open invitation right there.  I'm not saying what the guy did was right, but there's many variables that come into play here.   




 What kind of messages were said back and forth leading up to this?    Clearly this guy took it overboard and violated you, but if you showed signs of wanting to be dominated and taken, this goes both ways.  This was your first time hooking up, you're gonna be going 100 m.p.h with excitement and such.

You've got to pony up a little bit and think what drove this guy to lose it.  Was there booze involved, how many texts back and forth were there, nature of conversation, etc.  Cops are gonna be all over this asking you how you even allowed him to enter your house and hook up?  As much as you are the victim here, when the cops question you and the incident, you need to make sure everything adds up.  There is a huge grey area when it comes to this unfortunately.

 Japanese fella here.  Although the dad is clearly being abusive, it's sorta common for the men to just yell at their wives.  It's Old School mentality.  Is it right?  Absolutely not, but the mom doesn't have alot of options. It's not like here in the states where there's support groups, organizations etc.  Sadly, psycho social support in Japan is not on top of the list.  

And unless there is complete followthru, I actually disagree and she shouldn't inform the organization.  She's only staying for a year or two tops, it's a different dynamic she's witnessing than if she were there for 5 years.

 Chef friend of mind in CA recently got married.  During his break, the dishwashers asked him when he's gonna have kids.

 Not sure how much football you've watched or understand, but it takes all 11 players to do their job in order for the play to happen.  Not the 3 out of 11 being a meat shield.

 My first guess is this has to be a summer camp skit 




 I'm simply calling you out on your "I'm from Texas" statement.  Your references of beef, eggs, and music are all 1 dimensional.  If Texas was even remotely as diverse as SF, I wouldn't even trip.  
 
For example, what's Texas eggs? Drenched in oil, butter, add tons bacon, potatoes.  I don't have an issue if you don't like Japanese eggs, but again I wouldn't bet the house on anything culinary from Texas.  Who is your famous chef?  Tim Love, cmon now.    

Texas Music, first that comes to mind, twangy whack ass country music.  Again how many dimensons?  I can say legitimately that SF is diverse and we can back up our arguments across the board from music to food.  And yes I'm also Japanese so I do know the culture and the gentle complex flavors that are associated with our food.  

Finally fuck the Cowboys!

 What's remarkable about him, is how passionate he takes his job.  Not saying that making sushi is mundane, but after doing it for over 50 years, he still takes his trade so seriously.

 Return fire has no bearing on this matter.  He pointed a fucking gun in one of the busiest streets in the world.  Shit is gonna go down.  

As for the bystanders, how fast can you process and react to what was happening around you?  Unless you grew up in a war torn country I.e Iraq, no way you would ever imagine a gun fight during morning commute.  Youre gonna run frantically, every which way possible.  Even towards the chaos.  




 Here come the Monday morning quarterback comments.  Look, you can sit here and analyze the video and say "the academy teaches you this and that," but at the end the officer put himself in the line of fire.  
Im not siding with the cops, but it's real easy from our vantage point to criticize the way it was handled, incompetent or not.  Most cops never have use their firearm in their lifetime, esp nypd.

 Should be fine, you're using some strong spices that beer won't alter the flavor.  Maybe add a touch of beef stock or water, but I wouldn't stress on it.  Post pics and let us know how it turned out.   




 You're claiming it's a myth, I'm arguing there is actual fact.  Grades might not be distinguished the same as beef (prime, choice, etc) but fresh fish that I was eating daily in Japan+NYC was "sashimi grade" compared to the places you've worked i.e (farm rasied)  Dunno where you live, but in NYC where I work and live, sashimi is flown in from Japan+Australia daily.  

I agree places like Whole Foods will get away with their "sashimi" but scientific fact, when the brain of the fish is pierced and lactic acid is minimal, you're getting the best of the best.  I know that's what I'm getting.

 Mexican officer, late 30's.  His partner was young 20 yr fresh out of the academy. Dude was so stoked to bust me.  I'm asian, in my 30's but young looking.  He didn't seem upset really, and I did not sound off at him.  It was a busy Friday night, streets were packed and people walking around.  Maybe it was the energy.  I do remember the commanding officer showed up in a unmarked car.  He asked the arresting officer, "do want to go ahead and process?"  Almost had my hopes up for second.  




 No fines.  Technically my case is sealed shut, but can re open if I do something stupid again.  As much as NYC is strict and cops are asses,it is one of the few states that is liberal for 1st time offenders of weed.  The ACD law has been around since the 70's.  I haven't done a background search on myself yet, but from what I've read the ACD is sealed from any outside sources.   




 Busted last summer on the corner of Bleeker and Bowery.  3 of us were passing a joint around on the street, cop car pulled up and arrested us on the spot.  

The time frame last about 3 1/2 hours from beginning to end.  After getting printed, processed, and what seemed like an eternity, we were let go.  My court date was 2 months later.  That lasted 15 min tops, judge gave me a A.C.D (Adjournment for Court Dismissal). End of story.

 Even if you're loaded on Vicodin, no way in hell you go on a killing rampage.  If you're on Oxy then you're even less inclined bc you'll be so subdued.  He might have been on anti-depressants, or some psycho tropic drug, but not pain meds.   




 They sweated him because he checked "yes" on whether he was arrested or not.  Plus he's famous.  Normal folks with a record can still get thru no problem.  When they scan your passport your personal history doesn't show up.  No such thing as private security companies, airports are government related in japan.  You are right about xenophobic 




 He only got caught bc he's famous, and he probably checked "yes" for have you ever been arrested.  I've got a record, and each time in customs I've gone thru no problem.  When your passport is scanned your criminal history doesn't show up unless for a serious offense i.e murder, drugs.  There's no way databases are linked globally at airports.

 You didn't answer the 2nd question.  If the higher ups failed to take any action, and Ramos was still out there doing his thing, what would you do?  How far do you go to see him get reprimanded?  Do you risk your own job?   

It's hypothetical, but let's be real.  There's a general code amongst the blue boys.  My point is, there's Ramos everywhere doing illegal shit 24-7.  How much of it is tolerated is a question unanswered, but from an outsider, I wonder who would stand up and intervene.   




 Curious question.  Let's say you knew this guy Ramos, and what he was doing.  Would you turn him in?  One step further, let's say you do report him and no action was taken.  What lengths would you take to see him reprimanded?

 I was fortunate to go to private school bc my parents (japanese) believed in good education.  About 90% of my classmates were white, (wealthy white) while the other 10% were asian+black.  I was able to attend bc of finanical aid.  At a early age I saw firsthand just how different a mindset these kids had vs the minorities.  It was self entitlement and this general attitude of being spoiled and saying/doing outrageous shit thinking it's completely acceptable. 


The one thing I still get annoyed with is when I deal with entitled rich white punks who think they run the shit.  It's a certain arrogance and mindset that exists.  Now that I'm living in NYC I see it 24-7 especially around midtown.  My friends and I like to call them Chad's + Brad's and or Wall St Douchebags.

 Good question.  When I have people over, I use a burner stove so that I can cook on the table, but you can also do it over stove top.  Not a rolling boil, but a good simmer.  The key is getting the beef cut super thin (paper thin 1/16").   You basically want to dip the meat and swirl in the water for a few seconds max.  Veggies will take longer.   




 Japanese style foundue minus the cheese.  Thin sliced meats and veggies get cooked quickly in a broth, and dip with sauces.   




 I used to work for a home health care agency, part of the job was to deliver meds to people with chronic illness.  One client was a 17 year old with severe arthritis which prompted him to be dependent on pain killers.  Month by month I noticed his orders of opiates began to increase not only in quantity but strength.  He began to lose weight fast, and his skin color was pale from being indoors.  It got so bad  there would be times I would go over to his house and while we were talking he would doze off in mid sentence.

One day during my delivery, I pulled him aside and told him my concern.  Of course this could have totally gotten me fired bc it really wasn't any of my business, but I felt the need to say something.  It was a short stern talk, and really didn't expect much from it.  

A year later, and I moved to NY and I get a friend request from him on Facebook.  My eyes began to water as I looked thru his pictures.  Not only did he move out of his home, he got a job working IT, became super fit and tanned.  He thanked me the talk because no one else (not even mom) gave a shit.   




 That's bc it's mostly korean exchange students around that area.  (language schools)  Next time when you're inside, take a look around and see the average age.  Personally I love woorijip bc of their selection.

 Yeah I've been on C.L the last few days, I feel like the window for stolen goods is prob 48 hours tops before it gets flipped.   




 I just wanted to see the process from beginning to end of what exactly takes place.  I'd rather hear a cop be straight up and tell me "look, there's not much we can do." Giving me #'s to call, waiting for detectives is just wasting time.   




 Backstory:  Last nite I left the front window open in my living room, woke up in the morning to find the screen window busted open and 2 of my wife's lap tops missing.  The laptops were sitting on the couch.  It was a pretty brave move on the burglars part, only because he would have had to actually open a gate, peak in from a ledge, and then break the screen.  Either way, it was a shitty feeling, and we should have known better.  


So we decide to call the cops, 4 huge dudes (more like gorillas) came in did some paper work, told us a detective would come by to do some prints.  They told us not to touch a thing because its all evidence, blah blah, and handed us a "incident information slip".  They gave us a # to call to report this matter in order to receive a complaint report #.  We've tried calling this number all day yesterday and today, no answer.   


I'm in no way expecting to find my laptop, I know its a lost cause.  But is this really the case where cops come in, give you a slip of paper and act like they're working only to have you run in circles?  Why couldn't they issue a Report # on the spot so a file could be started?  Anyone else have similar incidents?    




 As a native SF, we've been calling it the city for decades.  Even our hoops team has a [sweatshirt](http://kazowie.com/wespreston/B-Day+%6010/Golden+State+Warriors+The+City+Pullover+Hoodie)

 I'm surprised your black buddies spider senses didn't tingle up and tell you to not even step foot inside the bar.  I know my friends would immediately say something. Sorry this happened 




 It was our first date, we were dancing at a concert in Prospect Park.  All night long we just grooved out, and at the end of the night a club promoter handed a flyer and told us to come to his party because he liked our dancing.  

When I told him this was our first date, he said "you guys look like you've been together for awhile!"  I kinda already had the feeling she was "the one", but the club promoter sealed the deal.

 Here's the thing, the giants are the big picture when it comes to getting to the Super Bowl.  We saw what happened this year, Harbs saw, we all saw it.  We need to get it down the field against them, no check downs, none of that.   




 This is gold.  Thank you 




 Trade him to the Chiefs for Eric Berry.  They need a qb, and we could use a corner 




 Blinded by the light 




 Every Alex lover is so quick to bring up stats to defend him its comical.  The fninshed product that was displayed today wasn't just today.  It's been brewing since training camp.  Harbs and the staff have been knowing this.  If you can't notice the difference of today's offense and Alex, I dunno what to tell you.  

Urban Meyer made Tebow look dope in the same offense Alex was in..  Still in denial?   




 It's not based off data.  It's the flow of the game, the way the offense flows.  Of course because your so hung up on Alex, you're too blinded to see a difference.   




 I.E last year and this years giants game . 




 Yeah try telling your argument to harbaughs face and see what he says.  I know your mad, I would be too.  But these years sticking up for alexis is done.  Get with it. You think Harbs really meant it when he said smith was a pro bowl qb last year?  Fuck no.   




 Look we're all fans of the same team, but the Alexsexuals need to go.  The door is to the right, thanks for playing.

 Yes indeed, and any kind of mention of kaep gets down voted quick style.  
 




 Brady.   




 At the end of it all, what's your confidence level in Alex taking us to a Super Bowl?  I'm not saying kaep is it. In no way have I suggested that.  However given the small window we have, the room for errors is smaller than before 




 That's why we as fans let it be.  Plain and simple.  They see something we don't  




 In order to win history says you need a viable qb.  That's a fact.  Now whether or not Alex is that guy is not up To us.  But from what I've seen, kaep has done it more than Alex has in his given time. Whether he can do it for more than 2 years up is remained to be seem, but you can argue that there is a qb debate .  Like it or not  




 Name a Super Bowl winning qb other than Dilfer that has played it safe like Alex has.  There is none.  And the year after the Ravens won, they cut his ass.  Now, while i think Alex is better than Trent, why is there even mention of a qb controversey?  If Alex was doing what he's supposed to be doing, why is there talk of kaep? 




 At the end, the goal is to win a Superbowl.  And right now, what's standing between us and a Superbowl is a QB IMO.  My point of "pulling the trigger" means that we push the ball and make plays.  Not go for the safe read that Alex does over and over.  

I never mentioned once about entertainment in my post.  I'm saying Kaep is making plays, and is doing so in ways I haven't seen Alex do in the last 7 years.   




 I've been watching the games.  What I didn't emphasize in my post (which I should have) is that in 1 game, we saw Kaep pull the trigger more times than I've seen Alex.  

You provided proof in your post with plays he did, but in all honesty you're bringing up 2 plays from 2 different games.  .  I know it's only been 1 game with Kaep, but again he's not shy and he's pulling the trigger on plays.  The game you mentioned 80 yd bomb with Ted Ginn, Alex also missed a wide open Delanie Walker post 1st play of the game.  
And that's where I notice the contrast of QB's.  Alex is safe, cerebral, will not push it down field.  Kaep makes plays with his feet, often improvising which results in bigger plays.   




 Exactly this.  Not once have I ever seen Alex try and throw the 20 yard out pattern towards the sidelines.  Or go for the bomb.  If you watch the replay again, kaep does exactly that on the initial drive.  

Alex might have the "cerebral" aspect of the game, but kaep makes plays period.  Kaep has "it".  Alex, not as much  




 You got the cool ranch dorritos to top it off as well.   




 you made an asian sandwich, wouldn't call it banh mi  




 My gf wanted to go to his sushi/mex resto in Sacramento.  Reluctantly I agreed, easily the worst decision I ever made  




 I saw this post on Facebook earlier.  It said later nypd tried to wash away the body and evidence.   




 Getting married to my wife.  Shaking hands and meeting the Dalai Lama.   




 My friends were denied going into a club in Korea because of age.  Mind you, they're in their 30's.  And both were Korean

 Incorrect.  Sushi rice has vinegar, sugar.  Onigiri is plain steamed japanese rice which can have flavors such as furikake, salt, kombu etc, but never vinegar.  Onigiri is onigiri.   




 So you know, sushi rice and onigiri are 2 different types of rice.   




 Stephen A is fuckin annoying, and it's clear ESPN loves and encourages his antics.  But what's annoying is he never played the game, he's a analyst.  If he were an ex player, even at the college lever I'd give him some respect.

 Friend was the CEO 




 I'm always wondering how these NFL guys are wearing beats during pre game warmups.  Makes no sense whatsoever trying to run full speed with shitty headphones all.  

And they should know for the kind of money they're making, they could get amazing wireless ones.   




 A piece of advice a friend gave to me when I moved out here 3 years ago.  He said, "whatever effort you put into this city, whether it's meeting new people, going to events, etc..It comes back to you 10x"  

I took his advice to heart, and really pushed the boundaries.  To summarize, I met a amazing woman and got married last year.  As for my friend (the one with the advice), he came to NY with less than 1K in his bank account and minimal experience as a stylist.  He know styles hair for all the major fashion shoots, is known and respected internationally.  

Come out here and live the life you've wanted.  Go get it!   




 Glad to know the baby is doing better.  I know this might sound weird, but if Reddit is still around 20 years from now, I'd love to see the baby do AMA.  Your style of telling his story is quite interesting, and although it's sad, would love to know down the road how he turns out.   




 So often do you guys have sex in the kitchen?   




 and what? born n raised in cali as well.  you're talking a minute section of bushwick that has mexican immigrants, compared to cali where the influence is everywhere.   




 If it's martial arts poses, it goes like "Wah!!! Wata!!"   




 4-1 odds they still aren't legit like Cali.  NYC just can't do Mexi food for some reason or another 




 Because white people are the majority, they do what the fuck they please.  British and Aussie are still derivatives from the English language.  But the moment you take something foreign and "weird" sounding, and voila you get mocking/mimicking.  
For the record I'm asian, and have witnessed this shit everywhere.  People still do "ching chong", this and that, thinking it's funny.   




 They killed her because they wanted bike parts?   




 Bingo.  There's a bunch of east bay folks that are pro Niner/A's.   




 I find some of this hard to believe.  You really had no clue, no red flags, not even a inkling of a doubt before you got married?  As much as you're getting hurt here, you gotta look at yourself and ask how did you get  here?  Shit like this doesn't happen overnight.  What led to this, and why couldn't you see this happen earlier?  Man up, divorce and get to the root of you.  Both of you guys fucked up on this one. 




 I don't really follow college too much, but who are some good players coming out this that we can draft?  We need a DB/CB, and prob some DE's as well.   




 Lugers was good, but it wasn't mind blowing.  Keane's is pretty damn good   




 the one and only time ill fork over 30$ for a burger.  




 I sat next to someone the other day who ate that.  They said Minetta Tavern is hands down their favorite steak house, better than Peter Lugers, or Keanes.   




 Why is this in WTF?  has no bearing.   




 I'll be curious as to how far they went to duplicate this burger.  All the elements have to be in order, the right cheese, sauce, etc...Even Brit mayo is different than over here 




 This bitch had some annoying facial expressions 




 To further add on to this....There has to be a new generation of "Niner bandwagoners" out there that are clueless/classless.  I say this because growing up in the 80's and 90's, we were known as a 1st class organization with the best fans.  Fans would never accuse a player of giving away game plans.  

It's the same shit about the stabbings and fights going down in the parking lot these days.  To a certain point, we as fans represent the team.   




 It wasn't a overnight decision, but a gradual one.  It was almost as if each smoke was getting less and less enjoyable to the point where it wasn't feeling as good as it did before.  

That combined with getting a nasty nasty flu which made me quit cold turkey.  So in the end, it was a culmination of the above.  I wasn't one of those people who tried quitting on numerous occassions.  1x and thats it.  Probably because I knew how easy it would be to start again 




 The bun looks off, not in and outish 




 There will always be Alex haters, and games like the one on Sunday will just put him under the microscope more.  I will say this, he has all the necessary resources for him now which means he has to deliver.  If not, you can bet everyone will be calling for Kaep next year.   




 Try it with chocolate milk instead of Baileys next time.  Choc mint schnapps 




 Dallas is pretty shitty BBQ.  Take him to Dinosaur.   




 Our pass rush is nowhere near as lethal as last year.  One of the reasons we can let the secondary be loose was because we pressured the qb so much that he would make hasty decisions.   




 Well..did you or did you not buy the cuff links? 




 Ill grab the popcorn 




 Fuck that!  Any girl that tries to dis your moment with your mom is pretty inconsiderate and rude.  Tell her she needs to respect that shit, or get out.

 I'm glad you addressed this.  I'm seeing similar stuff happen on r/videos.  Esp the top video being reposted hours later. Sometimes even the next day.   




 Hey bitch, it's fags like you that are ruining Reddit.  People are onto your pathetic attempts.  Congratulations, you've discovered the internet.  Now go back to your mom's basement, piss the fuck off.   




 I was thinking pork shoulder as well, doing carnitas tacos.  Pretty filling, and tasty, plus it puts a theme on the diner.   




 My counterpoint.  Lived in the hood before, have hood friends, have done hood shit.  None of that shit scares me.  What does scare me is folks like you. Reasons why below

You're general stereotype reasoning of "pencil thin mustache, earrings, little thug lingo"  shows me just how fucking unintelligent and ignorant you are.  Which gives me enough reason to understand, that you don't know what it's like to be on other side. You'll never know.  Most of us on here are fortunate enough not to.  But it's views like yours that exist and to know you could be in a higher position than the kid in the video and therefore use your reasoning and judge the kid negatively

In your case, your broad based assumptions, along with your narrow sighted views are what enrage me, and will lead me to call you out on your BS.  The cops have no right treating anyone like that.  The kid should suffer and get harrassed because of another person with the same background committed a crime?  Your god damn right you go no problem with what the cops did, because you'll never fuckin get it.   




 This isn't 20 questions, and clearly you're new to Reddit.  You boldly make points in your post claiming the real victims are those who live in neighborhoods.  I can tell you straight up my friends that live in the hood, have pride. They don't consider themselves anything, nonetheless victims. You're making a assumption.  

This topic is all about the kid, and how he is perceived.  You said he walks and talks like a thug.  What's your basis?  This debate is about how you should explain yourself.  B/C if you truly think this kid is what a thug embodies both external and internal experience, you would be terrified thinking every single male youth in the inner city is a thug.  I disagree with every point you bring, not because of you.  Because there is no validity.  You're trying to sink this argument down to something else.  So, care to explain more?   




 I'm asking you to further explain yourself.  Simple as that.  Can you do that?   




 Whats your basis for what a thug walks and talks like?  boyz n the hood?  Walking around bushwick late at night observing hooligans?  Truly would like to know 




 Thanks!

 There's very few rookies that came into the NFL and make immediate impact.  On a team that's stacked like ours, why risk mistake/injury?  AJ and LMJ will get on the field sometime this season, but don't expect much.   




 No way we do, and I was a Alex hater up till last year.  I've already accepted the fact Alex is not gonna be the proto typical QB we've been accustomed to.  But Kaep is still a year away easy.  Alex has mastered this playbook already, knows the in's and out's.   




 The train ride over to the stadium was majority Niners.  I was actually a little nervous before kickoff that some guido Jets fan would try to start shit, but there was red jerseys everywhere.  In other words, backup.

 I also think having Ginn's absence makes a big difference in field position.  Especially those extra 5-10 yards on punts/kickoffs for starting field position

 Hey folks, was curious who all was planning on attending the meeting.  Possible Reddit/Hemophilia meetup?   




 I think most of us would love to see that happen, but WCO (west coast offense) is a combo of short timing patterns and power runs which ultimately open up the deep ball.  At the end of the day, I just don't think it's in Alex to chuck it up there.  I for one would love to see a jump ball to Randy Moss.

 [You can prepare chicken in such a way that will kill off disease while leaving the flesh cold and uncooked.  In Japan, this is called toriwasa.

 The [fun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sR0mrUU9bs) starts at the 2:24 mark.  Again, when your culture has been around for 2000+ years, basics such as produce and livestock are a completely different ball game than here in the US.  The knee jerk reactions are evident as to how naive you view world foods.   




 This is cultural, and perhaps even a difference in physiology.  Being Japanese, it's been in our society for hundreds of years.  Bodies respond differently.  I hear what you're saying, but I didn't even flinch for a second when this was offered.  Perhaps this [article](http://www.facingtherisingsun.com/japan-travel-tips-eating/raw-chicken-sashimi-torisashi-toriwasa) might shed light on this matter.   




 It's totally fresh unlike any kind of product here in the state's.   The chicken was raised local,  and killed that day.  Pretty common to find this stuff  









 Pretty neat to see identical runs against the Packers.  The kid is a straight up gamer, and he's ours!!

 Same thought process.  If Harbs was able get Alex to play above his potential, imagine what he can do with Kaep.

 If we could swing a trade with the chiefs for safety Eric Berry, it would be a win win for both 




 Plus his rotation is terrible.  He's been playing Steph, Klay and Jack all at the same time, a la Nellieball at the end of games.  Sometimes it pays off, but it's starting to become a predictable trend 




 If you have a asian grocery nearby, you can make this at home, its easy and more fun than going to a resto.   




 Are you a fan or a hater?   




 Exactly this.  We've forgiven Alex many times in the past for mistakes, yet the moment Colin makes one he gets crucified.  Let's see how the kid bounces back from this 




 yeah bc monday morning/arm chair qb's such as yourself are guru's when it comes to football.   




 Not only this, let's at least give Kaep a chance to see how he responds to  a loss.  We've given Alex many chances prior, it's only fair to give Colin this same standard.   




 The 2 coaches that I fear are Fisher and Coughlin.

 if you're trying to stir the pot, you succeeded.  i'm calling you out because you have no basis for your post.  can you back up your claim, or are you just giving a opinion?  

no one has to keep moss satisfied, and if you've been reading the papers, moss has been a true veteran.  he's even suggesting plays that aren't designed for him. we're all fans with amateur opinions, but don't bring a useless claim.  what you just stated isn't a legit concern.   




 Come on knock on our door 




 To the Chiefs for Eric Berry would be super nice 




 Not even close dude 




 and your also a fan with a amatuer opinion with no basis whatsoever

 Thanks, it was a year.  I appreciate the answer, if you have any other info please pass it on!

2 years ago in NYC, I was busted for smoking a joint on the street. The court decided to offer an A.C.D (Adjournment of contemplation dismissal) if I didnt get into trouble after a year. My case would then be sealed.

 wow you think of that all by yourself?   i see you always trolling the Kaep supporters, get off it.  We get your love for Alex and all, but you seem to talk this nonense bullshit.  

I said this another thread, whatever happens in the playoffs, whether we go all the way or lose 1st round, don't come around here saying "Told you Kaep sucks, or Alex wouldn't have lost"  bullshit

 The road to the Superbowl goes thru the Giants.  Alex played em 2x, and failed.  I'll give the benefit of the doubt from last years's depleted receiving core, but this year he has weapons.  

If Harb was able to get a player with a low ceiling and get him to max out, how far can he take a player with a much greater potential?  Our coaching staff was so clever and amazing with Alex, just imagine what they have in store for Kaep.  They've been game planning for Kaep, they will put him in situations to succeed.   




 Unknown entity?  Our coaching staff watches and scrutinizes these 2 players everyday for the past 2 years, they know the exact weakness and strengths of both.  Now while Kaep might not have the stats all Alex lovers love to spew, he's opening up the playbook Harbs designed to have.  

I got 5 on it saying we'll see a bomb to Moss in the next few weeks, and we'll see different plays we haven't seen all season because we've had to cater to Alex so much.   




 Whoever is under center from here on out, we support Harbs fully.  This past week there's been tons of shit talking between which QB is better.  I'm guilty of this as well.  

However if we lose in the playoffs, the last thing I want to see on this message board is another QB debate, or fans questioning Harbs choice.  We ride n die as a team, no throwing anyone under the bus.  It's not about, "Alex wouldn't have made that mistake, or Kaep was too young"  I'm done with this rant, let's go Niners.   




 He's a little bitch.  Man up and confront, no need to blast people on FB.   




 This dude is a little bitch.  Man up and confront them in person, he's got video.  It's like he wants the attention on FB 




 Mitsuwa hands down is the best in the greater NY area.   




 Oyster sauce is a must. Depending on the type of stir fry, fish sauce is also handy.  And don't be afraid of a tiny bit of sugar, these are all strong salty.   




 Sorry Kenka is junior varsity.  It's mainly izakaya, and those kind of spots don't focus on noodles.  Their draw is the greasy bar food I.e yakitori, pork belly, fried chicken  




 Not sure what ramen joint you had in Japan, but standard tonkotsu is white milky. My exp at Minca didn't have the look or taste of tonkotsu 




 The only drawback is the bar hopping scene on the east side is bleh.   




 couchsurfer, or find a sublet on craigslist 




 You're looking at a 1hr 30-2 hr wait for Ippudo, as well as forking over 17.00 for a bowl.  My wife and I are both fans of Hide-Chan's Hakata Tonkotsu.  It reminds us of ramen joints in Japn 




 Too thick of a broth IMO.  I haven't been to Jin, but have heard good things.  If you haven't had Hide-Chan yet, highly recommend.   




 Redditor for 10 months.  Explains alot.   




 It's not the end, it's a phase.  Explain that from here on out, the decisions she makes is on her.  You did your part, all you can hope for is that she is grateful and can return the favor one day 




 Exactly this, every Alex debate has to have #'s and %s.  Now while that might look sexy to Alexsexuals, we look way more dynamic with kaep.  Even VD raved about how much more zip the ball has when it comes out of kaeps hands.  

Ill give some benefit of the doubt to Alex last year bc of the depleted receiving core, but no excuse for this years giants game.  3 int's, and that's with suped up WR's.  I think our play book was at half max bc we had to cater to Alex.  People forget how dope our coaching staff is that put Alex in situations to succeed.  Guarantee Randy Moss is gonna have 70 yd bomb from Colin soon.   




 So all you guys think Harbs and the staff aren't competent enough to game plan against that?  Because essentially, when you're dissing kaep saying defenses will know how to game plan, we won't be able counter attack.  Please explain 




 And the same argument can be made for Brady, so don't categorize all the time  




 Don't even bother, the Alexsexuals love down voting any mention or praise of kaep.
