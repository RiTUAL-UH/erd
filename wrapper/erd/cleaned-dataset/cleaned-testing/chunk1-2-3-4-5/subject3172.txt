 Thank you for doing this AMA. You might like this little Christmas story.

About 10 years ago about this time of year, I was visiting my mother in New York City. In December, tree vendors drive to the city from New England and other places, each with a truck full of trees, and set up shop at curbsides all over the city, selling their trees till they run out. 

My mother has a small apartment and doesn't normally get a tree. One day I was walking past a tree seller and saw that he had taken some little branches about a foot or so long that had fallen from the larger trees, stuck each one into a piece of wood for a base, and put them next to a sign that said "Charlie Brown trees, $3." Naturally I couldn't resist, so I bought one and took it home, and my mother loved it. It stayed healthy-looking through the holidays. 

So thanks to you and your husband for this and other additions to our culture.

 a.k.a. canola oil. It's OK for massages. 




 The main difference is cost and the feeling you got a task-specific tool. Coconut oil is as good as anything with "massage" on the label. 




 Other good massage oils, besides coconut, are sweet almond oil and (my favorite) grapeseed oil. The expensive massage oils at the store are just something mundane like almond oil with some blend of scents; it's easy to duplicate at home for a fraction of the cost.

 The sideways emoticon is the best part. 
























 I read in a book once about an idea for a machine that could take your brain out of your body and fit both it and your body with transceivers so you'd keep functioning as your brain communicated with your body. 

So your body is outside the glass container holding your brain, and you think, "Here I am looking at my brain. Wow." Then you realize, "Wait, shouldn't I be thinking 'Here I am with my body looking at me'?"

I think the book was by Raymond Smullyan.

 I agree with the commenter above. Owning a plane means you don't spend hours in departure lounges every time you travel for business, or have to take an inefficient route through a commercial hub.

 The problem that this county wants to address isn't "some people are homeless," it's "some people are bad."

Many people in power view prison as a tool for moral transformation -- be righteous or be punished. This is part and parcel of that worldview.

 This particular plan may or may not work, but administrative bloat is one of academia's biggest problems, and it's rare to see it actually get addressed. 




 I lived a couple of blocks north of there for two years, and the distance was rarely a problem. Of course most of my classes were in the northwest corner of campus, so I didn't have far to go anyway.

If you can walk to 29th and Lamar, the 338 bus goes to the HEB at Hancock Center. (It may be shorter to walk to 24th and Lamar from where you'll be.) Also the 21 bus goes from the campus area to the Fiesta Mart at 38th and I-35, which is also a short walk under the highway from that same HEB. And Wheatsville Co-op is on Guad at 31st; it's a bit pricey on most items, but you can get some basics there without spending too much.

EDIT: Also, The 338, the 3, and the 22 (the same as the 21 only going the other way) also go to or near Central Market on North Lamar, which is basically an upscale HEB.

 Fred Phelps the head of the clan was a respected civil-rights lawyer before the nuttiness began.

 The bandwagon effect [is real](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6146/647.abstract). Saying you're not subject to it is the same as saying you're a freak of nature, like those people who claim that *they* can text and talk on the cellphone while driving and be perfectly safe. Nope.

 A little no-name sixplex near the north end of the Red River shuttle route. It's nothing special, and all the units are occupied ATM.

 You're gonna need roommates. I'm 2 miles from campus in a tiny $500 studio; even other places in my neighborhood are going for a lot more.

Your best bet may be to use one of the apartment locator places you see on the outskirts of campus; you tell them what you want to pay, they'll show you some in that range. That's how I found this one.

 In general, if the original increase was keeping pace with inflation, then it wasn't a *real* increase, only a *nominal* one -- it looked like it was going up, but it was only because the counting system in use was being degraded by inflation. It's confusing the measuring stick (dollars) with the thing it represents (purchasing power).

(This is not a comment on the policy in the OP, just on how these discussions often go in general.) 




 So it's a reduction relative to inflation, which does count.

 Pornography is objectifying -- we don't see the participants as fully realized people. If there's a story involving the participants, it's basically just a frame to get their bodies together. Erotica engages more of our brain, shows us the characters as people with a full set of desires.

It's not a clear dividing line; some porn does some humanizing, for instance. It's a spectrum.

 It depends. For instance, my hometown had its sewage treatment plant in the south part of town, and it stank to high heaven because nobody cared enough about odor abatement. When they switched to district representation, and the city commission had a rep from that part of town for the first time, it got cleaned up fairly quickly.

District representation makes some things better and some things worse. We'll have to see how the balance shakes out here.

 Hi folks. I'm a grad student working on a project that involves downloading posts and comments from a couple of Reddit subs, and I'm a complete noob at Python and so on. I'm trying to self-teach, but it's slow going, and I need a boost.

So if anyone in Austin can meet me and show me how to do the stuff I need to do (or explain that it can't be done, though I'm confident it can) in PRAW and how to manage the output so it's in a form I can use, I'd be happy to pay for a lesson or two.

(My project isn't "about" scraping Reddit data, my adviser doesn't care how I get the stuff off the site, so this isn't a "do my homework for me" request.)

Thanks! 




 You left out "There are those who will say that" before that quote; the author is arguing *against* the sentiment you attribute to her. 




 I made my GF watch this one, because she had lost my car.

Kind of a long story, but I went out of town for a couple of weeks, and her car needed repairs so she used mine while it was in the shop, and when her car was ready she drove my car downtown to pick it up, intending to come back on the bus later to get my car, only she just plumb forgot, and didn't remember till days later. By that time it had been towed from the 2-hour lot, of course. She was appropriately apologetic and paid the fines, so no harm done. 

In fact she enjoyed the movie, unexpectedly considering what a guy flick it is, and so did I. Though our fun was probably enhanced by the absurdity of the previous events. 




 I only went to that movie because they had a free showing as part of a radio promotion, but I liked it anyway. 




 The critics basically all have to see it, but the audiences are self-selected; they only go to a movie if they're confident it's their kind of thing. So more than half of moviegoers in general might think it's a bad movie, but they won't rate it online because they went to something else instead.

 You should read more closely. Leaving early would have cost *more*, presumably because of the penalty for changing the flight. In that situation, the way you cut your losses is you try to make something of it. Which he did. And things didn't improve. 




 "You just made my whole day." 




 You have no idea what attitude he went into SXSW with. It didn't help that the festival made it harder to preview the bands before showing up this year, but if he thought it was going to suck he'd have stayed home. He's that kind of guy. 




 He's written about the process in past years and has gotten a lot more out of it. 10 days working full time (because this is his job) should be plenty to find the interesting bands, and this year everyone was from LA instead all over. Now that the festival depends so heavily on corporate sponsors, they bring in more bands the corporations already like and fewer unknowns. It doesn't matter if ~2200 bands are in town if they're all the same thing. 




 I think it's important to have it during spring break, so the students who want to attend or volunteer can do so, and the ones who want to get out of town and avoid the madness can do that. But you're right that it's gotten too big and out of control (and money-hungry).

 You know what they say: If you run into an asshole, he's an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole. 




 Most of the bands here for the music portion only get to play one official set, but they're here to get noticed, so there's a secondary economy of bands playing gigs all over town at unofficial venues, including a lot that don't have live music otherwise. Just wander around central Austin and you'll hear a lot of them.

Several years ago I lived at the north end of West Campus and just walking up the street in the afternoon I could generally catch four or five bands. 




  My wife and I used to love going there and we always spent money. But the store started to change and going there stopped being fun.

Yeah, this. I moved nearby in 2007 and loved the place, but sometime around 2010 it was noticeably going downhill, and by the last time I was in there last year it was basically all Hello Kitty merchandise. It seemed like a bizarre trajectory. 




 I know all the letters, or at least 26 of them. Are there more? 




 The what now? 




 Toy Joy was already a shell of its former self before it moved. Last time I went in there it had basically turned into a Hello Kitty store; a lot of the cool stuff I went in there for was long gone. 

It may have been inevitable, I don't know what was going on behind the scenes, but it had gradually been losing its mojo for some time. 




 You missed the part that most of that 2.5 hours isn't part of the calculation. The report doesn't care if you're driving in from Georgetown or Amarillo, only the stretches where traffic is consistently slower than it should be -- the roads in Austin metro -- are part of the calculation.  




 Not quite. They only count the congested parts of roads. The congestion index only accounts for the parts of roads between Waco and Austin that are actually slowed down by traffic. In the NYC area (and other big metros) there are longer stretches of slowed-down roads. 

If you're happy with a short but slow commute, then you're happy because you live close to work, not because traffic is light. Because it isn't. 




 Um, because the library doesn't open until 7? 




 As I understand it, Austin wastes more time per mile of road. NYC's commutes cover longer distances. 




 The [methodology section](http://scorecard.inrix.com/scorecard/methodology.asp) says, if I'm reading it right, that they take the road lengths into account -- that is, NYC drivers sit in traffic longer, but that's partly because they drive farther on average. So, say, a theoretical 10-minute drive that takes 30 minutes is more congested than a 20-minute drive that takes 50 minutes, by that measure. Again, if I'm reading it right. 




 Politics, especially in Texas, is a full-contact sport. It ain't the garden club election. 




 That's not money from the university itself. It's money given by employees and their families out of their own pockets. When you donate to a candidate or a party organization you have to say where you work. 









 Such a little devil, that one. 




 Agree about Sprint. I love the unlimited-data plan, but lordy their coverage here sucks. 




 Suddenly everyone was dog tired. 




 Me: "Know what?"

Dad: "No, what?"

It seemed quite clever to my young self. 




 Interesting. There are lots of other factors too, such as that people will walk farther to get to faster transit, e.g. rail. 




 People generally will only walk 1/4 mile to get to a bus stop. Guad to Congress is about a quarter-mile. That means that if someone wants to get somewhere east of Congress, they may decide the added distance is not worth the effort. 

Having the buses on Congress puts them closer to things people actually take the bus to get to. This will speed up traffic going *through* downtown, but trips going *to* downtown are another matter. 




 Not really a neighborhood intersection; it's a five-way with a lot of traffic, and discouraging cyclists from blowing through there is probably a worthwhile exercise. 




 Little Deli is a wonderful place, glad to see it's getting its due.

 Go look up "honorific." 




 Winds tend to take buildings apart from the top down. 




 Only a few degrees allow one to practice medicine, meaning they can diagnose diseases and prescribe medication. M.D., D.O., dentists, podiatrists, and I think optometrists all qualify. A Ph.D. bestows the honorific "doctor," but you can't do medical things. Psychotherapy isn't medical practice, and many therapists have Ph.D.s. But most Ph.D.s don't care to be called "doctor" except in certain professional settings where the credential is socially valuable. 




 Your mom. 




 Orthography and etymology do matter in making distinctions; words that took different paths to the same pronunciation are not automatically the "same word," and definitely not if their spelling differs, as in this case. There's an argument that rake/rake are different words because of their histories as well as meanings, with ho/hoe the difference is much clearer. 




 No opinion on the stuff you've dug up 'cause I know nothing about architecture, but I was at UT for two years before someone pointed out that PCL is also (on purpose) roughly the shape of Texas. 




 Not a snob, but I like the beans at Wheatsville.  




 I read *Prisoner of Trebekistan* by Bob Harris, a 5-day winner, along with a lot of his blogging, and he's just fascinated with everything under the sun in a childlike, omigosh-look-at-this way that's both endearing and inspiring. Ken Jennings seems the same way to me. 




 Different spellings = no credit. IMHO anyway. 




 Reminds me of a too-high-atop-the-pizza-parlor story. This is secondhand, but I have no reason to doubt it. When I was an assistant manager at a Pizza Hut, back when they all had those peaked red roofs, the story went around of a manager of one of the busiest PHs in the city who had decided that the attic space under the roof was the perfect place to go smoke weed after he got off work. It was summer, so it was pretty hot up there, and he stripped to his underwear. 

Now, there's a reason they always told us never to store things in the attic space: The "floor" isn't designed to hold weight. The manager was walking around up there, when he suddenly crashed through the floor *into the dining area* which was full of people eating. He got up, ran out the door (still in his underwear), and was never heard from again. 




 Interesting, I take almost the opposite approach. I:

* don't use shampoo or soap above the neck, and my skin is nice and smooth and soft as a result.
* don't use shaving soap or cream. I don't even use water. I grab the razor as soon as I'm out of the shower and get to work. (This order is crucial; if I wait even 10 minutes, things get rough.) 
* only shave once; it's all that's needed.

It took a while before my skin got used to dry shaving, and in the meantime I experimented with oil instead of cream or soap; it worked fine, but it gunked up my razor. At some point I just wondered what would happen if I didn't use anything at all, so I tried it and liked it.

Possibly relevant: I use a double-edge safety razor, not one of those multiblade replaceable-head ones. It took a bit of getting used to, but now I wouldn't use anything else. One key is to be gentle and not use much pressure. 




 Shampoo and soap. I stopped using both above the neck a few years ago, and my skin and hair are both in great shape. I do shower every day, including rinsing my hair.

I'm way past my teen years, so I can't speak for the effects on acne. But I wish I'd known to try this back then. 

NOTE: You have to give it at least a week before things will normalize; for a few days your face and scalp will feel oily. It'll get better. 




 That may be, I only saw the thread last week; that person may have been referring to HM. Thanks for the info. 




 I live alone, and there's no way I would fall for this. Not after last year. I know what to expect now.

 Absolutely. 

A friend of mine once was job-hunting (she works in tech) and suggested to prospective employers that she work 4x10 instead of 5x8, if the job allowed it, and from their reactions she concluded that they were unofficially expecting her to work 5x10.

 My best friend is an ex-GF. So is my second-best friend, come to think of it. No residual romance in either case, but we care about each other and are in touch pretty much every day.

I have some opposite-sex friends I find attractive who are not romantically available because of distance or being married or whatnot, but the attraction just adds a little glow to our interactions. I don't feel as if I'm missing out, because I like just having these people in my life. 




 I was going to try to think of a good one, but I can't top this. 




 Respectfully but unambiguously.

You may want to ask the other person to work with you on making the relationship healthy again. If they won't do that, or if it's already been tried without success or is otherwise not an option, then do what you need to do.

 The idea implicit in the question "Why is there something instead of nothing?" that there *could* "be" "nothing." That if you took away everything that exists, including the interstellar space and so on, that there wouldn't even be an empty anything there, because there wouldn't be a "there" at all.

 A friend of mine was stuck in a closet for hours once; IIRC the closet doors were the louvered folding kind, and she let them close behind her, but they were flush with the bottom and top of the doorway, so she couldn't get a grip on them to open them again (they folded into the closet IIRC). She had to wait till her SO got home from work and wandered within earshot.

 That may be the "right" thing to do, but we should harbor no illusions that anyone at the church will be swayed. [WBC is a Primitive Baptist Calvinist church](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-kraus/westboro-baptist-church-rebecca-barrett-fox_b_4997296.html); its doctrine teaches that all people outside the church, and possibly some within it, are damned to eternal hellfire. Messages of kindness and love will sound to them like Charlie Brown's teacher -- Wa-wa-WA wa-wa wa-wa-WA.

I'm not saying we shouldn't take the high road; I'm saying that if we do, it's for our benefit and the benefit of others outside WBC. We just shouldn't fool ourselves about having an effect on the Phelpses themselves.

 I assumed he intended "this is more about what I as the guy like to see" in the context of "I like this because then I can tell my partner is enjoying what I'm doing, which means I'm doing it the way she likes it." At least that's what I'd have meant, because that's the whole point of the act for me.

 If you can't wait till morning, PCL this late probably has a couple of quiet empty corners, especially along the east wall; there's some secluded chairs back there. I saw a guy a few hours ago napping on some chairs he'd pushed together. Some of the group study rooms should be empty, too.

 Speaking of insecure passwords, here's a story I sent to [Computer Stupidities](http://www.rinkworks.com/stupid/) years ago. I'll just paste it here:

My workplace just switched to a Microsoft Exchange mail server. As part of the switch they went around to everyone's PC and installed MS Outlook and some other networking gizmos.

They gave everyone the same email password and put the word out that passwords wouldn't be changing for 45 days.

Everyone. Has. The. Same. Password. And everyone knows what it is.

They did this ON PURPOSE.

 "Be yourself" is incomplete and confusing advice. A good, full version would be "Be true to yourself," which is more liberating. So if you want to talk to someone, you'd like them to feel at ease so they will engage you, and to do that, you put on a pleasant expression, for instance. You may not feel particularly good in the moment, but you truly want to enjoy their company, and thus you want them to enjoy yours. If you overdo it to the point you're just putting on a false front, that's another thing. 

Same with saying pleasant things even if you're not feeling good or charitable; you want the other person to hear what you're saying, really hear it and understand it, so you do what you can to say it in a way they'll listen to. Your instinct may be to say, for instance, "That's fucking bullshit," but you also know that the other person will just get defensive and dismiss your opinion, and that's not what you want.^1 If you say "Are you sure? What about ..." or some such, then your message will get through. You're working harder but being truer to yourself.

 Not me, but at my last workplace I was told of a fellow who used a remote desktop from home to access porn through someone's computer at work. I have no idea why he went to all the trouble. But he forgot to close and delete everything when he was done, and the next day the coworker came in, turned on her computer, and screamed so loud they heard it two blocks away. The perp was fired as soon as they figured out it was him.

 The 2 is NOT a loser here. In fact, this particular suit is difficult to assess, because the number of spades you will lose depends on how the opponents' spades are distributed. If they each have 2, you can play the AK and collect them all and have no losers. If one opponent has Qxx, though, the Queen will take a trick, because after you win the AK the Queen will be the highest spade, and it will win one trick. (If the opponent who plays after the Jxxxx hand has QT98, then you have two losers. That's a distant possibility.)

Note that in each case, after you play the AK and, if necessary, play a third round to make them take their Queen, the rest of the spades are winners, not losers.

Remember that counting losers is only useful in a *suit* contract, because as soon as you're out of a suit, the next time the opponents play it you can win the trick by trumping. You can only do this if you have trump, though, so it's most useful to count losers in the hand with the longer trump holding.

So a loser is any card in a suit in the long-trump hand that you will have to lose before you can start trumping. So if your diamonds are Axx opposite Kxx, you know you can win the A and K, but you have to lose the third trick before you can trump their diamond plays, because you have to follow suit three times before you can use your trump.

So, sometimes (as with Axx opposite Kxx) you can count your losers in a suit right away, and sometimes (as with AKxxx opposite Jxxxx) you won't know for sure until you find out how the opps' cards are distributed. 




 I knew a pair of twins in high school, and there were subtle differences in how they dressed. I could always tell them apart if I saw them together, but if I saw just one I was never sure.

 Thanks for the correction; for some reason my hazy memory was that Leo was talking to Margaret. I fixed the comment above. 




 Just an off-the-wall idea, but what if you occasionally went out to eat with the *specific intent* that he would order something healthy from the menu? It sounds as if he's in a habit where waiter+menu = crap food. Once he's said "I'll have the salmon salad" in that situation a few times, and had a tasty meal as a result, maybe it'll be easier when he's at a working lunch? Just a wild thought. 




 The seeds for compulsive overeating are often sown in childhood even if the problem doesn't manifest till later. Most parents use unhealthy foods as rewards (be a good boy/girl and you'll get ice cream), so eating junk and the endorphins that follow become associated with happy feelings.  




 Indeed. I like to quote Leo McGarry from *The West Wing* describing his alcoholism, when someone asks why even one drink is too much. "I don't want a drink. I want ten drinks."

Edit: Detail corrected. 




 It's partly the specific foods and partly the context: Using food to get those feelings unrelated to nutrition. Somewhere I saw a study that said addiction doesn't happen unless you go through all of these stages: Use, stop using, feel withdrawal, use to ease withdrawal feelings. Soon you get used to using those endorphins to deal with other kinds of stress.

I sometimes go back to something a friend told me, about someone he know who worked in an auto body shop, where they use paints that do bad things to your brain when you inhale their vapor. He'd drink heavily after work every day, and if you asked about it he'd say, "After a day with those chemicals I'm fucked up. Drinking is a fucked-up I can deal with."

Same with overeating. I've sometimes counted myself lucky that at least I eat instead of drinking to deal with stress, but that's just less bad, not good. 




 The story goes that Oswald Jacoby could look at his hand, unsorted, then put it in his shirt pocket and draw out the cards one at a time at his turn to play, without peeking. 




 There had been suspicions about this pair, so one of their opponents was watching for unusual actions. He noticed that they were coughing in ways and at times that didn't seem natural, so he made notes when they coughed until the session was over. Then some smart people figured out what the code was. Look on bridgewinners.com for Eddie Wold's post about the matter, he was the one who caught them.

 I used to work for a newspaper in a metropolitan area. Once the top editor called all of us in the newsroom together to explain that times were tough and we wouldn't be getting raises on schedule, and we'd have to cut back on expenses. I stood up and asked why we had just flown five reporters and three photographers 850 miles away for a basketball game. I was pleasantly surprised how many of my fellow rank-and-filers came up later and thanked me for saying it. 




 I had to do this same thing once. Poor little snake. That was years ago, and I still tear up thinking about it. 




 Dress for the job you want ... 




 Thanks. It's a bit late for me (I'm almost a PhD in the social sciences now), but it sounds like good advice, and maybe some of the younger folks here will find it useful. Agreed about needing physical analogs for the math.  




 Reading books (including e-ink readers such as old-style Kindles) has a physically different effect on the brain from anything involving a computer or TV screen. It has to do with the areas of the brain that get stimulated by the light. 

If you're bound and determined to waste the same amount of time with hard-copy reading as you did with computer futzing, you could do it, but it won't come as naturally as chasing the electronic glow. 




 I read somewhere that White's slight advantage is just enough that with perfect play White should win. But as has been noted, the game has not been solved, so it's still speculation. 




 I've played bridge (the card game) for some time, and this is a factor when bad players play good players, *but* the good players still come out ahead overall, because the luck of the clueless comes into play less often than skill vs. skill. Put another way, a high-variance strategy (essentially, not knowing what to do) may work now and then, but not in the long run. 




 To expand on /u/ihadacatonce's answer, basically any game that includes randomness. Any card game, backgammon, etc. 

One top poker player has a complex approach based on game theory and high-level math, and he says that you could still beat him even if you don't outplay him. 




 This is basically why I didn't go into physics; I need to have some sort of physical analogy in my head for these things. (It might have helped if I'd had an explanation like yours way back in high school.) I was pretty good at the math, but the more abstract it all got, the less I wanted to continue.
