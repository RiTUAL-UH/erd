EDIT: Never mind I see it now....
 




 Well that escalated quickly. 




 I think this has more to do with your tastes maturing rather than just the fact of more exposure. If I hate something I hate it no matter how much I'm exposed to it; only if my tastes and attitudes change will my opinions change.  




 No. Just no.

 Pikachu main, here. I use the c-stick for quick down smashes (roll + down smash is king). Whenever I want to charge a smash I use direction + A.

I'd say it's more personal preference than anything, I know some great players who don't use the c-stick at all. I have found, though, that all the insane players I know ALL use the c-stick. So it would seem that it is your friends that are the noobs and you that are the pro. 

C-stick is also invaluable for directional air attacks. Pikachu's are amazing, so I use the c-stick A LOT for that.

 Why girls need to lie about this stuff is beyond me.

 You come across a child drowning in a river.
Would you rather save the child's life and have no one know what you did, or fail to save to save his/her life (even if you could) and be forever known as the hero who tried? 




 In Asian countries they have a plastic bin right next to the trash meant for liquids. Why they don't have that here is beyond me.

 Not on campus, but pretty sure I might have seen it off campus near Shadyside or up Craig Street. Lots of buildings that look similar close to CMU.  




 You are NOT overqualified for anything. Get your ass out there and work!

 haha sorry, I actually am almost out. I know quite a few people who have more than a hundred dollars left though :) 




 This design was submitted.
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/29374/Sample.png
Who could possibly say that the design that was chosen is better than this one? The quality of the submissions was not the problem here. 




 Not very good, the teacher is pretty bad and doesn't teach econ very well. Fortunately, I took AP Micro in high school, so I was able to do well. 
It's not a particularly hard class, so if you're able to get through her B.S. teaching you'll be able to get an A.  




 I can't believe CMU ended up with this design. With our amazing design and arts school, I never expected this would happen. 
The petition that was created the first day of voting did nothing, and the creator of the petition was told to take it down because it might offend the creators of the design. I highly doubt anything we do at this point would be able to change anything.  




 it's bytes, like I said CMU's internet is INSANE. 
and Donner looks super ugly from the outside but it's pretty nice inside.  




 I live in Donner, which is really nice, coed by wing (west and east), largest rooms for a double, walls are pretty thick here. Apparently Stever is considered one of the worst freshman dorms so if you liked it you should be fine anywhere. Morewood has the smallest rooms though, almost tiny compared to mine. 

The internet here is AMAZING, I get ~13 mbps download speed on WIFI which in my opinion is incredible. Yes, sometimes it cuts out randomly for like half a minute but it's infrequent enough that it's not a nuisance. Ethernet is the most stable, never ever had it cut out but I get slower download speeds ~10 mbps. You have a 50 Gb download limit for 5 days but you will never EVER go over it, I download large files constantly and have no problem (I once redownloaded my entire steam library and was fine). There are gaming clubs, not sure if for CS:GO but I'm sure you could form one easily.  




 Red 9. You won't be eating very much here, even though there's no buffets except Shatz they give you a lot of food. I'm a dude that normally eats a lot and these blocks fill me up to the point where I only need to eat two meals a day and a few snacks I can buy at entropy. Red 9 gives you $720 DineX which is more than you should ever need (most people don't use it all, and I actually have to make an effort to spend all of it by the semester).

 Yeah my garage has been duplicating my cars too... weird.  




 From what I've heard the Surface 2 is only a few hundredths of an inch thinner than the Surface RT, so thinness isn't really that big of a difference. Apparently the weight difference is quite nice, though I haven't had any problems with the weight of my RT. I got my 64 GB RT for $200 and I feel no incentive to upgrade to the 2 except for the better screen. I think $250-$200 is the perfect price point for the Surface RT 




 I have the AMD Radeon HD 6630M and I can run at at 40-50 fps. Just run it and play around with the settings a bit.  




 Surface RT runs on flash memory, not a hard drive, so the slowdown shouldn't be from there. Did you run Windows Update multiple times? The updates fix a lot of the lag/slowness issues.  




 Those floors are only accessible by CS students. If you have a friend in the CS department, just have them open the door for you. The elevators work the same way too. 

Or you could get lucky and "conveniently" walk in after someone opens the door.

* Max Payne Bundle
* F.E.A.R. 3

Willing to trade any or all my keys for any of these games 1:1. Or counteroffers I'm not particularly picky.  




 I have three copies of Killing Floor as Steam Gifts, includes the game and Defence Alliance 2. Looking for any offers.  




 Just give IE a try. I was skeptical at first too but it really is a great touch experience in tablet mode.  




 Realistically, what do you use NFC for? And why is it so important that if it doesn't have it it's a deal breaker?

Not bashing, just curious. I think NFC is a great tool but I haven't found any practical applications of it that would make it a deciding factor in purchasing a tablet or phone.  




 MathXL puts the CORRECT answer in the box after you get it wrong, so the answer in the blue box is NOT what you input. If you mouse over the box a window will pop up saying "Your answer: _______." I'm sorry but I'm 100% certain you input the y = which is technically an incorrect answer.  




 Well the y = is already given... so technically you DID input the wrong answer. 

I know, I hate MathXL as much as anyone else, but you just gotta learn how to deal with the annoyances.  




 Bought one of these and it did come in original packaging. It arrived packaged and presented as if I had bought it direct from Microsoft.

 Thank you! Did they really give you a dining table and a couch?? 




 Yup, I know that. I wouldn't expect them to give that to us. 




 What appliances are included in the Fairfax kitchens? Fullsize fridge, oven, stove, microwave, sink? There's no information on the housing page.

 Stark didn't say it was vibration proof, he said it *absorbed* all vibrations, meaning the shield can still vibrate but none of that energy is transferred to the wearer. Big difference.  




 I see. In which case decide whether a college degree is really worth it to you. If you foresee yourself getting a better job/being happier once you get a degree then go for it. I don't want you to be like "well what do I do now?" after you graduate.  




 You should go only because of the fact that it's a unique and rewarding experience. College is a unique experience because everyone there is living together and striving to achieve the same objective - the only other place like that is the military. The lessons, skills, and friends that you have there makes it well worth your time.  




 There was an incident that happened during Orientation Week at my school... it is now known as the "Brown Leg Incident."

During the first night of school a guy invited a girl to his room, and they began to get down and dirty. His roommate was trying to sleep on the top bunk and got so fed up that he left to sleep in the lounge. One of the RA's walked by and asked him what was going on, and together they went to investigate the room. 

While the two lovebirds were alone they had switched to anal sex, and were going at it full force when his roommate opened the door. The shock from the door opening and the ongoing sex caused her to unleash her bowels in full force all over the guy's leg, and due to crappy school food it was runny and full-on disgusting. We all ran out of our rooms from the sound and saw the couple covered in shit and fully embarrassed. 

Both students switched dorms after that.  




 On the thumbnail it looks like his nose is made of a dirt block.

 DOUBLE RAINBOW ALL THE WAAAAAAY 




 stoopid hooman...

 "Destitute Tier" haha 




 He doesn't really do a lot of fast action stuff except for the small amount of fighting at the end (that he doesn't do very well in). I'm sure you can get a clean, smooth picture but I'm most worried about the lag making it impossible to play shooters or faster paced games. Thanks anyways though.  




 My god look at that tiny HUD size. 




 How playable is it? Is there any lag/is it manageable?

 Oh my god, those visually similar images....

 How do you get Samurize to work? Are you still on XP? 




 You have to install all available updates first before it shows up in the store.  




 Just try not using your laptop for a while and see if you can live without it. Only you can tell whether it will be a viable replacement for you.  




 No. 




 I think it's time to look into the pros and cons of using each product in real life rather than just the pros and cons of the computers themselves. If you're gonna be bringing it to class, the Alienware is going to be WAY too huge. I'd go with the blade. In my experience with college, portability and battery life are just SO incredibly important. If you do get the Alienware I would look into also getting a companion tablet or light netbook for you to bring to class with the money you save. They're both great computers that serve slightly different purposes (powerful all around computer vs. desktop replacement). Make your call while considering your lifestyle (do you plan on sitting in your room or going to the library to do work, lan parties with friends, etc.) and how you plan on using your computer (take it to class or leave it in your room). 

Also, technically it's not their first PC, as they have the Razer Blade Pro that was released a few years ago.  




 Even a $30 is WAY too much to spend on a screen protector. Just get a $5 to $10 one if one at all. I don't have a screen protector on my RT and it's just fine. My type cover protects it while in my bag.    




 Future economist right here.   




 Could be a one? 




 Let's blatantly overgeneralize an entire subset of people, that'll go over well.  




 It's a sorority hand sign. Forget which one in particular. 




 The Blade Pro is an outdated system by now. The new Razer Blade is the one you want to get. Switchblade is an old gimmicky system that most games don't support and is a feature I'd pay to get RID of, not to have. There's a reason they haven't updated the Pro/added Switchblade to the new Razer Blade.  














 I also have a stand-alone mic, not in the Picture. One of those Yeti microphones.  




 I do have Razer Surround, it sounds great.  




 I have it dual-booted to Ubuntu, I just need Windows for gaming.  




 This keyboard is AMAZING, much better than any membrane or chiclet keyboard in my opinion. The only downside is it's VERY loud, really clacky especially if you type fast (of courss, this could be seen as an upside to most people). If you have roommates or if you think you'll be bothered by the sound I'd recommend asking for the Steath version which uses different switches to be quieter. Personally, it doesn't bother me or my roommate and I kinda like the sound it makes. 




 Not sure? It's just a background I found when browsing google images. Link the the wallpaper has been provided on this thread already.  




 Yes, I have a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50s. I am interested in getting a pair of actual gaming headphones, though. The Razer Kraken 7.1 looks really nice at a reasonable price.  




 It's a Cooler Master Notepal U2 Laptop Cooling Pad, found [here](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834997730).  




 Yes, I LOVE this keyboard, I had the 2012 model before and just recently upgraded to this one (2013) with the Cherry MX Blues. It is very noisy, and I do have one roommate. Fortunately, he doesn't seem to mind it unless he's trying to sleep and I'm still up typing something. I guess it just depends on who you have as a roommate.  




 I made the Rainmeter skin myself, I will be posting it on /r/Rainmeter soon. Look for it there! 




 I do use my laptop screen frequently, but I would be interested in getting a stand to slide my keyboard under when I'm not using it. Thanks for the idea! 




 It's a skin I made myself actually. I am thinking of posting it onto /r/Rainmeter soon. Look for it there! 




 I prefer it for sure. It kinda braces your hand and wrist and allows for finer mouse movements. 




 I'm not really sure? It's been a long time since I've had it installed, so I don't really remember.  




 I am studying hard; I go to one of the country's best Computer Science schools. This is just a small hobby of mine, I don't intend to build some insane computer-built-into-desk-with-liquid-cooling-and-leds system. Just some suggestions on computer placement or small changes or some stuff that I haven't thought about would be nice.  




 Yeah, I re-installed windows and didn't install the beats audio drivers after. Honestly, beats doesn't sound all that bad on my laptop; I even think it makes the sound from the built-in speakers sound better. You can disable the equalizer and tweak the bass and stuff so it doesn't sound bad. 

But yes I do have it completely uninstalled and it sounds pretty much the same.  




 It's windows 8 with the programs Rainmeter and Stardock Objectdock. Objectdock gives me that menu on the left and Rainmeter gives me the bar on top and right side and the date and time in the middle. 

I actually have my laptop dual-booted for Ubuntu, which I prefer over Windows 8 for web browsing and stuff like that. When I want to game I switch over to Windows.  




 It uses a lot less bandwidth than Skype does, so in that sense it's better. Whether you like the sound quality is up to personal preference; Razer Comms tries to make your voice stand out above in-game audio but it can make it sound a little harsh and unnatural in my opinion. Just try it out and see what you think! 




 [Here](http://wlppr.com/wallpapers/2010/06/14/Slides_of_light.2880x1800.jpg) you go! 




 I would totally get a different desk if I could, but as this one came with the dorm I would rather stick with it. Plus I wouldn't have a way of keeping the desk for next year. For now, this is what I have.  




 HP Envy 14 Beats Edition. Not exactly the best laptop, it's about 2 years old. Definitely getting a new one soon.  









 Is it just me or does this cat look a little like Wall-E? 




 I see what you did there.  




 This article talks about having the battery *constantly* at 100%. As long as you let the battery go through charge cycles decently regularly (let the battery discharge to maybe 20% at least once a month) you shouldn't have an issue with reduced battery life.  
























 The keyboard the keyboard the keyboard. The keyboard will be a HUGE step up from a simple microsoft membrane. Besides, you already have a headset you like, that upgrade won't be nearly as impressive as the jump to mechanical. 

As for your worries about mechanical keyboards:

* Don't worry about it disturbing you when you play. It won't, besides you use a headset so you'll barely be able to hear it. 
* Don't worry about you not liking it. Unless you are in a VERY small minority, you will absolutely love it and you will wonder how you ever typed without one. 

You can always return it if you REALLY don't like it. Go for the keyboard. You won't regret it.   




 Cash can be used anywhere that currency can purchase goods.  




 What case is that?

 How do these compare to the Invisible Shields? I got two anyways but I'd like to know.

 Try completely uninstalling Synapse and seeing if the keyboard functions as usual. If it doesn't, I think it would be time to send an email to Razer Support.

 Can you really play BF4 on the Edge? What graphics settings and what FPS do you get? 




 To get more rows of tiles on the start screen, go to settings  tiles  show more tiles and tick to yes. On my RT I get four rows instead of three.  




 I'd love a few to repair my old beat-up controllers :)

 And this is news because....? 




 EDIT: Holy shit, Gold! Thank you so much kind stranger! I figured that comment would get buried for sure! 




 I totally agree. Intel does offer more performance but bang-for-buck AMD is much better. As a college student on a budget that's what I went with. I have my 6300 OC'd to 4.7 GHz and it performs very well; at this point the only CPU I'd upgrade to is an i7-4770k, which would require a new mobo and quite a bit more money. I'm happy where I am right now.  




 It wouldn't be too much more expensive, and it would allow you to add more things in the future if you would like.  




 Better graphics card comes to mind first, then a power supply with more wattage. That's really about it. 

Keep in mind this is a MICRO build, more for portability than anything. If space isn't an issue, get a larger case and a better mobo.  




 You could go with an R9 280X for $100 more and have a PC that will last you for a long time.  




 I built a killer mid-range gaming pc (plays most games like BF4 maxed) for $800 or so just a few months ago so you should be fine with the cash you have set aside. I've posted pcpartpicker below. 

I got a lot of my parts with good deals which is why the total price is a little high.

 Thanks! 




 I mean sure, why not? It's just putting a custom case on a shelf above your desk.   




 Way to ruin it with the title.  




 Ah man, that sucks. Didn't know that was specific to the first generations.  




 Works for me on my RT + Touch Cover 1. You have to tap pretty fast and hold down the second tap.  




 Double-tap then drag. 




 I looked into it more and found that I do have DDR3 memory running at 1333 MHz. It seems that I was looking at the DRAM frequency.  




 I see, it seems I don't know enough about memory. Thank you for the clarification! 




 How much would you be willing to sell two of your 4GB PC3-10600s? 




 I would like to get at least 2 x 4 GB PC3 10600 or PC3 12800 (1333 or 1600 MHz) ram kits at around $30 or so. Anyone have old laptop memory meeting these requirements? Shoot me an offer!
 




 I think people SEVERELY underestimate the value of the touch covers. Here's why:

* Absolutely NO moving parts/greater durability. This is so much better for travel or general "beater" use as there are fewer things to break or get caught in. 

* Greater spill resistance. Spilling liquids on a Type Cover would require a lot more recovery than with a Touch Cover. Unless you've managed to soak it all the way through, a simple wipe-down with a paper towel is all you need to clean a simple Touch Cover spill. 

* Thinner. I know at this point we're talking millimeters of difference but the Touch Covers (especially Touch Cover 2) just feel so much lighter. 

Unless you do a LOT of typing (I'm talking multi-page essays or university assignments), the Touch Cover will be FAR more useful. A thin lightweight cover for your Surface that's good enough for banging out a few emails or urls when needed. 

To directly answer your concern, you can just tap the trackpad anywhere to register a left click and tap with two fingers to register a right click. No need to ever use those dinky buttons below the trackpad.  




 I have a stock cooler from an FX 6300 never installed. Name your price.  




 I love the Surface as much as anyone in the subreddit but I gotta say that ultrabook looks top notch... I would honestly go with that. The slightly better resolution and screen size does it for me. 

I have a Surface RT but I still prefer the traditional laptop/ultrabook build for a primary portable work computer. Sure I know it's basically the same thing with a type cover but the 10.6 inch screen is a *little* too small for heavy working for my taste.  




 Honestly this ultrabook would have pretty much the exact same portability of a surface.  




 Yes, but there are adapters that you can buy to get an ethernet port. 
 




 I upgraded from the Blackwidow Ultimate 2012 edition to the 2013 edition and that was very much worth it. If you have nothing else I say go for it! 




 Just take a look around, they don't really have THAT many products. Only then will you know if there's some really cool looking headset or mouse that other people don't recommend. 

Having said that, though, I recommend:

* Razer Black Widow Ultimate 2013 Edition Keyboard (BF4 edition if you really want it, but I like the clean Razer green)

* Razer Mamba Mouse. (this is the category where you should REALLY look around yourself, they have TONS of awesome mice.)

* Razer Kraken 7.1 Headset. 

Again, just take a look and see what really suits you.  




 Date and time skin at the center is [Metro Desk X](http://exsess.deviantart.com/art/Metro-Desk-X-v0-8-ALPHA-366743811). Top bar and side bar are custom skins created myself.  









 Try unplugging the keyboard, restarting your computer, and plugging your keyboard back in after your computer has completely booted up again.  




 I don't really see the difference between the two questions? Sure, the second one is more specific but a good reviewer will talk about how the workload impacts social life when asked just the first question (because it's the greatest factor in how social you are). Same for most questions on the page, they sound like generic questions any freshman or college review websites would ask. 




 For comparison here is the same model sold on [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/171011545519?ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT _trksid=p3984.m1423.l2649). This is a FANTASTIC monitor well worth the money. Good luck on the sale! 
























 I'm having problems running the hack... The game freezes right when I hit start after character select. I have tried running from an SD card and a USB drive. When using the USB drive the light on the drive blinks indicating it's in use but nothing happens even after 10 minutes. I have also tried recompiling the ISO. The ISO is loaded using Nintendont.

Any help? 




 No, this is a Let's Play! 




 Which monitor mount are you using? I would like to run a similar setup (one landscape one portrait).  




 His look of defeat afterward... so sad.  




 They've spawned in Zombies on creative mode in Minecraft before so maybe it wouldn't be. All up to Geoff though.

 I'd say social life is really depended on each individual. If you want to have fun and be around people, then you will find people that want the same. If you just like to work, then you can do that. 

The social scene is definitely here, and if you want to be a part of it then you can. You will do a fair share of work here but most people take it in stride and have great social lives in addition to the work they do. 

Hope that answered your question.

 Congratulations on getting in! Carnegie Mellon is a great school, and I'm sure you will have a great and fulfilling time here should you choose to come. 

To answer your questions:

The professors here are extremely receptive to undergraduate research. Really all you need to do is ask. I knew quite a few people my freshman year who did some really cool research projects, including building and programming a small boat that could guide itself across a pond and someone who was programming the software for a missile defense system. Really neat stuff, and all you need to do is ask. 

Professors in different departments tend not to share too many different classes, but as an ECE/CS student you will be taking classing in pretty much all of the colleges. 

You have the option of transferring from ECE to CS if you want to, and many people try to. However, you should keep in mind that the CS department is extremely selective and admittance rates, even from internal transfers, are extremely low. If you want to transfer to CS, I'd advise you talk to your adviser ASAP to get that process underway. 

The language program here is really great! I take Mandarin, and know many people taking Japanese. We have really great professors, small classes for a really personal experience (my Mandarin class has 7 people in it right now) and a great curriculum that really helps you learn the language. There are many options for study abroad over the summer and they offer many scholarships so you don't even have to pay. 

Again, congrats on getting accepted. If you have anymore questions feel free to reply or PM me.  




 For most people there is no shut down. Just the closing of the lid.

 It's actually 33.3%. 3 + (.333 x 3) = 4. 3 + (.25 x 3) = 3.75.

And the damage reduction is when it's NOT locked onto a pilot. So presumably lock amounts will stay the same. Who knows what the damage reduction is.  




 I'm looking for a 128 GB SSD for around $50-$60 or a reasonable price for a smaller SSD. Not really looking to spend any more than that, but if you have a 240 GB drive for $80 or so (I know, super unlikely, but hey might as well ask) I may consider it.

Let's see those offers! 




 Sent you the wrong one, sorry. Try the one I just sent! 




 PM sent. 




 Thanks so much! 




 Thanks! 




 I like your other game icons too! Can I get a link to some of them? 




 Thank god there's no "Over 75 Awards Won" icon on the cover. Damn that was annoying to look at.  




 Nope.  




 Got one of these [beepers](http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/b278/) and hid it in a friend's car. I actually forgot about it for a few months and remembered only when he came up to me and told me he had maintenance done on his car because he thought something was wrong with it. 

I then proceeded to take the beeper out of his car and hide it in other places for a week or two at a time: in his fridge, in his desk, in his backpack. He thought he was going crazy.

I started feeling really bad for him because it was really consuming his life, so I took it and didn't hide it anymore. 

But if he ever does anything to annoy me...

 I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1uts8o/19m_my_long_distance_girlfriend_19f_was_diagnosed/) a little while ago asking for help. I have some updates to that story and I would like to hear your opinions on what I should do. 

I waited a few weeks after my first post and I sent her a card that generally said I'm sorry for what I did, I will give you space if you want space, but I am here for you if you want me to be here. It was a very kind card (at least I think so): I didn't make any implications that she should reply or anything like that, it was very neutral and she could have done whatever she wanted with it. 

She then posts on her Tumblr a few things. First, she posts this: 


 "Im tired of this. I have already made it very clear how I feel. The rest I dont think I have any obligation to explain. I am done caring."


She then deletes it maybe an hour later (I was checking it pretty obsessively) and posts this:


"There is really nothing I have to say to you, because every time I do try to think of something to say, all that comes to me are words of anger. Thats not something Id like to do, unless maybe it is really necessary for you to understand. So now the only thing I have to say is that I think the best thing to do now is just to let go and move on. I have made my peace and I will let go of whatever anger there is remaining. I have no regrets, no blame, no guilt, and no will to even try to explain anymore. I would like to move on without even the tiniest things holding me back.
Though I guess I do have one more thing. Saturday did not hurt me as much as you might think it did. So let go of whatever guilt you say you have. There is no reason to hold onto it anymore.

I get pretty angry and start to vent things on my Tumblr, which I thought she didn't know about. I said some very mean, untrue things. I was just so angry and I was writing down whatever came to my mind. 

Turns out she DID know about my Tumblr and read everything. She sends me a very angry email saying things like "obviously I was too nice, and you're taking advantage of that, you don't say these things to people to make you feel better about yourself." She legitimately thought that I wrote it in the intent that I wanted her to read it. 

Her friends messages me too, doing general "you're spewing nonsense, you obviously don't know my friend, grow up and leave her alone you don't deserve her". 

I send her friend a message explaining that I didn't know she knew about my Tumblr and that I never intended for her to read what I wrote, and that I would leave them alone. She sends a message back thanking me and saying that what I've said means a lot (not sarcastically, I think she really meant it). 

Sorry for another wall of text. I don't really like leaving anything out. 

My question now is, do you think that I should wait this out and see what happens, or do you think the situation is wrecked and I should move on? She obviously did not want to repair this even before she read what I wrote, but I know that it hasn't even been that much time since our initial argument. I know everyone said to wait a few months, but I knew I would feel like shit until I did something proactive. 

Thanks so much for all your help. 
 




 A previous post here linked [this](http://livingmanicdepressive.com/2012/08/21/relationship-falling-apart/) article. 

What do you guys think of it? Does it have any merit? 

If any of you are wondering I'm already in the "past break-up" stage and she says that she doesn't want to be with someone who is acting so selfishly (when she came to me and asked me for some time to myself I was kind of pushy and tried to talk her out of it). It's a long story and if you really want to hear it I can tell you guys. 

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1w3fhj/my_depressed_man_broke_it_off_although_im_hurt_i/) is the original redit post.  




 Before I went to college I used to look down at my keyboard every few letters for whatever reason. Just typing a lot of essays helped me learn to touch type. It wasn't even a conscious decision to learn, it kind of just happened.

My advice is to just type a lot. If you really want to stop looking at your hands tape a piece of paper over the keyboard at the top and type with your hands under it so you can't see your hands or the keys. Alternatively, if you're truly desperate, get a keyboard with no legends. That will definitely make you learn.  




 I think they're planning one last 360 Let's Play when Minecraft gets on the Xbox One. I"m pretty sure that's what he's referencing.  




 Thanks a lot! 




 I see. Thanks so much man. I really appreciate your help.  




 Your armchair psychology is very good. Thanks so much for your help.
 




 Thanks man, your post helped a lot. This just happened to me yesterday, so yes it is very fresh. 

I am going to give her the time she needs. How long do you think I should wait? I know you said months, and I know you don't know very much about my situation, but just your opinion based on this situation would be great. 

And yes, I am prepared for that worse case scenario where she just deletes me. But right now I just want to help her in any way I can, human to human.  




 I do want to give her the space she needs and deserves, but is there anything I can do to let her know that I still care about her and that I'm still there? We left on really terrible terms and I want her to know I'm still there for her. 

I was thinking of sending her a post card every once in a while just saying hey I'm still here for you I hope you're feeling better. Nothing pushy, nothing that makes her make a decision, nothing that makes her respond. Does that sound like a good idea?  




 What I think I can do:

Obviously right now I've hurt her so much that any advance I make in the near future probably won't be received well. I think it's to the point where if she saw an email from me she would delete it right away or if she got a letter she would instantly throw it away. So attempting to contact her now is out of the question.
I feel like now I just need to remind her that I am still here. My mom thinks it's a good idea to send her something ever one in a while, like a small thing of chocolates or something like it, addressed from me so she knows that I sent it but with no other text. I think this is an okay idea. What do you think?

I still really want to apologize to her for what I did, but again, I don't think she's in the mindset to receive it. The second to last message she sent me was "This is so upsetting you need to stop this I don't want to hear it". Do you think it's a good idea for me to try to apologize, and how would I go about doing that?

 Thanks in advance for reading this and helping me out.

**BACKSTORY**

Im a sophomore in college and go to a university on the East Coast. Last summer when I was back for summer break I met what I think is the girl of my dreams. We both have our homes in the same city on the West Coast. If you asked me why I love her, I couldnt give you a definitive answer. But I know that I am the happiest when I am around her and I love her more than anyone I have ever known.

I met her only two weeks before I had to go back to college, so I tried to make the most of it. I was with her almost every day and I had the time of my life with her. When the two weeks were up I knew that I wanted to have a relationship with this girl and I wanted to ask her out in person and not wait, so I asked her out, and she said yes, and we both left on great terms.

Throughout the semester we keep in contact and talking almost every day, Skypeing and messaging each other and what not. It is during this time that I learned that she has pretty big family issues that were left unresolved when they happened (her parents got divorced and I dont think she ever learned to properly handle it, and she still has big issues with her father to this day). I was able to relate to her, since I too have had problems with my parents, and I put it in my mind that this is something to think about and maybe help her in the future.

Winter break comes and Im so excited to see her. Unfortunately, she had planned a trip to her home country Taiwan that would take up almost the entire break. So I see her twice before she left, two of the best nights of my life, and she left. We still kept in contact but it was difficult due to the time difference. We sent emails to each other every day but we talked about very serious topics. In her last email to me she made a comment saying that she thought it might not have been a good idea to enter into a relationship so quickly.

**THE MAIN PART**

She comes back from her trip and she tells me that she has time for one last visit with her. So I meet her and I can tell pretty much right away that something is wrong.

She tells me that late last semester she was diagnosed with depression and that her father is abusive (her words, not mine). And she tells me that she needs time to sort things out by herself. I ask her what she means by needing time and she says that she cant handle a relationship right now and that she doesnt want me to contact her or talk to her.

I preface this next part by saying at that point I had no clue about how to talk to someone or help someone with depression. I know now that what I did was completely and utterly wrong and hurt her more than I can imagine. But back to the story.

Naturally I do not like what she is telling me. I felt terrible that the person I loved was diagnosed with depression and felt so hurt by the fact that she didnt want to keep in contact with me and talk to me. Again, this is before I knew that people with depression push the people they love away. So I told her that I dont think I can do that, especially now that I know that youre sick, and that I want to be there for her and help her overcome her depression. And she kept saying no, that she needs time, which is something someone with depressions would do. I got so frustrated and angry that she didnt want me that I stormed out on her. I know. Bad call.

I sent her a text that night saying I was sorry for leaving the way I did and that I am there for her whenever she needs me. She sends a text back saying shes sorry too and that hopefully were both a lot happier when we see each other again.

The next day I wrote and sent her a physical letter saying basically that I dont expect a response, Im sorry for being an ass and that if you say you need time, you need time, Im scared that you will forget about me, I love you and I will miss you, please dont forget about me. I also said that I dont think you have to do it this way and that it hurts me that you are doing this to me. I know, I know, the absolute wrong thing to say.

Wednesday she gets my letter and immediately sends me an email. Here is the most relevant bit.


"When we talked, what I really needed was your support, your patience, your understanding, and your respect. And I feel that I didnt get any of that. I had hoped that you would understand, but now I feel like you havent even tried. I didnt do this to hurt you. In part I was trying to protect you, but I was also trying to protect myself, something I need to do. How could you think that this is something that Ive done to you? I dont blame you for anything. But I honestly cannot understand how selfish and immature you are acting. You say that you care, but right now you are hurting me rather than helping me. I cannot be with someone who acts this way. I see very clearly now that we cant be in a relationship. This is not how love works.

I have only one request. Please do not make this even more difficult for me. Please just leave me alone. Youll get better and youll move on and live your life. You will.

I wont forget the memories we made because they were good memories, but now its time to move on. I really do wish the best for you.


Naturally, I go ballistic. I called her, left her a pathetic voicemail, emailed her back three times, recorded a pathetic video and sent it to her, and messaged her on Facebook. In short, I didnt do what she wanted.

She unfriends me from Facebook and I ask to her to not unfriend me. Im trying to talk to her, saying things like Youre right. I dont understand, but I cant if you do this. Please help me understand, I want to be here for you. It gets so bad that she messages me, in all caps, JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

And so I stop. And thats the last interaction Ive had with her.

**WHAT I THINK NOW**

From what Ive read online, and looking back at what I did, I did the exact opposite of what she needed me to do. She needed me to understand, but I was too blinded by wanted to keep this relationship that I wouldnt listen to her until she had to scream it over Facebook. She did what people with depression do, and I didnt see that and tried to talk her out of it and blame her, which is the absolute opposite of what she needed. I know what I did hurt her so much.

At this point, Im not concerned with getting back together with her. At this point I just want her to be better. From what Ive heard her depression is severe to the point where it is hurting her physical well being in that she can barely make it through a day without almost collapsing. And friends that are complete strangers to her have seen her on campus have told me that she looks miserable and that theres something wrong, even though I hadnt told them anything about this. She doesnt have very many close friends, and she hasnt told her parents about her depression because partly, theyre the cause. Im pretty sure I am one of the very few (or maybe the ONLY) person she has trusted this information with.

I know she cares about me or she wouldnt be acting this way. But Im not concerned with that right now. All I want is to be a good person and help her in any way I can. I still care so much about her, but my goal is not to get her back. My only goal is to help her get better. My question is how do I do that?

Thanks for reading my incredibly long post, and thanks for the help you give. I will be here on my computer all day so if you have any more questions just ask and I will respond quickly.

A note: she has said the she has been visiting a therapist, so she is getting help professionally. Im asking what I can do personally to help her.

**TL;DR** My girlfriend was diagnosed with depression that is severe to the point of it harming her physically. She told me she needed time to figure things out herself but I wouldnt let her do that and I pushed her so hard she broke up with me. She needed my support and I didnt give it to her. Right now, I am not interested in getting her back. Just as a friend, what do I do now to help her in any way?
