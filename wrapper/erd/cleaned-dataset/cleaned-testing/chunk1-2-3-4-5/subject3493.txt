 Idk about you, but I go hard or go home. I staying up for 72 hours 




 You do realize that 15gb worth of updates, was added AFTER the disc was released. Likely built up over time, Devs aren't gonna release an updated disc every update. 




 I'm a good person, in fallout 3 I didn't blow up megaton and I disabled the bomb. 




 Sounds like content that SHOULD be in the game rather then as DLC. nb4hate 




 I typing on the ps4.Im on ps4, live North american,on est.Game all day. Got a lvl 21 hunter, and a lvl 1 warlock. Im currently doing strikes and PvP,hope to start doing raids sometime in the future.I do have mic and hope all who add me do too. My psn is test_subject3493 and if im not on destiny i will be soon 
























 Anything like fallout shelter to play till it comes to Android? 




 I mean ps4 has a touch pad, with possibly an unlimited possibility of buttons and functions.... Push to talk doesn't seem like that hard of thing to accomplish for the ps4, dunno about xbone. How about double tap and hold down on dpad . that could work on console 




 HORRY SHEEET , IM IN 




 It let me on earlier weird 




 But the game does work? Eu servers running smooth as butter for a lot of people. 
























 You are dead 




 The items beta test are pose to be getting in the live version of the game for beta testing? 




 Closed beta Client 2, do I need to redownload the entire client when it is launched or will it update? 




 ESO is almost 60gb. Do some research. 




 Let's talk about these armored bear mounts. Will we be able to ride em, or are they npc only? 
























 I laughed more then I should have 




 Just imagine dishonored 2 




 Ahhh good game, good game. You're gonna love the ending 




 I kinda feel like they just took the last update they had at launch, and just fixed stuff list, and sent it out. The patch notes don't seem 15gb worthy , but what do I know? I'm just your run of the mill gamer 




 And commas I believe 
























 Edited, PS4. Sorry my bad lol 




 More like a downgrade then an upgrade 




 Looking for a new guild? Freshly made, Vindictive Vengeance awaits you. We currently reside on the NA servers on ps4 and side with the Aldmeri Dominion. We are a social/pvp guild .currently its just me, but with luck more will come. If youre interested in joining a new guild just out of the guild maker 2000 , then shoot me a message with your psn and you'll get an invite as soon as I get on. 




 Where there is supply there is likely always demand,  unless something better comes along and replaces that supply On a side note is 10k that hard to get? I made about 30-40k from 1-27. And I'm not even at the recommended level for the area where vamps and wolves spawn. Play the game, enjoy the content. Rather then complaining about something so minor. It's a skill tree and a quest. Nothing more, nothing less. I say 10k cause that was the average price on pc, money isn't hard to get, its just time consuming .
EDIT: just realized my first statement doesn't really make a lot of sense, ignore it I suppose
