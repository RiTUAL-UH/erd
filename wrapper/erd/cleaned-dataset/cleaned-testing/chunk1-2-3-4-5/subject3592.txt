 I get 6.98 MBPS here in Talbot :( 




 The union one has this system where if you work for an hour for them, they'll give you $10 worth of posters. And the work is simple -- hand out fliers or put posters back into their covers etc.  




 Yeah that's what I'm saying. Sometimes things will be fucked up. But that's not a reason to not try. 




 I just made the move, and things got fucked up royally...But while I'm hoping that things get better, I still don't regret doing it... 




 Sounds awesome...But $20 :(

Oh the concerts I'm not going to because of my "Penny wise Pound foolish" policy... 




 I just heard from someone, that it's better to be an asshole with integrity than a nice coward. That's of course, assuming the situation has given you only those choices. 

Otherwise, I completely agree with what you say. 




 Came here to say this -- Chinese Eggplant with Basil Sauce! 




 Maybe I missed something, but how did he know the "teenager" was texting? 




 I think BBC America releases it online the same day as the broadcast now. Not sure because I will be watching it on the 27th anyway. 




 Thank you...that makes sense! 




 Thanks! 




 While I don't agree with you, the fact that the photo doesn't convince you otherwise made me look at the photo critically.

I wanted to convey a feeling of vagueness and uncertainty through the photo. I'm not sure at all if that's coming through.. 









 I came here to say Turkey Run too. I've been camping there too.

Forest Glen is also a good option. If you want to go a little farther (4 hours), Shawnee National Forest is amazing. 




 I'm sorry, but I cried a little there. I wish you the best and hope you make it through. 




 Song of ice and Fire, LOTR, The foundation Series, The Hitchhiker's Guide books, the Space Odyssey Series by Arthur C. Clarke, and anything by Ursula LeGuin

EDIT: Must include Dune in the above list! 




 Been 2 hours, no reply yet. And I'm stuck at work for 2 more hours, so still waiting.. 




 Yeah thanks! I'm the one who's out right now. So I guess, I go back and face the music.. 




 And now I will learn the same lesson, I guess :) 




 Ooh thank you for your logic, LogicalSpider :D It helps that even though I chose email out of cowardice, there might be a small silver lining to it! 




 Oh believe me I tried. And it seems I do have a lack of balls, otherwise why wouldn't I have said anything for a year :) But we'll have to talk about it now...so hopefully the rejection won't be too cruel! 




 Yeah thats the impression I'm getting .. Oh well, my first time! 




 Oh no...I'm hoping we can continue to be friends...or it can't work like that? :O Shit..maybe I should have asked here before the email 




 Oh no, it was a reasonably long email explaining why I took so long and it ended with me saying that we should talk about it ... 




 Well I did say we should talk about it...So I get consolation prize at least .. 




 Yeah true. I did the former...and now it seems like a bad idea! 




 Shit...yeah...but it's been a year...Oh well .. 




 Well it was awkward for me for a long time...so I guess now it will go both ways :) 




 Some showers are good, some not so much I guess... 




 Thanks! 




 Outside 




 You would think  


That if you sat in the bath tub  
Long enough  
With the shower on in full force  


Hot water  
Slowly turning cold  


Your feelings  
All those crazy thoughts  
Would run down  
Your body  


And drain themselves  
With the water  


You would think that  
Wouldnt you?  


But let me tell you  
What really happens  


The water comes  
Hits you  
And then it goes  

  
Well, its water,  
What did you expect?  


Your feelings  
They stay where they are  
After the water is cold  
And you turn off the shower  


Youre the same as before  
Slightly cleaner maybe  
But the same.


 




 You can't replace the beatles drummer. He knew exactly what he was doing, what the song needed and what sounded best:

Example 1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axb2sHpGwHQ
Example 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6tV11acSRk

If what you meant that any drummer can play the Beatles songs, then I agree with you. But the band drummer also comes up with the grooves and beats...I think Ringo was a perfect fit for them
 




 Very unusual and well written!  




 Tired, Burnt out  
Where do I go from here  


Hello rock  
Meet my bottom  
Ha ha ha  


Laugh  
Bass guitar plucks on my heart  
I laugh at the...  

The drums start  
Before I complete my thoughts  


Which are slower today  
Because you're in the other lane  
Coming towards me  
Your face going bigger  


I can see the shape of your breasts  
I don't want to look  
No I want to


Hello rock  
Meet my bottom  
Ha ha ha  
 




 Wow...wow..wow.

At first I thought -- Street drummer, is probably just going to play real fast and OP doesn't know anything. Well I'm off my horse! Real musical playing, awesome feel, lots of dynamics, brilliant rolls that aren't just straight Left Right Left Right, a right foot that has a mind of it's own .. a left foot that has brilliant sex the right hand ... 

He better be playing for a real band!! 




 That is way cool! 




 Yes..That was the intent. It was an unexpected moment and I found myself thinking about it days after it happened! 




 Thanks :) 




 
Smile
--------
Her hand was  
Covering her mouth  
As she turned up  
From her book  

And looked at me  
The edges of her lips  
Showed themselves  
From behind her knuckles  
And curled up  
Into a smile

I think the cafe was bright  
And one of the lights  
Was shining in her eyes  

The world stopped  
And then started again 




 Really nice! 




 My friends and I used to use such riddles to play a game. One guy would present a situation and everyone else would ask him question that he could answer only with "Yes", "No" or "Not relevant".

It sounds random, but we almost always got to the right answer within 30 questions. 




 Oh come on, that's just the shadow of the spaceship from Independence day 




 It supposedly works by taking many pics at once with varying degrees of focus, kind of like a compound eye. I wonder if it can zoom. 

Since there are so many mini-lenses, resolution is supposedly a problem. Hopefully they can work that out. 

Awesome concept, really! 




 Oh the Bengal ones sacrifice lots of animals. In the nepal animal sacrifice (which was recently banned, thankfully), thousands of animals are sacrificed at once.

Some of our customs have us cutting a pumpkin and putting red powder in them. This is nothing but a euphemized (okay that's not a word supposedly, but please let it pass) version of animal sacrifice. 




 Yeah, you're right of course :) 

However, it's also important that we don't really have a religious text. Some say the vedas are it (Sanathana Dharma), some say the Bhagavad gita is it (ISKCON), some say there's no text and we're awesome because of it (the moderate ones)....EDIT: To add, there are even some that say that we are not even a religion, only a way of life.  




 Because the facilities suck at all levels. I was in my undergrad team and we had a coach who didn't really care (he wasn't paid much at all, to be fair). Even then, when we once played against a "professional" (equivalent of the third division in other countries) club, we had better uniforms than them. They came to the field by public transport.

There's no money going into soccer. Two of the top clubs in the Indian subcontinent -- Mahindra United and JCT, disbanded recently because of a lack of money. LINK: http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110621/jsp/sports/story_14140274.jsp

And course there's the famous story of the Indian soccer team not going to the world cup because no one sponsored shoes for them. They qualified by default though. 



 




 Oh the caste system exists and is alive and well. People marry in the same caste. People kill for caste. People look away for caste. People get reservations for caste. People get votes for caste. Like you say, the exceptions (us, probably?) don't make the rules

And there are brahmins who eat meat religiously too (fish eaters in the coastal regions), though I agree, they are a minority. I'm a brahmin and I'm vegetarian :) 

Ninja EDIT : I mean, I WAS vegetarian :P 




 Yet there are Brahmins that eat fish (like I mentioned in a different comment). For every "rule" in Hinduism, you will probably find that the opposite is just as true. 




 No. It's religious. There's a lot of pain infliction in our religion. There's even animal sacrifice, though in general cows are left alone and considered sacred for some reason. 




 Umm...actually a lot of Hindus eat meat. Even among those that "do not", some eat fish and classify it as vegetarian. 




 Indian here. Sporting in India deserves a whole other discussion. The national level meets in our country have about as much support and facilities as high school meets here in the US. 




 The pleasures of a pope are none. 




 Depends on what makes you scream. 




 Hey reddit, what determines what kind of pasta will go into a recipe? They all seem to taste the same to me...

I like experimenting with food, so it might help to learn to see the difference! 




 Oh I'm 28 too, don't like what I'm doing, am in a ForeverAlone phase and have no clue what I want to do.

Not sure that helps you in anyway, but if you need company, I'm here! 




 This thread maybe useful:

 Was this actually posted on some news site or is it more like a warning? 




 Descent!!!! Many hours were spent playing this!

I never made it past Level 9 in Descent 2 without cheat codes. Couldn't find the bloody red keycard! Ten years and I still remember it, was a very traumatic experience!

 I'm not american or extremely knowledgeable, but this article still made me sad. It reminds me of the way I'm angry with my advisor (I'm in grad school), but still have to suck up to him sometimes.

 I can't submit comments while using RES on Chrome. I have to start Firefox (don't have RES installed on that) to comment. DAE have this problem? Is there a fix?

 Thank you very much :) 




 Aah..I don't really have an explanation for this. I was looking at/thinking of the sky when I wrote it -- I'm not sure that helps! 




 Thanks! I'll try to post more poems...hoepfully will get feedback on them as well! 




 Oh really good advice! Reading the poem again, I agree with you completely about the claims to pain and torture, especially the narrow perspective.

Unrelatedly, I don't see how honesty and being-a-dick are related, and you're completely in the former zone! 




 The sky is grey

The morning is blue

There's a knot in my stomach

I'm thinking of you


There's no sense in this

The torture, the pain

There's no question if it's worth it

Because I have nothing else

To be worth anything



In my head

I'm fading out

Losing meaning

Each day

I am less than I was

The day before
 




 Who?  




 Whenever I've seen people fishing, it's been with kids :) Though I've seen them catching fish continuously...

 There's Homer Lake (Urbana - 20 mins away) and Lake of the Woods (Champaign - 20 mins away) and Clinton Lake (30 mins away) all of which offer fishing. I've seen many people fishing in Homer Lake for sure. Don't know if you need a license...

There's Kickapoo State Park (30 mins) and Turkey run (90 mins) if you're looking to do some Kayaking/Fishing/Boating/Camping

 Hey, 

Sorry for the late reply, but I would totally be up for next semester. I have an electronic drumkit since I live in an apartment..

I am into pretty much everything, from metal to pop and a little bit of hip hop. These days, I'm listening to a lot of jazz and reggae though I haven't really played anything like it. 
 
Really, any kind of music will do. I just want to actually play with people instead of the computer.

 That just means that she wasn't running as fast she could have without falling down. 




 I'm a reddi. I was born reddi.

On further thought, I may have stopped a sentence halfway there. I tend to  




 Yesterday evening, I realized reddit was the greatest website ever when I saw that these two things were on the same page:

1. The hottest youtube video I've ever seen: [Hot youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs8YthlglKk)

2. An AMA with an astronaut: [Astronaut AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gm8rh/iaman_astronaut_who_has_been_to_space_twice_and/)

So the two most important things in life for me were in the same place at the same time...Couldn't ask for much more in a day! 


P.S : I'm still new to the whole reddi 




 Actually, the poem was written in three paragraphs with the same lines as above. When I pasted it onto reddit, the formatting disappeared, and I couldn't get the paragraphs to work.

However, when I reread it, I saw that the paragraphs weren't really adding anything in the sense that everything I wanted to say, I was still saying, so I let it be.

I'm no poet though and I don't know the rules. I just press Enter when I feel a pause in my thoughts to start a new line :) 




 That's a nice quote. I'm no Hemingway, though I could be the boy. Or the fish :) 




 They are an actual wolf and an actual stuffed monkey, not metaphors or anything :)

Thanks! 




 On the sand

By Michigan Lake

And in the forest

By the sand

I thought

Of holding your hand

And walking with you

Instead of beside


After I moved a log

To make way for the queen

I buried my hands

In my sweatshirt

And played with

The lighter



Yes, the same lighter

That refused

To light our cigarettes

And robbed me of that moment

Where I would be sitting with you

Smoking by the lake

Listening to the clamour of the waves




In the curiously romantic

Silence of winter brown trees

I burned your

Stuffed monkeys tail

And felt the

Pleasant distraction

Of the heat on my palm.



You stopped

In your tracks

To look for the wolf



I looked at you

And lit the flame

on my palm again

---

This is my first poem post here...please criticize freely! 




 Ok wow. I was going to post something similar - actually the same thing. I'm doing my PhD in Aerospace and am currently extremely frustrated. Then I found this...The replies are awesome. Instead of a problem being my first post on reddit, it's a Thank you! 
























 Makes sense...Thanks! 




 It's not hard...I just like to leave the shirt untucked because it gets that way through the course of the day anyway. 




 I've recently tried to graduate from zippered sweatshirts to cardigans/sweaters. The problem is that I like to leave my shirts untucked.

If I do however, the part of the shirt below the sweater looks like a skirt. Is this conventionally acceptable, because I think it looks silly :-/

Should I stuff in the shirt under the sweater or something? If I tuck it in and then tuck it out later, it comes out all wrinkled. 

Any advice will be appreciated!

EDIT: Well, the internet seems to tell me that if my shirt is long enough to be looking like a skirt, it should be tucked in anyway! What do you guys think? 




 Yeah...exactly.

The last few years have taken away a lot from me. I'm prepared to spend many years getting it all back, even if I have to do it one step at a time.

Whenever you feel like you can't go on, just let a few days go by. The weather will change or a grocery store girl will smile at you...I never can tell when it begins and when it ends. When it ends, I exercise... 

Very glad to be of help... 




 I am new to this subreddit, but only because I didn't know it existed.

Reading through it gives me so much hope. 

To the people who post their problems here:

I am truly inspired today by your courage to lay your heart out on reddit and take advice. This gives me hope about me, and tells me that no matter what I'm feeling, there are always people who will care.

Thank you. 




 I tried again and again for 4 years before finally giving up on trying to be confident. After 8 months of soul-wrenching self-reflection and a reasonable amount of hurting myself, I decided the following:

I'll make a small change, and stick to it. I won't worry about any other problem. I can't work? It's okay. I can't sleep? It's okay. I am disappointing people who think the world of me? It's okay. The world sucks and the girl I love is fucking someone else? It's okay. I just turn the other cheek and let the world slap me there. I am a loser and by definition, losers don't win. That's okay too.

As long as I can exercise regularly, everything else doesn't matter. The hope is that once I'm able to exercise regularly, I can take the next step. And some days, I can't get out of my bed. That's fine too. I'll just let those days go by and wait for the day I get out and go to gym.

The point is the hope, of course. Exercise gives me endorphins and for all I know, the endorphins might be what's letting me live.

I post to r/Fitness and get encouragement from there. I see stories on reddit and I laugh. 

I'm not sure what I'm trying to say to you any more. But I went through all that you did. Maybe not or maybe my situation was worse, we can never be sure. But remember it does not matter that others think of you as a failure. 

I am afraid sometimes that my family will see me for what I am and their hopes will come crashing down. But these days, I have learned to accept that too. I am what I am. This acceptance sometimes make me smile and sometimes it makes me punch walls. 

But whatever I am, I will exercise regularly and then sleep well, and then dress well. And then we'll see. Fuck everything else.

I'm not sure I'm getting my point across at all, but I hope your understanding is better than my expression. 




 The hurting is in the front of the kneejoint, especially when I'm climbing stairs.

Thanks for your advice about the stretches. I was doing only general stretches, but will include these specific ones as well. 




 Relevant username? :D 

Okay...I guess I'll take you on your word and try! 




 I have two questions...I'm not exactly new to r/Fitness, but this seems to be the thread where I can ask basic questions freely!

1. I used to be a competitive runner about 6 years back in school (400 m, 800 m, 2000 m and 5000 m), but then I stopped. I started again a few weeks back. I run 3 times a week, 3-5 miles in each run, with an average pace of 7:30 per mile (8 mph). 

The problem is that my knees are hurting. I've just attributed it to not running for a long time, but the pain hasn't gone in 3 weeks. Is this normal or should I be worried?

2. I see squats being recommended over and over. But I don't have a partner and I am not confident of my squatting form. Will I get the same advantages if I use the squatting machine at the gym?

I'm a grad student in university, so have access to good equipment. 




 Thank you all who commented! I will be listening to all of these tomorrow.

 I don't have answers to any of those questions :) 




 I know...thanks :) 




 I would tend to agree with the general gist of your comment, especially the part where I'm putting in more effort than her. But changing that requires changing me, which is a lot of effort...

Well, I am going to take your advice to heart and we'll see how it goes! 




 Sort of..we're flatmates :) 




 I would like to say I don't have enough strength to do that. Circumstances too...but well! 




 No...Circumstances prevent the stopping of hanging out to this day. It's been six months now and I'm very tired now. Where are the other women?! 




 I physically proposed the act and she didn't talk to me for a day. I verbally proposed the act and she didn't talk to me for a week and even cited said physical proposal as a sign of my betrayal.

 Also, I will be there. If you come in, and shout "Reddit!" in a loud voice, I will buy you (or the first person to do this) a beer. 




 Esquire in downtown Champaign has no cover and a live band. 




 Reading through the rest of the comments, I wish this was at the top. I believed strongly in the article till I read this comment. This goes with everything I've learned about nutrition as well. 

I wish they had done a more long term study with more gradual weight loss.
 




 "Put down the damn fork" believe me, is easier for some people than others.  




 No. I think the point is that what you call "lack of effort" is rooted in genetics. While some people use it an excuse, it is unfortunately very true for others.

I think of it in the same terms as depression. What you're doing is equating depression to a bad day. 




 Wow...Can't believe I searched the rest of reddit and missed Fitness...

I see that this article has been submitted to r/science (http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/nuhrp/a_full_year_after_significant_weight_loss_these/) and health...but I subscribe more to this subreddit, and would like to see responses to this thread here. 




 I don't know...If the enemy is dropping pamphlets during a war, which government would want their people to read them?

 Oh wow...I stand completely corrected!! An internet apology and thank you to you, kind sir/madam. 




 Thanks! You have now given me specific words to go find the meaning of...Off I go! 




 I did say "rest of the internet", didn't I? Google is it, and I asked.

While I showered in the torrent of information, I came out only wet, not cleaner.

It's more reliable to ask a forum where people seem to know what they're talking about. 

 




 I'm getting conflicting opinions both on this subreddit and on the rest of the internets. Some say they exercise only the arms and some say pushups are an awesome all-round bodyweight exercise.

Which is true? I have a feeling the truth lies somewhere in between...but well, I can't build my exercise routine only on feelings.

Thanks! 




 My mother is a yoga teacher, and I've heard her talk about this:

There are two different schools of Yoga (I'm not sure what either is called, so I won't take names):

1. Stretch as much as you can - This means go only to the extent you feel slight tension in and then hold that pose. Don't push yourself. You'll eventually get to the point where your heels are on the ground. 
2. Use "props" - This could be a something under your heels so that they are resting. Maybe a pillow. Anything.

I don't know for myself which is better. My mom teaches yoga the first way, so that's how I do it. You'll get better at Yoga the more you do it. 




 The study talked about cancer and heart disease. Is that all health is these days? 




 i know this is probably not the answer you're looking for, but it did work for me: Try to enjoy cooking. Look at it as part of your fitness routine. It is also a lot of fun and very interesting to try out various things.

Start with simple things and keep expanding. I used to cook once a week, and now I cook almost daily and keep trying new things. Of course, I don't make anything that takes longer than 20-30 minutes, but there's a whole world of cooking hidden in that time frame too. 




 To be fair, my mom went against her religious beliefs and out of her way to make sure we got protein through eggs in our diet. She'd never even touched eggs before in her life and still cooked it for us for breakfast.

 




 Came to say this. But then saw it said and realized I don't really like the joke. Sorry HighSorcerer!

The written word truly is different. 




 Ah..Shit! 




 I don't know. I like Sex better than Racing though. 




 That doesn't look half as bad as I thought it would. 




 How was your year? 
 




 About the reason for eating this way: I really have never considered health. My mother is a dietitian in India. She's strictly vegetarian for religious reasons, but allowed us (my brother and me) to eat eggs because she realized as sportsmen, we would not get enough protein otherwise. Come to think of it, she also used to give us Vitamin B-12 capsules regularly. She also did tell me recently that for the amount of lentils and beans we eat (approx 0.5 cups per day) plus the beans and the eggs, she was making sure that we got enough protein as kids. 

While I was not religious at all, vegetarianism stuck with me mainly out of inertia. 

When I went to Singapore once, I was out with friends and had steak and loved it. So I plunged headlong into meatland with gleeful abandon!

However, I am also a poor graduate student. So, I don't eat out very often (i.e. I cook at home) and I don't know enough about cooking meat. And meat is more expensive in grocery stores, so vegetarian it is. I started working out in earnest recently and hence this thread!

Though as I write this, I am having delicious prosciutto with fresh mozzarella and basil.

Sorry for the long reply...Am a little drunk and happy with  my cooking!

Also, thank you for the advice on supplements! I will buy some whey protein next time I visit a grocery store! 




 Thank you! This makes perfect sense! 




 Yes, I'm looking it up...

Look at this article: http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/you-illuminated/201102/does-vegetarianism-make-you-dumber

Though this is about memory...Seems Creatine does not help memory in omnivores, but increases it in vegetarians! Crazy shit!

EDIT: And a similar trend for bodybuilding/exercise: http://www.vrg.org/journal/vj2003issue4/vj2003issue4weight.htm

"Vegetarians have lower levels of creatine in their blood, urine, and red blood cells.21,18 This does not necessarily mean that they have lower levels in skeletal muscle, which is where it most matters during exercise. In one study, vegetarians and meat-eaters took 7 g of creatine three times a day for six days. The vegetarians' power output over three bouts of exercise improved significantly after the six days of supplementation, while it did not change for the meat-eaters.18 In another study of vegetarians, creatine supplementation did not improve power output.22

Generally, a daily total of 20-30 g of creatine, broken up in smaller doses over the course of a day and taken for five to six days, has been shown to increase performance.17 There appears to be no benefit of taking this dose for longer than six days.17 After the initial "loading" phase, 2 g/day maintains creatine levels for at least one month.17 Some researchers suggest taking creatine only every other month to maximize its effects.10" 




 I don't even know that word! But off I go to Google...Thanks! 




 I am mostly vegetarian. By mostly, I mean I eat meat only once in a while, maybe once a week and I was completely vegetarian till a year back.

I am also Indian, which for my diet means I eat a lot of vegetables, lentils and rice. I was always told my required protein comes from lentils and eggs. So I assumed I had everything required for a healthy life from a vegetarian diet.

Looking at some threads on this subreddit however, has given me the impression that I still might need supplements.

Vitamin B-12? I'd never even thought about that before, though someone said milk which I get enough of, I'm sure.

Is there anything else I should be worried about, especially since I started exercising regularly and reasonably intensely (mainly running 5 miles, rowing 2000 m and some dumbbell exercises 3-4 times a week)?
 




 Yeah, I don't want to read the logs either. I just want to have a way of knowing when I move from home to office if I've missed a message.

Chrome does that very well with the Google Talk extension.  









 I didn't realize the mistake there, and kept wondering how the first sentence and the rest were connected! 




 Yes, I have to agree...MFA is a great influence indeed! Thanks to this amazing subreddit, I'm now wearing clothes that fit, and thinking about what I'm going to wear depending on where I'm going! 




 Somehow, your amazingly weird analogy makes perfect sense! 




 In that first link, Beckham looks like he's wearing a towel :O That's supposed to look good? Even if it is, no way I have enough confidence to carry that off.

The second one's cool...

Thanks...that did help! 




 I need some guidelines on wearing a scarf. I've figured out the knots, etc. after watching a few youtube videos, and have on basic question:

Does the scarf go inside or outside the jacket?

Okay two: (How) Does the answer to the above depend on what I'm wearing? 




 Oh I had completely forgotten about the Google Talk Gadget...Thanks! 




 I really like empathy too, but I also like the ability of Google talk to automatically sync chat logs as I'm chatting between my laptop, home and office computer.

I used empathy for a few weeks before I realized that if I forget to sign off at home (which I always do), I miss everything that's said till the time I get to the office, unless I open up GMail and look in the Chats folder.

I know I'm griping about really small issues, but it would be cool if it all worked. And it seems like it should!  




 I recently switched back to Firefox because it looks and feels so much better on Gnome. 

The only thing missing is a Google Talk extension. I don't want to open up a page of GMail because I have thunderbird running all the time anyway. Chrome has a Google talk extension available that runs in the dev version with panels enabled. 

Are there any alternative solutions for Firefox? 




 Also, looking for deals on the Transformer always gets me more results on Transformer toys.  




 Oh shit, me too!  




 I did nothing all year. 




 The version on the album is more than 9 minutes long...and when listened to as part of the whole album, is a completely different listening experience. 




 This be very good advice. Going to class and doing homework not only lets you learn better, but also gives you good work ethic.

I took the easy road in undergrad, which has made my current road very thorny indeed. 




 I really can't get myself to do it. Was supposed to be coding, but here I am...I've lost my whole week :D I installed StayFocusd on Chrome and Leechblock on Firefox. The extensions lasted about two days before being disabled!

And I'm sure I'm not the only one. 

Part of the problem is that my work depends only on me and how much I can motivate myself. But I'm sure there are still solutions. 




 Yup...doing that right now! 




 That was unexpectedly pleasant! 









 So it happened again tonight as well? The power plant must be going full swing for the winter...  




 Yeah that's what I'm thinking too...But then it must be hell for the people close to there! 




 Does anyone else hear that loud continuous noise that's been on for the last hour or so? I thought it was the wind, but when I opened the balcony door, it sounded more like a big engine.

 




 I would love to exchange stuff too...Email ID pritamps+writing@gmail.com 









 Really? That's complicated Math? That's some of the most beautiful concepts you can find expressed in a cool, simple form...
 




 Well, Mint's numbers are higher on distrowatch, so it's a reasonably good rumor to believe.

Distrowatch numbers don't mean anything of course, so I would tend to agree with your statistics. 




 I posted this question when I was new to reddit, and didn't get any karma. It made me hate everyone. 




 I have light grey jeans...thanks! :) 




 I really thought for a moment I could pull them off! Guess it's going under shirts, then! 




 By pants, I mean jeans and Dockers Khakis... 














 Was talking to my friend in Miami who has a motorbike and complaining that I really wanted one. She said we should do a motorcycle trip. 

So in 3 days, I rented a motorcycle from Chicago, rode to the Smokies and back alone. I didn't have a jacket and I didn't have glasses (for the first seven hours before i finally gave up and bought a $5 pair at a gas station). She and friends rode from Miami and we met at the Smokies and did "The Tail of the Dragon".

My eyes were red, my skin first chilled to the bone and then burned and chapped. Best trip :D

 




 This is how I read this:

1. Oh nice, a guy got a homeless guy fried chicken.
2. What? The homeless guy was black? He got a black homeless guy fried chicken? So? 
3. Wait? *Reads the status again* He didn't say the homeless guy was black? 
 




 Are you currently a backpacker?

Yes. But never longer than 2-3 days.

 Do you know how to use your equipment well and repair it if needed?

I can use it, but can't repair it.

 Do you know basic first aid, especially for blisters?

Nope :) I guess my preparation has to point in a different way!  

Great advice on the rucksacks walks. I've done lots of hikes with heavy weights, but never trained. This is a good time to start, then.

 




 My goal is to stay healthy, and fit enough to do the Appalachian Trail in 4 months two years from now. However, I have very little knowledge of the Science of fitness and my regime is based only on personal experience of the following:

1. Playing sports all my life (Soccer mainly). I was a competitive swimmer as a kid and a member of my collegiate athletics team in India (long distance)
2. Yoga. My mother is a yoga teacher and I learnt the basics (only) from her.

This is my new fitness regime. Please criticize freely! I alternate days because I was told I should not do the same exercises on consecutive days.

** Days 1,3,5 : **
 
1/ Run 4-6 miles (It's been 6 years since I've run, so I run at the slow pace of about 8:30 per mile)

2/ Row 2000 m (in about 10 minutes) 

3/ If I feel like it, I swim a little and pay a visit to the sauna.

4/ Stretch. 

**Days 2,4,6 :** 

1/ Yoga for stretching (about 20 minutes). 

2/ Push ups (I am currently on 60 in sets of 12-15) 

3/ Sit-ups (On 70 in sets of 12-16).

Then I repeat. I use runkeeper and android apps for the pushups/situps. That's about it. Like I posted before, I have never really used gym or machines before, so any suggestions, help will be greatly appreciated!
 




 That makes perfect sense! I will try squats, deadlifts, etc.. and post again for more feedback.

Thank you! 




 I've grown up doing a variety of athletic activities and exercises, but I never really had access to a gym. 

Now I do, and what I want to know is this: 

What advantage the machines in the gym (and weights) offer over say push-ups, sit-ups and pull-ups, which I regularly do anyway. They do look like fun and I see that a lot of people are really into it, which must mean there's solid reasons for it!

 




 I'm going back now to see this girl you speak of! 




 I just saw the guy. He's pretty boring. 




 I will be dare  
I will be dare   
To be there!
 




 I am a graduate student. I live paycheck to paycheck and I currently owe my friends+brother about $6000. I make $900 or $1700 per month depending on the semester and what course I'm teaching.

Most of that money goes in rent. I have no car and don't eat out to save money, which means I've become one mean cook! 




 Ah...I see your point. So I came up with a clever line where it wasn't relevant...shit. 




 Well, independent story. I was the Instructor for an Engineering course and caught 6 Indians cheating. I am an Indian too and I cheated when I was an undergrad too. 

However, they still got zero credit for their assignments. 

**tl;dr**: Rules are rules when you have to enforce them. When you have to follow them, use your judgement! 




 I really can't believe someone's complaining that their girlfriend wants to have sex.

 I don't know why there's such a backlash against violence. You didn't mean any humiliation with your slap, only retribution. Violence, like everything else is good in moderation.

Her cheek will heal, you'll have your revenge and everyone will laugh at it two weeks from now.
 




 I like ketchup on the side...not in things. 

Ketchup with fries = good
Ketchup on burger = NO
Ketchup on Chicago Hot Dog = NO WAY! All those other things go so well together. I can't imagine why anyone would imagine adding ketchup is a good idea!
 




 This is only for rich people to say. 




 Okay that just made my day, night and week. Have been thinking similar things all of the last few months, but I guess Neil Gaiman just says it better. 




 I'm south Indian. I don't hate north Indians. And the ones I don't hate, don't hate me. 




 There's a bus which goes to Iowa City

Costs $56 round trip...Not sure about amtrak! 




 Just curious. I came to the first world from the third world and while I would laugh at all the silly problems "those guys" would have when I was there, I think they're all very real problems when I'm here!

Well, some of are funny, of course. But most of them seem like real first world problems to me. Is it just the fact that they're not problems in the "third" world that makes them funny? Because when I face the problem (like going to pee when I'm already asleep on a comfortable bed), I don't laugh at the fact that I didn't think this was a problem before, because it is one now! 
























 Suddenly I stop reading  
And my hands,   
They refuse to turn the page  

  
The words in the book  
Become a blur  
My eyes lose focus  
And my mind sees you  

My stomach reminds me  
Of a bird in a hailstorm  

My legs lose all feeling.  
The couch dissolves.  
The room disappears.  

There is only me  
And you inside.  

A halo of pain  
Places itself upon my head.  

And tightens.  

A crown of thorns.  

I do not understand how anyone can find this pleasurable

I laugh nervously to myself  
As my heart fills    
With the emptiness of the night   




 I think your content is good, but you seem to be in the same boat as me. We need to edit much, much more.

I'm having to be frank with you, but you (and I, that's why I'm saying this) aren't "natural" poets -- the kind that write a masterpiece in one sitting. 

We have poetic thoughts, then we put them down. But without refinement, we are just stones on a beach. 




 And capital! 




 That's true :) I've read a lot about his darkroom awesomeness. But I've never learnt photoshop, and I'm trying to get the photos in-camera to a decent level before I try!

If you need someone to talk to, I am only a PM away. 




 Wow :)  




 Not for depressed people :(

Work on it? No.

Stop dwelling on it? No.

No. No. No.

Fuck. The picture makes sense. Why doesn't it work? 

No. No. No.

Maybe I should get off this subreddit. 




 Okay, that's just boolean logic (propositional?). Does not apply to axiomatic systems of proofs at all. I don't know the semantics of logic, really, but I meant the way of thought that we use in mathematical proofs. And transitivity (a = b and b = c  = a = c) is something that is not assumed in logic, but has to be proved.

The theory of vaccines, information technology and all that exist because people were willing to question everything. Which is just what I'm doing. 

 




 Oh I did not know that at all..What are the species of circularity? Is there anything I can read to know more?

The fact that launching a rocket and children throwing balls are similar changes nothing about the fact that we are not questioning the Scientific Method. The thing is, I am sure people have questioned it and have answered much better than me...So I'm just looking for sources, I guess.. 




 Shouldn't have brought God into the mix, sorry. I'm not worried about God at all...I just like thinking about these things.

Of course circularity is useless. When you have a circular proof with no way around it, it means you have an assumption you cannot prove. And that was what I was asking -- whether the Scientific method is such an assumption. It seems it is, for now at least. 

Which is not a bad thing at all. We have to start consistent thought somewhere :) 




 The scientific method is what makes me question the scientific method. That's the beauty of Science (and Philosophy I guess), right? You question everything, including your questioning...till you die! 




 1. Yes of course. And that very method allows to question the method itself. Which is all I'm doing. No God involved :)

2. Occam's razor tells us to choose the one that makes the fewest assumptions as our theory. Nothing about right or wrong since the competing theories already have to be able to explain the observations anyway.  




 Ah, this was exactly the kind of answer I was looking for!

But see ... you're using the method of proof by contradiction to demonstrate that E - mc2 = 0. And that method derives from the axioms of Math, which in turn are derived as hypotheses from the Scientific Method. I would love to see an axiomatic math researcher's (if that's what they're called) comments on this :D

Occam's razor as fundamental law makes sense I guess.

So it's an axiom...which leads to an interesting quandary whether you choose the axiom of Occam's Razor or whether you choose the axiom of God.

While I will always choose Occam's Razor because everything I do rests on it, I can't really tell a religious guy not to do it because half of everything he does rests on the assumption of God :-/ 




 No. God is an extra axiom that you would need in addition to the axioms of Science. 

Basically, God is not a necessary assumption you need to make to explain anything in the observable universe (yet), so God doesn't exist. That's the way I've understood it. 




 Ah...that makes sense...thanks! 




 I've been thinking of this question for a while now, but have been scared to post on here because of all the hostility on here. Though my questions have nothing directly to do with God or religion (only with concepts used in arguments), so I have hope!

Before you pick up your pitchforks, atheism is my description of choice, though I find the absence of God (or his imaginary presence) has very little relevance in my life.

So, I read through the popAtheism of Dawkins and Hitchens. I went reasonably deep into the philosophies of Science etc., so here's some questions I've ended up with (If I'm stupid, tell me, but also tell me why :) ) :

1/ Is there any justification for the Scientific Method? Well, of course it works. But it doesn't really do anything outside of the scientific method. You make a hypothesis, you do experiments, you make predictions, you do experiments, and you smile if it agrees and change the hypothesis if it doesn't.

So that's a good method. But is there any way "outside" of the Scientific method to justify it? Because proving/verifying a theorem/concept using itself is pretty useless.  

So any prediction made using the Scientific method is a validation of the hypothesis, not of the Scientific method itself.

Right? Or do I have something wrong somewhere?

2/ Occam's razor: This for me, was the strongest proof of the non-existence of God. Still pretty strong. Have a question about it:

So, Occam's razor says that given two hypotheses explaining the same set of observations/phenomena, you choose the one that makes fewer assumptions.

My question is: Isn't the Occam's razor itself an assumption?!

Of course, it IS certainly a **reasonable** assumption (far more reasonable than God) with a **valid** (in my mind) probabilistic justification (fewer assumptions means fewer ways of being wrong).

BUT: The justification itself depends on probability, which depends on the choice of mathematical axioms, which depends back on Occam's razor. Circular!

Is there something wrong with my logic? 




 Oh? Really? Wow...

How is it a flaw in security? Does it make your phone less secure? 

If say, they made phones easily rootable, would the phones be less secure? 




 Sorry if this question is stupid: 

I have a Motorola Bravo (very obscure phone) and linux and little patience -- a combination that has led to many attempts, all unsuccessful, at rooting.

Though this has got me wondering: Why do the carriers/manufactures make such a big deal out of rooting?

I understand that it voids your warranty, since you're messing with stuff at a low level.

But apart from that, why does it bother them so much? 

I've already paid for the phone, and am not paying any less by rooting it. I'm still paying the same amount monthly as I did before rooting the phone. 
So what's the difference to them?

It's like saying people can buy a plain t-shirt, but can't paint anything on it :-/

I'm sure there's something wrong in my logic...but can't see what.

EDIT: Well, that's cleared up...Thank you all :) Asking a question in a different time zone means you wake up to answers :D 




 Also, I did not know Sid stood for Siduction :D 




 Did you guys figure it out? The same thing happened to me yesterday.

A new problem is that 'kmix' seems to be crashing every time I login! 




 Indian reporting as requested!

I don't see what caste has to do with slums...People of all religions, castes and creeds live in illegal slums...but since you asked about caste, here I go.

It is important to keep in mind that *different  Indians see very very, different Indias*. So reporting today in this comment is a middlish class Bangalorean (big city) who lives in a nice sheltered area. Like many houses here, we have a lady who comes to do our dishes and to clean the house. 

The caste system is still in vogue, but I would say it's going out of style in the cities. ** For everyone above a certain economic class.** 

The servants (maids, cooks etc) are still all of lower caste (the converse is not at all true). Whether they are discriminated against or not ..... (to be continued) 

(the relationship between houses and the people who serve there are complex and involve many members of both families, exchange of gifts and the such..., it's very common for them to become extended family while still being servants)

(continued)...... it is undeniable that all of them are from the lower castes. 

So I would say (in my India), there isn't direct discrimination, but well...my mother wants me to marry someone from the same caste.

The history of the caste system provides some weak justifications for it, but as the great Ari Gold (Entourage) once said: There are no asterisks, only scoreboards.

Well, this isn't very informative. the **tl;dr** would be: There is no direct discrimination (in middlish class India in a big city), but there are a lot of conservative ideas because of which the caste system still carries import.

On the other hand, there is the issue of reservations in a lot of places for the "lower" castes...but that's a different discussion.
 




 Thanks!

I'll be alright, I guess :) 




 Oh *facepalm*! I had used alsamixer so much back in the day...Had completely forgotten about it! 




 Yup. There was no mic slider...I think veromix was fucking things up.. 




 Oh thanks! Will look at this! 




 I would have agreed with you yesterday morning. But when faced with evidence.....

The problem is with the way kmix/veromix interact with each other, I think...but can't say anything more. 




 I'm on Kubuntu 12.04 beta.

Yesteaday I had to video chat with a friend. I kept my mother's window laptop by my side on account of my experiences a few years ago. 

I installed the google video chat plugin and lo and behold, my webcam was working fine. But...my microphone wasn't!

So I installed unity and logged back into it and everything worked! 

Windows was kicked out the door.

Though I would have liked if it had worked on KDE, because I like KDE. 

Any ideas why it didn't work? I am using veromix with pulseaudio on KDE and the default soundmenu on unity. 




 Magnificent!!! :) 




 That's cool. I wish I was around so you would have an extra shoulder :) 




 Hang in there. I can't help you with much really, but I can tell you this after being through a lot education:

Take the courses you like! Work hard! Learn stuff! IT DOES NOT MATTER if you're unintelligent and you fail. IT DOES NOT MATTER if you're super intelligent and you get an A.

I mean, it does matter for a while, but believe me. I've failed and gotten As on courses and in a few years, all that will matter is that you took the courses you liked and tried to learn. 

Keep learning, keep studying. Keep working. Keep trying. 

You'll cry on some nights. Maybe many nights. Get through them and when you're reasonably okay again, focus on what you want and keep trying to do it.  




 **tl;dr** (Very long post... so putting a tl;dr at the top and the bottom): Was getting energy back in life. Lost it all again. Help needed.

I have to admit, I have not been diagnosed as depressed. I haven't even seen a therapist yet in my life. So I'm sure my problems aren't half as serious as the problems on this subreddit. Maybe I'm just weak. 28, male, single, failure, you know the usual. In any case, I would really appreciate some help.

Much of the last year was spent in a haze or sorrow and anger, mostly over a girl. It's not an uncommon story. I liked her, wasn't confident, didn't tell her (also, she had a boyfriend) and so traveled to the friendzone. (EDIT to add details: Burnt my fingers with cigarettes a few times, punched many trees and walls till my knuckles swelled up and I couldn't write a few times, drank a lot of whisky...nothing extraordinary inasmuch as life goes). Told her eventually and was told I had betrayed her 

(which was true, I don't deny. I should have told her long before...but it was lack of confidence, not an intention of ... oh whatever). 

We became friends again. We're roommates too now, so sometimes (since I see her daily) things still hurt in my heart. You know, the usual.

I am also doing a PhD in what would be considered one of the top 5 universities in my field with one of the top 2 people in my field. I said all that to indicate the irony that I'm going nowhere with it. He doesn't care what I do. If I was self-motivated enough to do something about all this, it would all work out. All I need to do is sit down and work. But I don't. You know, weak...the usual.

The end of last year, I decided I would turn a new leaf and fix my life, one step at a time, however small those steps were. I told some people on this very subreddit about my brilliant idea and got a lot of encouragement, and was even told I helped one or two! I started exercising, and dressing better and walking with my back straight. It was all getting better.

Then my mom got two tumours in her spine. She had one in her brain, and was on the road to recovery (or the equivalent for brain tumours). She had survived (even lived, you could say) two years longer than the 18 months she was promised. And then two completely new guys cropped up in her spine. Now she's completely immobile. I came back home to help and now can't go back to university for useless visa issues. 

Which means I might lose my job. 

The thing is, I was okay with all of this. But today morning, I realized I've lost all energy. Completely drained. I have close friends, but I don't particularly want to talk to any of them about it, becuase I've realized they don't understand. You know, the usual.

So, please help reddit. I have no energy left to start all over again on my smallStepsTheory.

**tl;dr**: Was getting energy back in life. Lost it all again. Help needed.
 




 Ah okay, that makes sense...thanks! I was wondering what was changing in the wings... 




 Loaded in what way? Cargo? Why do the wings differ in height when the cargo is loaded? 




 I maybe stupidly misinformed...but is Prince Philip the queen's husband?

"The queen's husband Prince Philip..."

EDIT Oh nevermind. Someone else asked and was answered below
 




 The kid doesn't understand much because he's young...that's what I think/thought. 




 There was a time when I used to think this was a song by Boyzone and how awesome the lyrics were awesome even though it was by them :D 




 Interesting answer. Thanks!

I'm not asking if the voltage exists in an existential way. I'm asking in the way us atheists say God doesn't exist because nothing He/She/It/Spaghetti does is measurable. 

So for the battery, the voltage has meaning ONLY when the battery is connected, i.e. when the voltage can be measured (or if it can be measured in some other way, that's fine too).  

However, before the battery is connected, the voltage is still Measurable, because I know that connecting the terminals will set up a current etc. 

I was wondering if the above two things are in fact the same, and it is meaningless to talk about the "measurability" of something without actually keeping the possibility of measuring it in mind. 




 So is its existence accepted fact? Or are experiments still being conducted to verify whether it actually exists or not?

EDIT: http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/gwave_spectrum.html They (It?) have (has?) been detected and measured...Not sure what you were trying to imply.

EDIT 2 : Okay they are still trying to measure them..sorry :) But doesn't put the spectrum on the same standing of scientific acceptability as the Higgs Boson? Something that's "supposed" to be there, but we can't see yet and will hopefully see when we experiment or else the world will fall apart?

 




 I just replied on a [comment thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/rbhve/how_do_the_heart_rate_sensors_at_a_gym_work/c44l5ra) and that sparked my curiosity about this:

The question is: Is there a distinction in Science between "measurable" and "measured"? Can the potential between two battery terminals, for example, be considered a physical quantity before it's measured?

I guess it's kind of a stupid question....but I' not sure!
 




 This is a tangent onto a philosophyOfScience question... I was under the impression that in Science, nothing exists if it's not measured.

Or maybe "measurable" is different from "measured" ... New thread required? 









 :) Good luck! Don't hesitate to make your step even smaller if this doesn't work! Keep trying to keep moving in the right direction :) 




 Well, it wasn't a waste of time. I got to do a fun analysis :) 




 Oh no :( 




 Never seen that meme used better. The final frame really hit me hard....Completely feel your feelings there! 









 I did my own calculations based on the numbers on his website. 

It's not like I read "I flew!" there and believed it immeditaely. 
 




 Can't argue with that :) 




 Yeah even 2 Hz is enough for him to get the lift he requires. I used 10 Hz more out of excitement than anything else.

He's said he needs 2 KW of power for his weight, which is what the battery he's using provides.

EDIT (because I got some more free time): With 2 Hz, he'll need to run at around 6.5 m/s, which is a pretty easy sprinting speed (with weight attached). Good point though...With such heavy wings, 10 Hz would be crazy! 

EDIT 2: I saw your videos. You have to realize that this guy's ornithopter is not even close to being as impressive as the ones you've posted. This is just some guy hacking together a thing that flies. It hardly does anything new in any way. Which is why I can't understand why people are so surprised by it! 




 It's not human powered, only human controlled. 




 See thread below. It's not necessarily fake. 




 Yes...Fun :) Especially if it concerns aerodynamics 




 Phew! Please tell me you're convinced of the aerodynamic feasibility :)

Again, I can't comment on the photoshoppiness of the thing... 




 You are completely right...Oops! :)

Here really, L/D doesn't matter. As long as he can attain the lift, he'll get into the air. And then fall out very quickly of course, but he will still get up!

However, his wing area is 15 m^2.

Part 2 of calculations...Note that I have no problem with you being right. In fact, the way this currently is: I am assuming you're right and hoping to prove you wrong.

CL = 1.4  
L = 100 kg (Seems he has a 20 kg backpack)  
S = 18 m^2 (From his website)  
rho = 1.225    

V = sqrt(100 * 9.8 * 2 / (1.225 * 18 * 1.4) ) = 7.96 m/s


So, now the question is if 7.96 m/s is possible. It means you run 100 m in 12.5 s. That is unfortunately extremely fast, but not unattainably so. All he needs to get in the air is maintain that speed for 2 s. Then flap hard enough.....not convincing

In any case, I guess the tide is currently in your favour. 

I got some hope based on a WIRED article ([http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/01/humans-with-bird-wings/](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/01/humans-with-bird-wings/)) 

But that article says nothing, really.

So, for now without further information (and even though he flew clumsily and came down pretty quickly), I have to say you must be right, though there is still hope for the man :)


************ BUT WAIT!!! ******************

(Sorry for getting excited. I generally get that way when I get a sudden realization of what I was doing wrong) 
EDIT! : I made a mistake. Flapping CL doesn't depend only on V, it also depends on the flapping speed itself!!! 

Phew. I knew I was making a mistake.

So, let's say he runs at 6 m/s. And flaps at 10 Hz (10 times per second). The average speed (which on the back of an envelope can be assumed to be acting over the whole wing. Of course, the root won't move at all and the tip will move much faster) of up and down motion will be 10 Hz * 5 m (half span)/2 = 25 m/s.  There's my answer...

So the net speed the wing will see will be sqrt(6^2 + 25^2) which is far greater than what is required to get him in the air with a CL of 1.4. In fact, even with a CL of 1, he will still be able to get off the ground.

His low L/D of course, will bring him back down pretty quickly, which is what happened (he couldn't even fly for 10 s).

So I am convinced that his flight is CERTAINLY aerodynamically possible. 

Thanks for your observations...Because of them, I do think these calculations are correct now :)
 




 Ah, that's better.

I don't see why it's impossible. You have a good point there about the lift. Maybe you're right... Let's calculate see what CL is required. 

Lif = mass * gravity = 80 kg * 9.8  
Wing area = 10 m^2 (say 10 m span and 1 m chord)  
rho = 1.225 kg/m^3

Now let's find out what CL you need to have to get a running speed of say 12 mph  -- a speed that shouldn't be hard to attain with significant weight on your back.

So,  

CL = m * g / (0.5 * rho * S * V^2)  
     = 4.45

A CL of 4.45 is not high for a flapping airfoil (This one is in fact a nicely cambered airfoil cross section) since it generates generates lift both through unsteady and steady effects. 

See Fig 2 on page 4 of ([http://web.mst.edu/~isaac/AIAA-2006-0450.pdf:](http://web.mst.edu/~isaac/AIAA-2006-0450.pdf). 

The frequency there is about 2 flaps per second at it gets to a CL of 3 which is in fact certainly lower than for the guy, since he's flapping at a higher frequency. His Reynolds number is also higher than for the paper, which would mean CL is in fact higher than the paper).

So, back of envelope calculations support the dutch guy. 

An L/D of 4 is certainly not high. Gliders have (L/D)max of up to 60. A Boeing 747 has one of 17.  But those are designed for high L/Ds (so is his wing probably, but let's not give him the benefit of doubt just yet). 

A flat plate moving at an angle of attack of 5 degrees (no unsteady effects, so the value I get here will be conservative) has an L/D of approximately 5! (using the formulae in[ http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/kiteincl.html](http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/kiteincl.html))

So L/D of 4 is achievable too. In any case, I'm sure his drag was pretty high, which is why he came down so quickly.

So I guess your apprehensions are answered. I had fun doing the calculations :)

I mean, look at the guy. He flew for maybe 100 m and then came back down. It's not particularly impressive. But it's certainly not impossible.

A different thread on reddit however, talks about inconsistencies in the video (pixels and what not). Now, my specialty is aerodynamics, so I cannot comment on that :D

EDIT: Made a mistake in the calculations (didn't convert from mph to m/s) 




 Right...because that's what believers do when they see something they doubt. They go hunting for answers to their questions. 




 You're not crazy, but it's probably not fake. Some common arguments against it:

1. Human power is not sufficient for this: The aircraft if NOT human powered. A wii controller picks up his motions , passes through an Android phone which does the processing to give similar motion to the wings. 

2. Flat wings can't generate lift/Up-down wing motion can't generate lift: The motion is not up-down. The wing is not flat. The cross section is an airfoil designed and the wing is designed with spars and ribs just like any model aircraft.

It required some digging and reliance on Google translate on the man's dutch website to get the above information.

So, you're not crazy, but it's not fake. It's also not that impressive. The thing basically is just an ornithopter that is getting it's control input from a human.  




 Shankar Tucker not equal to John McLaughlin. He plays songs from movies and in general, I like the original more.

In any case, that's just my opinion. Indian Classical Fusion FTW! 




 The next morning. In fact, it's worse today, which is the next-to-next morning after the swelling. 




 I had been waiting a long time for someone to teach me to use the weights and bars in the gym. I have always been more of a running+stretching kind of guy.

So two days ago, I met a friend with whom I worked out for an hour. We did squats, bench presses and bicep/tricep stuff with dumbbells. 

Today, my left shoulder (the place where the shoulder becomes the arm) is hurting quite badly. While I attribute this of course, to bad form, I am not sure which of those exercises caused this...Any help would be appreciated, thank you1 




 I'm like you, except I'm 28 and I'm starting to walk with my back straight now! Go for it, keep taking these steps and eventually maybe hopefully possibly, you'll wake up more than 2 days out of 7 happy. If you do, consider all the effort worth it :) 




 If you run today and still do 11:30 for 2.4 km, I don't think you have any reason to worry.

I was doing 3 miles in 25 minutes, and now (three months later), I do 5 in 35, and this was without any training program or even a goal, whatsoever.

I'm sure that with a structured program, you will do great. For your distances, I would recommend reading training programs for reducing times for 2000 m and 1000 m races. Programs with slow days, distance days and fast days seem to work best.

Good luck! 




 I have done this and it works pretty well. The only two glitches for me:

1. Calls do not connect sometimes. But this happens very very rarely. And when it does, redialing again gets the call to go through.

2. Texts aren't received/sent randomly. This happens often enough to cause me pain. Especially bad is when I'm texting and the phone is switching from Wifi to 3G or the other way.

3. No texting without 3G.

I'm on AT T by the way... 









 I'm sick today and my neck is sprained like never before. It's hurting so much I can hardly move. 

Feels good not to think about other things :)

EDIT: "Feels good", not "Feels not good"...Shit...I can't even get a post right! 




 There's a ppa available too (and has been for some time now):

 Oh shit...I commented on the wrong thread! I was about to tell you that the OP is talking about the Transformer Prime and telling him about a 7" tablet may not be useful.

Oops. I should downvote myself for this! 




 7 inches though 




 Where is this place? 




 Wow, I am glad to have helped :) The table part is a true story!

I am male and 27... Can't afford (monetarily at least) to think about therapy or medication yet as a graduate student, but basically wasted away most of the last 1.5 years in a haze. 

It's still not easy though. On bad weather days (as [Stephen Fry](http://www.lettersofnote.com/2009/10/it-will-be-sunny-one-day.html) calls them), it's not easy at all for me to believe that this system will work. But I try to believe him and wait for it to pass. 
 




 I was/am in the same boat as you. 

But I have realized that things can get slightly better if you start accepting "slightly better" as an option.

And "slightly" is really really slightly. I thought I would clean my room, I didn't. I thought: Fuck the room, let me clean my table. I didn't. Eventually I settled for buying $3 bin from Walmart and dumping stuff from the table into it. So the table looks clean now.

Tomorrow, I will make my bed. The table will get dirty again. I'll put it in the bin again.

I guess what I'm trying to say is don't try to force yourself to take a step if you don't feel like it. Keep reducing the size of the step till you can actually take it. 

This is getting long and maybe irrelevant, but a friend and I were discussing motivation today: We realized we have come to be depressed because we expected the sky from our lives and were not motivated enough to actually do anything to get there. While we have had this discussion many times before, today was particularly enlightening since we also realized that while not doing anything to reach the sky, we had actually dug a deep hole for ourselves into the ground and jumped in.

So now, we have to first put in effort to reach the ground. Before that, we have to accept that we are at the bottom of a pit. Then, we climb one step out. Which for me meant exercise half an hour every two days. When I couldn't do that, I exercised 15 minutes every two days. Now I'm upto half an hour every day. Eventually, I'll be happy. That's the hope.  




 I am in the friendzone and I have to say, the discussion here is far more helpful and informing than the one on r/funny. 

Though I guess [/r/funny](/r/funny) isn't meant for help anyway. So power to both! 




 Leaving for work. I put on my shoes and my jacket fifteen minutes ago. 

Now Imma sweatin'

 What?! Art majors don't lead a fulfilling life?

As an engineer, I've been blaming my choice of major for my lack of fulfillment all along, telling myself that if I'd taken up writing like I wanted to, I would have been happy now. 




 No. There is a lot to see...it was different actually being here, of course!

Though I completely agree with you about getting out of the inhabited areas...National Parks FTW!! 




 Hmm...I'm indian, and this is an actual conversation I had:

White Woman: So in India, do you really go to school on elephants?  
Me (laughing making it obvious I was joking): No. We have camels for that.  
WW (laughs too): So what did you think of the US when you first came here?  
Me: It was just like the movies!   
WW: Which movie?  
Me: Terminator.

Unknown to her, I wasn't joking! Apart from the action, the country looked exactly like in the movies and people seemed to act exactly like in the movies. 

Hmm...This is kind of irrelevant to the question, I just realized. But...since I've typed it all....

 




 I think I have said somewhere else on this reddit before that there are two schools of Yoga. Well, there are many, but there are two major schools that come to mind on reading the article:

1. The "modern" school - They believe that the final pose is what matters in Yoga. Props like ropes, stools and weights are used to get people to the final pose. This is why it is so painful. This is also why it is good for some people who are already physically ready for it.
2. The "classical" school based on Patanjali's teachings - [Patanjali](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pata%C3%B1jali) is a guy who lived long ago and happened to organize all the teachings of Yoga upto the point into "Sutras". His idea was that the main purpose of Yoga is to lead up to ultimate peace of mind and oneness with the body (and well..the spirit - whatever that is). The asanas are just routes to this. With this second route, most of what the article says falls flat and this is what I have been taught, though I am sure the first method has its own advantages.

One that is completely absent in Western teaching: The guru/teacher has to teach each student individually based on his/her physical and mental abilities and the student in turn places complete trust in the teacher.  




 I can recommend a book for sure: "The Anatomy of Yoga" by David Coulter. 




 That is what it translates to exactly. Sava is corpse, Asana is pose (or exercise). Don't know why you would consider it silly :-/ 




 I went to a cemetery once when I was depressed and just sat there. It was about a girl, so it was easy to be depressed.

Eventually, I felt randomly peaceful and went to an interview that I had scheduled. The interview went well and I went back into the depressed state for a while.

Got off-track there. tl;dr: Went to cemetery and spoke, but to myself. 




 I took up writing and exercise. Sad and lonely makes for good poems that you hate when you write them, but look better later (much later, as in months or years) when you look back and maybe edit them.

Exercise is well...exercise. It's what I do to make the rest of the day slightly brighter. 

I think what makes you think video games are wasted time is that you have nothing to show for it after the act. But you can look at it one of two ways: It doesn't matter, or if it matters, do something that lets you create or that leaves something with your mind after it's over. 

Like poetry or art or music or woodwork or photography or rock climbing or hiking. Those are random examples, of course. 

Though none of this will make you better immediately. That (I believe) is a gradual transformation. Doing things will get you stage where you can look at yourself without the self-deprecation that is so normal for people like us. Then, you can start working on being better. At least, that is what I believe and I working towards. I hope you can come along with me on this journey.

Feel free to PM me to talk or anything! 




 Nope. The respective combinations are...For me at least... 




 What's a cervesa? 




 Wow...I can totally see why you call this a wuss story, because that's what I call my life too. But I've realized that we are way more critical of ourselves than the world. We give others far more credit than we do ourselves.

Remember this: You have a girlfriend (I'm assuming you have a happy relationship) and you're healthy, which means you can do whatever you want with your life. I don't know the logistics of what you're trying, but maybe you can transfer to Science/Math in college? EDIT: And you're honest with yourself. Which is more than most of the world can say for itself. With this honesty and your apparent will to follow your dreams, I am sure you will do great at whatever you finally settle into.

I know exactly what you're going through because I went through very similar things and still struggle with these issues. The issues don't go away, unfortunately. But you do get better at dealing with them. 




 Your post is inspiring! Thanks!! 




 I don't have any good things left and I lost all meaning in my life recently.

I'm trying to get back at life by exercising daily, trying to eat well and sleep well. I am completely alone and I sometimes wonder why the fuck I'm trying anything when all I am is a tree that's falling in the forest with no one to see or hear it.

But just keep at stuff. Keep at something. Keep at anything. Forget about trying to get your chin up. Be sad and still keep doing things. Your chin coming up (sorry I'm using that idiom so carelessly) should be a side effect of what you are and what you do. 




 I asked exactly the same question a few days back in a thread :)

http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/nxkra/new_to_rfitness_welcome_and_discuss_your_getting/c3csj9o?context=3 




 I just want to say that I've always dreamed of riding horses and I have no idea why you think it's stupid. 

Take it a day at a time. Follow Stephen Fry's advice posted on here a few days back (http://www.lettersofnote.com/2009/10/it-will-be-sunny-one-day.html). 

I can only say that every day, try to worry about one thing. It would do you good to realize (only on sunny days of course, try your best not to make decisions on the stormy ones) that while your problems are way too much to be solved together, if you work on one (*and only one*), the others knots will begin (only begin, but it's something) to untangle.

Sorry for the vague advice, but PM me if you want and I can tell you how I'm dealing with my shit. 




 Ah. I was about to edit my comment to ask :) Well, I will be going to the smoky mountains sometime in the Spring from Illinois, so I'll make sure I ask on reddit before leaving! 




 I'll tell you what I went through, and maybe that will help (I'm a PhD student, so I can attest for sure that the graph as you currently have it is accurate):

1. High school -- All cool
2. College -- It goes wildly downhill and then wildly uphill and then wildly downhill
3. Grad School Part I (the MS) -- Similar to college, except it's not as wild.
4. Grad School Part II (the PhD) -- For me, it just kept going downhill and downhill till i was a broken wreck. I was a robot walking around. I couldn't work, and I couldn't rest. I was staring at the screen and it seemed like I was a worm eating myself up from the inside. 

I used to tell people that I had used up all my willpower to get out of bed and get to my office, so I had none left to actually do any work. 

Now it's slightly better. Somedays I'm a worm and somedays I work. 

The days that I get work done give my life meaning and the days that I'm a worm give the work value. 




 India, where we have many other things :D 

Somehow, when I was in college in India, we either went out to drink or we went out to eat. We never really had the concept of drinking and eating at the same time at a restaurant, except for Biryani and Kingfisher beer :D 




 Hope I/someone can help you out there and I really hope you get through this well :) 




 Nope. Will certainly keep a look out for it and try, though...Thanks! 




 Well, beer. As a grad student, I don't get to drink the Buds and the Millers, though I can say with confidence that they're quite bad. 

I'm not really good at choosing good beer, but I can say for sure that I like Corona, Dos Equis, Delirium, and IPAs

 How old is your laptop? On my previous laptop (also Lenovo) I used to have lots of intermittent disconnects and slow speed. 

A CS student told me that it was probably because my wifi card didn't support the new IllinoisNet standards (you know, the b/g/n stuff) and so I couldn't get maximum speeds out of it. That might explain why your roommate continues to surf on the waves of the blue ocean while you languish with a surfboard in quicksand.

I know it does matter because with a new laptop, my connection problems have almost disappeared. 




 So, this is my photostream on flickr: http://www.flickr.com/photos/pritamps . None (or maybe one somewhere) of those photos is processed. I had stayed away from processing because of two reasons:

1. I believed that, as a beginner, I needed to learn how to take photographs
2. I was lazy

I decided some time back that I was just avoiding processing for no real reason and everyone was doing it anyway. So I decided I would learn Lightroom. I actually posted on here and got great feedback on learning how to use Lightroom (http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/xc64s/postprocessing/) 

My first chance to use my skills on photos from a recent trip to Yosemite.

Here are my thoughts:

1. **While taking pictures**, I was less worried about the getting the settings right. At one point, getting the camera back from a friend, I continued shooting in Auto and thinking to myself that the overexposure could easily be fixed in Lightroom. I realized even at that point in time that I wasn't enjoying myself with taking pictures as much as I usually do. The composition half was the same, of course, but I was no longer playing with settings and irritating my friend to stand still while I tried various combinations.

2. **While processing** I really hated correcting the setting mistakes. I was really ashamed of the pics that were underexposed, overexposed etc. _It turns out that at some point in my discovery of photography, I had grown to love the process of making sure the composition and settings were right in camera_.

3. **While processing** I really, really came to love the crop tool. Having never used it before, I had never imagined that just cutting out part of a photo could be so powerful in getting the feeling I want from a photograph across.

4. Processing takes up much more time than I thought and as far as Lightroom is concerned, is very monotonous. Lightroom is designed to reduce this monotony, I know. But it's still a pain..

Anyway, I just wanted to put this out there and get some opinions from /r/photography on the whole processing...process. None of my friends are into photography like I am, so reddit is where I talk about this stuff. What do you guys post-process for? What's your philosophy on it?

I think I see the point of processing for professional photographers, where the end product is all-important. But for me, I think I will stay away from post-processing (except for cropping, that shit is awesome) and _enjoy the process of taking the pictures_ more. 

**tl;dr** Tried post-processing...see the point, but don't really think it's for me. What do you guys think?

 I'm using the Windows 8 free consumer preview right now. It's not too shabby. The thing is, for me, Metro turned out to be a gimmick.

Well, that Start Button is missing, but typing *Super+Q* instead of *Super* wasn't too much of a stretch.

It does look better and the animations seem more mature for sure.

Though if I had to pay, I wouldn't upgrade.

I don't want bells and whistles, just a backpack that will last through a lot of trips. 




 It depends. Waves interfere. The sounds from the two machines may cancel each other out, add on to each other or any combination in between depending on the relative phase of the waves.

Also, decibels are a logarithmic scale. 




 Especially since you're sending 4 texts over two months. That's perfectly fine. 




  don't take nice pictures, take useful pictures.
  I want to feel it

All this is after you take lots of pictures. Take pictures. Crappy pictures of air conditioners where you obsess over the angle of the vents. Pictures of dogs, where you try to frame one nostril and a leaf. You get the idea. 

It's like that common saying that you need 10000 hours to become an expert. If you want to feel, you have to learn to feel. Just keep taking pictures. 

INTERNALIZE ALL THE CONCEPTS!

You should be having fun taking pictures. Take your camera everywhere, or at least walk it on a tight leash for an hour every day. Eventually you'll find that the camera is asking you to click pictures of that strange glow on the sidewalk at night.

**tl;dr: The more you internalize, the less you have to think about while shooting** 




 Yes, the horse's eye. No...Red eye removal did not work at all. IT complained that it couldn't detect a red eye.

Is there anyway I can remove Lens Flare in Lightroom?

 Oh nice :) I actually researched cavitation for quite a bit when I was getting my MS, but it completely slipped my mind when replying to this question!

So cavitation would prevent the onset of supersonic flow itself?

EDIT: Some googling reveals that shock waves in water are indeed, different from shock waves in air...They do exist though. Cool :) 




 It would be the same. Shockwaves et al. The speed of sound is in fact a measure (well sort of) of the compressibility of a medium. In a truly incompressible medium, speed of sound is infinity.

So a torpedo breaking the speed of sound would cause a very similar reaction as in air. The answer is similar for your second question as well.

Though, the shockwave might decay sooner due to the higher viscosity of water. This is something I'm not fully sure of...

Also, of course, the drag of the torpedo is much, much higher and the speed of sound is also much, much higher, so getting to the supersonic region would be pretty much impossible.

**tl;dr** Speed of sound is infinity in incompressible medium. There are no shockwaves in incompressible flow.
 




 I don't understand your question:

 I had RES, but hadn't noticed the Save function...Thanks! 




 No no. I guess we're arguing semantics. My point is a philosophical one and I do agree that at some point in the details, the why merges with the how. Scientists believe that if you start with the merged question, you will get answers to both even on a higher level. Well, I believe that's true too.

But while we don't have the answers, we have to work with our individual senses of beauty. 




 Which guy? I'm talking about aesthetics relative to us.

I think aesthetics and artistry are useful "black boxes" for detailed scientific processes in our body which we don't understand fully. 

It's like programming in a high level language without knowing assembly. 




 I came here to say "Yes. Refraction", but I see this a much deeper question. So I will just comment so that I can easily get back to this thread and wait for the answer :) 




 Umm...When a scientist asks "Why?", he really means "How?", which refers to the underlying mechanisms that get the sound out of the bird and how that sound is heard by humans and interpreted as song by a combination of stuff happening in the brain.

When an artist looks at a bird singing, he/she takes all of the above for granted and looks at the aesthetic qualities of the song. These aesthetic qualities are subjective. By subjective, I mean that they involve a lot of processes in the brain and science still hasn't got to that point.

My opinion, that would be. 




 Fuck...Can't believe I've spent 3 years on KDE not noticing that!!

 There's no point using them _instead_ of exercise. They do help in muscle building, because they're proteins.

You don't need them unless you're doing a _lot_ of weights, etc. They're needed basically, if you're exercising more than the protein you can get from your daily diet (so it depends on whether you're vegetarian too).

**tl;dr** They do what they say.  




 Thanks! Will keep at it :) 




 Okay. I can do 60 kg wooden plank, facing the wind (i.e. the wind is blowing on the flat side).

Drag coefficient of flat plate = 1.17

Force on plate = Cd * 0.5 * V2 (velocity squared) * S (area)

Let S = 180 * 30 (6ft by 1ft) cm^2 = 0.54 m^2

So force is = 0.3159 V2

This force will act through the center of the plank.

Now imagine a plank standing on it's side and weighing 74 kg (my weight). Thickness of the plank is 30 cm (0.3 m), i.e. my foot.

Now the weight will act through the center of mass of the plank, i.e. 0.15 m from the edge. 

So the moment due to the weight will be 74 * 9.8 * 0.15 ( 9.8 is gravity). = 108.78 N-m 

The drag (force due to wind) acts through half the height of the plank (90 cm = 0.9 m). So the moment is

0.3159 * v^2 * 0.9

So equating both moments

0.3159 * v^2 * 0.9  = 108.78

i.e v = 19.5 m/s

i.e. Works out to **43 mph.**

I had assumed I would get an answer closer to 80 despite the fact that this analysis assumes that the plank doesn't exert any force to stay upright, but oh well :)

Well, Wikipedia says that drag coefficient for a tall flat plate is 1.98!!

So the drag force will now be 108.78 * 1.98/1.17 = 184.089

And so the new speed will be **53 mph**.

Not bad...But really, I think all that's missing is to increase the net drag because the human will also exert a moment to stay upright.

EDIT: Also missing is the fact that a non-perpendicular wind would need to be stronger...Phew 




 I don't think we're doing the whole calculations consciously. 

What we're doing (I think, and from a weak robotics background and observation) is akin to closed loop control. We guess where the baseball is going to be and keep our hands there. Then keep updating the position of our hand as we keep observing the baseball.

This way, we only need to do basic math (move hand delta left/right/up/down/forward/back) instead of complete calculations (move hand to (x,y,z) ). These calculations are much simpler and don't need to take into account a million different things.
 




 Manning up seems to involve not doing something every man does ;-)

Yes, I see your point :) I'm trying, I'm trying! 




 No. No one's given up.

It's not only a matter of finding out which senses to provide (which in itself is very complicated).

For one, the number of parallel computations in the brain is far beyond what any computer today is capable of. Also, AI is being approached from a thousand different angles.

Take the simple thing Input - Process - Output. Research is focusing on learning (i.e. making a robot learn) how to categorize input, to learn how to process, to learn how to output. And every combination and small step in between.

In a senior level AI course that I took, the professor told us this at the beginning: "People think we have 1 mile to go, and so the media tells us we're almost there. The truth is we've gone 5 miles and now we think there's 100 miles to go"

It is also very important to realize that AI has actually overtaken the brain in many things. Machine learning algorithms can take many decisions faster and better than their human counterparts, as evidenced by tests on medical diagnoses, fly-by-wire systems. To me somehow, even though these things aren't "true" intelligence, it is just as impressive. 

Anyway the definition of "true" intelligence comes from our intelligence, so we're inherently biased ;-)

In my opinion however, before pure AI reaches intelligence, we'll all be hybrids, ala Ghost in the Shell. 
 




 How do you guys manage?

I'm trying and so far here's my record:

2 days-Reset-1 day-Reset-1 day-Rest ... 

Sigh... 




 Oh yes yes maybe. I have the ATT version and the T-mobile one has more than mine for sure.

But it doesn't _really_ matter. There are always devs porting ROMs all around the place.

EDIT: Not sure where you can check this. But galaxys2root.com is a good place for the S2. If you just poke around XDA long enough, you'll suddenly find one day that you have an opinion! 




 I can answer some questions:

Will the S2 be outdated anytime soon? I know that it won't be getting Jellybean, how much will I be missing?

I don't think it'll be "too outdated", i.e. it'll only feel outdated if you feel jealous of people who will have better phones than you. It will be able to everything you want.

Unofficial Jellybean builds are already out. I used Jellybean for a few days. Was a lot of fun. Google now is really cool. You have to root, of course.

How big is the switch from Gingerbread to ICS? 

ICS is like Windows XP to Windows 7

If I root the phone, can I get rid of the bloatware that service provider install on the phone ?

Yes.

Can I brick the phone while rooting? If yes can it be unbricked?

Yes. Yes.

Can the S2 be used as a wifi hotspot for my ipad? I know it can be done with android tablet but I'm not sure about the ipad.

It can be used as a hotspot yes. I can't see why anything that can connect to wifi can't connect to it.

Does the phone matter when used as a hotspot i.e. any differences (network-wise) between S2 and an older android phone? -What's the best variant of the S2 to buy, I think I got some choices between i9100, i9100P, i9100G and the T-mobile's one (SGH-T989)?

No idea. But the T-mobile phone has more ROMs, so more hacking fun.

Just to make sure I'm not missing on anything: is there any better choice than the S2? Something with the lastest hardware/software like the S3 but with similar shape/form factor as the S2/Ip4?

Of course everything with better hardware is better! 




 Aerospace Engineer here, but guessing nevertheless!

1/ The wind conditions would be very very unpredictable for one. Lack in wind and the rover doesn't land. We don't have wind measurements at all the heights that the Mars rover is going to land in, so calibrating the supply would be a big headache.

2/ Power requirements: Maybe whatever they're using is just more efficient. Maybe it's easier to design.

3/ A rotating thing in space just seems to make bad engineering sense to me. One broken blade, one screw comes loose and everything goes to the dogs. No moving parts unless necessary (I see you have something against comments that mention moving parts, but really...even if there were a hundred moving parts and you could avoid the next one, you should. Moving parts suck)

4/ There is probably a complicated control law governing the output of the supply. Such output control would be much harder with a wind turbine, whose output actually depends on external factors, which is not the case for the thermoelectric supply.

**tl;dr**: Hard to predict, hard to control, hard to build  




 The tiles are for shielding. The material is what makes the difference. I don't think anything else really matters.

I saw a demonstration once where a guy held a space shuttle tile from one side. A flame torch was blown on the other side for more than 5 minutes and the heat didn't reach his hand at all! The material is really, really heat resistant. 

And a lot of them are white too :-/

EDIT: Added a comma. 




 Those are some useful suggestions....Thanks a lot for taking the time!

Really cool pictures...I was going to move to 500px, but after seeing the pics of people who've added me as a contact, I'm going to stay on Flickr!  




 Yeah, I've read a lot about the stuff that was done in the dark room, and the stuff Ansel Adams did. That's where the choice of many of the tools and presets available in Lightroom and similar software comes from, right :) 




 Thanks a lot! Yeah, it was a lot of fun :) 




 Thanks a lot!!  




 Yup. I knew that and do agree with all that you say :)  




 I actually have access to Lynda through university! Thanks a lot!! That's what I'll do now! 




 That's what I'm doing right now. But I was afraid I would get stuck without knowing if I what I was doing was actually improving the picture ;-) 




 True that. Making the switch immediately! 




 I started taking pictures a few years back and didn't do any processing. More so because I was lazy to learn than anything else.

My photostream is here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/pritamps (Just lost pro status, sorry!). None of the photos on there are processed. I used to be proud of that for some reason. 

Now, I'm ready. I have Lightroom installed and want to learn the basics (color adjustments, tonal curves etc.)

Are there some good tutorials about this? Books or something along the lines that give me an idea of what good processing is would be good as well!

I did check out r/Lightroom, but it's not active at all..

EDIT: Thanks a lot for all your suggestions! Lynda.com it is!! :) 




 Here are the facts. That's all I have the energy for right now:

1. I am a poor, unfunded graduate student.
2. My mom had a brain tumor 4 years back. She was getting better. Everyone (including the doctors) said she was the bravest patient they'd seen. She was the prime example of how a lifelong practice of Yoga helps someone get over the toughest obstacles. Then she got two more tumors in the spine and was paralyzed, immobilized, disoriented and delirious. Yoga could go fuck itself. God laughed in her face. Now show me what you've got, He said from the nothingness that he is. She's deteriorating every day, and there's nothing anybody can do about it.
3. My sister-in-law is pregnant. The baby was the answer to all our problems. Where if we looked one way at my mom, we would be unhappy thinking about the amazing woman she was, we would be happy looking at the baby, with all its potential for the future. The baby is now diagnosed with Down Syndrome.
4. I can't do anything for any of these people. All I can do is fly from one house to the other, spend a little time with them and get back to my own miserable existence, which involves whiskey, cigarettes and loneliness of the worst kind in large quantities.

I know I'll learn to deal with all of this in time. But what do I do today?

I have no one to talk to. Well, I do. But I don't want to trouble any of them.  Reddit, so I'm troubling you. I don't know why. I'm sorry.  




 I am in Portland for the next 2-3 weeks and was looking to buy a used bike. I looked at the co-op and everything they have is more than $350, which is more than I can afford.

Is there another good place to buy used (well, new as well) bikes? I am looking for something in the $200-300 range.
 




 I'm a grad student who's done most of his programming in Matlab and now, due to speed considerations on numerical simulations, have to program in C++.

I am familiar with syntax and some level of OOP concepts, but most of my C++ programming so far has been on Linux, where writing (in Vim) and compiling (g++) has never been an issue.

Now however, my laptop has Windows and I have no idea what to use to compile etc and would welcome suggestions. I do think Vim on windows looks ugly.

Eclipse seems cool, but seems like too much for me. Does anyone have anything to say about it?

What about QT creator? I seem to see only good things being said about it, but is it still worth considering if my program will not have a GUI?

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the recommendations! Got even more useful information than I had expected! I am going to try Mex with MS Virtual Studio first and parallelly install Linux in parallel.   




 Oh come on. This doesn't answer anything. I think the teacher was completely right, though she could have attempted something, I guess.

Your answer begets 50 more questions, like what are series, how do we know they converge, which leads to sequences and the foundations of real analysis.

Answering those questions is exactly what college math is about, so the teacher was right, I would say. 









 Ah...That be making sense and I be standing corrected! 




 Isn't this a random, irrelevant statistic? Correlating two variables that really have nothing to do with each other?

They interviewed 5000 people, of which 5 % were LGBT. Which means the sample was really small.

And for how many of those people did being LGBT have anything to do with brand perception:

"I don't like iPhone because there are no widgets"
"Android is cool. It lets me tinker with settings"

I'm really not sure what to make of this article. Any ideas?

 




 Is there a decent app that plays Youtube links in the background? Either as video or as audio, since most of what I do on youtube is listen to music.

I tried harex, and Queuetube, but both of those are quite bad. Harex refuses to quit, and is a pain to get working. Queuetube stutters and stammers.

Is there a good app that does this? If it could give me a choice when I clicked on a youtube link, that would be awesome! 




 That looks perfect.. Thanks!  




 Reddit, 

My friend has a Motorola Droid Razr and it came preinstalled with Swype and new languages apparently can't be downloaded for preinstalled Swype.

Does anyone have a recommendation for a swiping keyboard that handles both French and English, preferably together or atleast allows you to change at the touch of a button?

I use Swiftkey 3, but for some reason it didn't work for her!
 




 No. I have the regular S2.. 




 Thansk! I did not know that! Any particular ROM you recommend / What ROM are you using?

This would be done through Odin right? 




 Really? :O AT T?

Mine said No updates available...And it lets me check only once a day.

That would be awesome! 




 I rented a one-way rental at night (midnight). The LEX was $90. The rental was $140 for a day. Gas was $25 or thereabouts.

So it's not cheaper by itself. But there were 3 of us, so it worked out cheaper for us. 




 Oh sorry. I have the AT T Galaxy S2...so SGH-i777 (assuming there's only one model number of AT T S2s) 




 So, I got a Galaxy S2 yesterday...

I had a Motorola Bravo till then, which was a cheap, slow but did-what-a-cheap-phone-should-do phone. The Galaxy (even though it seems like the S2 is behind the curve) is much, much faster, smoother and all that.

It has Gingerbread (2.3.7).

I tried rooting it yesterday. I rooted with a 2.3.4 zedomax kernel (only because that was the most popular result on Google) and my Wifi stopped working. I flashed a Shiyah kernel to fix it and then everything stopped working. After a very scary fifteen minutes, i unrooted to 2.3.4 and then upgraded back to 2.3.7.

So after 3 hours of meddling, I'm back to where I started.

I figure that my problems arose because I was using an outdated rooting guide.

What are people using to root the SGS2s these days? 

A link to a good XDA thread or a blogpost would be greatly appreciated. I can't differentiate between good and bad on XDA without help yet.

My main goal not the root, but ICS. I know I can install the ICS firmware directly. Has anyone tried that?  




 Oh yes, we passed by Gem lakes. We were supposed to camp ahead of there actually, but didn't make it in time!

It had snowed just before we got there...so there was quite a bit, but nothing unmanageable... 




 I didn't have any cold season wear. I had to borrow a pair of thin gloves from friends and wear socks over them! My layers were two layers of sweatshirts and one t-shirt underneath. Like I said, unprepared :D But even with my stupidity, it was manageable, except for the night, which was slightly uncomfortable.

Oh, and wear sunglasses! I didn't and had a very unpleasant encounter with snow blindness! 




 It was really cold at night, though more due to lack of preparation than the weather itself. 

And the fact that I kind of slipped into Long Lake and got my shoes completely soaked.

The climb was not cold at all. We were taking off layers as we got higher!  









 I'll be on the patio with 2-3 people. I have light blue polo shirt on. And I'll be there by 10 PM! 

I'm not sure either how to recognize people who get there before me! 




 It's happening... Meetup at Bling Pig (the brewery) at 10 PM for beer.

I'll be there at 10 PM! See you all there.

Despite all rumors and unintended insinuations to the contrary, undergrads are welcome! 




 Yes! 

I won't be here the Tuesday following this one, but will certainly make it every other Tuesday in the Summer! 




 Get them along too! 




 Either one? How about starting at the brewery? I haven't been there as much as the usual one. 




 I am sorry, I posted asking for a meetup and then promptly forgot about it!

How about Meeting Tuesday at Blind Pig for beer and talk?

EDIT: The brewery (for starters!) 




 Any other Grad students around? And interested in meeting for a beer or two or three? 

EDIT: We seem to have something here. How about Sunday night? I'll post details tomorrow. Also no hate for undergrads intended, all beer drinkers welcome :D

 









 Hello all,

My friends and I want to go backpacking over the long weekend. Any suggestions close to LA?

The only real constraint is that it shouldn't be too crowded.

Thanks!

EDIT: Wow...Thank you all for your suggestions...this is awesome! 




 Wow! Grad student going through exactly the same thing here! Wow... It's scary how much is the same in my life.

Well, I can't answer any of your questions, because I'm trying to find out myself. I can tell you it's really frustrating. It's been three years now (two with non-reciprocating soul mate) and nothing gets better.

We have hope. And cigarettes. 




 This kind of gets into the dirty details of things, but OPs explanation was only conceptual. The ONLY real interaction (that causes any sort of net transfer of energy) between the wings and the air is through friction, i.e. viscosity. No viscosity, no lift. 

The idea is Viscosity - Circulation - Lift. 

There is a net loss in momentum of the air and a net force on the wing (both lift and drag), i.e. Newton's Law. Yes, the air is deflected downwards in order to generate lift,

If you integrate the pressure over the entire surface of the wing, you get a net force, which can be split into lift and drag.

Also, "Air hitting the bottom surface" of the wing is just wrong. Imagine a flat plate with flow perpendicular to it. Air is hitting the bottom surface in all glory, but lift is infact zero (all the force is drag).

Aerodynamics researcher (PhD) and teacher of Senior Level Applied Aerodynamics. 




 Pedantic note: Faster air doesn't "lead" to static pressure. Low static pressure and high velocity are equivalent in a flow. One is not the cause of the other.

Lift is generated by circulation and circulation alone. Your explanation is kind of incorrect in the sense that it does not explain why lift would be zero in an inviscid flow.

 




 I don't like me the electronic (Well, maybe all of it's electronic, but there's a part where it sounds electronic too) drum beats in the middle...Apart from that, very pleasant and fun... Upvote to you!

 Wow... this is awesome. Here's what I said on another poem right here on this subreddit, today:

"I think your content is good, but you seem to be in the same boat as me. We need to edit much, much more.
I'm having to be frank with you, but you (and I, that's why I'm saying this) aren't "natural" poets -- the kind that write a masterpiece in one sitting.
We have poetic thoughts, then we put them down. But without refinement, we are just stones on a beach." 

Thanks!!! 
























 I thought defense mechanisms were one of Freud's theories which are now regarded as useful, but not scientific.. 

EDIT: Yup. Googling reveals http://www.sparknotes.com/psychology/psych101/personality/section2.rhtml which includes the following (*Some critics argue that psychodynamic theories are not falsifiable (see pages 8-9) and therefore unscientific. In response to this criticism, proponents of psychodynamic theories point out that empirical evidence does support some psychodynamic concepts. For example, empirical research shows that there are unconscious mental processes, that people have mental representations of other people, and that people use unconscious defense mechanisms to protect themselves from unpleasant emotions such as anxiety*) 




 Fall in lesbians?  




 Oh...did not know that! Extremely cool! 




 What infinite series is this? I don't get it :( 




 Aerodynamically it may work. The drag and lift both will increase immensely because water is a thousand times more dense than air. And the friction drag will also be much, much higer because the viscosity of water is much greater than air.

So I don't think the engine will have enough power (even if it DID work under water!) to actually propel the aircraft forward. Plus there's cavitation and other issues which arise due to the differences in fluid properties!
 




 Of course, I don't know where anything wazotea said contradicted with anything you're now saying or where you get this idea that the Butterfly effect is simple. Of course physical processes have to occur between the butterfly flapping its wings and a tornado... Chaos theory is exactly about the complexities of a highly nonlinear system! Don't really know what you mean when you say highly non-ideal. Every model has to make assumptions about behavior. That's why they're called models and not reality. 

Anyone who works in Chaos theory will tell you that is in fact, the exact opposite of convenient. It's just scientists making the best (in really amazing, creative ways) of a very bad situation in their attempts to understand nature.

I also notice you still haven't provided sources for your "Chaos has been widely regarded as wrong" statement...

EDIT: I just noticed something from your first post. You said: 

This, and what remained of your post are typical "chaos theory / butterfly effect" nonsense. There is no scientific proof of anything similar to this, it's all "mathematical" with a number of missing physical components. One such component is the compressibility of air, for example, which when perturbed on small scales, the air compresses and decompresses. With internal friction, any kinetic energy imparted to the system is dissipated as heat. Not propagated "exponentially".

In fact, if a disturbance were propagated "exponentially", it would not be chaotic. Don't know where you got that from either...

That's it. No references from you, no arguments against the article I've provided -- no replies from me from this point. Unless we meet face to face. Then we can talk over a beer :) 




  Under actual atmospheric conditions, there is currently no way to prove that chaos / butterfly effects actually determines anything in the atmosphere. In fact, I feel confident in saying that all atmospheric motions are governed by physical processes. We may not know all of these physical processes, we certainly don't know how to simulate them accurately and precisely enough to incorporate all relevant quantities

Oh yes of course! That's exactly what it is. It's because we can't simulate them that we need mathematical theories. And it's because when simulating them, we find many surprising things that we didn't expect. Like the fact that if x is very close to 'y' at time 't', they will then stay close (at least within a certain bound that depends on how close they are) for the future. The absence of this theory is what chaos is about.

I have no idea why you think chaotic process are NOT governed by physical motions :-/ Also chaos in the atmosphere seems quite highly regarded. I also don't know why you think they are "well established as grossly incorrect". Do you have any sources for this? The above article has the following to say: *Most scientists agreed that climate has features of a chaotic system, but they did not think it was wholly unpredictable.* If that's what you're saying, I agree with you of course
Here is an article with many references that seems to regard chaos theory as an important tool: http://www.aip.org/history/climate/chaos.htm

In my head chaos theory IS a mathematical tool, not a "physical" one, though the line is pretty blurry (that's a philosophical debate). A chaotic process is just one where if x is close to y...I already said that. All of physical modeling depends on the predictability of the model. That's really all there is to it. 




 I don't know much about meteorology, but I can say that wazoheat makes PERFECT sense to me. I am an aerodynamics researcher and I deal with turbulence, which has exactly the same problem. Molecular interactions have effects on large scale eddies and so on.

What you're getting confused with is probably the following: A single car may have effects on the chance of rain. That does not mean that every single car will have an effect. It means that some car starts a change, which when interacting with changes with fifty other cars and buildings and miscellaneous things (that sounds like the "Favourite Things" song!), leads to major effects. 

So overall, what is causing the big change is not JUST the car as the butterfly effect seems to imply. But without the car, the change would not have occured! 

If that makes sense to you (and I hope it does!), now it should be easy to see that unless we are able to model the car, and the fifty other things, we cannot predict the weather a month from now! Unfortunately, modeling the car is outside the scope of current computational abilities.

By a "Theoretical" limit on the models, I always understand it this way (and this was what I was taught in graduate level turbulence and numerical fluid dynamics): Since molecular interactions have effects on macroscale events, we will have to model their interactions along with macroscale interactions. Now, these interactions are unfortunately (for us), related! So, the only way to resolve this would be to model all the molecules and all the interactions!! This inability to resolve all important scales of a problem results in a limit on our capacity to model a lot of turbulent phenomena.

Like the saying goes, to model the universe accurately, you have to create another universe.

Sorry, I got carried away with turbulence, but the two are very related, it seems to me.

EDIT: You're right in your last sentence!! Sorry,  I just read that. That's exactly the problem that turbulence faces, except that in addition, it's IMPOSSIBLE to separate the temporal and spatial scales, because they're coupled through various interactions,  a subset of which is the famed Butterfly effect that you seem to despise so strongly :)

EDIT 2: Also, you're wrong about all disturbances being dissipated. First off, it's viscosity (not conservative), not compressibility (conservative) that causes the dissipation. And for many disturbances, they propagate because of instability grow very quickly before viscosity can take hold. See any textbook/online explanation of how turbulence comes about and small scale disturbances grow... There is only so much the already small viscosity of air can take care of. 




 No, I think he means whether you hiked and camped in the "backcountry" or whether you camped close to your car. 




 Nice! I've actually read the book, but I read it when I was 13 and skipped over all the parts I didn't understand, which was quite a bit :) 




 I had read a few articles in Scientific American about this. Two are attached. I'm not qualified myself to answer this question and any knowledge I can give will be a subset of these, since my knowledge comes from there. One of them is from 1975 (the pdf) and the other one more recent:

1/ http://www.scientificamerican.com/media/pdf/2008-05-21_1975-carroll-story.pdf

2/ http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=sean-carroll-eternity-to-here

The tl;dr seems to be entropy 




 The force is not opposite to the direction of motion of the bike. The force at the point of contact is in the direction of motion, because that point on the wheel is moving _the other way_ with respect to the ground. See the link in my other comment. 

But the force is small and does not matter. 









 Sorry dude/dudette, I got carried away for a moment on the interwebz there! :) 




 Technobabble? Seriously? That friction accelerates a rolling body (in this case the wheel)? http://cnx.org/content/m14385/latest/ 

You say "This is your speculation. Not any kind of scientific fact", but you say exactly the same thing I did when you said: "This is also true, but has almost no measurable effect." In fact the difference in friction is very easily measurable. 

I stand by the scientific correctness of all that I said. I already admitted it wasn't the answer to this particular question. 

EDIT: Also, the square-cube law has to do between the relation between the weight (volume multiplied by density)and the size of an object. Did you even read the link you posted? Not the force due to gravity and the force due to drag. Drag increases with the frontal area (S), the velocity (V) and the aerodynamics (all included in the coefficient of drag C_D.. also where the square-cubed law is relevant because weight increases proportional to (size)^(3/2)). It is NOT related to the gravity in anyway except through the velocity, a relation that has nothing to do with the square-cube law. Also, the answer to this problem is independent of whether they reach terminal velocity or not.

Though really, I don't mind the downvotes. My answer was not really relevant to the question. But most of what you said really, is wrong. 




 Trails don't spread in various directions because there's nothing to push them in various directions. Once they're out of the engine, the ambient wind (if any) is the only thing that adds any motion to the vapor.

As for the distance. Yes, that would make perfect sense. Since we have no way of judging actually how far the trails are, trails that are farther away would be (incorrectly) perceived as shorter. That's a good point! 




 Your first sentence does not automatically imply what OP is asking. It is not true that only square numbers have rational roots. (2/3)^2 is (4/9). 4/9 is not a square number, but still has a rational root. 




 http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-do-men-have-nipples

**a tl;dr of the article from the article**(since I took the effort of googling and clicking on the very first result for you, I might as well do this too): 
In a now-famous paper, Stephen Jay Gould and Richard C. Lewontin emphasize that we should not immediately assume that every trait has an adaptive explanation. Just as the spandrels of St. Mark's domed cathedral in Venice are simply an architectural consequence of the meeting of a vaulted ceiling with its supporting pillars, the presence of nipples in male mammals is a genetic architectural by-product of nipples in females. So, why do men have nipples? Because females do.

 




 Momentum is the amount of "motion" in a body, while Kinetic energy is the amount of - like you said - "energy"

The immediate relation between KE and momentum comes from the simple fact that momentum is the amount of motion and Kinetic energy is exactly the amount of energy used in that motion! So yes, they are intimately related.

Intuitively, it's easy to see why the amount of motion is directly proportional to the velocity, because well, that's exactly the way motion is defined (an object moving with a certain velocity)

That brings us to why KE is proportional to the square of velocity. Let me illustrate this with an example which we'll build and then solve -- all step by step.

1/ Think of KE as the amount of work needed to bring a moving body to a standstill (Actually, that's exactly what it is).
2/ Imagine you're applying a constant force to do this (just to give you an intuition)
3/ Think of two bodies of the same mass, Body 1 moving at velocity 'v' and Body 2 moving at velocity '2v'.

4/ Since you're applying a constant force, the (-ve) acceleration of both bodies will be the same, so it will take twice the amount of time to stop Body 2 as Body 1
5/ But work is (the integral of) (Force) x (dDistance). Since Body 2 is traveling faster than Body 1, it travels more than twice the distance as body 1. And so, the work needed to stop it is more than twice the amount of work needed to stop body 1
6/ i.e. The KE of body 2 is more than twice the KE of body 1. i.e. The degree of relation with velocity is greater than 1 for sure.

How much greater, you say? That's your simple math. Integration will show you that the degree of the relation is 2. 

Intuitively, Body 2 will travel four times as far to stop as Body 1 (That should be easy to see). 




 People with tumors etc. in frontal lobes commonly report near-death/afterlife experiences as well. My mother had a tumor in her left-frontal lobe and consistently reported hallucinatory and religious things.

Some more info: http://tlc.howstuffworks.com/family/brain-religion1.htm 




 The heavier will go down faster. Gravity is of course the same for both, but friction will be more for the heavier biker (Friction is a function of the normal force)

And because the friction acts in the direction opposite to relative motion, the direction is such that it accelerates the motion.

I don't think there will be too much difference, though.

EDIT: Why the downvotes? This, while not complete (I agree the drag effect included above is much more significant), is all correct. 




 Not 5 db. The resulting sound wave will be the sum of all the waves, where by sum, I mean the result of the interference between all the waves (http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/waves/u10l3c.cfm) 




 The article says it would need booster shots, but apart from that you're right..it would if it could! 









 I use Endomondo for running and My Fitness Buddy for weight training. The former just works well for me and the latter has an easy interface for tracking workouts.  









 Multiply. As an example, if treadmill 1 says 300, and 2 says 200. Your total calories spent is 300 * 200 = 60000. Makes perfect sense, since your running is the product of the motion of two treadmills. 




 They active damping for all turbulence related things, really... 




 Darktable maybe a very good option for you. It's the FOSS option for Lightroom and is supposed to work quite well. 




 Depends on whether the can can take the pressure difference.  









 Nobody's said it yet, so let it be me...
The band that fits the bill - Porcupine tree
 




 What bellcrank is saying is that the further away you are from the wing, the better. This is because the loading on an aircraft is almost exclusively on the wing.

So the front is the best, followed by the back (tail), followed by the wing.

However, a counterpoint to this is that you have to think about the kind of turbulence you encounter. For example, if the effect is a pitching moment about the center of pressure, then the front would be a bad place, since it would get displaced the most. A rolling moment -- the center row is best. A yawing moment -- over the wing.

Basically, turbulence is a bitch and a plane is not a bus. There is no best place.
 




 Well yes...since the can explodes due to the pressure from inside the can. In fact, it should explode with lesser shaking, because the pressure difference between the inside and outside is lower (pressure outside is zero). 




 Good answer! In fact, you don't even have to do 50. I'm sure 5 would be a good start! 




 The problem is that Hollywood also doesn't render it in real time. The renders for photorealistic CGI take a long time (days even for a single frame some time, depending on the lighting etc). The video is only a sequence of these rendered images which is then saved to disk. Not even close to realtime. 

For gaming, you need real-time rendering, where user actions will control the lighting and so frames (at least the changed parts) will need to be re-rendered.

So while you're right about it being a matter of time, it's probably a long time away still. 




 Oh...It does seems like the Higgs field is really what causes the speed of light to be the limit. So my answer is correct...with the Higgs field being a lower level explanation. 




 Stress certainly does weaken the immune system. That's a link that's been verified over and over through many, many studies.

"Negative" thoughts are kind of hard to define scientifically, but if you're thinking about stress, then yes, they do weaken the immune system. 




 There seems to be some confusion here.

In vacuum, the terminal velocity is the speed of light, which is related to the mass, yes. That's where Einstein is king and relativity doesn't allow anything to cross the speed of light. Irrespective of your mass, the terminal velocity is 'c'.

In no-vacuum, the terminal velocity is the speed at which drag is the same as gravity, so the object cannot accelerate. Here, Newton is king and the terminal velocity is dependent on the shape (frontal area) of the object among other things.

I don't know what the Higg's field is, so if that's somehow relevant, I'm completely wrong about the first part. I'm only an aerodynamicist and confident about the second. 




 Sigh...read article. The point is to reduce the incidence of mitochondrial disease. 




 That Caption gives the picture a whole new meaning. 




 This is probably going to be a little vague.

I started SS a few months back (already posted twice about it). Currently, due to a family emergency, I had to travel back home and don't have access to a gym.

In the last two weeks, I haven't done anything. 

I really don't want to waste whatever little gains I've got, so does anybody have any advice on what I should do, considering I don't have access to a gym (at all...), but I do have space for bodyweight stuff. 

Currently, all I do is pushups... 




 She's no lady! 




 A disclaimer: I've never been to a therapist, and I do not have the money to go to one. 

Two years back (or maybe one and a half), I was really out of it. There was a girl, and there was work and there was my sick mother and all together, they had pushed me over some edge I didn't even know existed.

Even though they were definite causes, I slipped into some sort of meaningless sorrow, where I would be sad and/or angry for absolutely no reason. I would walk around punching trees till my hand swelled up. I would burn myself with cigarette butts. And I would have no idea why I did what I just did.

Now, I can't relate to that version of me AT ALL. Even though I still feel that deep, deep sorrow some times, and a less deep constant numbness all the time, I can't imagine at all burning myself. That pain...

Anyway, I seem to have gotten completely distracted. So, I mentioned my mother was sick, right... she died two weeks back. And it was quite bad. 

But in no way was it as bad as what I call my depression...and that scares me... 









 No idea at all :( I've just learned to live with it..as in, retype words.  




 It's like a group chat in GTalk, but over SMS. 




 It does, as long as they're on Whatsapp too.  




 Yes, me! 

I hate that. Swiftkey has a gesture that you swipe to the left to delete the previous word, but I think it falsely recognizes fast typing as swiping left in some cases. 

And I keep pressing backspace instead of 'M' too, which doesn't help with my inclination to delete by mistake  




 Just leaving this here, because Indian Classical music is all about microtones and a lot of Indian songs (even non-classical Bollywood songs) are microtonal:

 Thanks...So do I just skip the powerclean, or can (should) I add more bench press to the routine? 




 Hello all,

I'm starting the SS program, and because of a complete lack of interest from all my friends, I've been doing it on my own. 

The problem is that OHP and Power Clean look like very umm..."dangerous" exercises, i.e., wrong form can injure you seriously (more so than squats, deadlifts and bench presses), so I'm too apprehensive to try them alone.

In fact, I even got advice from a random cool dude in the gym about my wrong squat form, which made me even more apprehensive to try the Power Clean and the OHP...

Are there alternatives which would give similar results? 

(Ir?)relevant info: I'm a runner (5k in 17 m 30' to give an idea of pace), 180 cm, 74 kg (163 lb) and want to get strong, but not bulky (well...no interest in bulk, to be precise) 




 You say crippled and happy, as if the combination is perfectly natural :)

Of course you would take crippled and happy over depressed. I would, too!

But a crippled person could just as well say he/she would take depressed and able to play soccer instead of crippled and seemingly-happy, not knowing that depressions is just as bad for the ability to play soccer...

Now we're just arguing semantics. I know what you're trying to say, and it's cool :) 




 I'm sure you understand just as much about being crippled as a non-depressed crippled person understands about depression.

Don't mean to be rude, just putting it out there. My mother was paralyzed for four months before her death, and man....did it take a lot out of her.... Depression is just as hard, of course, but being crippled is in no way easier. 




 Everything's meh... all good, all bad...don't know...

Basically the usual :) 




 It's a harmless joke, but I took a while to get it because I thought they were talking about depression: http://i.imgur.com/YecHQ.jpg

Sorry, source thread (since OP is author of comic): http://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/11dtfd/this_new_invention_of_mine/ 




 Could someone link to these posts (that have good links) on favourite bass lines, solos and drum patterns? 




 That snarky kid wasn't worth the amount of time that took to load on my phone 




 Yes! I heard that without knowing it was the theme and loved it instantly! 




  In a round about way, she is teaching inner game.

I think it's the other way round. In a roundabout way, inner game is about getting to basic truths about the self. 




 I think even a one-way car rental will be cheaper than a taxi, which will be more expensive than a Lex, which will be more expensive than Amtrak, which will be more expensive than Greyhound/Megabus.

The last two options will get you to downtown though, from where you'll have to take the Blue Line or if you really want to, a taxi! 




 Sure. Here's a map of my first run : http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/fullscreen/136158431/ 

Actually, the loop above (the one I talked about in the comment) is slightly longer than 12 miles because the run I've mapped doesn't include the arboretum.  




 Another noob question.. Why do you expose for 20 sec in such a situation, i.e. what does it add to the picture since nothing is moving? 

Or maybe the 20 sec is only so you can get the aperture down to f/20? 

 




 Very, very bad facilities and encouragement at the lowest level. It's not just in running. Things are changing (supposedly), but very slowly.

Even now in the US, I can't help but feel jealous admiration when I see high school events with better facilities, more encouragement from the community and just as much love for the sport than at the national level in India. It's crazy and it's awesome.

That's the short answer, really. 




 Yeah one is a fork of the other, supposedly. I like TeXStudio better, even though the menus are oddly named (IDEFix? :-/) 




 I run a loop involving Crystal Lake, Busey Woods, The Arboretum and Meadowbrook Park... Comes to a total of 12 miles and has trails interspersed with roads, 




 I used Vim with LaTeXSuite, but it was too much. Simplified and went to Vim with LaTeXBox. That's a real blast. Everything works really well.

Now I'm on TeXStudio, which handles multiple input files better than anything else I've seen. I don't work as speedily within a single file as in Vim, but I'm learning to live with that. 




 Thanks for the link! 




 We can do it together next May/August...That's what I'm aiming for! 




 Yes I do!

Subscribing right now! 




 Thanks a lot for the advice! Evidently, I'm trying to bite off far more than I can chew for now ;-)
 
Will try to get a heart monitor from somewhere and a foam roller! 

 




 Hello /r/running, this is my first post here... but I've been running a while. I was on my college athletics squad back in India for long distance (well 5000 m track), and then stopped running completely and started again about 4 months back because I read **Born to Run**

Corny as that sounds, I was really inspired by how over-the-top enthusiastic the author was. I'm not really into equipment (including the vibram shoes) or into timing my runs. I just really like running. I've never run a marathon and I never intend to do it.

That should tell you something about the kind of runner I am. I just like to run...that's about it. I run for varying amounts of time, speed and distance (5 to 13 miles at 7:30 to 10:00 per mile) depending more on my mood than anything else.

But I do love trail running and I really want to get to the point where I can do the Zion National Traverse in a day. That's 48 miles. 

My question (sorry for all the irrelevant information, but I like talking about this stuff) is how do I get from a relaxed 13 miles to a relaxed 48 miles? 

I ran the 13 miles in two hours and wasn't really tired at the end (but my legs were sore, probably because I haven't run in a while), if that helps with judging my running ability... 




 Walmart's got full length mirrors. 




 I'm not sure. I came back one day and it was gone. It wasn't even very expensive, but it was new (replaced due to many flats). I was locking the frame and the front wheel thinking the back wheel would be fine because it takes more time to get it out. Oh well.

Strangely enough, when I first got the bike, the seat was stolen, but the thief was nice enough to leave an inferior seat on the bike so I wouldn't be left without one! 




 I used to just bike around the county roads North of Windsor and stop and click on the roadside. Sunsets are really beautiful from there and you almost always get images no one else has seen:

Here are a few that I took (shameless be my plug):

 I just saw this repeating over and over with this playing: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KipH9GLuiiI

Epic... 




 How about a video on how to remove and put in tires without quick release -- especially back tires!

My back tire was stolen recently and I would love to use this opportunity to learn stuff... 




 And I didn't know Koreans etc. started at 1...that's cool! 




 We don't start from 1 :-/ 




 Ahh thank you very much! I wasn't counting the bar at all... So in fact, I was underestimating my values...That's good and refreshing :) 




 I just started Starting Strength and am maintaining an online diary. 

I noticed on one post that some guy squatted 295 lbs! While that weight is really crazy, what I wondered was how 295 lbs could be evenly balanced on the left and right.

Then it hit me, what if they're only counting the weights on one side?! 

So, is that the way it's done and I've been entering double the weights I squatted on my first two attempts into my diary? (all of 70 lbs, both sides included!) 




 I booked flights to Vegas for thanksgiving to backpack in the Grand Canyon. That place is already full.

Does anyone have ideas for other 2-night backpacking trips in the area? Everything's cool but anything below 10 F and I don't think I have or can afford the relevant equipment! 

I was thinking of Bryce and/or Canyonlands. Opinions?

 




 Just make a new post saying there's a meetup at a bar downtown and give a time (10-11's a good starting point) and we (well atleast I) will be there!

I organized one in Blind Pig over the Summer and lots of people showed up, though for the first 20 minutes, I was alone and wondering if anyone at all was going to!

Blind Pig (both of them) are great pubs. Jupiters is cool. Esquire is okay. Crane Alley in Urbana has great beer.
 




 Organize a reddit meetup for drinks at a bar in downtown Champaign! 




 Trip to Mt. Dade in Sierras:

Didn't take winter clothes. Fell into a lake. Froze in the night.

Didn't take sunglasses. Got snow blindness. Was very bad.

Ask me about how to not prepare for winter backpacking trips and I will tell you. 




 Hello,

Does anyone know of a good place to rent campervans in the Portland Area? Everything I found online is for RVs.

I don't mind RVs, but the rentals are way too expensive. So if anyone knows of cheap RV rentals, let me know too!

Thanks! 




 Seriously, that's a heck of a ride with some serious climbs. I can see where this would be a big deal versus riding in the Midwest.

Oh yeah, completely! The only reason I got through it was that I kept riding!

 




 Yeah it was only my second time there... Didn't even know the difference till it was pointed out!

Rode from Stanford Campus westwards (I think) back to the campus! 




 http://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/132959991

And me at the top of the first climb (note the completely inappropriate clothing!): http://i.imgur.com/cRZQp.jpg

Anyway, very exciting it was. Thank you for listening :) 




 So we have to remove the notion that it is a "true captured moment" because it is not true to what we see with our own eyes

That's exactly what I'm going to do now, after reading all these comments...Thanks! 




 Yes yes, many times yes!  




 My friends and I want to go backpacking into the Canyon (the popular S-N-S rim-to-rim trip) during Thanksgiving.

We were comfortably planning the whole thing and waiting for everyone to confirm before we got permits. However, from my reading yesterday, it seems getting permits is very hard because of the popularity, so now I'm worried.

People who've been there, done that... How early did you get your permits?  




 Of course you can use it as a crutch. That's the whole issue I'm dealing with it. If I have a crutch, I tend to use it without thinking, and end up having less fun! 




 Thanks, excellent advice!  




 I was just making the point that you could replace militant with military and your statement would still be valid. 
 




 Militants...Military? 




 Ah okay, that's probably not the problem then. Good luck :) 




 Does anyone know of a place where I can practice drums on an actual set for free? I have an electronic kit, but it's not expensive enough to feel the same at all. Not even close.

I'm not a music student. I remember once in my first year (long ago), I'd asked about this and was told that the practice rooms are only available to music students.
