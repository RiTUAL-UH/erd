 Hmm, where is that? I'm using KitKat also (AOKP ROM). 




 Just tried that. Blocks calls fine, but messages gets through. 




 What, in your opinion, is the best way to completely block unwanted calls / SMS of unknown / unwanted callers?

I'm using Call Filter. The problem is that it doesn't block the call, it just rejects it (like pressing No/red button). So, if i'm near my phone, i can see the screen going on. Also, my provider sends me a text message of a missed call (cause, you know, that what he thinks this is, after Call Filter rejection). So, i get notified no matter what.

As for the SMS messages, i"m yet to find a way to block them. Call Filter doesn't block, they get through. The only way is by mutting the conversation on Hangouts. But i get to see the message eventually, so that's not a solution.

Any solution is more than welcomed.

Thanks in advance.

EDIT: I'm using a Galaxy Nexus with Android 4.4.2 KitKat.

Spyros Panagiotis Skouras was born on 27 September, 1892 at Skourahorian, Greece, the son of a local sheepherder. After initially studying for the priesthood, Skouras, with the help of his older brother, [error], joined his younger brother, George P. Skouras, and traveled to America. While working as a bus boy in St. Louis, Skouras would spend his nights studying English, business practices, accounting and law. In 1912 the three brothers pooled their money and purchased a rundown nickelodeon in a poor neighborhood in St. Louis. After turning the theater around the brothers were able to build on their success and borrow $150,000 to buy and refurbish the old Grand Central Theater in St. Louis. Eventually the Skouras brothers would go on to control 650 theaters spanning coast to coast.

Skouras, along with his brother George joined the Army Signal Corps during the First World War. After the war they returned to St. Louis and their theater interests.

The Skouras brothers sold their theater franchise in 1928 to Warner Brothers where Skouras and his younger brother George were made officers in the company. Charles Skouras went on to become president of National Theaters Inc. In 1931 Skouras left Warner's to work for Paramount and the following year was lured away to take over Fox Metropolitan Theaters in New York, which was loosing a million dollars a year. He was able save the franchise from bankruptcy and by 1942 was in a position to take over the presidency of 20th Century-Fox. During his tenure as president Skouras is credited with embracing cinemascope technology in an attempt to save the movie industry from the growing competition from television. By early 1960s, mounting losses compounded by the 30 million over-budget production of Cleopatra (1963), led to Skouras being forced out. He remained on as chairman of the board though, retiring in 1969 to devote more time to his shipping line business, Prudential -Grace Lines.

Skouras died of a heart at his home in Mamaroneck, NY on 16 August, 1971. He was survived by his wife of 51 years, the former Saroula Bruiglia, two daughters and two sons.

 Contacts+ already have access to SMS messages, but, because it's a wifi tablet, these apps doesn't support SMS functionality.

I don't want to use Market Helper, since it's asking for some Google permissions that i don't know what they do (so, it's a security concern for me).

Is there any solution for that?

 Something like that I guess..  




 Yes. They are unable to do something about it.

The only way I found that blocks them is the "I'm under attack mode" on Cloudflare. It totally blocks them. But if I turn it off (or set it to any other mode) they just come back..

And Cloudflare is unable to help me more, if I don't pay for a premium subscription... 




 Yes, I'm using WordPress, secured in many ways. 









 Nope, only GETs. 




 There is. They are accessing my homepage. Some stop there, some others access content on my wp-content/uploads and wp-content/themes. That's all. they like. Mostly images.

Others stop when accessing my pixel.gif, which i have created by following http://kb.site5.com/security/how-to-block-bots-that-dont-respect-your-robots-txt-file/. They don't get block, they just stop. 




 Unfortunately, yes. 




 I have blocked several countries using Cloudflare, so every visitor from these countries must now complete a captcha to proceed. They are unable to (since, i guess, they are bots) and i'm now on sustainable levels, but this is not a solution. Every country that is not blocked keeps on hitting me.

Nope, no exploits on my site. 




 Hello everyone. Starting yesterday, i'm facing a major problem with my website: even though, for the last 3 months, i was having a very small number of visitors (most of them from my country), the number exploded yesterday and now i'm getting several hundreds of hits. This could have been a good thing, if they werent real visitors acting like bots.

So, here is the pattern:

- Hits from every country imaginable, from multiple IPs. If i block their country using Cloudflare, they dont come back (so they are unable to solve a captcha).
- Analyzed some of the IPs, they seem legitimate, no spam or bot records, nowhere.
- Each and everyone of these IPs has a useragent in the lines of Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.11; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64;
Trident/6.0. Some of them have different versions of MSIE or Trident. But they all have this agent.
- Every hit is to my index page. I believe that some of them hit my naked domain, because i see a redirect. They get to my main page, and from there, some of them, hit a few .js, .css or images. But the majority does nothing, stays for 0 seconds and leaves.
- Hosting provider cant help, since they believe that all those hits are from legitimate visitors (so, someone wants to convince me that users from Vietnam, Cambodia, Singapore, Senegal, Iraq etc suddenly type the address of my greek blog to their browsers, pay a visit of 0 seconds and the leaves. Nah...).
- No refferal, since they are all direct hits.

This is causing me problems, since im on a limited shared hosting account. They also hit my Adsense (no hits, just impressions), so i decided to remove it temporarily (in case Google blocks it for malware activity and fake hits).

The only thing i could associate with this situation is some hits im getting from a bot. They are a distributed computing project, so they
might direct all those IPs to my site. I contacted them (waiting for
answer) and blocked their bot using robots.txt. No difference.

Some of the hits from my logs:

- 46.130.101.177 - - [05/Jul/2014:12:01:28 +0300] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 301
138 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1;

You get the pattern. There is a long list that looks like this.

 That's right, that's what i told. Link Bubble allows you to share the bubble without even opening it, something that saves me tons of time. ;)

 Just tried javelin. It's good but, from what I see, you are not able to quickly share a page by dragging the bubble to another bubble. You have to open the full browser page, then open menu, go to share etc. Am I wrong?

 Hello. I have a [Asrock Z97 Extreme4](http://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Z77%20Extreme4/) mobo and want to upgrade my system with a sound card, the [Xonar DGX](http://www.asus.com/Sound_Cards_and_DigitaltoAnalog_Converters/Xonar_DGX/). Just want to verify, is this PCIe card compatible with my motherboard?

[This is a photo of my motherboard](http://content.hwigroup.net/images/products/xl/217818/asrock_z97_extreme4.jpg).  Which slot should i use for that card?

Thanks in advance! 




 Companies that focus to the multiplayer side of a game and downgrade single to a "get ready for the multiplayer" experience are also hurting gaming.

And no one seems to make a buzz about it.. 




 Because some people think that paying for something means that it's good.

 Tough question. I think that it's [The Cell](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209958/) for me.

Also, i really hope that one day i will manage to spend the time needed in order to learn how to play the guitar. 




  We have been made aware of an issue where the displays on a limited number of Lumia 930 units are exhibiting discolourations. This phenomenon is due to the performance of the display in certain brightness conditions. However, **we have identified the root cause** **and are currently working on a software update that will deliver improvements.**

Great news i guess :).

**EDIT**: [This is now on WPCentral](http://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-reportedly-working-fix-lumia-930-display-woes), with a bunch of comments. That's good, this issue needs more visibility, Microsoft should fix these screens ASAP or replace faulty devices (a recall maybe?). 




 Marlon Brando 




 Nothing. Damn it. 




 Time flies 




 Does God exist? 




 From what i understand, there are two similar problems: the one is a purple tint that occurs even on black menus (i don't have this, and i think that this is software related and already fixed). The other one is mine, with gradient on white/gray backgrounds, and i believe that it's hardware related (purple tint AMOLED are a common defect. Had similar problems with my Galaxy Nexus).

What country does your 930 originates from? I have installed another firmware (from Finland) in order to get the Denim, but that didn't fix it. 




 Yes, i played a lot with this (and with brightness). I can change the purple tint to a more bluish one, but the gradient remains on white/gray backgrounds. If i set it on green, the right side becomes too green.

I'm using the Denim update. 




 Phone is updated with Denim, it's not fixed. 




 They got tired 




 Man, you ask for gold, you get gold. Wish I was that lucky. 




 Got a 930. I'm disappointed with the screen (it has a purple tint and a gradient on white/gray backgrounds). Service says that everything is normal, but I guess I'll try again with them. But good phone overall. 




 Anyone from Tauranga, New Zealand? You're so far away from me (17,607 km). I'm from Athens, Greece. 




 Al Pacino. The one and only. I think that Carlito's Way put him on that spot for me.

Also Edward Norton, due to 25th hour. Although he is fading away for me.

 ['The Interview' Premiere: Seth Rogen Thanks Amy Pascal "For Having The Balls to Make This Movie"](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/interview-premiere-seth-rogen-thanks-756765)

So.... 




 Yes i have. Screen sensitivity is on normal. 




 Hello. I decided to pass the [speaker "problem"](https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/2o91qy/lumia_930_speaker_problem/) on my Lumia 930, but now i'm observing something else, which was there from the beginning:

When i scroll through the app list or some other list (marketplace apps, settings menus and also Internet Explorer) there seems to be an instant "jump" when i pull my finger from the screen, which moves me further down (or up, depending on the direction i was scrolling) a bit on that list.

This doesn't happen every time and sometimes it needs a lot of trying to reproduce it. It's more evident on apps list and settings menu. I can't reproduce it on apps like Here maps, Nextgen Reader, Zedge, Lastpass, Fresh Paint, when viewing a photo or on some touch screen tests.

I disabled double tap to wake and to zoom and set screen sensitivity to normal, but that doesn't help. It seems like a Windows Phone problem rather that hardware.

Ideas? 




 It's sometimes for me also. The (less audible) hiss is every time, the pop/click is with more specific sounds.

So i guess that's the way it is.  




 So, no hiss on yours? 




 Hello. I bought a new Lumia 930. So far, i'm quite impressed with the phone. The only drawbacks seems to be the battery (which could have been better) and the speaker on the back.

The speaker is my main concern for now.  The problem is that, after every sound, it makes a bearably noticeable hiss for 4-5 sec and then (with most sounds) a click/pop (which, in a relatively quite environment, is quite obvious). That hiss is there even on apps like Nokia Camera, continuously. Also, on some notification sounds, there are 2-3 clicks just before the end (but can't hear them on music or other sounds).

I have found many references to this problem (px [here](http://forums.windowscentral.com/nokia-lumia-930/322329-nokia-930-speaker-hiss.html)) but no solution, workaround or someone that gave his device for service and they fix it. Many people say that it's a known problem with Lumia's, and it's something that occurred after WP 8/8.1 (and i have the latest updates).

My Lumia is eligible for DOA, but it's something that will take 10-15 days, since the store has to send the device to the authorized service in order to certify that it needs replacement - yes, i know, shitty service. I'm from Greece.

So, i was wondering: is this a hardware or a software problem? Is it a problem (so they are going to replace my device) or i'll spend 15 days with no smartphone just to get another one (or just the same) that has the same problem?

Thanks in advance!

 Yes, probably, but i'm not sure. Any source validating that there's sapphire on that lens? 




 It may get a little hotter. It was one of my concerns before buying. From what i have heard, it gets better over time. Bear in mind that many of the latest high-end phones have these issues. For example, LG G3 is like holding the sun.

EDIT: Also, many Xperias have overheating issues. 




 So, yes, yes you can. My Google calendars are available and i can add events to them. 




 Yeap, no comparison between 520 and 930. Even 735 felt luggish to me. 




 I'll check and get back to you :-) 




 I bought a Lumia after my Nexus 5 broke down. Nexus 7 is still going to be around as a tablet, mostly due to its great battery and big screen. But, as a smartphone and for daily usage, Lumia is going to be there :-). 




 I'm always extra careful with the camera lens on the back ;). 




 Thank you :).

(Nothing, just the light in the room hitting the bezel of the screen in an interesting way :p).

(and sorry for the bad photo quality from my Nexus 7...) 









 Man, i'm one step before buying Lumia 930. I just can't decide if i want to spend the extra 150 euro and buy 930 and not 735 (which costs 200 euro).  




 I was wondering: does the Lumia 735 suffer from overheat? 




 Thanks, so i guess the hue is not a problem. What about the reports of overheat? Is this happening a lot under normal use? 




 That's interesting. Maybe he did the review with a bad device or something.

Are you using a Lumia Icon or a Lumia 930?

EDIT: I see, thanks! 




 So, this is not happening on yours?

http://youtu.be/JYV2U5kuGBM?t=2m3s 




 Quick question for the owners of the Lumia 930: what do you think about the viewing angles of the screen? I saw on a video review (i think it was from Phonedog) that colors tend to fade easily, from very small angles. Is it true? Is that screen that bad?

 i went to 2-3 big local stores and i couldn't find a Lumia 930 to examine it myself. In truth, there were very few to none Lumia (they tend to promote Samsung and Apple).

EDIT: Here, i found it: http://youtu.be/JYV2U5kuGBM?t=2m3s 




 There are many apps that i'm counting on in Android, but i don't think there's anything that i'm not able to find an alternative for in WP right now. I'm not closed mind or a fanboy of any company or OS and Windows Phone is definitively a choice for me.

My price ceiling is definitely around ~200 euros. it's the specs that matters for me right now. 




 That's it's price here in Greece too. And yes, 735 is something i'm considering. Problem is that, if i finally manage to spend 200 euros, i'm not really sure if i want to get a Lumia 735 or go with Android and a Moto G 2nd gen (same price).

Windows Phone is a great choice for me for low-cost smartphones 100-150 euros), but i'm not really sure for something more pricey. 




 Cosmote and Vodafone has, my carrier (Wind) doesn't currently provide 4G. Don't really care about that, it wouldn't change my mind about what to buy. But i guess it's an extra point, in case i decide to change providers and use LTE. 




 I'm not considering 520 that much, just as a super-budget option for now, in case i decide to go with something extra cheap for now and get something better in 5-6 months.

I'm more between Lumia 535, 635 and 735. Lumia 535 has the downside of "coming soon" in Greece (don't really know how soon) and i need to get a smartphone in the coming week. And Lumia 735 is a little costly for me (200 euros), i don't know if it worths it. 




 That Snapdragon 200 is a big downside, compared to a Snapdragon 400...

 Good choice, already played that :-) 




 Gaming is getting too much fantasy based (guess that's what sells more to a Lord of the rings/harry potter generation), but I'm not a fan of fighting dragons and warriors on the latest massively multiplayer RPG.

Thanks!

 On DVD, it was Pearl Harbor. Boy, when i got it from the local rental store, I was feeling like I've been transfered to the future. And sorry for those renting VHS. And when i watched it on my computer, that was amazing. But a shitty movie. 




 Sounds interesting, thanks! 




 Thanks, that clarifies it. So, are there private screenings of the movies for these groups, or everyone gets a copy for personal viewing (like film critics do) and then submits a rating? And if so, isn't there a possibility that those people leak movies online? 




 So, if I understand correctly,13 people manage to watch every movie released in the USA? 




 Yes,I know about MPAA etc. My question is about the people that rate. Do they exist and do they really watch everything? Or its a semi automatic/by the book process, without viewing the actual movie? And if they watch and judge everything, how many judges are there? 









 I saw Titanic (1997) on a relatively small cinema. The Titanic movie was like a happening, everyone had to see it. So I remember it vividly, since it was a special day, many of my friends were there.  I was 12.

 Hello. Which is the best free web service for conducting polls via Twitter? I need something that users vote via clicking on links inside a tweet (for example click a link to vote "yes" or another link to vote "no"). Thanks! 
































































 Token limit... what a silly rule... 


































 To clear it up, [here is the full text](http://www.ted.com/talks/gary_kovacs_tracking_the_trackers/transcript?language=en#t-343768) from the TED talk:

 Privacy is not an option, and it shouldn't be the price we accept for just getting on the Internet. Our voices matter and our actions matter even more. Today we've launched Collusion. You can download it, install it in Firefox, to see who is tracking you across the Web and following you through the digital woods. Going forward, all of our voices need to be heard. Because what we don't know can actually hurt us. Because the memory of the Internet is forever. We are being watched. It's now time for us to watch the watchers.

Nick Bradbury [said something similar](http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2012/03/girls-around-me-shows-why-privacy-shouldnt-be-an-option.html). As he explains:

 Privacy - like security - **should be expected, not something that users have to enable**.

In other words, privacy must **be a de facto thing**, not something you have to choose/enable/look for. It's not an option, it's a right, it's a fact. It's like peace, health etc.

 Hello. I have a recipe running which triggers every time i make a new post on my Tumblr blog. It then sends an e-mail to my Buffer account using Gmail.

Recipe works great, but it won't add the main image of my posts as an image on the e-mail it sends and instead it sends an "image not found" picture. I have to say that i'm not creating image posts, just normal text posts with an image on top.

[This is the recipe i am using](http://i.imgur.com/atcfFsF.jpg).

Any ideas? 




 Mmm, can't really stop the fan without removing the PSU from the case since it's mounted upside down and on the bottom of the case are some covers for the air (can't remove them).

But i'll try that.

EDIT: I can see the PSU fan turning from the back of the tower (on the bottom) and i think that the noise i'm hearing is synced with the fan. 




 Tapping the PSU doesn't stop the noise, it just makes it "faster" for some seconds, like it's doing some more "spins", like it's losing it's rhythm. I can't describe it correctly.

Truth is i've been also having coil whine/noises from one of my hard disks and from the GPU. I fixed the noise from the GPU by setting the fans a bit higher and the hard disk by unscrewing it a bit. 




 I see, thank you very much. Maybe i'll try my luck with an RMA, but support here in Greece is not that good (it can get extremely complicated to RMA a faulty device) and that's why i'm asking if that noise is bad news for my computer. 




 Doesn't coil whine actually sounds like whining? Like [this](http://youtu.be/HP73edpQwgc?t=2m13s)? Mine is a more buzzing one. 




 Hello. I have an Evga Supernova NEX650G Gold Power Supply 650W. During the past weeks, the PSU started making a buzzing electric sound. It's not very loud, but you are able to hear it, especially if you are near the PC/PSU.
 
I checked for loose connections, tried the computer on another socket, with and without a UPS, nothing helped. According to the BIOS, the PSU is giving the correct voltages and there has been no malfunctions. But is this sound normal?

[This is a video](https://vid.me/Sqke) i recorded on which you can hear the buzz )starting at 00:09). You can hear a similar noise [on this video](https://vid.me/qB2) (it's from another user having a similar problem with a similar PSU). 



















 151, thanks! 



















 My bad, i added a link to my Twitter account on the original post in order to prove that i also like LibreOffice (and that i'm not affiliated with MS in any way). I just fixed that and messaged the mods, i hope it will be restored. 




 Haha, yes, that's true :).

(and that's one thing i didn't like on Office 2013). 




 Since it's Microsoft's, i guess there's a n extremely small possibility to be ever available for Linux...

You may try the [web version](https://www.onenote.com/Notebooks) or the [Official Web Apps](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/07/run-microsoft-office-web-apps-ubuntu-desktop). 




 Office? Office is not an app, it's a suite of apps. Which app do you mean?

 How many times has this been reposted? Over 25000? Over 45000? 




 From what I remember, it has a 60mb upload limit every month. But yes, I agree with you, people should use what's best for them  




 When I was using Evernote, the free version had very limited space and bandwidth. Onenote connects with your Onedrive and so you have much larger space available. 




 [Here](http://www.321download.com/LastFreeware/alphabetically.html) is the directory of available apps.

My favourite one is [Fastone Capture](http://www.321download.com/LastFreeware/page4.html#FastStone Capture), which is now a paid app.

**EDIT**: I have no affiliation with the site or the above app. 




 No. I repeat: in my opinion, YSK that Microsoft OneNote for Windows, which was a paid app and part of a costly Office suite, is now available for free, with many updates. 




 Because it's free and it's a very good app. Many people don't know that Microsoft offers such a great tool for free, since it was part of the paid Office suite just a few months ago. 




 Maybe [this](http://lifehacker.com/migrate-your-data-from-evernote-to-onenote-with-this-to-1560885406)? 














 I'm in need for a song of that kind today... :)

Edit: Added comment 









 Its not when its angled. I know what you mean, had that with a galaxy nexus. Its almost everywhere, no need for angle.

I'll repeat, Microsoft has already acknowledged the defect. 







































 According to them, it's limited.

But there are many reports online from users about this issue. Some say that they needed to exchange their Lumia 930 3-4 times until they got a good one. That's why i'm waiting before demanding an exchange, chances are that even the second one might have similar issues. 




 Microsoft confirmed the issue.

 The authorized service found nothing wrong with my phone. From what i read, there are many Lumia 920/930 with screen issues. It's up to the service if it's going to offer a replacement.

EDIT: For example, look at the replies [on this topic](http://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-reportedly-working-fix-lumia-930-display-woes). 




 So, after Microsoft [promised](https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/2qptfp/lumia_930_microsoft_is_working_on_a_new_update/) a software update for those buggy Lumia 930 screens, we are still waiting. This happened a month ago, and still nothing.  All they can do right now [is "feel" and "hope"](https://twitter.com/LumiaHelp/status/560042370251505667) and tell you to [wait](https://twitter.com/LumiaHelp/status/553279308559417345).

This is not a rage against Microsoft, since i really wanted (and still want) to like Lumia 930 very much, i really like Windows Phone and i don't/didn't want to buy an Android or iOS phone. It's just my disappointment for all those defects (screen is one of my problems, the most serious one).

I'm going to wait a few weeks more, for a fix/optimization with an update or with Windows 10. If nothing happens, i'll just request/demand a screen/phone replacement and never buy a Windows Phone again.

As i [wrote](https://twitter.com/test_subject3791gr/status/560044091522568192) on Twitter

 @LumiaHelp Sorry, you are a company, we paid much money for those phones. You don't just "feel" and "hope", you do and solve asap

Otherwise, make no promises.
