 Yep.  I'm loving how easy the BB onebro run is so far in comparison, though I know some parts end game are gonna be much togher :D 




 Is the auto record always set on by default?  Because it seems like it is, as I notice that when I go to the share menu, there always seems to be a video recording, and it gives me the option of "save this video clip."  I never realized it was on from the jump I guess, it just seems kinda obtuse, and I thought the menu was just wonky. 




 Right now it's Heynryk, cuz that bastard killed the crow lady on my level 4 BeastBro runthrough, and I was really counting on getting that Hunter Oath rune from her to help the waste of skin build not suck ass.  The other Oath runes fuckin suck, and this guy is a dick.  My viscerals only do like, 100 damage with a +4 hunter's axe, he has a couple thousand HP, and he one or two shots me with either his pistol or cleaver.  Ahem.  Did I mention what a dick he is? 




 So, doing it the way you mention doing it (double tapping to start, and letting it just go on its own) you have to be careful then to make sure you save the footage you want, if say, you reach the end of a 15 minute loop, because then it will start recording over that original loop?  Thanks. 




 When people refer to monsters, yes, one-shot is the instagib, but when a lot of players say it in regards to boss fights, they mean they beat it the first time around.  Speaking of which, I just one-shotted the cleric beast and papa G on my current 4bro (lowest level you can be) run-through.  I think I forgot papa G, who sucked, but I did record the cleric beast fight (if I worked it properly).  Will try and figure out this PS share crap and upload it soon.

Edit:  goddammit.  Looks like I recorded 15 minutes before the cleric beast, but not the actual cleric beast fight.  Still have yet to figure out these annoying share features on PS4   So is it double tap "share" button to start recording?  And double tap it again to stop recording? 




 That is way too much work.  I also one-shot killed Gherman in like, 60 seconds on NG+.  He is so easy to parry, and with +30% and +20% clawmark ruins, he died in like, 4 viscerals  :D 




 Really?  That's kind of shitty.  Can I expect the same solid performance once they fix it?  Or from the next one? 




 Ok - so I've had this PS4 for a few months, hardly used it before BB was released, I've never shut it down improperly, never dropped or damaged it in any way, and I think it's only gone into rest mode once or twice, and out of the blue it initiated in a weird loop when I started it up today.  I am currently googling potential fixes and what not, but any suggestions or known fixes in the mean time?  Thanks in advance for your replies.  This is pretty damn disappointing for an expensive piece of hardware :/


Edit:  I tried starting the PS4 in safe mode, but it won't even do that.  I'm stumped...


Edit:  It's seemingly now on, with the PS4 noises/music playing in the background, but my input screen on the TV (HDMI2) is blinking repeatedly on and off, but it isn't staying on enough to display an image or menu.  I know both inputs on the TV work fine, as I have already tested them.  Not sure what to do or where to go from here.


Edit edit:  Found a fix that worked!  The problem lay somewhere in between the TV itself, the input channel, and it's communication with the PS4.  I followed the instructions below, and it seemingly cleared up the issues, and now the input channel is staying on, and BB is loaded up and ready to play.  Thanks for your input  :)

1- Power off TV

2- Unplug TV from outlet

3- Press and hold in the power button on the TV for 30 seconds (while it is unplugged from the wall)

4- Release the power button

5- Plug in the TV into a different outlet

6- Power the TV back on 




 Eh. With how OP you could easily make your gear in DaS 2, the difficulty spike wasnt as noticeable. BB seems more akin to the leap in DaS, but the jump is less and less noiceable, especially as you learn the game and get better at it. I definately felt the pain a bit through NG+, but I'm In NG++ right now and have one-shot every boss so far, and am currently on my way to go kill darkbeast Paarl and then the shadows. Even in chalice dungeons at depth 5, I'm finding hot dogs and undead giants and ebriaites ridiculously easy to one shot.  Now I'm sad, because I'm worried I'll bore of this game quicker than the other titles...  Will probably wind up doing a level 4 run sooner rather than later.  




 Eh, even then, I was more enraptured by Halo, in both story and gameplay, and that was a long time ago. Even Defiance had a better story and comparable yet more original mehanics, and that was years ago too. Destiny is the epitome of "meh."  One big over-hyped, well-polished turd :/ 




 Depends.  If you are going to mostly solo on your toon (as i do on my main), you can do whatever you like, but if you wanted to keep it more co-op viable, for ease and quick matches, I'd stick to somewhere around 100-120, and just make different toons for more focused arcane or BT builds. 




 What level are you?  If you wanted to stay within majority pvp/co-op range, you're looking at pumping your two weakest stats (BT and arcane), and that could likely put you over range depending on what you wanted to do with this character.  I'd say this toon is already geared towards STR and dex, and stick to those weapon types with the quality build, and just make an alt character if you wanted to focus dex and arcane or BT. 




 For most grab attacks, you can mash your L+R buttons (supposedly any buttons) to get out of the attacks quicker, take less damage, and in the case of the brain suckers, only lose 1 or 2 insight.  Knowledge is power! 




 Wow. That's pretty good. My girlfriend would totally fap to this :) 




 Yeah, I'm in the same boat as you.  I bought a new PS4 for this game, and as great as it is, the frame rates and stutters are particularly obnoxious, and quite frankly, dissapointing.


The caves, old yharnam, chalice dungeons (or anywhere the witches summon the dreadlocked slender women) and quite a lot of places in general experience frame loss, and originally when I went into Old Yharnam, I was getting some terrible frame stutters where the sound track/game would make machine gun noises and almost seem like it was gonna crash or crap out.  Woohoo next gen?  As for solutions, well, I'm not sure.  I'd suggest installing some new RAM and maybe getting another video card or two to put in there, but, ahem, it's a console :D 




 Dude...you're totally right! 




 Nice write up, but one thing:  do you really think Destiny was even "mildly amusing?"  I never understood how people could play that game for more than, maybe an hour?  Between the lack of remotely interesting story and characters, the uninspired gameplay and unoriginal mechanics, and the fact they were already recycling levels/maps by mission number 3 or 4, I just don't understand how anyone could stomach that game for more than a few days at most.  Seriously.  How did more people not take a shit on that game and mail it back to the devs and demand their money back?  No offence to the people who liked it, but that was the most hyped turd to ever turd on a turd and then ask for even more turds!  Sure, I get game-play compulsion, but even then, that game was terrible!
 




 Yeah.  Now I'm one-shotting ebriatises and hot dogs and amygdalas and undead giants and ghermans in NG++ and in chalice dungeons level 5... makes me kind of sad actually :( 




 
Shut up and take my money! 




 But who was the mummified hot-dog you got the gesture from in the first place?  In keeping with the lore and the story, I think it was Elvis Presley or Michael Jackson.  Vaati is confirming this right now. 




 All for the PC if you can (with a controller), as there are solid mods to increase the frame rates and graphics, which are pretty mediocre on a console. BB had some terrible frame rate issues too unfortunately. 


That being said, yes, you got better (as from games demand), and you learned from your mistakes. Just be warned that the pace of DaS is quite different from BB. Don't expect to use the same methodology and style as you did in BB. Just be patient, and apply the same ability to learn or try new angles to fight and exploration, and you'll no doubt enjoy the experience.  




 Well - I like how beasthood and insight are inverse to each other, as it fits the story and lore so perfectly, but I wish it had been used more, or if it was relevant or useful at all. That being said, people got way too hyped and spread too many rumors about theoretical besst-mode before the game was ever released, so the fail of that hype is on them :D 




 All the other hunters and humanoids (logarius, gherman, and shadows included) are a joke compared to Eileen's hunter.  He just heals so much :D 




 Yep.  So far, the Cathedral Hunter was the only (non) boss I truly cheesed after dying to him repeatedly for an hour, and I've been in the habit of one-shotting undead giants and Ebriatises and hotdogs and amygdalas in depth 5 Chalice dungeons.  Killed Father G on NG++ in 1 minute, killed Gherman in NG+ in like, 30 seconds (3 or 4 parries), one-shotted The One Reborn in NG and NG+, and still, I have nightmares of the Cathedral Hunter on NG... 




 Play blind your first go through:  no spoilers, hints, help, or anything your first run through, as you only get that experience once, because once you're well-practiced and learn the maps and methods well enough, the game becomes super easy and is actually quite linear, though the great level design helps hide how straight-forward the game truly is.


Edit:  But it is definitely a great game, and the main game is challenging at first, as the way you fight in the previous Souls series just can't and won't translate to success in Bloodborne.  Relearning to fight in BB is fantastic.  Also worth noting, the higher depth chalice dungeons can definitely be challenging, and they keep the game challenging, but I don't know how it will translate for longevity. Also, the multiplayer system kinda sucks, and PvP connectivity sucks as well - can take a long time to find a match.  Hopefully they fix it soon. Have fun! 




 Haha.  My favorite so far was two bell maidens on a higher tier right next to the lamp where you entered the later at, so as soon as I spawned, red spiders were landing on me, then I ran into the room next door with the spiders still and continually following me, and the room was filled with undead tomb prospectors and dogs and the cannon-armed undead giant making a cameo as a regular enemy... yeah, lots of lube indeed! 




 Hotdog Asshole in cursed Lorain dungeon, Chester the Mollester and his Bag of Dead Hookers, Crows that Think They Are Dogs, and That One Fucking Asshole Hunter in the Grand Cathedral. 




 Eh. I felt the same way as I chored my way through the easier dungeons, but I enjoyed the... Challenge of some of the lower ones, and by the time I could make a lot of the community posted chalices by collecting all the chalices, I had an excess of all the highest tier crafting mats (except sage's hair).  And the coolest thing is, once you make a root dungeon of any type, you can create any of the community dungeons that were made with the exact same materials (ie, cursed or defiled) for free.  Worth noting, some of the dungeons are ridiculous with enemy placement and difficulty. Nothing like fighting a cannon-armed undead boss giant in a room fille with dogs and undead tomb prospectors :D


Edit:  it's worth it. And if you do them in progression order, you should wind up with more than enough crafting materials so there should be no extra grind at all. So far I have collected 3 blood rocks from different dungeons of different types, and I b-lined it for all the runes I use the most (like tier 3 claw mark).   




 Yeah. Some bosses you have to work out their timing and you can actually use the jump to your advantage, but most of the time it's a liability. To work around it, I just walk instead of run, and depending on how bad the camera angles are, I lock on and strafe, or just walk and roll to a favorable position, like being at the bosses side or back.  




 Don't worry, the deeper chalices are often harder than the main game :P 




 Even though it took forever, FROM (well, B team) eventually implemented what started as a player idea of having a ring (or item or w/e) to absorb souls to keep soul memory locked and not increase.


Hopefully that lesson remained with them (or was absorbed by A team), and they are implementing some arenas or summon signs and other technical improvements to fix these issues.  I don't understand why they used the wonky-ass bell system.  They could have just had your messengers hold up a bell for you that could have thematically and aesthetically matched the game, yet function in the exact same way that the summon signs did in previous games.  And also, that shit shouldn't use up your insight unless you actually connect.  Here's hoping they fix it :( 




 Don't we all miss soul memory now :/


Sure, it was an annoying system at first, but at least you could find quick matches  




 Not to mention, they are often PvP built and equipped, and often are experienced trollers, er, invaders when it comes to the souls series :P 




 I wanted to like the wheel for some smashie smashie, but honestly, the range sucks ass and it's just way too slow and uses a lot of STA.  I like Kirkhammer, because again smashie smashie, but the moveset on hunter's axe for both untransformed and transformed is just too fun, too universal, and too badass to pass up.  Between the 1h and 2h moveset, I have found a solid compromise between slash and smash. 




 I remember a few people posting about how it bugged out their game - and I can't remember if it was progression, or optional areas, but in all cases, to do what they wanted, they had to restore their saved files.


EDIT:  It might have been some of the other skips/bugs in game, but either way, players should know the risks of possibly bugging out their games. 




 In all seriousness though, don't let other people and reviews and all the hype of the 'hardness' fool you.  The one deciding factor worth considering is you:  will you learn how to play the game, learn from your mistakes, and in general become a better player in the way that FROM demands that you become a better player?  If so, yes, go for it.  If not, then don't purchase it.


While other games play more like movies (quick time events, and simple, easy narratives) that are almost impossible to lose even if you try, Bloodborne (and FROM in general) utilizes the gaming experience in a way that seldom developers do, not just in their mysterious narratives, but they force you to learn from your mistakes, as when the rubber hits the road in these games, there really is no just derping and dragging your way through these game.

Again, the game is hard but fair, and if you can learn from your mistakes, learn the mechanics, learn the attacks and methods of the enemies you are fighting, and in general, become better (as the game will demand that you become a better player) than yes, I would advise you to get it.  If you're not looking something to really challenge you in the video game medium, than no, don't get it.  Good hunting to you o/ 




 Whoa.  Thank you.  I have no idea how gold works or what I can do with it, but I assure you I will put it to good use.... does it by chance un-ban me from the subreddits that have given me the boot?  :P 




 Yeah.  I've seen a bunch of posts from people who messed up their games using jump skips and things like that, asking about the problems it has caused for the games, which seem to be irriversable.  It's still a short run, even without the skip.  Good luck to you! 




 But they clearly bark in both the 'waking world' and the nightmare. 




 Be warned - FROM will ruin gaming for you, and other games will feel like Hello Kitty's Island Adventure, where you run around slapping little girls with wet noodles that have no impact, and there is no risk and little reward. 




 Careful though, and be sure to back up your save files.  These skips aren't intentional, and they have been known to bug out the game or make you miss out on certain opportunities due to the nature of the bug. 




 This game follows same format as Dark Souls.  Dark Souls 2 was B-Team's ideas and methods.  That being said, the game is actually super linear and you can get back to the end game content within an hour or two if you memorized the game fairly well, as so many areas are either optional, or easy to run past.


To get to the first part of the nightmare, you only need to kill Cleric Beast, Papa G, and then Vicar.   Then just head to forbidden woods (or the other houses with lanterns) and get the tonsil stone.  To get to the second half of the nightmare (game progression, not the first optional part of the nightmare), Just add Shadows, Rom, and The One Reborn to the list, and boom, you're there. 




 Yeah. It's fun when they show up as normal enemies in the chalice dungeons... Surrounded by dogs and those weird undead fuckers... 




 No. It's a short cut to midway point in that elevator. If I remember correctly, you walk across a tile type roof top, and if you look at the elevator shaft, there are tiers like steps and you can hop back down to the bottom. Sorry to spoil it for you, but it's nothing too exciting :) 




 PSA - depending on your play style, The -HP ones aren't worth it. They cancel out your rally potential every time you take a tick of damage. 


Also, i feel like cursed gems are kind of unnecessary, because there are plenty of solid non-cursed ones. I use a regular hunters axe at around 490 on the stat screen, and the only downside is one of the gems has +2.9% Stamina usage on its +22% physical damage. No other curses on that thing though.  




 Yeah. Levels don't make that much of a difference once you have a specialized build at around 100-120. That being said, I wish there were more things to spend blood echoes on :/ 




 Ha.  We have the exact same build - except I rounded up to a nice even level 175 with 28 arcane instead of 25.  Now I'm running around in NG++ with a million+ echoes at most times, so I'm debating on raising up to level 198 to 50 arcane...   




 LOL casuls 




 Title says it all.  But yes, I have googled it, yes, I have read multiple posts that say the same thing, but it doesn't seem clear, since I get nothing but error messages from dungeons I try here on the reddit list and elsewhere.  Also, yes, I read the chalice dungeon reddit wiki, and it said something like, "you must have created the exact same chalice," but I tried that, and even then when I try to use a glyph, I still receive the message "you do not meet the requirements" or whatever it is.  And if that is true, that you must have already made one of the same exact dungeons to use a glyph, isn't that a bit obtuse and redundant?  Does that mean you need double the crafting materials for every glyph you want to use?  And does that mean you must leave both tombstones occupied with those chalices if you want to create similar glyphs?


For example, I mainly wanted to create this dungeon:  http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/805577-bloodborne/71574146

It is a Lower Loran with fetid + rotting offerings


Yet, if I try to even make a lower loran chalice dungeon, I don't even have the options to use the offerings of fetid and rotting - so how can I even create a chalice to use that glyph in the first place?  Point is, I am thoroughly confused and frustrated.  Thanks in advance for your replies -_- 




 I sort of agree with him on a lot of it.  Insight isn't relevant enough, the game needs more invasions, it would have been cool if the game wasn't so linear, and I am mixed on the blood vial thing.  On one hand, some boss battles are challenging, and can be drawn out if you play carefully and patiently, so less blood vials would suck there.  Also, enemies can still kill you super quickly in some combos and fast or hard hitting attacks, so the numbers aren't so much of a problem there, but on the other hand, 20 is a lot of vials to carry, and yes, sometimes it makes the game way too easy.... 




 Is this the memory leak type deal everyone talks about? 




 If you stick a bit to his right, not too far from his foot, he will mostly just stomp at you, leaving one of his left hands hanging in the air that you can whack on (don't lock on at all for the whole fight).  You gotta be ready to dodge though, because he will flail and go crazy and slam his fists around here and there.  Anyway, you can totally take him down quickly using this strategy, and once he gets to his final phase, just cheese him by chasing his tail, because he will only jump forward, not backwards.  Just stay behind him, and mind his foot stomps, chase him when he jumps, and whack his tail again.  Rinse and repeat till dead.


Edit:  no memory leak or anything like that.  It just baits him into certain attacks and moves and turns this fight into cheese mode. 




 And to think, I fought Amagdala for the first time in NG+ the good old-fashioned suck-ass way - got my ass handed to me and took a lot of patience 


That being said, it's kinda lame that if you barely stick to his right, you can just whack at his hand and he mostly just stomps his feet :/ 




 Ha.  Just beat him.  This did the trick:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dsd9S_Crp0

No memory leak or anything.  It was hard to get past the first phase or 2 for me, as I got hit a lot, though I dodged even more, as I couldn't bait as expertly as this dude did, but cheesing him in the last was easy. 




 Yup.  Just got to this asshole, and after a quick test go to see what it's like, I've decided that the "defiled dungeon" is the stupidest shit mechanic ever 


Edit:  I don't know if I'm gonna have the patience for this fight. Gimmie a challenging, punishing boss fight, sure, but don't inflate the difficulty by giving me half HP for a boss that would likely 1hKO me anyhow. 




 That might help.  I'm too high level to help you though, not that the levels make much of a difference in this game, but i wind up rolling in 1 million echoes at a time in NG+, so what else am I gonna do with em other than level up? 




 What level?  I'm close to this boss in my game. Just soloed the hot dog last night. 


Edit: but honestly, these bosses take patience, an more people seems like more of a liability than not.  




 There is no proof that Rom is human.  That, and every other human in game gets a lot of screen time in item descriptions, dialogue, or interaction, yet there is none of that in regards to Rom, which would seem like a huge oversight.  What we do get are several references to the Bygenwyrth spider (Rom), who keeps the master (the great ones) away from it's seekers/pupils (the cultists).  A lot of people interpret that note to mean Rom keeps wilhem from his peeps, but I don't think that is the case.  Rom somehow cock-blocks or mutes the rituals the cultists are trying to create, hence, once you kill Rom, the blood moon or paleblood moon or whatever lights up the sky and the crazy people in Yahr Guhl finish their ritual to bring forth the one reborn and turn people to stone and other crazy shit.  This is further supported by the notes that say, "the spider keeps rituals from us," and other crazy shit like that.


The point is, people keep interpreting Micolash's vague madman speech to mean that Rom was granted a gift of many eyes by the great ones, but that is just one interpretation, never-mind the contradiction of, 'why would the great-ones help Rom in any way? specifically since he is obviously somehow blocking their rituals and blocking the cultists from contacting or bringing forth the other great ones?'  It's just as likely that Micolash just means, "make me as you made rom," like someone might say, "I wish I could fly, like the birds in the sky."  Worth noting, Micolash says the lake has turned to mud or whatever, which again, is reference to Rom somehow interfering with the other great ones and the cultists' rituals.  I've posted about Rom and Micolash and other relations in many related posts - might be worth looking at the other lore theories people have posted for sure. Either way, we still don't know the how's or the where's or the why's of Rom....and it all only brings up more questions. 




 I LOL'd way harder than I should have.  Also,I like it how you have zero bloodtinge :D 




 Yep.  I only fought the dude in NG+, so I can't speak of the NG cycle, but even in NG+, I could kill the sword in the ground with either one hit from my weapon, or even 1 shot from my +9 hunter's pistol (I only have like, 6 bloodtinge), so you don't even need a strong shot on it. 




 Well, it's not like rocks are all that common either, but there is a lot less gear to upgrade :D 




 I can confirm similar results.  With 250+ (slightly higher) discovery (2 eye runes+25 arcane stat) I found about 8-9 chunks in using exactly 15 BHM's (started with 45, but ended with 30), HOWEVER, I only killed the first 4 easy and quick to get to werewolves.  I never bothered with the 5th since he was up the stairs, down the hall, and out of the way :D 




 Haha.  I like how you over-simplified everything.  Shit gets crazy in-depth complex.  Just look up "lore" in this subreddit, or go youtube "davecontrollive" or "vaatividya" bloodborne youtube videos (they are some of the go to's when it comes to making money off youtube souls content, I mean, lore)  :) 




 Dead hookers.  First time I saw that fucker, I said to myself, *"I know the type."*  Those are with out a doubt, sacks of dead hookers.  Vaati already confirmed it bro. 




 Question is in the title. Thanks on advance for your replies.  




 By life-swallowing, I just mean those organizations that heavily indoctrinate you from an early age, from all angles, and that essentially try to run your life and be the central, most important facet of your existence.   And a follow up:  How did you come to find that it wasn't for you?  And how did you come to find your own identity in the world? 




 As the non-spoiler title doesn't say, What's through the locked door at the bottom (or middle) of the pit trough the door/lift in chapel ward that unlocks after you kill BSB?


I'm not talking about the door to the abandoned workshop. But IIRC there is a locked golden-ornate looking door (guarded by a werewolf iirc) either at the bottom of that pit, or maybe the middle section. Can anyone please tell me where that leads to? I accidentally beat the game and never got around to opening it up. Thanks. 

 




 Hey all.  I already accidentally beat the game in a no-spoiler/help run, so I am going through NG+ trying out all the optional stuff I missed or was barred from completing upon being booted to NG+, and with the tonsil stone/Amygdala, are there any immediate consequences for defeating that boss?  Will it change the progression in anyway, or bar me from completing other quest lines or cut off any other optional areas?  Also, since getting to the Amygdala puts you in Nightmare Frontier early, can you progress through that at all?  Or is it just a portion of it, and you have to follow the normal progression? Thanks in advance for your replies. 




 The chest right after father G in the study on the way to the Oedon Chapel had a kin cold blood in it. I swear it had a regular cold blood in it the first time round, because I think I would remember an item that gave me 20k souls at level 15, and the first time i saw a kin coldblood in my first play-trough was when i killed Ron the Grumpy Caterpillar. Can anyone else confirm or deny?  Or did you find anything to make you think otherwise?  Thanks in advance for your response.  




 U r all HIV bluud fagetz cuz u killt ravid siff!  wreckt 




 Mainly, what the fuck?  I somewhat fancy myself a pro when it comes to piecing together FROM lore, but even with playing part-time detective through Bloodborne, what the fuck just happened?


Also, super annoyed that it automatically kicked me to NG+. I didn't even get a chance to +10 a weapon  




 Loving how the game keeps getting weirder and weirder!  As odd as the fight seemed at first, I really loved the Ron the Angry Caterpillar encounter!  I kinda felt bad killing it though, since it started off just sitting there, minding it's own business like some kinda funky, own-business-minding, giant outer-space slug :/


And then the stuff that's coming after that... whoa!  I am thoroughly confused and confounded, though I have my conspiracy theories as to what species had sex with which to make all these vicious magic monsters!  All critiques aside, this is a fantastic game! 




 Be honest please.  I don't want to hear disclaimers, fluffy plattitudes, PC nonsense, or rationalizations and justification.  Just be honest, and feel free to be extra mean about it :)

edit:  derp ta terp 









 You know, that one guy, who is in the tower with the gatling gun who mows you down if you stop to lace up your corset?  Does he drop anything of consequence?  I ask, because, after dying to him stupidly a bunch, I accidentally killed him by kicking him out of the tower, and he fell to and died on the walkway below, but the item(s) he dropped were just floating in mid-air above the ground, impossible to pick up.  I tried reloading and dying, but the items just dissapeared.


Loving the game so far, but some of the little bugs like this, among the stuttering and frame loss has been a bummer.  Anyway, thanks in advance for your replies. 




 LOL Fagz amirite?  My beby alreadyy staurved to deth cuz I to buzy playin Bleedbourne Soulz to feed teh littul faget.  Stupid casul babee faget got WRECKT!1  I tuld it to git guud an now I use it as a doorsttop!

 









 This subreddit is awesome, I can't wait to participate, and I have a serious question here:  To go more in-depth than just the title, what if easy going, non-greedy Joe-Bloe has one reddit account, and posts once to get in on the drawing, and donates his part, while Joe-Bitch and Joe-Biznitch are friends, and together have 100 different reddit accounts each, and they can and will join the same drawing with 200 entries.  Is there anyway to weed this out?  I mean, never mind one person with multiple accounts, there could be multiple people pooling in, or any number of Joe-Biznitches out there.  


While I understand the necessity of paying as a donation rather than buying in, it's sort of a bummer to know that it can be so easily abused.  Never mind the possibility of someone using a bunch of accounts to enter the drawing, but there is a chance that they wouldn't even be donating their part to the actual winner anyway.  Not trying to be a bummer or anything, and I still plan on participating, but I was curious as to what everyone thought about it, or if there are any security measures in place to try to help weed out things like this?  Is it just one of those things that 'goes with the territory' of this premise and subreddit?  Thanks in advance for your replies.

 Hi all.  As the title said, I haven't really played much since the month of the last DLC (Ivory King), and I was wondering with all the news of the Sin of The First Flame and patches, if anything has really changed in game?  I don't mean the basics, like, katanas were buffed and lightning spears were nerfed again, but I'm just curious if they added any new areas or NPC's or more experience-changing elements like that.  Thanks in advance for your replies :) 




 And found it near completely lackluster, flat, and...boring?

 nbsp;

I mean, once upon a time it was great fun to me (haven't played it seriously/competitively since wrath) - and I was dissapointed to find it as seemingly dull as I have as of late.  I suppose my expectations and I have changed a bit over the years, but the fundamentals of WoW haven't.  That being said,  I remember it once seemed like a high point in PvP play for MMO's, but I'm thinking that I might be comparing it too much to all the games I've played since then.  


I mean, GW2 does large scale/siege combat much better, and is a little bit more action oriented, Rift did class trees/systems and basic combat better, Tera has more interactive and fun comat, EvE carries actual risks and rewards that will get your heart pumping, but WoW combat just feels so flat and dated.  I'm sure a lot of people still enjoy it, but I was just wondering what other's thought of it nowadays?  I was hoping to pick up WoW PvP like I used to in between hardcore raiding (now I play casuls lulz), but I jut couldn't do it, though I did appreciate the quick que times.   


At heart I still love WoW, and it will stay where it is for me: my de facto PvE game, as I still think WoW is the most consistent and best general PvE experience for MMO's.  At the least, it's the most polished and well-funded experience :)  Would love to hear other's thoughts.

Thanks in advance for your responses.  




 Hi all - as the title says, I just bought Witcher 2, and I have very little familiary with the plot and characters, and I was wondering if there are any must knows when it comes to the story or lore so that I won't miss too much of the 2nd game's plot?  Any recomended reading or videos before I start playing the second game?  Normally I'd be quick to play the first title in a series like this, but when the reviews say the combat/mechanics/etc are so much better and smoother in the second, it makes me want to skip the first, especially since the third is coming out right around the corner, and my gaming time is limited.  Furthermore, I ask because I don't want to risk stumbling across too many spoilers by accident, so I appreciate any directions you wticher fans may give.


Without reading too much on plot and setting, so far, the games and ideas in it sound awesome, and I was especially craving low-fantasy, dark-souls esque game play, and other than a few odd or similar titles, this seemed to fit the bill close enough.  The rest of the factions, political intrigue and backstabbery spookiness is just icing on the cake :)  Thanks in advance for your replies. 




 Hi all,


As the title says, is this game still live?  While I've never played DAOC, I've heard mostly good things over the years, and I ask because I was interested on joining to scratch my PvP itch.


That being said, how are the populations on live?  Does it require a sub?  I mean, I have no problems with a sub, but I was wondering what the differences were between live, and the emu servers?  How are the population on the emu servers?  Also, how are the populations on the emu servers?


A few more questions:  what are the different types of realms/shards on live?  Ie, PvP?  PvE?  Free for all?  That sort of thing?  How are they organized?  I've read that DAOC was 3 v 3 realm factions, but I was wondering how they further organized it.  Lastly, how does this game hold up compared to more modern games?  Is the UI/organization/etc. fairly smooth and intuitive?  I have no problem with old or aging graphics, but a clunky UI and lack of features will always be a big draw back.  Thanks in advance for your replies :) 




 Hi all.  I was watching game-play footage and reading up on Albion Online, and seeing the game made me crave some similar sort of play - that is, some sort of pvp/crafting focused exploration open world fun.  The closest game recommendation I could find in searches for similar, yet already released titles was UO.  I've known about UO a long time, I've just never played it, as back in the day I wound up on EQ, and never tried UO.


That being said, for all you UO fans out there, care to give me a brief run-down of the game?  Some must-know tips for newbs maybe?  Any in-game recommendations or hints?  In the mean-time I've been reading up on wikis and websites, but I always enjoy talking to established fans and players.


Thanks in advance for your replies :)

 




 For those of you who have been following the game and/or playing in the alpha, can anyone deny or confirm if this statement is accurate or not?  Of course I don't mean that I expect it to be exactly the same as EVE, but what about a fairly close approximation?

I mean - from equipment slots being filled with abilities just like mod slots give you abilities in Eve, to the devs trying to control RMT, to the 'you are your equipment' (in eve, your ship=you), to the security statuses of green, yellow, and red, to controlling territory, to losing your gear on death, it all seems pretty similar.

So far from what I've read and looked up, it seems like an awesome idea, and I'm sort of excited, but at the same time, it is also sort of horrifying.  If let's say, resource collecting is as boring as it is in EVE with mining (target rocks, turn on lasers, move, ship, store, compress, bring haulers, etc) or needing to multi/cheat box 16 accounts to truly get anywhere, then it loses a lot of its appeal.  Or let's say with grouping and fleets, if combat is as simple as being an F1 monkey like it is in EVE medium to large fleets (ie, you target who you're supposed to, turn on damage, and that's the fight), or any other number of quirks like that, it just seems like it would be boring, redundant, and, uh... not fun?


I mean, I've been playing EVE for a long time, but I mostly play to spend time with my brothers.  We only do PVP in a large null-sec alliance.  But even with the focus being combat, honestly, I don't feel like I'm playing a game with EVE - I feel like I'm tooling around and manipulating old, simple mechanics that resemble a game.  Ie, I feel like I'm just playing with the bones of a game, not the actual flesh and blood of it.  I enjoy it, to a point, but also, even with blowing up big spaceships and ruining many people's days, it's still kinda boring.


Anyway, those are my ruminations.  Just wondering what people think so far.  Thanks in advance for your time and responses. 




 Hi all - As the title says says, do you get the resources you used building buildings back in any way shape or form when you remove or replace them in your garrison?  I googled it in various ways but never found a straight answer.  Thanks in advance for your response. 




 Hi all.

As the title of the post says, I have questions on armor. Specifically, I know equipping an armor set is based on secondary stats, but is there a quick way to tell how much of your stats an armor piece uses?


I was taking armor pieces on and off while looking at the stat sheet and I noticed the stats going up and down, but is there an easier way to keep track of it?  Or a way to hell how many stats total a piece of armor or full set uses?


Also, aside doctor buffs, are there other ways to increase those secondary stats?  What about the reallocation (or whatever its called) option?  How does that work?


As far as HAM goes, I noticed things die when one of the 3 bars runs out, so does that essentially mean you're only as good as your weakest ham bar?  And with the different consumption levels of HAM from abilities, and enemies doing damage to different bars, is there an easy way to track this?  I noticed my abilities seem to drain different HAM numbers on enemie - does that occur based on the weapon I use or from the abilities themselves?  (Ie., basic attack or overshot with a rifle, or regular attack and 2h lunge attack with a heavy axe)


right now a lot of this stuff seems pretty arbitrary and nonsensical to me, so any clarity would be appreciated. Thanks in advance for your replies :) 




 Hi all.

Whether or not you played the original Warhammer Online Age of Reckoning (which closed down in 2013), I'm curious if anyone here has played or plays on the private server?


http://www.returnofreckoning.com/about.php

I never had a chance to play the original game, but I plan on registering/setting it up the emu soon, and I was just wondering if anyone had some opinions or tips or ideas to offer up on the private server.  Specifically, how is balance between the two factions?  How is the game play in general?  That sort of thing.  As it stands, I know they are still ironing it out quite a bit and working on bugs and stuff, but so it goes for private servers.  Thanks in advance for your replies 




 Hello all,

I've just reinstalled MW4 Mercs on my newer Win 8.1 machine, and just like my old machine on windows 7, it's been working great.  

The only problem is in the title of this post - any changes I make in the MW4 config ap don't seem to save.  Does anyone have any suggestions or know a fix for this?  Thanks in advance for your replies. 




 Seriously.  I don't know what it is about this game that sees that a good portion of the time your retarded pickup group loses terribly back to back, but I can't take much more of this (some things have not changed since beta).  In short I'm looking for people who are at least as competent as a pickle or a jar of mayonnaise, who are looking for other players to group with.  I'm on Pacific Standard time (CA, USA). 

Drop me a line here on Reddit or in game.  My IGN is Balcombe. 




 Ok - not to repeat what anyone else has said because I've searched it many times over, but is this UI really what were left with?  I mean, it seems so piss-poor that it's hard to believe, so please understand tht I make this thread just to make sure I'm not missing anything:

So I log in last night for the first time in a year, and I didn't even get a chance to play because I spent about 2-3 stupid OCD hours after a years worth of patching sorting trough mechs, trying to find parts, figuring the terrible UI out until I stripped all my mechs, called it a night, and went to bed. 


Now. I've tried a buncha searches to see if there was a fix or if I broke something, but it seems this new UI was put out nearly a year ago, and almost immediately the MWO forum blew up with players talking about how terrible it was to use and how it made te gaming experience a shit-show. Anyway. That was a lot of complaints from a lot of people almost a year ago, and it's still there?  So that means some dip-shit at PGI saw all that, experienced what a piece of crap the UI was, and somehow said, "it's acceptable. Working as intended."


I mean, I ask because, WTF?  I checked the patch notes today, stupidly thinking it would say the UI is fixed, but I guess to them there is nothing to fix?  Thanks in advance for your replies.  




 Anyone know of good current or in-development games that are what MWO should have been?  I play Hawken here and there as a sort of filler for FPS meeting mech action, but that is more FPS/twitch based, and it lacks the ideal of a mech game:  
the mechlab/strategybrawling and twitch combat (though the brawling should fill its niche in there somewhere).  I looked into perpetum, both good and bad reviews, and it is too reminiscent of Eve, which I already play, and I refuse to try to get into another game like that.  Eve can be brutal and time consuming enough.  Essentially, I want to play MWO, just not the MWO that has been derped and rederped.  Anyone have any suggestions?  Anything with a solid mech/lab, decent options for builds and chassis, etc, that doesn't gate so much of the piddly amount of new content for absurd real money prices?  I mean, cash-shops are fine, but not how MWO has done it:  how many hundreds of dollars do they want to keep asking for a sub-par game before the diehard battletech fans kick in their monitors and quit the game?


I don't say these things to continue what I see as a fairly justified bitch-fest about the state of MWO, but from the bigger picture, that MWO is that crack-baby that was dropped on its head too many times and wound up in foster care and the only people willing to adopt it also abuse it.  Us long-time fans want to love it, but it's lacking in so many ways, and in the mean time PGI is golding the IP hostage, never mind the fact that us founders got screwed, the dev process has been clunky and slow, and PGI has more than bled the community dry in constant, shameless, bull-shit cash-grabs, and continues to do so.


Anyway - I say all this to give you an idea of the game I'm looking to play.  I don't mind in game cash-shops, so long as it doesn't gate content, specifically when that content is minimal.  A little bit of pay to sparkle or even p2w is fine.  I'd prefer a nice mix of strategy and twitch, and I'd prefer there be giant, powerful, robots smashing each other into oblivion.  Bonus points if the robots actually take skill, patience, and attention to drive.

Cheers, and thanks in advance for your responses. 




 As the title says, for crystal use purposes, what are BAMs considered?  Boss monsters or regular monsters?


That being said, does anyone have a good, up-to-date guide for leveling up via mob grinding?  I google searched it, but a lot of the information I'm finding seems out of date or changed.  If anyone could provide a link or put up a quick list of optimum mobs/locations to grind, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks in advance for your replies. 




 Hi all.  I just started playing the game and I am thoroughly enjoying my first few hours.

I'm writing this post to see if there is anyone available to join me.  I started a warrior (named Heavy.Meddles) and a sorcerer (Balcombe), and I'm having a hell of a time trying to decide which one to main because they are both fun to play so far.

Drop me a line here or in game if you'd like to level/group with me.

Thanks. 




 Hi Everybody,

As the title says, I haven't played since 2011 or so, and I was just wondering what some of the major changes were, as I have been looking at playing the game some more.  When I left the game, my main was a level 50ish (I don't remember exactly) magician (or whatever they are called), as well as a mid level assassin and warrior (or whatever they were called).

And yes, while I have been looking/googling this stuff a little bit at a time, I also figured why not ask the friendly reddit people for a more concise answer, especially to a few specific questions:

1.  I left a little while after they released the kromede/judge and lower level solo missions.  What are the major game/class/etc changes since then?

2.  PvP was fun - the abyss being one of the primary hunting grounds - are the PvP battles still hearty and large scale and super laggy?  Also, being that it is a korean MMO - while the PvP gear was good, it was also an insane grind (just like the PvE gear) to get any of it.  Is this still the case?  I mean, I don't need or want gear to be handed to me, but korean farm-style playing is madness!  Has this changed for the better?

3.  Is the game still PvP centric in general?  What are the primary servers, and how is the balance on them?

4.  Offhand, I can't remember if you paid straight kinah to reskin items, or if you just bought a consumable.  How is reskinning/wardrobe handled nowadays?

5.  How about the Classes/Professions or whatever they are called?  Any one care to give me a quick run down?  Ie, "PvP is dominated by so-and-so, so-and-so massive DPS OP, so-and-so massive under powered, so-and-so is a joke, etc"

6.  How is the economy?  As usual, I remember this MMO being dominated by gold-sellers and bots, everything was super pricey, and kinah was slow to grind, making everything a PITA.  Has this changed for the better?  Is it more stable?  Still bot dominated?  Etc?

Thanks in advance for your replies.

 Hi.  As the title says, PC, top tier SM bracket in NG+ looking to trade my rampart golem armor/helm for a pair of rampart golem gloves.  Will be around for a few hours tonight, and maybe tomorrow night.  Drop me a line if you're interested.  Thank you.

P.S. - I tired posting this in r/wheelanddeal but I kept getting error messages 




 This conversation came up within a post of this subreddit, so I wanted to ask the DS community at large what their suggestions are when it comes to finding other games that are challenging and intriguing enough to play through, ie., games that raise the bar like the Souls series, or at least, games that don't feel too easy or stale, especially when compared to the Souls franchise.  While I know this isn't directly DaS2 per se, I feel it is in good taste, and could help other people find new and fun games to play as well.  I'm a PC gamer, but I do plan on getting a PS4 in the months to come for Bloodborne, but any system suggestions are welcome, as other people can benefit.


Point is, while there are many fun games out there, few have the risk and reward factors, immersion, compelling and mysterious stories, lore, and fun gameplay wrapped together as well as the Souls series does.  I'm not necessarily looking for Souls clones, or games that are even in the same fantasy genre or share similar combat systems, but just other well balanced, challenging games.  Worth noting, other than saying DaS2 is a better RPG game, but DaS is a better Souls game, I'm leaving out critique on DaS and DaS2 for this post, mainly focusing on what makes them fun and challenging games.


While I'm open to any game, regardless of reviews and opinions, to help narrow it down, I can add a few critiques or reviews of other noteworthy games and series:


Morrowwind, Oblivion, Skyrim, that series:  Fun, to a point, often redundant, repetitive, weaker combat/magic systems, worth their dollar value in entertainment, but the stories and characters were never compelling enough that I ever finished a single game, even after logging 60-100+ hours on some.


MMO's:  Honestly, most of them have terrible writing, bad stories, stale gameplay, and very few innovations.  They often lack any weight, and feel like button mashing with little to no immersion.  Thus they wind up repetitive grinds, even if some of the character, boss, and level design is well rendered.  The treadmill just gets old, and this comes from an old Ultima/EQ/WoW (played WC since WC1, had to know what happened in the story, etc.


Legend of Grimrock:  Right up my alley.  I love old-school dungeon crawlers - for the challenges in puzzles and combat, the change of pace, as well as nostalgia.  Graphics aint everything.  I have been members of Dungeon Master/Chaos Strikes Back/related games and clones communities, and have many user-made dungeons and other emulators and remakes for these types of games.


Dead Space:  Overall, this is my favorite shooter/survivor horror game in recent years.  Great story, great characters, lots of twists and turns, well-written, scary and immersive, and somewhat innovative, or at least, had some noteworthy differences.  Loved that your character was a crafty engineer rather than a soldier.  You used mining tools for weapons!  Was great!


Dragon Age Origins:  Was a great game at the time.  Was definitely immersive, as the characters were cheeky and well-written, the voice acting was good, and the world had some great lore, even if the tropes are old as writing itself.  Looking back, the combat was kinda meh, if somewhat strategic at times, and the levels seem pretty small and thus the game limited, but still a memorable game.  I never bothered with the second, as I was bored within a minute of the demo.


Mass Effect:  While I enjoyed the first and second, by the time I got to the third just this last month or two (yeah, I was late to the party), I dunno, the game just felt stale and limited and so easy, even on the highest difficulties.  The levels and areas to explore just seemed so simple and rehearsed, and at times it just feels like the AI/system is playing the game for me.  While the series was intriguing enough for the first two games, after being ruined by the souls series, now it just seems boring and redundant.



Anyway, all that being said, I'm up for all and any suggestions, preferably with the elements of good writing, fun/challenging gameplay, immersion, and better risk/reward systems.  Saving and reloading constantly definitely diminishes this, but I look forward to what you guys have to say.  Thanks in advance. 




 Hello everyone.  While I know there have already been speculative posts on this reddit about the title question, can anyone confirm or deny if any of the higher-ups at Sony/From/Miyazaki/etc. have either confirmed, denied or even given a maybe on whether or not there will be a Bloodborne bundle?  I've searched the web, but no dice so far.



I ask because, if so, I would like to wait for the bundle, rather than pre-ordering the deluxe edition Bloodborne early, as well as a PS4 separately.  Thanks in advance for your replies. 




 Well, if I had to title this story, it would be, "Guess how many times I died during the tutorial?"  Psshaw, none at all.  That would be pathetic, amirite, or amirite!?

So what started out as a perfect no death chievo run for the first three minutes ended abruptly in Things Betwixt when I derped off the edge of a cliff.  I said, "you know what death, not today."  I then died 2 minutes later when I missed a plunging attack and took an arrow in the ass.  After being defeated by the tutorial, I headed on my to Majula, to ya know, kick rocks and mope around with the rest of the bipolar twits.

After losing my left testicle to one of the piglets, I went forth to brave the forest of the fallen giants.  At this point, my girlfriend started talking at me.  I love her to death, but man she can talk.  I nodded, and I said "uh huh, uh huh, yeah" and then I died.  She kept talking.  And then I died again.  Then I realized I love her, but I don't love her to death, and I got mad at her, and I told her, "not now, you can fill my ear holes with words later!," and that's when she got mad at me, so I took a break from the game to grovel and kiss her ass and apologize.  I told her to stay away from me for the next week or two as I would be very angry.  Very, very angry.  Lots of cursing to ensue....


Ahem, so, anyway, I resume braving the forest of fallen giants with a crossbow in my left hand, a mace in my right hand, and an imported sack over my head to hide my hollowed shame.  I die a few more times  whilst slapping around various zombies and meth addicts, and finally I make it to the last giant.  Speaking of which, did you ever think what a liar he is?  There are quite a few more giants in Black Gulch, and they exist in memories at the least, so fuck you Last Giant, you lying liar.  What else are you lying about?!  Ehrm, anyway, I take him down on the first go, and he died like a punk with no integrity what so ever.  Having a surplus of souls I buy a zillion wooden bolts to slay hookers and vampires from a distance, and with my spirits renewed, I zip over to Heide's tower to go toe to toe with the dragon rider.  I run past all the enemies and bum rush the fog gate.  I was going to duke it with him like a man, cuz I'm a man like that - always working on cars and bench-pressing saber-tooth tigers like a man, but somehow, mysteriously, by no plan of my own, the dragon rider took exactly six steps forward and raised his mighty halberd at me.  I'm no fool, so I dodge right as he lunges forward, and whaddayaknow, the clumsy bastard fell off the edge of the arena and died like a derp!  I was going to raise the edges of the platform so we could spar, but I, uh, just forgot.  Anyway, that is where I paused my adventure so far.  Tonight I plan on going back for fake Ornstein, because ya know, I hate liars.  One more baddie to die in poverty and shame!  I got your number fake Ornstein!


Anyway, after working on various DaS level 1 runs, I gotta say, while easier so far in some ways than DaS 1Broing, the worst of it has been learning the sweet spot on the pitiful dodge roll.  Even at well under 50%, there are like what, negative two i-frames?  I swear, compared to the fast roll of DaS, or the ninja-WTF-flipping, I feel like an obese shut-in with no cartridge in his knees.  Learning to dodge as such has a much steeper curve - especially since my onebro seems to purposefully roll into every arrow that is shot at him.


That being said, stay tuned for more adventures of a DS2 OneBro!   




 After taking a break from Dark Souls 2 I returned to Dark Souls and created a Paladin character. 

I found myself in Anor Londo, stuck at the infamous silver knight archer gauntlet, and while I've had melee characters have little trouble with that part before, for some reason, I just couldn't get past it.  I prolly lost 50k souls total and lots of humanity at this point,  and after dying countless times (like 12 times, but I can't count that high), I die another 5 times, and finally, on like, the 20th try, I dash up that small span one final time, and there in the middle of it is a black vagabond!

I panic because I've never seen one, and I wanna know what's inside it, but I also know I'm in the worst position ever.  He shoots a homing soul mass type projectile right over me, and by the time I realize, "hey, it's the most rare enemy in the game, i wanna kill it for lootz!" and try to swing my sword, he swings his pincer and one shots me, and a second later the dragon arrows start  raining down on my body.  That was the first and only time I've seen a black vagabond to date.  I think I remember seeing a red one, but that was a year or two ago.

Anyway.  At that point, after dying 1,745 times at that spot, and finally to the black vagabond, my hatred turned to laughter, and after briefly contemplating suicide, I finally got past the silver knights.  Sadly, I have yet to see that little black bastard since then.

With that story out of the way, what is your most memorable death?  Also, has anyone killed a black vagabond?  If so, what did it drop?  With how bad-ass they are, it's gotta be the cure for cancer, or an autographed picture of Jesus!  What say you?

-One of the best Simpsons quotes ever, 




 You're welcome on the info thing.

Well, neither of those games play like bloodborne, and most games don't in either style, mechanics, or lore and story-telling, but they have their similarities and are quite different.  Dead Space 1 and 2 are solid survival horror games.  They follow mysterious plotlines that you have to fit together and are slowly revealed, yet even then mysterious, leaving you with many questions.  Also, the game-play is similar to Dark Souls in that it is a bit more slow and plodding and thoughtful, and it can be challenging, especially on higher difficulties, though it is standard load/save type method of doing things.


Darkest dungeon is a RNG party-based dungeon crawling game, where you recruit characters who die permanent deaths, focus on party comps and smart item usage and upgrades of your town hub, characters and armor, and it is pretty similar to the Cthulu mythos of crazed cults and mysterious dark portals and Eldritch truth.


A few others are Salt and Sanctuary - an upcoming 2d souls type game yet to be released, and Lords of The Fallen is a similar DaS style game (die and leavebloodstains, lose all your currency, focus on builds and weighty combat) was released last fall, and even though it isn't anywhere as good as DaS/BB, it is still one of the only directly DaS inspired games out there.  And of course, there are the Original Souls - Demon Souls, DaS and Das2, all worth playing, even though they are similar yet quite different from Bloodborne.


Edit:  Some other good 2D souls like games (death has consequences, risk vs reward, etc) are Rogue Legacy and Shovel Knight. 




 Right, but it depends on weapon scaling and stat investments as well, and the point remains, that there is only one in main game play through, and it sucks having to run hours of chalice dungeons or run to a whole new playthrough if you don't pick it up. 




 Takes a lot of patience - you can't get greedy or you will be killed in one shot.  I stayed at range, baiting out his charge attack (turns into a leap later on, so it changes the timing of when you have to dodge), which is easy to dodge once you know the tells and the timing, or his vomit (which he hardly ever did for me ). 


 If he vomits, and you can get to him quickly, whack his legs 3 times, and it will stun him for a moment, but make sure you don't get too greedy.


When he charges, dodge to the right and behind him, and either do one running or quick attack, and back away/dodge again, as he will quickly retaliate.  With the axe (what I think I was using), I could only get off one attack or risk being killed.


I've fought him in his weaker versions more head on which was easy, but that is the strategy I used to beat him, as I wasn't doing so hot facing him head on, as a lot of times he would charge at me even if I was close to him, and I hardly had the time or room to dodge, and it just complicated the fight too much for me, though in his last phase he hardly would want to charge me at all, so I did some very hesitant, scared shitless face-to-face combat, but I wasn't happy about it :D 




 Dude.  That shit totally reminds me of full-metal alechemist and the creation of a philosopher's stone.  All you need is a large number of hapless, terrifies souls to complete the ritual create it :D


Edit:  And the other ones who didn't get turned to stone were turned into giant lumpy, human flesh-ipedes! 




 Nope.  I don't like the blunderbuss or the cane, but the pistol is awesome and easy to parry with.  Maybe you should mix up your weapon useage and play style?  As much as I enjoy(ed) the plodding, strategic combat of DaS, I definitely think FROM did right with a change, and I find BB infinitely more fun, fluid, intense, and enjoyable when it comes to combat mechanics.  I love DaS, but BB has been a step in the right direction in terms of actual gameplay, though of course it could use more weapons and armor and etc. 




 I'm gonna be sure to leave notes in front of all the dolls and ladders now :D 




 I try to update my cloud save files like, every other day, especially if I make a lot of progress.  Don't know if PS4 automatically does this by default.  Can anyone confirm?  Either way, definately worth doing it manually every now and again to be sure, and also back it up on a USB drive maybe once every few weeks or once a month, that way, you're never totally screwed. 




 There is one blood rock you can get in the main game, and I suggest you get it before you kill gherman and get booted to NG+, as then you will miss out on it, and they are very hard to come by.  NG+ doubles everyone's hp, so a +10 weapon can definitely help you feel like you are fighting with something more than a limp bread stick :D 




 Cool, glad you took that as I intended it to be read, even though I perhaps sounded a bit dick-ish at parts.  Definately.  I liked how you bowed in the first match, even in the midst of his onslaught (also annoying that you can't cancel emotes as quickly in this game), and then you proceeded to beat him in a close match.  And cheers to older etiquete, I just find it amusing when people get mad that people don't act as they insist.  Wish this game had something more implied like red sign soap stones and arenas :/ 




 Ehh, Squid headed Cthulu-esque monsters are always a visiual cue, but often it involves eldritch (sinister/ghostly) type of truths that induce madness, and that somehow bring to light the limitations of humanity and our perceptions and understanding.  Two come readily to mind:


A newer game called Darkest Dungeon on Steam (awesome by the way, and brutal like souls/BB) is heavily influenced by Lovecraft.  Hell, even a game like deadspace (all about evolution, taking humanity to the next level based on this "alien" artifact that induces a madness that believers see as truth and growth) is very Lovecraftian, even though there aren't squid-headed monsters in it. 




 Dude, you don't even want to know it!  The Eldritch Truth will drive you mad!  MAD I SAY!!!!1! 




 Not passive aggressive, I just wanted to crush his moment of triumph and  give him a heads up that it only gets worse :) 




 Yeah - a lot of Lovecraft's focus was psychological, that is, fear of the unknown, and the limitations of human comprehension, hence so much of the focus of the game is about insight, and understanding the sinister truth and perception.  Ie., can you think of a five-sided triangle?  Or absolute zero, or nothingness?  Such things might exist, but they are truly beyond us being our comprehension. 




 You do know that's not the blood letting beast that everyone has the hardest time with, right?  :P


Nice work though! 




 Dude got wreckt, and that's cool, but why would yo ube so solipsistic in the first place?  Does everyone have to play by your rules or even the community's rules either in a game, or outside in the real world?  That shit can get you killed there too :D  Also, there's something to appreciate in how that dude just ran at you all aggressive as fuck, just like the hunter NPCs, no bull-shitting around.  None of the other hostile hunters in the game stop to bow and have tea and crumpets with you bdefore starting a fight, so why should he?


Have done lots of PvP in souls games, and honestly, who gives a shit about it in BB?  It's not like we placed down red or black soap stone signs to duel, and it's not like it's hard to inflict damage. Fighting is so fast-paced, and there are so many items and weapons to utilize for fun, that both people can use, why try and put the same honor code here?  With how long it can take to even get matches, I appreciate the longer and more drawn-out fights, so long as the invaders aren't hiding in a group of NPCs, or totally shitting on both of our time in one way or another.  Don't mean to sound like a dick, but I'm sick of people complaining about this shit or other arbitrary PvP rules, especially since BB is not the same as the Souls games, and it's the perfect game to play a sleaze ball, and use all the dirty tricks in the book, and to have fun with some intense fights, and I think putting restrictions on such a game are just limiting the full experience of the PvP  :D 




 Would it upset you if I told you I killed this guy on my level 4 beastbro run?  That poison is no joke with low vitality :D  Here are some tips.


You can parry him (when he extends his arm all the way back, pretty much as he is just shooting it forward, pow, parry+visceral.)


Save a firepaper, and your oil urns and molotov cocktails for the last phase so you can stay away from the poison, and kill him ASAP.


As others have said, if you stay to his right side, locked on, always ready to dodge, he will never hit you, but again, that poison can be brutal in that last phase.

 




 Don't they aren't definitely afraid of anything? 




 PSA:  You can use the beast claw to deflect objects, including fireballs, bullets, and even the giant rocks those fuckers throw.  You can thank me later :D 




 Plz make a bloodborne movie Disney!  PLZ! 




 Eh, but same thing goes for the rest of the souls games as well.  See Onebros :D 




 Was about to say, if you kill Rom before Amelia, it can bug out your game... 




 I know right?  Dude should get a room if he is gonna be spamming his bone, then he has the nerve to come at you before he even washes his hands?!  What an asshole! 




 Yeah, but the axe does group damage and crowd constrol so much better and easier, and somehow it's even quicker and more versatile.  You think they would have made the whip at least a bit quicker :/ 




 So what if you have deft little delicate hotdogs for fingers?  How do you have the strength to punch your hand trough a pig's ass and rip out its intestines?! 




 Can you confirm that guide/dlc thing? 




 That sounds like a fun fight.  I actually was sort of miffed by hemwick my first time through.  I mean, it was super easy, but it was sort of quiet and I didn't know what the fuck was goin on, in an anti-climactic sort of way.  Then I realized there was a little barnacle covered toad lady you had to whack, then another one, then she was dead and it was easy and I was like, how does this shit fit into the story?  0_o 




 Hahahaha.  Thanks for sharing. 




 I totally enjoy onebro runs or limited items/weapons and other challenge runs, but the tedium and insanity of barehanded and guitar hero controllers just sounds maddening!  I can already feel the frenzy meter rising just thinking about it, feeling a bit sick, but at least I can die human.... rooooAAARRr scREEEACH BLARRRRGHHHeeEeeeeRRRRRRRR RAOOOR! 




 And all those heavy trade-offs are why it's obnoxious that people even bitch and moan about in-game mechanics, items, and weapons that are clearly meant to be used, especially in PvP :D 




 Yeah, how dare people use in game items and weapons and intended mechanics.  From here on out, you are not allowed to use the rally system either!  Rally system is total CHEEZ mode!!1! 




 I'd defeat him with the sprint button :P

Last time I bothered to kill one of those assholes as a regular dungeon mob, he only dropped a bent paper-clip or something stupid like that :/ 




 Is there a cannon armed undead giant surrounded by dogs and undead with a bellmaiden nearby dropping spiders on your face?  That one has been, my, uh, favorite one so far... 




 I wear it with the crowfeather garb, as the black feathers on the bone ash set better matches the crowfeather jacket.  Looks pretty sick.  The whole vibe is a nice angel of death one :D 




 Also a heads up - make sure you run it blind with no spoilers/help/etc., as, yes, the level design is awesome, but it also hides how short and straight-forward the game truly is :/ 




 Goddammit lock ness monstah, I dun told you I aint givin you no tree'fiddy! 




 Eh, say what you will, but Dark Souls 2 was still the best game of 2014, and still gave FROM fans a bajillion hours of entertainment for both PvE and PvP, and still had the best fashion souls and PvP to date of the whole series.  BB would be closer, if not for the lousy match-making and load times and lack of multi-player options and covenants. 




 What you're describing is Dead Space, almost :D 




 U stoopid newb got reckt!

Just kidding :D

Yeah, if only we did something more useful with some of our spare time...man, the amount of souls knowledge and trivia up there is the reason I can't remember people's names anymore :) 




 That wasn't just you.  That was everyone.  DaS PvP was an economy of backstabs, and a lot of lag :D 




 There are covenants in this game?  :D 




 Being human itself allowed summons, bonfire kindling, etc, and also raised your resistances, and the humanity stat itself also increased your item discovery, aside the other affects of AR for certain weapons of ETC.


Point is, I had that thought as well (about insight doing more or being linked to idiscovery), but it would need a better balance.  In general, insight needs more of a purpose in game... 




 And then you join scientology, and they take all your echoes in tax-deductible donations, and the brain-sucker slurps out all your intelligence and free will!  Totally spot on! 




 dON'T GIVE UP SKELETON! 




 Well, I like the idea, and it would balance out since not everyone levels arcane (and honestly, the wizard stuff equivelant in this game is kinda lame anyhow, even for some extra utility and damage), but it would need to be balanced more though - like how in DaS1, your humanity raised your Idiscovery, but you risked losing it if you died... 




 Yeah, my level 4 beastbro is kickin ass and he's half way through the main game, and its pretty much like playing the whole game ond defiled cursed chalice dungeon mode, since a lot of late game enemies and most bosses kill you in one or two hits.  My main who I just like to derp around with is around level 200 or so, so who knows why the fuck he sounds so self-righteous and upset.  What else is my main supposed to do after easily aquiring all items?  Just sit on top of 2 million souls?  Nah, spend that shit.  


The most important part of a build is focus, and then the skill to use it, and a few extra levels (even 50 of them) hardly make a difference.  Anything past a level 100-120 specialized build doesn't necessarily make the game any easier anyhow, as most Bosses can still kill you in one or two hits, and the small damage bonuses are negligible, especially since an extra 10% damage doesn't mean much on a swing, when an enemy will still take two whole swings to kill anyhow. 




 Yeah, at depth 5 chalices and NG++, I find my main wandering around with a million souls fairly easily, so I've just been pumping his levels up.  Almost level 200 on him.


I have a level 4 beastbro who I will never level, and I'm also working on two separate builds I'll keep in co-op and pvp ranges.


Edit:  Also, with how wonky multiplayer is, and how tough certain chalices are, I can safely say I miss soul memory  :P 




 And the rent is too damn high!  Wait, what...? 




 Dude.  I tried the cane last night on a new character, and I got my ass handed to me over and over again at beginning of the game, and I'm in NG++ on other toons, have beaten all the lowest depth chalices, and I even am working on a Onebro challenge run.  Sure, I don't know how to play as effectively with the cane yet, but even then, the weapon just seems so lacking, namely in whip mode.  My level 4 beastbro kicks far more ass with a hunter's axe than my canebro, and onebro is in the forbidden forest, fighting much tougher enemies.  Cane just seems so whimpy, slow, and lacks damage on its whip attacks, as they have a ridiculously long wind up time, yet don't do as much damage as the kick-ass hunter's axe halberd version, nor do they stun as easily it seems.  Am I missing something here?  Or does the cane sort of suck, namely compared to other weapons that do both 1h and 2h modes better in general? 




 Right, and this is all the more reason why they need to focus and fix those issues sooner rather than later, and we know their is a match coming on the 23rd, though I don't know if that is the announced one to supposedly optimize multi-player.  I agree with a lot of your other ideas, but game balances like that can be tweaked later, after we're done yelling "Rabble rabble rabble!" about the critical-mass multi-player problems  :D


You made a good write up though.


Edit:  Also, 2nd most important, is we need covenants that matter, covenants that carry some fun interaction, risks, and rewards.  As it stands, covenants are lame as fuck and pointless in this game :( 




 I love this game, 9/10 rating from me, but there are a few huge problems in it at the moment, and they are brutally critical for a FROM game, and they definitely threaten the longevity and replayability of Bloodborne.  The biggest problems imo at the moment are the invasion system/mechanics, lack of covenants and covenant interactions/rewards, lack of even duels or an arena type system, and the wonky, undependable multi-player system in general.

Invasions - This game needs more invasions, in more areas, even if the boss is dead.  This game was not as exciting as previous titles, as there was far less risk due to a lack of player invaders.  I think bell maidens should spawn in pretty much almost every area of the game, and they should also still spawn after the boss is dead.  *I'm not even a fan of invading or invaders, but I still enjoy the mechanic, because it creates even more of a threat, and adds another delicious layer of fear, precaution, and excitement.*  I myself much prefer soapstones for dueling and arenas, and on that note:


There needs to be better, non-penalized dueling systems (ie, no -30% health penalty).  There should be bells for even-matched duels and fight clubs, as well as an arena system implemented.



Multi-player in general needs to be better, faster connections, less time-outs, and insight should not be consumed until a match is found and you are actually placed in another's player world.


There needs to be covenants in this game, along with all the risks and rewards of being in them.  Oh, there are covenants in this game?  You could have fooled me!  :D


Those are my biggest gripes for now, never mind any of the other critiques.  Still give the game a 9/10 because it is a fantastic game, but the issues that are there for the moment are very fucking glaring and unforgivable in a game like this.  I almost want to say, FROM could have or should have known and done better :(



Edit:  And yes I agree - frenzy is a goofy ass mechanic that needs some tweaking.  Bleed was cool and functional in DaS, negligble and useless in DaS2, and the equivelant in BB is just OP and WTF and kind of stupid...

 




 I don't know why a bunch of random assholes are downvoting you for no apparent reason, but you're right, it's definitely more fun than a heart attack, but not as fun as say, an aneurysm  :D 




 Create a level 4 beastbro for a challenge run?  Or some other type of chalice run?  That's the only other thing at the moment, other than what you mentioned and playing more NG cycles...  or, maybe trying new builds, or something besides quality/ludwig's.


That being said, hopefully they patch multiplayer soon...


other than what you mentionedLevel than what you mentioned and NG cycles and more chalice dungeons... 




 Yeah.  I think that's a pretty dumb way of calculating damage for viscerals... 




 How would you redo the character?  I mean, don't get me wrong. To really go for it ya really gotta use everything in your arsenal, and sometimes it's the environment, so no biggie there.  




 No summons for a true beastbro run for some, but the true deciding factor is not leveling. I managed to get Amelia on my second go, but I burned up my last 3 fire papers and used a few molotovs as well, as well as 10-15 blood vials. I'm currently getting destroyed in forbidden woods. The dogs just fart in my direction and my HP melts. Just lost 70k souls too, which is a lot. After amelia though, id recomend going to cainhurst ASAP to get blood chunks. You can at least get your weapon up to +7 or 8 if you're lucky. 


That being said, if you're around to night, I'd be willing to help u with Amelia in true Beastbro fashion, that way some higher level isn't doing the wimping for you. Let me know.  




 Yo dawg, I heard you like dreams, so we put dreams in a dream, so you could dream that your dreaming while you're dreaming about dreaming. 




 You cheesed him behind the graves and objects though :|


If we're bragging here, I beat him in one go on my first attempt with my level 4 Beastbro.  No, it was not gracious, as I had to do a lot of running and dodging in the last phase, but yes - most of his attacks will still kill you in a one to three hits with a level 4 at 10 vitality too, but don't worry, all enemies and bosses will be killing you with one shot later on in the game. 




 Welcome to Camera Souls, where the most difficult enemy you will ever fight is the camera, and he follows you into every boss battle!


(Seriously though, the camera has always been an issue in these games) 




 So this was right before he beat you to a bloody pulp with his sack of dead hookers, huh? 




 Uh, I thought Yharnam sprang up on top of the labrynth - as a result of blood healing and the further experiments with the splits in the school of thoughts from Byrgenwyrth?  Ie., Yharnam came to exist and thrive because of the blood, rather than being incidentally infected with it?
 




 Dude, after several playthroughs with a dozen other toons, for whatever reason, my mage could not make it up that one arch with the two silver archers shooting him for the life of me!  And the last time I tried, a fucking black vagrant spawned right in the middle of the arch, blocking the path, and it proceeded to 1-shot me!  Good times! 




 Well, I think the weapons they do have are pretty great, and I'd take one or two unique weapons over a whole table of 20 axes that are virtually the same (aside fashion, of course), but still, give us a few more chunks and/or rocks in each play through or whatever so we can at least play around more with the few weapons that are there :D 




 Dude.  She plays it like she's one tough crow, but really she is a super sensitive softy and she's super pissed that you didn't talk to her when she was leaning against that fence that one time... 




 Or just run straight through it all :D 




 Well. What about the 3 dozen or so baby great ones up near the upper ward and orphanage?  They all are drawn to where Ebriatis is - seemingly pining to get back to what is possibly their mother. 


Edit:  or are those Kin babies?  Like a precursor?  Because as a baby squid genuinr great one, we look muh different than the models used as ariannas baby. 


Also. By true ending they mean it is the only ending in which you truly transcend the hunt. The other two endings have u repeat it in some capacity. 
 




 Did you kill Ron the funky caterpillar?  It so, you are blocked temporarily from going back there.  




 Thanks. It's a bummer to hear they made experimentation harder in this game. Shit, I'd rather get blood stone chunks instead of mad men's knowledge :/ 




 You bet. I'm looking forward to it. Also, did you hear that they might be turning it into a movie? 




 For the chalice dungeons?  Yeah. I found a lot of the info on the spread sheets to be inaccurate or incomplete:  one dungeon had an extra rune in it, and another one said the blood rock is on level 2, but it was really on level 3. 


Or, do you mean you've found blood rocks in  each of the dungeons, and now when you try to go to a different glyph dungeon with a bloodrock supposedly inside, you find he madmen's knowledge in its stead? 




 Haha.  I'm sort of in the same boat.  I bought the PS4 as an Xmas present for myself, then played destiny for a few hours before I quit because it was a totally shit game, but then I got into the last of us, played it on and off for a few weeks, and I haven't picked it up since.  I was just thinking recently, *"I should go to youtube and finish up the rest of the story,"* as I tend to agree with you - shooters with controllers suck, and as fun as those sort of mechanics are in general, I tend to tire of them pretty quickly.  Sure, it's kinda fun to stealth around and bash peoples heads in and fight off zombies, for a bit, but then it just starts feeling redundant, and now that BB is out, I don't see myself going back to finish the game.  I'll definitely look up the rest of the story soon! 




 I took out the master race thing, and just put "PC gamer."  It's not about being better than, but if I can play a game on a machine that performs and displays the game better, I will at every chance I can get, which means I will always choose a PC unless the game is an exclusive like BB.  As for the achievements, again, I personally don't care or see the importance unless it's a challenge run (again, for the fun of the challenge, not the badge), or unless it unlocks more content or in-game items. 




 Have you played the last of us?  It's the only other game with it for PS4 (dice it's exclusive). Definitely a solid story game, a once in a generation type experience.  




 Are you a PC gamer?  If so, that is probably why :P


I'm a PC gamer myself, so I don't get the point of it either. The only reason I really see achievements mattering is when it actually unlocks more content or gives ou ingame rewards :D


Edit: I totally get challenge runs and stuff like that, but there aren't any Cheevos in BB for completing those. They're just little badges saying you completed parts of the main PvE game.  




 Do you need red jelly?  It unlocks as a purchasable item in the insight store, but I don't know the trigger for it. 

Edit - also, you should be able to find enough in the main game to open the chalice dungeon in the first place.  




 Really?  Fuckin aye!  I've been wanting to play that game so I am super happy to hear that!  Now I feel like the Bloodborne Player is starting to pull its own weight a bit more, and maybe I can stop calling it that :)


Edit:  But when will they make a new GoW game?  




 If you have the disposable income, sure it's worth it, but if not, I'd say don't do it if it's gonna stress your wallet.  There is The Last of Us remastered for PS4, which is definitely worth checking out and a great story of a game, but so far there are no other solid exclusives, or at least, games you can't play on other systems, and most games play better on PC anyhow.  Before BB, my PS4 was basically like a fancy paper-weight.  Maybe some more exclusives will come out (and next gen god of war plz?!) to make me think more highly of PS4 :D 




 In the pre-set dungeons?  No, there are no blood rocks in those, all the way down to the final boss :/ 




 Lots of people have already completed Level 4 Beastbro runs (onebro equivelant in this game:  lowest level you can be with no leveling, though any base starter class qualifies so long as you don't level for the most part).  


I'm working on one right now, and I'm just coming up on Shadows of Yharnam after clearing Cainhurst, and I can tell you that at 10 vitality for waste of skin starter class, most enemies and bosses kill you in one shot anyhow, so I don't see a vitality of 7 being all too different  :D 




 People need to shut the fuck up and mind their own business.  It's become way too common for people to interfere and be nosy with how other parents choose to raise their children.  There are far too many incidences of people misjudging a situation (which they have no business in, in the first place), say, seeing a kid being left in a car (on a perfectly cool day) for a minute, and calling the cops on the parent, even though the parent was just running in and out of the store for a quick minute.  Or god-forbid, you see a child playing outside, and someone calls the cops just because a parent isn't hovering over them.


The point is, all you pushy, needy, helicopter parents out there need to stop turning your children into pussies.  You're fucking ruining your kids.


 




 Statistics show that most children who are abducted are kidnapped by relatives and friends of the famly.  I'm more wary of the strangers I know than the strangers I don't knot.  Stranger-danger was bull-shit hype.  Of course, shit happens, but such is life. 




 Stranger danger is bull-shit anyhow.  The majority of children are abducted by family and friends of the children.  Don't worry so much about the strangers you don't know, worry more about the ones you do know.  Of course shit happens, but that's life, and more power to the parents, but I totally get the concerns.  Alls it takes is one nosy-ass shit-head who can't mind their own business, and bam, you have family services or cops called when your children are perfectly fine.


Fuck this generation of pushy, needy, over-emotional helicopter parents.  They're only serving to weaken the species, turn little boys into little girls, turn all children into total sissies, and hindering the future of the current generations and our country. 




 Clawmark.  I often use the +30% and +20% ones.  Nothing like killing Gherman on NG+ in 4 visceral attacks.  That, and the +15 and +20% stamina ones.  For the oath runes, imo, the hunter's oath rune is the only one that doesn't suck balls.  I'm totally bummed Eileen got killed by Henryk on my level 4 beastbro run, so now I'm gonna be stuck using the shitty executioner rune :/ 




 I agree.  I feel like Micolash was a wonky version of this.  It was so... anti-climactic. 




 Dude - you saying you don't like the Bag-Lady-Cultist look?  I rocked it for awhile until I put together Bone Ash and Crowfeather sets for a reaper vibe.  Though my level 4Bro is Lemmy fucking Kilmister, so he doesn't even need fashion to be awesome. 




 It's definitely not insight.  My level 4 Beastbro had over 10 insight before killing BSB, and they definitely don't spawn until after you kill the BSB. 




 I'm pretty sure you have to find her first before you kill Father G, as later, part of her dialogue is, "So you killed father G huh?" 




 So no one is sure if we are limited to one blood rock ever for each dungeon type?  Ie., I alrready collected 3 blood rocks from each of the loran, Isz, and Pthumerian dungeons.  Does that mean I will never find a blood rock in one of those types again, even if I use different glyphs?  (The three I found were using other people's glyphs, I have yet to explore the ones I originally created myself). 




 Yes, you can get blood rocks from the lowest depths chalice dungeons.  So far I have looted an additional three blood rocks from the lowest root loran, pthumeryn (sp), and isz chalice dungeon glyphs (two from the reddit spreadsheet, and one from fextralife), though I don't know if these are limited, ie., I don't know if you are limited to one bloodrock ever per chalice root type just like you are limited to one blood rock per play through for the main game, or if you can keep running different variations of a root chalice to farm blood rocks.  Can anyone confirm?  Thanks. 




 The level design in both games was awesome, and in bloodborne, the awesome design definitely hid how straight-forward and linear the game really is, though once you learn the maps in either DaS or BB, areas that once seemed sprawling and large really aren't sprawling or large at all.  Even if you have a few wider areas, most places are enclosed between walls and pits or fairly straight-forward paths.


That being said, I thought the variations within BB were pretty great, from gothic cities to the woods, to the nightmares, to the dungeons and so forth, but I'd rather them keep it focused, rather than trying to cram in a volcano world or any other number of cool environments that might not have fit, though hey probably could have implemented a marsh for sure, and maybe a snowy area (more so than the outside of Cainhurst castle which is very small).  Still, I'd rather see it focused like bloodborne, rather than overly ambitious and thus lacking in feeling and atmosphere.  Even then, Dark Souls design suffered a bit past Anor Londo due to time constraints, and DaS2 was definitely stitched and connected together the poorest out of all the games, though the areas (often small) were still fun to explore the first time around.  



The problem is imo, Dark Souls is just one hell of a game to live up to, and it was so new and fresh and unseen in the gaming world (not including DeS here), whereas BB in all its different glory, is still sort of more of the same.  I bet if BB had been released first, and DaS came years later, we would be saying BB was better, because it made such a large impression on us, and you just can't beat nostalgia and that virgin feeling for games like this. 




 I think the statues are statues in yharnam, as they have base stands, and are very repetitive and numerous, and they are also larger than hunan size. The statues in yahr'gul do indeed look like people who were turned to stone just like pompei as they were fleeig for their lives, and this all happened when the nightmare ritual was completed after Rom's death (there are many indicators and notes in game hinting that rom is blocking communication with the great ones, ie, the lake is mud, the byrgenwyrth spider keeps the master (great ones) from us (the cultists), the spider is hiding the rituals)  nd even his name vacuous somehow indicates he is absorbing/blocking the red moon and the rituals)The rest of the people in yahr'gul look like they were fused together into massive lumps of human-flehipedes. It sort of reminds me of the way philosopher stones were created in the series fullmetal alchemist - you had to sacrifice a lot of people for that shit, and it is possible it was the same in yahr'gul.  




 I would ignore them, as the depth 3 ones are lacking in challenges and rewards IMO. By the time I completed the standard dungeon progression, I had more than enough materials to make 3-4 depth 5 glyph dungeons, and plenty of insight to buy more materials, and I quickly obtained 3 blood rocks in one day as well as the top tier of all my favorite runes. 


Edit; as for the challenge, there's nothing like fightin a cannon armed undead giant as a regular enemy that is surrounded by dogs while a bell lady sends endless waves of red asshole spiders at you :D 




 I'm just glad iframes are no longer tied to stats :D


That being said, the worst thing to me about dodging while locked on isn't the movement, but some of the terrible camera angles, especially for large enemies. Staying locked on can be super handy, especially to take advantage of openings and to put yourself in favorable positions, but I've died more to the camera angles than the actual bosses themselves :/ 




 Thanks for the ideas and tips. Going to cainhurst ASAP is a great idea. Sad to hear viscrals are out the window, but I've still been using parry for the free attack window and to ease the pressure off, but the difficulty has definitely has ramped up after Amelia. I don't think I have the patience for this shit tonight (I just died 5 times in a row in the same spot, mostly in one hits from the big axe guys). I think I'll play my main and go spill some blood in the chalice dungeons to unwind -_- 




 Did you get the bloodrock to +10 your weapon?  There is one in the main game in each playthrough.  I missed it on my first no help/spoiler/solo/blind run through, and NG+ was a bit harsh at first, and having a +9 weapon for most of it definitely sucked :D 




 My pro-tip - dodge/roll/strafe to any bosses right side, just get the timing right for their attacks, and never get greedy, and you can pretty much kill every boss in this game that way (aside the ones you should shoot to parry)...especially this asshole.  He once gave me a lot of problems and had me against a wall for a minute, but now he is trivial and I have farmed him several times, including his funky ass...sick version.  (Same method for Parl/Loran Darkbeast by the way) 




 Eh, even then, not all 5's and 6s and 10-20s are created equal.  I forget the exact way they said it was calculated...but yeah, gems in this game are kind of obnoxious :/ 




 Dude.  I've gotten a bunch of rocks from various dungeons, but I have never seen a chunk to date, and that's with running all the lowest depth dungeons and root dungeons  




 Dude.  You say that now, but when you see the new saw cleaver soaps.... 




 No parries?!  Why would you do that to yourself?! 




 Dude.  Don't get me started.  Sinh's stupid fucking 20 mile-span wonky ass hit box that one-shots you while being a mile above your head is total bull-shit   




 Did you use +flat damage gems on your weapons like raw enchants from previous titles?  Or did you use +%physical damage?  Did you experiment?  If so, which gems come out to be more total damage towards end game for Bloodbros?  Also, what were some of the most useful rune setups you found?  I have a few in mind, but I'll have to see how they play out.  Also, how dare you speak unfavorably about the Great Axe of Cheese!  It served you well!  It loves you!  It wants to make mutant alien babies with you! 




 But I thought you can't use the burial blade cuz of stat deficiencies?



Also, I have a few questions for you if ya don't mind.  It is a post of mine yet to be published that I copied/pastrad in draft form that I plan on putting up soon, once reddit stops giving me it's bullshit "you can't do that message:"



So, I just killed Vicar last night (Reindeer dog bitch ruined my no-death kill streak, then Hynrick proceeded to kill Eileen, and then me repeatedly), so I'm not too far into the game, but I was curious for the OneBros who are further in the game or who have beaten it, what has been your best option to pump up your damage, especially for visceral attacks?  For example, Even with a +3 or 4 hunter's axe with the only gems I have at around +2 or 3% physical attack, my viscerals on Heynryk were only doing around 100 damage, and that dude has a few thousand health, so I set that fight aside for later, though I'm pissed I can't get the only Oath rune worth a damn in this run-through, but I digress.



Another question in line with this is - has anyone found a build (combo of runes and gems) to really maximize visceral damage, and make it more worthwhile?  I mean, either way, it is a valuable move anyhow to buy time and avoid direct combat/damage, but I'm wondering what the end game numbers can look.



That being said, anyway, how does the damage look later on in the game with more options?  Ie, the +flat damage blood gems are pointless on say, my main high level toon with pumped STR/SKL, but for those who have come across the +flat damage gems on their onebros, do they wind up being the equivelant of Raw type enchants for your higher level weapons, and thus are better for OneBros?  I mean, I don't have any yet to calculate it myself (and no clawmark runes to pump damage either), but does anyone have the stats or info on how a +9 or +10 weapon on a OneBro looks damage-wise, specifically whether or not +% runes or +flat damage runes wind up being better?  Thanks in advance for your input, and any other tips or tricks are welcome as well. 




 Ah, ok, that explains why it seemed so wonky, as i'd double tap share to start recording, and it would seemingly then not record my next actions (ie, killing father G and cleric beast on 4Bro first attempts ) 




 Dude.  BeastBro all the way.  FourBro just doesn't sound right :D 
























 Vicar is a pushover on a level 4 beastbro run, let alone regular character runs.  I think Father G is the only remotely challenging boss out of the first 3 (cleric, father G and Vicar). 




 Ah.  I remember getting there right after I got the cord from Mergo's wet nurse, and before I even had a chance to inspect the item, I went to Gherman and when he said subit, I thought, I didn't come this far for some geriatric mother-fucker to mercy-kill me.  Bam.  On into NG+, and I was sad because I wasn't finished exploring :D 




 Update:  Here is the post I mentioned.  It is based off a lot of solid in-game info, as well as concrete info. from the game guide (that often isn't in the game).  Be warned though:  SPOILERS!


https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/33hj91/yharnam_was_never_the_destination_lore_spoilers/ 




 I'll find the link for you later when I get home. And I said MP because I didn't want to spoil anything for you. What ending did you get? 




 Oooooh. The "up" part was hidden by my phone. That makes more sense, but still, all I can see now is "how to dick your murders." :D 




 Alls I can make out is "how to dick your murders," but something tells me I am reading that wrong :D 




 Yeah. I have yet to see a satisfactory explanation of them, or something beyond a brief mention. The best I heard so far that fit within te known/posited lore, is that they were messengers/servants of the MP. The guy who posted it made enough sense, but at the same time, there might have been discrepancies in what he posted and te time-line of events and characters, as there is clear architecture and statues based off the messengers in the labyrinth, and the chalice dungeons definitely predate the city of Yharnam and the current events.  




 Beast roar can deflect projectiles. Pretty sure nothing else can... 




 I got invaded while I was wielding the BOM, trying em on for size for the previous micolash boss fight, so I tried them out for that duel and I totally got my ass handed to me. Aside not being used to them in general, the range is shit, and their dodge attacks are pretty easy to avoid.  Should have known better since I have yet to die myself to someone using BoM :D 




 I just think 20 vials is too many, for PvE and PvP. The max should be 10 or 12 (aside runes), and they should heal for a bit more. 30 makes te game too easy and encourages sloppy play :/ 




 Yep.  She had quite a few new moves.  Bitch went total ape-shit on me, extending her arms and turning everything black and going clone-slut on me etc. 




 Lots of posts of people confirming that you can, so long as you are in level range as Siam09 mentioned. 




 I think 'true ending' is what the community dubbed it.  The game calls it "childhood ending."  But yeah.  Pretty awesome. 




 I've continued to level my original character up to 200, because he is always swimming in millions of echoes, so I just ran with him to be able to play with all the different items and weapons.  I don't play him that much, because I have more fun with focused builds (that sacrafice one thing for another, instead of total maxed out badass) - and once you learn the game, you can run through it super quick to make more focused, lower level builds for multiplayer.  As a result, I have a level 90 STR, level 90 SKL toon, and a level 90 BT toon, and I plan on rounding it out with an arcane build and a quality build (I enjoy the simplicity and serratedness of the saw weapons) :D


The point is, if you level too high, you are cutting yourself off from the larger meta of more dedicated (for lack of a better word) players. 




 How quickly in game can you turn Ludwig's into an arcane weapon?  Like, what's the earliest arcane gem you can find?  I wanted to make an arcane build, and I heard Ludwig's was one of the best for those.  Also, is Ludwig's better on a quality build?  Thanks. 




 That game is one of the best ever made.  The 'true' ending reminded me of SoC :D 




 Hmmm. At a glance, that seems much quicker. What was that?  10-15 seconds total?  Compared to before, which seemed like 40-45 seconds?  Also. Is that a stock HD?  Or a SSD? 




 Also, what about Laurence?  :D   




 Also, what about the giant "eyes in the sky" in Old Yharnam? 




 Hey Icarus.  Thanks again for your post the other day, and thanks for this write-up as well.  I am pressed for time at the moment, but I have one thing to ask about in the meantime, well, several things but all about the same subject - and that is about the messengers.


I think this is the first post I've seen where someone actually talks more about the messengers, at least, one that fits better with all the other lore that is given or posited.  If they are MP's homeboys, why do we see their likeness in the chalice dungeons?  I mean, it seems the messengers predate MP and Gherman, or was MP always around meddling, and Gherman just came later?  Either way, it is quite murky, but very simply, What does that time-line look like?


Also relevant - I like what you posted about the brain.  I feel like the brain and it's eyeball infection has hardly been touched by the community, especially the people who commonly make lore videos.  That being said, what is your opinion on the brain and it's seemingly spreading corruption?  Who are those iron golems, and why are they seemingly tasked with killing off the baby eyeball brains?  At first glance, I though they were spider eggs, as there were giant spiders nearby, and they looked like milky white egg sacks, but then later you see the brain, and the eyeballs growing on everything, and this leaves me to think that these are baby wintern lanterns/brain trusts that are spreading and growing, but why are the golems killing them?  If the brain was created as a form for the great one to inhabit, or whatever else it could be, why are they killing the babies?  Simply trying to control an experiment that got out of hand?  Because it seems like those eyeballs grow into the brain trusts.  And as for the brain trusts, why is their brain matter made out of messengers?  I don't have the time to re-read this and try to figure out where this stands in your facts/speculation write-up, but how do the messengers fit in with the idea that they are MP's servants/messengers, yet they also make up those brains, including the mother brain?  I suppose they could have been kidnapped by Mensis school and used in the experiments/conjuring then?  Would love to hear your thoughts.  Thanks. 




 Uuuh, what? 




 Right, but from what I've read on here, the vial and consumable system (namely bullets) makes it hard for new players, and it winds up as double frustration for them, because they need to farm vials period, but they aren't that good at the game, so they then use as many as they farm or just die more.  Same thing with insight.  They run out of insight, often on failed summons, and they don't know how to get more, or can't find more.  Etc.  For veteran FROM fans, I think this game was pretty easy to catch the hang of, but for new players, not so much.  Either way though, it all funnels you towards the direction of 'git guud skrub,' but I totally see how it could turn some people off, but my point remains.  10 vials (with the same runes to increase the numbers, I mean, who the fuck needs 24 or 25 vials?) would mean you don't have 20 vials to burn through each time, and thus would hopefully learn to play more carefully and be more cautious.  I think it would be the best balance between the two, and also, make PvP and PvE in general just more exciting and dangerous :D 




 Uhhhh, still nope.  I don't see where Brain Trust comes from :D  I don't think I'm being too dense... 




 I think Blood vials should be limited to 10 or 12 tops, but they should heal for a larger percentage of health.  I feel like once you get the hang of this game, even in chalice 5s and NG++++ and especially for PvP, 20 is just way too many vials, and if anything, I tend to fight and play better the less crutches or healing items I have to lean on.  I feel like having so many just encourages sloppy play, and makes the game too forgiving. 




 Winter lanterns?  I know that comes from the guide, but that just flat out sounds like a print error, typo, or really bad translation...


Also. Where did the name "brain trust" come from in the first place?  :D


Edit:  But yes. Fuck those things.  




 Yeah. Hopefully the patch helps, drastically. Otherwise I do worry about the longevity of this game.its hard for me to understand how FROM really fucked up multiplayer so bad, and the loading screens shouldn't just be brushed aside either. Those are some critical errors for them, and I feel like they should have known better or done better. 


 And I know dark souls 2 was far from perfect, but it was still the best game of 2014, and I'm pretty sure all of us FROM fans had a lot of fun with it and played it more than anything else, which is kind of funny considering how much everyone bitches about it. The point is, B-Team still gets a cookie :) 




 I think that is just the example that some bosses show up as regular enemies sometimes, like undead giants and what not.  




 The thing being the MP's dream is a theory, but yes, we do know Ebrietas is a great one, and we do know the other great ones have form - that I am not denying, but it is important to note where these forms exist, as this game pays great attention to details in where and when characters exist.  Ebrietas is the only one that exists in form in the waking/physical world.  The other great ones have form too, but they exist in their respective realities/dreams/realms (Amygdala in Nightmare frontier, the brain and mhergo in nightmare of mensis, etc).  The implied message about the great ones is that they transcended the limitations of their physical bodies (through force of will, like the hunters learned to dodo), and they can clearly alter and affect reality, and that is the sort of power and knowledge that the characters and institutions in this game have been chasing.  




 I didn't say it was better, and you might be right about that, but there are still some holes to be poked:  the lagstabs and phantom bull-shit has always been a problem with FROM's servers or whatever gerbil-wheel set-up they have going on.


And at least they added the agape ring at pretty much direct requests from players to offset SM in DaS2.  That being said, DaS2 was far less laggy for me than DaS.  DaS had terrible PvP lag for me and imo, and it killed a lot of the fun.  DaS2 was much smoother, and other than hackers, in a zillion games of PvE and PvP, I never had people warping all over the place. 




 Sure. I always enjoy the lore discussions, whether it's someone teahimg me something, or poking holes in someone else's theories. And I always love that the different interpretations only bring up more and more questions :D 




 In general, it's to keep you at a certain level to be able to easily interact with the majority of the community. Most people seem to be stickin between levels 75-120 for both PvE and PvP. It also forced you to actually has to pick and choose your item/magic/weapon usage to make for unique characters and fights. If everyone had 50 in every stat, it would make the game a bit droll as you would be over leveled and over powered, whereas with a level cap, you actually have to make some sacrifices for your build to specialize in certain areas.  




 Ah. Ok. All square here.  




 Fair point :) 




 Yeah. The impressions from the game were that all the great ones weren't necessary one happy pantheon of gods, but that they all had their individual motives an desires, and not all of them were created equal. Thanks for the info. Look forward to hearing what else you might be able to add to it.  




 Dude... the decent damage, the awesome move-set.  The staggers, the range, the sweeps, the knock downs, the long-range R2 followed by a quick R1.... and I just can't put that thing down!  I swear - I tried the rest, but the damage and range of the hammer sucked, and it was way too slow.  Same with the wheel.  Why can't their be any other STR weapon equivelants?!

FOR THE RECORD:  Most of the 2hand damage, and even like, half the 1h damage, comes from blunt damage, not physical.  Check out the post from Icarus with the pictures from the official guide. 




 But if it were to wind up remotely similar, then NO please :D 




 Woohooo!  I see my judas priest reccomendation in there :)

Sad Wings of Destiny was fuckin awesome! 




 Haha. YUP.  Moar coffee and vapes please! 




 Awww, I know the doll says, "I hope you find your worth in the waking world," implying Yharnam and all that, but she is dumb and naive.  I was really hoping Yharnam was a dream of the great ones, and in a sense, we were trying to wake up the great ones, as the world was them retaining their consciousness throuhg force of will, just like Mensis Nightmare and Micolash, Gherman and the hunter's dream, etc.  Their physical bodies are dead and/or gone, but they are still alive on a different plane of existence.  Ok.  This makes it a little less interesting :/ 




 Umm, no, we don't need an alternative to the OP ridiculous bug of the rifle spear (great weapon, the bug aside).  I don't think the Reiter's bullets not scaling with arcane is a mistake.  I think the Rifle Spear's ridiculous damage is a mistake/bug. 




 Actually, I think the doll is just a construct, but due to her coy and aloof nature, she comes off as aloof, almost as if she knows more than she lets on, but in reality she really is quite simple and naive...  fun speculation though :D


Edit:  based on what others with the guide say that the guide says, aside the doll's obvious nature (as she even says she was created by humans, and seemingly is quite simple) 




 Wow.  Crzy to see that my high % +physical gems are nearly useless, or rather, only effective seemingly less than half the time in the axe...  Ok, I'm definately going to have to buy this book! 




 Yeah, it was pretty disturbing when you find mild-mannered Alfred post ape-shit status, covered in gore, and so entrenched in his violence, that he hardly even recognizes or cares to see you, the player character :D 




 I'm fan enough, and I enjoy all things Bloodborne, so I likely will.  Apparently it is hard copy on Amazon for 25 bucks or so?  That sounds like one hell of a deal! 




 Bingo.  He is hiding the rituals from sight, or from being completed.  In turn, Rom is also keeping the cultists/servants from their master (the great one(s) ).  It even says "ritual seal" broken when you kill Rom, which fulfills the note you first see in Yahr Guhl (sp) of "madmen work in madness to bring about more madness rituals," or whatever. 




 Ah ok, so it isn't that he wants the ritual to be completed (via breaking the seal by killing Rom), he wants you to stop the WHOLE ordeal, not just the small portion that Rom is scrambling or blocking?


Edit:  Speaking of which - is there any more info on Rom?  How he got there, or who or what he is?    Or how he became to be the seal that blocks the cultist's rituals?  I firmly believe (ed) that he is not human and never was.


 




 But they're so cute! 




 So, is this from the Bloodborne Collector's Edition Strategy Guide by Future Press?  Thanks. 




 Hmmm, this sort of hints at my thoughts that the brain was indeed a great one (as descibed in game), but he was more or less thought into being somewhere between the other great ones wills, Micolash, the Mensis School, and the age old adage of wanting to "grow eyes on the mind." 




 Dude.  I thoroughly enjoyed your post, but how does anyone play Destiny for more than two or three hours tops?  I mean, I get it, the compulsion to play grindy games often lasts longer than the fun, but the decent graphics and run-of-the-mill yet tight shooter mechanics weren't even remotely redeeming of the fact that it was completely unimaginative, generic, had no intrigueing characters or plot points, the voice acting was terrible, it had mediocre gameplay, and by mission 2 or 3, they were already recycling the same maps...


Ahem.  Sorry, I just really hate that game and how shitty it was, and how everyone rushed out to buy such a polished hype-turd.  And to this  day, I'm still baffled that anyone can stomach it :D 




 Punished for failing to learn?  But that is how life is, and how it should be, and it is a shame there are so many stupid people out there not being punished as much as they probably deserve.  But it is such a great parallel to existense itself - art imitating life really :D 




 I use the opposite strategy to avoid her, be it in NG+++, or chalice dungeons.  If I lock on her, I can't see when to start running to avoid the one-shot lasers, as trying to roll or dodge stops me for a split second, and I get zapped.  I know they make noises, but I'm usually too stressed to  figure that out in those moments.  I've subsequently locked her down to where I can kill her in one attempt every time, even on new characters, but man oh man, trying not to die in that last phase the first time fighting her was brutal  




 Yes.  There are a lot of gaps to fill, but so far, it would seem that we don't even know what the real world is anymore.  The only way to wake up the moon presence is by our will becoming powerful enough that we can retain consciousness upon death (the way gherman, micolash, and the other great ones do, even after permanent death of the body), and the only way we can do this is by killing Gherman himself, and this only results in slavery to the MP because we do not have the insight to know that the MP is is there orchestrating this blood-orgy and fucking with us.  After having the necessary insight through the umbilical cords themselves (seemingly the blue-print of evolution and the 'how to' of becoming a great one') we begin to see through the dreams, and then we finally arise to front and center stage of the brutal shit-show of the MP's nightmare realm, and we get the MP's attention.  The MP still wants to make us a thrall to his will and his dream, but we say, *"not today bitch, we know better,"* and when we finally kill it, we become the new Chief Asshole and somehow usher humanity forward into a new age of it's Baby Squid-Monster Overlord...
 




 It still wound up making quicker and easier multiplayer connections, be it for PvE or PvP :/ 




 Gotcha.  Thanks.  Did some more reading up on the original post and the updates and comments and I see what they mean.  Hopefully these odds and ends get fixed sooner rather than later. 




 Gotcha.  I remember seeing the original post a few days ago.  Just read up on the updates and the comments, and I see what you guys mean now.  Thanks Atrophy and Vividos. 




 Dude.  I loved the rifle spear in PvE (talking regular use, not arcane exploit), even though the damage was relatively weak for the first half of the game.  The weapon is fun, and it comes with a lot of reach and versatility.  The build I was using it on was switched to BT (I was just using the rifle-spear cuz I hated the cane), and I was hoping to make a dedicated PvE/PvP rifle spear build just because it was one of the most fun weapons I've played with, but I suppose I'd rather wait till this arcane rifle spear stuff blows over as well :/ 




 I don't believe MP and Oedeon are one in the same myself, but see my above post, as we technically don't see the MP in the "physical world" either (if one even exists in game).  We only encounter the MP in Gherman's dream, and I believe the rest of the game is the MP's dream, hence we are trying to transcend it by waking it up, and refusing to become its thrall. 




 Not that the MP is clearly defined, but Odeon is more clearly defined, as he is described as the formless Great One who exists only in thoughts or words or whatever, which is where the Caryll runes come from.  The MP clearly has a physical form, though we only see it in Gherman's dream, which might mean it has no physical form either, as it supports the idea that the Great One's ascencion is them leaving there physical bodies behind, which is supported by the fact that Ebrietas, the great one that was explicitly described as "being left behind" and "abandoned," is the only one we see in the waking or physical world, which might be a great one's dream in the first place, because the whole game is a series of character's wills forcing them to retain their consciousness, ie., Gherman's Dream, Micolash's dreams (whose dead body we actually see after The One Reborn) and so forth, and it seems our character's true mission is to wake the great ones from their dreams, so we can transcend it.  I believe the waking world (as the Doll implies) is the MP's (a great one's) dream, and I do not believe him and Oedeon are one in the same.  Oedeon is just one of the former great ones that has ascended and left the physical realms behind, and has never been seen in a dream, be it his or someone else's. 




 How do we know that you're not supposed to be able to?  Does arcane not apply to the reittersplash then?  And accidentally apply to the rifle spear?  Thanks. 




 Dude.  I missed the charred set on my first toon my first time around, But I absolutely fucking love the full charred armor set with the top hat!   




 Well, it partially summons her, as in, it shoots out her tentacles.  Other in-game item descriptions relating to the choir tell us Ebrietas was a great one that was left behind.  It seems they use strong language either way in saying "abandoned" and "left behind."  Maybe she wasn't strong enough to transcend her physical body like the other great ones seemingly did? 




 Oedeon:  *"Should we bring Ebrietas with us when we leave?"*


Moon Presence:  *"Shhhhhh!  No dude!  She stands like, right in your face when she speaks to you.  Seriously, doesn't she have any concept of personal space?  Let's just leave her behind."* 




 Item descriptions say she is a great one, and that she "was left behind."  My guess based off lore is that the great ones were able to transcend their physical bodies (in the same way in-game items tell us hunters can retain their consciousness through sheer force of will, ie., like gherman and his dream, or dead micolash and him as host of the nightmare).  The schools and church and players in game are trying to transcend the physical world it seems, transcend the realites in front of them, and it seems the hunter exists in gherman's dream, and he is trying to wake the current great one (the moon prescence) up from its dream... but it all only brings up more questions. 




 But between the choir garb and other in-game item descriptions, the game flat out tells us that Ebrietas is indeed a Great One, and that she was left behind, left-behind being the real question as to what it means.  Did the other ones ascend?  They seem to not exist in the physical realm, and only exist in mind and dreams and other realms of existence.  Why was Ebrietas left behind?  Etc? 




 How is it that it winds up so kerplow-powerful?  The flat arcane damage gets applied to each pellet and is thus more powered than a % gem could make it?  I loved playing with the rifle spear (regular gem slots, didn't know how OP it could be) in the PvE game on my skill build (since I hated the cane) until I went for Evylyn/Chikage.  I wanted to make a build around the weapon because it was so much fun, though the damage was a bit lacking - but I don't want to make a build around this since it will likely be patched out..  




 Is it really a glitch though?  I just thought it was OP mechanics the way the arcane rifle spear turns out? 




 Welcome to Camera Souls, where the hardest enemy you will ever fight is ultimately, THE CAMERA!


YOU DIED! 




 The brain is a great one that was found/created in the nightmare (see the description of living string item). The first eyeball growths you see are dead and covered in a milky white film, hence I said I and others mistook them for spider eggs, especially with the appendages that look like they are coming out of eggs. Later, in the area of mother brain, you can clearly see they are eyeballs growing on everything, which is seemingly what happens if it is left unchecked. The question is, what are they, why are they growing, and who are the little iron golems and why are they seemingly trying to poke out all the eyeballs? 




 Mother Brain and her scourge of eyeballs that are over-running the Nightmare of Mensis.  The first time through that area, we see those pale, milky white sacks covering various parts of the level and the mansion where Micolash resides.  At a glance, I thought they were spider eggs, after all, there seem to be legs growing out of many of them, and there is a giant spider and her spiderlings nearby.  It all seemed simple enough.  From there, you observe the little iron golem men in the mansion strolling around, as if they are tasked to destroy these eggs, since the eggs have arrows/spikes jabbed through them.  It isn't until you find the hidden area with Mother Brain that you see that they aren't innocuous little sacks of spider eggs, but actual eyeballs, as if the brain is replicating, or spreading some sort of disease or curse or who knows what.  Those are the obvious ideas behind it (the mother brain spreading her rottenness), but I was curious what other people's ideas and opinions and speculations were about this area and how it relates to Mother Brain, the iron golems, and the spreading eyeball scourge.  It's almost like the opposite of much of the rest of the game, where the characters and enemies willingly blindfold or blind themselves to keep from seeing what is before them.  I look forward to your replies.  Thanks. 




 They don't scale.  Sure, the first crows you meet in game don't have as many HP as the same crow enemies later on in the game, but they are just adjusted to general game progression.  They don't slide along with your direct leveling/gameplay. 




 Dude.  Charred Hunter's set is pimp!  So much Heavy-Metal-Dracula-Bad-Ass hunter goodness.  Looks great with the Top Hat, and so many other things! 




 Great One***, not Old One  :D
 




 You are new to the Souls games huh?  Yes.  You are doing exactly what you need to be doing, and you are exactly where you need to be.  Do not look up spoilers or info or help.  Slug it out and play blind through one of video gaming's most unique experiences :D 




 For pretty much the entire game, including the weak ass final (or near final) boss :D 




 I think this game was the easiest, because a lot of us players knew what to look for and expect from a FROM game.  Once upon a time, stumbling upon a black knight as a newb in Dark Souls got you wreckt, but now you can go fight it no problem, or even beat the game as a onebro.  Remember, this game and its mechanics and brutality are new to a lot of people.  Sure, even for longer term Souls players it takes some time to learn the new combat system, but once you get that down, it is essentially more of the same.  Try to imagine playing DeS or DaS or BB for the first time, or as your first FROM game.  That being said, I agree.  The Chikage hunter in the Grand Cathedral is harder than pretty much all the bosses in the game. 




 That was all speculation and hype. 




 I think they should have just kept the tried and true summoning sign method, and to keep with the theme, instead of little runic signs via soapstones, it could have just been your messengers sitting there, rining the bells for you. 




 Traded in DaS1 and 2?  I get it, the games aren't for everyone.  Go play CoD  :P 




 TIL That everyone hates the books they were forced to read in high school.  That, and a lot of people don't understand literature, or its significance in history...  Not everyone is meant to or likes to read.  Go back to watching TV.   There are a lot of ignorant people here.  BRING ON THE DOWN VOTES! :D 




 A lot of people had mentioned it and continue to mention it, but it was far more original and it pushed the bar for its time, though other authors who remain unpopular or unheard of had done it better decades before Salinger, so yeah, fuck that book, but hey, it set the bar for generations of self-absorbed navel-gazers to come! 




 But it set the bar for generations of self-absorbed navel-gazers to follow!  It's like, the thing to do! 




 Longer reply:  I didn't mean to dismiss micolash'd blatherings, since as you said, insight is madness in this game, but another key thing he says is "the lake is mud," or something like that, implying how Rom hides or hinders the rituals the church is trying to work, hence he has the title vacuous. It answers the question of why Wilhem hid him  - Rom is there to be a scrambler to the church. Something about him/her/it hides/hinders the church's workings. The church knows Wilhem is at odds with them, and they sent a hunter in choir garb to keep watch on him - hunter who even uses the auger of Ebriatis, the great one that was left behind, the great one the church found, and the only great one that actually exists in the physical (or dreaming or waking?) world. 


Also. Every other human in bloodborne gets a lot of screen time, dialogue, or descriptions in the game via items or notes, yet there is none at all tht mention rom except those that reference te bergynwyrth spider. I don't believe this is incidental, accidental, or intentional. There is no mention of Rom the human, because he never was human.  The implication is that rom is somehow kin (yes, great one blood is an item in game, and we get none from rom), and an interpretation of what Micolash says is akin to Jenny in forest gump, when she says, "dear god, make me as a bird so I can fly far away."  She doesn't actually expect to be turned into a bird, or that birds were other entries that were just one day slapped with the gift of wings. She just wants their ability. There is no concrete evidence in what Micolash says to make it truly lean one way or the other, but based on all the evidence in game, and the fact that Rom the human is never mentioned, I happen to believe Micolash just meant what he said about rom as, "I want what he has."  Nothing more, nothing less. 


And still, this only brings up more questions of "who, what, when and why?"  Your thoughts?   :) 




 Quick reply: I thought the same thing, until I found "great one blood" in a chalice dungeon, and thought, 'holy shit. That's a big difference'. Worth noting, great one blood (at least in coldblood form) is not pale. 


Will read and write more later.  




 And this hiding keeps it from coming to fruition by blocking people's perceptions?  Hence the title vacuous? 




 Dude. I hated the blunderbuss too. It seemed do much more clunky and harder to use than pistols :/ 




 I thought vacuous was somehow relate to how Rom is sort of like a signal scrambler, somehow keeping the cultist's rituals from working. He ce, once you kill him, the ritual in the unseen village is completed successfully, everyone is killed and the one reborn is...reborn. This is supported by the notes, "the spider keeps all manner if rituals from us."  As well as, "The Byrgynwyrth spider keeps our master from us."  The spider is rom, and the master is the one reborn or the kin or the great ones themselves or whatever, not Wilhem as a lot of people presume. This could furthermore support the Wilhem being at direct odds with te churh, hence e summoned Rom, though a lot of the details are still missing. 


Worth noting, a lot of people think Rom was a person turned into a weird creature, but there is nothing in game at all to support this. I think Rom is kin, he ce we get kin blood and not great one blood from him. People like to reference micolash'd dialogue, but that is the ranting of a madman, and saying "give us eyes as you have Rom," doesn't mean Rom was born as a human and later gifted with eyes. It can just as well mean he was simply born/created that way, and Micolash says "give us eyes like rom" just like a child might say "I want wings like the birds so I can fly"


There's another idea I have that I have yet to see be discussed - and that is the brain that is covered in eyes, which in game it is directly called a great one, and the point is, with all the lines between humanity and our base nature and dreams and reality being blurred, was the brain found?  Or was it forged through the yearnings and experiments of mensis and wilhem's sayings "line our brains with eyes."  Very simply, was the brain basically "thought" into existence through the nightmare, the great ones, and the wills of those working on te crazy experiments? 




 Not all the chalice merchants are. I remember one or some of the others in a dead end room that was an offshoot of one of the paths.  




 Right. And it took me awhile to figure those tougher enemies out. I honestly think FROM put them there to crush the player and their spirit, because new players just cant or wont stan a chance asindt them, andeven with good equipment those enemies can own you if you underestimate them, but I think they are there so that when you come back to kill them, you can really see how much better you have become as a player :D 




 I got ya though.  Like Hellkite drake?  Or black Knights?  I mean, even then, Hellkite drake was definitely not meant to be killed right away, and Onebro stuff is when you have already become pro enough at the game and you need a challenge, but you're absolutely right.  There are no real "HOLY SHIT" moments of, *'that guy fucking stomped me, and I would have never in a million years beat him my first go or anywhere near it.'*  


But, aren't you looking at this from the perspective of a vetted FROM fan?  What about the people new to the series who took days or weeks to kill the first two bosses?  I bet those executioner's were about as hard as black knights were back in the day, wouldn't you think?


I mean, we've also come to expect this from them, so I think the player base has just gotten better at playing FROM's games as well, and they know what to expect, and it is hard to recapture those previous moments of "holy jebus who was that that just stomped me!?" 




 You know, big poisonous blood monsters that make you sick? 




 Judas Priest - The Ripper 




 Pendant in its usefulness, but I think iris there to cement the lore. The whole the great ones and hunters and etc can retain their consciousness trough force of will, even if there bodies are dead.  




 You know that's not the Blood Letting Beast that everyone complains about as hard, right?  :P 




 What a bunch of assholes.  Tell them to go play CoD if they are going to complain about what has been an excellent staple since the beginning of FROM's game design.  It adds a nice touch of needed variety and excitement and exploration.  I'd love to see more Sen's fortresses and Cainhurst's and traps and AIDS monsters! 




 Yeah.  The worst part of Cainhurst is how short it is, though the excellent level design in general of BB really hides how short and linear the game actually is :/ 




 What was your poison resist at?  My level 4 bro couldn't do the last phase of that fight without getting herpes, cuz that fucker just looks at me and BAM, I get bloodbeast AIDS and my HP starts dropping like dead hookers in my basement, and I gotta use an antidote cuz that shit is super powerful.  Even with chucking molotovs and blood lure potions, that fucker still moves to fast and is on me giving me the beast herp before I can even tap the dodge button. 




 "Oh look (Gherman), you found yourself a (another) hunter."


"May you find your worth in the waking (dreaming) world." 




 Haha.  At first I thought, "Look, those crows think they are dogs!" and later I was all like, "Holy shit, those dogs fucked those crows!"


That, and I thought it was some sort of bad Japanese to English transition, like, somehow, Miyazaki thought crows barked in English speaking countries :D 




 Why would anyone use a cannon for PvE?  I mean, other guns and weapons are far more versatile and useful, and they don't take such a large stat investment and use half of a precious resource in one shot :D


My only suggestion is using pistol for parry and visceral ing him to death. You just need the patience and the practice. I haven't gotten to him yet on my level 4 beast bro, but the plan is to parry+charge or strong attack, since level 4 viscerals don't do shit for damage.  




 Lots of lower tier rune, 2 blood stone chunks, and a lot of other bloodstone upgrades.  Coming here ASAP was indispensable for my level 4 beastbro  :D 




 For low stat characters?  Yes, for sure.  Beastbro uses an axe though, because I hate the cane, and the axe is badass and has an indispensalbe moveset and good crowd control.  I just use the % ones for now, because I have never really seen a worthwhile flat damage gem outside of a chalice dungeon IIRC  :D 




 I've gotten quite a few at random off rats, but why do you need to farm for them?  In following standard dungeon progression, and thoroughly exploring those and the later root chalices you create for loot, you should have more than enough crafting materials to make a few top tier dungeons at any given time. 




 You can run in tighter circles though and make it proc quicker, so yes, it is faster to a point.  Or you can walk around the table and have it proc once on each side, or run it in a tight circle and get it to proc quicker. 




 My guess is they are as close as it gets to "raw" upgrades in previous souls games, whereas, a nice flat damage bonus to a weapon would be worth more to a low stat character than a +%scaling weapon.

For example, my Level 4 beastbro would probably get more out of a gem with a flat 20-40 damage, rather than +15-20%, since his STR and SKL are like, 8 or 9 each, though, I haven't gotten any worthwhile flat damage gems yet in game to compare the differnces, as the really good ones are hard to get.

 Yeah, in general, I've found it to be less reliable for stun-locking enemies, but the 2h/transformed charged attack will send the lesser to regular to large enemies flying everytime, though the diagnal angle can make it a bit less user friendly than say the horizontal spin2win of the hunter's axe. 




 They are too loud and obnocious, just like the crows.  My issue is that I'm pretty sure there is little to no fade in these sound effects, so no matter how close or far I am from the mob, it sounds like they are screaming or barking in my ears at a gajillion decibals  




 Haha.  You've put together 1% of the story so far :D

Keep going.  There is so much more to it! 




 Yep.  That being said, I've had my fair share of, "Fuck those guys and their cheap ass frenzy mechanic!"


I do think frenzy could have been worked in better.  It should either do a large chunk of damage, but less than what it currently does, like 50-60% health tops, or keep it at 70% damage, but not let it kill you, so at most, it would reduce your HP to 1. 




 Wow.  That's crazy-awesome.  Good on your friend.  


Man, I never fight that thing head on simply due to the zero margin of error allowed fight for a cursed dungeon, plus, everytime I've ever tried to engage him close, he often chains his regular attack with a charge or leap at point blank, and dat hitbox gets me everytime from such a close range.   Guess I just need to git guuder.  Also, I don't play my Chikevyln too often, so that option of bone-marrow ashing the last large chunk of his health for safety and ease hasn't been an option :/ 




 Once you create a chalice, can you still join other glyphs even if you take that original chalice down?  I mean, I know you have to create the original chalice type to be able to join a glyph of the same dungeon type, but is that memory inherent in your game/character, or do you have to leave the original chalice up the whole time? 




 I hate them too, but they're not that cheap.  There are lots of tools to deal with them, including ranged weapons, sedatives, frenzy resist armor, and frenzy resist runes.


The brains are a prime example of what the souls games do best:  they put extreme pressure on players, intentionally inducing panic and "what the shit is going on?" confusion mode, which in turn causes players to panic, and thus not play as methodically and carefully as they must in a Souls game.


Like any other enemy or boss, if you approach them methodically and with patience and a level-head, they can be easily taken down, and create that satisfaction that the Souls games are known for. 




 But DaS2 was a B-Team thing, so I think it would be more likely to be seen in BB than DaS2, but still, I wouldn't necessarily count on it or expect it :D 




 Really?  I was never hit by any of his jump attacks ever, just by staying locked onto him, and dodging forward (to where he is diving from), right as he is diving, and thus, he winds up behind you, and you can just turn to face him and click to quick-turn the camera around to attack him again. 




 Comment so I can find this later.  Thanks for the links :D 




 They are awesome weapons. I find Ludwig's to be a bit dull, but the chikage is fun to play with, and to play against.

And Yes, rifle spear is OP, but only cuz it's broke as shit right now, an it's a shame because its such a fun weapon.  




 It's not OP, It's just plain bugged.  Ludwig and Chikage is OP, considering how easy and quick you can build a character to do top-shelf damage with those weapons, even with no depth 5 gem-farming. 




 Because reddit has the dumbest ranking system, and the arbitrary down-voting and upvoting system is totally horse shit, and just like any other form of trolling or bitching on the internet - it is unregulated and unchallenged and it doesn't really mean anything :D 




 Ha ha.  Wot a storee Mahrk! 




 Yeah, Yogg Saron was a long time ago... 




 That's so... gay? 




 Loran Darkbeast is fairly telegraphed and easy to dodge though once you figure it out, though his movesets are a lot more brutal than Paarl, and he can easily one shot you once he is fully charged and doing some of his bad ass moves.  Havne't gotten to Ebrietas on my level 4 beast-bro, as I have been mostly working on my beastbro, but my onebro runs are usually the last thing I do in a SOULS games once I am border-line done with it.  OH HAI COLLETE! 




 Are you gemming the burial blade correctly?  You can get an easy 650-750 AR with the correct gems, which are the +8-9% physical gems with the flat +70ish arcane damage.  The burial blade is bad-ass, it just takes longer to optimize since you have to farm depth 5 chalices, whereas, you can make your +10 chikage or +10 evelyn or +10 ludwig's bad-ass with minimal time and gem-farming investments, which is why it is the easy sort of go-to common-cheese builds :D 




 The burial blade is much harder to optimize than other weapons, as you need to get to lowest level chalice dungeons to obtain the odd gems that are like +9% physical and +70ish flat arcane damage.  Those gems are built for BoM and Burial Blade.  Furthermore, I think the best is the Uncanny Burial Blade, as it has a triangle gem slot so you can add another %physical damage +flat arcane gem, since most of the waning gems are crap for that setup. 




 Yeah, it's super easy to raise super-high with minimal stat and time investments too :/ 




 Yeah.  You have to master the camera adjustment of facing your character opposite direction, and tapping the right stick button to auto-orient your character with direction he is facing.  Next game:  Cameraborne, where the hardest enemy you fight is the camera, and they are all cameras.  Oh god.  I'm having PTSD flashbacks about the centipede demon in DaS.  WHY GWYNN WHY!?!!  YOU'RE TEARING ME APART LISA! 




 oh god, what an abomination! 




 Yeah, the "why" of most FROM games is seldom the point, or all that important.  It is a rash of people and characters dealing with the "what" of it, often futilely until the bitter end.  The point is, life is a bitch, then you die.  It's all so pointless.  Fuck it. 




 Stop spoiling your game play!  You only get one chance at a first time play-through, so drink every last drop of that coagulated menstrual blood and take your punishment! 




 Yep.  I killed him on another toon last night, and took me a few tries to readjust to the whole delayed movements and dodges.  But I totally enjoyed the waltz of it once I got the timing right again :D 




 If you are using BoM, stunlock her into a wall, a pillar, or just stun lock her period, as she will likely wind up pinned up against something in general.  If you have 15 arcane, you can use beast roar to make this fight even more trivial.  R1 spam your BoM until your stamina is gone, immediately use beast roar, then resume spamming, but don't give her a second to even begin attacking, or she might one or two shot you.  And if you can keep her pinned at the part where she imbues her weapon with fire, and don't let her complete the enchantment, she will spend the rest of the light trying to light her sword on fire, like some retarded child trying to light water on fire. 




 And if I open those, then all dungeons are open to me?  Because I thought I would be limited to only exact matches, ie., cursed, fetid loran = only cursed fetid loran 




 So if you make a dungeon with all offerings (ex, Isz root or loran root), then you can join any dungeon with any combination of those offerings?  Thanks. 




 There is no proof from what Micolash says that Rom was once human, and was turned into kin or anything else.  There is no way to prove what he says as literal, as it can just as well be taken in the same manner as someone saying "god gave birds wings so they could fly."  It doesn't mean god reached down and glued wings on ferrets and thus that is where birds came from, as if it was just a gift that was given, it just means, 'as they were made/created/evolved/born."  There is no concrete proof for either case, but I find it odd that every human character in game has a lot of screen time, dialogue, or info via item descriptions, yet there is nothing related to 'Rom the human' anywhere.  I don't think this is an oversight.  I think Rom is what he has always been, and whatever that may be, it never was human. 




 Ok. Cool. I think that will be a good go to spot to get guaranteed radial gems with minimal farming for my burial blade. Thank you.  




 The official guide. There have been a lot of posts listing pictures of the guide. Look up your primary weapons and the damage types and multipliers in those posts.  




 It depends. Flat physical affects all damage types (phys, thrust, blunt) but if you are primarily using blunt or thrust attacks, it might do you well to double check what other gems you can docket in there to maximize what attacks you use the most, especially since different attacks have different modifiers. It also depends if the enemy is open or not.  




 Another note:  40 dex is a shit ton of investment for a weapon that is best and meant to be utilized in 2handed Bloodtinge form - that is what you do your killing with, the R1's are just for transforming there and back to minimize the HP leak.  Chikage is not for a dex build, and you also lose out on Eve's damage with non hard-capped BT.  I would have gone to 20-25 skill max, and instead gone for 15 arcane for the hunter's tools, as beast roar is stupid OP and easy to stunlock people with (as well as your only parry type defense while using 2h stance, which is dangerous with only 26 vit), and maybe pumped vit to at least 30, especially if you are going to be invading people. 




 While fun to play (with and against), I'm sort of sad that the majority of my fights are against BT chikage/eves or Ludwigs :(


Makes me with there were more weapons in this game, or at least, more go to ridiculously powerful weapons, rather,  more viable and competitively powerful weapons, that are as easy to obtain and get the most out of them with minimal time investment and little to no farming.  I'm enjoying my burial blade build right now, but to get to the best gems for it, I have to run to the ends of the chalice dungeons and farm the lowest levels, as there are no +physical % damage +flat arcane anywhere in the main game or basic chalices, whereas you can put a few easy to obtain +18 to +20% gems in the chikage and call it a day 


edit:  specifics 




 I know a lot of people that need to revisit the past and learn how to spell :P 




 Doctor:  "Please point to the chart and tell me exactly how it is that you suck so much." 




 Don't forget the baby great ones or surrogates or whatever they are - all those little slug things that just stare longingly at the celestial garden/alter of despair. 




 Great write up, thank you, but due to the format of one of the first parts, can you please clarify that this info is correct:


*EDIT; If you want guaranteed radials with physical % and arcane add:*

*Glyph: ba362b97*

*Location: Phtumeru Ihyll root.*

*Rites: Cursed, Foetid, Rotten.*

*Unlock lever, and farm the brainsucker mob guarding the treasure chest in the t-room before the first boss. The best it can drop is a rating 17 gem, but its a guaranteed radial...*


That edit was for all the information below, right?  Also, do you know what the first boss of this dungeon is?  Ie., is the boss itself worth farming for gems too?  (I mean, you would have probably mentioned it if it was, but still worth asking)  Thanks.


edit:  grammar/clarity 




 Aside a bloodtinge build, which is this game's ranged build equivelent (which a FROM game should have), guns do little to minimal damage, especially on the later bosses who have a billion HP and can kill you in one or two hits, but I am wasting my breath, as you are either a retarded troll, one ignorant motherfucker, or just plain retarded, period. 




 Mr souls veteran here took 6 tries to kill cleric beast and 4 for papa G?  An easy boss is one you can kill in one or two tries, and you taking that many attempts is pathetic.  I killed cleric beast my first try and it took me two tries to kill Papa G in my very first NG cycle ever.  You sound like a noob, and a lot of your fellow newbs spend hours and days and weeks getting past these areas your having a hard time with. 




 The brain trusts always sing as far as I can tell. And the baby starts crying as soon as you beat rom. That beig said, no one has come up with a decent lore connection of the messengers and who what and why they are, and even more intriguing, no one has yet to adequately explain why Mind of Mensis and the Winterb Lantern's brain matter is made out of dead messengers  




 Dude. Beast roar is awesome. You can counter projectiles and knock lesser foes and bosses and PCs on their asses. I think I'm gonna put 15 arcane in all my builds from here on out. Fuck having 50 vitality :D 




 Parry or beast roar or use longer ranged weapons for those bitches. I dont get why people have such a huge problem with BoM. No worse than the spam fest that goes on with a lot of other weapons, and I happen to find BoM the easiest to counter :D 




 I still don't understand how the motion control crap works. Alls I know is I occasionally perform the most inopurtune gesture that you can't cancel easily like in DaS  




 Yeah. Unique and fun weapons like Dragon bone fist and majestic greatsword were fun to fuck around with too.  




 You mean Christians?  Sounds like Christians to me :D 




 Whoa... let me just adjust my in-foil hat for this one...and.... yes!  I totally agree!  He is in fact Laurence and imposter Isofeka and the blood minister from the beginning of the game all at once even! 




 Yeah, but pre DLC, you could aquire double digit slabs easy in the course of the main game, and once they released the expansions, you could swim in them.  Sure, you couldn't upgrade every weapon right away, but there were too many similar and samey weapons in that game anyhow. 




 Ha.  No sweat.  You had started off our earlier discussion fairly level headed, so I thought it was a bit strange that you were all-of-a-sudden throwing out completely irrelevant evidence and ideas :)


That being said, now I'm curious about this whole "gherman isn't gherman" thing, which, I think is a ridiculous idea and there is no reason or evidence to believe so, but still, I'm curious... 




 Ah, I've only seen a few gargoyles here or there in chalice dungeons, and no, never saw a chunk drop in there, but it's not like I farmed the gargoyles either :D 




 Wow.  Someone sure is feeling murderous today, huh? :D 




 Just wait for the next two bosses!  I'd rather fight 3 keepers at the same time over them!  The hot dog is one of the worst, but if you have the patience and are super careful, you can beat him really easily, you just can't really fuck it up at all, and either way, it will just take a long ass time.  As for the keeper, on my STR toon I just parried/visceraled her and duked it out old fashioned style, and on my SKL toon, I kept the keeper stun-locked with R1 spam from Blades of Mercy, then knocked her to the floor with beast-roar once I ran out of stamina, then I rinsed, and repeated till she died.  She escaped it once or twice and killed me once or twice, but I just whomped her that way for simplicity's sake  :D


Edit:  And your level is fine. 94 is plenty high to do any of the game. 




 I have yet to get a chunk in a dungeon, from a gargoyle enemy or anywhere else.  Can they be found in chests or on the ground or something in chalices?  Or just from enemies? 




 Those are two distinct differences though, as the imposter actually has dialogue and is voiced by two separate actors, whereas the apprentice only exists on an item description, so I fail to see the point of your reasoning?. 




 So you can dupe and glitch, but then you can't carry those characters forward and keep them?  That doesn't sound all that worth it :/ 




 I think it took me 4 or 5 vicerals to kill him in NG+ with the +30 and +20% visceral runes :D 




 There are plenty of one-offs and non-sequitters in these games.  Not everything is long and well-crafted and intertwined through the whole story.  This may or may not be one of those one-offs, but the point remains, it can be read and interpreted in either manner, with no concrete evidence favoring one over the other.  Read it as you choose. 




 Even if they are low level, at the least they probably have +9 or +10 weapons, with possibly the best gems farmed from chalice dungeons or late game, or maybe they've duped a zillion chunks and rocks (not sure if it works on gems).  This is why I said *'best to run to end game to make your toon more competitive in PvP,'* meaning, some of these people could have built these toons week 1 or 2 of BB's release (or even more recently), and they have had many days and weeks on their characters to farm for better gems and fully upgrade all their primary gear to +9 or +10, on top of finding the best gems.  (Also, they might have their gems, weapons and builds better itemized than you).


Edit:  Like the guy above said, I've "speed ran" my three PvP toons to end game to have decent gems and all primary weapons at +9 or +10, and I'm still clearing out chalices on a few of them.  And by speed-run, I mean, it only takes a night or two of gamplay to get the runes, the levels, and the primary weapons I need to +9 or +10, and to pretty much be at end game, and have my toon where he can hold his own.


Edit 2:  As for your damage, double check with the guide to make sure you are gemming your weapon properly.  Ie., you might be gemming your hunter's axe for pure physical damage, yet, only most of the weaker, 1H attacks are physical damage for the HA, where all the 2h heavy attacks are calculated as blunt damage.  Thus, if you gem the hunter's axe for all physical damage, but only use heavy blunt 2h attacks, then you are heavily crippling your potential damage output. 




 And the saves will be compatible?  1.0 will run the current characters from 2.0 or whatever the current build is?  And then once you upgrade the current build will be comptaible with your characters you took from 2.0 to 1.0?  If so, hell yeah!


 




 Fast track was Isofeka's clinic glitch, but I heard they fixed that, which is kinda obnoxious if you've already leveled a toon or two normally and want to create some different builds to get into PvP ASAP and stay competitive in PvP.  My one regret is I didn't level up an arcane and a quality toon while that was still available.


I'd say your best bet is to play the game through towards end game as normal so you can get enough upgrade materials and ruins to make the build you want and stay competitive - and it shouldn't take that long as the game is super short, especially once you are more familiar with it.  You could also create a totally viable and competitive PvP build at level 60-90 with decent gear and a +8 or 9 main weapon with minimal time investment, but it depends on what you are looking for.  Back to the first point - playing through the main game will also give you some practice since you might be playing with weapons and items you aren't familiar with (ie., going from a main STR build to a PvP BT or SKL build).  A lot of people insist on 50 vitality as a must for all PvP toons due to the invader 30% health debuff, and while it almost helps in making up for that stupid handicap, it isn't necessary, though I do notice I tend to win more when I'm the one being invaded, and not doing the invading.  All that being said, you don't need to min-max in this game to be successful.  As with all the souls games, superior individual player skill will always win out over superior items, upgrades, runes, and so forth.  Good luck to you~ 




 Well, there are a lot less things to upgrade in BB, but at least slabs were super common in DaS2, and chunks could eventually be purchased, and twinklings and dragon bones (the hardest to collect en masse) were super easy and quick to farm too, especially once you got to the late game, and they were at least guaranteed spawns.  Like farming in any game, it is a pretty obnoxious time sink and poor design imo, but it is and was still better than upgrade item availability in BB  :/ 




 To be fair. BSB's poison AIDS is no joke. And you're probably not too terrible if you made it to BSB period. Yes te game game gets harder, but you will likely become better at it. Take a break and come back later. Sometimes that's all you need for these games :D 




 Not really. It is just subtle and cryptic, which FROM does quite often and quite well.  




 Well, he never really befriends you, he just doesn't try to kill you. But yes, you can still talk to him so long as you enter old yharnam through the back route. But be careful, I don't know if killing the hunter below makes him permanently hostile or not, so don't engage either in combat. Just come back later after you've unlocked the short cuts an you can make your way up all those ladders to talk to him.  




 Hehe.  Bet it sucked to be him! 




 Thanks for the info.  I was just looking at the game on steam, and it seems smarter to pay 20 dollars to upgrade DaS2 on the Pc, rather than having to pay full price for SoTFF elsewhere :D 




 Hey all.  I've been lost in Bloodborne since release (which I bought a PS4 for), and I have been thoroughly enjoying both the PvE and the PvP, but I did want to eventually pick up SoTFF.  I played the hell out of DaS2 on PC, and while part of me doesn't want to pay for the same game again, I was curious what my fellow hardcore Souls fans thought of SoTFF, as well as if anyone had some ideas as to which system it plays best on?  Or what the main differences are, as I've read the graphics were over-hauled for both PC and console versions.  (For reference, I have a PS4 and a PC to choose from, no XBox1)


That being said, how is the funcionality of the different systems?  I prefer to game on PC, because my PC performs better than the PS4, better graphics, I like keyboards, etc (though I still play Souls games with a controller), but I heard that the console versions can support up to six persons in a multiplayer game?  But the PC release doesn't?  Any other big differences like that between them?


And in general, what have you guys thought of SoTFF so far?  Is it true that SoTFF comes with all three DLC's?  Thanks in advance for your responses  :) 




 Again, it is very well-written, and one of the most beautiful gems in the whole of the first game was the easy-to-miss, right-under-your-nose hint dropped in your first NPC encounter of the game:


Oscar the Fateless straight up says, "...Regrettably, I have failed in my mission... *But perhaps you can keep the torch lit...* There is an old saying in my family... Thou who art Undead, art chosen..."


The whole "keep the torch lit" is a direct reference to the kiln of the first flame, and yet, you would have never known it your first time through, and even on subsequent play-throughs, it is absolutely easy to miss this tasty and subtle reference.  Again, that's good writing  :D 




 Right, which would likely be a bastardized, incestuous dose of the Queen's blood.


Did you ever play Dark Souls?  There is an exact similar situation at the beginning of that game, where FROM does the exact same thing - they allude to a very specific piece of information that you would just never understand or 'get' on your first play through (or ever for that matter if you are inattentive).  I don't want to say it in case you've never played it cuz spoilers... 




 I like how literal and hidden in plain-sight you can take the translation. That blood in the beginning?


"Where's an outsider like you to start?  With a little bit of *Yharnam* blood of your own."  


He could be literally injecting you with queen Yharnam's blood. And yes, I suppose it could be menstrul blood, or from the afterbirth.  




 Bingo. I just posted this a little while ago:


Ah, but you are just reading it a particular way:  "Bone of an old hunter whose name is lost."  It doesn't say "bone that *came from* and old hunter whose name is lost."  While there are thigs to be lost and found in translation, that is still a massive difference in language use. The item description clearly tells us the one who used it was an apprentice of Gherman, but it does not clearly say where it comes from. Think about that :D

 Yep. And to be honest, I don't really care for the different physical attack values, but maybe there was good reason for it. If all attacks were just physical, they probably would have had to tone every weapon down to do less damage.  




 That, and it wouldn't make sense to have blunt/thrust go through a double dip for damage mitigation. It would essentially mean all thrust and blunt stacks would be weaker due to stacking defense types, which would be quite retarded.  




 Honestly, FROM has been a revitalizing force in what has been the stagnant industry of gaming, aside the already well established formulas, and the one offs and innovative indie studios. 


I warn you - if you pick up bloodborne, it will likely ruin gaming for you, and if you play the previous souls titles, every other game will feel like hello kitty island adventure where you run around with a bunch of school girls slapping each other with wet noodles, and hardly any game out there will even come close to the satisfaction, risk, reward, and enjoyment of playing a game made by FROM Soft...


You have been warned.  




 That is a very keen connection, and a very cool theory. Can we run with that? 




 Yeah. I'm too used to playing with the sweeping motion of the larger weapons too, so the spread just seemed unnecessary for me I suppose.  




 Right. They seem to recover a bit quicker, but you can spam it again in a split second if you so choose anyhow. Again. Personal preference I guess. I don't like the way the shotguns handle :D 




 Not to split hairs, but "It was said" and "He was" are two very difference ways of saying something.  But now that you have me thinking about it, the only other hunter in game we encounter who uses quickening (if I'm not mistaken) is the Chikage hunter in the grand cathedral.  Do you think that is the same apprentice that is mentioned int he description of the old bone?  I know the guide calls him "The cainhurst crow" or whatever, but it still gives us nothing definitive...  




 Whoa, slow it down professor!  Are you sure?  Let me write this down. 




 At point blank they can do some damage, but pistols stagger beasts just the same as the shotguns.  The shotguns have a wider arc, which just seems to promote sloppy play, and why bother with a pellet spread when you can swing a wide weapon like the axe or scythe or sword and stagger a group of enemies just the same, or use a beast roar, or throw a molotov or any number of options that actually do more damage or provide you with more utility.  I just tend to find that nearly every other item/weapon in the game has better utility than the shotguns, the exception being the rifle spear, because it allows you to parry while 2handing a transformed weapon.  Again, this is my personal preference and play-style, and I was over-all kind of dissapointed that the shotguns didn't have a more unique and effective usage. 




 The repeater pistol outdamages Eveylyn at high Blood tinge, but that is because it fires two bullets, and you go through your resources faster that way.  Being that it can be easy to miss with bullets, I found Eve to be the better choice, as it is accurate and fires fast, and other than having fun playing with the rifle spear (non-bugged version), I've found absolutely no real use for the pellet spread of the blunderbuss or shotgun type weapons.  Sure, it is supposed to do damage, but that damage is negligible outside of a blood tinge build (especially in NG+ cycles, depth 5 chalices, etc), since your focus isn't on playing a ranged build.  


That being said, is this for PvP or PvE?  Because I've found no reason to use anything but the hunter's pistol for non Blood-Tinge builds in PvE.  The pistol fires fast, is accurate, and you can shoot enemies at point blank (unlike the Eve which is too long, and will often shoot past enemies or other players at point blank range).  There is the blunderbuss, but I found it to be slow, clunky, and the damage it does in no way justifies how it leaves you more open to attacks on account of how slow it is.  Then there is the repeating pistol, which does more damage, but that is only because it uses twice the resources.  If you are thinking about the damage your guns can do, it doesn't really matter as much when you're not a BT build.  It's about utility and it becomes more of a personal preference or what you think is fun and stylish, though I can't speak about ludwig's holy rifle and the modifier of holy damage, as I don't know that much about it.


As for other reasons to increase your gun damage, sure, occasionally an enemy will have a slice of HP left after a fight, and it can be convenient to shoot them once or twice to kill them, but again, it isn't needed or warranted if that's not how you've dedicated your build, though it depends on your playstyle.


At the end of the day, weapon damage in the souls games comes down to the conservation of movements.  Take for example an enemy that has 3000 health, be it PC or NPC.  Let's say you set out to kill it with three gunshots leading into three visceral attacks.  If your gun does 200 points of damage, and your visceral attacks do 800 points of damage, then you kill the enemy in those six moves:  gun shot parry+visceral, gun shot parry+visceral, and one more gun shot parry+visceral for a total of 3000 damage.  The enemy is now dead.


Then let's say you decide to pump your bloodtinge, so your gun shots now do 250 damage (up from 200).  It might seem handy or helpful to have that little extra damage, as sometimes we do find ourselves dying in a situation where an enemy only has a tiny slice of life left and one more gunshot would kill it, but the fact remains that in the same scenario above, it doesn't change the amount of attacks it takes to kill an enemy:

1st parry+visceral = 1,050 damage - enemy has 1950 HP left now

2nd parry+visceral = 1,050 damage - enemy now has 900 health left

3rd parry+visceral - 1,050 damage - enemy is now dead, but the damage added through pumping another 10-20 points in BT is negligible, because he would have been dead anyway, and thus you wasted points in BT.


I know people can argue any number of ways on this, but imo BT and gun damage is useless outside dedicated builds, and thus the weapon you use is a matter of personal preference, be it for effectiveness, feel, or style, and I've just found the regular old Hunter's Pistol to be too damn awesome and reliable to not use, and it is easy enough to get it to +9 (along with your other favorite weapons) to where you can use it as viable damage output should you find yourself facing off with an enemy who winds up with a tiny sliver of health left (though less so in depth 5 chalices and higher NG+ cycles).  Hope this helps, now go hunt in style!  o/


edit:  grammar/clarity

Edit 2:  Back to the reliability of the pistol - it staggers enemies just the same as the blunderbuss, but it is just faster and super accurate :D
 




 Unless you're going full or super-high BT build, I wouldn't bother with Evelyn, as the Hunter's Pistol is on par for damage with it until like, early 20's bloodtinge.  And if you are going to invest that much in BT (Eve requires 18 I think, which is a lot for non-primary damage), and you don't pump it up more to use a chikage, you are pretty much gimping what could otherwise be a higher damage, more focused skill build, or wasting what could be a full (40-50) bloodtinge build with a good 20-25 in skill, utilizing your stats best with chikage as your main weapon and eve for damage and utility.  


If you want or care to do actual damage with your firearm, yes, I'd say go full BT or a skill/BT build with eve and/or rifle spear and chikage, but if you are just using firearms for utility, then waste as few possible points in BT as you can get away with:D 




 Would love to spar sometime this weekend.  I have 3 semi-complete PvP builds that are staying around level 90-98, but I'm not sure of the best way to do so in this game since there are no soap stones, and passwords don't affect PvP. I imagine the best way to do it is by grabbing the first root chalice available and using that glyph. What do you think?


Edit:  not sure I I'll have the time to grind out the chalices on all/any of my PvP toons just yet, as I'm pretty sure the hunter tombs key chalice is required for chalice PvP 




 I'm not seeing it. Also, I'd likely suspect lag as being the culprit :D 




 I think the final allure in this game (like the other souls titles) is PvP, and challenge runs. Ie, like someone below said, it isn't about just getting gear. It is about the challenge itself, such as the triple offering dungeons 




 Stun lock on lesser foes. You should be able to own most enemies in les than 1 bar of stamina, and for total pwnage, for a measly total 15 points of investment in arcane, you spam until your stamina is gone, then use beast roar ASAP to knock them over, and by the time the enemy stands up again, you should have enough stamina back to rinse and repeat. 


For multiple enemies, I'd suggest either playing unlocked for quick turning to be able to stab whoever is coming at you, or be quick to flick the lock on to whoever gets closest, enabling you to still spam constantly without getting swarmed, though with how bad the camera can be at times, it might get you killed until you are more accustomed to it. 


Eit:  I hate using BoM for PvP though. Sure, im not practices enough with them in PvP to really speak to their power, but Between the lack of range and the latency of multiplayer, I can't stand using them against other players :D 




 Tots casul troll. But the point remains. She is an way boss. 


Edit:  just realized he said no heal run. That's insane. I'm pretty far on my level 4bro that I don't play too often, but I imagine i'd get quite sick of an angry at the game if I tried that.  




 I either stockpile them early to get a few levels, save them for when I want to splurge on consumables, or use them to push me over the edge to be able to level later in the game.  As for the mad-men's wisdoms, I wouldn't use those until you need them, since a brain-sucker might steal them, and there is no shortage of insight in the game.  I tend to use insight/wisdoms to purchase armors and crafting materials at the insight vendor. 




 Dude, if you're anything like me, you hate the cane.  The poke/poke of the cane is fun and effective, but the whip is slow, and does low damage, and pretty much every other weapon with a little bit of reach (ie, wide slahes of rifle spear) do a better job of staggering or knocking over enemies and doing crowd control.  The cane has a certain cool factor to it, especially when imbued with fire as it looks amazing, but I found it to be far too weak, and slow as shit in whip mode, and it seems to be outclassed by every other longer-ranged weapon in game, particularly the axe or burial blade.  I didn't do a whole playthrough with rifle-spear, but I did play through half the game with it, but it was one of my favorite and most fun weapons to play with, though it was a bit weak compared to the damage I could do with some of the other weapons (and no, I'm not talking +flat arcane bug).  It just depends on what movesets and abilities you like. 
























 So sarcastic and passive aggressive. You must have a really well-groomed vagina. You sorry saps are doing this to yourself, bitching like a bunch of children. I'm just calling it like I see it, but hey, if you want to join in the circle-jerk of useless whining, be my guest. Not mine or any other man'd fault that you feel inferior. Here's a tip though - doing this dear diary high-school shit on reddit isn't going to help you feel better about yourself or life here on planet-motherfucker. Good luck. I hope you can work through your neuroses and emotional problems. Be a real women or man, and face up to that shit. No one wants to deal with an adult child.  




 Clearly you didn't read what I wrote. It's ok though. I'm sure commiserating with your fellow hens in the sewing circle has elevated you oh so much in their eyes, and has contributed much to your well-being, never mind how pathetic this drivel sounds, and how it benefits neither sexes, nor does anything to demonstrate emotional maturity in a man. Most of you sound like chicks bitching about your so-called friends because you are too afraid to confront them, and you aren't man enough to deal with your own feelings, whatever that may entail. Frankly, it's pathetic and disgusting. Thank gosh for te anonymity of the Internet.  




 This post is retarded.  It's cancer.  What are we, a bunch of catty hens who are low on the pecking order?  Do you guys not have balls?  Do you feel the need to hate on your fellow man to elevate yourself, as if you're some chick in the sewing circle?


I hate people who answer and thus give credence to this sort of trash, and what I hate are the obnoxious and stupid characteristics that are common in most people, sexes be damned. 




 Yep, but I hear you on the spelling/attention thing.  But even in professional fields, the standards of grammar and even things like basic sentence structure and all manners of other elements have gone to complete shit, or at least it seems that way sometimes.  Attention to details are important, and it never ceases to amaze me how many people don't pay attention, be it on their resumes, their e-mails, their text messages, or to their own goddamn life and what they are feeling and how they deal with it, period  :D


Keep up the good fight though.  I myself would allow for no more than one, two typos max on a resume ;) 




 Honestly, nothing. Men are pretty damn great. Namely, what I hate are characteristics that are common in most people, namely stupidity, willful ignorance, solopsism, and unnecessarilly catty bull-shit like this stupid post.


What I'm saying is, I hate the kind of douche-bag that would answer this, like he's some lost fucking hen who is quite low in the pecking order. The emotionally retarded and immature type of people who aren't man enough to deal with their own feelings, whatever that entails.


Honestly - what are we here?  A bunch of fucking women?


Edit:  seriously. Fuck this post.  It's cancer.  




 But there are so many, with so many nuances, that's why people specialize in just one field of it, and are hired to exploit the system and find loop-holes in said system... 




 But can't we all just get along?  Treat everyone the way you want to be treated!  Ad nauseum! 




 Either way, this is totally exciting me! 




 Awww, you didn't hire him?  But what forethought and clarity of purpose!  He would have surely been a great asset to your team! 




 Fuck yeah!  Kim is one of my fav porn stars! 




 You nailed a good few of them.  I'd add Whitney Cummings, and about most of the other American female comedians out there, among a bunch of the guys as well :D 




 You have good taste my friend.  May you be blessed by Patton Oswalt and his over-rated fat-ass being hit by Whitney Cummings plane as it crashes down from the sky. 




 I love that guy, but there was a point in one of his own specials where he even seemed to be sick or tired of working that schtick.  His broader, farther-reaching bits about humanity, social interaction, human connectivity, and the paints of being a parent are all solid and hillarious though.  Worth noting, saw him live, and with not much material on the former, he was fucking hillarious.  Probably the hardest I've ever laughed in my life :D 




 Not just that, but she's super fucking lame and her material is absolute shit...   




 He is/was a comedian? :P 




 Don't forget a lot of American female comedians as well...  they're just...not funny. 




 Eh, if popculture and Itunes have taught us anything, it's never underestimate the public's ability to gulp down copious amounts of shit-stained swill.  I wouldn't bet on it. 




 Your tub!?  That's her tub too buddy! 




 But he was doing you a favor? 




 What a great way to attract talent!  Don't mind the colorful language and boob-grabbing! 




 So many crushed dreams, so many idiots... 




 Was he qualified?  I mean, while I can appreciate cheekiness on either side of the table, it seems a lot of arbitrary standards, bias, opinions, and negative experiences and conditioning get in the way of the interview process, which sort of makes you sound like an ass-hole :D 




 Book smart?  That's just a term stupid people use to justify their lack of smarts :D 




 But look at her willingness to do dirty jobs and take on huge problems that are seemingly impossible to her!  Clearly she would have been an all-star employee!  Tell me you hired her! 




 But, if you had a sense of humor, would you have hired him?  :P 




 Cuz hell yeah for teen pregnancy and shitty, immature parents :D 




 They had their eyes on the prize!  Clearly they were a focused individual!  How could you not hire them!? 




 Dude!  How could you not have hired him?  Clearly he shows creativity and innovation when it comes to solving problems!  As for the rest?  Well, he doesn't give a fuck! 




 It sure seems there are a lot of stupid, ignorant, strange, and lazy people on the interviewee side of the table, but I'd like to hear about the idiots on the other side.  Thanks in advance for your replies :) 




 Well, I can't speak on that, but if you're posting related materials/comments in perfectly suitable posts and sub-forums, then the moderators have no business perma-banning someone.  Judging by the way they are quick to ban people for seemingly no good reason without giving said people a chance to explain anything (as if it should be needed in some of these cases), I'd say they have itchy trigger-fingers. 




 Whoa...just, whoa... on all of that D: 




 Such dedication though! 




 Project 1999 as a game is pretty great, but Honestly, whoever regulates those forums seem to be completely humorless and unaware of appropriate context and forum topics. I was banned within a few hours of posting a few comments that were completely in-line and relevant to the topics I was replying too. It seems they are power-hungry control freaks who have a hard time understanding people, language, context, etc. don't take it personally, but that forum is kinda fucking stupid :) 




 What if he really is the best - and you missed out on an opportunity to hire an amazing worker?


That being said, yes, he sounds like a dick, but I love how little nuances and things that those who are hiring choose to take offense at are so subjective and dependent on their own experiences and bias.  I wonder how many people who would be perfect fits at certain jobs and companies wind up being passed over because the hiring manager/HR/boss/whatever chose something asinine to be annoyed at, or projected their own personal issues onto the hiree  :D 




 Wow...  just wow.  Couldn't you have told them both to get off the planet period, and fired them from their sorry attempts at being human beings?  You would have done us all a great favor  :D 




 Hey, you'd be upset too if you had semen in your eye! 




 Bwahahahaha.  Simpsons did it first anyhow.  Your day:  0  Me:  1 




 That's what he gets for trying to steal your TV!

 I'd opt for less vitality and go for 15 arcane, as the hunter's tools are awesome for PvP and PvE (specially beast roar), as well as a bit more skill.  




 Perfect for costume parties, or murdering people in the early AM hours of the morning!  Absolutely frightening! 




 Yeah, I just noticed that yesterday as a matter of fact - yes they are.  From the side-views of those attack animations you can see them fairly clearly and easily.  Between that, and the wintern lanters' brains being composed of seemingly dead messengers, it seems that a lot of the nightmare creatures are somehow made out of twisted/perverted messengers, which leads me to believe the messengers are messengers of the MP or some other great one, and since the great ones seem to have different methods and goals, that the Mensis school likely experimented or flat out somehow enslaved and warped some of the messengers, somehow. 




 TIL that god is an asshole that likes to destroy churches.  Consequently, TIL to stay the hell out of churches. 




 TIL that Muslims who don't even live in the middle east are still simple-minded, short-sighted, self-centered assholes with stupid concerns and beliefs. 




 Wow.  What a bunch of presumptuous assholes of so-called friends.  You don't need stupid people like that in your life.  That being said, stop trying to buy/impress friends in that manner. 




 Wait, what?  What bridge wolves?

 It looks like full metal alchemist meets dead space meets bloodborne? :D 




 Actually, no.  I was much more specific than you, namely in regards to maximizing the potential of the physical/arcane split weapons.  But, you're welcome.  BLEAAAAAAAAAARGHEEVOMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITREGURGITATIONEBLEAAAAAAARGH! 




 24 Episodes is fine with me for any series, really.  I mean, especially the way anime tends to draw itself out and all :D

Will definitely check this out. 




 Uuuuh, what show is that?  I need to watch it! 




 Those split arcane weapons are not meant to be optimized via the arcane stat, they are meant to be maxed via the +% physical and flat arcane damage gems, as their base arcane damage is super low.


That being said, it isn't awkward, you just have to have the uncanny burial blade (cuz the regular one with waning gem slot sucks), and you can take that AR upwards of 600 relatively easy, and that is with regular depth 5 chalice drops, not the more rarer, top-of-the-line rank 20 gems or abysmal gems from bosses.  The BoM are even more OP with those odd gems, because it hits like a truck, and it hits super fast.


That being said, the problem is, it is way more work and effort to do all that, rather than say, get a ludwigs which is basically OP out the gate, even with mediocre % physical gems on it.  Plus, it can be enchanted.  This is why everyone likes and uses ludwigs - because it is easy to obtain, and easy to increase the damage with little to no chalice farming or work.  It's a total bummer that certain builds and weapons in this game are so lop-sided when it comes to optimizing them and staying competitive :( 




 Riflespear is fun as shit to play with, but it is very mediocre in damage, hell, even reach, unless you are talking about the riflespear bug, which is bad to base a more permanent build around, since it will likely be fixed via patch soon enough.  I used the riflespear exclusively on my BT and SKL build characters until I obtained better weapons in late game (cuz I hate the cane), and again, while distinct and fun, the riflespear is easily outclassed in both range and damage by the axe, or ludwigs, and most anything else.  That, and if you are talking about the riflespear bug, it will likely take him awhile to get to a place to farm the correct gems to make it bugged/OP. 




 Right. And the arcane scaling on the split weapons is shit and not meant to be optimized via the arcane stat, and you gimp the split weapons if you only put %physical gems on them as well.  those weapons are meant to be boosted using the gems I mentioned, as the arcane stat itself makes almost no difference on them. 

The split weapons aren't suppose to be turned into pure arcane either, because they have low base arcane damage and scaling in the first place, and wind up just as gimpy if you try to use them that way. 

Edit:  the tonitrus is optimized via elemental damage gems, which are a lot harder to farm. Or at least, more obnoxious. 


Edit 2:  to be clear, I'm trying to tell you why those split weapons are the way they are, and how an and how to properly utilize their stats.  




 Actually, the corect gems for BoM and Burial blade are the +phys % and +flat arcane.  You can make your Burial blade 600+ AR easily this way, and same thing with BoM.  That is how those should be gemmed correctly. 




 I got the perfect build for you.  It's bad-ass, sturdy, gives you access to all those tools you mentioned, and you can make several weapons ridiculously OP (though for burial blade, you need to get the uncanny version to be able to put in all +phys % gems and flat arcane damage, as the waning gem slots suck ass).  That being said, Rosmarinus wouldn't be the focus here, as you will top off at 15 arcane, though you could move the stats around, but 25 end is good to be able to use the different weapon combos out there.  Anyway, here is the awesome OP build that makes you shine for quality weapons and SKL weapons, but you could also viably use some STR weapons just for the hell of it if you didnt want to be too op:

40 Vit

25 End

25 STR

50 SKL

5 BT - dont add any into this, as you don't need it for anything, and fuck anything other than hunter's pistol anyhow for non BT builds :P

15 ARC


There is your 110 build if you start with Cruel Fate (has only 5 blood tinge).  You can adjust the Vit/end/SKL to your liking, but with this build and the correct weapons and gems, you can have a 650-700 AR Burial Blade, a 600 AR BoM, and a 850-950 AR Ludwig's (stupid, right?) with the phantasm shell.  Have fun!


Edit:  Thanks to my mate here on reddit who showed me how ridiculously awesome this quality build is :D

 




 He is the only truly altruistic character in the story, and he says as much, dialogue along the lines of "I only wanted to help," and something about his family telling him he was wrong.  He is just a genuinely friendly, creepy, dude. 




 Which is a shame, cuz it's a fun weapon to use.  I used it exclusively until I got the burial blade and BoM on my skill build, cuz I hate the cane  




 How many hundreds of hours did you play DaS2?  :P


Funny, for being such a terrible game, all the FROM fans still played it more than any other game out there.  The best way to put it is, DaS2 is a fantastic RPG game, but it is not a fantastic FROM game :D 




 It looked pretty damn good on my PC.  That being said, what all the DaS2 whiners meant (even after they played the game for hundreds and thousands of hours, and ejoyed it) is, DaS2 is a fantastic RPG game, and it was still game of the year in 2014, but it is the least souls-like of the souls games.  It is a great RPG game, just not a great FROM game :D 




 Fuck all the whiners.  They still played it more than any other game out there, they still put 100's to 1000's of hours on it, and it was still the best game of 2014, hands down.  No other game, even AAA, had the same replayability and diversity DaS2 had, especially for PvP.  I love how people will say, "it's a terrible game, I only played it for 1000 hours"...  like, really?  What the fuck dude?  


But I get what they mean.  What all the DaS2 whiners are trying to say (and the best way to put it is), DaS2 is the best RPG game of all the Souls games, but it is the least Souls-like of all the souls games, or at least, the most deficient of the souls games when it comes to all the little quirks and nuances that made the souls games great.


That being said, DaS2 easily has the best PvP and matchmaking of all the games (aside soul memory), and definitely has the best variety in terms of weapons/armor (even if it is redundant), but even that is great, as the fashion options are spectacular! 




 Hahaha.  Yep.  when I think Oedipus complex, I think of children wanting to bang their mothers... 




 LOL 




 I hope they do fix it, as I love this wepaon and find it very fun to play with it, even though without the bug, it is kinda weak compared to other weapons, it can still be pimped out quite nicely :D


That being said, like any other obviously OP or broken shit, I don't see it as a matter of will they fix it, but when will they fix it?  :D 




 Haha.  He sucked and died, in that order :D 




 The DLC in DaS was cut content that they just didn't have time to put in the original game, and that content was fantastic and worth it's entertainment dollar a hundred times over.  The DLC in DaS2 went hand-in-hand with the story, but I still think it was more of an after-thought (or at least, not like it was going to be implemented in original game), BUT, the DLC for DaS2 was the highlight of the game, with some of the best game-design and challenging bosses and some great new items and weapons.


The point is, I will buy DLC for Bloodborne in a heart-beat, whether it was intended content that was cut due to time-constraints, or an after-thought :D 




 Yeah - I hear ya on the checklist thing.  After a while it becomes mechanical, especially when you've done them on more than one character.  I actually enjoy creating my own due to the mystery of them, or trying out other people's glyphs, but the story-line chalices became redundant the second time around.  At the least, I would have enjoyed some different tile sets and lay-outs, or even more interesting would have been a wave-like enemy arena or boss challenge.  I think that would have fit just fine into the game, and really showcase the enemies as well as the player characters :D 




 So OP! 




 There is an enemy in the guide called "Izzy's admirer," though I can't remember who it was for.  I think it was an NPC hunter... 




 On my first NG ever I was able to stunlock him to death with a hunter's axe and 20 stamina.  I dont think he even had a chance to attack.  Same thing went on my BoM run.  Guy is ridiculously easy and under-powered, especially for being such a burly looking monster.  I wish he was as challenging as he looks :/ 




 Really?  I didn't know you could die to this guy?  Not trying to be a smart-ass, but I thought this was a terrible boss fight due to how easy he is.  Seriously, if you just look at him he becomes stunlocked :D
 




 I still felt bad killing her.  Even as a beast, she is kinda pretty and majestic.  Also, feel free to use "Ron the Funky Caterpillar" too :D 




 There should be a "you're gonna die," emote, or at the least, something like "careful, this aint NG" :D 




 Yep.  To me she is the Reindeer Beast of Christmas Past :D 




 Bingo. My guess is they'd need a larger amount of time to change it more than they did in making the gameplay swifter, yet still weighty. I love the game as well, and the only bad part is that the superb level design hides how short the game really is. Chalice dungeons are pretty cool, and a great feature overall, but I just wish they had time for more tile sets :D 




 Yes, for other content, not game-changing mechanics.  Don't start the blind hype-train all over again... 




 I agree for the most part, and fuck all that blind-hype-train crap people got all worked up over anyhow.  Disapointment is what happens when you have blind, unfounded expectations.  A lot of it seemed too complicated and convoluted and exclusive anyhow.


That being said, decent covenants with a a slight modicum of depth would have been welcome, but as it stands, the covenants in BB are the lamest and most shallow to date.  The covenants in previous games all had motives, rewards, and mechanics related to them, and BB pretty much completely lacks that.  For that and mainly that, I am dissapointed :( 




 What's that you say?  You miss losing more and more of your HP meter like in Dark Souls 2?  :D 




 Yep.  And that dissapointment is what people get for hopping on the blind-ass hype-train.  Don't know why people chose to believe in that shit and actually put their expectations on it in the first place :/ 




 Well, as far as I can tell, that was all speculation, and people blindly got on the hype-train, and surprise surprise when FROM didn't have some sort of in-depth transformation mechanic and covenant system, especially to the degrees that players expected it.  


And it's funny that people somehow expected these crazy covenants and transformations and blood mechanics, yet what we wound up is the most hands-off, lamest, shallow and bland covenant systemto date :/


All that being said, it's still the best game of 2015 so far, and likely will stay that way, and hey, at least Play Station 4 has one good game on it :) 




 Eh, that's what happens when people got on the speculation hype-train with no proof.  Even if those were the original ideas (which I don't think they were) it would have probably been far too ambitious, and be super hard to balance, and who needs balance when you have ludwig's holy blade anyhow? :D 




 My thoughts:  if that was indeed the case and the idea (as I thought all that was just speculation, and not actually from FROMsoft), it was probably too ambitious, and they had to simplify it quite a bit :/ 




 You're welcome.  Have fun :D 




 You can't just create any random dungeon glyph (even with all necessary materials) unless you've already created a dungeon of that specification.  So if you wanted to make a 'cursed ihyll' of a specific glyph, you first have to make a 'cursed ihyll' of your own.  


Provided you have all the materials you need, you go to a blank gravestone, use 'condust chalice ritual,' option, and make the parent dungeon.  Once that dungeon is created, then you can go to another gravestone and then you can use the 'find glyph' option or whatever it's called to look up the specific dungeon you wanted to run, and you can create it, all without having to use your own materials.


So, if you wanted to run a specific 'cursed loran' glyph, you couldnt create a 'cursed isz' dungeon and expect to access cursed loran, but if you did create a cursed isz dungeon of your own, you could access any cursed isz chalice glyph out there by looking it up the same way mentioned above via glyphs.


Lastly, supposedly if you create a parent dungeon of your own, with all offerings, you can access any and ALL combination of those offerings via glyphs.  So if you created a cursed/fettid/rotten Ihyll, you could join any ihyl glyph, even if it was only 'cursed and fettid.'


Good luck~ 




 Have you created a chalice with those specifications already (ie, cursed/fetid/rotten)?  You have to create a chalice of that type already first, and then you can pull up the glyphs that fall under it, without having to spend your own chalice materials. 




 Yeah. Tiny tonitrus us can be pretty color though, and te cheap 15 ones (shell and paw) are definitely worth it.  




 Or how complicated the races and their primarily religious emotions and other factors are :/ 




 Have you ever been to jail?  All these tough ass motherfuckers for all their street cred who act like bad-asses immediately start bitching to their baby-sitters, the deputies, saying shit like,

"I need a band-aid"


"I need to be taken out of general because I stubbed my toe"


"I need to schedule a doctor's appointment because I spilled my milk"


I dont say this to justify the negligence on behalf of the cops, but put yourself in their shoes for a second and know that they hear all these tough guys who cop to their crimes to their fellow thugs turn into instant pussies as they try to escape the consequences of their actions, and it happens everyday, all the time.  And of course, for the street-cred, they did it, but to the cops and authority figures, they are all innocent! 




 Yep. These open-minded, sheltered kids love to tell you to be open-minded and not racist from the safety of the ivory towers their parents paid for :D 




 Yep. It shows as much as its fatally-flawed idealistic, white-bred, well-funded, open minded liberal hipster yuppie bull-shit does. Respect people, for they are equal, I say from my sheltered, ivory tower that my parents paid for.  




 Racism itself is as old as man himself. Reddit is not classical. It is new, and racism is not unique to reddit... 




 We still calling them protestors?  Lets go even further PC with it and call them 'disadvantaged urban socio-economically oppressed urban societal victims.' 




 Yep. Maybe they chose that since arcane gives you more ranged attacks with the hunter's tools?  Either way. I don't like it. Optimizing builds shouldn't be so lop-sided - easy for physical, obnoxious and redundant for most everything else.  It should be equally challenging/easy/hard/redundant.  




 Ah, that's why.  I've only completed the glyphs I've done with two of the three rites.  I think I've yet to complete a depth 5 with all three rites (as I've just used them for farming regular gems and what not).


And yes, I don't prefer this method either.  Granted, a few extra points can be negligble, especially to skilled players, still having a lot of apparently base-line-needed gems for certain weapons being so far away and hard to get is stupid imo (again, thinking those %+flat arcane gems for BoM/burial blade). 




 Right.  I've read up on a lot of the posts about ranges, and it being similar to invading further upwards beyond the original DaS equation (akin to DaS2), but even then, I know there are a lot of stubborn people sticking to 50-80, but I suppose that is why a lot of us make multiple characters at multiple ranges :D


But I also have the urge to make a new character anyhow, because I enjoy creating them, and I have this really bad-ass Lemmy Kilmister character model saved that I want to employ as more of a main character, as I have thoroughly been enjoying the SKL build, but I think it would be fun to bring the STR up to 25 for additional weapon usage.  I know my other toon would be a good template, but I might just leave him where he is.  His face is kinda ugly :D 




 Right, but all the work to get that far and farm that much at chances to even get an abysmal gem, let alone one with perfect stats, for just one weapon?  Well, that is why people flock to using Ludwig's sword, because it is OP real quick with minimal investment in the game or farming, and it's bad-ass even with the base game gems.  


I'm super annoyed and dissapointed in how FROM made competitive weapon optimizing so lop-sided, and it's a total bummer that they made it so hard to maximize a lot of weapon's potential (ie, the uncanny burial blade, as the waning slot ruins the base-line model).  


I mean, I have multiple characters, and I've farmed a lot of chalices, and I have yet to see an abyssmal gem period 


Edit:  And that's not to say it shouldn't take farming/work/effort/frustration/redundancy to optimize our theoretical top-shelf OP Tonitrus that we've been discussing, but it's a lot of work to make simple/earlier game weapons shine, like the BoM and later the Burial Blade, and use it to its max :/ 




 An be a dex fag?  No whay! 




 I have a few PvP builds, and the most current/closest one I am using is similar to yours, though I had planned it to be primarily dex, but I wanted to make a quality build anyhow, so now I just feel like I could have the best of both worlds on one toon.  Anyway, Nathan Explosion is level 98, and his stats are:

45 Vit (I think, might be 44 or 46)

22 End

12 STR

50 SKL

8 BT (whatever starter stat was)

15 Arc


I mean, I could easily adjust it to make it closer to a quality build, but I think anything over 100-110 is too high, as it cuts out a lot of meta-ranges in PvP, and is frankly just unnecessary, as I enjoy focused builds where you have to sacrafice some power/expertise over others. 




 RACISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSM!  You're so racist!  Stop justifying brutal america's crooked cops purposefully oppressing the socio-economically disenfranchised urban youths!


Just kdiding.  In all seriousness, so sick of the politically-correct bull-shit and people who choose to sympathize with stupid and ignorant people.  But hey, who needs to change when you have the perfect, perpetual victim card?  Change aint a one-way street. 




 Here's another reply for you:  Bolt (and fire) scaling works off arcane, right?  Have you tried optimizing the Tonitrus on your quality build?  How do the stats and the damage look with nore STR than arcane?  If you have tested it out for max damage on that build, what's gems have you used so far, and what does the final damage output look like? 




 And now I want to build a new character based on your quality build, as it sounds like it optimizes a lot of weapons and can make for a very diverse character... but man oh man, running all those chalices again...  :( 




 My Skill build is at 98, and close to this, with a few less end, a few more vit points, and only 12 STR.  It is tempting to move him towards this quality direction and open up so many more options on who and what is my favorite character, but I really don't want to level him up any more :( 




 Yeah.  I don't think I've seen gems like that, though I could check on my main to see if he has anything remotely close, though he is mostly retired.


Anyway, I ask because I wanted to make a quality build for PvP to have access to a variety of weapons (as variety is what has always made the souls games fun as fuck), yet remain competitive - so I wanted to use ludwig's (which I never really liked that much), the cleavers, and hearing that tonitrus can be pretty bad-ass on a quality build makes me happy as well :D


But first, I need to go find me an uncanny burial blade, and then I need %/flat arcane gems with less shitty negatives, and then, another blood rock... ugh.  Sometimes I really hate how they did rocks and weapon variants in this game  




 What does the damage look like on tonitrus with the %phys/flat arcane gems?  Seems like it could really shine on a STR build.


I've been farming those flat arc gems, but so far no luck, because I keep getting the shitty -HP gems, though the few -kin/beast damage are great for PvP.


Do you use the regular burial blade with its shitty waning slot, or do you use an uncanny burial blade?  Or  As it seems it would be able to possibly pump out the most damage (2 radial and a triangle gem slot) since triangle gems come as +9% physical with the +70 flat arcane damage, whereas, it's hard to find a decent waning gem for the burial blade, or at least, so far it has been, and I have that 18% physical gem found in the main game on it.
