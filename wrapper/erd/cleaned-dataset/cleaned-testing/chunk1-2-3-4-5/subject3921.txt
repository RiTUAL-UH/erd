 I have study hall and I have nothing to play. 




 How'd you, Rob, and Charlie meet? How close are you guys? 




 I mean I think they would play really similar. It's not like they would have to change the whole way he played. But after they sorted out all the copyright issues then I think it would work. I don't expect it to happen I just think it would be cool and really fun. 




 I think this would be so cool being a huge god of war fan. I think it wouldn't be too difficult since they both have the same kind of weapons, just change the look. I don't know what others would think.  Just an idea.  




 Alright man I'll take into consideration what you said and I'll definitely apply it next time I play. Thanks a lot dude 




 This is awesome. Thanks dude and what do you think is the better matchup for Marth and Squirtle? R.O.B. or Sonic? 




 I main R.O.B. and Sonic and I need to figure out how to beat my friends mains. (Squirtle/Marth) 




 Self confidence man, self confidence  




 Haha what was her reaction? 




 Just curious to hear these. 




 My parents are divorced and are still friends, my mom recently started dating a black man (my family is all whites), my dad was over looking for a key to a car. Keep in mind my dad has NEVER made a vulgar joke around me. While talking about the key to the car she says,
"Yeah, it's big and black."

and so my dad says,

"Yeah, that's two things that are big and black." You can clearly see how butthurt my mom is.

Five minutes later he comes up to me and says "Daddy's clever, right?" and high fived me. I've never laughed so hard.  




 Dad: "Oh did you hear about that celebrity that stabbed her husband? It was Reese something..."

Me: "Witherspoon?"

Dad: "No, with her knife." 





























 I also have the newest one. Into the nexus. Is that okay if I do that? 




 Alright then, and I have the R C collection for ps3 that features Ratchet and Clank, Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando, and Ratchet and Clank: Up your arsenal. I no longer own a ps3. 




 Yes very much so!! I'm so sorry I didn't reply! Message me! 




 Thank you!!!! Someone not judgmental. Appreciate it. :) 




 Which ones do you have? Also have the newest one. Into the Nexus. I'd have to take another look but I'll keep you updated my man! 




 Like what? 




 I sold my ps3 but miss Ratchet and Clank too much. Thank you. 




 I watched first season and a little of second and not a lot caught my attention. Does it get a lot better? 




 I'm a new Chronos and I don't think that the build I'm using now is too good. Any long time Chronos players got a good build? 




 I fool you not sir, this was one of the smallest amazing thing I've ever seen. 









 I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post on. If it isn't give me the right one please but anyway. In January my family and I had discovered my sister had developed a nasty addiction to heroin and prescription pills. We sent her to rehab and she had gone for 4 months and she had just gotten out last week. The day she got out she relapsed, she started using cocaine. She had confessed to my parents and I. We had no clue what to do, so we started taking part in IOP (intensive out patient). She goes 3 times a week and gets tested, she has been passing but even so my parents have been super anxious, my parents are divorced. My dad does not show too much emotion but he does eat a lot of sugar and he has diabetes which is clearly not good for his health. My mom who I live with predominately has been pushing a lot of home renovations on herself and I. She said to me today "I rearrange furniture in my own house cause it is the only thing that I can control." I can't get it out of my head, it is just something that I thought was so deep. She does everything around the house and pushes way too much work on herself. My sister is in Vineland and then off to Woodbury if anyone knows where that is. I'm so anxious and so are my parents. Anything we can do you guys think we can do to calm our nerves? Thank you. 




 Damn I want that now 




 This is what's up. The name is awesome too.  




 I love Apollo he is hands down favorite character in game. There's just one thing he lacks. Skins. Anyone got some cool Apollo skin ideas? 
























 How about depending how much shipping is I'll pay it. I live in the New England area.  




 Another game I have you may be interested in is Transformers: the first Cybertron one. The case is a little messed up but the game itself works perfectly.  




 Nothing that may interest you. Cut really short on ps3 games ever since I sold it. Would you mind just coming to an agreement for just the collection? I apologize. 




 Do you like quality of game? And can I see your pictures? Plus another game I have NBA 2K13 if that means anything.  




 http://imgur.com/a/ijSxW here is the collection. I think into the nexus is currently in my friends possession if it cannot be found I'll list some other games that may peak your interest.  




 Yeah I have a character for each position that I'm decent at but I'm just really good at those guys. Thank you. 




 Hey guys, I'm about to start ranked play and was just wondering who gets banned. I play Odin which concerns me a little, but also play a lot of Apollo and Mercury. Thanks guys. 




 Classy response.  




 Okay thank you, man. For being understanding. I'll do it as soon as I can! 




 May I do it tomorrow? I'm off my computer and unfortunately cannot send the pictures from my phone. Does that sound okay? 




 I'm going to take the pictures of into the nexus right now.  




 It won't let me post it on gameswap. It says it only allows text posts. Is there another way I can successfully send you the picture?  




 I can't send the pictures through the comment but I will post them on gameswap and just go to my account to see them. Sorry for the inconvenience.

 




 Both really really nice. Will send pictures right now. Let me get them and send the pictures. May I ask you do the same? 




 Yes sir. 4 games total. 





























 They DID mention a new one coming down the line soon enough. It may not make you feel awesome but who cares? For me I'm repping my favorite smite team and youngbae is my favorite Apollo player he got me to play Apollo again after I stopped. So I'm damn well buying the skin and you don't have to I just thing that it's just a nice little change up. You don't HAVE to like it. You also don't HAVE to get the skin. 




 Maybe it doesn't fit your appeal. As a legendary Apollo I think it looks nice and may wait for gem drop BUT with the free gems you can win this weekend you may only have to pay for 400. I think it looks nice. 




 Confirmed! 




 Successful trade with MuseTheGreat. Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando, Ratchet and Clank: Up your Arsenal, and Ratchet: Deadlocked. Great guy! 




 League of Legends has it, Dota 2 has it, what about Smite? I know some may think that it could be a disadvantage; but I disagree. I mean, if you and another friend of yours want to join a ranked game and duo or just play together so you don't feel totally alone. Also, everybody else can do it as well. So pretty much everyone can get an advantage if they chose to play with someone. For me, it is more of just a comfort thing of knowing your friend is in the same game with you. Plus, you may work well with your friend if you two were to duo. It just discourages me because about 5 of my close friends all play smite and we constantly do premades, sieges, arenas, and assaults. Occasionally if someone isn't on we will play conquest. What do you guys think?  




 I was ranging from about 1990-now. 




 Really cannot agree more.  









 Did it 




 They all look really really good, and sadly, no. I will continue looking but the offer for the paid shipping is still up if its inconvenient for you. 




 Actually closer to Philadelphia. I guess I'm not too familiar with the map and regions haha.  




 Just someone with a funny design like Ymir, Kumba, Ne Zha, Bakasura, etc. 




 That's fine. I was aiming about ten or below. We'll discuss the shipping and stuff tomorrow but may I see the pictures? 





























 You, I like you. 




 Me and a few friends got into a conversation about weird middle names. We wanted to see a few! 




 No, I'm an Anus Explorer. It's not very official, it's kind of a getting paid under the table type job, you know? 




 Your username is shockingly relevant to my profession.  




 Requiem for a Dream. 




 Fuck, this was so beautiful. I love their relationship and the worst things always happened To Jesse. Thanks for showing me this...bitch. 









 These guys are awesome! Definitely the new favorite. Thanks so much dude its such a hassle finding a new band.  




 This is helpful, thanks very much. You kind of said everything I couldn't express myself. 




 I'm 15, and I really want to work at a produce stand/farm. My dad used to be a farmer and has connections to try to get me a job. If anyone has any experience working at a farm at a young age can you tell me what it is like? Is it worth it? 









 Your lack of legitimacy in your answer in attempts to be funny is very pathetic.  




 Chronos is the man but I will agree a fed enemy chronos makes you wanna punch a wall. 




 Wow, really surprised no one said Loki! I despise him and would pick him in a heartbeat, but I feel you guys.
