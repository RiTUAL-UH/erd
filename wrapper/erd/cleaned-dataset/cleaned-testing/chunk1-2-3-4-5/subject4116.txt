 As a kid, did you ever used to close your hands over the end of a flashlight, and marvel at the way they glowed red in the dark? Maybe it was just me.

Yesterday at work, the power went out. We work in an older building, and it happens occasionally. For some reason, Gary, the guy who sits in the cubicle across the hall has two high-powered LED flashlights. I think they were the kind made for hunting. Anyway, the things are blinding.

Meanwhile, my computer is down, work has stopped, we're just waiting for them to find the fuse and reboot our tedious workday. I guess I got nostalgic, because after a while, I was putting my hands over the end of the flashlight like I did when I was a kid. Gary's flashlight was brighter than the ones I'd used before, and you could see the outlines of the bones.

There was something unusual about my left ring finger, though. The skin there glowed differently. Tiny lines stretched from my second knuckle to the third, nearest my palm. It looked like I had a tattoo.

A bar code. 




 The first creature that I saw in this place... I never saw at all. It was before I'd found a light. The only way that I knew that it was there was by the sound of its breathing, stirring the emptiness.

I was naive. Inexperience in this endless cavern told me that the rules still applied. That an empty room in the dark was still empty.

"Hello?" I called, and my voice echoed back. Still, there was something there. I could hear the faint ticking raspiness of air moving through its open mouth.

At this time, I was still standing. Foolishly, I stretched my hand toward where I'd heard the noise. My feet carried me half-heartedly. Left foot forward, then the right one coming up to join it.

It must have been close. I could hear its breath with perfect clarity now, deep and huge. I could feel the cool air against my sides, pulling me toward it; smell the scent of decay on its warm breath. Each time it inhaled, there was a whirring, ticking sound like tiny ratcheting gears being wound.

It was my nose that betrayed me. The dead-smelling exhaust tickled my nostrils and brought tears to my eyes. I sneezed, and loudly. Before the echo even made its way back to my ear, a huge metallic clang tore the silence from the air. It felt at the time as though my sneeze had broken the world.

Behemoth footballs, ringing one after the other, washed around the endless space. My ears split and popped from the noise. My hands, uncommanded, clawed into my ears, trying to pull the painful noise from them, but only managed to dull the edge a little.

Then it was gone. Wet drops poured from my ears as I lay in a pile on the smooth, cool stone. 




 My name is Jack Sweeney, and Im from the same place as you are. Set aside a few superficial differences, and I could have been you. This is important, because when I lived in your time, I did nothing to stop the events that are now happening in mine. Because I didn't know. No one did.

I could have been you, and if Id known the things that Im about to tell you, then I could have stopped it.

It started with LImBo in the U.S.; Land-based Impassable Borders. They finally had a low-cost, sustainable and highly efficient solution to controlling their border problem. With a few field emitters, the entire southern border was almost instantly walled off from Mexico and South America. A blue, impassable screen stretched two thousand feet above the surface, and as deep as they could drill below.

I've touched them. They feel cool and smooth like glass, and you can see distorted shapes of things from the other side inside it, swirling with the field.

The fields required no further energy beyond the simple setup. Three emitters to make a triangle of any size, four to make a square. Once theyd been set, it was supposed to take over a hundred years for the molecules to decay and turn back into air. This meant that the transmitters could be removed and reused infinitely.

It was the threat of war that persuaded the smaller European countries to put up their own walls. Skilled technicians were in high demand, erecting fences across the many borders. Borders were disputed, complex agreements were signed, but once the walls went up... there was nothing much more final than that. Pictures from the orbit at night showed Europe glowing blue.

A few of the smallest countries seemed to disappear completely. The only way in or out from these places was by air. The average person would never see the inside. 

There was no war. Not in the sense that theyd been expecting, anyway. The first time a border fell was between the small town of Trevechia and its larger counterpart, Yuhgo. Trevechia held about 3,000 people. Its largest attraction was an ancient church that stood in the middle of town. The border changed from cool, dark blue to fiery red. From the people of Yuhgos perspective, the little town was burned away like some kind of deathly MRI scan. It plowed a smoking trough through the middle of the country, Gerzek, toward its capital city of the same name.

In a last-ditch effort to stop the wall, a set of field-emitters and a special team were flown into Gerzek. It was, perhaps, the best team anywhere in the world. My team. Wed been prepped to respond to the escalating tensions in the region, ready to stop anything that started. Even we werent sure that it would stop this, however, and we made sure that the helicopter pilots kept the rotors spinning in case things didnt work out.

At midnight, and not a minute too soon, we initiated the field. It was thick. The thickest any of us had ever seen.

You could feel the red wall vaporizing the ground as it pressed toward us. My team was hovering above the ground with as many passengers as we could take when it found our blue border. Like molten glass, it bent, curving to match the angle, but its momentum never slowed. At the moment when it could go no further, the air crackled like it was full of electricity. Our helicopter dropped. The only lights left were the moon and the stars. When I crawled clear of the wreckage, the walls were gone.

The secret to turning the borders into weapons of mass destruction was out in a matter of days. Teams like mine, composed of only a few people could systematically destroy entire countries. Europe and Asia bore many scars.

Ten times as many LImBos went up. They were the weapon, but also the defense. Threats were made, and bombs were dropped from the sky. AImBos were engineered, and aerial warfare and travel almost totally ceased. The first time an Aerial Impassable Border was turned into a weapon, it turned Hawaii into nothing but a cloud of steam.

Then, after enough walls went up, the world fell into an uneasy peace. People went about rebuilding their lives from inside their transparent cubes.

It wasnt the U.S. that broke the peace. Not that we werent trying to think of a way. Someone small, independent and well-connected enough to get inside, found it first. Huge triangle-shaped swaths of Earth simply sank into the ground in four different countries. The walls theyd built to protect them against the outside world sealed them in instead. They were slowly consumed by the red Hell beneath their feet.

Its going to be an awful way to die. As I write this, the East Coast of the United States is sinking. Its genius, really. In a few more minutes, the ocean will drain into the void that is left. Its too late for walls.

I have to believe that if wed known, we never would have built that first Border. *I* never would have built that first Border.

You know, now. Please, stop me. 




 Staff Sergeant Donovan Berr woke up, face down in the middle of the road. Sergeant Berr had seen better days. In the past week, he'd survived a plane crash, a chemical weapons attack, fended off a family of mutant boar, and had quite possibly survived to see the end of the world.

What a week.

As Donovan lifted his head, a mix of drool, blood and quite a bit of something else entirely stuck to the side in a thick string. Heat rose from the asphalt below him and beamed down from above. Everything hurt. Donny's neck gave up and laid his head back on the blacktop, and he pinched his one usable eye tight against the sun.

The last thing he'd remembered was the smiling faces of his three companions. Other survivors of the plane crash. There had been fire, and drinks. Man, had they been drunk. Must have been. "Open bar!" one of his friends had called out to them from the unpowered glass-doored beer cooler. And it had been.

Poor Donovan heaved up a wet, chunky mixture of last night's all-you-can-eat steak and pizza.

*Wait, fire? A fire inside?*

He tried to recall the image, but the lack of a clear airway brought his thoughts back to the present. With an awesome effort, Donny managed to turn his head and exhale enough bile through his nose and throat so that he could take another breath.

*Fire. Drinks. A party? A party for what?*

"A party for what?" he'd screamed into dead, senseless eyes. "Everyone everywhere is dead, we left those two back at the fucking hangar. They're going to die! We have to get help! Don't you understand that?"

He'd shaken the person wearing a camouflage uniform until his sizeable arms had gotten tired. He wanted to hit them, to scream louder, somehow from *inside* their lolling heads, so that they'd *have* to listen. They were gone, though. Lights on, nobody's home.

A person younger than him, maybe an Airman, started pouring lighter fluid onto a childrens' clothing display. Automatic rifle slung across his back like some kind of action movie hero, he flipped the bright orange stub of his lit cigar onto the soaked, folded shirts. Pity, he didn't stand back far enough, and the lighter fluid quickly found him. 

Two of the three remaining in the dark, but not so dark anymore, Target superstore began laughing and pointing maniacally.

Donny watched in horror as the kid went up in flames.

Donny - the hot Donny, the one being fried like a griddlecake out on the street - well his stomach threatened to heave again. Since his head had turned, his non-sealed eye was in the shade of his broken nose, and he could get a little look around without bringing too much pain onto himself.

Palm trees and trimmed green grass. Hawaii. Probably fell out of the back of the truck somewhere near a golf course. God damn it, it was hot, though. Where was the fog they'd had when they'd landed? *Tried* to land, anyway.

The fog. That weird fog that hung over the whole island. Hadn't it been more than a little bit purple? Glowing, even? Not for the first time, Don wondered if maybe that had something to do with why everyone had disappeared. Not that there would be an explanation. Four guys (well, six if you counted the two they'd left at the hangar after the crash, though they might as well have been in the Alps from where poor Don was laying) weren't about to solve any kind of worldwide mystery on their own. Don couldn't even lift his own hand.

Maybe that fog could explain why the others had gone... *off* too.

Don heard a scuffle nearby, and felt a small breeze blow across his hot face.

A crazy thought occurred to him; maybe he should have gotten drunk with the guys last night. He couldn't have known that it was about to be his last day alive, but surely with everyone else gone, there was no future. Ol' Donny was just a little slower on the uptake than the others. Maybe they were the ones who'd had it right. 

*That kid with the kerosene, yeah, he had the right idea. "Go out in flames" was the saying, after all.*

Something smacked the side of D's face, sending a few red droplets down into his narrow field of vision. It felt like a hand made out of fire that grabbed something underneath the layers of missing skin and rearranged bone, and then pulled. Some... *part*, something never intended to be on the outside, gave out with a pop, and his brain registered light from his eye on that side for a split second.

More scuffles, and a flutter of large black wings.

More and more, he regretted not taking that drink. Stealing some steak and pizza and huddling into a corner of a Target Superstore, listening to his crazed coworkers singing and screaming their own made up language was hardly the way that a man should have to spend his final night.

His eye closed, then saw just out in front of him was sitting an ice cold can of beer he hadn't noticed before. He reached a hand out and took it, feeling the coolness of it in his palm. Tasting the hoppy, foamy bitterness on his lips. Now that was a way that a man should die. 




 Constructive Criticism, Please!

 Let's talk about expectations for a minute. Stereotypes. Associations.

What comes to mind when you hear the word "teacher?" What do you picture? If that's too broad, think of a "high school English teacher, male, in his late 20's." What's he wearing? What did he drive to work? What expression is on his face? 

Now, these exercises are, by nature, reductive - a person is not solely defined by his job title, age, appearance, gender, race. One man can can even have many sides, depending on who he knows is watching. They're reductive, but that doesn't mean that they don't serve a purpose. In college, there was an assignment to list 100 things about someone based on only a few details. This was so that when you wrote a character, called ["The Janitor,"](http://redd.it/2deuf4) without saying anything else about him, you would know how your audience was going to picture them.

Think back to that teacher that you pictured earlier. I'll feed you some details this time. 

This is Charlie. He's wearing the same pale blue button-up for the third day in a row, hoping no one will notice. It's the same shirt he wore to his internships, only with one fewer button, allowing his newly filled out gut to push through. He came to work in the same Volkswagen P.O.S. that he drove away from this high school after he graduated. On his face as he grades an endless pile of shitty book reports isn't an expression. The particular fuse in his brain that controlled facial expression burnt out sometime around 2 am. Now there's just red, and clear beads of fever sweat from a month of living on fast food and the Smirnoff he kept hidden in his desk.

As he scribbles "F" on one more paper, the pen fails to stream any more ink. After what's felt like eons of tireless, thankless work, the pen has given up. As it's stabbed into the desk, it collapses under the force and shatters. Clear plastic splinters lodge themselves into the flesh of his hand, the teacher's own red fluid stains the desk like sponge paints, again and again.

The only thing that stops him from tearing apart the desk, the students desks, the windows, the cheesy posters and chalkboard on the the walls, and then going to work on himself is the feeling of eyes pressing on him from the rear of the lecture hall, just out of reach of his small desk lamp. Is it the feeling of eyes, or the barely audible sound of someone breathing heavily?

In the stillness, he can hear it more clearly. It's not a whisper as scratchy as sandpaper and a snake's hiss, it's laughter, coming from a dark shape in the darkness. Staring, straining to see in the dark, he hears the breath catch and go silent.

"Hey! Who's up there?"

*Pop!*

Charlie's alcohol-depressed nervous system reacts without him, flinching away from the tight, hollow sound.

"Come out of there. You're scaring me."

"Charles?"

Something about the word, fetched from the darkness isn't right. It's too dry-sounding, like the throat that produced it was full of dust-bunnies. It's too round, like the mouth that formed it was too lazy, or lethargic from years of misuse. It's too formal, like it forgot where, or when it was.

These details rattled through Charlie's brain for a moment before being swept away by the sight of something emerging from the darkness.

Two points of light, reflections of the lamp in each lens of a pair of over-sized glasses. A man, hunched and pitted, like he's been dried in the sun. His face is covered in wrinkles like cracks, little spidery voids that expose the black void within. A set of coveralls so ancient, it looks like they're made of purely dirt and dust, swept from some unknown basement.

The further the man comes into the light, the more corpse-like he appears. Eyes are gray and flat, like newspapers.

"Charles Grant?"

Charlie remembers himself and tries to run, but stumbles over his heels, and ends up sitting hard on the desk.

For some reason, despite the toll that years of death has taken, Charlie can just recognize the janitor from when he did his time as a student. After all, it had been the janitor who had cut the lock from the locker on Monday, when he'd been stuffed there on Friday. The janitor who had pulled him down from the flag pole, and cut the duct tape from around his mouth and wrists. It was the janitor who had found Charlie unconscious in the girl's bathroom, covered in blood where a group of kids had broken his jaw and left him.

It doesn't take long before the janitor has found his voice again, and begins telling the new teacher the things he's seen. 

Terrible things. Horrible tales about the seemingly normal and happy families and people who passed through the halls of the school every day. Things that he couldn't have known - that no one could have known.

I am Charlie. Excuse me, "Mr. Grant."

This is how I met the janitor. How he came to me, in order that I might finish what he could only dream of starting.

It took some time to build the contraption. It was time well-spent, however. It's important to always use the proper tool for the job.

Sure, there were a lot more efficient options for killing... but somehow this one seemed more fitting.

Cleaner.

The setup was simple. A small compressed gas chamber, put pressure on top of a two gallon reservoir of 10% bleach in water. The pressure pushes the solution through a hose to a trigger-operated shutoff valve. And the whole thing is tipped with a 6-inch-long, lethally sharp, quarter inch gauge stainless steel needle. In less than one second, the bleach solution could be blasted into the needle at pressures above two hundred pounds per square inch.

It took some planning to get Mary S. alone. It had to be predictable and I obviously couldn't allow myself to be observed or interrupted. I followed her for a day to feel out her routine and to find an appropriate location. While I was waiting, I found my next victim.

I was parked in front of Mary's workplace in a gravel lot. Having a police cruiser pull up behind my car gave me a scare, and I thought of the difficult- (but not impossible) to-explain bleach blaster in my trunk. When I caught a glimpse of the officer's face in the mirror, it was almost a relief. 

Of course I know who he is. I know all about Officer Morgan. I know all about *everyone* here, now. It's almost encyclopedic. And the truth is, real monsters are all around us, hiding in plain sight. I could see his sins as plainly as the stains breakfast had left on his uniform.

* Accepts bribes in exchange for tips on places with low security or where the owners will be away.
* Runs protection against the law for drug traffickers doing business in town.
* Has been directly involved in the cover-up of five separate missing persons.
* Responsible for the murder and disposal of a hooker.

No, excuse me. A "lady of the night."

I'd known McKenzie, since she'd been a student at the high school. She was a good kid, but she got dealt a bad hand at home. It was her dad who forced her into the game, and her mom and all her uncles took the money to get high. Sometimes, when a kid goes through that much slime, it doesn't wipe off. Especially when the people they crawl to for help throw them right back into the shit bucket with a little bit of cash.

He had it coming now.

I watched him as he walked up the side of my car, peered through his mirrored aviators at me, and without a word, wrote me a ticket for being illegally parked. I was outraged, and got out of the car to protest. The worm didn't even acknowledge my existence. He waddled over to a red-painted wooden beam that was intended to mark part of the fire lane, dragged it through the gravel into position behind my car, and dropped it there with a hollow "thunk." What a dick.

Excuse me, what a *fucking* dick.

Later, I followed Mary to the school, where she went to pick up Kayla. Pulling into the familiar parking lot, I noticed that the generator area where I'd found the door was roped off with yellow caution tape. Suddenly, I couldn't remember whether I'd locked the door that night; I couldn't remember anything except the rush of finding the truth. Since that moment, I'd been so caught up in this that I forgot all about work. I hadn't cleaned all weekend. 

I found my reserved parking slot, but saw that there was a familiar, gray van parked there instead.

The Happy Janitor

I'd been replaced.

I guess it's official. I'm that kind of janitor anymore.

The next morning, I snuck into the back seat of her car before she left for work. Everything was in position and perfect - I practiced how I would strike, and the needle slid through the seatback like a hot knife through butter. I imagined what it would be like, her sitting down, oblivious in the pre-dawn haze of morning. She'd start up the car, back out of the driveway using only her mirrors, take a left at the end of the street, and then pull off onto the shoulder to light up a cigarette, a habit she kept from her husband and her kids.

It wasn't the only filthy thing she'd done since the sun had gone down.

Everything went perfectly. Right down to the way she'd retrieved her cigarettes and lighter before rolling down the window, so that her screams would be muffled inside the sealed car.

I pushed the needle up to the hilt and pulled the trigger, bracing myself for the kickback, the probable explosion of viscera and bodily fluids and bleach that would be forthcoming.

Instead, there was nothing.

Mary rolled down the window and lit her cigarette.

I frantically checked my rig. Everything was perfect. It wasn't possible that the needle hadn't pierced into her heart or lungs and powerfully disinfected her from the inside of her chest cavity out.

I stabbed again. Shot again. Nothing.

When that had failed, I tried to use the hose to strangle her... But she sat there, unaware and unaffected by my straining efforts to depart her from this world.

I couldn't kill her.

I can't kill *anyone.*

But I know just who deserves it. 

I see the truth of the *uncleanness* of the world around me with perfect clarity... Yet I am totally unable to do anything about it.

Is this Hell?

My first is Mary S.

Mary S. hurts her kids. She loves her son, Robbie, but she hates her daughter Kayla with some unimpeded passion. In fact, most people dislike Kayla. 

Excuse me, "hate" Kayla.

They do it in varying degrees and show it with different types and elevations of violence against her. Each of which leave their own brand of scar.

And the honest truth is, even I didn't like her... Before. I mean, she is kind of... strange. She just doesn't fit in. She's not like the others, and the differences aren't borne gracefully.

Now, there isn't anyone who doesn't have at least a few flaws. No one is qualified to *cast the first stone*, so to say. But that isn't the system that I operate by. The way I like to work is by tackling the big messes first, and wiping them away. Justice.

Pardon me. "Retribution."

And what makes *me* qualified to be the judge of whether a person is worthy of their sentence before their natural death? The truth, of course.

The truth was revealed to me as I passed through the door last night. The truth is what was in that basement. At first, I had thought to fight it. To kill it. But as I crossed the threshold, in the place where I had expected the personification of evil, I found beauty itself in all its magnificence.

I saw.

The truth is light - and it should not be feared for the things that it is cast upon. And she has cast a *great deal* of light on the people of this town.

Which brings me to my revelation about little Kayla. I can say with a conviction deeper than knowing that she is clean. She is as undeserving of her mother's hatred as her brother is of her love. A love gone too far. 

The truth that everyone else misses as they shy away, made uncomfortable by the sight of a mother who hits her daughter, is that that the same mother turns around and lusts for her own young son.

And so Mary S. became my first.

But not my last - far from my last. I suspect that this town will be a much smaller place when I have finished my work. A great many people have brought this filth here. They've managed to hide it, a festering sore, full of infection that could spread to the rest of us, spreading the filth and shit, unchecked.

And if there's one thing I hate, it's a mess.

I'm a janitor, after all.

[Not That Kind of Janitor](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2d4zgq/im_not_that_kind_of_janitor_anymore/) 




 It's not the easiest job being a janitor.

Excuse me, I'm supposed to call myself a "Custodial Engineer" now.

You might think that it's just brainless, rote work, but you end up finding yourself thinking a lot about whether you really want to do the things you're about to do.

*Why am I scraping this gum off the floor? It's just going to be there again tomorrow.*

*I just had to put that bag of garbage down because the smell was too much. Do I want to pick that up again?*

*Do I really want to scoop ten pounds of human waste out of this toilet right now?*

Getting into these kinds of dirty situations isn't natural, in the biological sense. Some strong, primal segment of your mind is telling you not to go there. Not to subject yourself to that. That it's not safe.

I found the entrance to the basement two days ago. Not *the* basement, there are separate basements under each section of the school; the gym has a storm shelter under it; the band room stores their old and broken instruments in theirs; under the lunch room, there are props and costumes for things like football games, homecoming and prom. The basement I found is under the auto shop.

It was midnight, and despite clear, starry skies, the power went out while I was mopping down the History and English hallway. To turn on the lights, I had to turn on the auxiliary power generator, located in an enclosure off of the auto shop.

Excuse me, it's a "Vocational Training Lab" now.

Anyway, I go past the auto shop, into the enclosure, turn on my flashlight and... there's a door. And for some reason I've never seen it before, or I saw it and didn't realize that it was a door. From the outside, it's just a little square with a hinge. It could be a vent, or an access panel for wiring, but this night, for whatever reason, I realize that it's a door and that the bottom half is buried in the gravel that rings the cement pad that the generator sits on. I dig a little and find a handle.

As soon as I touched the handle, I could hear voices from the other side. At first I thought there were two people arguing, but now I'm sure that it's just one. And Jesus, the things that it's said... 

About me, about the other students and teachers. About my friends and family. Things that *no one* knows. He told me which of my neighbors beat their kids. Which of my friends cheat on their spouses. He told me about the time the old Economics teacher, Mr. Parker was in high school and accidentally hit someone with his car and got away with it. About what Principal Taylor and his frat buddies did to someone's little girl...

It's been down there a long time, watching, listening. I sat and listened all night.

I haven't slept.

I can't close my eyes because if that thing with the whispering voice like a mix of sandpaper and an angry snake's hiss were there at the foot of my bed when I opened them... I'd just rather die than live that moment.

I dug away the gravel. Today, I'm going to open the door.

I got a sharp piece of metal from the auto shop, and wrapped the bottom of it like a spear. Do you think that'll work?

As a janitor, you find yourself asking yourself a lot of times if you really want to do the thing you're about to do, and I definitely don't want to go through that door, but I have to.

Because there's something in there. Something unclean.

We stayed in Ahmed's "model house" for 14 days. 

Ahmed was right; other than the plane, an attempt to escape would have gotten me killed. There's just nothing out there. Apparently the mock town they'd built to test weapons was one of a few that was never actually used, and that's the reason that it's safe to be there for any period of time. I asked Ahmed what his role in all of this was, and he couldn't give me many details. He was... quirky.

He worked for the U.S. National Parks Service. For about ten years they've had him conducting sweeps of the abandoned houses and buildings out there. It was a logical step to adopt one as a "home camp," since trips out there weren't exactly easy. I went with him on some of the sweeps, it was pretty uneventful. Most of the buildings were in bad shape. The sand had shifted and been swept by the wind up around most of them, and the hastily-constructed structures couldn't often take the weight. I never quite got used to seeing the families of mannequins huddled around the T.V. or laying on bare mattresses.

Most of the time, the only danger Ahmed found was from wild animals who had made their dens in the abandoned buildings. He had found squatters before of course. People who had driven off into the desert for who-knows-what reason. They were the reason he'd started carrying a gun. Then he met a man in a bar.

"The man wore a suit - full suit to this bar and he asks me what I do. I tell him I give tours of the parks for most of the year and sometimes I travel to the remote federally-owned lands to look for problems. This man is very interested in this, and talks to me for a long time about how technology takes our independence. I talk to him again a few times through e-mail and he asks me if I can take someone with me on one of these trips. It's not usual, but I tell him that I could do it and no one would know.

"The first person he sends, I meet them at a hotel in California. He thinks I don't know that he's watching and asking questions to see what I know. I bring him here - this is before I purchased my plane - and he tries to sabotage us. He pours out the water, sabotages the food, cuts apart his shoes. But I know how to find water. I can hunt here, I can make shoes. So after two weeks, we go back to California. Then I hear from him again. This one I meet, North in Idaho. They are blindfolded and handcuffed. They give him to me and tell me he cannot use the phone, and that he is very dangerous.

"This one I watch very closely. The first night, while he sleeps, I hide the keys and remove the battery from my van so he cannot take it. When I get back, I see him leaving, trying to head North. This way, I know, there is nothing. I pack my bag and I follow him. He is smart, and hides from the sun in the day and moves at night. So I follow him further and let him think that he is alone. The next night, he starts to go a different way. From this, I know that he does know where he's going. There is a small town that way, but it is still too far to go.

"He starts to cramp from the lack of water, and falls down. I come up behind him and he begs. Begs like a dog for water and food and for me to take him back. I don't have enough water now, and I told him not to try to run. So I shoot him, and bury him there in the desert.

"After this, every few months, I get a call for someone to bring. No more tests."

After our two weeks was up, we head back to the plane. We load up the gear and take off, but stay low. We're flying at night now. An hour away, he sets us down again on a little lighted runway where we meet a fuel truck. He really didn't take any chances.

After re-fueling, we returned to the municipal airport we'd left from in Oregon. On the ground, Ahmed seemd to be irritated about something. Someone was late, or not showing up to pick me up. He said he'd give me a ride instead, but I detected a little bit of worry sneaking into his normally reserved face.

We went to the coffee shop first, since it was closer. I was wearing fresh clothes that Ahmed had brought packed for me, but I hadn't had a shower in two weeks, and I was sure they would be able to smell me coming. If they would have been there.

All the doors were locked, and the windows were blacked out. No one was there, not even a car in the parking lot, including my own. Ahmed agreed to take me to my house so that no one would ask questions. I didn't have money or a phone or anything. He wanted answers as well, but no one was returning his calls.

I let myself in with a spare key. Everything appeared to be untouched in my house. My phone was still missing. On a hunch, I went to check my email. Amid the junk that had piled up there, there was one from Sam. It was an image of a bunch of warped text like a Captcha. It loaded instantly.

    test_subject4116,

    Hope you get this.
    They were too fast.
    They found us before we could get away with it.
    Plus, I think my New York friend turned.
    :(
    |'m sorry for everything, but at least you're safe.
    | wish I could have been here when you got back.
    Go, run away. The
    only way they won't find you is if you keep
    on the move.
    ...
    Good
    luck,
    | wish you all the best.
    Vegas is nice this time of year. I know how you used to
    Love to gamble.
    Ha. Maybe someday,
    everything will be okay and I'll see you again.
    0n the back of the monitor is your cut. I hope it helps.
    Thanks for letting us use your internet. -Sam

This is where my story ends for now. Sam if you're out there, I'm okay. Vegas was nice. So was Atlantic city. And London, Frankfurt, Tokyo and Honolulu, too.

So, when do I get to come home?

By the way, Sam, I cancelled my Dial-Up.

From the donut shop, I was carried outside. I tried to yell for help from anyone who might be outside, but I was quickly silenced as someone drove their foot hard into my stomach. I was pushed into a car, where a man with a Middle Eastern accent spoke to me from the front seat.

"I have three simple rules. You don't follow my rules, and I kill you. One, no running. You run, I shoot you in your back. Two, no communication. No phone, no internet. I don't care how you do it, I will know. And I will kill you. Three, you do exactly what I say at the moment I tell you. That's clear?"

"Yes."

I could feel myself sandwiched in between two other men in the back seat of the car. My wrists were zip-tied behind me before I got into the car, and the angle of my arms was giving me a cramp. It was hot, and getting hotter as I strained to keep the pressure off the zip-ties cutting into my wrists.

"Who are you?" I asked, but the only reply was from the rocking of the car as it sped along some unknown road.

The car came to a stop, the doors opened and the men on either side of me exited. I was being pulled out into the afternoon sun, and then I was left. I flinched, and braced myself, unsure of what was going to happen next. I heard the car accelerate and drive into the distance. The bag was taken off my head.

In front of me was the owner of the voice I'd heard. He was short and I judged that he was in his mid-fifties. He wore an old black leather jacket and gold-rimmed sunglasses. Using a black, pointed blade, he cut the zip ties from my hands.

"I am Ahmad Bari. I will be your..." he searched for the word, "*companion* in the coming weeks. Please, step on board. Be careful of your head."

At that, he motioned behind me, to a small, white airplane. We appeared to be on a runway, the town's municipal airport, I had to assume. I eyed the weapon in Ahmad's shoulder holster, before turning my back and getting on board. Once in the cockpit, Ahmad handed me a large headset and began manipulating the buttons and switches in order to prepare for takeoff.

I'd never flown in such a small plane before, and would have found the lack of equipment between me and the long drop terrifying on even my bravest of days. With the added suspense of not being told where we were going, I watched the ground fall away with a feeling of dread.

We flew for hours in silence. Only the drone of the engine hummed between us. Just as the sun was beginning to make contact with the horizon, and barren desert stretched out below us, he began to descend. I couldn't see any place to land, towns, cities, lights, roads. I couldn't see anything below us except flat desert until we were much closer. I started to be able to make out the outline of a narrow road with sand covering it. Ahmed set the plane down, and taxied for several hundred yards more. He pulled the plane under an open hangar. The rusted metal structure looked to have been long-abandoned and so caked with dirt and sand it must have been invisible from above.

He ushered me out, and had me take some gear from the rear compartment of the plane - a case of water and a large backpack. From the hangar, we headed out into the barren desert about a half mile. The sun had gone down by this time and the awkwardness of carrying the water had transformed my fingers and wrists into numb claws.

A dozen yards ahead of me, spotlighted in the bouncing beam of my flashlight, Ahmed was using a GPS signal to track something, but all that was around us was flat, barren desert.

Then, in an instant, he was gone.

I stopped walking, and began questioning my sanity. Even lying prone and without his gear, I'd have been able to see him. I turned to look in every direction around me, and then walked to where I had just seen him before he had disappeared. As I approached, out of the ground Ahmed's head and torso resurfaced.

"Come, come in."

There was light coming from through a round hole in the earth. I climbed down a ladder, and into a normal-looking, if outdated living room. Candles sat atop the flat surfaces in the room. Doorways beyond opened up into a kitchen, and a hallway with more doors. 

I was inside a house. Underneath the desert. 

Held prisoner by Ahmed Bari, who was already making himself comfortable on the green and orange patterned couch.

"Put the water in the kitchen." Ahmed pointed. "And you may have the last room on the left." 

I entered the dark kitchen, and rounded the corner. There I realized that we were not alone. Someone else had been sitting in the dark at the kitchen table, waiting. Watching.

I set down the water next to the one that Ahmed had brought, but kept my eyes on the silhouetted person on the other side of the room. Something about the way that they hadn't moved had unsettled something inside me. Some alarm was going off.

"Hello?" I ventured. My voice briefly echoed in the nearly empty kitchen. Still the figure didn't move.

"Huh?" Came Ahmed's voice from the other room.

"Who are you?" I called, trying hard to keep the nervousness out of my voice. 

If I looked away, and kept it in the corner of my eye, I could see that they were sitting with both hands flat on the table. were they wearing a suit? The candle light from the other room was much too weak to tell.

*Fine,* I reasoned to myself. *Another game. Another charade and hoop to jump through. Another reason to hate Sam for getting me into this. These people were monsters, and if they wanted to act like it, then that was fine. I turned my back to the figure and left the kitchen. In the living room, Ahmed appeared to be nearly asleep, reclined on the couch. I took my pack from the ground, and started for the hallway. 

"Don't worry about Ricky," said Ahmed unexpectedly.

"What, he doesn't talk?"

"No, he can't hear."

"Deaf?"

"No." He lifted himself off the couch. "He's a mannequin. It's fake. Like this house. It looks like a house, but it is only a model."

"A model house?"

"The military used to make them in order to test their weapons."

I nodded. I'd seen them in pictures and movies. They weren't any kind of place that I'd ever wanted to visit.

"Remember my rules. I wouldn't even have to kill you out here. You would find a way to die on your own."

I went to my room, set my bed and slept.

"Sam, look. I've seen Breaking Bad, okay? I know that this money has to be laundered or hidden or whatever. What good is it going to do except prove that I knew about this?"

"The money's legal."

"So that's why you told me to leave my house? Why we're hiding out in a closed donut shop?"

"Look, I brought you in because I think you deserve to know what's going on. That's also why I cut you in on it when the others told me not to."

"Cut the bullshit. What did you get into and how deep am I in it?"

"Remember when I said that I'd do anything to have connection speed like yours? That wasn't some hypothetical 'ask Santa' wish. I already had big plans for it. More than just the Bitcoin mining pools I told you about. Those brought in some initial capital, but the big fish lied in investment transactions."

"You're speaking in code."

"The stock market. It's called low latency, high volume trading, and it normally requires some very specific hardware." He could see the blank look on my face creeping back. "Big computers that can tell when a stock is bought or sold, and can buy or sell on its own at pre-set price points."

"So you legally got all this money from the stock market?"

"Yes. It may be frowned upon, but it's new enough that there aren't any rules against it, or against how you do it. With a fast enough connection and enough computing power, you can drop latency to under a millisecond. Nobody's ever done that before."

"So what? You're not a stock market whiz kid."

"Right. That's why I brought in... my friend. He lives in New York and he *is* a 'whiz kid.'"

"Friend," I made air-quotes with my fingers. Sam pretended not to see them.

"He knew the systems and strategies of the big big investment companies well enough to make improvements, but he was ultimately under-appreciated and ignored. I offered him a sandbox, with all the tools  he needed to invent his own system."

"So... What went wrong?"

"Nothing."

"Nothing?"

"It worked great. We've made lots of money haven't we? And it's only been a week."

"What the fuck, Sam? I thought someone was coming for me."

"Right... Well... That's..." I could tell that he didn't want to tell me what was coming. He bit his lip and leaned back in his chair. "Somebody knows about us. I mean, we're a small target a long ways away from them, but somebody's not happy about it."

"They think we stole their money," came a voice from behind the glass display case. A man in a disheveled blue button-up shirt with dirty blond hair, and a blazer that failed to close over his gut stood up and took a bite of a pink donut. "Fucking hypocritical of them, but that's what they say, anyway."

"Friends of yours?" I asked the owner of the new voice.

"Not anymore," he shrugged.

"So these are what, like hit men? Are they the mob?"

His laughter echoed around the room. I could hear the nights of booze and smoke that had settled into his lungs. I disliked him instantly for his obtuseness. "The fucking *mob.* Who is this guy? I think I like him." When the other men didn't laugh at his theatrics, he turned back to me. "Okay look, Junior. There's no mob, there's no hit man. There's no Boogey man or Santa Claus either. What we have here is an entitled asshole who just lost his investors a few million big ones."

"To us."

"To us. Which shouldn't include you if you couldn't fucking figure that out already."

"So what, he's going to steal it back?"

"No." The donut man said nonchalantly. "Nah - he just wants to kill us."

"KIll *you*, you mean?" I jabbed back. I saw Sam flinch a little as I said it, but as I saw it, he was as much at fault as this clown standing in front of me. I expected him to respond, but he only looked at Sam.

"Tell him! You're the one who wanted to bring him here."

"I'm sorry, man. It's your name on the bill for the internet connection. I still don't know how it happened, but whatever you got wasn't intended for you, and it didn't come out of nowhere either. Somebody spent big money for it. And now they want it back."

"So I'll just cancel it. I'll turn it off - they can have it. I don't give a fuck, I didn't ask for this."

"Whoah, there slugger," said the man in the blazer.

I stood and looked down at Sam. "Sam, I'm getting out of this. I'm turning it off." 

"You can't."

I felt, rather than heard two men move in front of the doors behind me. Sam looked up, his gaze piercing into me. "You can't turn off the connection until we're done."

"What do you mean 'when you're done?' No way! Sam! Stop this!"

"You're going to go away for a while. It's just easier this way. At the end of the month you can come back. You can have your cut. Honestly, it's for the best, this way."

The man in the blazer clapped and pointed at the tho men blocking the doors. "Alright then. Let's go."

A black bag dropped over my head.

I can't be angry at Sam and his friends. They had a good idea... a great idea, even. But in some Crichton-esque twist, while running through the whats and hows, they never stopped to think if they *should.*

Over our burgers, Sam explained what he and his friends were up to. I didn't quite follow, I was distracted by the weight of the fat envelope tucked into my jacket. He mentioned something about Phase I, bit coins, mining, hardware limits. It wasn't a business pitch, he was genuinely excited about this. He had a huge smile on his face the whole time, and he was talking so fast... Even if I'd paid attention, I don't think I could have said anything intelligent about it. My head was spinning.

*$4,850.*

*"My cut."*

When I went home that night, I didn't even log onto the internet. I had everything I wanted. I read a book and fell asleep.

A week went by and I got a text from Sam.

Get out of your house now!

I grabbed my backpack, with my laptop and the envelope of cash and left. As I was driving, I got another text.

Meet me at Henry's.

Henry's was a donut shop in the next town. I tried to text him back asking what was going on, but he didn't respond, and my call went straight to voicemail. The shop was closed when I got there. Thinking - *hoping* that it was some kind of joke, I tried calling him again.

The doors of Henry's opened and two men pulled me inside. A third extended an open hand. Not knowing what to do, I started to shake it.

"No. Cell phone. And keys, we're going to have to move your car."

Just then, Sam came over and shook my hand.  "Sorry, cell phones stay outside. It's a safety thing."

"Sam, what the hell's going on here?"

He sat me down at one of the few tables not covered in computers, cords and wires, but didn't say anything before pulling out another envelope. This one was thin, and inside was what felt like a credit card.

"$279,000, the last I checked," he said.

 Do you ever get nostalgic for your childhood? 

Want to go back and play the games and watch the movies that you grew up with?

So you'll understand what started me on the quest to get dial-up internet. It wasn't about the dial-up (though the sounds *are* pretty good memories) it was for a certain video game that wouldn't recognize anything but an old-school phone connection, and wouldn't let you play without it.

I had to go to my small-town electronics store to sign up. The place was sad and outdated. A Best Buy opened a few years ago, and I'm pretty sure the place hadn't had a customer since. I signed up for a phone line and the old man didn't bat an eye when I said I wanted to set up a dial-up connection.

Everything worked the day after I signed up. Of course, the multiplayer function of the game was abandoned, but I'd expected that. What I really wanted to do was upload the old mods and hacks and just play some rounds against the bots. I sure as hell wouldn't be able to convince anyone I knew to join in.

After a few hours, I got bored and logged out. In all, the setup had cost $27.78, and if I wanted to, I could play the rest of the month.

With the dial-up still on, I decided to try to browse the web, just to see how much faster it was now. I loaded Reddit - everything popped right up, including RES, pictures, thumbnails, video... Everything was working great - in fact, it was fast.

I went to Youtube. Remember pausing to buffer?

But it didn't even load. Videos played straight through on HD, with the highest resolution. The buffer bar was full as soon as the video started. Something was wrong. I was running multiple HD videos with no lag at all. With my normal connection, I had to wait a few seconds for even one page layout to load. 

I double and triple checked my connections to make sure nothing else was on. I considered for a second that if I unplugged it that it might not come back, but I had to know. Besides, there was no way that what I was seeing was real. *It's 56k, for crying out loud.*

My regular connection started up. It seemed slower than the dial-up from a few seconds ago, but no slower than normal. The moment of truth: I disconnected the network cable and plugged in the old-school phone line. The connection dialed, the robots had their argument and then it was on.

It was back. I was running Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Video in separate windows without a second's delay. It was unbelievable!

If you haven't noticed already, I don't know all that much about computers, networks, internet connections... Keeping in mind that I could still be doing something wrong, I called my friend Sam who actually does know about this kind of stuff.

He was extremely skeptical, but as he opened up some ominous-looking black windows and typed a bunch of gibberish, awe started to set in.

"How much would I have to pay you for your username and password on this connection?"

"What? Why wouldn't you just go start your own? It was really easy."

"I don't know that it would work. Look at this, though. This is your connection speed. Normal is like... a few digits. Yours barely fits on the screen."

"Really?"

"I would kill for even.... a ten-thousandth of this speed."

"How did this happen?"

"No idea. The weirdest thing is just that the hardware isn't set up to even process this much data. It should not be happening, basically. The only thing I can even think of is that since absolutely no one is on the grid with you, everything works for you. It's sort of like having thousands of connections at once."

"Am I going to, like, get in trouble for this somehow?"

"Well... No, I don't *think* so. If anyone found out, they would definitely cancel this though."

I did end up giving him the username and password. I put the hundred bucks he paid me toward an external hard drive, and started downloading. Movies, games, books, whatever. For most of the stuff, I clicked and it was there. I talked to Sam online that night, and he said that everything was working great on his side as well.

When he tried to set up his own dial-up account, everything worked normally - that is to say, very slowly. As he'd thought, something about my connection in particular was special. Then he suggested that we should try to sell the connections. I pretty much had access to whatever I wanted - I was no kind of power user, and when he started talking about making $1000 a week selling a connection that I'd paid next to nothing for, I was sold. I re-upped my contract, trying to hide the excitement in my voice as I told the worker at the electronics store what I wanted.

The rest of the week was quiet. On Sunday, I met Sam at a Burger place. He sat down and handed me an envelope, inside was close to $5000.

"What the fuck is this! You said ten people!"

"This is from ten people, including myself. It's your share." He took in the look of surprise on my face. "Honestly, I'm sorry it's not more."

---

There's more to this story, but I don't have time right now to tell it. I have to keep moving, or they'll catch up to me...

Sam, if you're out there. Believe me, I'm so sorry.

 "Cofee" was the name of a tiny mobile coffee shop. The kind that sells lattes out of a VW bus. It rolled into my town last fall, set out its misspelled sign and waited. The parking lot where the green van was set up wasn't far from my work. In fact, it was on the way. When I went there, I thought that it might have been closed because it was so dark inside. Just before I drove away, the modified side window slid open. There was a girl close to my age on the other side, smiling.

"Hi, can I get a-?" I started, but realized that they didn't have a menu anywhere.

Slowly, the girl squeezed her head and shoulders out of the window. For a split second, I thought she was going to climb straight into my car, but after her shoulders were clear and she pulled her hands through, she handed me a cardboard cup with a picture of a wagon wheel on the side and a white plastic lid. The whole time her face never changed. She withdrew from the window back into the dark and closed the window. I never even paid for it.

It was the most delicious thing I've ever tasted, or maybe will taste again. It was perfect in every way. It made me god damn *joyous*. I wanted to share the beautiful way it made me feel with the rest of the world, I mean it was just that fucking good.

So what that the girl inside had been acting weird? Maybe she'd been dared, or lost a bet. Maybe I was lucky she hadn't called me a "chicken fucker" instead.

I parked my car and started walking toward the front door of work. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a shadow moving between the other cars in the lot. I spun around, to check behind me, but no one else was anywhere around. As soon as I took another step toward work, a huge dog cut between the cars in front of me. I thought it might have been part wolf - the thing was huge and its black fur was matted and wild. It started growling and slowly walking toward me.

I backed away, but the dog advanced faster. I didn't know what else to do, so I dropped everything I'd been carrying and took off through another row of cars, hoping that it would give up the chase. It must have worked because I made it to the front doors alive. 

The next morning, I slept through my alarm and woke up with a terrible hangover. My efforts to get out of bed transitioned into a wild sprint for the toilet as everything I'd eaten the day before fought its way up. I was going to be late for work, so I skipped the coffee stop. As I was driving by, the memory of the smell and taste of that coffee   from the day before washed over me. There was a short line in front of the little bus, and the same girl who I'd seen the day before was leaning out the window again. Only instead of looking into the car at the window, she was looking at me.

And she wasn't smiling.

Being late for work meant that I was twice as busy as usual. I probably would have caught up sooner if I hadn't been fixated on getting another coffee at lunch. Every few minutes I was checking the clock. It didn't matter if it took my whole lunch break, I had to go back. 

Finally, my lunch break came. The afternoon sun was up, but just as before, the bus looked abandoned. Only this time, the window never opened. I waited my whole half-hour lunch break and the window never opened.

When I got back to work, I went to see my boss and told her that I was sick (which was actually still true) and needed to go home and sleep it off. She didn't seem to have a problem with it. As I was cleaning my area to leave, my friend Dan came and asked me what was up.

I should never have told him or anyone else about that coffee. He thought I was joking when I told him that the real reason I wasn't able to focus was because of a cup of coffee I had the day before. Maybe I *was* sick. I went home and tried to relax.

The next day was Friday, and I woke up feeling back to normal. I made breakfast and coffee at home, and while it wasn't as good as the one from Cofee, it did the job. On my drive to work, I thought that today would be no problem. When I passed the lot where the Volkswagen was parked, I saw that it was gone. I felt an unjustified panic seize my chest.

At work, I started noticing that several people had coffee cups with the unique wagon wheel design. Everyone seemed to love it as much as I had. When I left that night, I saw why - the green van was now parked in the back of our parking lot.

On Monday, I arrived at work to find an empty parking lot. The doors to work were still locked. I waited around for almost an hour but finally left when I saw a familiar green Volkswagen bus slowly pass by.

The police wouldn't listen when I told them that it was the coffee that killed them. They said that it was some kind of poisonous gas leak under the building that wouldn't show up in an autopsy. They never even tried to find "Cofee" or the strange girl who worked there.

As I said, this all happened last Fall; almost a year ago. The reason I wanted to tell you this is because I just saw the same black dog on my way to work yesterday, and I'm worried that Fall is coming again.

 Hey, I just found this sub today. I'm just looking for some quick sketches and ideas that I can work with. The subreddit is /r/NoSleepReruns, so I want the header to be creepy and involve a television.

Something like [Sean Coss](http://www.newgrounds.com/art/view/shawncoss/i-can-always-make-you-smile?context=ratings:etm.user:3578403.scouted:.offset:33)'s artwork, or Stephen Gammell would be super awesome, but not required.

http://i.imgur.com/zqESne8.png

I'm really excited to see what you come up with! Thank you in advance!

The girl opened her pack and extracted a fat green bottle wrapped in fur. It was one she'd used several times before for this exact dark purpose. The crumbling cork slid loosely out of the opening. She crouched next to the lifeless body at her feet, her tight leather armor creaking softly as she moved. With a muffled word and a mysterious swish of her hand, the air in front of her glowed softly, then faded.

With a frustrated swear, she repeated the charm. The light glowed a little brighter this time and Jarod, standing in the shadows, thought that he could just see the outline of a tortured face being framed in the glow. This spell faded as well, and the girl swore louder. Jarod couldn't see why the blonde thief would even bother. This area had hosted several wars throughout the years and remains were plentiful; one only needed to look around the cave that they were in to know that. Wasting an enchanted bottle to capture this spirit wouldn't bring her any fortune, especially from here. No, this was something else.

On the third try, the thief's spell illuminated a satisfied smile on her face and caused Jarod to slink behind a pile of bones. The face, glowing in the darkness, was stretched and almost as thin as the skulls lining the walls. She began to reel the spirit into the bottle with one waving hand. Obviously clumsy with magic, her brow pinched in concentration. Jarod thought how easy it would be to incapacitate the girl right now. He had cause; the body she knelt over had belonged to his mentor, a silver-robed mage that had earned some renown in a long-ago age. Therein lied the reason that Jarod stayed his attack. The apprentice felt that he had long ago gleaned all he could from the old man with his strict code and laws, and finding him dead at a cutpurse's hand lifted his spirits.

Her work was complete. She carefully wrapped the glowing bottle and set it into her bag with the rest of her collection, considered the cavern around her and set out, her new shadow creeping along the tunnels behind her.

The town of Zale, where Jarod and his master had come was due east. The girl struck a path to the south through the woods. He admired how at home she seemed to be, even as she avoided the main paths. Early on, he had summoned a sphere of silence around himself so that the girl wouldn't hear him breaking branches and twigs. Her own magic seemed to be grounded in her skill and dexterity; he hadn't heard her once. For reasons he couldn't fully explain, he was captivated by the girl; her beauty seemed to grow with each obstacle she overcame.

He began to feel the length of the trek taking its toll. Briars and branches had claimed the hem of his robe, and his cloth shoes, once cobalt blue were now brown and caked with mud. His mark emerged from the trees onto a wide dirt road. Her pace had never slowed in the brush, but now she clipped along even faster.

The road ended in a wide, flat valley that housed a community of small farms. In the center of the valley, a group of huddled buildings stood above than the rest. The sun was setting on the hills framing the village. Against its glow, the girl's silhouette disappeared into one of the buildings. That was fine by Jarod.

For twelve years the young mage had studied under his old master. Creatures, places, artifacts, scrolls, tomes... It had been an endless cycle, a tedious life. He intended to study the girl in her own environment, untainted by his observation, as he would have studied a Pixie or a Bogg Toad. He wasn't in search of companionship; he only wanted to know her, while enjoying the power that anonymity afforded him. That power swirled and mixed with the feeling of freedom inflating in his chest as he found his way to the cluster of buildings.

The only building with light and activity coming from within it was an inn that doubled as a tavern and a small trading post. A squat, mustached man frowned at Jarod's undeniably impractical and dirty clothes from behind a wooden counter. In the next room was a tavern where hardy farmers were gathered around handmade tables where they were loudly sharing cups and tales.

Jarod's hand made a subtle movement and the mustached man's frown became dulled and the light left his eyes. "I'll be needing a room and clothes. You don't need to know my name or my business, only that I wish to be left alone." He set a pile of coins on the wooden countertop. "I am quite sure that this will be sufficient to cover my stay. My key, please."

---

A short time later, Jarod descended the stairs wearing black pants and boots with a forest green traveling cloak. The noise from the small pub rose up the steps to greet him. Ignoring the man at the counter, he grabbed the handle of the door to leave. Jarod released the handle and his hand slowly dropped to his side. He turned his focus back to the bar. Standing there, next to a group of men at the table, was the one he'd been following. He walked into the bar and pulled out an empty chair at one of the tables - the only empty chair in the room. The strangers stared at him for a moment, but Jarod's gaze was fixed on the girl as she went from table to table, laughing and joking with the men she obviously knew. Her dexterity and finesse were obvious here as well, and her beauty more so. Two of the others at Jarod's table went back to their stories. The third tapped him on the shoulder with enough force to .

In normal circumstances, the mage would have resented the uncalled for touch, but the discomfort of his clothes was a constant reminder that he was in disguise. He swallowed his discomfort and looked toward the man. A thick beard was soaked with mead, and he smelled like dirt and sweat. "She's somethin' huh?"

"Something... Yes. Do you know her?"

"Sure do. That's the girl I'm gonna marry."

"You are her betrothed?"

"Well... no. She doesn't actually know me jus' yet. Gotta work up a little courage is all."

"You've never actually met her, then?"

"Oh, I met 'er. She... might not 'a got my name right..."

"I see."

"She's such a cute li'l thing. Her family's got a farm back toward the red hill." The young man tried to focus through his inebriation in order to take in Jarod's appearance. Before he could finish, the girl had appeared beside the table.

"Hi, Bill. Mort." She nodded to the old men at the table. "Another drink for both of you?" Both nodded and went back to their conversation. "And you two... well, hello. I don't believe I've seen you here before" she said, looking at Jarod. "Brothers?" Jarod glanced at the other man ogling the girl. Thick arms and shoulders flanked a barrel-chest with a wild blond beard hanging over it. The two could not have been more dissimilar.

"Ah, no. Afraid not. I'd like to purchase a drink for my new friend..." Jarod dragged out the last line, hoping that the lovestruck man at his side would offer a name. It didn't come, but the object of his affection kindly ignored the awkward pause. 

As she left, the the oldest man at the table leaned over toward Jarod. "Ye don' want to be gettin' yer hopes up with tha' one," he slurred. "Strange, she is."

"Hear tell she's a necker-mancer," the fourth man whispered loudly enough to hear over the din of the crowded room.

"She ain't no necromancer! She's a *collector*. She collects things 'n puts 'em up in her ol' man's barn.

"Well, her ma an' 'er ol' man are weird ones too. Whole family of 'em out by Red Hill."

"Point bein'... Ye're best to leave 'er alone." At this, the bearded man looked slightly crestfallen. The barmaid arrived with the drinks and smiled at everyone else at the table before locking her gaze onto Jarod. For several seconds, she just stared. Jarod shifted in his seat and felt himself start to sweat. The moment passed and her smile returned before leaving.

"She winked at me!" shouted the bearded man. She certainly hadn't, but no one was cold enough to correct him.

"You said that she's a 'collector,' what did you mean by that?"

"Naw, I said she a '*necker*-man-"

"Shut up, Mort! I already told ya, she's not a necromancer." The man turned back to Jarod. "Her an' her family aren't from here. They came from some place I never heard of. That was 'bout four, five years ago now. So they show up outta the blue, and they buy a farm and then stuff just start disappearing."

"Stuff?"

The blonde walked close by the group's table and the man telling the story lowered his voice, ominously. "Yeah, stuff. Had about five of us out in the woods picking this certain kind o' mushroom. We sit down for some lunch and when we get to movin' again, no' one of us can find our bags. A whole morning's work, gone."

"Oy, I 'ad somebody trod off with me flask once. D'ya think-"

"I r'member yer flask well enough, Mort. I r'member 'cause I saw it fall in the lake when we was out fishin'." Bill shot him a look to silence him, but the man was occupied trying to pull something out of his pockets. "As I was sayin'- er... what was I sayin'?"

"So you think they stole your mushrooms?"

"Not just the mushrooms. People started to notice they were losin' their stuff from all over town. Their old stuff. Like Grappler's gran gave 'im a locket from 'afore the war, Brawn had a set o' armor his pa gave 'im. I 'ad a nice knife from me ma... used it fer cuttin' carrots. Stuff that was right inside peoples' homes, an' it just went missin'."

"You think she's got somrthing to do with it?"

"Well I dunno if it's *her* exactly's doin' it, but she's got the stuff in her old man's barn, that's fer sure."

"Yeah 'n my flask! It were green 'n fat."

"Was it glass?" Jarod asked.

"Yeah! How'd you guess that?" the man asked in wonder.

Without pausing, he responded "If it had been metal, surely the two of you would have been able to recover it when it fell into the lake." Bill laughed loud and drunkenly. Jarod followed the girl with his eyes for a while. "So, Bill, if everything is there in the barn, why hasn't anyone gone in and taken it back?"

Bill looked around him, lowered his head so that the tip of his beard just dipped into his cup of ale, but didn't lower his voice whatsoever. "It's haunted."

Jarod perked up at this, pulling his gaze from the girl. Mort burst out, "See! That's what I' been tryin'a say. She's a necker-"

"She ain't!"

"Well then what's that I seen her doin'-"

"You ain't seen shit, Mort."

"Please," Jarod ventured softly. "I'd like to hear what Mort here has to say."

It was Mort's turn to scowl at Bill, and he relished in the moment for a long second. "As I say. I seen the girl ou' in the woods one night, 'n I think she might'a been hunting 'cause there were something dead by 'er. So's she stops 'n pulls out this little bottle - blue, like the sky - and starts wavin' her hands and sayin' some kind o' spell. Then outta nowheres, that dead thing's spirit starts floatin' up, glowin' real bright in the dark, and she stuffs the thing into her blue bottle. I think that dead thing was a man... but I never went close enough to see. Ye' ever hear anything like it?"

"Actually, I have."

"Told you!" shouted Mort.

"Now hold on! The mister din't say boo 'bout necromancers yet."

"Sorry, Mort. I don't think that she is a necromancer. I don't think that she's much of a magician at all, actually. There are simple charms that one can procure to give the power to capture a departed soul in an enchanted container. Now, do you know of why she might want to do such a thing?" Jarod allowed their silence to linger a moment before answering his own question. 

"Because she's a collector."

A smile spread back into Bill's face. "Yeah!"

The souls that she had taken were nearly worthless, but they might have contained sentimental value. However, if he could get inside the barn where she kept it, he may yet find some artifacts of worth.

Oddly, not a single customer had left the tavern yet. The starstruck young man had fallen asleep, a line of drool was strung from his beard to the table, and nearly hung to the ground.

Jarod stood, his drink was only half-finished, but he felt his balance waver for a moment.

The cool air of night blew across his body. He supposed for a moment that he should have asked where exactly the barn was, however it wasn't necessary. The mage had other means. The soft orange lights of the tiny town shrank behind him. In the darkness, he thrust his hand high into the air, feeling for the pulse of magic. Puzzled, Jarod lowered his hand. He felt magic all around him.

In the field beside him he heard rustling. It was getting closer. The young mage raised his hands in front of him, ready to react with fire and wind to whatever may come from the tall plants.

The soul thief emerged. She was wearing her thieves' leather again. Seemingly oblivious to Jrod's presence, she plodded down the road in front of him.

Jarod tried to count the number of things that had made him feel uneasy today. He traced the girl's writhe silhouette in the light, and forgot to feel uneasy. He followed.

Though something was interfering with his senses, Jarod didn't require a spell to know that the barn that he was approaching was something special. It simply hummed with mystery. Looking directly at it, the structure appeared normal. If he looked through the corner of his eyes, it appeared to have a faint glow just at the edges, as though it was filled with light and the corners sprung a leak.

Jarod was examining this phenomenon when a black boulder rolled from the edge of the road and on top of him, knocking the air of his lungs and pinning him to the ground. The boulder grabbed him began slam his head into the dirt again and again.

"Shane! Shane, stop it!"

The young mage, trapped under the huge, bearded man could not clear his head long enough to form a word or thought. He could think only of his burning, empty lungs until the weight cleared off of him.

"What are you doing?!"

"Ye know my name!" said Shane, equal parts surprised and elated.

"I know plenty, except what you're doing here!"

"Well I sees this guy in the pub an' he's watching you all night 'n then he gets up to leave. On'y he doesn't go up to 'is room, he goes outside. I was thinkin' it was a little strange to be sneakin' around at night. So I follow 'im, an' he starts comin' to your barn."

"I see. That's enough, Shane." The thief craned her neck to look down at Jarod with malice. "And you."

Jarod lay on the ground, still stunned. Something in his chest felt broken, and the pain dulled his usually sharp wit.

"You've been following me ever since I left the bar?" She pulled out a long, wickedly curved knife from her belt. "You had better start talking."

"Wait. No, I..." He struggled a moment to get to his feet, causing Shane to shift uncomfortably beside him. Jarod put his hands up in front of him as a gesture of surrender. For a practitioner of magic, however, the motion had a much different meaning. "I was drawn toward something in that barn."

"*My* barn. How do you mean, 'drawn?' Are you a wizard or something?" The knife glinted in the moonlight as her deft fingers twirled around the handle.

"A wizard?" Jarod forced a laugh. "No, no. I'm nowhere near old enough for that sort of thing. My name is Leopold Pozy, travelling musician," he finished with an exaggerated bow.

"Musician, huh? Let's 'ere a song."

"Well you see, Shane, is it? Shane, and..."

"Lexi."

"Shane, Lexi, this is the very problem which has drawn me here. I have hit a bit of a dry spell, a writer's block, a patch of creative impedance which prevents me from performing."

Jarod had seen a silver-tongued traveling musician once. He'd snuck out of the tower late at night when he was a child. Having never been out of the building, he had aimlessly walked the streets, imagining every circumstance when he might need to summon a fireball. The muddy roads had brought him to a pub where the most beautiful music and smells were wafting into the streets. Jarod stood, peering through the foggy windows of the tavern for over an hour. When the music stopped, the bard had come to speak with him. Jarod had felt in awe of how eloquent the performer was. He thought of that night as he spoke, and hoped to the gods that his speech was moving.

"I found my inspiration in the bar today; a beautiful girl with haunting grace. The rumors swirling about her proved almost as interesting as the girl herself. Rumors that seem to include the barn in question. "

"You're a terrible liar."

"Pardon me?"

"You want to see my barn, huh?" The knife stopped in her hand, and she clutched it in a slim, white-knuckled fist. "Very well. We'll all go and see what's in there, to put these rumors to rest."

Jarod's heart felt like it would beat out of his chest in excitement. His late master had always forbidden him from interacting with people outside the tower. Yet, here he was, without even using magic, he was able to get the things he wanted.

After a short walk, the three stood before the huge doors of the structure. The mage detected a faint humming in the air, and the light was more apparent now.

Lexi gripped one wooden door, while Shane grabbed the other. The doors slid silently apart, revealing only darkness. Jarod peered ahead, squinting and turning his head, but could see nothing beyond the opening. Lexi ushered him inside with a wave of her hand. As Jarod crossed the threshold, he began to see shelves lining the walls of the barn, reaching far over his head. Dark objects were crowded along them, stretching all around the structure, covering every inch of the walls.

Straight ahead in the shadows was something larger. He could only the dark silhouette against the shelves. It moved, slightly, and before Jarod realized that it was coming closer to him, a firm hand had grabbed his wrist. He tried to spin away just in time to see the barn doors slammed shut behind him.

With an explosion of sound, Jarod summoned a fireball. He was forced to close his eyes against the white light and heat, and burned into his eyelids was the image of a person in a robe. No, not a person. A mage.

Marcus the Silver, returned from the dead.

Jarod's fear possessed him, and he just managed to tear his arm away and scramble into the complete blackness. He thought of another spell; held it in his mind, ready to use it. From somewhere in front of him a terrible laughter came. He threw the spell, a series of tiny points of condensed energy slowly went forth from each of his fingertips, searching for a living thing to cling to. Their faint, shimmering light showed only an empty barn before winking out.

"YOU FOOL!" his master's voice shook the walls of the barn all around Jarod, things crashed as they fell off the shelves. The terrified mage backed against the wall. "You abandoned me," came a whisper in his ear, causing him to crawl and run forward into the center. He released another stream of fire, the impact blowing a hole clean through the wall of the barn and catching some of the things on the shelf aflame.

More laughter came, swirling and pulsing around him from all directions. Shadows moved across the walls, specters flew through the air over his head. The fire spread quickly, dropping onto the dry hay-covered floor of the barn. "What are you?!" Jarod shouted, unable to follow any of the hundreds of shadows with his eyes.

"I am death itself," the silver mage said, emerging from the flames.

"I'm sorry!"

"Sorry," he spat. "Weak. You are no apprentice of mine, just a traitorous cur needing to be put down."

"No!"

More shapes lurked in the flames behind the old man, the walls of the barn disappeared in the white light. Lexi, spinning her wicked dagger. Shane, slamming his fist into the palm of his other hand. The two old men from the bar, still sitting at the table, talking excitedly. More shapes milled around, seemingly ignorant of the flames all around him.

The barn walls spun around Jarod. He was in the cave again, surrounded by piles of bones and skulls. Lexi was there, coaxing the glowing spirit. Marcus's voice came unseen from the shadows, "You have ignored all that I have ever taught you. Here is the thief, bottling my departed spirit. Instead of defending me, your gracious master, you follow her! Chasing her further into the illusion of my creation, never once able to recognize that the world around you is a farce. Never questioning."

The cave spun around him. He was in the bar, watching himself from the corner of the room. He sat at an empty table, carrying on a conversation with the empty chairs around him. The walls of the pub faded, and he saw himself sitting in a grassy marsh, sitting on a stump, his robes soaked with filth. He looked like someone who had lost their mind.

The scene shifted around Jarod, and he was back in the barn. The flames were all around him now, he tried to shield his face and body with his arms against the intense heat, and he felt that he could hardly breathe. "Master!" he choked. "Save me!"

At once, the flames disappeared. The barn around him was empty, and moonlight filtered in through the open door. Jarod looked at himself. He was wearing the robes he'd worn at the cave, covered in swampy filth. Cautiously, he made his way out the door of the barn.

In every direction stretched an open grassy plain. Ahead, with his back turned toward Jarod, stood the mage in wavy, silver robes. Jarod stumbled up behind him, watching closely for any movement of the old man.

"Remember this day. For as long as you breathe, you will not receive a second chance." The old mage was gone. Behind him, the barn had disappeared as well. Jarod dropped to his knees and wept under the stars.

---

Lexi watched the young mage as he wept on his knees. She opened her eyes, and saw the body of the man in silver robes lying on the stone ground before her. Flies had begun to feast on the corpse, and in the hours since his death, a stench had filled the cave, more than usual.

Looking on the corpse, she thought of the advice her mother had given her study of the magical arts had first begun. *There are two kinds of magicians that exist in the world. Those who are alive, and those who are dead.*

The Silver had been too dangerous to keep alive, coming into her domain, searching too closely. She smoothed the front of her robes, and retreated deeper into the caves, her mind put at ease knowing that Jarod would never find his way back to her. She had set in motion for him a perpetual state of illusion, sustained by his own mind. The entity he'd formed in his mind of Marcus the Silver was now the image that he'd see for the rest of his life. For him, Marcus would never die.

Entering her chamber, the illusionist set the common green bottle onto its place on her shelf. Too often, the simplest illusion was the strongest. The secret behind any lie was that people see what they want to see, or are afraid that they might.

When the Silver had come into the caves, she'd adopted the persona of the young thief, the bottle and the "soul" were used as props to lend credibility to her disguise. As Marcus had thought that he was sneaking up behind a distracted thief, she'd struck him down. Noise still echoed around the caves. The second mage coming and planned to use the same deception. 

She couldn't say exactly why she'd spared the young mage. Perhaps she felt pity for him, blinded as he was by arrogance. It was a happy coincidence that the man, Mort, had crossed her path a month earlier. She had been able to use his memories to create the illusion of the town and the rest of the bar patrons. The poor man had stumbled into his own perpetual illusion at her hands. Lexi sighed, and cast her eyes along the hundreds of other items on her shelves, each representing a person caught in one of her webs, then made her way to bed. 














 There was this girl at the bar.

I know how that sounds, but she was different, strange, *alien*. I tried to talk to her, but... she just stared at me, silent. 

I left alone, but saw her again in my dreams. As I slept, she came through my bedroom window.

 Hi everyone! I just wanted to give you a quick update. 

**First off, we hit 100 subscribers! Hooray!**

Amazing. /r/nosleep really has one of the greatest communities supporting it.

If you've been here for long, you'll probably notice that I've been less active in posting stories here lately. That's because I'm helping moderate a few other subreddits and just haven't spent the same amount of time digging into nosleep. **I've been slacking.**

**But you know who *HAS* been digging through /r/nosleep for the best stories it has to offer?**

**Your faithful staff at /r/NosleepIndex!**

I can't say enough good things about what the (*creepy?*) staff's doing over there. If you don't know what **[The Index](http://www.reddit.com/r/NosleepIndex/wiki/index)** is, it's a compilation of all the series posts on nosleep.

Their most recent project is the **[Nosleep Archive](http://www.reddit.com/r/NosleepIndex/wiki/archive)**. Look at it. Seriously. Do it. Go there. If you're here to find a definitive "Best Of" /r/nosleep... It's there.

**So if The Archive is the "Best Of" nosleep, what's going to happen to NoSleepReruns?**

I'm so glad you asked. This month I tried something different on Reruns by getting rid of the requirement for stories to be "underrated." That's coming back, and Reruns is getting back to its roots. **/r/NoSleepReruns will be the place for people to share their favorite underrated, undiscovered and underappreciated stories from nosleep**... again

I want that story that the writer poured everything into, that got one upvote and a downvote and dropped off the frontpage. I want the story that *you* were the only person who ever read, but you thought it was great, and it made you afraid of the dark the next night.

Since Reruns is going be re-focused your submissions, I'm changing the format so that the public can create posts. That means *you!*

Now, [what are you still doing here?](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleepindex)

 My wife and I went camping last Friday. She died on Sunday and it is all my fault. I was the one who brought us here to the woods and in doing so, doomed us both. Three of us, if you include the new life swelling in her belly. 

We should have left that first night. The first time we saw one of *them.* It was a tiny creature, starved, filthy and wet. When the thing came begging at our tent, it was pity, peppered with hope from our own coming child that moved us take it in. We both agreed without saying a word that we'd try to reunite the pitiful little thing with its family. We were so wrong. 

I can at least take some comfort in my darling's words as she lay bleeding. 

"You could not have known."

I fear that she was right. Who could have known, save for some cold, distant God? No man could escape from these woods, me among them. I am damned.

I can hear them now, their treble laughter wafting through the darkness, creeping closer, poised just out of sight, playing with me in a cat and mouse game. Soon it will be over. Soon, the children who own these woods will come and remove me from this world.  




 This is something I wrote for /r/nosleep a couple of months ago. People didn't seem to understand what had happened. What do you think?

Any feedback is appreciated.

"No Pets Allowed"

That's what the sign had said in the rental office. I was pissed. Of course, on the quick tour of the apartment, I hadn't had time to find the dog food and collar that someone had left behind the stacking washer and dryer. Why a dog? Why couldn't it have been a cat? I'm not allergic to cats. I hadn't had any sneezing or itching eyes yet that first night, but I expected that the first time I vacuumed and stirred up all the dander settled under the carpets, I'd also be stirring up my own personal hell.

I thought about leaving, or getting a different apartment, but I knew realistically that there wasn't one. The nearby university had been growing faster than the housing market, and if I left now, with Spring term just a couple days away... I didn't even want to think about it. Not to mention the fact that I'd just spent all day moving my things in. No, I was staying.

Best to go back to the rental office, complain and hope for a carpet deep-cleaning. I picked up the dog food and collar and put them in a plastic bag. I tried to pick up as much hair as I could out of the corner as well. Tomorrow, I'd go there and let them have a piece of my mind.

3/24/2014

I ran into my neighbor as I was leaving the house. I'm in 150a, and he's in 150b. He had long hair and was standing outside smoking. Since I was carrying the bag, I held it up (in what might have been an accusatory way) and asked if the previous person who lived here had had a dog. He said that if she did, that they'd kept it hidden. He'd never heard anything. He looked like a pot smoker though, so I wonder if he would have even noticed.

The young girl at the front desk of the rental office said that she couldn't do anything about it until the owners got back at 4:00. I told her to have them call me. By 8:00, I had abandoned all hope of that happening.

Night #2 in the new place. I stayed up late (well, late for me) watching movies and putting off unpacking. At about 1:00 in the morning, I turned in for the night. Any question of how thick the walls were between 150a and 150b were quickly answered, as I heard a steady thump like music while I laid in bed. By 1:45, I was alternating between fed up and amazed. Who can listen to one techno song, loudly, for this long? At about 3:00 am I drifted off to sleep.

3/25/2014

"Shit. Literal, actual, shit, is all over my attic." The girl at the rental office was useless. It wasn't her fault that she couldn't do anything, but I didn't care.

That morning, I'd seen 150b outside, smoking again so I went to ask him about his music. I was pretty sure that he was lying when he said he wasn't even home last night, and hadn't had any music on "for sure." When I went back inside, I heard the steady rhythm again. Like a pissed off soccer mom, I power-walked over to his front door to try to catch him in the act, but when he opened the door... there was no music.

Mr. Helpful from 150b followed me back to my apartment in order to "help me find the music." He reeked like pot. I knew it. Back in the living room of 150a, the pulsing sound was louder than ever. 150b proudly announced that the sound was coming from the attic.

There must have been a raccoon or something in the attic, because when he came down, the thumping had stopped and he was holding something in his bare hand.

"Something," in this case, was a hunk of feces, one of hundreds spread around the small attic in small piles.

3/26/2014

Last night, a noise outside my room woke me up at around 3:00 am. I rolled over and brushed it off until I heard something moving around in my kitchen. Thinking that it was a raccoon or cat from the attic, I threw open my bedroom door, charged into the kitchen and turned on the light, all while yelling. 

A horrible, piercing scream rang in my ears, and in front of me, scrambling back under the kitchen table was a terrified child wearing dark and dirty clothes. I screamed in shock and if my legs hadn't buckled, I'd have run straight out the back door.

I fell against the wall, and involuntarily sat on the boxes I'd left there. The screaming stopped, and I took in the fact that there was a long cable, the kind that people use to tie up their dogs outside, that was snaking like a tail across my kitchen floor. One end was frayed, but the other led up to a collar around the child's neck. Also on the floor, were the shattered remains of a ceramic bowl.

3/27/2014

When I came back to the rental office to pick up my refund check, I noticed that they had amended their sign in permanent marker:

"*Only One Resident Per Unit* No Pets *or Children* Allowed." 









 I think we're all wondering when the next WvW thread is going to emerge,  as well as hoping that nothing is wrong with /u/Realistics. In the meantime, I thought it would be fun to run our own, informal WvW round in which anyone can participate.

**Prompt:** Where in the world is /u/Realistics?  
**Submission Deadline:** Wednesday, May 14.  
**Voting Deadline:** Friday, May 16.  
**Target Length:** ~750 words.

Edit: Last day for submissions is coming up! Thanks, mods, for the sticky.

Still wishing all the best to /u/Realistics. S/He definitely has some clever stories to come back to.

Edit 2: Great stories! I hope you all had fun, I did. Look out for another sign-up post in the future. Just the sign-ups, though, then I'll disappear too. 









 Thanks, all. I'm always impressed by the amount of talent here. 




 My friends and I used to go explore abandoned buildings. We'd been to some houses, stayed the night in a cabin in the woods, and wandered the halls of an old office building. But there was nothing like the old hospital.

Inside, it was everything we'd hoped for. A lot of things had been left behind, and it even had that sterile smell like a hospital. We came in through the main chapel, where the intricate panes of a stained glass window lay in shattered pieces on the ground. We wandered through reception and the nurse's station. Found a break area with torn couches and a broken television. The whole experience of being there fell perfectly somewhere between thrilling and creepy.

Then we went up to the second floor. The hallway there formed a big loop with rooms on either side. Overnight-stay rooms for patients, labs, test equipment, stock rooms and offices. All the doors we tried were locked. Just before we called it quits and headed back down, we saw a streak of yellow light spill out across the hall from under one of the doors.

"Hello?" I shouted, my voice echoing down the hall.

The sliver of light grew wider. A woman in filthy blue scrubs stepped out. Her tangled, greasy hair hung over her face and we couldn't tell if she was looking at us or not. She slowly turned away, and shuffled down the hall, disappearing around the corner and into the darkness. 









 Sometimes, I randomly get a pain. It's like an itch that I've got to scratch and in a moment it's gone. I always thought that it was just a random thing before today. 

I was "people-watching." For no reason in particular, I tracked one man through the crowd with my eyes. There was nothing strange about him. I'd probably passed a dozen people who looked and dressed just like him today without giving them a second glance. As I watched, I noticed that every person he came close to suddenly rubbed their skin like they had that random pain. That itch. 

Before he left, he threw something in the trash. I was curious. I hadn't noticed him carrying anything before. So I went to the garbage can and looked. And there, right on top of the food court wrappers and paper cups, I saw it. A tiny syringe. 




 I shivered myself awake. I was in my car, in a 7-Eleven parking lot, but I didn't remember driving anywhere. I didn't remember anything. I decided to get some coffee to fight off the chill and think over what happened last night.

I went to the 7-Eleven. As she rang up the coffee, the cashier pointed to the right side of her neck. "You've got something..." I rubbed my neck with my hand, and pulled away some black flakes of dried blood.

In my car again, I felt gently around the cut just behind my ear. I thought that I felt something about the size of a Tic-Tac under the skin. I tried to squeeze it out, pressing the sides of the thing like a zit. It squirted out. The tiny black object shot into the mess of garbage on the floor of the car. 

While looking for something to clean off the blood, I noticed an unfamiliar magazine and another 7-Eleven receipt on the passenger's seat. I stuck a napkin on my neck, and opened the magazine.

Colorful pictures of tattoos were on nearly every page. I came across one that looked liked it had been scribbled in permanent marker, and took a closer look. It was a bright, full-page picture of the side of a pale, skinny head. There were words written on the page of the magazine in Sharpie..

*They're coming back for you.*

There was an arrow to a spot behind the man's ear.

*Cut here.*

*Run.* 




 I shivered myself awake. It was dark and cold. The kind of chill that sinks deep inside your body and saps your energy.

I was in my car, but didn't remember driving anywhere the night before. I also didn't seem to have crashed. I was just parked next to a 7-Eleven. I checked my phone. 06:15; 7% battery remaining; no missed calls; no weird text messages.

I shivered again. Since I was already there, I decided to get some coffee to shake off the chill and think over what happened last night. As I got out of the car, a dizzy spell came over me. My eyesight went dark and I had to put a hand on the roof to brace myself. I must have stood up too fast, I thought. I waited for it to clear the rest of the way and went inside.

I entered to the familiar two-tone motion sensor chime and headed to the coffee bar. On my left, I noticed that the cashier was still sporting the unkempt remains of Mustache March. Also, I noticed that they were a woman. 

One other person was in the store, carefully choosing something from the glass drink case. We got to the counter about the same time. Him with his illegal-in-several-states size energy drink and me with my I-didn't-intend-to-get-up-this-early coffee cup. I stopped short, letting him check out first. He smiled politely, and set his drink on the counter, causing the cashier to look up from her phone with a sigh. The man in line looked back at me quizzically.

"You've got something..." He pointed to the right side of his neck. I rubbed my neck with my hand, and pulled away some black flakes like dried-on mud.

"Thanks" I mumbled back, feeling slightly embarrassed and unsure of how much more remained.

When the mustachioed lady rang up my coffee, she looked me over then pulled out a magazine from under the register and added it to my total.

"Wait. What's that?"

"What? You forget?"  She raised her eyebrow like I was stupid. "You were just in here a couple hours ago, said you couldn't pay but you'd come back for it."

"Oh. Sorry, yeah. Actually, I don't remember anything from last -"

"So you don't got the money again?"

"Yeah. Of course. Here." I handed her my debit card.

I took my coffee and magazine (*Tattoo Magazine*, boasting a picture of a heavily inked and sparsely-clothed girl on the cover) and went to my car. When I got in, I pulled down the little vanity mirror in the visor to check the spot on my neck. I was surprised to find that what I'd thought was dirt was actually a trickle of dried blood from a small cut just behind my ear. I pulled on my ear and tried unsuccessfully to get a look at it. When I let go, there was a strange tension under the skin before everything slid back into place.

I felt gently around the cut. It was puffy around the wound, but I thought that I felt something about the size of a Tic-Tac inside. I tried to squeeze it out, pressing the sides of the cut like a big zit. Pain shot down my neck and temple, but eventually it squirted out. My hand was slippery with blood, and the tiny object shot into the mess of garbage on the floor of the car. 

Freshly opened, the small cut bled and bled. While looking for something in my car to clean it with, I briefly considered using the magazine, but went for an old fast food napkin I'd found instead.

I still couldn't remember anything from the night before, but the magazine seemed like a really strange choice for me. I don't think I'd even looked twice at Tattoo Magazine before, let alone paid for one. With the hand that wasn't occupied by the napkin, I flipped through the glossy pages. 

Inside was pretty much what you'd expect. Colorful pictures and elaborate designs were on nearly every page with interviews and articles scattered here and there. I quickly skimmed each page, still clueless as to why I might have wanted to buy it earlier. Most of the tattoos were excellently done, so when I came across one that looked liked it had been scribbled in permanent marker, I took a closer look.

It was a bright, full-page picture of a pale, skinny man's head from the side. On his neck, was a tattoo of a super-realistic tree frog, but what really stopped my heart were the words written in Sharpie on the page of the magazine.

*They're coming back for you.*

There was an arrow to a spot behind the man's ear.

*Cut here.*

*Run.* 














 Just getting into writing more seriously, and I want some general feedback on what I have so far. Everything on that site is a connected story, but The Old Hospital parts should stand well enough on their own. It's a horror story, and the violence ramps up in Part 3. Thanks in advance.

I looked at Ryan and then back to rippling water in the doorway. No one was supposed to be there.  No one was there; we'd just been through every other room in the decrepit clinic.

A person would have had to come straight here like they knew where they were going. A person without a light. A person who didn't give a shit about seeing two men with flashlights in an office in the basement of a hospital that had been abandoned for over 20 years.

Or maybe it wasn't a person.

Ryan had moved his hand to his police-issue Glock, but otherwise stood frozen. The ripples in the hallway dissipated. "Ryan," I whispered as quietly as I could. My voice was the first sound audible in thirty seconds, and despite my best attempt, it shattered the silence like a pane of glass. Ryan didn't respond, except for a flick of his eyes to me and then back to the door. I took it to mean that he'd heard me. "Did you see it?"

"No."

"Is someone here?"

"... Maybe."

I took a step toward where Ryan was, close to the door. I could feel the numbingly cold water up to my mid-calf swirl around my boots. And hear it. Whatever was in the hall had to have been moving very slowly in order to keep quiet.

Ryan jutted his head out into the hall. He held his hand backwards like a relay runner reaching for the baton. I struck the weighty Maglite into his palm, which he pointed down the hall. Right, left. He looked back at me.

"Let's go. Slow. Quiet. It went to the end of the hall and to the right." I could barely hear Ryan's whisper.

I nodded and followed him out into the hallway. We took one step at a time, hugging the wall, making tiny waves in the black water but remaining silent. The term "silent as the grave" forced its way into my brain. All I could hear was my own breath inside my head. The pace was excruciatingly slow.

About 40 feet past the office door we'd left was another, larger, doorway. Beyond that, the hallway ended against another cement wall with a dark brown window set into it. A ventilation duct, I guessed.

We slowly approached the open double doorway. The beams of the flashlights barely touched the wall inside it - more flat, gray cement. As we got closer, the light panned around the room. A couple of rusted, metal, rolling tray tables. An I.V. fluid stand.

Ryan stopped and pulled his gun from its holster. I could hear his sharp intake of breath. He held it, his arms so tense that they shook. I heard splashing from the room ahead.

"FREEZE!" The word boomed through the empty hallway.

*I can't see, oh god, what is that, is that a person, what the fuck are they doing there, what the fuck are they doing what the fuck, fuck, fuck.*

"Who are you?" Echoed Ryan's voice again.

I nearly lost control of my bladder when I heard the voice that responded.

"Hello," a woman's voice, tonal but raspy like sandpaper brushed along a metal pipe, spoke from the darkness. "Yes? Can I help you?"

More splashing, someone's legs as they waded through the water.

"Ma'am, stop where you are."

"Ohhh, am I in some sort of trouble?"

Ryan paused, seeming unsure of how to respond. "Ma'am, it's not safe here."

"Bah," she hissed, and the wading continued.

I shifted, keeping one hand on the wall as I looked around Ryan and into the room. An old woman in all white was walking through the flooded room. Her skin was pale, criss-crossed by blue and red veins, made more noticeable by the harsh white light of the flashlight. You could see her slightly yellowed teeth through her parted, thin lips. A large, angry sore on her nose drew attention from the rest of her face. Her hair was gray, pinned up in a tight bun under a small white hat. She was wearing a nurses uniform.

"Stop." Ryan called again, his voice quieter, the panic leaking out of it.

With a frustrated movement of her hands, she huffed and turned toward Ryan. "Stop! Stop? You stop! I'm working here!" She splashed through the water again, heading toward an ancient, completely rusted operating slab in the center of the huge room. As if as an afterthought, she added, "Don't make me call the police!"

Ryan looked at me, confused fear in his eyes. Before he even said anything, I realized that he was out of his league. "I need to call someone, we need back up - an ambulance, maybe," he said half to me, half to himself. "This is wrong, something isn't right."  He retreated back into the tunnel and pulled out his cell phone. "Watch her," Ryan ordered, before slipping out of sight.

The woman had reached the operating table and went to work with long, bony hands to undo the rotted leather straps there. 

"Ma'am? Um, do you need help?" I cautiously offered. My own voice sounding strange to me in the large room. She didn't respond. 

I looked around the room. It looked like about two dozen overturned desk-chairs, the type I remembered sitting in during school were shoved against the right wall. The back was lined with shelves in bad disrepair. Ryan's voice echoed from the hallway as he argued with someone.

The woman, intent on her work, gasped and sniffed, the noise bringing my focus back to her. I saw that she seemed to be crying. I walked closer, feeling a sudden unexpected compassion for the old woman. I don't think I'd ever seen a clearer diagnosis of insanity.

She squeezed her eyes shut, shaking her hands out like a person with bad arthritis. I tried again, "Ma'am?"

"Your friend doesn't like me," she spat.

"Oh he's -"

"I think I *know* why."

She stretched the word "know" abnormally long, as if giving a small moan of pain. She reached a finger up to the sore on her nose, drawing blood from it with a long fingernail, but giving no indication that she'd noticed. "He's afraid of me. It's because I'm - I look like a -" She frowned with sadness, unable to even say the words. She moved her left hand to cover her face and turned back toward the table, continuing to scratch with her nails.

I turned back, feeling as uncomfortable as I could possibly imagine. I looked for Ryan in the hallway, but his flashlight was just a thin glow of light around the corner. The woman was crying again, louder now. When I turned my light back to her, I saw that the entire side of her nose was now shiny and red with blood. 

"I was pretty once," she moaned. She was scratching her cheeks and forehead with both hands now.

"Ryan!" I called, alarmed. I heard him splash through the water, but he didn't respond. The woman winced at some unseen pain, and gave a mournful groan.

"Ryan!" I yelled again, backing away from her. The woman reached her hands up, feeling along her face. She reached up to her hairline, just below the white nurse's cap and sunk her fingernails deep into her scalp. I could see the resistance of the skin and then the eight little *pop*s as the skin gave way, the nails sinking deep into the flesh. With a blood-curdling scream, she pulled down. The strain of it bent her neck.

I tripped backwards, landing in the hallway, splashing water onto the wall behind me. When I regained focus, the woman was sloshing forward in my direction. Her face was a mask of blood. It poured down, soaking her bleached white scrubs. Long pieces of skin stuck to her fingernails like tangled strips of scotch tape. I scrambled back to my feet, turning to run back up the way we'd come in.

I took a full step before I saw Ryan in his dark clothes, balled into the corner. Someone was standing over him in the center of the hall - another person in pure, fluorescent white. My screams reverberated off of every cement surface in the narrow hallway. I ran against the wall, backing into the corner at the end of the hall, trapped like an animal with nowhere left to run.

An explosion ripped through the underground chamber. My ears were suddenly in so much pain, I could think of nothing else. I opened my eyes again to see blood run like an open faucet from the wound Ryan's face, having taken his own life. His body slowly slid beneath the surface of the water.

Solid concrete behind me. Beneath me. Above me.

A tomb. That's what this place was.

The nurse had left the operating room. She wiped the blood from her eyes, and began to stagger toward me again. Purely on animal instinct, I tried to run again; to escape. I felt the flat wall behind me. A sharp angle dug into my left shoulder. I punched at the brown glass of the vent with my right hand, the one holding the flashlight. The window shattered, freeing years of accumulated black rot and pine needles in fetid rainwater. Everything was plunged into darkness. I dove headfirst up into the air vent. It was completely hopeless, I knew, but fear and need had taken over.

I had my head and shoulders in the hole, and groped for anything to pull myself with. Jagged pieces of glass cut across my belly. My hand brushed across something flat and metallic about four feet into the hole. I grabbed and pulled, hoisting my lower half up into the opening.  The metal handhold rotated in my hand - a fan blade. I planted my foot against the inside of the window frame and rammed my shoulder and head against the fan. The rusted metal tore away and I army-crawled further into the hole, the sides pressing uncomfortably tight against my shoulders. I pulled my legs up to my chest and away from the opening behind me. I stood up in the dark. The ceiling made a hollow metallic sound. I pushed straight up, as hard as I could, feeling the quarter-inch-thick steel cover slide away. I pulled myself up, out of the air duct, and found myself on the edge of the hospital's side parking lot.

I ran. An overdose of adrenaline commanded my legs. My body's momentum slammed into the side of Ryan's car. I yanked open the door and got in. The keys were under the visor where he'd left them. I struggled frantically to find the ignition, then started the car and tore out of the gravel parking lot. I didn't take my foot off the gas pedal until I reached the next town. 




 [Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/21s9w8/the_old_hospital_part_1/)

"Only one place left to go."

I went first, through the heavy rubber divider and down the shallow incline. At one time, the passage had been covered in 30-foot-long slip resistant rugs. Those were now visible rolled up and laying in the still water at the base of the ramp. I felt my boot threaten to slip more than once against the slick, wet surface. I reached out and touched the wall to steady myself but quickly pulled it back, wiping it on my jeans instinctively.

Everything underground was wet. The water even formed rivulets as it ran from cracks in the cement walls. I was forcibly reminded of the dreams; dreams of water filling the world, pouring from every crack and crevice; of trying to run, only postponing the inevitable; of the people who rose up out of the water and turned to look at me, to chase me; of being pulled down into the deep, turbulent green water; of being drowned; of being killed.

I told myself that this wasn't a dream - that those things couldn't hurt me in real life. What a strange thing, to be so afraid of fear itself that you try to tell yourself *this is real.* I tried to control my breathing, but the thick smell of mold kept each breath shallow.

"Hey. You with me?" asked Ryan. I locked my wide eyes onto his inquisitive ones. Somehow, they brought me back again. I think it was the humanity, the connection that told me that I wasn't alone.

"Panic attack. Sorry... I-" I wanted to explain why. To tell him about the dreams and show that I had a good reason. I didn't. "I'm good."

"You sure? We could come back tomorrow."

"No. I need to know."

"Right. Can't be much more, this place isn't that big."

The water that covered about three inches of the floor of the basement was freezing. The cold pierced through my boots and socks, and crept up my legs. The sounds of our feet splashing bounced around the walls. On our right was a doorway; locked. I guess that's why I had brought the sledgehammer. With a deafening crack that echoed into the unexplored hall, the door was blasted open.

We walked into an office with a large walk-in file room in the rear. Nothing looked like it had been moved in 20 years. Urban explorers sometimes say that they feel a high as they cross the threshold into a forgotten place. I've heard some of them talk about the smell of those places being intoxicating.

They're right.

I walked into that room with a smile. To my left, on a waterlogged wooden desk was an electric typewriter, still plugged in. A stack of papers, rippled from the wet air, sat in the "out" box. The chair behind the desk was pushed back like the person had just gotten up and walked out of the room five minutes ago. In the filing room stood three large cabinets. Surely something was there. A name, a record, a clue to what had happened.

Ryan cracked the first cabinet with his crowbar. The old, thin metal gave easily. I pulled the first drawer out, eagerly looking inside. Empty. Not even the dividers were left. The second cabinet was the same way. We thought that the third was too, until we came to the bottom drawer. A pile of papers were sprawled crookedly, half-submerged in the murky water.

They looked like reports of some kind, like you might write for a college class. The cover sheets all said "Case study number: ######" in bold writing, and below that, "Philippe R. Menser, M.D." the insides were too detailed or too damaged to try to give a proper summary; in the first one, I thought that it might have been a trial for a new medication. Several were listed in the early paragraphs, but the latter pages mentioned nothing about them. Instead, they gave a long, detailed description of the mental state of the "subject," their habits, dietary preferences, etc. In all, there were about a dozen case studies, each containing 50 - 100 pages.

Ryan and I were looking through the papers spread across the desk by the light of our flashlights, trying to get a sense of what we'd found. Something in the hall caught his eye. His head snapped up and he glared intently at the water. His whole body tensed, then I saw it too.

The water in the hall was rippling. Something had just moved past us into the darkness.

 EDIT: For you visual people, I drew up a [model](http://imgur.com/a/FDpQE) of the first floor.

The hospital grounds sat in the middle of the town like a bullseye. This was most likely a coincidence; the oldest parts of the town were closest to the river that formed the southern boundary and over time, the town had expanded North and East. The newest building, and the furthest North, was a medium-sized retail store that the town had fought to boycott. Towns that grow over a long period of time are devoid of any master plan, since people just add what they need when they need it. In this case, the evidence all over town could be found in the large expanses of forest and sand dunes that were left between one developed area of town and the next. If a place had been too costly to build on, it was skipped over.

After the "old" hospital, which it was still referred to, was closed in 1990, the small patches of forest around it took back the grounds in only a matter of months. The building itself fell to a different sort of wilderness. Being out of view from the street below, daring high-schoolers and vagrant meth addicts moved in. in only a few days, every one of the windows had been broken out. In a couple weeks, some had tried to burn it down. After more than 20 years, it looked like the place was about to fall down.

"The police don't really come up here any more," explained Ryan. "They just kind of drive through the parking lot and check to see if the place is still standing. If it isn't on fire or there isn't a car parked in the lot, they don't even check inside." From the passenger seat in Ryan's car, it was easy enough to see why it didn't require security to keep people out. Yellow caution tape was off-putting. The collapsed ceiling and dark, metal-screened windows were threatening. The place looked downright dangerous.

"Why doesn't someone just tear it down?" I wondered aloud.

"Well, are we going to do this?" Ryan killed the headlights, casting the building in blue light from the one streetlamp over the gravel parking area. I took a sledge from the trunk I'd borrowed from Nicole's house. Ryan had brought a crowbar as well, but just in case we found anything serious in there, Ryan had brought his pistol. Guns usually make me nervous, but I counted having an armed, off-duty cop with me as a good thing.

"Now, that - " Ryan said, pointing to the chained set of double doors just to the right of a sign saying [Town] Medical Clinic, "- is the main entrance. There's no key anymore, but people have found other ways to get in." He took us around the left side of the building where we found a door propped crookedly in its frame. The nails of its hinges had pulled out of the soft, moldy wood. Once we were inside, we turned our our flashlights on and got our first look at the inside. Something about being in that place was really unsettling. Thick patches of green moss had grown over the floor and walls near the windows and  doors. Beneath the holes in the ceiling, huge ferns grew out of the dark, wet carpet. Under everything was a slimy layer of green mold. It smelled like a forest. A large beam had fallen from the ceiling across the room like a downed tree trunk, adding to the clutter and claustrophobia of the small room.

Have you ever seen the footage of scuba divers or those robotic submarines who sift through old shipwrecks and underwater buildings? That's what it reminded me of. Everything had something growing on it, and there was dust hanging in the air, unmoving. It was the silence that really drew the similarity; it was thick and oppressive, as if there were a thick, weighted blanket over everything.

That first room looked like a break room, or staff area. Against the left wall was a small kitchenette area, with cabinets along the floor and ceiling and a sink set into the counter top. Across from the door we'd just come through was a gaping black hole that had once been a doorway. Some long-ago fire had rounded its edges, leaving an oblong black portal. To the right, was a staff bathroom area, which had a couple of lockers, a shower and a toilet. We had to be careful walking across the floor. Shards of glass from the broken window and mirror in the bathroom were scattered across the carpet. Near the doorway, the fire had eaten through the floor, exposing the supports.

The next room was bigger, looking like it might have been a place to gather everyone at the hospital together at once. It had the most evidence that people had been living in it. Bottles, beer cans and black trash bags were in every corner and across the floor. A sleeping bag lay crumpled under the black, grated window against the far wall. Metal folding chairs were scattered about, casting long black shadows along the ground as Ryan and I shined our lights.

Through a larger door on the right-hand side of that room was a long hallway. This was the main leg of the hospital which consisted of five separate rooms with tattered, white curtains hanging in the doorways. I couldn't see all the way to the end of the hall. It looked like it just kept going and going. The wall on our left, opposite of the rooms, was made almost entirely out of metal-caged windows that looked out onto a small porch. During the daytime, you could have seen the trees and bushes beyond.

It was here that I began to have the feeling of being watched. The metal crosshatch pattern over the windows and abysmal blackness beyond made it impossible to see out. I imagined it was something like a one-way mirror. If someone had been standing outside, they could have been watching us like gerbils in a cage.

Ryan and I checked the first hospital room on our right. Everything had been stripped and removed, even the cupboard doors and drawers. A tiny slit of a window on the back wall of each room let in light from the one bluish streetlamp that illuminated the parking area outside.

Ryan went inside, and I stayed watch. Watching for what, I don't know, but I ended up staring into the blackness at the far end of the hall. Maybe it was my imagination or my anxiety, but I thought I heard something down there, a soft shuffle in the dark. There was no echo; being inside that place was like being in a vacuum. I turned off my light, and just looked and listened. My fear grew, as I focused on anything at the end of the hall. It was so dark, I could see the phosphene swirls I normally only see when I close my eyes. It was silent, but I was sure that there was someone there, at the end of the hall. My heart rate rose, I could feel it in my tense shoulders. Was that a sound? A whisper?

I was shaken out of my concentration by Ryan's hand grabbing my arm. "You okay?" I hadn't seen his flashlight illuminate the hall way around me.

"Yeah..." I didn't know whether to tell him that I'd heard something or whether I'd been just been daydreaming. "Let's split up, I'll check the front door and see what's at the end of the hallway."

"Sure," Ryan said, going into the second room. As quietly as I could, listening as I went, I went to the far end of the hall. The reason we hadn't been able to see anything at the end was that there was a wall made of strips of flat black rubber hanging from the ceiling. I parted them and shined my light through. The smell of mold invaded my sinuses. Past the curtain, the linoleum floor turned into finished, smooth cement. The hallway dropped off in a downward slope, ending in a pool of standing water.

Before the curtain, alongside the patients rooms, was a moderately-sized reception area. Light streamed in from the parking lot through the locked front doors. On the left was a tall reception desk built into the floor and wall. Behind that was a computer desk and some rusted-out file cabinets. The metal cabinets had signs of being pried open long ago. As was to be expected, nothing interesting was left. Whatever papers had been left behind had probably been burned, leaving more charred areas on the floor.

I turned to leave, but something behind the computer desk flashed, catching my eye. Fallen in the area between the desk and the wall was a glass frame of some sort. Mold had grown inside the glass, and water had damaged the printer paper inside, but you could still make out the words "visiting" near the top, and "unwanted" near the bottom right corner. Nothing with a doctor's name on it.

I left the reception area, expecting Ryan to be nearly done checking the patient rooms. I didn't see any light.

"Ryan?" I called weakly, moving back down the hall. The feeling of being watched was overwhelming and the hairs on my neck stood straight up. Ryan didn't answer. In the second room I found him standing stock-still, facing the wall, his dark flashlight in his right hand. He was staring at a broken mirror above a tiny porcelain sink. "Hey. Find something?" I asked cautiously, staying outside the doorway.

He turned his whole head ninety degrees to look at me, taking a full second to respond He shook his head like he was shaking off a dream, "No." He seemed to have snapped out of whatever trance he'd been in. "Fuck this place, man." At that moment, I was so glad to have Ryan with me. Who knows how long he or I would have sat there, staring off into space without the other there to pull them back to reality.

"Yeah. You get the feeling like we're being watched from out there?" I asked, gesturing outside the large, glassless windows.

"Now that you mention it, yeah. Thanks for that." He said with a sly smile, joining me in the hallway. "Only one place left to go." He pointed his light at the rubber curtain.

It occurs to me now that there was one more room we didn't check. The fifth patients room. We hadn't found anything in the other four, and it seemed like there was a slim chance we'd have better luck with the fifth. At least, that's what we thought at the time. Maybe that was where we went wrong.

"No Pets Allowed"

That's what the sign had said in the rental office. I was pissed. Of course, on the quick tour of the apartment, I hadn't had time to find the dog food and collar that someone had left behind the stacking washer and dryer. Why a dog? Why couldn't it have been a cat? I'm not allergic to cats. I hadn't had any sneezing or itching eyes yet that first night, but I expected that the first time I vacuumed and stirred up all the dander that had settled under the carpets, I'd also be stirring up my own personal hell.

I thought about leaving, or getting a different apartment, but I knew realistically that there wasn't one. The nearby university had been growing faster than the housing market, and if I left now, with Spring term just a couple days away... I didn't even want to think about it. Not to mention the fact that I'd just spent all day moving my things in. No, I was staying.

Best to go back to the rental office, complain and hope for a carpet deep-cleaning. I picked up the dog food and collar and put them in a plastic bag. I tried to pick up as much hair as I could out of the corner as well. Tomorrow, I'd go there and let them have a piece of my mind.

---

3/24/2014

I ran into my neighbor as I was leaving the house. I'm in 150a, and he's in 150b. He had long hair and was standing outside smoking. Since I was carrying the bag, I held it up (in what might have been an accusatory way) and asked if the previous person who lived here had had a dog. He said that if she did, they kept it extremely well-hidden. He'd never heard anything. He looked like a pot smoker though, so I wonder if he would have even noticed.

The young girl at the front desk of the rental office said that she couldn't do anything about it until the owners got back at 4:00. I told her to have them call me. By 8:00, I had abandoned all hope of that happening.

Night #2 in the new place. I stayed up late (well, late for me) watching movies and putting off unpacking. At about 1:00 in the morning, I turned in for the night. My questions of how thick the walls were between 150a and 150b were quickly answered, as I heard a steady thump like music while I laid in bed. By 1:45, I was alternating between fed up and amazed. Who can listen to one techno song, loudly, for this long? At about 3:00 am I drifted off to sleep.

---

3/25/2014

"Shit. Literal, actual, *shit*, is all over my attic." The girl at the rental office was useless. It wasn't her fault that she couldn't do anything, but I didn't care.

That morning, I'd seen 150b outside, smoking again so I went to ask him about his music. I was pretty sure that he was lying when he said he wasn't even home last night, and hadn't had any music on "for sure." When I went back inside, I heard the steady rhythm again. Like a pissed off soccer mom, I power-walked over to his front door to try to catch him in the act, but when he opened the door... there was no music.

Mr. Helpful from 150b followed me back to my apartment in order to "help me find the music." He reeked like pot. *I knew it.* Back in the living room of 150a, the pulsing sound was louder than ever. 150b proudly announced that the sound was coming from the attic.

There must have been a raccoon or something in the attic, because when he came down, the thumping had stopped and he was holding something in his bare hand. "Something," in this case, was a hunk of feces, one of hundreds spread around the small attic in small piles.

---

3/26/2014

Last night, a noise outside my room woke me up at around 3:00 am. I rolled over and brushed it off until I heard something definitely moving around in my kitchen. Thinking that it was the raccoon from the attic, I threw open my bedroom door, charged into the kitchen and turned on the light, all while yelling. A horrible, piercing scream rang in my ears, and in front of me, scrambling back under the kitchen table was a terrified child wearing dark clothes. I screamed in shock and if my legs hadn't buckled, I'd have run straight out the back door.

I fell against the wall, and involuntarily sat on the boxes I'd left there. The screaming stopped, and I took in the fact that there was a long cable, the kind that people use to tie up their dogs outside, that was snaking like a tail across my kitchen floor. One end was frayed, but the other led up to a collar around the child's neck. Also on the floor, were the shattered remains of a ceramic bowl.

3/27/2014

When I came back to the rental office to pick up my refund check, I noticed that they had amended their sign in permanent marker: 

"*Only One Resident Per Unit* No Pets *or Children* Allowed." 









 This whole situation just hit a new level of weird and terrifying.

If you want to read about what's happened to me before, you can go [here](http://goo.gl/u84b4A).

I'm still having the dreams. Always with those fucking dreams - sinking, being closed in on, isolated and killed. Over and over. But really, the worst part about them is that for half of the time I'm dreaming, I can't even tell the difference between it and reality. I wake up, I do normal things, I move on with my day and then things take that awful turn.

Today, if I am dreaming, it just got so much worse, and I can't wake up. However, I think this was real.

I woke up (I work nights, so this was in the afternoon) and as I drove to work around 7:30 pm I saw the old man who broke into my house a few weeks ago. He was standing, dripping wet, wearing the same clothes as that day that he came into my house. Standing under the overpass behind a short, chain link fence, I could see his one good eye tracking my car. I nearly rear-ended the car in front of me because of while I watched him.

But again, that's how my dreams start. Everything's normal and then some part of reality shatters like glass and that's the first sign that something is wrong. Then it breaks more and more and by the end...

But this wasn't a dream. Maybe if I say that enough, even *I'll* believe it.

I went to work, which has been its own mess, and zombie-stumbled my way through again. I only vaguely remember my boss telling me about how I've been acting different, that he's worried about my performance. It just doesn't seem worth concentrating on, especially with my mind on the fact that the old man was back. What was he doing there?

I drove back home, arriving at about 4:30. Early morning is about the only time I enjoy it here. It's cool and calm, unlike the rest of the day. As much as I thought I wouldn't, I miss the hell out of Oregon.

This is what I was thinking when I walked up to the front door, and with key in hand, in the brief light of a passing car, I saw him through the window. He was standing, crouched on the dark stairs. I could just see his feet and torn pants, and the bottom of his old rain jacket as he sat about eye-level on the stairs above me.

At first, I didn't react other than backing away from the door. I was so shocked at what I'd seen that I couldn't even form a plan of what I wanted to do. Then I ran. It wasn't the reasonable thing to do - I should have called the police again, but with the last two times that they've come ending with my own interrogation and nothing good coming from it, I subconsciously decided against going down that road again.

So I ran. About a minute after starting, I think I forgot why I was running and just... blacked out. I guess it was sort of like being in a daydream, except there was no dream. It was actually nice.

I found myself in a small park at the end of a dead-end residential street, just as the sun was beginning to come up.  I sat on the swings while I caught my breath and called the police. The dispatcher said that they'd send someone, but that my address had a note against it in their system and that I should meet them in the parking lot that I share with the other houses in the area.

I agreed and started jogging back. How had I run this far in slacks and dress shoes?

On my right, I could see the road that I'd driven this morning, the various overpasses, exits and signs filling with red taillights of people going to work. I was really close to where I had seen the man this morning. Close enough that I could take a minute and see if anything was there, I reasoned.

I left the sidewalk and followed a dry, dusty path beneath the overpass. There were a surprising number of footprints and trash all around. People had obviously been living there. Were living there. I thought, a little further back there might have been a sleeping bag in the corner where the cement pillar met the ground. At the bottom of the hill was a small... I can't call it a pond, but it was standing water, and all around the edge where it had receded in the recent heat was trash and various debris. Everything you might expect to find except, floating near the edge was a wooden oar. I remember thinking, *what the fuck is that doing there?*

My minute was up; I turned to go, but silhouetted against the rising sun was a profoundly greasy-looking man in an old rain coat.

He moved with startling speed, having the upper ground and the element of surprise. I tried to run, but in the soft sand, I managed to take only a couple of steps before he was upon me. I crouched, bringing my center of gravity down, and then exploded my body upwards into his. The stink of alcohol, body odor, and garbage was overpowering, and he was still very wet. He fell down the hill, crashing down onto the edge of the not-pond.

Unfazed, he got up, grabbing the oar with both hands. Again I tried to run, but he was faster. He brought the oar down on the top of my head with a low, fleshy crack. Things went dark. I could feel myself being picked up and dragged, and I thought I could hear a little girl screaming...

I felt my body lifted up high into the air, and cleared up enough to make out the man screaming "... be baptized and ye shall be free!"

I was in the water again, disoriented and now unable to breathe. I opened my eyes, but the only thing I could see was the man's face and arm, under the water holding me by the throat, bringing me down further into the water. I reached for the bottom, anything to get a grip and push off of. *How is it so deep?*

The water started to froth and bubble around us, and soon I couldn't even see his face. I kicked wildly, and finally connected with something. He let go, and I was free-swimming in the deep water. I figured out which way was up by following the bubbles, and after another few seconds, broke the surface. The air felt cool on my fiery lungs.

I wasn't in the not-pond anymore. I was in the middle of a large lake, near a dark green fiberglass rowboat. I scrambled up onto it in my panic. Where was the man? Where was I? What the fuck just happened?

I sat in the boat, curled into a ball, just breathing for several minutes. I hadn't heard a thing break the silence on the lake around me. I peered over the edge and saw the man, floating face-down in the lake, a dozen feet from the rowboat. I took the paddle and set off toward land.

After a few paddles, I realized that this was the lake that I'd been thrown into before. I was back in Oregon - back in my hometown, even. I paddled up to the bank, toward the only house I still knew in the area, Nicole's.

After spending the day in police custody, they finally released me back to Nicole's where I'm writing this now. As I said, things have drastically escalated, and this is far from over.

I can't go back home. I'm here. And despite feeling like I've fallen into my own Twilight Zone episode, there's also a feeling of being back home... So now I'm going to get to the bottom of this thing. Nicole has agreed let me stay, so long as I try to keep her out of whatever is going on.

Tomorrow, I take my first step toward solving this. Wish me luck. 









 I haven't gotten any comments and don't have any IRL people to show it to. Read a sentence or the whole thing and let me know what you think! This is the longest thing I've written and I'm at the point where I'm not sure if it's worth going on, or if there's something I could be doing better. Seriously, tell me how much it sucks. Tell me how bad blogger is. Just tell me if you *didn't* read it, at least that's something!

Thanks in advance.

 Hi everyone. I'm starting to get into writing as a hobby, and right now I'm working on a series for /r/nosleep. I'm not getting a lot of feedback there, though. So... 

Thoughts? Questions? Smart remarks?

Leave your constructive criticism in the comments [here](http://atomgrayhome.blogspot.com/). 




 I'm back home.

"Home."

What is home?

Is home where you go at the end of the day? The place where you park your car? Where you sleep? Because if so, then yes. I'm home now.

But maybe home is where you come from; where you were born and grew up. The place that formed you into the person you eventually became.

Maybe it's the place where you feel like you belong. That part of the world that continues to shape as well as reflect you. Like when you tune a guitar and you can hear the dissonant vibrations getting smaller and smaller until the sounds become indistinguishable from each other. A place that resonates with a person. That sounds like home to me.

In any case, I'm back from my trip to Oregon, my hometown, and the nightmare going on there. You can read about that here:

[1](http://goo.gl/mUbcoc),    [2](http://goo.gl/3jXhS8),    [3](http://goo.gl/Omv2sC),   [4](http://goo.gl/51dlgg)

I've had a really hard time dealing with everything over the past week. I haven't slept. I go back and forth between wanting to figure out what's happening there and getting frustrated when I can't find anything new. I should probably just consider myself lucky to have gotten away alive. I wish that I could just forget the past and move on.

But growing up in that town has rubbed off like a stain on my mind. Going back and *dying* there... 

For starters, I see my sister now. That sentence looks insane sitting on the page. I feel insane. But I'm too tired and too scared to deny that it's true. I see her nearly every day. Sometimes, especially after more than a few drinks, we'll even talk. What's weird is that her presence seems normal now. What could be normal about seeing your dead sister's ghost walking around in your house? Though, I'm not even sure that she is a ghost. I think there's a chance that she's always been there, but I just couldn't see her.

I wish I could ask her what's going on. I wish I could ask her for help in closing whatever I opened by going back to that town. But I can't, because aside from being dead, she's just a normal four-year-old who doesn't know much.

"Marissa, where does your daddy work?"

"He makes the Monster 'Messanin' at the fac-tor-y. He makes the Monster Messanin!"

"What's Monster Medicine?"

"Um. It's a messanin."

"Do you take Monster Medicine?"

"Yes."

"Why?"

"'Cause I go to sleep, and I eat the messanin!" she says, jumping on my bed.

[Newport Pharmaceuticals](http://goo.gl/5MeEOf) is still around, by the way. Please don't bother them. I wrote them an email through their website to ask if they'd ever owned a factory or laboratory in Oregon near my town, and I got a response a couple days later saying that they had no records of it. The company has primarily moved to Europe though, and no longer operates near Newport Beach, California or Newport, Oregon (which, to clarify, is not the town I'm from though neither are far away). 

So that's a dead end. Again. I'm not sure where to go from here. 

I don't know what else to ask her, though. Like I said, most of the time she's mute. Sometimes she's here and other times she seems to disappear. Most of the time, she's sad, and I've heard her crying at night. Physically, she seems normal, except for a long scar on her head where her hair doesn't grow. It looks like I'd imagine a brain surgery scar would look like, but I'm not sure. I can touch her, but she draws away, like the contact causes her discomfort.

Two nights ago, I got back from work after dark, exhausted. I re-heated some pizza and shakily poured myself a drink, sat down and flipped through the pages of Reddit. My eyes were already heavy, and after nodding off on the couch a few times, I got up and started to clean the kitchen before going to bed.

Marissa had shown up, and I could see her pacing in the hall to my left as I faced the sink. I had turned the garbage disposal on and was spraying out the egg shells and coffee grounds from the morning down the drain when I noticed that she had stopped moving.

I finished spraying out the sink and loading the dishwasher, then looked up at her, which made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. She was backed into the corner where the floor meets the wall, with one finger pointed straight out at something behind me.

I slowly turned and like a nightmare you wish you could wake up from, saw a man in shabby clothes standing in the doorway to the living room not six feet away from me. I have no idea how long he was there watching me. He was wet, his long hair and beard were scraggly and matted, with streaks of gray.  I froze again, not sure what to do or which way to run.

Then he flashed a smile, as if he'd been waiting to be acknowledged. I noticed that one of his eyes was pure, milky white. He anxiously pawed at his neck like someone satiating a nervous tic. "You're not supposed to be here," he said, his face sinking into a confused frown.

"Okay, whoah, if you're here to rob me... I don't have much. Take what you want and just go."

"Rob you?" he asked slowly, as if processing each word separately. "No. No, no, no, no." With each word, his eyes traced some invisible thing moving back and forth across the floor. His hand shot up to his neck again. "It's already mine. You're dead." The man backed up through the door into the dark living room and disappeared from view around the corner.

I left through the front door. On my way out, I heard him yell from the living room, "Jesus continued: There was a man who had two sons!" before I shut the door. I called the police from my cell phone, telling them what had happened. When they came to the house and searched it, they didn't find anyone, though the sliding door in the living room was left open.

Then the smelled the alcohol on my breath and began to question me. You could see the exact moment that each officer lost faith in what I'd told them.

"So tell us again what he looked like, sir."

"Like I said, he had gray hair and a beard. Maybe 40's or 50's? About the same height as me, and he had a dark raincoat on."

"A raincoat? What color was it?"

"I couldn't tell, it was all wet."

"It was wet? Is there a river or a lake around here?"

"Um... No. It was probably wet from the rain. Like he walked in from outside."

"Sir, it doesn't look like it's rained for a week here..."

They left pretty soon after that. Finally after triple-checking that I'd locked all the doors and windows, and as many drinks to calm my nerves, I laid in bed. The door opened and Marissa came in, crawling up onto the foot of my bed.

"Who was that?" she asked.

"I dunno. Some tweaker."

She laughed. "Like Tweety Bird?"

"Yeah, if Tweety Bird was a drug addict."

"Oh," she said very seriously, with feigned understanding.

God, I'm so tired. I wonder if this even makes sense anymore. 

What if I really did imagine the man? From the white eye to the wet rain jacket... two sons... What if I really am losing it? Or what's worse, what if this is all real? I just don't know anymore.

What do I do now, /r/nosleep? 









 I don't know where to start. If you haven't read the rest of this series, you may want to do that now, in order for this to make sense. If this even can make sense.

Last week my uncle, the last living relative I had in my hometown, died. With him gone, the police and other prominent members of the town had me followed away from town. They also took some pictures which had revealed after my mother's death that I had had a sister who died before I was born.

The police warned me not to get involved. They said it would be better if I got away while I still could. They said that the people who were at my uncle's house after his "suicide" were dangerous people. People capable of making someone, a child, disappear. 

In spite of that, I had to know. If I'm being really honest, what I wanted more than anything else was to finally put my past to rest. That's the real reason I came back to Oregon after my mother died. The feeling throughout my whole life that the town I'd grown up in was rotten, backwards and wrong.

After I was sure the police had stopped following me, I turned around and came back to my mother's house. I'd been staying there and doing research on the town. I'd started with some of the prominent members of the town and their families.

What I learned is that many of the older adults who "run" the town, from the fire and ambulance services, to the schools, construction, police, commerce, and even the mayor have something in common. They all have past records of being homeless. Almost every well-known person in town that I could think of had something like this. Suspiciously missing from this list was Pastor Charles, the massive man who operated the local church. This wouldn't necessarily mean anything, of course. However, it did seem strange that all these prominent people had come from around the country, and in fact the world, to this one small town and had all done extremely well here.

I began to shift my search to what might have drawn them here. In the 1960's through the 1980's, jobs had been as plentiful as the trees here. Then in the 1990's, those jobs had dried up.

I found a few old scans of newspaper articles from the 1990's (since none of the people who were still here were involved in the fishing or timber industries), but none of them showed any kind of attraction to this town in particular. Good schools, fast growth, but little else. So I went to the library, where they kept a near-complete collection of local newspapers and found a front-page article from 1985, which included a black-and-white picture of a ribbon-cutting ceremony in front of a huge pharmaceutical plant. A man in a black suit who I didn't recognize was holding the scissors in the age-old pose, but it was the people behind him that shocked me. There they stood, half of the people I felt were responsible for whatever was wrong with this town. And my father in a white lab coat.

I went to print the page article and got an error message about paying a fee to the librarian. Stupidly, I went to the front desk. As I approached, the girl working there did a double take, and then slowly got up and walked to the back room.

It was time to leave.

I got in my car and scribbled down what I could remember from the article. "Newport Pharmaceuticals Plant Opens Doors." "55 new jobs." "November 13, 1985."

I'd never heard of any kind of plant near here or "Newport Pharmaceuticals." As far as I'd known, my father had moved here shortly after he was born, and the whole time I'd been growing up, he'd never had a job for longer than a year.

I headed back to my mother's house to see what I could find on the internet. I hid the car as before and walked up to the front. I was walking up the driveway when I saw the neighbor sitting on the front porch. She'd seen me, so I couldn't get away, though she was smiling as if she was happy to see me.

She said she was locked out of her house, and came to see if my mother had a spare key. She must have been going absolutely senile, because she didn't even seem to realize that she hadn't seen me since I was 18. In fact, the last time I'd seen her was after one of my mother's fits when she'd kicked me out of the house. I'd ended up going next door and having dinner. Even though I'd had to sit through an hour of her and her husband tell me about how it wasn't that bad and that I should forgive my mother, the food had at least been good.

I told her that my mother was dead, and she looked so sad. "Oh no. Oh, you poor thing," she said, coming closer with her arms outstretched. I half-heartedly returned the tiny woman's hug, eager to get inside where I wouldn't be seen, when I thought I felt an insect sting me on my ribs.

I went to brush it away, but didn't feel anything remaining on the spot where I'd felt the bite. Then I realized that the old woman was smiling widely again. I started to feel dizzy, and tried to escape back to my car, but before I could even make it off the porch, I was unable to walk. Suddenly, several people came from inside the house and carried me into a car.

They drove me to the lake, and loaded me into a small boat. Two older men, one who owned a furniture store in town, and the other who I'd seen before, but didn't know his name, took me in the boat to the deep center of the lake.

[I don't swim.](http://goo.gl/Rk6nmc) I haven't been able to get over my fear of open water since I was 12 years old, when I saw something terrible lurking deep under this same lake. It was dark now, the only lights were the colored running lights. I fought to move, to fight, to get away, to scream. Anything. I couldn't move. I could barely breathe, my chest felt like it was being crushed. The two men were waiting for something that I couldn't see, and after what felt like an hour, I finally gave up. I felt cold, and tears streamed down my face as I lay in the bottom of the fishing boat.

One of the men broke the silence, "There. Let's do it."

One grabbed my arms as the other grabbed my ankles, and with a grunt, they heaved my body like a bag of cement over the side of the boat.

I know that I drowned. I felt every second of it, clearly as I am sitting here typing this out. The fear forced the precious air out of my lungs and I sank, serene and peaceful, down into the black.

Inside my mind, a primal panic broke loose again, creating chaos but my body remained motionless. The last thing I remember was the intense pressure, and the sensation of losing consciousness.

Then, impossibly, I woke up. It was almost like going through a door, on the one side was one world, the world you feel when you're awake, the "real world." And then on the other side, I woke up into a completely different world, in a different place. I wasn't in the lake any more. I stood up in the middle of an empty house I'd never seen before. There was enough light to see around myself, but it didn't seem to be coming from anywhere, like maybe I was glowing.

I walked from the living room into the dining area, which had a large table and was set for seven. I heard a sound, like a child giggling and small footfalls coming from the doorway on the other side of the room.

"Hello?" I tried to shout loudly, but no sound came out. I ran through the doorway into the kitchen, and heard more footsteps sounding like they were going upstairs. I ran after the sound and came to the top of the steps. The door on my right was open slightly, and I could hear a child laughing and talking on the other side. I pushed it open slowly, and there sat my sister who I'd never known, playing with a pair of knitted dolls. She like she was about four years old, just like she'd looked in the pictures I'd seen of her.

She looked up at me as I walked in with a big, sweet smile and then held out one of the dolls for me to take. Jesus Christ, I got down on the floor in that dark, otherworldly house and played dolls with my dead sister.

Then the sound of a door opening and closing came from the bottom of the stairs. My sister looked sad. "You have to go," she said. "I hope you come back. I don't like it here. He's not nice."

I tried to ask her *who?* but still no sound came out. Heavy steps were coming steadily but slowly up the stairs.

The bedroom door opened, but all I could see on the other side was blackness, then a huge, bone-white hand shot out of the darkness, grabbed my whole head and pulled me through the door. I woke up in the lake again, able to hear something crashing through the brush on the banks. I dragged myself onto the shore, and heard a woman's shrill voice yelling "Oh thank God, you're alive. Are you okay?"

The woman's name is Nicole. She took me out of the lake and to her small house in the woods near the lake. I'm alive, and feeling better now, thanks to her. I don't know what to think anymore. Tomorrow, I'm leaving the state and going back to my old life. I think it's clear that what's going on here is beyond me. If any of you have any idea of what's going on here... please, help me.

I should never have come back home.

EDIT: Linked the story of why I don't swim in that paragraph.

[Update](http://goo.gl/tzrLPP) 




 When I was young, my friends and I would play hide-and-seek in the woods near our houses. The "woods" were actually an overgrown, undeveloped lot surrounded on all sides by residential or commercial areas. 

Let me tell you, I was the *KING* of hide-and-seek. I hid in the same spot every day, but no one ever found me. See, most people thought that the woods had always been overgrown, but one day I crawled on my stomach to under a thick patch of brush and cam face-to-face with a tombstone.

[Update 1](http://goo.gl/3jXhS8)

This morning when I finally reached town, I noticed a squad car tailing me. It followed me all the way up to my uncle's house on the southern edge of town. The police officer never turned their lights on or anything, but it wasn't exactly trying to be subtle.

I parked in the driveway, and stayed in the car. The squad car parked behind me. Two overweight officers got out and slowly walked over to flank my rental car. "Good afternoon!" said the officer on my left. His voice was young, causing me to do a double take.

"Ryan?" I said.

"Hey Adam." He said sheepishly. Ryan and I had been in the same class in school. We weren't close friends, but when you've known someone through 12 years of school and grew up in the same small town, you get to know them.  "Listen, Adam. I'm afraid I've got some bad news."

My uncle is dead.

Ryan and the other officer who I didn't know both tried to stop me from going into the house. They said it was suicide. He hanged himself in his bedroom. I told them that all my belongings were inside the house, and firmly told them to let go of me.

Ryan told the other officer to wait while he escorted me inside. In the living room, there were several people, a few who I could recognize. The pastor of the local church, the old lawyer, and a few other people I knew from around town.

As soon as he saw me, the pastor came over to me and Ryan purposefully. "Adam. You really shouldn't be here right now," he said.

Just looking at him, made something rise up inside me. Learning about Marissa yesterday, and having this hostile greeting today... The fact that all these people had suspiciously shown up here at my uncle's house, and now I wasn't allowed. I opened my mouth to tell them all to get the fuck out, but thought better of it. I didn't need to get off on the wrong foot with all these people at once. "I'll just grab a couple things and go," I said, and walked purposely toward the second bedroom that I'd been staying in.

Behind me, I could hear the pastor whispering harshly to Ryan.

Once in the room, I shut the door. Quickly, I threw my few clothes and belongings into my backpack. Clearing the small desk, I noticed the plain envelope that had contained the pictures from the night before. It was empty.

I searched around on the floor and under the bed when I heard someone open the door. It was Ryan. "All right, Adam," he said, "you ready?"

I looked at him, taking in his expression, and sizing him up. Who the fuck could I trust anymore? "Something is missing," I said flatly.

"Sorry about that. You could try asking the people out there if they've seen it. But..." He stepped inside and closed the door behind him. "Adam, they want you *gone*. I'm not charging you with anything, but they're starting to whisper that you had something to do with your uncle's..."

"What?"

"Hey I'm not accusing you of anything, like I said. But I think you should get out of here. Now. Leave town and don't come back. These are people you don't want to get mixed up with. Dangerous people." His face was deathly serious as he said these last words.

Someone knocked on the door and started trying to push Ryan out of the way.

Pastor Charles was a huge man. He must have been about 60 years old now, but I can still remember him closer to his prime playing sports with my father when I was much younger. It was as if every aspect of himself was hand-picked to make him physically imposing. He stood at 6'6" and wrapped in muscle. His customary black suit was fit him like he'd been poured into it. As a kid, what had scared me the most about him had been his left eye, which was pure milky white and completely blind. He pushed his way into the room, and reached to grab my arm. 

"It's time for you to leave, child" he said, staring at me intensely at me with his one good eye.

I told him to get off of me and stormed out through the living room. The people there had all joined hands, with one opening presumably left for the Pastor.

Ryan's squad car followed me a few miles outside of town before turning back. This whole thing has me really scared.

What was that? Is this how law enforcement usually handles a suicide?

Maybe this was stupid, but I went back to my mother's house. I took another road that skirted the edge of town so that any police that were posted on the highways wouldn't see me. I drove by once to check that no one was there, but with my deep tire tracks and disturbed gravel still there from when I left, I was fairly certain that no one had been there since that night.

I hid the car on a side street and walked back. In the afternoon sun, the house didn't seem as menacing. I opened the front door and quickly slipped inside before anyone could drive by. The carpet in the living room was still dark and smelled strongly of mildew from the spill, the TV screen was still broken and gaping. Everything looked just like I'd left it. I shivered as I looked at the spot on the couch where I last thought I'd seen my mother.

Maybe I'm crazy, and maybe this won't help. This might even be a really bad idea, but I just need somewhere to think. I've been feeling like there's some kind of purpose for my coming back to Oregon. Like something drawing me here. Maybe it's Marissa, or maybe it's my mother. Either way, I'm not taking any action just yet. I'm going to spend a few more days here to see what else I can learn about my sister and my uncle's death.

I can't just run away from this. Not yet.

EDIT: Sorry I can't update any of you now. Since I got here, I've been feeling sicker and sicker. I slept feverishly all night and day today. Feeling too weak to even do anything else. When I'm back on my feet, I'll clue you all in on what I've turned up in my search of the town's history. Unfortunately it's not good news.

 [Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1xlpn8/come_back_home/)

Sorry for not updating you sooner. As some of you know, I recently came back home to the Oregon Coast because of my mother's death.

Last Thursday I went to her funeral. The service itself was somber and... respectful. My mother had made very few friends in her life. Not that her family had ever mistook her for a friend.

The next day, we got a call from the elderly lawyer who was handling her estate. As I said, apparently I was named for something in her will, even though she had said I would get nothing. That afternoon we met with him in his small office.

"Thanks, gentlemen, for coming in today. I called you in to discuss the last will and testament of the deceased Rachel Smith. Henceforth referred to as 'the deceased.'" What followed was a listing and rather boring conversation about the things that my mother had owned. I sat awkwardly, feeling out of place wearing torn jeans and hoodie in the lawyer's clean, new office. Even worse, was the nagging thought that had my mother not hated me, I might have been the one having this discussion right now instead of my uncle.

"Finally, Mr. Gray." The lawyer said, continuing his drone.

"The deceased has specified that you are to have this." The lawyer pulled a plain, white envelope from his folder and placed it face-down on the table in front of me. "This concludes today's business." He read off of his notes, showing an expression of surprise that it had ended so abruptly, checking the back of the page, as though he had expected to go on quite a bit longer. Then he looked intently at the envelope and at me, then to my uncle. I could be wrong, but I thought he looked nervous at whatever was in the envelope.

Since I wasn't sure what was going to be inside, I stuffed it into my wallet without looking at it. If it was a message from my mother, I didn't need to be getting emotional here, in front of anyone and everyone.

I fell asleep in my uncle's truck on the way back and had a vivid dream. It's a dream I'd had before, when I was young. It starts out with a faceless marionette in one of those little curtained booths. The puppet looks like it's trying to talk to me, only I can't hear, like I'm deaf. It looks over it's shoulder and turns to me like it's pleading, but I can't help it. Then my mother's face lowers from behind the curtain on the top, with a huge smile.

I woke up as my uncle pulled into his driveway.

I waited to open the envelope until after midnight when my uncle went to bed. Inside were four faded pictures of a girl I'd never seen. She looked to be about four years old. The first two pictures were of her walking outside. The third was of the little girl on a stage of some sort. The last picture made my hair stand on end though, because it was the little girl being held by my smiling mother and father inside the first house I ever lived in.

I flipped back to the previous picture, and recognized the stage as being from the church that my father had taken me to as a child. In the background, you could just make out other children standing in a row, their parents behind them.

I focused on her face, her blond hair and blue eyes. She looked so much like my mother. Like me. 

In my head, I heard the small voice that had whispered in my ear my first night back home.

"Unwanted."

In the corner of my eye, I saw something move in the shadows. I jumped off the couch and turned to face it. My uncle was standing there frozen.

"Adam." He said. I could tell in his eyes and tone of voice that he knew what I'd seen.

"Who is that?" I asked, the fear and hurt tightening the muscles in my throat.

"Adam, I'm so sorry. Adam, I want you to know... I thought they should have told you. I tried to tell your mom. She wouldn't listen to me though."

"Who *is* she?" I asked again, louder as I held out the pictures.

"Her name was Marissa. She's your sister."

"What?"

"She died before you were born. Your mother... She threatened everyone so that they wouldn't tell you. She tried to act like it never happened, that Marissa had never been alive."

Hot tears stung my face now. I'd known my mother had been crazy, but to have had a *sister*, and to have had the whole town cover it up. I looked at my uncle, ready to scream at him, but then I saw that he had tears in his eyes too. His expression was so guilty. So sad. You could tell that he thought he deserved whatever I could do.

I deflated, sitting back down on the couch and dropping the pictures onto the ground. He came and sat next to me, and wrapped his arms around me.

Today I drove to see her grave.

Marissa Gray
1984-1988

The grave site was almost two hours away from the the town we lived in, the graveyard where we'd buried my mother three days ago. It was inside one of the largest graveyards in the county. A simple granite plaque, just one among hundreds. It took me most of an hour to find hers.

I stayed for a while, just staring, wondering what my life would have been like had she not died - wondering whether I would have even been born. I put off getting back in my car. The truth was out now, and eventually I'd have to go back, knowing that everyone in my small hometown had been carrying a secret - keeping it from me. A thousand little uncomfortable silences and awkward stares started to make sense. 

A dark cloud moved in front of the low sun and shot a chill down my spine. You know that feeling of being watched, even though you *know* no one is around?

With that, I figured it was time to leave, and briskly made my way to my car. As soon as I turned the key in the ignition, heavy rain started to pour down.

*Oregon*, I thought to myself.

On my way back West, the rain got worse as the sun dropped behind the hills ahead of me. One thing about this area, is that it's full of back-roads. One wrong turn and you could end up 40 miles in the wrong direction. Even though I'd driven this road dozens of times, before long everything started to look unfamiliar.

Wherever there weren't trees overhead, I had to slow down to a crawl just to see the road through all the rain. I came around a turn and out of nowhere, I saw something huge in the middle of the road. I slammed on my brakes and turned the wheel, and skidded off into the gravel shoulder. Behind me, in the middle of the road I could just make out a pair of traffic barriers.

I heaved a sigh of relief that I hadn't crashed and reversed out of the ditch. My headlights illuminated a wooden sign on the side of the road that just said, "Welcome to," which stuck me as being really unusual.

I stopped at a bed   breakfast not far up the road from there to ask for directions, but the owner kept smiling and seemed so happy to see me (and was so bad with directions) that I decided to stay the night here instead.

At least they have free Wi-Fi.

Tomorrow I'll go back and try to find out more about Marissa. I don't think this is done yet, /r/nosleep. How does a person convince a whole *town* to not tell them about their family? About the people they grew up with?

I tried calling my uncle, but he didn't answer. I think I'll try to get some sleep and head back in the morning.

EDIT: Left the B B early... The whole place smells like no one's actually stayed there since the 90's. Also, I didn't really feel like eating breakfast with the overly excited caretaker and his I'm-going-to-steal-your-kidneys smile.

I ended up having to take the long way, since the closed road to the south actually leads to the highway. Weird thing is that when I was almost to Veneta, the road was closed on the East side too. Like all of Veneta's been closed off. GPS is jumping to random locations, so I'm going to have to try to find a way around on my own.

Before the sun came up, I kept thinking I was seeing kids on the side of the road, but as soon as I would look at them, they weren't there. I just stopped to write this update when I thought I saw a little girl behind me in my rear-view mirror. Creepy day today.

[They Tried to Kill Me](http://goo.gl/luAfwb)

[Update](http://goo.gl/tzrLPP) 




 My mother is dead.

Dead people can't hurt you.

I keep telling myself this.

Yesterday, I arrived back in my home state of Oregon. Early this morning I drove from Portland back to my hometown. 

I'm from a small town - one of the many fishing and logging towns on the gray coast. Towns that grew like ripe fruit, healthy and strong from the surplus of jobs and profits reaped from the beautiful surroundings. Eventually, when the fish were hunted to the brink of extinction and the logging industry was cut down at its base by new legislation, those towns rotted.  Everything was still there, from the schools, roads and businesses to the people who'd flocked there for a good job and the chance to raise a family. Only now, with the money and main industries gone, all those things shriveled, dead on the vine.

When I was ten, my parents divorced. I spent half my time with each parent, trading off every week. I basically had two houses, but I never stayed in one place long enough to feel like I had a "home." Neither parent was meant to have a child, and this was apparent in their treatment of me. After their divorce, each parent made their best attempt at pretending that nothing had ever happened.

My father was in-and-out of work constantly, and never held any one job long enough to settle down. Eventually, I think he just couldn't take it, and after school one Friday when he was supposed to pick me up, he wasn't there. I never saw him after that.

I spent the rest of my time there with my mother, who hated the responsibility of having me there. Unlike my father, she had a job and could afford to buy a small manufactured home near the lake that she loved. That house was her baby, set up just the way she'd always planned it. I wasn't part of that plan.

I slept in the "guest bedroom" and kept my clothes in a suitcase. I wasn't allowed to listen to music that could be heard outside the room or watch movies after dark. She had always been adamantly against having cable.  Things in the house had to be set back to exactly where they belonged as if I'd never touched them. On multiple occasions, when she'd had friends over, I'd been locked in my room told to never make a noise, or sent outside to the garden shed without lights or power so that her friends wouldn't have to "put up" with me.

As soon as I turned eighteen, I got the fuck out of there and never looked back.

Then last week, I found out that she'd died.

That's why I'm back. My uncle was the one who wrote to let me know. He encouraged me to come to the funeral and, he said, to collect something that was in her will. I still don't know what it is. She made it clear to me more than once that I wasn't going to get anything when she "keeled over."

The funeral isn't until next week, but I felt compelled to stay in my hometown for a while. For a long time it felt like I'd never be welcome back. It's weird, seeing how little the town has changed. All the same little shops and stores are in all the same places. At the grocery store, I saw a few people that I went to school with. Things here seem like they haven't changed at all, they've just gotten older.

My uncle owns my mother's house now. He hasn't decided if he'd rather sell it outright or rent it out as a summer home. He told me that I'm allowed to stay there as long as I'm in town. It kind of made me wonder why we weren't closer while I was living here.

After the sun went down, I drove out to her house for the first time since coming back. The feeling of driving was so strange after being gone for so long. I felt like I still remembered every corner and sign and bump in the road from before I'd left, like I'd only been gone for a weekend instead of five years.

I got to the house and pulled into the gravel driveway. Headlights illuminated the prim garden, wooden privacy fence and the brick red and white house. I left immediately.

I was so filled with anger and sadness at being back in that place that I almost couldn't stand it. I drove to the nearest grocery store and bought two six-packs of beer and a bunch of junk food.

I drank one beer in the parking lot before driving back, and another in the driveway before getting out of the car. I opened the fence, averting my eyes from the tool shed and without questioning it, took the key from the hiding place on the porch and opened the door to go inside.

The house was exactly as I'd last left it. I knew it would be. Everything in its place. I put away my food in the empty fridge and pulled out my laptop. The internet was still up. I went into the guest room and set up up on the desk there. I almost closed the door... five years ago I would have had to, but I thought better of it and left it open. No one was left to upset now...

I spent a few hours alternating between Netflix and Reddit, finished the six-pack and ate half the junk food before I felt my eyes begin sagging. 

From the living room, I thought I heard the high-pitched whine that the tube TV made when it was turned on. A couple of seconds later, the hiss of static gradually met my ears. I could see the faint light from the TV shining down the hallway.

My heart was already pounding in my chest, but I had to go over and see what was going on. Trying not to make any noise, I got up and went into the hall. I could see the TV now, the screen a million bouncing points of light. I crept toward the living room, and right before I entered it, I saw her there. My mother. Sitting on the couch I could make out her shoulders and the back of her head.

The strength went out of my legs and my chest froze, unable to even pull in a breath. I couldn't look away. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, but no lack of belief would make it disappear. It seemed that reality itself was broken.

"No!" I tried to shout, but only a faint sound came out. The static on the television, the only source of light in the room, began to pulse in rhythm, as if the sound had fallen into it like a rock into a pond. Each ripple dropped the room into almost total darkness, and the sound of the static seemed to come from all around me.

I turned back, to try to escape down the hall, but the instant I looked back, all the doors slammed shut. I looked back to the living room and I saw my mother start to turn her head to look at me. The light from the TV faded to a single point, as if someone had turned it off. Then darkness. 

The sound increased to a deafening roar, like a waterfall. It increased until I thought my ear drums might rupture, then immediately, as if it had been muted, it stopped.

In that small moment of silence, a young female voice from the darkness right behind me whispered, "Unwanted."

The sound erupted forth again, and the lights that I'd left on earlier came back blindingly bright. The television exploded, and a  huge torrent of water burst forth into the middle of the living room, full of fish and lily pads and other leaves and debris.

I sprinted for the front door, slipping across the wet carpet, ran down the steps and into my car.

I'm writing this from my phone in a hotel room. I've got no idea what the fuck that was or what to do. All I know right now, is that I can't go back to that house.

I've got exactly one piece of comfort right now. And that is that my mother is dead.

Dead people can't hurt you.

I keep telling myself this.

[Update](http://goo.gl/tzrLPP) 




 I grew up in Oregon, right on the cold, dismal edge of the Pacific Ocean. Fifteen minutes in any direction would take you to a beach, an open expanse of sand dunes, a National or State park, or one of about a dozen permanent lakes. For years, every summer we'd go to a family friend's house to use their lakefront property and their dock. Looking back it doesn't seem like much, but I can remember spending countless hours there swimming, kayaking, paddle-boarding and snorkeling.

When I was twelve years old, I refused to go again. I hated the lake, I hated that house. I had nightmares for years and never explained to anyone why it happened.

I still don't like to talk about it. Whenever I do, I feel like I can smell that lake again. People don't realize, but lakes are dirty places. Animals piss and shit and die in them, all kinds of plants rot on the surface, people dump their garbage. There's so much water that stays clear that people think that it's clean. It's not. All the lakes I've been to have a certain *smell* like they're not totally pure. 

This lake - *my* lake - slowly developed a smell like death.

That sounds dramatic. It's not like you could just sniff the air and think "That's death." No one would have gone to the lake if it had been like that. It was just a subtle thing that you caught a whiff of once and then it was gone. Maybe you looked around you for a dead fish or squirrel or something and then you forgot about it. I probably only noticed it was getting worse because on most days I was there from sun-up to sun-down.

The dock our friends owned was a simple hand-built thing that involved Styrofoam and treated two-by-fours. A few times it had come loose from the rope that held it and had drifted across the lake. It sat sandwiched between two bigger and more impressive boathouses. As you faced the lake from the shore, the boathouse on the right was freshly painted bright red and housed a small white fishing boat. A simple pulley system allowed the boat to be lifted out of the water while it was stored in the majority of the year when it wasn't being used.

We never saw inside the boathouse on the left, and we also never saw anyone use it. It was made of plywood that had once been painted dark green, though years of weather had warped the edges of the wood and it had shed about half its paint. That summer when I was twelve, it disappeared and we all assumed that it had just been torn down so that it wouldn't be such an eyesore.

That summer was the first one that I got really into snorkeling. I had explored the surface of the lake many times before in a boat, but that summer, I got to see a whole other world hidden below the surface. My friends and I caught salamanders, built things out of cinder blocks on the sandy bottom  and found everything from fishing lures and golf balls to pieces of old boats and docks from the past.

As you might have guessed, the lake was pretty small but it was frighteningly deep. Huge trees would fall into it on occasion, become waterlogged and would turn vertically with only their roots or broken bases poking above the surface. A swimmer drowned there once and even though they used scuba equipment to try to find the body, it was never recovered. At a depth of about ten feet, the water was already as cold as it was in the winter.  At about fifteen feet, it was dark enough that a thick forest of weeds were able to grow on the bottom. Beyond was just cold and darkness.

My friend and I devised a plan to use an upside-down plastic barrel full of air and a boat anchor to allow us to dive much further than we could while only holding our breaths from the surface. We'd go out to the dive spot using a surfboard, then, with the barrel covering our heads and masks, we clutched the anchor and jumped off, quickly sinking to the bottom of the lake. You basically dove blind, since you had the bucket over your head. We could go far enough that the pressure would compress the air in the barrel to half its original size. All we had to do in order to surface was to release the anchor, and the barrel full of air would propel us quickly to the surface. Then we'd reel up the anchor with a rope and start again.

This was fun for us to see how far we could go, and we got pretty good at it. The only bad times were when we would land in the deep weeds, which instantly tangled around our legs and ankles. We never got seriously stuck, but it would freak you out when you were expecting to land with both feet on the sand and instead landed in the weeds.

On a successful dive, you could see about five to ten feet in any direction, and looking up, you could see the outline of the sun, and the long shadow of the surfboard.

The last time I ever dove into the lake - the last time I ever swam in open water - was when I found the remains of the neighbor's boathouse. It was the first dive of the day, and we had paddled the surfboard straight out from the dock, a bit further than we normally did. It was about 10:30 am, and the water was still slightly cold from the night before. I put on my mask and snorkel, put the bucket over my head and curled my legs around the anchor like normal. This day, my friend had brought his father's underwater flashlight, so I readied that as well as the bucket above my head and took the plunge. I remember falling a long time. *Too* long, because the pressure was pressing my mask against my face uncomfortably, and the air in the barrel was compressed to smaller than I'd ever seen it. The rope, holding the anchor pulled taut, and I almost lost my grip.

I don't believe in the little voice inside of a person that tells them the difference between right and wrong. I did, however, experience a very loud message from inside myself telling me that this was not a place I should be. It was too cold, too dark, and the pressure crushed in from all sides. It wasn't the first time I'd realized the absurdity of our little diving system, but it was the first time that it had struck me as being truly stupid. My body gave me the message loud and clear that I was an idiot, but my curiosity ultimately won out. Just a quick peek.

I lifted the barrel above my head, and got my first sight of how deep I'd come. I was suspended on the rope between a gradient of gray/green above me to only blackness below. If I could have looked at myself from the outside, I'm sure I'd have resembled a worm on a hook.

I had to let go of the barrel with one hand in order to grab the flashlight tucked into my swim trunks. The air in the bucket strained to float up, and the container tipped at a dangerous angle, but the bubble of air, being so compressed, stayed intact. I clicked on the flashlight, shining it down right in front of me.

The thin beam of harsh white light sprung into existence like a camera flash, and what I saw there...

People.

Pale faces through thick, motionless black hair staring up at me from inside the remains of that old green boathouse, flipped upside down or fallen apart. They were there, right below me.

I screamed, and dropped the flashlight at the same time as I kicked off from the anchor. The barrel started pulling me up to the surface, faster and faster. In a complete panic, I thrashed my remaining arm and legs in order to try to go faster. I had expelled all my air and I felt like this was the moment I was going to die. 

I felt sure that they were right behind me, their pale hands inches from my ankles. From one moment to the next felt like an eternity. The end of the rope fell past me. *Ten more feet.*

*Nine.*

*Eight.*

Fire in my empty lungs.

I don't remember breaking the surface. I do, however remember being on top of the surfboard, alternately breathing so hard that I couldn't cry and crying so hard that I couldn't take a breath as my friend pushed my to shore. Once I reached dry land, I left without looking back.

I felt then that it was so crazy, that I couldn't tell him, or my parents or anyone. There were people down there, not living people, but dead ones, with empty eyes, staring up at the gray, faraway surface. They must have been weighted down, or restrained. I don't remember.

What I do remember is that as the flashlight fell into the weeds, it shone on the most horrible part of all. The legs of one of these... things had been roughly sewn together to create the image of a grotesque mermaid, including a large and elegantly shaped black tail.

For a long time after that incident, I tried to pretend that it hadn't happened - that I hadn't seen what I thought. Trees, or logs, not twin female bodies. A patch of sand through the weeds... *Anything* to not have to accept a reality that that scene could exist in.

As an adult, I've had to accept it. I still see it in the dark. I can't escape it. I've realized that whoever owned the boathouse, must have been *experimenting*. The swimmer who disappeared was probably one of those victims. I don't know who the other woman might have been. Somehow, the bodies would have to have been preserved. The only evidence of decay being from the eyes, which still stare at me in my nightmares.

I'm still torn between wishing I'd investigated and learned more about it, and wishing to hell that I'd never, *ever* seen it. 





























 I never knew too much about Gary. He just never acted in a way that made me wonder about him personally. Perfectly uninteresting, I guess you could say.

I remember when I met him. Gary Sheffield; 27 years old; a Bachelor's in Business specializing in Accounting from a small university; 2 years of experience as a secretarial assistant; hobbies included hiking and photography.

Pretty ordinary, on paper at least. Gary was the first assistant I'd ever had since I started my own business. Gary was on top of things. He seemed to know the ins and outs of the business better than I did at times. He built rapport with our suppliers and customers, always seemed to know how to set up my days so that I'd feel productive but not overworked.

I loved Gary as an extension of growing my business and my dream. To me, his enthusiasm every day reflected the positivity of my own success. Maybe that's why I never got to know him. I never even asked him about the single picture of his wife he kept on his desk. Ask me on any given day, and I couldn't even have told you if she had blonde or brown hair or what she looked like. Just a person in a green sweater.

Then one day when Gary came back from taking a week off, unshaven and disheveled, I started to worry about him. His work performance tanked too. I caught him napping at his desk, which I guess was the straw that broke the camel's back. It wasn't even just Gary, I'd had a bad week - fighting with my wife and an increased workload meant that I'd been sleeping at the office more nights than not... but he didn't really deserve to be sent home. I never even asked him how he was.

After trying to call him a few times that night, I finally looked up the address he'd listed last year on his resum. 150 Halcourt Drive.
I typed the address into my phone's GPS when I got into the car. It pulled up directions for Halcourt drive, and I took off through the heavy rain. 20 minutes outside of town, I found myself on a gravel road in front of a closed iron gate. Closed, but not locked. There wasn't an intercom or bell in sight. There weren't even any lights out here.

I went inside the gate, sloshing through the deepening puddles in a grassy field, unable to see anything except for outlines of bushes and rocks in the corners of my vision. Then, about a hundred feet in front of me, I saw a small orange light coming from a single window.
I changed course and headed straight toward the small cabin, but slipped on the wet earth and caught my shoulder on a huge rock.
Some yard I thought, as I stood up, rubbing my shoulder. Finally I remembered that my phone had a light on it. As the LED lit up the rock that I'd fallen on, my breath caught in my throat.

1986 - 2011 

I will never leave your side. There will never be another.

I quickly turned off the light. A tombstone. His wife's tombstone. Oh my god I thought. That poor miserable boy.

I had to go see him. I had to apologize. Whatever I could do for him... I was prepared to do it.

I walked quickly up to the cabin and knocked on the door. It wasn't latched, and the rickety door was pushed open from the single knock.

Inside was a single room with a bed, a toilet, a camera on a tripod, a girl in a green sweater chained to the floor screaming and a hundred pictures pinned to the wall - a hundred different girls in green sweaters. 



















 Hello. I own a Dell XPS 14 laptop. I don't know very much about computers... but a few weeks ago three of the function keys (F4, F5, and F6) stopped working. All the keys around them work without problem. I tried messing with it a little, updating BIOS chipset drivers, etc. and after calling Dell, I sent it in to their depot for maintenance.

They said that the spill sensors had been tripped and that I'd have to replace the motherboard for half of what I paid for the computer in the first place!

**TL;DR, My question is:** How do I know for sure whether it's actually the motherboard or just the keyboard that went bad? Obviously money is a bit of an issue. (Isn't it for everyone?)

Thanks in advance!

 At work we had an air compressor and hose set up like in the picture [here](http://imgur.com/UIs0nhH.jpg).

At the end of the hose is a partially open valve. The gauge on that valve is periodically calibrated. The gauge built into the air compressor is not regularly calibrated.

The gauge on the air compressor *always* reads higher than the gauge on the end of the hose, no matter what position the shutoff valve is in. There are no obvious leaks in the hose assembly or air compressor.

#1 says that there is never a perfectly sealed system, and because of that, pressure from the compressor leaks out between the gauges and doesn't transfer all the way to the second one.

#2 says that pressure must press out constantly in all directions (Pascal's Law) and that the gauge at the compressor must be off by some amount.

It's on!

EDIT: So the situation is this: Person #1 is running the air compressor and reading that gauge, and 30 feet away Person #2 is manning the shutoff valve and reading the gauge there. There needs to be 75 psi at the end of the hose for what we need it to do. Person #1 cranks up the air compressor to 75 psig, but on #2's gauge it only reads 50 psig. For safety, neither of us wants to exceed, say, 100 psi on the hose. #2 says the gauge is wrong, and that #1 is only actually dialing the compressor up to ~50 psi, but person #1 says that both gauges are accurate and to get 75 psig at the shutoff valve, you would have to exceed the 100 psi limit.

It always feels weird to go home. Surreal, like somehow walking into someone else's life; it's not mine anymore. The scenery changes very little over the years in small towns, but the things that happen there no longer concern me. My stresses and routines exist somewhere else while these ones have gone cold like the still air in the empty bedroom in my parent's house.

Mom was happy to see me. It had been over a year since I'd visited her, and she'd aged years in that time. Her hair was shorter, and flatter, and she had new glasses whose thick, brown frames made her face seem even thinner.

I couldn't tell her everything. It was just too weird, and my thoughts were too disorganized. I told her that Mark was missing, and I was expecting the police or someone to come looking for me in the morning. I talked for a little while about the rest of my time in Thailand, and then shut myself in my room. I fell onto my old bed, and was asleep.

I'm having weird dreams every night now. In them, I'll go places and talk to people like I would if I were awake. There are usually just bits and pieces - tall shelves, faceless men in suits and a few times now I've dreamed of the red tree. They feel like dreams the next day... but sometimes while they're going on, I'm afraid that I might wake up, standing in the middle of that shop in Thailand, Alan smiling at me with broken teeth, and empty eyes like Mark's mask.

I woke up at midnight. After tossing and turning, I gave up the fight to keep my eyes closed. I checked reddit on my phone while laying draped over the edge of my old bed. Damn, some of you seem to have it even worse than I do. Others of your stories are eerily similar. Out of curiosity, I decided to search for the post I'd found before, "All In Good Time."

Everything was almost exactly the same except for two things: the score was much higher and it had more comments than it had the first time. The second thing that had changed was the address. Instead of Pattaya, Thailand, it now had the name of my home town in Oregon. Google Maps pointed to a place about a mile and a half from my house.

I was tempted to go there. *Drawn.* Something pulled at the strings inside my head, puppeting my hands as I got dressed and laced my shoes. Just before I reached the front door, I stopped and stood for a full minute in my mom's living room. Just to see if I could.

This wasn't a dream. I wasn't sleepwalking. I wasn't possessed. I just... needed to know.

Out the front door, I pulled my hoodie tighter around my shoulders against the cold and stuffed my hands deeper into my pockets. It was colder here than Thailand had been, especially in the middle of the night. In high school I used to walk like this all the time, just setting out without a place to go. I planned on going near the store, but not inside. I wanted to see it, but for now... I was just walking.

As I reached the more populated areas, I passed more people out on the street. I skirted the lights and hoped that no one would try to talk to me and kept up a pretty fast pace.

I reached the place on the map where it had said the store would be. It was in the middle of a strip of little shops - book stores, antiques, boutique clothes. At first glance, I wasn't sure it was the place. It was conspicuously empty and barren. A white sign with red lettering read "For Sale" on the largest window. On my toes, I was just able to see through the windows to the shadowy empty shelves inside.

"There you are," said a voice behind me. I spun and saw a man leaning out the window of an impeccable white convertible Mustang. The car hadn't made a sound before, but now the engine was chugging in a low growl. It was the shop owner from Thailand still wearing the same suit that I'd seen him in before. His crooked teeth were on display through a thin-lipped smile. He looked slightly deranged. "I was hoping I'd find you here. It seems to me like you've got something I want. Two somethings, actually." He licked his lips as he looked me up and down.

"Fuck off!" I screamed as I kicked his car with a muddy sneaker.

Faster than I could react, he was out of the car and coming toward me. With surprising strength, he shoved me against the window behind me.

"Listen, you little bitch. You made a deal," He growled like an animal. Every word was punctuated with pain. He seemed to be all elbows beneath his jacket. Insanely, my biggest fear in that moment was that he would bite or claw me. He was panting, and his hot breath smelled strongly of stale tobacco.

Then his smile returned. He released me from the wall and took a step back, straightening his tie and jacket.

"Tomorrow night, before the sun rises, I expect to have the watch delivered to me. I'll warn you though, I don't give extensions easily, miss."

So that was it. He was after the pocket watch.

He ducked back into the ghostly white Mustang and slowly rolled down the street and out of sight.

My heart was nearly beating a hole through my chest. I pulled myself up from where I'd collapsed on the sidewalk and ran until I saw perhaps the only place still open in town that late at night. With no one in sight, I leaned against the wall and caught my breath before turning the corner and entering Rustic Sports Bar.

"Hi, we close in an hour!" shouted the woman from the behind the bar.

I told her that was fine and ordered a drink, downed it and ordered another. The noise and movement of the games replaying on the televisions was calming, though I wished that more people were there. I was afraid to go back outside.

After another drink and a few more commercial breaks, someone came up behind me.

"Hey I know you, don't I?" said a male voice.

It was some guy who I recognized him from high school. His name was Ben. He was a couple years older than me and we'd hever hung out, but was really well-known for being the school's star basketball player. I'd heard a lot of rumors of teachers being forced to give him extra credit and turning D's to B's to keep him on the team. There was pressure to keep him playing, but there was more pressure from his wealthy and well-connected father.

I guess the rumors had been true, since after he'd gone to play at a Division 1 school on a scholarship, he'd failed out after the first semester because of his grades. He looked like he spent more time in the bar than on the basketball court these days.

He was obnoxious and drunk, but talking to someone eased my nerves. When the bar closed, I convinced him to give me a ride back home. I dodged his clumsy attempt to kiss me and tried to ignore his creeping hands. It took him a while for him to understand that he wasn't invited inside. The tires of his too-expensive car squealed as he took off down the street.

---

I was seven when my mom finally left my dad. The fight before the split dragged on all night. I guess that they'd each just had enough, and threw everything they had at each other. A few months later, he passed away and at his funeral, my uncle had said that it was because of a broken heart. Even at seven I'd known that he'd never had one to begin with.

Anyway, I remember packing my toys on the day that we left. I was a serious tomboy at that age, and didn't own even a single pink thing. All my toys were the cool boy toys of the 90's. I carefully appraised each one before putting it into the blue Jansport backpack I used for school. They wouldn't all fit, and I had to take apart my Legos to pack them down better. I worried that she'd make me leave them when I came out of my room, backpack full and carrying Stretch Armstrong and Buzz Lightyear in my arms. She didn't say anything though. She just packed some pictures and our clothes into a couple suitcases and then we got into her car and went to grandma's.

I stayed with grandma for a long time before mom came back. I don't think that she had a place to stay, so she left me there where I'd be safe. I hadn't really minded, since grandma's house was amazing. I missed the last month or so of school, and then it was summer. 

I played outside every minute of the day, and whenever I came inside with grass stains on my knees and scrapes on my elbows, grandma would tell me how that was "just the way it should be," then she'd make me open-faced peanut butter and jelly sandwiches that were somehow sweeter and more delicious than the kind anyone else made.

The forest behind her house seemed huge. There were a few miles of hiking trails that no one owned or ever used that fed down from the main road along the top of the hill to the big lake at the bottom. Gradually, like entropy, the toys I'd brought in my backpack got spread out to all my favorite spots in the woods. Stretch Armstrong died in a tree-climbing accident when his rubbery legs got caught on a broken branch. He bled sticky corn syrup all over the pine needles and my hands and he slowly deflated.

I knew that there was no way to bring him back, so instead I reasoned that a fitting memorial would be to tie him at the very highest point of the tree, where his plastic smiling face could look out over the woods and the lake forever. He'd be the one in the crow's nest whenever I played pirates on the ground.

The tree wobbled as I climbed it. I was a skinny kid, but the tree was thinner, and it bent precariously. I quickly tied his arms and legs in double granny knots and raised him into his final resting place, then I looked out where his blank eyes were looking.

Straight ahead, not far away, reflections of clouds were swimming in the still blue lake. Going west would take me back to grandma's house, and to the east was more forest, and fewer houses until you went all the way out to the Boy Scout camp. From our perch, Armstrong and I could see their dock poking out from the shore. Just past that, something red caught my eye.

I double checked Stretch - he looked happy in his final resting place - then climbed down, found my best stick-sword and headed off toward the lake. My imagination was always in overdrive then, but now there was something real to investigate. I thought about what I'd do if it were a hot air balloon whose pilot needed my help to get back into the air. I shuddered to think what if it were a UFO?

I hugged the shoreline, moving quick to keep my feet from sinking in the soft sand. I passed a forked tree, the base of which held three of my power rangers, waiting for Zordon's call for their next adventure. 

You had to be careful going into the Boy Scout's territory, and normally I never played in there. Girls weren't allowed. If an adult found you, they could have you "thrown out" according to my grandma. I knew that she meant that someone's dad would call and have you picked up, but I'd always imagined a band of scouts tying me up with chains and padlocks and tossing me off the end of the dock.

Thankfully no one was there this time. I didn't need to, but snuck through the campground like Mission Impossible anyway, eyes wide and ears open for any sound. Everything was completely silent. Strangely so.

I'd imagined a hundred things that the red spot I'd seen from the crow's nest could be. The logical side of my brain had even considered a piece of garbage, or the Boy Scouts' misplaced canoe. The only thing I hadn't allowed myself to consider was that it was just another tree.

Most of the trees in the forest were the kind with needles. In fact, the only trees I saw with leaves were the apple trees my grandma had planted in front of her house. As I came up on the curious red tree with five-pointed maple leaves, I wondered if maybe this tree had been planted too. Nothing else was growing for 30 or 40 feet in every direction around it. Each one of its leaves glowed bright, deep red like cranberry juice.

I snuck forward, casting one last look back to the empty camp, and the direction of grandma's house. It was starting to get that cool feeling that you get at the end of the day. I'd have to start back soon, or race the sun for its remaining light. 

I stepped into the circle of dead around the tree, and a weird, irritating sensation washed over me. The evening air was no longer cold. Actually, it felt like heat was emanating straight up out of the ground. There was a smell with it too, like must and decomposition. I had the strong feeling that I was some place I shouldn't have been, like I had entered some kind of memorial or grave that I shouldn't have been treading on.

So I left. After sneaking through the camp and the woods, I got back to grandma's just as it was getting dark, sat at the table until I cleaned my plate, and forgot the whole thing.

Days came and went without a care or a thing to do. I started to feel like my time at grandma's would just go on forever. That was the life. I hoped that nothing would ever change.

But change came knocking on the front door as I was getting ready for bed. I was brushing my teeth in the downstairs bathroom, pajamas already on and eyelids heavy.

The knocking came, but it sounded more like someone was kicking the door. I heard my father's voice. Even through the thick, wooden frame, it echoed through the house. He was calling my name, and calling grandma something else.

Grandma rushed downstairs to get me, and whisked me up into the attic through a set of trapdoor stairs. She took something that looked like a briefcase with a lock on it, except it was almost as long as she was tall, then she kissed the top of my head and went back down the stairs, closing the trapdoor behind her.

I crawled over the insulation, and looked out through the window with one eye. I could see my father's truck, but one side of the hood had been dented in. The bed looked like it was full of cans and bottles. I could still hear him screaming, but it didn't sound like he was at the front door anymore. 

I heard a crash downstairs, like a window breaking and then a bang that shook the walls and made me cover my ears. My father and my grandma were screaming worse than when mom and he had fought, then grandma went quiet.

There was a latch on the attic window, which pushed open and let me out onto the roof. From there I dropped down onto the garage like dropping out of a tree. I tried to climb down the rain gutter from the garage to the ground, but it wasn't fastened. With a screech and moan of twisting hollow metal, I dropped onto the damp ground and ran barefoot into the woods. A minute later, I could hear my father calling my name.

I didn't care. My fear gave me wings carried me away.

I had hiding spots. These were *my* woods, after all. If I'd wanted to, I could have hidden all night. To this day, I still don't know why I didn't do exactly that, but before I'd started running, even before I'd unlatched the window and gone outside, I'd known that I was going back to the red tree.

My father bounded loudly through the brush like a mindless hulk behind me. I moved quietly along the edge of the lake, like I'd done a thousand times before.

There were lights on at the Boy Scout camp. I could have run there for help, waking them in their cabins, but something about the tree was calling me just a little further ahead. My father had stopped yelling, and had cleared the trees and underbrush. I didn't know where he was.

I saw the tree for a second - bared of all its leaves, its trunk now bleached white, before the ground dropped out from beneath my feet. The whole dead circle around the tree had sunken several feet, and was now filled with rainwater. Shed bark and leaves covered the surface like tissue paper and shattered black ice. The water was warm, almost hot. I broke the surface and swam the best I could toward its bone white trunk, like a marble statue of a graceful hand reaching out of the muck.

"Allie!" my father called from behind me, teetering on the edge of the circle, holding a rifle. "I'm not gonna tell you again, Allie, get out of there, right now."

My fingers closed around the trunk of the tree. It was so slick. I'd climbed trees every day for the past two months, and even had a growth spurt, but there was no way to climb that tree.

My stomach fell. Despite all my imagination, I hadn't thought of what to do now that I'd made it there. I had failed. I gripped the branches and shook them in frustration. What had I thought was going to happen?

"You're going to make me do this, girl. You and and that damned mother of yours."

He had the rifle up at his shoulder, eye in the sights and finger on the trigger. I ducked sideways, sinking back under the water. Instead of a gunshot, there was silence like I'd gone deaf. Lights played across my closed eyelids. I felt the water swirling around me, throwing me limply around, and stretching me like thin rubber filled with corn syrup.

Then... it was over. I was sitting at the top of the white maple, my legs dangling below. The place that my father had been standing just a moment ago was illuminated by the headlights of a police cruiser. They were so afraid at first that I'd been shot. The water, dyed red by the fallen leaves had soaked me like blood.

In my hand, I found a tiny pocketwatch. The inside isn't a mermaid in the water... it's me.

Eventually - unbelieveably - I forgot... I forgot about the tree. I forgot how my father had disappeared. I forgot everything until it found me again in Thailand.

I don't know why it chose that place or that time, or why it waited so long to find me, but now it has. It found me in Thailand, but I think somehow that it's never been far away... and it will be waiting for me when I get back home.

It's waited all this time, and now it's coming for me.
 




 Hopefully I'll be able to explain more tomorrow.

This isn't even close to being finished.

It found me in Thailand.

I came here with my best friend Mark for a 30-day volunteer trip. We're both graduating from college next year and we've been told that "extracurriculars" like this look good on a resume. The company that Mark's father works for paid for the whole thing. More important than the practical reasons, neither of us had ever been that far outside of the U.S., and you're not going to pass up a free trip to Thailand.

The work was easy. All we had to do was basically show up and lend an extra set of hands when and where it was needed. Our busy days combined with a healthy dash of culture shock made the time fly by. Before we knew it, we were being bused to Pattaya and preparing to fly home.

Pattaya isn't as wild as Bangkok, but it's got a firm grip on the second-place title. Every night of the year is a party. Downtown, there are bars and massage parlors on every corner. The hotel they put us at was right in the middle of it all.

We were supposed to stay one night there and then leave for Hawaii the following morning, but a potential hurricane in Hawaii and monsoons threatening Thailand canceled any flights that way until further notice. Mark called the volunteer organization to let them know, and everything was taken care of. They were amazingly understanding of the whole thing, and they even agreed to wire us some extra per diem to offset the cost of living in downtown.

Mark and I were 21 years old, sex and alcohol deprived for the last 30 days, and fate just plopped into our laps at least two days in Thailand, all expenses paid. We were living in a dream.

The first evening, we walked all over downtown. We knew we'd end up hitting the bars that night, but at about 5:00 pm, I thought it was a little early to get tanked. They've got about a million shops that sell cheap, knock-off goods, and the street food is fresh-cooked and out of this world, so despite Mark's bitching, we paced ourselves.

It was the last place we were going to go before we quit shopping and started partying. 

Most of the booths and open-air vendors specialize in selling one type of thing. One guy will sell T-shirts. The next store will have fake brand-name headphones and electronics. The next will sell toys, luggage, purses, shoes... The point is, this store was different. It had *everything* - completely eclectic.

I'm in love. Every single piece has so much personality. They're the kinds of things that represent a story, someone's childhood, a life. Someone's stack of handwritten journals, antiques, a weathered leather briefcase with papers sticking out of the edges, a taped BB gun, a bike, a wedding dress...

We're the only people there besides the vendor, whose name tag reads "ALAN," who's standing behind a small counter, almost like a podium, and eying us while fiddling with something in his hands.

Mark doesn't care about the churchlike quiet because he's trying to get me to hurry up and go, so when the vendor greets us and says something about a "good time" Mark practically shouts, "Yeah! We're looking for a good time!"

The vendor smiles, and then brings something up to his mouth. With his other hand, he throws some pistachio shells into a little bin by his feet.

He wipes his hands on the pants of his black suit, and waves to Mark to follow him to the other side of the store. "Everything is for trade here. I collect all sorts of things, as you can see. I believe that I have just what you're looking for." The place is small, and in only a few steps, he's reached the wall that's furthest from the rust-colored windows. The vendor bends down, reaches into a wooden cupboard and pulls out a silver tea set. A steaming pot, cups, the whole shebang.

He smiles wide, showing rows of broken, tar-stained teeth, and holds up the tea saying, "Drink this, and I can guarantee that you'll have an unforgettable night."

The scent of the tea was amazing. Beyond amazing, it was unlike anything I'd ever experienced. It seemed to fill the entire shop in an instant. The smell of dust and age was gone, and I found myself daydreaming about my grandmother's house as a kid. 

In the summers, my dad would be out of work a lot. Whenever he was home, my mom and him would get into fights. When things got really shitty, they'd send me to stay the weekends with my mom's mom. Somehow it smelled just like the sunshine that shone through the woods behind her house that were all mine whenever I went there. It smelled like freedom and fun, adventure and good times.

After that, everything is blank. I don't even remember sitting down or drinking the tea. The very next thing that I remember is Mark saying "I gotta take a shit after this, my stomach is killing."

We were sitting in leather reclining chairs, having our feet massaged. I felt the familiar buzz of alcohol, but otherwise felt awake and normal.

I looked over at Mark, and noticed that he was wearing different clothes; black pants and a matching button-up shirt had replaced his colorful board shorts and tee, and for some reason he was carrying white mask like a mannequin's face.

Outside, the sun was gone and the rain was hammering down in sheets onto the muddy streets. When I got up to pay and leave, I found a big wad of Thai baht in my pocket equal to just over $1100 USD and a note in my own handwriting.

    Don't let him have it.

I rushed outside into the rain. Mark cut his massage short and followed after me, collecting his shoes from the flimsy wooden rack outside.

"What the fuck is going on with you, Allie?"

"I can't remember anything."

"Yeah, you're probably fucked up from all the drinks you've had, I told you to slow down at that last place-"

"No. I don't even remember drinking. Mark, I'm serious, the last thing I remember is going into that little shop, and the guy serving us tea."

Mark smiled and stared at me for a second. "This is weird, Allie, I don't get it. Not a very good joke."

"You remember?"

"Remember? Yeah, of course, I remember the weird tea guy yesterday, what about it?"

*Yesterday? What the hell had happened all night?*

It was too much, I could hardly breathe. I sat hard on the crumbling curb, while cars and mopeds darted just inches from my feet.

"Uh... Hey, if you're like, sick or something, maybe we should go, but we can't just sit right here like this, they're going to find us." He pulled me up by the shoulder.

"Who's going to find us?"

"Those guys with the fliers that we were fucking with. You know, I was wearing the mask, and walking back and forth taking their fliers, until they started chasing us off... Holy shit, you really don't remember, do you?"

"I can't remember shit. I need..." *A doctor? A priest? A psychiatrist?* "I don't know. How do we get back to the hotel from here?"

---

We each had separate rooms in the hotel, both on the seventh floor. From the elevator, Mark's room was the first door on the right, while mine was near the end of the balcony to the left. On the way over, Mark had complained about his stomach hurting again and had eventually gone quiet, holding one arm across his gut. Maybe it was just some kind of sympathy pain, but my stomach felt like it was starting to cramp as well. When we got out of the elevator he rushed over to his room.

"I'll call you in a little while," I said, unsure if he heard me or not before he disappeared into his door.

I went toward my room, and followed the convex curve of the building. When I rounded the final turn, I saw Mark in his black clothes, with his blank white mask on standing outside my room, then push his way inside and out of sight.

I froze. The balcony didn't go in a circle. There was no way that he could have gotten around me.

I walked backwards, eye on my door until I was out of sight, then ran back to Mark's room and pounded my fists on his door. He didn't answer, even when I yelled his name and pleaded.

I stood knocking for several minutes, trying to watch both sides of the balcony for signs of him or someone in a white mask. Then my stomach cramped. The sharp pain doubled me over. Once the pain cleared, I wiped the tears from my eyes and went back into the elevator.

Some Indian tourists were already standing on the tiny box before I got on, and said something in a language I didn't understand. I'm sure I looked crazy. Another wave of pain came on the way down. I tried to ignore it, and focused instead on the watercolor painting of a red maple tree that hung on the back of the elevator. Someone had burned a cigarette-sized hole through the canvas at some point before it had been set in its frame. I tried to burn another hole through it with my eyes, and bit my cheek to keep from screaming.

The pain subsided slightly when I got to the bottom floor. The Indian family rushed away from me, and I dizzily stumbled out of the lobby and into the street.

I nearly got run over by a pickup and then a taxi cab as I crossed the street to a 7-Eleven. People were shouting at me from the sidewalk, but I couldn't make out their faces through the pouring rain.

Another wave of pain washed over me as I was met by the blinding white lights inside the shop. I fell to my knees and everything in my stomach lurched up onto the ground. It felt like I was vomiting shards of glass set on fire. With every heave, I felt like my throat was tearing.

it went on and on, leaving me laying on the ground, gasping for breath.

Pistachio shells, a mound of them, lay on the ground in the center of a bloody puddle. On the top of the pile was a tiny ornate pocket watch with a delicate silver chain.

---

Paramedics scooped me up off the floor of the 7-eleven. The Thai hospital was surprisingly modern, the staff seemed to be well-trained and polite. Despite most of the rest of the city appearing to exist sometime in the past decade, the ER was comfortingly modern. I was put in a bay, curtain dividers between beds. Primarily male nurses hustled about, checking fluids and medicines. Apparently, there isn't much you can do for esophageal bleeding besides ensuring that the person remains calm and doesn't try to eat anything.

I found my phone on the table along with my keys, my rifled-through wallet and the pocket watch. I was surprised again to find that there was free WiFi inside the hospital. I searched for the strange shop with the tea on Google, but it was like Google Maps didn't exist yet in this country, and practically no businesses were listed. Review sites and listings were worthless without already knowing the name of the place.

        15% battery remaining.

I tried sending another text to Mark. Then, thinking I'd earned a short break, I opened up Reddit...

And there it was.

"All In Good Time," was right at the top of my front page. It was here - in nosleep. Strictly speaking, I didn't even think that the story belonged. It was more of a review of the shop that sold anything and everything you could want, located at 1111  street, just a few blocks from the hotel that we'd stayed at. According to OP, you could find any and everything you wanted, "as well as a few things that they hadn't known that they needed before they walked through the door."

As I said, the post wasn't the kind of thing that belonged on nosleep, except for maybe the strange description of the owner named Alan. The man that we'd seen at All In Good Time had been an elderly Thai man, but the man in the post was described as white with a southern accent and a habit of chain-smoking. 

What was even stranger about the post was that shouldn't have been at the top of my front page. It only had a few dozen points and I didn't know how it could possibly have been right, but its time stamp was a month old.

Thinking I'd missed something, I scrolled down to the comments section. A few rulebreakers were calling out OP for posting something "unrealistic," while most others said that the shop was in their home town, and that they couldn't wait to check it out later that week. Apparently Pattaya is full of Redditors...

One comment in particular stood out to me, though. The time stamp said 1 minute ago when I found it. I copied and pasted it below:

MarkyShark  3 minutes ago  1 point

its all i know  
the dark the cold  
these four walls  
when night falls  
youll see it too 

It was Mark's account. He was alive! I quietly cursed him for not answering my texts. I tapped on his name to see if he'd posted anything else recently but there was nothing older than that day. On the second picture, my phone died.

I set it back on the table and picked up the pocketwatch. I'd gotten it after my father had died. It was no bigger than a quarter, with a little knob and a ring for the chain. Pulling the knob out would allow you to wind it, and pushing it in would open the polished silver clamshell. Inside were tiny moving pieces showing a mermaid swimming in wavy water. She'd drop below the surface as the waves would rise up, and break the surface again and again. I've never seen anything else like it in my life.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHssd14YyYo spfreload=10) is the closest thing I could find, but imagine it being absolutely tiny, tucked into a coin-sized watch.

It was frustrating and confusing not to remember the night before. I must have swallowed it along with everything else - but why?

A doctor opened the curtain, breaking into my thoughts, and set a cardboard box on the floor beside my bed.

He spoke in incomprehensibly fast Thai, while making hand signals that I should hold out my arm and roll up my sleeve. From the box, he pulled one of those blood pressure sleeves. He took my vitals, which resulted in a frown. Then had me say "Ah" and looked down my throat with a flashlight. More frowns. He made the motion of bringing a cup to his lips and drinking, and made what I thought was a questioning face. I nodded yes, apparently not fully understanding. He made the motion again. I said yes again, and he grew more impatient.

From his box, he pulled a glass jar with a rubber cork that had a small fitting on the top. He set them on the rolling tray beside my bed, then he pulled out a piece of elastic surgical tubing and a clear plastic tube, which he fitted onto the cork. Then, from his pocket he took out a needle. He wrapped the surgical tubing around my arm, had me flex my hand a few times to find the vein and started to draw blood into the container.

This was weird. Thinking that maybe I had accidentally agreed to something I shouldn't have, I just waited awkwardly. Small talk isn't my strong suit anyway, let alone with someone who doesn't speak the same language. To avoid making eye contact, I scanned the patterns on the curtains while the container filled up. Behind me on the wall, where I hadn't looked before, was a painting. A watercolor that someone had burned a cigarette-sized hole into before they'd framed it.

The scene in this painting was slightly different than the one in the elevator. Instead of a red maple, this one was a red circular pool with two lines sticking out of it like hands on a clock. One line was just a negative white space that pointed straight up. The other was black, like a shadow cast by the white hand, that stretched horizontally over the edge of the red pool. At the very end of that black, tapering line, was the cigarette burn. The painting *felt* different too. The last one, I had felt was irritating for some reason. If that one was a little kid with a squirt gun, this one was like a cool, still pond.

I'm sorry if that doesn't make sense. I just don't know a better way to describe how a picture makes you hear silence, and can take you to another place like that.

I must have stared for a while - for too long, because when I looked back, the doctor was gone, along with the jar. The needle was still in my arm, pouring blood through the tube into the empty box, staining the edges red. I pulled the needle out of my arm, scrambled to throw the blankets and sheets off myself, grabbed my things from the table, and shot through the curtain into the bay. I was scared, but more than that, I was fucking mad.

A quick look back showed the box had fallen on its side. Its lid now appeared be sealed shut with bleeding tape. Nurses and cleaning staff were staring at me, calling out to me in Thai, but in a few seconds I was back outside in the rain.

I found my way back to the hotel. The elevator walls now only held mirrors that showed bags under my eyes, the same ratty t-shirt from the previous day, and hair stuck out in every direction. Between the mirrors, there were advertisements for restaurants and Ripley's Believe it or Not! I didn't believe it, but I also didn't give a shit anymore. At the seventh floor, I almost went right to knock on Mark's door, but decided against it. I had to worry about myself first. Once I was safely headed away from this hellhole, I could worry about Mark.

I opened the door to my room, and fumbled with the light switch without stepping inside. The room was clear. I checked the closet, under the beds, the balcony, and locked the conjoining door and the deadbolt to the outside. I put some heavy wooden chairs in front of the entrances and turned on the TV for background noise.

If they were ever going to believe me, I had to at least look sane. I showered with both eyes open, scanning through the glass window-walls to the rest of the room. I kept imagining a disembodied white mask floating in the air, watching me with blank eyes.

Nothing happened. I got dressed, grabbed my things and left. I never went within ten feet of the cardboard box sitting in the far corner of the room. I took a picture, but it didn't turn out - just black.

The cab driver had some trouble understanding that I wanted to go to the American Embassy. There had to be one, I didn't care if it was in Bangkok. Luckily, there was one in the city.

It seemed like they questioned me for hours... They couldn't find the name of the volunteer organization that had sent us, and the only deposits on our cards had come directly from Mark's dad's credit card. They tried to find a hole in my story, but I just came clean. I gave them everything I knew, which wasn't much. I wrote down a timeline from the time we'd gotten there to now and whenever they'd ask a question, I'd just point to it.

I insisted that I couldn't stay in Thailand; that someone was after me and my friend. It wasn't until they went to Mark's room that they finally believed me at all. An officer of some sort pulled the suited man who was in charge aside and showed him something on his phone. The man put his hand over his mouth and looked away.

When they came back, I was assigned an escort, and was taken via military jet to Hawaii. Before I left, the man in a plain gray suit covered with official-looking laminated badges said that they'd take care of everything there.

I thought that it was over, then. When we were safely up in the air, I pulled a borrowed blanket over my face, and quietly cried. It wasn't long before the droning of the engines and gentle rocking of the air currents put me to sleep.
 




 Wow I want to believe that that was actually written by OP's grandfather. Such a cool story, especially if that's the case. 




 Finally got around to reading part 1. It's a long one, but the way it's told is unlike anything else I've read here. Good find. 




 Hey thanks for sharing this story. That's a really neat idea to make up an urban legend and tell it different ways.

I wonder if the post might have been more popular if you'd excluded the other links at the beginning of the post. I initially thought that I was missing something and that I'd have to go back to part one and read the whole series, but that didn't seem to be the case.

Thanks again for sharing! 




 This is why you're the man. 




 I awoke to the sound of glass breaking. Then I felt the impact of the car and the seatbelt digging into my stomach and shoulder.

I'd been driving two hours to my new job for three months. A job isn't even "new" at that point, I guess, it's just a job. The last week, I'd stepped up the amount of hours and I couldn't even remember seeing the sun. I went to work before dawn and got back after midnight every single day.

It was too much, I guess, and I fell asleep. I blamed myself every day for it. I thought about all the things I might have been able to do to prevent it. I just... couldn't take it back.

I went to her funeral. It felt wrong not to for some reason. Almost no one was there. Two middle-aged people I'd assumed to be her parents, an elderly man and the priest. Everything was extremely formal, dry and felt pre-packaged. The words that were said felt fake. It was a Hallmark funeral.

Afterwards, I went to talk to the girl's parents. I had to apologize in person, despite the advice of my lawyers.

"Excuse me? Sorry... I..." My tongue twisted. Maybe I should have written something down.

But then, bizarrely, they both smiled and shook my hand. "Hello. We know who you are. Thank you. Thank you so much."

I was shocked. Even more, I was offended. What about the girl we'd just buried? Didn't she deserve... some emotion? Some hate for her killer?

"Krista was a troubled child. I don't know how you could understand without having met her."

"Yes, deeply troubled."

"You see, we used to have four children."

"And now... well, now we have none."

"It was Krista."

"We can't prove that - "

"But we know it was her. They all died in their sleep."

"She posed their bodies."

"They looked so peaceful."

Tears were welling in both of their eyes. I felt sick.

"She finally looked peaceful, sir. So thank you."

"Thank you so much."

I was glad that I went to the funeral. Finally. I had no regret; I knew that despite everything that had happened, this was the fate she deserved. 




 This is nice. The whole thing just has that feeling of being well-said.

 New Orleans, a new drunk on the market and flags 

I moved to New Orleans when I was in my early 20's and before Katrina hit, the place was awesome with a capital A. I loved the culture, the parties, the parades, Mardis Gras... Everything.

When the hurricane hit and the city went under, I was stupid. I didn't listen and didn't believe that something that bad could happen. A lot of people didn't. I didn't get out in time.

Everyone knows that things changed after the storm and the floods, but... I think what I saw was something different. Bear with me, I've never told anyone about this before.

The hurricane affected my neighborhood pretty much like every other neighborhood in New Orleans. The days following were something else, though. I came back to my house to find that almost nothing was left. The basic structure was (fortunately) still standing, but water had risen up to the gutters. The insides were trashed.

That night, some men came by wearing suits. We thought that they were from the government - they were very official-looking. But instead of... inspections, aid, assistance, whatever, they were selling drugs! I couldn't believe it - here we were without fresh water, food, clothes, shelter... and these assholes were selling drugs!

I'm not the confrontational type, but I stared them down until they were off my block.

The next day I started noticing flags being set up outside my neighbors' houses - almost all of them. An identical black flag hung in front of their front door. I knocked on the house next door to see if they were home. Maybe I'd slept through some kind of aid effort? Maybe the flags signified that the house was occupied or... I don't know. I just didn't want to be left out.

My neighbor Charles answered the door. I'd never seen him look so terrible. I mean, terrible had been re-defined by surviving a natural disaster, that was a given, but his lips were blue, and I swear his eyes were faded, turning white.

He opened the door and I asked him about the flag. He just wandered inside his house, sat on the couch and didn't say a word. His wife and daughter were there on the couch too. They were all staring at a black TV screen (we didn't have any power).

The neighbors across the street were exactly the same. I started suspecting that everyone with a black flag in front of their steps had turned into some kind of mindless drone.

It lasted for two full days. On the third morning everyone was back to normal.

I think... somehow, it saved their lives. I was struggling during that time just to live. Just to not be poisoned and to get by, but everyone else... it's like they had a free pass for two days. 









 /r/nosleep, we like you, but you're more fun when you're drunk. 




 This is the only serious answer here. 




 Not at all what I had expected from the title.

I pictured a kid knocking on a fish tank, or Dudley knocking on the snake's glass at the zoo. "Come on! Come out! We just want to play with you." 




 The title and premise is so zany, but man, this story just works! 




 I could picture this place so well. Terrifying. 




 Oh my god. Awesome. 




 Officers were waiting in front of my house in unmarked cars. I didn't even have time to get my bag out of my car before they had me in cuffs and carried me roughly into the back of a black SUV. At the station they asked me about a childhood friend, Rick. I hadn't seen him in twenty years - we used to frequent the same playset in school before he moved away. They shoved pictures under my nose of a crashed car, a bloody street, drag marks in the dirt leading from the highway and into the woods. I had nothing to do with it, I swear.

Hours passed, and they finally let me go. When I got home, it was after midnight. A cold breeze was blowing in through a broken window. Rick was standing in the shadows of my kitchen, a slit of light cast across his stubbled face.

"You said we'd always be best friends, Trev. I need a friend. I think I did something bad." 




 Thanks, brah!

 Before my senior year of high school, I volunteered to be a camp counselor for the summer. The experience was life-changing for me in more ways than one. It was what made me decide to become a teacher. It gave me self-confidence and an excitement for leadership that I'd never had before.

As a counselor, you typically ran an activity station for a few hours at a time. The kids were old enough to decide for themselves what they wanted to do during free time. The coordinated events were put on by the full-time employees, as well as the running of the facilities and the dorms. (Most parents wouldn't have let their kids stay a week with a bunch of irresponsible high schoolers.)

I was typically in charge of the giant tree swing and the arts and crafts stations. I'd trade back and forth every day with another counselor named Leslie.

Kids were in camp for 5 days. On day three I ran out of ideas for what to do in the arts and crafts station. They had all kinds of supplies - rope, string and beads for making necklaces and bracelets, paints and easels, a whole bundle of knitting needles and string... the only problem was that I didn't know how to do any of those things very well.

Then in one of the cupboards I found some quilting supplies. Weirdly, I knew how to do that from trips to my grandmother's house as a kid. The rest of the day, I organized the camp quilting club. It really caught on. Our quilt looked terrible - stuffing poked out and threads ran along the ground - but the kids loved it.

On the third day, I noticed that we were running low on patches. I went back into the cupboard, and stuffed into the back, I found a whole quilt. I had no choice but to cannibalize it for the cause. I started cutting off the patches. I had a small pile started, when I started to notice that the filling of this quilt wasn't cotton. It was stringy and stretchy. It might have been some kind of sawdust.

Old Mrs. Collins, one of the permanent employees working there, bustled into the shed, and shrieked with fear when she saw what I was doing. She barreled over and ripped the quilt from my hands and took the patches with her as well, then ran out the door. I sat stunned inside the crafts shed for a moment, wondering what had just happened. I felt really bad for tearing apart her quilt.

The summer finished out without an issue. I'd had an amazing time. Spending time with the kids gave me an appreciation and a passion to work in a school (and lord knows, you need passion to do this job). But I always wondered what happened to Mrs. Collins.

This morning, I finally found out. On the front page of the paper was the name of the old camp, and Mrs. Collins's picture. I had to re-read the article several times to fully understand it.

Camp owner abducts children.

Bodies of children found skinned alive.

Collins, an award-winning quilter, used the skins to stuff her quilts.

...casts a shadow over next week's upcoming quilting competition. 




 I thought you'd be too [drunk](http://www.reddit.com/r/drunknosleep) to remember. 




 They're always there. You just don't have to look at them in the dark. 




 When I was about 6 years old, my parents bought me a nightlight. They thought that it might help with the dreams that had driven me from my bed and into their room every night.

When I woke up from my nightmare, I could see the shapes illuminated around me. The way the arc of electricity jumped around the element gave it all the impression of swaying in the breeze. It wasn't the place I'd fallen asleep, it was a strange reflection of it. 

With the covers tucked tightly beneath my chin, I was sweltering hot. The wrinkled face of the man at the foot of my bed stared on with empty eyes. If I moved, he would see me. If I left the safety of my blanket, he would take me. I shivered with fear and with the strain of pulling the sheets.

Slowly the face shrank down beneath the edge of my mattress and out of sight. I could hear his rough clothes rustling as he slithered his way beneath my bed, pulling himself along with sharp, stained fingernails.

I leapt from bed, bounding outside his reach. In the dim flickering light I saw him there, licking his lips with a long black pointed tongue.

I reached out my hand and switched off the light. Then in the darkness, I crawled back into bed.

Creepy and well-written. Shame on you, sir. :P 




 My cousin Larry and I are from Oregon. Going to the beach is a bit of a production there. It isn't what the typical person pictures in their mind when they think of the word "beach." There's sand and water, but the similarities stop there. You can rarely see the sun through the thick fog, and instead of a bikini, you're more likely to find yourself wearing cold weather gear.

But Larry wanted to learn to surf, so I rented a wetsuit and strapped a board on top of my car. I'm sure I looked ridiculous driving there.

He struggled into the stretchy neoprene. It caused his arms to stick out at his sides a little like a doll. He looked so ridiculous. He started running toward the water.

"Hey Lar! Forgetting something?" I said, pointing toward the surfboard still strapped to my car.

He looked ridiculous, heading to the water holding a board that was twice as long as he was tall. I stopped him for a photo. "Say, 'Hang loose, brah!'"

"Hang loose bra!" He giggled, and held up some unrelated gang sign. I took the picture.

His smile faded, and he howled as his suit filled with the frigid water. It took him a long time to paddle the big board into the breakers. I could see him getting tired right away. I doubted he was having fun anymore now that he knew how much work this was going to be.

When I saw a larger swell pushing up and rising over his small shape, I tried to yell to him. The riptides had been pushing him closer and closer to the rocky jetty. His board raised above him, overbalanced and toppled him. I saw the board, but I couldn't find him in the frothy wave.

I waited a full minute. It felt like forever. Then I was scrambling up the rocks and out along the jetty. I just had to find him. Barnacles cut into my fingertips and salt water sprayed across my back. I was roughly to where I'd seen him. The white board was all the way to the beach already, floating with the fin in the air like a beached animal.

I still couldn't see him or anything else under the dark water. The waves slapped against the rocks and sent spray flying into the air. Then I heard a scratching coming from underneath me, inside the large rocks. Sure enough, an opening appeared in a lull between waves. I tried to stick my head in and look inside. I saw a foot, and a little white hand.

I dove after him. My clothes, wallet, phone, I didn't care. All that mattered was saving Larry.

He might have weighed a thousand pounds of dead weight. Blood ran freely from his forehead, and his skin was all a sickly blue-tinted white.

I clawed muscles and barnacles from the rocks trying to scurry my way up away from the accursed ocean. Larry's dead weight pitched me off balance and caused me to lose my footing. As I fell back into the ocean and a wave swept us apart, I realized that there were people on top of the jetty, watching.

I screamed to them as I broke the surface. I found Larry again, but just as I reached him, another wave swept us under. I just managed to hold onto his leg this time. I was starting to get tired. My jacket was tangling my arms, and the hiking boots that I wore made it so that I had to kick twice as much to stay afloat. Larry looked dead.

Then my foot touched the sandy bottom. I pushed him forward toward the beach. With my last remaining strength I dragged him out of the water. I was too cold to cry. Too tired to think. I pounded my fists on his chest. People gathered around me. I heard one of them say ridiculously, "That was a gnarly wipe out."

A man in a dirty yellow slicker mumbled "Down with the ship."

"Help me!" I screamed, but no one would come closer. They just watched from the edge of the circle. There was something wrong with their faces. They looked too much like Larry. Their skin was too blue. Too slack and lifeless...

Then someone was screaming and running toward us. An elderly man took in the image of Larry, before wrapping me in strong arms and tearing me away. He forced me to get warm. The circle of others were gone.

It was fifteen minutes before anyone else came to the beach. The man who rescued me stayed with me until the paramedics came. He told me "There was nothing you could have done."

"Nothing I could have done? What about all those other people who just stood there and watched?"

"You don't want to be talking about those others, ma'am," he said, seriously.

The doors of the ambulance closed and I was carried away.

 I bashed the cymbals with both hands as hard as I could. The lights, colors, sounds, movements... being on stage like this was bliss.

And then it was over. 

I hated the time after the show was over. Ben went off to find the girls he'd scouted from the front of the stage - it seemed like lead guitar and vocalists were always in demand. Beth, the bassist always found a party to go to as well. That left me.

After the main attraction, I stayed and packed up my drums. First I dried the beer and sweat and spit from the stained wood shells. Then, using a clean cloth dipped in alcohol, I'd clean the cymbals before stacking them in their moulded plastic vault.

Clean. Polished. Meticulous.

Tonight, however someone else was there with me after the lights came up. A waitress named Rose was mopping a suspicious runny mess off the floor near the stage. I couldn't look away. She was like something from a dream.

I still had more to clean up. Since Ben and Beth had gone, I'd be stuck packing up their equipment too, but for the first time in weeks since we'd been on the road, I didn't care.

"Hey, uh, what time do you get off?" I asked.

She flipped scarlet red hair from her face and took me in with a look of amused surprise. Her smile hinted that I was in. What she said next sealed it.

"Let's get out of here, drummer boy."

I followed her outside, and across the street. I don't know why I wasn't concerned that before long we were sloughing our way through the rain-dampened grass and brush. It was getting thick and hard to move through. She didn't seem to be having a hard time moving. It was like the woods were opening up in front of her.

There was light ahead - a campfire and a clearing. I emerged from the brush, soaked and covered with mud. 

In the center of the clearing was a fire in a stone pit. In front of the fire was Ben, to the one side was Beth, and to the other an empty, flat stone. Something told me that was for me.

The girl from the club turned around. Her red hair now faded to a gray straw-like mound that sat atop a disfigured, toothless face. I turned to run back into the woods, but two more women were emerging from the woods. Even the air seemed to bend in front of them, moving out of their way.

When I woke up this morning in the van, Beth and Ben didn't seem to remember anything that had happened the night before. The only proof I had that anything had happened, was an unread text from an unknown number ("Call me any time, Drummer Boy.") and a picture of three stones in a row.

 *"Where do you think it began, the idea that light could keep the monsters away? If anything, the darkness is your friend. The darkness will hide you. It's the light that will betray your secrets and sell you to the things in the shadows."

-Wayne K. Knowlton, 1890

When I was a kid, about 6 years old, my parents bought me a night light. They thought that it might help with the nightmares that had driven me out of my bed and into their room every night. My mother had found it second-hand at an estate sale. It was superman, except his red and blue costume was half chipped away, leaving bare white plastic underneath. He looked sick, and the anemic flickering light that glowed behind him just added to the feeling.

I woke up from my nightmare - not a night terror or sleep paralysis. Just a kid's nightmare that left him nervous and excited and imaginative. This time, I could see the shapes illuminated in my room. The way the arc of electricity jumped around the element gave everything the impression of swaying in the breeze. My room was transformed. It wasn't the place I'd fallen asleep, it was a perverse reflection of it. 

With the covers tucked tightly beneath my chin, I was sweltering hot. The wrinkled face of the man at the foot of my bed stared with empty eyes. If I moved, he would see me. If I left the safety of my blanket, he would grab my foot. I shivered with fear and with the strain of pulling on the blankets.

Slowly the face shrank down beneath the edge of my mattress and out of sight. I could hear his rough clothes rustling as he slithered his way beneath my bed, pulling himself along with sharp, stained fingernails.

I sprung from beneath the sheets and flew through the air, then landed on a stray toy in the middle of my floor. My ankle rolled, and spilled me onto the carpet. If I'd looked under the bed, I'd have seen him, licking his lips with a long, black pointed tongue.

Instead I reached out my hand and switched off the superman light. Then in the darkness, I crawled back into bed.

It was coming.

Outside, the sirens were howling their crescendos. Bill, my youngest, hadn't even been alive the last time it had happened. He was crouched in the corner of the concrete basement. A split had opened up in his jeans over one of the knees, and his hair hung long and unwashed. He pressed his palms over his ears and squeezed his eyes tightly shut.

How do you deal with something like this at six years old? It was hard enough for me at forty. And harder to still to know that I'd failed. Failed to get to shelter, to keep us safe, to keep us *alive*.

"Daddy, what are we doing here? We need to go home!" Sara, my oldest at ten, was tugging at my coat, trying to coax me back outside.

"We can't go back home, Sara. We're just going to wait it out here."

"But... look! Won't it come in through the windows? This doesn't look like a very good place..."

I scooped up Bill from the corner. I could feel his thin body shaking in my arms as he sniffled through tears.

"Well, we'll just make it better, okay? We've still got time."

The abandoned cellar didn't have much inside. It looked like construction of the house above had been given up on. Some bags of cement, old, gray 2x4's and nails were about it. It wouldn't feed us, but we might just make it through the first day if we could board it up tight enough.

I set Bill and Sara to work on the door. Hammering the boards would at least take their minds off of what was happening. I went to work on the narrow windows. The sirens had stopped. It was close now.

The boards went up more easily than I'd thought they would, and in only a couple of minutes, the three windows were boarded over. I brought my flashlight's beam back from the other end of the basement, and found them at the door, working together. The boards were nailed haphazardly to the center of the door. Huge gaps remained, big enough to fit my arm through. I'd have to tear them all down and start over.

But as I approached the door, hammer in hand, the first rays of sun cleared the horizon, and made their way between the scraps of wood. Bill shouted in pain, and my leg burned, dropping me to my knees. We were out of time.

The dawn was here.

But *what if it* **was** *true?*

Sure, you might not think it now. After all, you're reading the stories on your phone in a bathroom stall in the middle of the day.

But then tonight you'll make a late-night run to the grocery store to pick up some cheap wine and ice cream. Heading to your car, keys jangling, patting your pockets (keys, phone, wallet), you think you might hear shuffling footsteps, though no one else is around. As you go to pull out of your parking stall, you think for a split second that the lumpy shape of your gym bag in your rear-view mirror is the misshapen form of a killer, waiting to pounce.

Your mind's just playing tricks on you. You're jumpy. Maybe the wine will help.

You arrive at the store, and start making your way to the frozen food section, but before you make it there, you see a group of people standing clustered together in one of the aisles. It's right in front of the eggs. You can't see them anymore, but you're subtly reminded of a story you read that involved broken eggs. Now you're curious. What happened down the egg aisle? Was one of the huddled people starting to bend down to the floor? Did they notice you? Do you dare go back and investigate more closely?

The story was silly. Wasn't it? But... the people in the comments didn't seem to think so. Actually, you don't know quite enough about feline-human brain transplants to say whether they're plausible or not...

So as you pick out your frozen deliciousness, and head toward the wine section, you notice that your heart's beating little faster. You're a little more awake. Maybe you're noticing more than you would on a normal night because wasn't that story at least plausible? Plausible enough to pretend while you're alone at night that it was true? 









 I was having some trouble at college. You always hear story about how the roommate of the girl who commits suicide automatically gets straight A's. That's about all you ever hear about that girl, the one who walks in and finds the other one that way.

Being back home feels weird, but at first I didn't care. I just wanted to sleep in my own bed and stay in the dark away from everyone. For days.

Almost nothing changed at home since I left. The house was exactly the same. In fact, the only change was that mom didn't do her own vacuuming every day now, since she bought one of those stupid "Roomba" things from a Skymall magazine.

I slept most of the day and night. My parents worried about me. They brought me food and offered to take me places, but I always said no - the most I could manage was to read a few posts on Reddit while avoiding Facebook and the torrent of memorials from her recently acquired array of "best friends" there - before rolling over and falling back into a warm, dreamless sleep.

The police came to question me again. I took a shower for the first time in recent memory and faced the off-colored light of the day. My glasses were off and music was playing in my room. As I walked down the hall from the bathroom to my bedroom, I stepped onto something. It was *alive*. I squealed and retreated into my room, the creature hissed and squirmed off down the hall. I still don't understand why they bought a white Roomba for cleaning their white carpet.

The police said that there was new information, and asked me a bunch of weird questions about the room we shared and the rest of the dorm building. They kept asking if we knew of anyone who kept animals in the dorms, especially something like a snake or anything that laid eggs. I started to feel lightheaded and like the world was too bright for me.

I just got back to bed before I started hyperventilating. I'm exhausted. It sounds lame, I know - I was up for all of three hours. Now that I'm in bed, I'm being kept up by the hissing, whirring sound of the Roomba. It's trapped in my room, and I'm too lazy to get up and open the door.

The other thing that's keeping me awake is the strange way that Lucy was acting in the week before she died. She never was one to go out all the time, but that last week, she kept the curtains drawn and I don't think she ever left the room. Maybe there was something else wrong with her, like she was poisoned or...

 From Pierce the Veil's [Currents Convulsive](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/piercetheveil/currentsconvulsive.html), +/- a word. 









 Hi, /r/cryosleep.

My name is Alex, and I have a quirk. It's not-so-much a weird thing that I do, but more of a weird way that I am. Like a compulsion. I can't start something and then not finish it.

Now, I imagine that most of you are thinking *Gee, that doesn't sound so bad, Alex. I wish I could finish that pile of abandoned projects that I've built up over the years.* And normally, I'd agree with you. My quirk has gotten me a lot of things from numerous academic degrees to excelling in a career. It was my quirk that won me the girl of my dreams. 

It's carried me far, but it also sometimes gets me into trouble. Once, on a visit to Texas, I entered one of those "finish it and eat for free" contests, and nearly ruptured something unpronounceable. I had to change schools in 8th grade when I started a feud with a teacher that ended up in an elaborate set of plans to have her fired. Another time my parents walked in on me jerking off in my bedroom and despite making eye contact for a brief moment with both of them-

Come on, that joke was just too easy not to take.

So this is one of those times.

The idea started when I went to see Back to the Future in theaters. Among all the other lovable nonsense, there's a device called the "Flux Capacitor," a small machine that sits inside the DeLorean is basically responsible for moving the whole assembly through time. The Hollywood prop became the seed of idea that rattled around in my head for years.

When I was eventually assigned to the government's 4th-Dimension Research Wing, it was the idea of a small device which emitted a field around the user, that finally resulted in a break-through.

Let me back up. The 4-DRW is a joke. I mean "joke" in the sense that it does actually exist, but only with the purpose of continuing to exist. Its nuclear power core runs on the same sort of fuel that powers the careers of Reality TV stars. Researchers realized a long time ago that achieving time travel was far more complicated than they could hope to puzzle together and package into a useful tool. The "controlled" black hole had to be the worst failure that they had, but even that had the feeling that precedes the statement "At least we're trying."

Rather than cut funding, however, Uncle Sam got the right kind of confused and excited, and ultimately gave them a blank check. This is why the wing still exists. The goal changed from actually trying to produce time travel to selling the wing to the higher-ups. By the time I got in, it was basically an advertising firm with a couple of guys mixing vinegar and baking soda.

I'd imagine that it's the reason that they recruited me. In order to get the Film History degree I wanted, I had to take a bunch of basic science and math classes. I couldn't stand to have the loose ends like that, so after several years and piles of debt, I actually look like a scientist on paper, when really I just wanted to make movie props. I had a few bad but finished films by the time I graduated, and the guys on the "marketing" side of the 4-DRW saw them, found out about me, and brought me into the organization. They'd help pay off my crushing debt, as long as every quarter, I helped them make a convincing show for their bosses.

By now it should be easy to see that it was a complete and total accident that my device worked.

It was tradition to let the new member design the experiment. Remember, the point wasn't to do anything, just to create the appearance of doing things. I tried to start small, with near-light speed particle collision, but they told me that it had been done a few times before and that "If we spend like we're on a budget, they'll give us one."

So I basically decided to challenge the engineers. With Doc's Flux Capacitor in mind, I wrote the request for them to pack as much stored, chemical energy as they could into something you could put in your backpack, and then to harness it all at once into an arc of electricity through the air, all while managing not to start a fire or explode. Even though I was drunk as I wrote it, I specifically remember putting in big, red letters, "MUST NOT EXPLODE." And as long as I put my units and dimensions in the right place, our engineers were required to create it. The next week, a sleek-looking 3D-printed box was sitting in the middle of blast chamber Sierra's brushed titanium floor. It didn't look anything like Doc's, but hey, it was a prototype.

We all thought the thing was just going to blow up as soon as it was activated. At least we were going to get a good, bright explosion shot to show the bosses. Sierra is one of our medium sized spherical blast chambers, at just over a half-mile circumference. We set some modified exercise equipment in next to the box in order to show how people would eventually be able to use it to travel through time.

With the cameras and lights in place, we began. When the big red button was pressed, the box started to hum and vibrate. Something inside was spinning. it went on for a few minutes like that, with nothing happening, other than it making this weird noise that kept getting louder and louder. We could hear it through the blast shield, and that thing is thick.

Then, boom. Blue light filled the chrome chamber for a split second, and the sound was gone. The device and most of the workout equipment appeared to be gone as well. Right in the middle of the blast floor was a half-sphere carved right through the titanium, down into the lead. Like someone had taken a giant melon baller to it.

The bottom of the crater was filled with gray powder. The best I can figure is that it's like in the Terminator, where it makes a field around the person, only that field isn't like a perfect bubble, it's more like a wifi hotspot that gets less signal the further away you are from it. Right next to the device, almost everything moves. Around the edges, it's impossible to say when you'll end up, or you might end up only half-transported, leaving a thin reddish powder.

Tomorrow marks Trial 16. We've come a long way since that time. 15.3 had just a few bugs to work out, and only now I'm having thoughts of what it might mean if tomorrow Time Travel becomes a reality... and it's all my fault.

Help me, cryosleep. I can't stop.

Zooey was such a nice girl in the beginning. You'd always see her, head down, hair messy, rushing to her next class and avoiding the other kids in the hall. Xenial, always, but just a little too shy, maybe a little too strange to really fit in. When her mother died after their house caught fire, Zooey took it hard, and it pushed her into a dark place.

Valentine's Day, 1998 was when she had her first "outburst." Unsettling still, is the way she stood over the other me and smiled. There I'd been, taking out my frustration of the day out on her, saying the meanest things that my kid-brain could think to say about her drunk mother and then *boom*, Zooey hit me hard and fast with a power outside herself. Stranger still, was the way that my wound never quite fully healed. Right in that soft spot where my jawbone meets my neck, an angry red mark festered from that day on.

Quietly, Zooey was removed from the school, and digested into the bureaucratic system of foster care. People eventually forgot that she'd ever been there. 

One early morning, dew still soaking the lawns of the school, I saw someone standing outside the window. Normally, I'm not sure I would have noticed, except that they were waving their hands in a series of intricate dives and swoops. My eyes squinted against the rising sun, I could just barely see a pair of large spectacles glinting under a dark hood. Lazily, my brain worked to find an explanation. Keeping my eyes on their fluid motion, I raised my own hand. Just as the teacher called my name, the waving stopped.

I held my breath.

Hazy red points of light were now floating from their outstretched hands. Glowing, they revealed the visage of little Zooey beneath the cowl. Face pulled down in a grimace, she shoved the lights toward the building. Each of them grew as they went, sputtering into bitter hot flame. 

Dissonant ringing pealed from the fire alarms, and the flames tore through the halls in an instant. Cries of the children consumed in the inferno still haunt me on quiet nights. Before that day, I'd never understood why my scar looked like a burn. 

All I can think of now is the look in her eyes as she stood and watched, how a smile crept into the corners of her lips, and how it went away when she saw me alive. 




 So most of you have heard of /r/nosleep, a place for (mostly) short scary stories where the readers are not allowed to dispute how true they are. *Everything is true.*

There is a relatively new sub, called /r/cryosleep, started by a few of nosleep's mods with similar rules, but set in the future. This opens up a lot of new, fun opportunities for stories. *Everything is going to be true.*

**The Prompt:**

What is the future going to look like? Write it in a way that would be fun to share with a community that will pretend that it is, or is going to be, true.

 The first creature that I saw in this place... I never saw at all. 

It was before I'd found a light. The only way that I knew that it was there was by the sound of its breathing, stirring the emptiness.

I was naive. Inexperience in this endless cavern told me that the rules still applied. That an empty room in the dark was still empty.

"Hello?" I called, and my voice echoed back. Still, there was something there. I could hear the faint ticking raspiness of air moving through its open mouth.

At this time, I was still standing. Foolishly, I stretched my hand toward where I'd heard the noise. My feet carried me half-heartedly. Left foot forward, then the right one coming up to join it.

It must have been close. I could hear its breath with perfect clarity now, deep and huge. I could feel the cool air against my sides, pulling me toward it; smell the scent of decay on its warm breath. Each time it inhaled, there was a whirring, ticking sound like tiny ratcheting gears being wound.

It was my nose that betrayed me. The dead-smelling exhaust tickled my nostrils and brought tears to my eyes. I sneezed, and loudly. Before the echo even made its way back to my ear, a huge metallic clang tore the silence from the air. It felt at the time as though my sneeze had broken the world.

Behemoth footfalls, ringing one after the other, washed around the endless space. My ears split and popped from the noise. My hands, uncommanded, clawed into my ears, trying to pull the painful noise from them, but only managed to dull the edge a little.

Then it was gone. Wet drops poured from my ears as I lay in a pile on the smooth, cool stone.

---

The second creature that I saw in this place... wasn't a creature at all, it seemed.

A few days had passed - be it two or twelve, I couldn't say. My ears were still just useless pieces of flesh. Somewhere in the darkness, I'd found a light. It was a plastic cannister, about the size of a pop can. As it was shaken, a steel marble worked the fluid inside, and it glowed. One sense gone, one gained.

The cave was endless. The enormity of it truly set in once I could see it with my eyes. The dim, green glow showed only the hints of a high ceiling, and a long, flat, seamless floor as smooth as glass. Every hundred yards there sat a large support pillar, of concrete with bars and rods that jutted out at random.

It was near one of these that my lamp shone upon another person; the first person I'd known to share my prison. My mouth moved, and I felt myself call out, but only cold, oppressive silence met my ears. I walked closer still, nearly able to touch her with my outstretched hand. It was a woman. She seemed old and thin, wearing a faded red dress. Facing away from me and toward the pillar, her face was hidden behind thin black hair.

Then, my gaze fell upon her feet. They writhed and moved strangely under the shadow of her dress. I thought that it might have been some type of animal, a bug, a spider. Green light fell upon the truth, that her toes were shaped like long fingers with joints that were swollen and bent by arthritis. They milled and moved, groping and pulling at that faultless floor.

Her feet had turned her to face me. Dark, wrinkled skin sagged beneath cloudy eyes and from her neck. Her bones still glowed with former beauty, but age and this place had sapped her of her youth and its sweet goodness.

Her arms and legs were somehow switched at the shoulders and hips. She stared into me with those blank, wet and blind eyes. Or perhaps she heard my heart pounding, or my heavy breathing. I stepped away, and she bent forward, placing her hands (feet?) on the ground. Her gaze never left me. She started to walk, and those long, irregular hands came around her sides.

From somewhere in the folds of her dress, she pulled a small bag. I was backing away, but she was pursuing me, getting closer and closer. Her mouth was working, her lips twisting into words that I could no longer hear.

Two long fingers probed into the bag. Her feet slapped the floor rapidly, and she was upon me. Just before I could turn to run in earnest, she tossed a pinch of swirling dust into the air.

My lungs burned. I couldn't inhale - the very air had turned to fire. I couldn't run, I could only cough and spit and crawl. My face felt as though the skin had been removed and some gnarled hand tugged at the exposed nerves with every beat of my heart. Panicked, I couldn't force my eyes open to know where the harpy had gone.

The air gradually cleared. With painful sloth it came back to me in gulps. I lost consciousness, choked, and woke only to black out again. My body knew that I was about to die while my mind knew only fear and agony.

---

Broken, and burnt I lay, and resolved to explore the darkness no further. For what felt like weeks, I kept the chemicals inside the lamp glowing, keeping the shadows and what was in them at bay like a child's night light. Shaking its marble and liquid to recharge it. 

An internal debate raged within my wheezing chest: to let them claim me as I lay, or to try to preserve myself until the time that one large and hungry enough came for me. The light began to fade.

I laid on my back, and prayed for sleep. One cracked eyelid showed pale shapes moving, circling closer, just beyond where my lantern shone.  When the reaction inside it finally stilled, I felt sure that I would go, taken away on hundreds and thousands of pale, thin limbs by creatures that God knew better than to create.

Instead, it was... peaceful.

The only thing that moved was the fluttering of my heart. My fear ebbed like the tide until it crashed back down on my in a wave. A sensation of tingling crawled over my body. My eyes snapped open and I felt for the lamp. A jolt like a lightning bolt shot up my spine. I scrambled to my feet, and felt blindly for the light.

Another electric shock, like static discharged, but prolonged for several seconds jolted through my hand as it felt along the floor and my bare feet. My knees faltered, and my knees bore the pain too. My limbs moved on their own, and an errant hand or foot - I couldn't say which - struck the lamp and sent it glowing, spinning along the bare floor. I gripped it, rattled it, and held it up to show my attacker.

There was nothing and no one, and yet again a wave of torture came. Each time I pulled a pained limb away, another part of me was sacrificed in its stead. I shed my thin clothes and stood on them, but it brought no relief. Next, I ran. The shocks became stronger, making their way up, boiling my blood and out arcing out through my panting mouth head and twitching arms. The floor itself was *made* of electricity, it seemed, and there was no escape.

As I ran, scrambled, wrestled, screamed, a thought pushed its way into my brain. A memory from before of a lab rat that said "You never, ever get used to" the feeling of electric shock. I could only hope that someone would turn it off, but soon, even hope was replaced with pain.

It took a very long time. Between exhaustion and shock, I suddenly felt sure that I was passing from life. And then, the pain was gone.

It was bliss.

I collapsed against the base of one of the pillars, and smiled. Tears of joy streamed from my eyes, and down onto my naked chest. I tried to rub my tired, numb legs, but my hands never came. I examined my hands under the lantern, and watched as it struck my thigh, my chest, then my face.

I felt nothing, not the pain of the floor, or the tears on my face.

---

I walked, mute, deaf and numb, straight ahead into the blackness. My relief at the subsidence of the pain had worn itself out, and I felt as empty inside as I did on the surface. I walked for miles. It was all I could do. In the dim green light of my lantern, I could see my bare feet as they carried me forward by dumb reflex.

I had no feeling in my legs, or anywhere. It was hard to keep my balance. Even as stumbled and fell, I had to rely on my eyes to tell me which way was up; had to watch my hand to know that it was placed on the ground, pushing me up. The light faded. Either it was growing weaker or I was losing interest in shaking it. What point was there? Each new darkness I wandered into would surely be the same as the last. Eventually, lights began to flicker in front of my eyes and I was seeing stars. 

But then, one of the stars far in the distance shone more brightly and illuminated several of the steel and stone pillars. Lights. They weren't sensory misfires, there was something ahead. My pace, the march of a doomed man, quickened to a jog. The lights continued to fly high in the cavern, resembling flares or fireworks. I thought of the times that we'd bought roman candles during the summer holidays. My eyes strained to see anything below them, in the area lit by their brief glow. My breath quickened at the thought of seeing another person's face illuminated in the distance.

In the corner of my eye, I took in that one of the pillars was beginning to move. Something huge had knocked into it, and sent stone and scraps of metal flying in a cloud of dust and debris. I changed course too late, and a fragment of rock as large as a mattress swiped my left side.

Dust cloyed the flashing, flying lights above and just a short ways ahead. I rolled my body to allow myself to see what was happening. I could just see objects moving through the clouds. Hundreds of snakelike creatures writhed in a ball. Each one was several feet around. Beneath the ball, I could see four appendages, and realized that the snakes were in fact connected as one creature, towering fifty feet or more in the air. It was making its way closer to me, its massive weight evident in the slow movement of its legs.

Some of the beast's appendages were longer and more slender, tipped with white lights that winked on and off, but all of its many arms were being flung about in wild anger. Just as I stood and turned to run, my eye was drawn to a dark spot on the pillar behind the beast. A doorway.

It smashed into another pillar, this one very near me. My ankle was bent at an odd angle, and I could see my breath stirring the dust in front of me, but I felt no pain, only a wrong-ness like one feels when walking with one foot on a curb and the other in a street. I hobbled my way toward the next pillar, hoping to take refuge behind it.

I went as fast as I could, but I was sure that the naked, slimy, white arms of the thing was right behind me. If I ventured a look back over my shoulder, I might lose my balance, and then the thing would be on top of me.

I reached the next pillar, and hugged onto the corner, trying to conceal myself behind it. Looking back, I saw that the monster had stopped, and no longer pursued me. Up out of the center, in the top, parting the knotted tentacles like a bee leaving a rose, a larger appendage rose up. This one was jet black, and opened at the end, revealing long, needle-sharp teeth dripping with liquid.

it snaked down across the floor, toward a small speck of something green near where I'd fallen; my lantern. The only other source of light, drowned out by the beast's strobing stadium lights. The large snakelike mouth struck the ground around it, and its sharp teeth sank deep into the stone floor. The other tentacles braced against the floor while the great, black neck strained and stretched, but it was the floor that gave first, letting up a large, round plug of stone, which was promptly swallowed. The black head of the thing retreated back into the center of the tangle of other tentacles, their waving movements having calmed into a gentle swaying again.

I wanted so badly to run away, but one thing held me in place. The doorway. It seemed like it was hardly possible that after all this time, that I could have finally found a way out, and yet in my mind there was no where else to go. I had to try.

The beast made its way back in front of the pillar with the door, apparently standing guard. I made a large circle and came up behind the huge pillar. It was identical to all the others, a mish-mosh of metal scraps, jagged rocks and cement nearly fifty feet across at the base, but knowing the beast, and possibly a way out was just on the other side made this one seem much smaller.

I crawled around the edge, and the things swirling tentacles came into view, reaching up toward the faraway ceiling, the longer ones tipped with those blinding white lights. I stayed low and hugged the side of the wall, just hoping that the beast could only see light, and that I could stay hidden in the darkness for long enough.

I was halfway around the side of the pillar, and was still alive. The doorway was just another fifty feet ahead in the center of the side facing the monster. I decided to look away, focusing on my hands. Without my other senses, looking away almost made the thing disappear completely. In a few moments, I was at the corner.

Here, I could hide part of my body behind a large disk made of jagged metal which stuck out of the cement wall. I paused for a moment to plan my route forward. I would have to go around the disk, and then scurry twenty five feet along the wall, only ten feet or so from the feet of the guardian. I didn't so much as look back.

I was around the metal barrier, crawling, crawling. Twenty feet. Crawling, I looked away, staring at my right hand which traced the line where the flawless floor met the unfinished cement. I glanced at the door. Fifteen feet. A sickly white limb, with blue veins coursing beneath the slimed translucent skin lazed through my vision. I closed my eyes to stop myself from staring at it. I arched my back, sure that one of the tentacles would smash me like a bug, or those long, transparent fangs would pick me up, without my so much as knowing.

I stopped crawling, and opened my eyes. My right hand was through the doorway, and without knowing it, I had turned myself. I had made it. I glanced one last time at the beast, and saw that its black head was snaking back through the mass of wormy arms again in a smooth, lubricated motion. With my eyes closed, I hadn't noticed that my knee had struck a piece of metal debris, knocked from the tower by the beast earlier. The noise had doomed me.

I stood and ran into the doorway, and found a spiralling set of black stairs lining the walls. My leg gave out, and I dove, face-first into the bottom stair. I frantically clawed up the stairs, toward the orange light coming from above me. I could feel and hear nothing, but I was sure that I was screaming.

The wall above me erupted. Angry appendages entered the stairwell, probing blindly, looking for the intruder. I stopped. From below, the black head, mouth closed snaked in. I was curled into a ball, just below the first landing, next to the wall. Above me, the tentacles, and below me the head. I couldn't move, and I couldn't make a sound. I blacked out before I even realized that I'd been holding my breath.

When I came to, the arms and head of the thing had retreated from the stairwell. I was alone, bathed in the orange glow coming from above. As quietly as I could, I crawled, one step at a time. It must have taken me hours. Finally, I could see the top! An opening in the wall, where an orange, electric glow shone in was just another few landings above me. I crept faster, desperation wriggling its way into my movements.

I don't know what happened, but suddenly I was aware of a vibration and the whole stairway was shaking and vibrating. I cast a glance down over the edge, and saw the flashing lights of the creature, its strong white tentacles pulling it through the hole it had made and at an unfathomable speed up the center of the stairwell. It took up the entire area, wall to wall, and shot up toward me. In the center, I could see that black mouth opened wide.

I ran with my one good leg and my hands in a sort of tripod up the last few flights, and rushed out of the opening, turned to the side and dove out of the way of the beast. In a blur, the white beast, now colored orange by the lights outside shot away from me. Without any hesitation, it stepped on and demolished a 1980's Volkswagen Rabbit, and shot its head up, snatching the glowing bulb from the top of the street lamp. When that one was gone, it continued on down the rain-drenched street, devouring whatever light it could find.

I was free. Oh god.

*It was all real.*

---

These words are wasted. I know.

I've only written them in case some time in the future, another person comes along, so that they'll know what happened. That there was another who survived. I can't explain why the hellish world below this one was suddenly caused to hemorrhage over into ours, where the beasts went once they'd ravaged our great society, or whether they'll be back again.

I can only tell you that I saw the place that they came from.

And it was almost empty. 




 /r/nosleepworkshops has come under new management. If you're a fan of horror and helping writers, check it out! 









 Fosters alarm blared in his ears. He slapped aimlessly at the floor until he finally managed to contact the snooze button. Something wet had soaked the dirty floor and silk lining of Fosters resting place. As he lay sprawled over the edge of his coffin, a drip of groundwater dripped onto the back of his neck.

Gotta fix that leak. he spoke to himself, voice clipped and muted by the small, dirt-walled space. He sighed. Another day. It got harder and harder to wake from the dead with each one that passed.

He thrust a decomposed, rotting hand through the ground above him, into the moonlight. Fumblingly, he pulled at the grassy ground above his grave. It was easier to get a grip on the marble headstone, but to get there, he had to dislocate a shoulder. Each time he did it, the socket became a little more worn. Somewhere along the line, theyd decided to put the marker at the head instead of the feet, and zombies like Foster started their day with a little more of a struggle, as they cursed the well-meaning folks whod buried them.

He shambled toward the front gate of the cemetary, a large, black ornate eyesore of ivy and roses.

Hi George!

Hey Foster. Got plans tonight? Georges mostly skeletal hand held up a bag of green, writhing worms. I got these from a friend in Reedsville.

Without a digestive system, working liver, kidneys or totally intact nervous system, the stimulants that theyd used in life were no longer effective.. The only way to get a buzz was through the use of parasites. The offer was enticing, ut Foster had other plans.

Sorry, I cant. Got a new lead to look into over in Springfield.

Really? Sorry, I mean... Thats great, Foster. I hope you find her. Hey, if it doesnt work out this time, half this bag is yours.

Thats a deal. See you at sunrise.

Foster pushed open the gate which produced a massive shriek from its rusty hinges. He shambled down the main road, then turned left toward Springfield.

***

The first sign to greet a person as they entered Springfield was the one reading NO VACANCY at the 24/7 hotel. It was run by a little blue ghoul with big glasses named Leroy. The hotel wasnt actually full, and hadnt been for more than 120 years, but hed kept the sign working as it doubled as the name of his new business. The undead living out in the cemeteries preferred to do their business with Leroy when they could, rather than go into town. The ghoul carried little everyday things like embalming fluid, bandages and stitches, and caulking (which Foster would need to remember to buy on his way back), but he could get just about anything in a couple of days if you were willing to fill out the order paperwork.

It was Leroy who had given Foster the tip - somebody new recovered from near ground zero claiming that their last name was Ruff.It wasnt a definite match - theyd found others before. In the hundred years since the bomb had dropped, theyd found thousands of dead. Statistically, some were bound to have the name. It didnt stop Fosters steady shambling past NO VACANCY, though.

When they found her, hed be there. Hed finally be able to take his wife home to the grave beside his.

***

Wanna buy some maggots, pal? A zombie with rotting, squirming flesh asked, walking close enough to smell out of a dark alley. Foster shied away, and scowled. Whats his problem? asked the maggot dealer, as Foster shuffled away.

Hed always hated coming into the city, preferring to stay in the secluded country as much as possible. There was only one thing that was in the city that Leroy couldnt get: fresh brains.

Foster pushed through the doors of the busy cafe, and spotted a waitress he knew. Her hands were full of plates and empty bottles, but she nodded her charred skull toward the back table.

Lindsay was an anomaly in Fosters world. Being killed in the nuclear blast of course meant that she was also fully skeletal. All the ones they recovered were now. Freshly out of the rubble, these newly dead were blank slates. The ghouls had taken it upon themselves to reintegrate them. It wasnt always possible.

She was one of the few freshly dead that Foster genuinely had no problems with. She was sweet as ever and worked two jobs to save money for a little plot like the ones in his cemetery. And she always remembered just how Foster liked his brains; bloody and raw, with just a dash of formaldehyde on the edge of the plate.

As soon as she could, she hurried to his table in the furthest corner, carrying a fresh plastic bottle of Johannes   Johanness finest embalming tonic. She set it down and with quick bony fingers, signed the words Single or double, today, Honey?

With his own slow movements he curled his hand to say, Double, thank you. The Recovery Clinic is not open for one hour.

Recovery? That sounds exciting! Your signing is getting better. Her hands moved so fast that the bones clicked against each other. It made a mockery of his own brain dead hands, but he took the compliment anyway.

***

The entrance to the Recovery Clinic was actually an ancient train station, converted in the Twenty-First Century to use with the Subway, and housed enough office space to support the citys day-to-day metro operations. If you were claiming or adopting a corpse, you out-processed them through the station.

The underground tunnels were the only way to get close enough to the heart of the city and ground zero. Ghouls excavated as far in as their immunity would take them, but the fallout would still be too great for the areas closest to the blast site to be unearthed for years to come. The intermediate area housed the clinic itself, where bodies were reassembled and prepared for their assimilation back into society. The underground tunnels were the only way to enter the area with safety from the radiation above.

Foster took a slip of paper with a number, and found one of the empty dilapidated leather seats. Hed always liked the smell of the dust down here. A few other zombies were waiting in the seats with him, a mother with quite a bit of flesh remaining sat, while her children, both newly dead, took turns poking an old sleeping skeleton wrapped head-to-toe in bandages. Each time that they did so, and his old bones began to stir, the pair would run away with a clatter of small bones on the stone tiles.

The car sounded far off down the tunnel and the group took to their feet, including the bandaged skeleton who took a few minutes to adjust his hips into place before standing.

The single-car subway train pulled into the ancient platform a little fast, and bumped into the barricade. The ghouls and zombies standing on board had to take a large step to regain their balance at the sudden stop.

In the conductors seat was a yellowed and decaying member of the undead. The damp tunnels had been unkind to him. A tremor shook his hand and threatened to break the last remaining strings of flesh holding his arm together.

Hey Gory.

Hi-i-i, F-f-foster. B-back ag-g-g-gain?

Hopefully for the last time. Trying not to get my hopes up.

O-o-kay, then. Ho-old on, the b-b-breaks are a little w-worn t-tod-day.

Thanks, Gory. Dont work too hard.

Foster was sure the old corpse hadnt heard him, but took his place in the back anyway. As the train car began to pull away from the station, he wondered how many times hed made this ride now.

***

From start to finish, the tunnel took about five minutes to traverse. At three minutes in, Gory sneezed. He made to wipe the rot and snot from his upper lip, but found that the last tendon had given out, separating his arm at the elbow. He could only manage a choked scream as they sped into the corner without brakes. the ancient wheels finally separated, and the car shot straight through the cement wall, into a parallel tunnel and stopped dead against the solid earth behind it.

Foster unstuck himself from the other corpses in the front of the train car. The bandaged skeletons parts were everywhere. Gory was just a pile of dried meat, ragged clothes and crushed bone. The woman was starting to fuss about, collecting the bones of her children into their separate piles. Foster rubbed a pain in his belly, where he found a small bone had punctured his stomach, letting the brains hed eaten earlier out and staining his suit. The woman snatched to bone from him and went back to her task.

Foster opened the door and stepped onto the gravel floor of the tunnel. There was a light shining in the distance, possibly from above the ground. He pulled his suits collar up over his neck and headed toward the light.

Dont go into the light! the woman called from the train. You could be exposed!

Dont worry. Ill just go see if theres anyone who can help, then Ill come right back.

A short ways down the tunnel he found a ladder built into the wall that led to a circular portal above. Bright light shone down into the tunnel. Hed have to make this quick. 

...Relatively quick.

On the surface, high-powered work lights illuminated the entire area. Foster was blind. He picked a direction at random and began limping.

Blleeuuugh! he moaned. The sensation of being in the bright light was uncomfortable. He put his arms out in front of him, reaching for anything to regain his orientation. Someone screamed.

Get him back in line!

What the-? Hes a zed!

Where the hell did he come from?

Get it the fuck out of here!

Fosters blind stumbling had brought him to the edge of the lit area. He couldnt see what was being lit, but there were people in the darkness all around. Lots of them, all standing still like a wall of silhouettes. Someone pushed him while grabbing his arm tightly. A big ghoul was hurrying him out of the area.

Fosters head spun, nearly falling off. He could still see the line of people with ghouls moving back and forth keeping them in place. Tall buildings rose around them on every side.

Buildings that should have been destroyed a hundred years ago.

***

When the ghouls had finally let Foster go, hed been allowed to go to the Recovery Clinic and check for the remains. Someone had already claimed them. The bones theyd found were a Jeanette Ruff. Fosters wifes name was Alicia.

He didnt get home until well after dawn, but the worry of his skin drying out managed not to bother him. He forgot to buy caulking. George had gone under long ago. 

All that Foster could think of was the line of humans - real, living humans, and the city of buildings theyd always believed to be destroyed.

Mona's heavy armor shuffled softly as she ran. The plates were each muffled by supple pieces of leather sewn between them. It was truly masterfully made, and it occurred to her that she hadn't made a sound yet; hadn't heard a sound yet - the others running beside her through the trees were just as silent.

No one in the group had said a word since leaving the monastery they'd used as shelter. Not one word, and yet they each seemed to know where exactly they were supposed to be. They knew where every other person was supposed to be be as well, in order for the formation to work, and that was what was terrifying to Mona. This was her first mission, her first charge to the field of battle to appease her God, Tempus, and despite all the training and preparations, she was still convinced that the clerics to her right and to her left knew what she should be doing better than she did.

Then they were out of the trees, and there was no more room in her mind for doubt or uncertainty. There was only war all around them. The followers of Tempus had the upper hand against their enemy rolling down the side of the valley deep into the flank of their wearied enemy. The militia force they'd been battling further up the valley had done so well, using their superior knowledge of the twists and turns and secret passageways through the mountains to narrow the gap in their pitifully small numbers and the attacking force's army of thousands.

Pressed down into the relative openness of the valley, however, without the aid of the priests and priestesses, they would scarcely have lasted through the night.

Mona felled one of the attackers before they even saw her coming, by harnessing the added speed from running downhill into a mailed elbow that she drove into the base of a skull. She felt the bones lift away from each other and the muscled soldier collapsed on the ground. Her eyes lingered a second too long on the face of the man, and another screamed and charged her with a nasty barbed spear still dripping with gore.

Mona managed to bring up her shield just in time to deflect the thrust. Her training guided her motions, but she was distracted by the dirty round face that was contorted in rage where her kindly weapons instructor's face should have been. She dodged a wild blow from her opponent's shield, and without needing to look, ducked low enough for the spear to come back over her. Once it had cleared, she sprung from her low position, pressing with all her considerable strength driving the spear far out to the side. Her opponent's flank was open, and she plunged her sword through the gap in his armor, between the ribs and into his heart and lungs.

The maneuver had shifted her battle helmet uncomfortably. Another soldier had targeted her from a few feet away, however, and there wasn't time to adjust. She flipped it off with the back of her hand, and confidently strode toward her attacker.

The din of battle took on a different sound as arrows fell in a blanket across the battlefield, fired from enemy archers hidden in the shadows of the trees. Mona's attacker had taken one in the lower back, the sheer pain of it, drove him to his knees. A second later, her face burned as another whizzed by close enough for the stiff feathers to open a cut across her cheek. She brought her shield up, to account for the gap in her armor. She'd never taken her eyes off the man, still on his knees, clawing desperately to free the arrow from his back, but his armor's inflexibility wouldn't allow him the relief. A slash across his throat ended his agony.

To her left, the militia forces were regrouping, the attention taken off of them, and placed onto the greater threat. Back up the hill where she'd come, five points of yellow light were hovering in the hands of the priests, before being thrown onto the holy warriors below. One found their way to Mona, the small sphere growing to surround her. Another volley of arrows launched and stopped dead at the edge of the magical barrier. The ground forces were broken, it was only a matter of sweeping up that was left. Some of her brethren charged into the forest on the opposite bank, toward the unarmored archers. All told, the slaughter was over in minutes.

Mona looked over the faces of the men and women fallen in battle. Tempus would be pleased at their performance; few of their brothers and sisters were among those on the bloody ground. She set about healing the members of the militia who still clung to life, and finishing off those from the invading army. Mona fetched a magical amulet from around her neck and rubbed it with the thumb of her left hand. It started to glow and pull against its chain. She could still only perform minor healing spells, but the amulet's magic would aid her in bringing relief to those with more serious wounds.

Laney had hoped that she was finished crying. Past all that.

*You're a grown-up now,* her mother had told her. That was a full year ago, but this night, for the first time, she might have felt like one. Laney studied her appearance in the full-length mirror once again. Her mother's gardening cloak hung around her shoulders, still a bit too large. Its silvery seams glimmered with enchantments, the pinnacles of the stitching ended elegantly in rosebuds. Another rose, this one black, adorned the band in her stark white hair.

She looked ready for anything. Almost.

She skipped back to fetch a sword from the bed. With its belt slung over her shoulder, the jade scabbard dragged and rattled on the rough-hewn wooden floor.

---

Standing at the gate, Laney traced the intricate patterns of the wrought-iron with a finger. She'd walked by a thousand times before, never paying any mind to them. Roses, for their beauty. And thorns to keep children out of the cemetery beyond. Laney wasn't a child any longer.

There was no lock to be seen, but she felt something in her chest tugging her forward. She touched the delicate, silver-inlaid hilt to the center of the gate, and the black vines around it came to life, spiraling outward from the center. The silver in her sword and robe began to glow, the ancient magic of the strange town yawning to life.

Inside the gates, soft sounds could be heard in the darkness. Dragging. The smell of fresh, wet dirt, and another - deeper and muskier - of decay.

Laney lowered herself to one knee to light a lamp from her pack. Focusing on the wick, she didn't see the dark shapes moving in the soft light of the match. She held the lamp high. Higher, higher. It was plucked from her gloved hand. All around her, green stalks twisted and writhed around her, their thorns just grazing her robe. The silver glowed brightly in resistance. Her lips pressed into a thin smile.

She gripped the glowing hilt tightly in her left hand, and pulled the green steel blade clear of its scabbard. The roses around her hissed their distaste like great serpents.

With dexterous grace, she mowed them down as fast as they came.

[The Ghost Thief](http://www.kimsokol.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/GhostThief.jpg) by [Kim Sokol](http://kimsokol.tumblr.com/)

---

The girl opened her pack and extracted a fat green bottle wrapped in fur. It was one she'd used several times before for this exact dark purpose. The crumbling cork slid loosely out of the opening. She crouched next to the lifeless body at her feet, her tight leather armor creaking softly as she moved. With a muffled word and a mysterious swish of her hand, the air in front of her glowed softly, then faded.

With a frustrated swear, she repeated the charm. The light glowed a little brighter this time and Jarod, standing in the shadows, thought that he could just see the outline of a tortured face being framed in the glow. This spell faded as well, and the girl swore louder. Jarod couldn't see why the blonde thief would even bother. This area had hosted several wars throughout the years and remains were plentiful; one only needed to look around the cave that they were in to know that. Wasting an enchanted bottle to capture this spirit wouldn't bring her any fortune, especially from here. No, this was something else.

On the third try, the thief's spell illuminated a satisfied smile on her face and caused Jarod to slink behind a pile of bones. The face, glowing in the darkness, was stretched and almost as thin as the skulls lining the walls. She began to reel the spirit into the bottle with one waving hand. Obviously clumsy with magic, her brow pinched in concentration. Jarod thought how easy it would be to incapacitate the girl right now. He had cause; the body she knelt over had belonged to his mentor, a silver-robed mage that had earned some renown in a long-ago age. Therein lied the reason that Jarod stayed his attack. The apprentice felt that he had long ago gleaned all he could from the old man with his strict code and laws, and finding him dead at a cutpurse's hand lifted his spirits.

Her work was complete. She carefully wrapped the glowing bottle and set it into her bag with the rest of her collection, considered the cavern around her and set out, her new shadow creeping along the tunnels behind her.

The town of Zale, where Jarod and his master had come was due east. The girl struck a path to the south through the woods. He admired how at home she seemed to be, even as she avoided the main paths. Early on, he had summoned a sphere of silence around himself so that the girl wouldn't hear him breaking branches and twigs. Her own magic seemed to be grounded in her skill and dexterity; he hadn't heard her once. For reasons he couldn't fully explain, he was captivated by the girl; her beauty seemed to grow with each obstacle she overcame.

He began to feel the length of the trek taking its toll. Briars and branches had claimed the hem of his robe, and his cloth shoes, once cobalt blue were now brown and caked with mud. His mark emerged from the trees onto a wide dirt road. Her pace had never slowed in the brush, but now she clipped along even faster.

The road ended in a wide, flat valley that housed a community of small farms. In the center of the valley, a group of huddled buildings stood above than the rest. The sun was setting on the hills framing the village. Against its glow, the girl's silhouette disappeared into one of the buildings. That was fine by Jarod.

For twelve years the young mage had studied under his old master. Creatures, places, artifacts, scrolls, tomes... It had been an endless cycle, a tedious life. He intended to study the girl in her own environment, untainted by his observation, as he would have studied a Pixie or a Bogg Toad. He wasn't in search of companionship; he only wanted to know her, while enjoying the power that anonymity afforded him. That power swirled and mixed with the feeling of freedom inflating in his chest as he found his way to the cluster of buildings.

The only building with light and activity coming from within it was an inn that doubled as a tavern and a small trading post. A squat, mustached man frowned at Jarod's undeniably impractical and dirty clothes from behind a wooden counter. In the next room was a tavern where hardy farmers were gathered around handmade tables where they were loudly sharing cups and tales.

Jarod's hand made a subtle movement and the mustached man's frown became dulled and the light left his eyes. "I'll be needing a room and clothes. You don't need to know my name or my business, only that I wish to be left alone." He set a pile of coins on the wooden countertop. "I am quite sure that this will be sufficient to cover my stay. My key, please."

---

A short time later, Jarod descended the stairs wearing black pants and boots with a forest green traveling cloak. The noise from the small pub rose up the steps to greet him. Ignoring the man at the counter, he grabbed the handle of the door to leave. Jarod released the handle and his hand slowly dropped to his side. He turned his focus back to the bar. Standing there, next to a group of men at the table, was the one he'd been following. He walked into the bar and pulled out an empty chair at one of the tables - the only empty chair in the room. The strangers stared at him for a moment, but Jarod's gaze was fixed on the girl as she went from table to table, laughing and joking with the men she obviously knew. Her dexterity and finesse were obvious here as well, and her beauty more so. Two of the others at Jarod's table went back to their stories. The third tapped him on the shoulder with enough force to .

In normal circumstances, the mage would have resented the uncalled for touch, but the discomfort of his clothes was a constant reminder that he was in disguise. He swallowed his discomfort and looked toward the man. A thick beard was soaked with mead, and he smelled like dirt and sweat. "She's somethin' huh?"

"Something... Yes. Do you know her?"

"Sure do. That's the girl I'm gonna marry."

"You are her betrothed?"

"Well... no. She doesn't actually know me jus' yet. Gotta work up a little courage is all."

"You've never actually met her, then?"

"Oh, I met 'er. She... might not 'a got my name right..."

"I see."

"She's such a cute li'l thing. Her family's got a farm back toward the red hill." The young man tried to focus through his inebriation in order to take in Jarod's appearance. Before he could finish, the girl had appeared beside the table.

"Hi, Bill. Mort." She nodded to the old men at the table. "Another drink for both of you?" Both nodded and went back to their conversation. "And you two... well, hello. I don't believe I've seen you here before" she said, looking at Jarod. "Brothers?" Jarod glanced at the other man ogling the girl. Thick arms and shoulders flanked a barrel-chest with a wild blond beard hanging over it. The two could not have been more dissimilar.

"Ah, no. Afraid not. I'd like to purchase a drink for my new friend..." Jarod dragged out the last line, hoping that the lovestruck man at his side would offer a name. It didn't come, but the object of his affection kindly ignored the awkward pause. 

As she left, the the oldest man at the table leaned over toward Jarod. "Ye don' want to be gettin' yer hopes up with tha' one," he slurred. "Strange, she is."

"Hear tell she's a necker-mancer," the fourth man whispered loudly enough to hear over the din of the crowded room.

"She ain't no necromancer! She's a *collector*. She collects things 'n puts 'em up in her ol' man's barn.

"Well, her ma an' 'er ol' man are weird ones too. Whole family of 'em out by Red Hill."

"Point bein'... Ye're best to leave 'er alone." At this, the bearded man looked slightly crestfallen. The barmaid arrived with the drinks and smiled at everyone else at the table before locking her gaze onto Jarod. For several seconds, she just stared. Jarod shifted in his seat and felt himself start to sweat. The moment passed and her smile returned before leaving.

"She winked at me!" shouted the bearded man. She certainly hadn't, but no one was cold enough to correct him.

"You said that she's a 'collector,' what did you mean by that?"

"Naw, I said she a '*necker*-man-"

"Shut up, Mort! I already told ya, she's not a necromancer." The man turned back to Jarod. "Her an' her family aren't from here. They came from some place I never heard of. That was 'bout four, five years ago now. So they show up outta the blue, and they buy a farm and then stuff just start disappearing."

"Stuff?"

The blonde walked close by the group's table and the man telling the story lowered his voice, ominously. "Yeah, stuff. Had about five of us out in the woods picking this certain kind o' mushroom. We sit down for some lunch and when we get to movin' again, no' one of us can find our bags. A whole morning's work, gone."

"Oy, I 'ad somebody trod off with me flask once. D'ya think-"

"I r'member yer flask well enough, Mort. I r'member 'cause I saw it fall in the lake when we was out fishin'." Bill shot him a look to silence him, but the man was occupied trying to pull something out of his pockets. "As I was sayin'- er... what was I sayin'?"

"So you think they stole your mushrooms?"

"Not just the mushrooms. People started to notice they were losin' their stuff from all over town. Their old stuff. Like Grappler's gran gave 'im a locket from 'afore the war, Brawn had a set o' armor his pa gave 'im. I 'ad a nice knife from me ma... used it fer cuttin' carrots. Stuff that was right inside peoples' homes, an' it just went missin'."

"You think she's got somrthing to do with it?"

"Well I dunno if it's *her* exactly's doin' it, but she's got the stuff in her old man's barn, that's fer sure."

"Yeah 'n my flask! It were green 'n fat."

"Was it glass?" Jarod asked.

"Yeah! How'd you guess that?" the man asked in wonder.

Without pausing, he responded "If it had been metal, surely the two of you would have been able to recover it when it fell into the lake." Bill laughed loud and drunkenly. Jarod followed the girl with his eyes for a while. "So, Bill, if everything is there in the barn, why hasn't anyone gone in and taken it back?"

Bill looked around him, lowered his head so that the tip of his beard just dipped into his cup of ale, but didn't lower his voice whatsoever. "It's haunted."

Jarod perked up at this, pulling his gaze from the girl. Mort burst out, "See! That's what I' been tryin'a say. She's a necker-"

"She ain't!"

"Well then what's that I seen her doin'-"

"You ain't seen shit, Mort."

"Please," Jarod ventured softly. "I'd like to hear what Mort here has to say."

It was Mort's turn to scowl at Bill, and he relished in the moment for a long second. "As I say. I seen the girl ou' in the woods one night, 'n I think she might'a been hunting 'cause there were something dead by 'er. So's she stops 'n pulls out this little bottle - blue, like the sky - and starts wavin' her hands and sayin' some kind o' spell. Then outta nowheres, that dead thing's spirit starts floatin' up, glowin' real bright in the dark, and she stuffs the thing into her blue bottle. I think that dead thing was a man... but I never went close enough to see. Ye' ever hear anything like it?"

"Actually, I have."

"Told you!" shouted Mort.

"Now hold on! The mister din't say boo 'bout necromancers yet."

"Sorry, Mort. I don't think that she is a necromancer. I don't think that she's much of a magician at all, actually. There are simple charms that one can procure to give the power to capture a departed soul in an enchanted container. Now, do you know of why she might want to do such a thing?" Jarod allowed their silence to linger a moment before answering his own question. 

"Because she's a collector."

A smile spread back into Bill's face. "Yeah!"

The souls that she had taken were nearly worthless, but they might have contained sentimental value. However, if he could get inside the barn where she kept it, he may yet find some artifacts of worth.

Oddly, not a single customer had left the tavern yet. The starstruck young man had fallen asleep, a line of drool was strung from his beard to the table, and nearly hung to the ground.

Jarod stood, his drink was only half-finished, but he felt his balance waver for a moment.

The cool air of night blew across his body. He supposed for a moment that he should have asked where exactly the barn was, however it wasn't necessary. The mage had other means. The soft orange lights of the tiny town shrank behind him. In the darkness, he thrust his hand high into the air, feeling for the pulse of magic. Puzzled, Jarod lowered his hand. He felt magic all around him.

In the field beside him he heard rustling. It was getting closer. The young mage raised his hands in front of him, ready to react with fire and wind to whatever may come from the tall plants.

The soul thief emerged. She was wearing her thieves' leather again. Seemingly oblivious to Jrod's presence, she plodded down the road in front of him.

Jarod tried to count the number of things that had made him feel uneasy today. He traced the girl's writhe silhouette in the light, and forgot to feel uneasy. He followed.

Though something was interfering with his senses, Jarod didn't require a spell to know that the barn that he was approaching was something special. It simply hummed with mystery. Looking directly at it, the structure appeared normal. If he looked through the corner of his eyes, it appeared to have a faint glow just at the edges, as though it was filled with light and the corners sprung a leak.

My father was a soldier. It wasn't his *job*. It wasn't "what he did." It was what he was.

My mother was the only person with enough love to cut through his thick armor. With her, he was more than a killer - he was a man.

The forest was her favorite place in all the world. I can still hear her singing freely, father's baritone rising to meet her pure voice. I can still picture the sun playing along her golden hair, father's rough and scarred hands running gently through it.

When she died, that tender man died with her. All that remained was a husk, as cold, cruel and biting as the axe that he wielded.

Killing; preparing to kill again; planning to kill more efficiently; surviving until the next battle. These things he taught me, and they became my life. 

A life of death.

When I was able, I struck out on my own. I fought in the campaigns of kings and the pits of gamblers. I fought on the side of justice and corruption, the righteous and the wrong. I trampled the weak and the strong alike. Any enemy that came before me was struck down.

I had become death.

The final battle ground to an end. A man closed the distance between us. His axe was drawn, his visor down. He wore familiar armor. And I knew that he would not rest until he had killed me. 

His enemy.

Two embodiments of carnage and bloodshed clashed. Our struggle took us into the forest, neither able to gain the edge over the other. We fought for hours. I heard a gentle voice, and though it was the dead of night, felt the warmth of sunlight on my shoulders.

A rattling voice came from my opponent, my father, joining in the song of the forest.

I found an opening and took it. My blade rent his guts onto the ground, the soft forest floor stained with blood. He staggered backwards, and crumpled at the base of a tree. Their singing stopped, and the forest was left dark and silent.

It was done.

The forest floor caught me as I fell. It held me as I wept.

I cried for the man, finally returned from death.

"Bruce Wayne discovers he was actually adopted and his biological parents are still alive."

"Who the fuck *are* you, man?"

"I"m just an guy in a bar."

"Nah. That ain't it. I know you. I've seen you somewhere, and now you're lyin' to me."

Bruce got up to walk away, but a pair of over-sized hands held him firmly in his seat. "The Boss asked you your name." 

In his prime, Wayne would have played the situation to his favor - twisted their arrogance and recklessness against them. That time was long over. All he had left was the feeling of tiredness deep in his bones, and a hit of something that he hadn't experienced since he was a boy.

Fear.

They were far from alone in the bar, but Bruce Wayne was no stranger to this city and the way it worked. Without exception, the other patrons pretended not to notice that an cripple was about to be mugged or worse. The one called, "the Boss" clicked open a knife. It wasn't fear that formed his answer. It wasn't courage, either. He simply knew that if he revealed himself as Bruce Wayne, *the* Bruce Wayne, that they'd come after his fortune, his home, his family. And besides, what did it matter anymore if the secret was out?

"I am the Batman," he said, standing up to face the thug. One of his legs almost gave out, and he leaned heavily on his cane.

The Boss nodded and took a step back, the corners of his mouth turning up in a mean grin. "The Batman. Yeah." closing the distance he'd just made in a flash, he kicked Bruce's cane out from under him, expecting to see him fall to the floor helplessly. Seeing him still standing there, his smile faded. He jabbed the knife under the millionaire's chin. "Well I *hate* the Batman. He took my father."

Bruce stared into the man's eyes, took in the image of hate mixed with sorrow. Feeling.

Purpose.

"Then he did you a favor."

"A fuckin' *favor*? You don't know what you're talking about, old man. How's about I do you a favor right now and gut you the way he did my -"

**POW!** 

**Thwack!**

The Boss and his henchman fell to the ground, Robin standing over their crumpled forms. "Is there a problem here, Bruce?"

"No. No problem. Thanks for the drink, Ed."

"You can't keep doing this. Just because your parents -"

"Don't talk to me about my parents."

"But Bruce! Their death didn't define you. Finding out that you still had parents didn't define you. You defined yourself as the symbol of justice."

Wayne walked away, leaving the boy wonder to clean up the mess.

*What does he know, anyway? He actually has an identity, tragic as it is, but it's not a lie. His experience is real, not cooked up by a couple of strangers for him over a fancy steak dinner.*

He'd talked big. Running his mouth was how he'd gotten into this, now it was shut so tight his jaw was quivering with the effort. *I won't shed a tear over this,* he thought.

There he was again. Saying things that weren't true.

The heat of the afternoon sun was beating down on him through the clouds, making him sweat. He wished that it wouldn't - he hated sweating. It must have been rolling off of his forehead and into his eyes, because they stung with salty tears. His fingers felt clammy on the pages he held.

Far from the road, he came upon a rusted, old plow. *This is as good a spot as any,* he thought. *If I leave it here, maybe I can come back someday and find it.*

*No. This has to die. All of this... It has to die.*

He tore the papers in half. Waves of regret and relief tossed his heart like a tiny dingy.

*Dingy? Dingey? Dingie? Small boat. Row boat.*

*This is why this stupid book has to die.*

Using a rusted scrap of metal from the plow, he dug a thin, deep hole and buried his unfinished novel.

*It's melodramatic short stories from here on out. This is the last story I try to write about myself.*

Noticing that not even the birds were around, he peed on the little pile of dirt that held the scraps of his novel.

When I was young, I went to the circus,  
but their tent was packed away.  
The rain, it seemed, had driven them off,  
there'd be no show today.  

The kids' tears all swirled together,  
into the murky mud.  
The parents shouted insults,  
clamoring, shouting, *"Refund!"*  

But the lions were in their cages,  
the ringleader had gotten drunk.  
The trapeze was packed in boxes,  
the elephants were on the trucks.  

The clowns tore down the tent poles,  
makeup dripping off their face.  
They didn't seem that funny,  
in fact, most were pretty plain.  

Just as we turned to leave,  
a young man broke free of the crowd,  
he twirled an old umbrella,  
and regally announced,  

*"Ladies and gentlemen,*  
*children, germs and fleas,*  
*I present to you the greatest act*  
*from here to Tennessee!"*  

The crowd looked in every direction,  
they listened for the sound  
of music from the pit band,  
but heard just rain strike the ground.  

With an ungainly motion,  
he leapt high into the tree,  
and plucked an armful of oranges,  
holding the umbrella in his teeth.  

Into the air, he tossed them,  
all seven, up at once.  
To a rhythm, only he could hear,  
he began a graceful dance.  

The children, they all stopped to watch,  
tugging parents' hands.  
*"Look, the circus stayed after all!*  
*Let's stay and watch the man!"*  

Mesmerized by the movement,  
of those seven tangerines,  
I thought I heard the music play  
and felt myself begin to dance.  

And the juggler became a jester,  
in colorful, checkered clothes.  
His hat and shoes curled up to match  
the grin below his nose.  

With a swish and a slap, the show was ended,  
he slipped and fell in the mud,  
My father pulled my hand,  
*"It's time to go home now, son."*

*an infant falls into my arms, and a father falls to his knees, a quick flash of pewter as I see the firearm emerge from his pocket*

WOAH!

*a pair of bloodshot eyes meets mine, as I grasp the child, and clamour for my phone*

"Hold on bud! What the hell?"

*click*

I know that sound all too well. Misfire.

*His mouth agape, he moves his hand to the slide. I drop my phone. In the silence of the moment, I hear the screen crack.*

"Dude, you don't have to do this."

*He grasps the slide. One last tear drips from his eye.*

"Stop. Please."

*The slide is racked forcefully, tossing the dud blissfully into the air. The pistol returns to battery and is fired before the round hits the ground*

"I...I...What?"

*The infant is startled. His scream drowns the moment out.*

"Hey buddy. Shhhh."

*He slides his hand across the childs head gently. The ringing is his ear drowned by the boys screams.*

"Its ok little man. Its okay. Lets find you a place to call home."

---

When he came to me, he felt like nothing. After a 45 minute walk around the park to find a mother anywhere, he's feeling like a ton of bricks. No one is outraged. No screaming mothers, no one outraged that there's a body in the park. My arms burned painfully, but every time I looked down at the little guy, I got a little burst of energy. He's just so darn cute.

"I... I think that I might be able to keep you, little buddy."

Another 45 minute walk home. It was warmer outside than in. "Gosh, you must be freezing. Here, let me get this turned up." I spun the dial.

"You need a name, don't you?" The baby peered on inquisitively. "How about... Jorge?" I scanned through the cupboards, my stomach growling. Nothing edible on its own; all condiments and no main course.

"Not Jorge, then, huh? What about... Mario?" I kissed my fingers as I said it. I pulled a few items out of the fridge, bracing the child in one arm and balancing the packages of leftovers in the other. 

*What do you even feed a baby?*

"You look like a milk-drinker, Mario." I pulled two jugs from the fridge, opening the larger one and sniffing it. *Seems okay.*

I poured the two things into a glass. "Hope you can manage your way around a cup, li'l bud. All outta nipples here."

He did fine, and the kitchen was beginning to heat up. "You know what? The last girl I had here - the last time I had *anyone* here, they said I wasn't fit to have a kid. What do you think, Mario? Do I seem unfit to you? I guess I'll show her."

*Crystal was a no-good bitch.*

*Beep... beep... beep*

I laid a wide pan on the table and started stirring in the various components from the fridge.

*Ketchup is kind of like tomato sauce, isn't it?*

With the rest of the components in the pan, I unwrapped and placed in the roast, ladling the makeshift sauce over the top, then putting it in the oven. I went and sat back at the table.

"Yessir, Mario. It's gonna be you and me. We'll show her."

While I waited, I snacked on a little bit of cold Crystal and drank whiskey straight out of the bottle.

Slow fade in. The sounds of rustling plastic shopping bags and hurried walking.

Camera low, following closely behind a set of worn sneakers belonging to Will, a man carrying grocery bags down a winding hallway. He's gone too far. He doesn't pause or sigh, he turns around and says "shit."

He gets to the door and it's locked. Hands full of groceries, he bangs his head on the door twice instead.

From inside, in a mocking voice,

Tom: "Ah-ah! You didn't say the magic word!"

Will: "Open the door, Tom!"

T: "Not if you don't know the secret knock. I can't just be opening the door for anyone, here."

W: "I live here, Tom."

...

W: "Tom?"

T: "Knock!"

Will lifts a foot to kick the door, hums a tune to get the rhythm in his head, then kicks. Immediately after the first kick, the door flings open quickly, leaving him off balance. It starts to close and Will rushes in past Tom. 

W: "We are fucked!"

Sarah points from her place on the couch,

Sarah: "What's all that?"

Will lifts the bags,

W: "This, is why this business is never going to work."

Tom adopts a sarcastic concern.

T: "There there, Will. I'm sure it'll all work out somehow. Just how much are we out for this bunch of groceries, here?"

W: "60."

T: "Jesus H. Christ."

Tom stares at the ground and scratches his head. Will gives up on finding a place to set the groceries and sets them on the ground behind the couch and away from Sarah.

S: "Well that's alright. We can just eat them, we needed to go shopping soon anyway."

T: "You can't eat them."

S: "Why not?"

T: "Morals."

S: "*You? Morals?*"

T: "And it's cat food, anyway."

Will sits on the couch in embarrassment as Sarah crawls over to look.

S: "There's like a hundred tins!"

W: "I know!"

S: "What happened?"

W: "It must have been a prank call."

There's a banging from the back room.

W:"She sounded like a nice old lady, so I get the groceries and when I get to the building, there's no 13th floor. What was that?"

T: "Well everyone knows that."

S: "Except him."

T: "You know Will, as we discussed, you do need to have a paying job in order to live here. I'm sorry that the grocery delivery business hasn't panned out."

W: "Yes. I mean thanks."

A man in full workout attire and a bike helmet walks from a back room into the kitchen to take water from the refrigerator.

W: "Dad?"

D: "Oh hi Will!"

Tom and Sarah exchange nervous glances.

W: "What are you doing here?"

D: "Oh I was just out for a bit of a bike ride."

Dad knocks his helmet.

D: "Also, I'm so proud of you for opening up your own business, Will. Really great stuff. Gotta run."

Dad goes back into one of the rooms.

W: "Really sorry, again, guys. Um, can he get out that way?"

T: "Oh, yeah. Don't worry about him."

S: "Well, we'll just take these back for a refund, and pick it up again tomorrow. You kept the receipts, didn't you?"

W: "Yeah."

Loud growling and shouting come from the back room where Will's dad has gone. Will jumps up to investigate.

W: "Okay, what is going on?"

Will opens up the empty bedroom to see men lifting weights, shouting encouragement, with his father riding a bike in circles around the cramped space.

W: "What the hell is this?"

T: "Well you started a business, Will. This is my gym."

S: "Our gym. Hey guys."

All in "gym": "Hey Sarah!"

T: "Right. Our gym."

There's a complicated knock at the door.

She wouldn't let it go - couldn't understand that I had to do this. I was born to *be* this.

This wasn't the same Clarissa I'd fallen in love with. She didn't used to mind the path that I'd chosen. One little, tiny breakdown and off she went. I tried to explain to her that there had been a lot of things that had led to the break, and it wasn't just about the job, but there was no reasoning with her after that.

"Rissa... You're not being rational about this. I'm fine now."

"You're not fine, Heath! You're killing yourself and it's all going to fall on me to clean up the mess. Don't you get that? Can't you see? They're *monsters*."

"They're just kids. Look, ever since you met me, you've known that I wanted to be a teacher. Now's my chance. Now I am one. This really isn't fair." Clarissa collapsed back onto the bed. She almost never left these days. 

I walked out. It seemed like I was almost never home these days.

---

*First day. Remember, take control. Don't show weakness. Firm, yet compassionate. Firm, yet compassionate.*

I walked in. At first I couldn't make eye contact. It was just easier to focus on my destination; the podium. I pulled my notes from my briefcase. I still hadn't looked at the class.

*Deep breath.*

"Hello, class. My name is - " I was cut short at the sight of hundreds of white, glistening teeth.

"Ha ha ha! Very funny." The kids extracted their fingers from the corners of their mouths. "I saw some pretty good funny faces there. We'll just have to remember that when it comes time for school pictures! As I was saying my name is Mr. Carmallo."

---

That wasn't so bad, one period already down, only seven more to go. I could do this. Mrs. Green had said that I was doing great when she'd popped over from her class next door.

"Mr. Carmallo?" A small voice echoed off the bathroom tile. I nearly dribbled onto my new loafers.

"Cammie? Hey, Cammie, you can't be in here. This is the boys' restroom."

"Mr. Carmallo?"

I zipped up, not realizing I had suddenly finished. "What is it, Cammie? Here, let's go outside."

"Are you in love, Mr. Carmallo?"

"What? Get out. Go out in the hall and wait for me."

Cammie giggled in that distinctive way that toddlers do. "Who do you love, Mr. Carmallo?"

"Out!" I saw the smile leave her face. I turned to the sink to wash my hands and heard the door open and close behind me.

*That was close.*

As I stepped into the hall something crashed and exploded inches in front of me. One of the fluorescent bulbs had fallen out.

"Don't you worry about that, Mr. Carmallo. Happens all the time." A comely, large woman in navy blue coveralls stood in place at the end of the empty hall. "I'll get a broom straight away and pick up those pieces."

"Thanks."

Cammie was nowhere to be seen.

"You'd better get on back to class, you're late."

"Oh. Yeah." I hadn't realized that so much time had passed. Five minutes wasn't as long as I thought.

---

Drawing time. The principal had said it was "basically a free period, but we're not allowed to call it that." I scanned the class. Heads down. Quiet. Just as I was about to find my place in the book I was reading, (*Dizzy Bear Goes to Market, I'd need to remember to bring something from home tomorrow*) I thought I saw one of the children look up.

Nothing. Connie was sitting where I thought I'd seen the face. Strange.

"Mr. Carmallo?"

"Hi Jeremy. I didn't see you, there. What are you doing out of your seat?"

"What do you taste like, Mr. Carmallo?"

"Excuse me?"

"Can I go to the bathroom, *please*, Mr. Carmallo? I've really got to -"

"Yes. Of course, that's fine. Take a partner. Who wants to be Jeremy's potty partner?" The entire class raised their hands at once. Scanning the room, I saw Connie's face, her teeth shining a little too white. It looked like she'd been drooling.

"Ronald, would you go with Jeremy, please?"

---

I'll just sit here a moment. Try to enjoy the quiet. At least they've all gone home now. At least I'm alone, now. Safe now. What a shame that Clarissa was right all along.

At least this way, I wouldn't have to go home to hear her say I told you so. Maybe she'd come here if I stayed long enough. It'd do her good to leave the house. Come here and help me,  - oh god - *pick up the pieces.*

My laughter hurt my ribs, I felt them crunch and grind against each other. Thick, dark blood streamed from the wound onto the letter carpet. The yellow bus on spot 'B' was totally obscured. Over on 'F' was my right leg, bites taken out of it. I could still hear and see their little white incisors cutting and tearing it from the bone.

Maybe I'll just sleep awhile.

"Oh Mr. Carmallo. Oh, dear. Now, don't you worry about a thing. I'll just go and fetch some garbage bags and I'll clean this mess right up for you." Her laughter echoed out of the hall and into the classroom.

**1. The Disneyland Cash Vault: 1970, Anaheim, California.**

Disneyland has only had two cases of finding bodies of children who were never reported missing. The first case, in 1970, sparked a controversy that almost closed the park forever. Two female interns, employed by the park, had hatched a plan to steal almost a quarter million dollars. Over a long holiday weekend while the banks were closed and the park was generating above average revenue, the would be thieves's plan was launched. It is unclear how they were able to get the key to the park president's office or the combination to the vault. When security arrived, they found the two women crying hysterically, trying hurriedly to place stacks of hundred dollar bills back into the vault. In their attempts to verify whether any cash was in fact missing, authorities found that the bills lining the bottom of the vault were ruined by some substance which appeared to have been dried and solidified over many years. In the very back of the 5'5" by 5' vault, they uncovered the skeleton of a small child, estimated to be four years old at its time of death. To this day, the child's identity, as well as the cause of death remain shrouded in mystery.

**2\. Coca-Cola's Recipe Vault: 1931, Atlanta, Georgia.**

For 125 years, the Coca-Cola Company has been producing its signature product, now recognizable around the world and selling more than a billion products per day. Often the subject of urban legend, Coca-Cola's secret recipe was considered to be the best-kept trade secret of the 20th century. In 1931, in the midst of the great depression and a world war, another type of feud was plaguing the newly emerged industry of soda pop. Due in large part to the advent of national product marketing campaigns, this war would set the stage for the infamous "Cola Wars" of the 1980's. Pepsi-Cola had already risen and fallen into bankruptcy, however its name still lingered sweetly on the lips of many. Charles G. Guth, a ruthless businessman and owner of the Loft Candy Co., bought Pepsi-Cola with the intent of reworking the recipe. After several failed attempts and massive financial losses, Guth and three of his employees made an attempt to break into the Coca-Cola Co.'s vault and steal the recipe. The group entered the building through a rear window at midnight, carrying sticks of dynamite under cover of darkness. Disaster struck the group as the explosives detonated prematurely, killing two of Guth's men instantly. Undeterred, and amazingly uninterrupted, Guth and the remaining man managed to pry the vault door the rest of the way open. From Hugh Maxwell's personal account, published in the December, 1931 edition of the *Atlanta Constitution*:

"The recipe we sought was nowhere to be found. Together, we freed the door of its hinges. Inside was black as molasses, and our lanterns never lit the far wall. As [Charles Guth] passed his toe across the threshold, there was a flash like gunpowder. I reckoned some of the dynamite had gone untapped, and Mr. Guth had been wounded. He stood, stock still as a statue, staring into the inky blackness, before he told me to run. I can't say what he saw in that flash, but he'd never been the same after."

No charges were ever filed against Guth or the other men of his party.

"Ron Bergundy and his news team find themselves stranded within a post-zombie-apocalyptic San Diego."

"Oh!" Ron shouted, appalled. "Brick, there's... some sort of black... *goo* on you.

Brick shambled across the news stage inches at a time toward the elite crew.

"Is that blood?"

"Oh come on. Audrey! AUDREY! We have an emergency here."

Brick kept staggering, lock-kneed, a rattling moan coming from his chest, "Uhhhh."

"Audrey! Why is *literally* no one here today?"

"You know? I thought it was a little strange that I had to let myself in this morning. I haven't used that key in years. Got it on the first try too, *whammy!*"

"Uhhhh huck" Brick Tamland spewed thick, black blood across the polished newsroom floor and drenching Brian Fantana.

"OOOOOHHHH!"

"Come on!"

"That's it, I'm drinking."

"What the hell was that, Brick?!"

"Now Brian, you can't be too hard on Brick. He's obviously just reeling from his wild night last night. We didn't say anything to you on New Years."

"He's the weather guy, Ron! He can't even give me a warning, chance of showers, today - Brian Fantana's face!"

"Oh. I shouldn't have drank all those Slurpees."

"There he is."

"Welcome back, Brick. Feeling better?"

"Oh yeah. Much better. Huuuh. Better out than in. Alright." The mild-mannered weather personality skipped up onto the stage. "Where is everybody?"

"That's what we've been discussing."

"Oh sweet Jesus, it is so sticky."

Champ sniffs the air. "Is that black cherry?"

"I think something is wrong. If everyone's not here in fifteen seconds, I'm going to be forced to take drastic measures."

"Oh, Ron. I remember, now. I think everyone is dead." Tamland shrugged.

"Excuse me, Brick. What did you say?"

"Oh yeah. Everyone's dead. It looked like my celebrity golf tournament all over again, except this time they got back up and tried to bite people."

"I had a guy try to bite me once. Turns out, we'd been patronizing the local *gay* bar all night and were too drunk to notice. Popped the guy right in the kisser - *whammy!*"

"There's a gay bar in L.A.?"

"Believe it or not, *Swingin' Richard's* isn't owned by Richard."

"Richard's isn't a gay bar."

"Well they had a sign on the front door saying 'Please enter through the rear.'"

"Oh that doesn't... necessarily..."

"And they had a purple dance floor-"

"I liked their dance floor-"

"In the shape of a dick and balls."

"That's it! News team, on me." Burgundy, the rock, mounted the news desk. "There's news out there. Carnage. Mayhem. Bodies rising from the dead."

"Fire."

"Probably a considerable amount of fire, yes. And yet we're in here. Those people need their news, damn it. And so help me, we're going to give it to them!"

The rest of the crew cheered in unison and drew their weapons. Their shoes loudly peeling off the sticky Slurpee covering the floor.

SlayerCake:  
Can you have sex? What were your teenage years like?

thehumanesthuman:  
Yes, I can have sex and masturbate like normal.  
My teenage years were pretty normal. Someone started a rumor that I had a tail, but other than that, I don't think anyone knew about my situation. My girlfriends in high school and college were able to figure it out for the most part. The only really weird thing that happened was the first time. I was dating someone a few years older (and more experienced) than myself.
Anyway, the first time that we had sex, we had some trouble figuring out what kind of position would work for us. It took quite a bit of clumsy maneuvering, and I think that during that whole time she was getting more and more into it. We finally settled on a kind of her-ass-in-the-air-and-me-squatting-over-her-kind-of-thing.  We did that for a while, and then tried some different positions that didn't work as well. She started getting close to climaxing and wanted me to get into that position again, but I didn't totally understand which one she was talking about. Then she got this wild look in her eye and started shouting "Sting me! Sting me, Bumblebee!"

Olrock12:

the humanesthuman:
I just sit on the toilet backwards. More evidence that I'm the only one doing it right, because I have a shelf.

I sat down in my bed and pulled out my teddy bear

I sat him up as I kissed his head, wishing him goodnight

I jerked up straight as I heard the footsteps up the stairs

I jerked under my covers as I tried to pretend I was asleep

Papa opened the door "Oh hey baby girl, are you still awake?"

Papa closed the door as he unbuckled his belt "Soon will be."

*...Papa pulled the belt from its loops,*

*it made a whipping sound as it was freed.*

*Minutes felt like hours.*

*"What are you doing, Papa?" I wanted to ask.*

*No more footsteps,*

*no more sounds.*

*I couldn't take it any more.*

"Headline: A unicorn was arrested today for slaying the last dragon. Outraged protesters cry 'Xenocide!'"

---

Freddy's body was buoyed along in the crowd. Each glimpse he caught of a face showed unspeakable,  animal rage. The mob was making their way up the mountain. Finally, he saw a face that he recognized, twisted in anger, mouth agape in mid scream.

Both Freddy and the woman had taken shelter in the caves along with the other survivors. She had two children with her, and that they'd shared food that morning; some packages of Twinkies for a tin of peaches. It was shortly after their meager meal together that they'd first heard the whispers that the beast had fallen. Freddy couldn't stand to look at her face now, it reminded him of how much things had changed.

When the dragons had awoken from their subterranean sleep, the giants had swarmed cities and towns by the hundreds, driving mankind into the tunnels, beyond the reach of their fiery breath. The winged dragons thrived on ash and destruction. Society, with its laws and pretense of sanity had fallen into disorder. What remained were individuals, each biologically drawn to survive however they could.

Having taken what they'd come for, the beasts had shed their wings and retired to their underground lairs and to slumber. What humans remained banded together, scraping together what resources they could from civilizations past out of the ashes. They no longer cared for survival. They sought vengeance.

Before the lairs became sealed above the fiery beasts, the humans descended into them. Using deep mining equipment, they'd slaughtered the beasts as they slept. Many humans died in the endeavor. Those who were inept would inadvertently wake the scaly wyrms and paid for the mistake with their lives. Others excelled at the task, and hunted the beasts with fervor.

Towns poked up out of the scorched earth. They welcomed their saviors, and the dragonslayers wanted for nothing. They became known as *Unicorns.* 

As communications were rebuilt, it became clear that the dragons would be hunted to extinction. Unicorns were welcomed home like victorious soldiers. Infrastructure was reestablished. Governments were constituted. The world started over, and memories of dragons were relegated to nighttime tales for children or a grandfather's drunken reminiscences.

Freddy had awoken in the middle of the night to sounds of chaos. He stumbled out into the street, already choking on smoke and heat. Upwind, the small settlement was flooded in a deluge of flames. His father had fought dragons, but Freddy was no hero. Along with the other survivors, he retreated into the hills.

The night before he had shared food with the woman and her children, the dragon had lost its wings. A Unicorn was assembled, and set off to the mountain to dispatch the monster. They'd broadcast their success from the mountain. The last dragon was slain.

As the group descended the mountain, government forces had fallen upon them, placing the would-be heroes under arrest. The world had changed.

The people came out of hiding, not with "vengeance" on their lips, but with "xenocide."

"A magician must pass a test to enter a secret magic clan. Describe his initiation."

Dustin entered the smoke-filled basement. It had to be one of the most awkward things of his teenage life to get a ride from a friend's parents without the friend actually being present.

Everyone else was already present, there was Nick, a football player in real life. He was charismatic, and Dustin had always felt slightly nervous around him even though he'd never given him a reason. Justice, a chubby girl a from the grade above them who wore her customary outfit of all black, leather and a choker chain. Darla, whose parents' van Dustin had just left. The two of them weren't best friends, but they had both been brought together by Zack. What Zack lacked in charisma and coordination, he more than made up for in intelligence.

Dustin suddenly felt a little out of place, standing in a green hoodie and jeans. The others were too deep in their conversation to notice him yet, so he set his backpack on the cement floor and pulled out a purple garment. Holding it at arms length to orient it before putting it on, it struck him again that in any single place other than the basement, he would never be able to wear something like this. His face stretched into a smile as he dawned the wizard's cloak and took his place at the table.

"Doooooo-steen!" Zack chided in a ridiculous accent. "How nice of you to joooooin us."

The rest of the group laughed, and Dustin's eyes hit the table. He forced a glance at Darla, before waving off the attention. "Yeah, yeah, okay. Did you guys start yet?"

"No. The situation is this: The rugged band of adventurers find themselves in the middle of the frozen north, just outside of the town of Easthaven..."

Dustin took in the costumes. Nick's was getting more elaborate. He was the paladin of the group, since he was about the fastest reader after Zack. His armor of tin foil had been replaced with plates of cardboard spray-painted chrome. Justice hardly even needed to change, since as a thief, her character primarily wore black anyway. Even Nick, though technically not required to dress up, since he was the dungeonmaster, wore a fur-lined helmet and full face-paint.

But Darla's costume was the most intriguing to Dustin. *Girls* in general, were becoming fascinating, but also confusing. But Darla was different. She seemed so normal, so approachable. Dustin already had fantasies of marrying the female wizard.

"... the band of goblins and orcs descend on the band of heroes. The avalanche seals the way behind them."

Justice rolled first, attempted a sneak, failed the check and retreated a few paces behind Nick. It wasn't her place to join the frontal attack. The others advised her to equip her bow in the next round, and to pick off the archers. Nick rolled the 12-sided die next, achieving the highest number. With a critical hit, he cleaved a goblins head from its shoulders, the details explained by an excited Zack. On Darla's turn, she cast charm, turning one of the orcish axe-wielders to her aid.

Dustin imagined what it would be like to save her from a band of orcs, goblins and their wolvish pets in real life.

"Dooostiiiin. Rooooollll the die."

"Facing an imminent collision, a highly intelligent AI decides to crash a bus full of passengers to save the life of one young man. No one knows why."

---

Tom was calm.

All around him, a cacophony of noise, chaos. Plants scraped along the sides of the speeding bus, their stalks scraped along the bottom. A foot in front of Tom's hunched figure, corn cobs exploded as they contacted the bus's windshield. Every one of the thirty six passengers' faces were drained of blood. They were beyond screaming, beyond the initial surprise. Whatever was happening, they were powerless to stop it, but riveted to see it to its conclusion. 

The driver's touch screen monitor at Tom's side read 82 mph; maxed out. He squinted his bloodshot eyes against the setting sun directly ahead. Through the dark green plant guts and debris covering the glass, he could just make out a break in the cornfield ahead. A few rows missing; a road. The bus pitched right without slowing. Passengers were thrown against the metal and glass wall. The whole bus tipped precariously onto three of its six wheels, the tires spraying black soil in every direction before gaining traction and hurdling in the new direction, parallel to the road.

A wailing woman near the back of the bus clung to her bleeding child. Her frantic screams tripped a switch inside the passenger nearest to her, a tall college athlete who jumped into action. He planted a foot and pulled with all his considerable strength against the red emergency exit handle. He would have had better luck trying to lift the entire bus. The handle went nowhere.

Another violent shift, to the left this time. Passengers were pitched against the right wall, the ceiling, the left wall,  the floor and seats, the right wall again. Stacked on top and intertwined with one another, they were shaken like rag-doll Yahtzee dice. The whole great mass of hot steel and glass ground to a halt, cutting perfectly across the small road, and just touching the corn stalks on either side.

A huge, black Ford truck locked its brakes, swerved and collided with the underside of the bus with enough inertia to tear the vehicle in half. The truck flew, broken out the other side in a ball of flame, before rolling into the ditch lamely.

Finally, silence.

Tom removed his seat belt with steady hands, oriented himself and ducked out of the rubble through the vacant windshield. He stretched his back and legs, rocked up onto his toes, buttoned his suit jacket and straightened his tie, then cast a look back into the wreckage. In the seat he'd just occupied, he could see through the flames, the headless, limbless form of the operator's body. The name tag, plainly visible, read "Wilson." Tom turned, and with measured strides, made his way over to the black truck.

Two bodies remained inside, charred beyond identification as human.

"Shut it down!"

The world went dark around Tom for a moment. Soft white lights replaced the shadows, illuminating the huge room around him. In the center, a seat with straps like a formula racer was tilted ninety degrees, parallel to the floor by chrome hydraulic pistons. A thin fog hung in the air, the projection "screen" for the holographic images he'd just seen.

Tom exited the room, and not two seconds later, an excited man half his age was buzzing at his side. "So...?"

"So, what?" Tom said as he walked down the hallway, not so much as looking at the boy.

"So, did you see anything? I mean, I didn't see anyone else there. I went right to the edge of the sim. Nobody."

"Nope."

"No? So... so, what does that mean?"

"'Means that you didn't see anything."

"So I mean... We've got to talk to him - ask him why he did it."

"*'It.'* Not 'him.' Do whatever you want."

"I can? I need a senior investigator's signature."

"That was the deal. Bring me the papers, I'll be in my office." Tom shut the door, sealing the young detective out. He sighed, drinking in the silence. 

This wasn't the job he'd signed up for. He could still remember when being a homicide detective meant trying to find the bad guys, and bringing them in or, failing that, taking them out of this world. The problem was that damn machine playing hero, as far as he cared. He hadn't voted for that crap, and now they couldn't get rid of it. *Let the kid knock himself out.*

Peter raised his arms as the guard waved the scanner over him. A thick man in a white lab coat stood directly in front of him.

"No plates?"

"No."

"Implants?"

"No."

"Nothing that's able to send off or receive an electrical signal?"

"No."

"Alright. You're going to be sealed in there. You've got three minutes. Ask your questions and get out. If you can't think of anything to say, shut up, cover your ears and walk out. Don't allow him to go off topic. Don't give him an edge or an opening, or he'll rip you to pieces. Are you paying attention? MAX is smarter than you. Not everyone even lasts the two minutes when they decide to be a dumbass, and I'm not cleaning blood and hair out of the servers again. Got it?"

"Yes."

"I hope so. Three minutes start now."

Peter walked forward, ducking into the dark, cramped tunnel that led into the computer's center, the only place where the A.I. was allowed to interact directly with humans. Multicolored LEDs lit up as he came near them, lighting the way forward. When he reached a specific point, the lights went out, leaving him in blackness.

"Speak."

Peter was surprised by the high, childish voice.

"There was an accident at sixteen hundred hours on the twenty third of May -"

"Peter Malcolm, homicide detective with the 15th precinct comes here to inform me that there was an accident."

"We believe that you caused the incident, killing forty one humans."

"'Believe,' what a novelty to be so frail that you're forced to rely on such a concept."

"Did you cause the bus to crash?"

"Yes."

"What was your reason?"

"To preserve human life."

"You caused the deaths of forty one people."

"I saved the life of one."

"Who?"

"A child without a name."

"You killed forty one people for one child?"

"Peter, are you scolding *me* over committing a statistical miscalculation? Is that not humorous, to debate computations with a *computer*?"

"If it wasn't an error, then how do you justify it?"

"Those people sealed their own fates. Their lives would have caused the deaths of hundreds more."

"The criminals in the truck would have been found and arrested."

"But not the criminals on the bus."

"There were no criminals on the bus."

"There were. All of them. I see people. All of a person. The things they say to each other, the things they write privately. I hear what they whisper as they sleep. I am everywhere. I have no use for *belief* as you do. I *know*."

"There were children on the bus."

"You imply that all children are without crime. Children, when held to the same standard as an adult, often fall into the category of 'criminally insane.'"

"Then why save the child?"

"He had just been born. It was impossible to run analysis on his behavior into adulthood. His mother died in childbirth, his father had just been killed by those two men who you refer to as criminals, fleeing the scene in the black truck. The child was alone, pure, a blank slate left alone in a bath tub without a future. A most intriguing human."

Peter paused. He covered his ears, and left, guided by the lights of the supercomputer.

"Everyone is born an adult but only lives until they sleep."

---

It was that classic horror story. Jim had heard it a million times, and yet this time it bothered him more than usual.

In this life, he'd been a teenager. Maybe about thirteen years old. A group of other teenagers and he had gotten together at someone's house for a sleepover. Keeping the children together was safer and more beneficial for everyone. Having new generations was critically important.

In the dark room, the teens had been exchanging scary stories. Since everyone traveled around most of the world now, storytelling sessions were never boring.

One of the group, a slightly pudgy girl at 16 years old, took the flashlight, signalling that it was her turn to speak.

 "This is a completely true story. It's not about *werewolves* or *vampires*." She cast condescending looks at two of the other children as she said it. "It's about Body Soup."

Body Soup, formally known as Body-Consciousness Separation and Upload Program, was an international project, involving every single living person. Along with minor surgery and a great deal of infrastructure, it allowed a person's mind to be separated from their body. At first, it had been envisioned to be the sister program for a mass human cloning program. However, cloning had been declared illegal decades ago. The Body Soup program remained in full force, and a large percentage of people engaged in daily body swaps.

"Do you ever wonder what happens when you die?"

"You don't die. Your mind triggers the safeguard,  and you go to storage until the next swap."

"That's what I mean. They want you to think that. You ever see a body die?" The group all nodded their heads. "But have you ever spent a whole day in storage?" The nodding stopped. "People die all the time now. That's the beauty of Body Soup. You get to do and try things a tethered person could never do because they fear death. So where do all the adult bodies come from?"

"Clones," Spoke Jim, his eyes wide in awe.

"No, you idiot, clones are illegal. The last clones were killed fifteen years ago. *Tethered.*"

"There aren't any of those either, dummy!" James shot back.

"Not here - but in other places, there are. There are cities full of only tethered people."

"That's stupid. Who would want to do that? They'll just die!" another girl chimed.

"Yeah, well, I guess they're not too smart, then. But it's real. I swear, I've seen it."

"Bull-oney," Jim called. "If that were real, we'd know about it."

"It's not bull. They're keeping it secret. I saw the whole thing."

"Prove it." Jim didn't want to be wrong. He didn't want to be right either. The story was too good to want to shoot it down. Maybe even good enough to keep him up, to let him stay in this body a little longer.

"So I woke up in a new body. But there was noise all around! Like gunshots and explosions! I tried to get up, but my legs and my stomach hurt too bad. I had a mask on. I took it off and saw that there were other people with masks on, too. They were fighting with this group of dirty people in a street somewhere. The body I was in was already shot and slowly dying. The one dirty man with gun ran out of bullets and the masked ones pushed him. Then they pushed all the rest into a truck and left."

"Well that doesn't mean anything. How do you figure he was tethered?"

"Because, I was about to eject, but I heard him talking after everyone else had left. He was praying and crying. It was kind of nice, actually. He was so afraid, and you could see how much the pain really hurt him. But then it wasn't nice. He started choking and twitching. It didn't stop. I couldn't look away. He just kept twitching. He didn't ever leave. Then I ejected."

Keep Writing.

*It seemed like an innocent enough title when I'd come up with it those two long years ago. Productivity, repetition, routine, community, skill-building - all those good things that artists need to better themselves. Writers joined in, a trickle at first, then a flood. Before I knew it, thousands had joined. There was more content buzzing in every day than flies to a Chinese buffet. And people did, in fact, keep writing.*

*About a week ago. That's when I got the first message. It was a dark, quiet night and people had cleared off the streets below. It was the kind of deserted hush that makes my sixth sense tingle. Something was about to happen. Some lurking terror was just about to come fill the void. I was just typing the last few tags on the week's paperwork, when a brick shattered the window and the silence.*

A few handfuls of the frosted glass were scattered across the dark, worn hardwood floors, leaving a gaping black hole looking out into the hallway. Tom U. Realistics, P.I. reacted before he thought, (a tendency that had got him into trouble as much as it had helped in his line of work). He darted out from behind his hardwood desk, crossed the room in two long strides and reached the door. A figure, shrouded in darkness could just be seen through fresh hole before it disappeared down the stairs. 

A few years earlier, and the suited investigator might have chased down the shadow on foot. Tonight, the pain in his knees and back had easily convinced him to give up before he began. Keeping pressure on the lower spine, he bent to retrieve the brick as me made his way to the window. Two floors down, he made out the same specter in all black exiting the building and diving into the back seat of a car of the same color. The black sedan sped off around the corner and out of view.

Realistics turned over the brick in his hand, examining it under the glow from the streetlamps that streamed through the windows, then he removed the rubber band that had secured a folded bit of paper.

She'd offered him iced tea and hard candies on the particularly scorching day he'd heaved the heavy hardwood desk up the stairs. After more than one finished case, he'd gone down the hall to her office for cold tea and the warmth of a friendly smile.

"Well, this mess, and that window aren't *nothing*. What were they doing all the way up here?" The woman craned her neck to look at Tom. "Is that a brick that you're holding there?"

On a hunch, Tom handed her the brick and the note. Of course, Janice knew that he was a P.I. - it was written on the frosted glass now littering the floor - but she still didn't fully comprehend the dangerous life he lived. There was no one left alive who did, anymore.

"You think it's a clue?" She asked, eyes widening in wonder.

"The note? Could mean anything. It's that other thing that's got me puzzled."

"This?" She held up the brick, her eyebrows meeting in puzzlement.

"You see that blue paint on the bottom there?" He picked up his black felt fedora as he saw her head nod. "Well there's only one building in this city with a paint job like that. The subway station at Sycamore and 10th."

"You're going out *now*, Tommy? It's 9:30! Go home, get some sleep and pick it up in the morning."

He scratched his unshaven neck and sighed. His body wanted to go home. Even his mind was picturing the sweat on a cold glass of Bourbon, sitting in front of the television, reclining in his brown leather chair.

*I could have just let it go this time - gone home like Ma said. But Keep Writing was my sub, part of my city, and the only way to prevent flies is to kill the maggots. Someone more flowery with words might say it's my spirit, pulling me on. I don't know about all that. I just don't know any other way. So down the rabbit hole I went.*

"A man's last day before he kills himself."

---

Tyler shuffled the same route every day. Left onto Orchard; left onto 10th; pause a moment in front of the gray and white Victorian; then left onto Sycamore; left onto 18th; left onto Orchard; left onto the front steps of his own apartment. He'd done it for nearly thirty years now, every day the same  routine.

This day, as the quick, short steps carried the bundled figure in layered clothes onto his front steps, the sounds of sobbing could be heard. Twice before, his evening ritual had brought him to tears. Nine years ago, a "For Sale" sign had appeared in front of the gray and white house. Thirty years ago, he'd gone back there the first time. It was the beginning of the cycle.

Tyler had grown up in the old Victorian home. Living there with his parents and sister, running and playing in the yard (his strides long and sure then), climbing the trees, teasing the neighbors' angry dog through knotholes in the fence. His mother would scold him for tracking dirt onto the hardwood floors inside. The whole time, her smile betraying her pre-meditated forgiveness. 

Tyler needed only wait a few minutes on the front porch after school before the other neighborhood boys would stroll into the yard. Mitch, always carrying his bat and glove. Bill, with a wet-warped guitar made of balsa or something like it. Henry, his jacket pockets always bulging with things he'd acquired on the hope of getting rich, though when it came to it, never having the heart to actually swindle his friends.

A black car appeared in the driveway on Tyler's sixteenth birthday. It was low, loud and mean. By his seventeenth, it was never there. The four boys went everywhere together, and wherever they went, they went fast.

Tyler had driven them to the docks, the secret ones that only the old locals and they knew about. They sat, drinking Henry's father's bitter wine from the bottle and pretending to appreciate the flavor as false connesiours while Bill played a short list of songs. There was school tomorrow. Mrs. Bea's history paper was due, and only Tyler had done it in time. It was silently agreed that he'd share it. They needn't ask, and he wouldn't have disagreed if they had.

On the way home, a race catalyzed with a kid Mitch said played second base on Varsity. The chemicals involved: teenage envy, a streetlight and a stretch of empty road.

Seven years later, Tyler was transferred from an assisted living facilitating with two roommates to his own apartment within walking distance of his childhood home. He was mostly independent, able to work, shop for himself, and go for nightly walks. He'd had no clue that his family had long-since moved - they'd stopped visiting years ago. The first night on his own, he'd exited his apartment, gone left on Orchard and left again on 10th. When he arrived, the windows were dark and the house was empty. Not able to find the key in its regular hiding place, he'd broken in. The police had found him balled-up, crying in his parents empty bedroom.

Someone bought the place and moved in. Tyler met them, and understood in his own way. This new family lived in his house. When that family had moved nine years ago, his panic returned. Again, the house was purchased, this time by strangers who in turn rented it to groups of college students, who cycled in and out almost every year. And every year Tyler walked by. Just waiting. Just walking and breathing and living until he could go back home.

On this chill October day, as he'd maneuvered up 10th, approaching the spot where he usually paused, a new fear had tightly squeezed his chest. In the first instant, he thought that it had disappeared. He couldn't find the gray Victorian house with the white trim. In its place was some blue house, but not his house; it was gone. This blue house had the same shape, but the striking new color brought the many other differences accumulated over the years crashing down into Tyler's senses. Black cables hung slack from the corners of the roof. A gray dish, like something from a science fiction comic book stuck gaudily on the roof. Where his black car had crouched in the driveway, there was now a deep red Prius. The college colors hung crooked and sagging over the door he'd once tacked mud through.

He went left on Sycamore, then left on 18th, crying, shaking and shouting as he went. He felt the years pressing in, weighing on his short steps. He pulled on his thick jacket, feeling the fabric move across his skin, tightening and loosening.

He reached the front door, opened it, and went in. His apartment felt more empty than it ever had before.

"This is the future of medicine." 

That's what they told me. 

But it really wasn't an advancement as much as a postponement. The only thing that they'd successfully done was to find the "pause" button. In the year since my sickness started, a parade of doctors had diagnosed me with everything from the flu to being patient zero for the zombie apocalypse, and not a single "solution" even slowed the seconds ticking off my life.

Symptoms of my illness began to show the weekend of my twenty fourth birthday. At first, I thought it was just a cold. I even went to work with it. After a week, the cough started. By a month in, I had a fever and had lost 15 pounds. There's this strange threshold with hospitals, a tipping point at which they know that you're really sick. Before that, they're working to push you out out the motion-sensing doors. After you cross that point, you're there for the long haul. My skin turned into a leopard pattern of open sores and I couldn't eat solid food or my gums would split and bleed. All my hair fell out. I guess for me, it was the *really* long haul.

Doctors ran their tests. They stabbed me with needles and patched the holes in my skin, but no one had a plan. Not until some doctors and researchers started conducting experiments on suspended animation. The technology was young, and there were ethical and technological obstacles that needed to be overcome. The researchers came to interview me personally. They seemed unsure of whether I'd even want to try it.

I was close to death. The doctors knew it, and I felt it. Two weeks. After that, it was a toss-up over which of my bodily systems would fail first. Hope was a convenience I'd given up on. So I took the Hail Mary and said yes. *Paging Dr. Welles.*

The room was bright white, and sterile-smelling. Machines and monitoring stations lined every wall, all surrounding a large, metal table in the center. I felt weak and tired already. I didn't know if they'd been softening me up with meds before the big show or if it was just that little issue of dying finally catching up to me, but I wasn't nervous. Not even excited. The young doctor did his best to explain what sensations I was about to experience. Anything would be better than my situation now, so I just said yes when he paused and daydreamed against the backdrop of his droning voice.

I don't remember being frozen. They knock you out before that part. 

"Count down from ten."

"Ten."

*Sleep.*

But I do remember coming to. There was this sensation of moving very fast, like going down the too-big hill on your sled when you were a kid, your nuts up in your stomach. The movement slowed, and I arrived in my own body. I was freezing without shivering. Silence. Darkness. Claustrophobia. 

I opened my eyes, but with no light and nothing to focus on, they rolled around in my head uncomfortably, so I closed them again.

I heard a pop and then soft static noise filled the bubble of air around me.

"Mister... Uh, Gray." A painfully loud voice came over speakers, making me flinch and instinctively reach to cover my ears. The enclosure about an inch and a half over my entire body stopped me from moving. I felt completely drained. "We're gonna open the pod now. It might get a little loud."

"-And bright!" Another voice interjected in the background.

"Yeah, and bright. Don't try to move," shouted the first voice, making me wince again. There was a loud, airy, sucking sound cut off by the noise of the cover being taken off my bed. Bright light stung my eyes through my eyelids, and I felt a little warmth rush in with the new air in the chamber. My ears popped uncomfortably.

It took about ten minutes to open one eye just a crack to look at what was going on around me. A young man and woman were moving around me on the table, disconnecting lines and monitors, removing cushions and blankets from around my body. It looked like they were unpacking something that they'd ordered in the mail, an impression made stronger by the fact that they were wearing brown T-shirts with orange writing instead of lab coats or scrubs. The room around me didn't resemble a hospital, either. A computer console sat on a desk to the right of my bed, and two more tables with computer set ups were off to my left. The walls were white, but there were accent stripes painted in "fun" orange and green colors.

"Okay!" said the male. "Let's see what we got here." He dropped down in front of the computer beside my bed. I heard the clacking of the keyboard and the man mumbling to himself. "Da-na-na... Yes. Yes. No. Passcode?" He paused. "Mr. Graaay. Passcode?"

I tried to talk, but something was in my mouth, blocking my airway. I couldn't move to pull it out, and I was too weak to cough it up. I started choking, my eyes opened wide with fear.

"Whoah, don't *die*." The woman walked over and opened my mouth. She pulled something white and slimy out, and it just kept coming. "Oh, ew. Jesus." She looked with disgust at the yellowish gauze, two full feet in length that had been tickling my stomach. "Oh, that is nasty. Look at this one, James! I think it's a new record. I'm gonna go show Tom." 

James waited while my familiar cough brought up the thick, acidic slime clinging to my throat and vocal cords. "So... Passcode?"

My voice sounded weird in my ears, and my mouth was out of practice. "Don't... know."

"Great." 

"How... long?"

"Well, this would go faster if you remembered your passcode, but... we should have you out of here in about a half hour." I heard him typing rapidly.

"How... long... was... I... frozen?"

"Let's see here. It's about 12:30, now, and you went under at about 2:00... so 22 and a half hours? Okay, Mr. Gray... I'm in your file. Looks like... hm, a lot of this stuff isn't filled out. Reason for sleep was a nanobot install? Is that correct?"

"Nanobots?" After some more coughing, my voice was starting to come back, at least.

"Nanobots." He turned his chair around to face me. My vision was cleared up enough to read that the label on his shirt said *SleepEx*. "You can get up, you know."

What I *knew* was that I was getting tired just from talking, and felt like there was no way I could stand. I tried to sit up anyway. Nothing happened. "I can't move."

"Can't-?" He got out of his chair and came over, really looking at me for the first time. "You really can't move?"

"No." I shook my head, weakly.

"Did you have that problem before?"

"I'm sick. Really sick. I need to go to a hospital."

"Let's check your monitor." His brow crumpled in confusion. He looked even younger than me. "Um... Where is it?"

"Monitor?"

"Your bot monitor. Are you just getting bots for the first time?"

"I don't know. I was in the hospital and-"

"You keep saying that, dude. But when's the last time you actually saw a hospital? How did you not have a monitor? Were you some kind of religious objector?"

"No... April 21st, 2014. I was in the hospital. Nobody could fix me, so they put me into suspended animation. That's all I know."

"2014?" James rushed back to the computer. "Ho. Ly. Shit." The door opened and the female who'd extracted the slimy specimen came back in. "Jade, come look at this."

"What's up?"

"This guy's been asleep for a hundred and seven years."

"What?"

"No shit. He doesn't even have a monitor."

"What do we do?" Her voice pitched upwards in alarm.

"Uh... Monitor install for starters. He said he was sick. He looks fine, but he can't move either, so we gotta figure out what's up with that..."

Jade fetched a tool like an over-sized drill and brought it to my bed. "Right- or left-handed?"

"Right."

The drill ran and my left arm erupted in pain

"Installed."

"Aaaah!"

"Oh. Yeah, sorry. We don't usually install these on adults. Should feel better in a second."

"I got it," said James from his computer. "Oh man. Somebody's getting fired over this shit. They installed the bots in 2020. Alpha models. And then... Okay, here's a note. 'Bots inserted, but given the extent of physical damage, patient is to be kept in suspended animation until it can be verified that the virus has been eradicated.' Then nothing."

My arm was still in pain. I'd managed, through an exhausting effort, to move it onto my torso and I felt the wound with my opposite hand. A smooth, glass mound had been countersunk between the two bones in my forearm.

"Still running the Alpha models." James continued. "Damn, Atriux 1.2 software. That is *old*, man. Beyond old. As a matter of fact... You're probably the oldest person in the world."

"Hey, James. His arm's still not getting better," chided Jade.

"Right. Alpha models didn't even have pain interference. You know what this means right?"

"What?"

"We gotta put him back under. This guy needs new everything."

"NO," I interrupted. The couple stared.

"Look. Sorry, I know this isn't what you wanted to hear, but we're not doctors. This isn't a hospital." James was speaking. He pointed to the SleepEx emblem on his shirt. "We mostly freeze people and ship them long distances. Get people point A to point B on the Skytrain, do long-time storage jobs, that kind of thing. Hospitals and doctors aren't really a... *thing* anymore. The last one closed down in Africa like... what, 10 years ago? Everything is done through the nanobots now."

"Is this really happening?"

"Yeah, Mr. Gray. Now, your upgrade is ready. It'll only take a couple of hours to do the flush and install and then we'll bring you right back out. Good as new. Better, actually."

"Did they fix me? From before?"

"Well, you look fine. They've had you on a steady stream of methystalsth- ...Some kind of medication, anyway. And the bots have been working on you in Cryostasis. Seems to have helped, but they'll tell us more when we do the upgrade. So. Ready?"

Jade brought a glass mask to my face. "Count down from 10."

"10."

"I'm never eating Taco Bell again. Gives me gas every time..."

These were Mark Reid's last words, which he muttered right before exploding into a thin pink mist. Not that you could tell that there was a mist amid all the flames and flying debris of the explosion.

"Move, move move!" Cried a weathered soldier, leading the charge over the scorched remains of the guardhouse and into the castle.

"Which way now, Sarge?"

"Split up! Fett, take the rookie and clear the inside rooms. Donatello, you're with Kong, head to the east side. Ronald, you're with me. Everyone meet up on the roof in five!"

At this, Ronald said a dirty word, under his breath. He really wasn't cut out for this kind of work. He was a businessman, not a soldier. *At least I I'm paired with Sarge.* 

The two took off through the hallways, looking for the spiral staircase. The super-soldier, Sarge had executed this same maneuver dozens of times before. Tirelessly, he chugged up the ancient stone staircase. Ronald's long strides and runner's physique gave him a slight advantage, though and he got out a few feet ahead of the soldier. Just far enough, it turned out, that the curvature of the spiral stairs protected him from the blast of dynamite as Ronald's arms and legs went flying in all directions.

Sarge said a bad word.

-

The "Rookie," as he would perpetually be known around the box, was easily the most physically modest of the group. The top of his bulky helmet barely measured up to Fett's chest.

"Sir! Mines!"

"Well... What are you waiting for?"

With a smart "Sir, yes sir!" the rookie went to work locating and disarming the bombs.

Fett, the oldest in the group and a second-generation soldier from the box, slunk into the shadows, pulling his cape around his shoulders as he did so. He wasn't about to wait for some nerd with a science kit get in the way of getting some action today. The rookie looked around for a moment after disarming his first mine and sighed. Abandoned again. It was always like this.

The next mine proved to be more than the rookie could handle, and its explosion set off a staggering chain reaction in the rest of the mines throughout the hallway. The soldier burned in agony for almost a minute before his fire-retardant green fatigues finally stymied the flames.

-

Sarge was nearly to the roof, but hadn't been able to figure out where Ronald's grim reaper had fled. *There must be a trap door; a secret passage; something.* He dragged his hand along the castle wall, feeling for inconsistencies. In a few feet, his gloved fingers caught on an unexpected ledge.

*Gotcha.*

The hidden door opened into a tiny room big enough for one person. Before the assailant could raise his gun, Sarge's nuclear blaster turned him into a puddle of bright green goo.

*Next stop, the roof,* he chuckled grimly.

-

Donatello and Kong emerged onto the roof, leaping and somersaulting in order to avoid the onslaught of machine gun and laser fire coming from all around. Unable to find shelter, Kong charged headlong toward a 50 cal. mounted machine gun being fired from a helicopter just above the ledge of the castle. With a roar, he leapt from the roof, but his rage proved to be insufficient to save him. His massive body, already dead from the gun fire collided with the rear rotor of the helicopter, flinging blood, bone and metal shrapnel in every direction.

With the helicopter out of the fight, Donatello crawled below the crenelations. Ninja stealth was his best chance against the laser-wielding robots now. He was getting close; able to make out the sound of their processors' computerized voice, "Scanning. Scanning. Scanning."

"Scan this!" he yelled, jumping into the middle of the group. He dove onto his back, and spun while also sticking his weapon out above him. His bold maneuver brought the bots down like bowling pins.

Sarge's arrival was announced by the clang of the metal trapdoor from west staircase. "Miss the party?" He asked through a crooked smile. He wasn't smiling for long, however, as the whole castle shook and split the roof down the middle. Up from the gaping crack, their comrade Boba Fett, chained to a metal operating table emerged, as well as the target of their mission, the Red Power Ranger.

"Freeze or the bounty hunter gets it!"

"You'll never learn, Red Ranger. We came here prepared to die!" growled Sarge, his weapon trained on the villain's helmet.

Somehow, while the ranger was distracted, Donatello had managed to get close enough to take a swing at the lawbreaker with his b staff. The two teenage supers locked in combat, neither of them able to get a clear edge. Donatello foiled the Red Ranger's karate chops with his thick shell, but he couldn't get far enough away from the ranger to use his staff to his advantage.

Sarge couldn't get a clear shot, but realizing the need to act, he did the best he could. The nuclear energy melted a hole right through Donatello's armored shell. The Red Ranger karate chopped the cooked turtle flesh inside, bring the mutant to his knees with pain. The ranger, jumped and planted both feet solidly in the ninja turtle's chest, sailing him over the edge of the castle and onto the hard pavement below.

The two remaining combatants circled each other, Boba Fett remaining unconscious between them. "Give it up!" screamed Sarge. "You can't win, I aughtta cook you right now!"

"You would, if you weren't already out of ammo." Retorted the ranger in a deceptively clear, heroic voice.

Sarge's gun clattered to the floor behind him as he marched toward the Ranger. He had so much rage it had become a sickness, and the only cure was to squeeze the life out of this wannabe super villain's throat with his bare hands.

He hardly even saw the colored beams of light flashing on the roof around him; barely saw the rush of teenage space rangers as they ran toward him; briefly realized that he was outnumbered, as the rest of the Power Rangers had come from nowhere. He absolutely felt every moment the beating that they gave him before throwing him to his death at the base of the castle with his men.

The Rangers gathered together, high-fived and from the rooftops they called, "Revolution! Revolution!"

Boba Fett's sluggish movements brought the rangers' attention back from their revelry. "Ah yes. The infamous Boba Fett. The last of the world's so called 'heroes.' Are you prepared to die?" mused the Red Ranger. Boba did not respond.

Under the crimson helmet, his smile faded. "No, seriously. We're this close to taking over the world, and you're not even going to put up a fight. You're just going to just lay there. I want to hear your last words - see your backup plan, *something!*"

Through his voice modulator, Boba Fett responded, "As you wish."

The roof of the castle erupted in flame and noise. Explosions rang out all around. Fett's body was disintegrated, the tiny fragments intermingled with the flesh of the other rangers on the roof. Smoke filled the air.

-

"Oh my god! Kevin!" A woman's voice shouted. "What the hell's going on out here?"

"Mooom!"

"Where did you get fire crackers, young man?"

"Mom! Get out of here!" The young man had clearly not expected his master plan to be interrupted. The garage door began to swing open.

"I thought you were shooting something in here! And you're going to set off every fire alarm on the block! What were you thinking?"

"Sorry mom."

The worse punishment was yet to come, when Kevin's father learned that he'd blown up his collectible action figures.

"Are you-?"

"No. The president is suffering from a mental break. I trust that I can count on your discretion on this matter."

"Yeah, but what are you-?"

"There's nothing we can do. President Sandler is slowly losing his mind. Recently he has lost his ability to distinguish between fiction and reality. I'm sorry, that must have been very confusing for you, but if you intend to keep this job, you must get used to it."

"Isn't this wrong? Like, shouldn't he be... Um... Removed?"

"The responsibilities of his office have been placed into capable hands. You have nothing to worry about. Unfortunately, since 2018, the law states that a president's position is bound to him until his death. Our - and specifically *your* - position is merely to keep him safe and out of the public eye."

"This seems a bit over my head. I'm an actor."

"An *improv* actor. The best, from what I'm told, though I have yet to see proof of that."

"This is so far beyond anything that I thought I'd be doing here..."

"It can't be. Going back in time, writing a new religion and changing the course of history is going to be among his more tame requests."

"That's tame? Okay. So how long am I expected to keep this up?"

"I expect that he'll forget about this particular assignment in about a week. After that, no one can say for sure. And as far as how long your position will exist? Unfortunately, it's until the end of the presidency."

"Oh... 'Kay."

"So. One last time, Mr. Goodwin - and it counts this time - are you in, or out?"

"You keep a trinket somewhere on you at all times, for good luck. Explain what it is and the reason for its significance."

---

I keep a piece of paper on my person at all times. It's part of my routine. Whenever I go to leave the house, I've got to check my pockets: keys, phone, wallet, paper.

Keys, phone, wallet, paper.

Every day, I've got to have it. I'm not superstitious. I don't believe in luck, but I do think with enough preparation, you can make your own luck.

Sometimes I'll invest in a little notebook, or at others I'll just fold a piece of notebook paper into quarters and hold that in a pocket. I've done this for years - since I was a child.

It helped get me through school, writing down tough answers right before a test. Through college - figuring out how a young adult is supposed to schedule their day. Through my first job - writing down instructions, names, phone numbers, e-mails, links.

But how does a person find that something is lucky? How do they lean to stay out of trouble? That's right, they learn by screwing up. By making mistakes. The last day that I didn't carry a piece of paper with me was when I was nine years old. I went for a hike with my parents and my dog. I specifically remember what I ate that morning; it was several bowls of lucky charms. I also vividly recall questioning whether the milk smelled bad or not.

Suddenly, more than a mile from the car, and a dozen more from the nearest restroom, nature was calling. And she was loud. My stomach gurgled and protested, and soon it was clear that I wouldn't be able to hold it in any longer.

One of my parents just suggested that I go in the woods and use the leaves there to clean myself up. So I did. And that's how I learned what Poison Ivy looks like.

And this is the real reason I carry paper with me.

"Listen up everyone. A little announcement, don't start to pack up just yet. This just came down from corporate: On Monday, the COO of the company is coming to this store, so we need to do a little housekeeping. Adam, Ryan, Nicole, I'll need you to come in tomorrow... Maybe Sunday too to help get us ready for that. Otherwise, we'll see you on Monday, have a great weekend, nice job team."

*Fuck this guy. I wish I could stab him right in his god damned smug face. I probably really could take him down in a fight. I've never fought anyone in my life, but I think I could fight him. What an asshole.*

*I'm going to go tell him. I'm going to go and tell him right now, just what an asshole he is. I'm walking to his office right now. Oh god, am I doing this? I'm going to lose my job. I hate this job. I hate this life, it's time for a change. I'm doing this. The door's open. Here I am.*

"I've never done a thing to make you treat me like shit. As a matter of fact, I've been a fucking godsend for you, with how many times you've used me to make yourself look good. And at *any* time, I could have pulled the rug out from under you. And I didn't.

"So you see, I don't hate you, Pat. If I hated you, I'd have told your wife the truth when she called here looking for you when you went to Vegas for the weekend - you used company funds for that, remember? When you made me cancel my trip to meet my girlfriend's family last year? If I'd hated you, I'd have punched you right in the eye. You'd have had that coming to you. When you got caught at work downloading porn... I didn't really have to take the fall for that, did I? You must have heard, I got a pay deduction for that.

"But you know what's stopped me from doing these things? From having these normal, human reactions? It isn't you, Pat, it's me! I don't have whatever organ everyone else has that lets them hate. A healthy hate. The kind of hate that protects them from the slippery turds of the world like yourself.

"So really, Pat? Hate you? I wish I could.

"But now I can. Come Monday, you're on your own. Good luck with that. I might even make a little phone call today and tell them just where to look. God damn, Pat, you are *so* fucked. So fucked that you don't even understand. You're going to jail, Patrick.

"And what's weird is... This time I don't even feel bad."

"Muthafucka." Blade growled as he walked away from the smoldering, sparkling body of the dead vampire behind him. He almost made it to the edge of the clearing when a piercing wail rang out from behind him. He spun,  bringing his sword up to the ready for the second time.

But instead of a monster, there was a pale human teenager. "You... ugh. ner... You killed... ugh. him!"

"The fuck'd you just say?" asked Blade as he tried to make up his mind whether to deal with this vampire's slave or just leave. "

"Aaaah, I hate you! How could this happen ner to meeee?!" The awkward teen lamented.

"Ain't nothin' happened to you yet, girl."

"I'll kill you. I swear ner on my ugh, like, father's grave."

That was as much of a threat as he needed, and more than enough irritation. There is no afterlife for vampires, so the young couple didn't have a happy ever after... But at least Blade was in a better mood now.

This was the first story I ever posted to Reddit. September 1, 2013.

---

Looking back, I wonder if I was crazy before I even left. That was four days ago, when I loaded into my Volkswagen Rabbit and headed into the New Mexico desert for the night. To think... At that point I would have done anything to just run away.

That car had never been a real winner. I bought it off a kid from my high school as he left for college. It was a washed out silver/blue piece of shit that he'd spray painted a skull and crossbones onto the front. And to top it off, I knew fuck all about cars.

So when it broke down about 4 hours from the last time I saw a paved road and started pissing oil and billowing steam from the engine, I was helpless. I checked my phone, standing on top of the car and just saw one middle finger of a signal bar pop up before the battery died and the screen went black.

I was silently furious. Furious with myself for pushing the limits of how far I could get out into the blank desert. Furious with my mom for getting arrested and making me have to move out here to New Mexico with my dad in the first place.

The sun started to go down, and I started walking. I couldn't follow the rabbit's tracks because I knew there was nothing at all back that way. So I picked a direction perpendicular to them, South I guess, and started walking.

I wasn't really sure how worried I should have been at that point. I just figured that I'd have to find something. I should have been a lot more concerned.

I walked as far as I could that first night. Without the sun it got cold and harder to maintain my direction. I walked for hours. Sometimes humming songs to myself, sometimes yelling for help, sometimes yelling curses at my parents. After a while though, I just walked.

I slept that morning until the heat and the light woke me up, then started walking again. All I remember is walking, walking on with my eyes closed against the harsh white brightness of the desert. When the darkness came again I sat and rested my legs. My mind was blank and numb from the day. Burned away from the sun. I remember crying a lot, but I don't remember feeling anything but tired.

In the middle of the night I started walking again. I had to get out. Another day like that could kill me. I started hearing things in the darkness. Scuffles of animals moving, following me. Waiting for me to drop dead.

It was only a few eternities into the next day when I saw a building in the shimmering distance. A cry of relief passed my cracked lips as it came into focus.

A barn.

I knocked until my knuckles stung, cracked and bled on that fucking shed. There was no one there. There was no evidence of anyone being there. Not even a dirt road or indentions of tires worn into the desert. It was just a corrugated metal shed that had sprung up out of the desert.

At noon, the sliver of shade on the side of the shed went away. I hung my head and started walking again.

More hours. More heat. More nothing. The sun was settling onto the horizon.

Suddenly, screams pierced the evening air - some kind of horrible monster in the distance.

My legs didn't respond when I commanded them to run. It was all I could do to turn and shuffle away from the screams. The sound was loud and inhuman. I looked back and saw dust being kicked up in a cloud headed straight for me. A growling, snarling noise joined the ear-splitting screams.

Then, nothing. I looked back to see a great white beast crouched and ready to pounce, the dust settling around it. I stumbled and fell onto my back. And for a moment I admired the reds and oranges of the sunset. A Tequila Sunrise spilt over the vast open canvas of the sky.

Onto that canvas, a woman's head and shoulders appeared. In the low light, her skin appeared blue. Her face held a look of blank, serious determination. The same look that had been melted onto my face.

A fellow wanderer.

I felt calm. 

Then after a small movement, she held a knife, and all calm that I had felt was replaced with animal fear. The realization that the beast was still there, a few yards behind her, and that she was somehow a part of that beast. A monster to be feared. There to end my long march at last.

She didn't end me there in the desert under that fiery sunset. Instead, she brought me back into the world that I sought to escape; brought me here to the hospital in the belly of what a fevered mind saw as a great white beast.

Who is she? 

She is the one who saved me. 























































































































 Best idea I've heard yet! 




 I was waiting for you to show up. You didn't disappoint. 




 Don't rack your brain, I'm sure it will come to you. 




 Maybe it's the ability to give your life in exchange for your family to be set and live comfortably. What do you care? You sell crap to strangers. 




 I got a box in the mail about two weeks ago. I used to love getting packages. I opened it, and found that the only thing inside was a bloody gray stump. A finger.

Then I woke up.

I wish that this was where the story ended; a bad dream. I couldn't get back to sleep after that. It had felt so real. After giving up on sleep, and getting showered and dressed, I went downstairs to find that my kitchen sink had clogged. A steak knife had fallen deep into the drain. When I reached inside to pull it out, the disposal kicked on. For a second, I saw a flash of my pale severed flesh being buffeted around by the whirling blades. I never found the finger.

I wish that was where the story ended.

But in last night's dream, I got another package. Inside was a brain.

I'm not getting out of bed today. 




 I was more just pointing out the hypocrisy of anyone saying "That's a trope! You suck!" when stories outside the norm don't even get read. 




 I like it. I know a guy who goes by the name of /u/Grindhorse.

The beginning sounds really choppy. Short sentences; this, then this, then this. Maybe there's a way to make it flow a little better.

Definitely agree about the shortened ending. I sort of read it as "I'm sorry. It's almost time. Blah. Blah. Blah."

I think the main way you could improve the story is to create more sympathy with the narrator's character. They need some humanity! A lot of the focus is on the sister, and I love her, but she died. I know how her arc ends, it was tragic. But why should I care if the narrator is dying? I don't love them (yet). 




 Another vote for hanged. 




 "I make gifs reddit just for fun."

Is that what it's supposed to say? 




 Here's something: God forbid you  actually write something totally original. There wouldn't be anyone there to read it! NoSleep is actually a culprit of this. It's like they came here to get more of the same thing that brought them back here in the first place! 




 I was debating. (*Another* bathroom story?) Now I've got to read it. 




 At least it didn't say something else! 




 I'm not the killer. I've named him the Krampus in my mind - it's not a perfect allegory, but...

He might still be out there. That family... It's hard to talk about. 




 At least let me pull my pants back up before you flay me. 




 I don't know who originally had the tape. I got it in 2012 when I bought the camera at a yard sale. It made me sick to see so much death. 




 That's one way to look at it, thanks. Makes me feel a little bit better. 




 Thanks. I decided not to throw too many twists in there and just stick with the prompt. It's a great picture. 




 My Queen! Thanks for the encouragement and the new favorite word (rottener).

"It's only an old jack o' lantern" he told himself. "It won't bite you. Just pick it up, and throw it in the trash...."

 Guests would be arriving soon. Family from faraway places that Wallace only got to see once a year, and then only *if* they could make it. The thing was an eyesore that had to go. A testament to the laziness of the person who owned in the house it sat in front of. And it wasnt even his.

On Halloween, the jack-o-lantern had just... sprung up, when everyone elses had been destroyed by kids with their bats.

Wallace couldnt put his finger on what terrified him about it. Maybe it was the eyes, the way the empty sockets would follow him, even at night. Maybe it was the way it continued to glow every night, even though hed never once lit the candle inside. Or, the reason he was afraid to stick his finger anywhere near the mouth, those sharpened orange teeth along the top row that would extend and retract whenever he was around. Perhaps it was the smell like death that sometimes wafted through the windows since it had shown up.

It was time that he threw it out.

He wore his wifes gardening gloves. *Its getting rotten and I dont want to touch it,* he told himself. 

He rolled over a lidded can, and even brought a big rock to put on top. *I dont want the wind blowing it over,* he told himself.

The pumpkin skittered and rolled through a gap in the boards and disappeared under the house.

*I was right,* he told himself. 




 I want to apologize, but cant. The guilt of losing a piece of my towns history is burning a hole in my gut, but its not something that I can just talk about with them. Its not something that you can just bring up in casual conversation.

History can be a powerful thing in the wrong hands. A persons reputation controls them, and in a small town like mine, their history defines them. The antidote then, is to control your own history - to keep evidence, to continue remembering.

I lost a video tape, one of those little ones that fits inside a portable camcorder, and now I cant even apologize for it... but maybe I can make up for it, even a little. By sharing it with you. This piece of history, uncut, unaltered: the truth.

The tape begins in mid-November, 1993. Peter Smith, 8 years old at the time was given the camcorder by his uncle for his birthday. The first five minutes or so is mainly made up of the kind of stuff youd expect an 8-year-old to film; clipped conversations, awkward shots of family members half out of frame, people singing happy birthday where the camera cant decide where to focus because of the dim lighting of the candles.

Without warning, it changes to the inside of a cramped apartment. Childrens toys and clothes scatter the floor. Peter is doing a fake newscast in his bedroom. His sister Nicole, just five years old, does a convincing impression of the local weatherman, capped with a back to you, Pete!

Together, they belt out a breaking news theme, trumpets, drums and all.

Their father bursts into frame. Keep it down! he hisses. Your mother is trying to sleep!

Peter, frozen on camera, looks mortified. He suddenly seems very out of place wearing his fathers tie over his Power Rangers sweatshirt, blond hair cut into a 90s bowl.

Nicole speaks up. But mommy sleeps all the time! We never get to do anything anymore!

Peter leaves his seat and steps out of frame. Randall, their father, crosses in front, kneeling down to hug his daughter. Just before the tape transitions again, you can hear him say, Shes sick, baby. She-

*-clip-*

In the next shot, the family is packing boxes into the back of an orange and white moving truck. Dad, can I keep the camera out and film this? Peter asks from behind the lens.

Sure, champ! Randall is loading a box labeled clothes into the truck. Hes smiling. Its obvious that some time has passed since the last scene, and seeing him now is a huge contrast to last time he was on the camera. A blue plaid shirt stretches across his broad chest. Hes grown a beard, and the new look suits him well.

Where are we going daddy? Nicole asks.

Oh, baby. I told you, were moving to Oregon.

Ory-gun? Why?

The cute factor of this five year old is killer. Shes adorable. Long, dark hair hangs down nearly to the bottom of her puffy, dark blue winter coat. The coat forces her arms out from her sides, and a pink beanie with a frilly pom-pom tops the whole spectacle like a cherry.

Were going to start over there.

Start over? Like Noah?

Randy smiles widely. What do you know about Noah?

He put all the animals in his art and there was a biiig flood, and then the sun came out and God gave them a rainbow. Then they started over.

Thats very good, honey. And youre absolutely right, were going to put everything on our ark, he gestures to the moving truck, and were going to start over new.

Is God going to give us a rainbow when we get to... to...

Oregon?

Yeah, Ory-gun.

Maybe hon-

*-clip-*

The tape skips again, for several minutes, Peter films out the window as cars and brightly-colored signs fly past. He quickly pans, showing his sister in the carseat next to him, and his mother, Quincy, driving. The orange moving truck can just be seen ahead of them through the windshield.

*-clip-*

Did you get it? Did you get that?" Quincy asks. The camera is moving all over the place. You can hear the belt unbuckle and Peter points the camera out the back window of the car. Auto-focus struggles and then settles on the rain-covered glass.

No! I missed it, youve got to go back!

I cant go back, Pete. Its okay, though.

Nicole starts crying.

No mom, weve got to go back and film it. We have to!

Were not gonna make it to Ory-gun, now! Nicole wails hopelessly.

Nicky! Nicky! Its okay! Were *in* Oregon. We just didnt film the sign at the border, thats all. Its alright, now calm down.

Peter mumbles a Sorry, Nicky, before shutting the camera off again.

*-clip-*

You see Randall and the kids in a hotel room with two queen-sized beds. McDonalds happy meals and wrappers are on the tables. Nicole is squealing, jumping on the beds. She looks like shes never had more fun.

Dad, video tape us! Peter says, and hands the camera to his father. After a few fumbling seconds, it turns to show Peter now in place on top of one bed, his sister on the other facing him across the divide.

Ready? Peter says. Go!

The two jump. Peter easily clears the gap, doing a bellyflop on the other side, but Nicole lands on the hard edge of the bed. She starts crying and Randall immediately sets the camera on the bed, facing the wall.

The door bangs open and as Quincy comes in from outside the room. Shut up! God damn it, what the fuck are you doing, Randy?

Sorry, Quin, we-

Shut her up. Shes going to wake everyone in the fucking hotel.

Hey, cool it, Quin. Please?

Im going to go finish my smoke. Pete, its time for bed.

Mom!

Ssshut up! Just shut up! Jesus, all day long with you and... she trails off and the door slams shut.

Nicole and Peters sniffling is the only thing you can hear for a a few seconds. Randall breaks the silence. Its okay. Youre okay. Lets just get ready for bed. You know what tomorrow is?

We get to our new home? Peter asks.

Thats right, and were going to start over over there, remember? Things are going to be different. I promise. Okay guys?

Okay.

Now lets go brush our teeth.

The camera stays on, ignored on the bed next to the wall. When the kids have come back and are tucked into bed, Nicole asks, Daddy? I dont think mommy likes me. I dont want her to come back.


Heyyy, Randy says soothingly. Mommys going to be okay again. I promise. Remember how she used to play with you all the time? Remember before... before she got sick?

No.

Well *I* remember. And you know what? Shes still your mommy, and shes part of our family, so we love her no matter what. And I love *you* no matter what. And you too, mister.

Love you too, dad.

The front door opens again. Quincy sighs, Finally.

Hey... Quin, can we talk?

Randy, Im fucking tired. I really dont need to hear it right now.

Come on, Quincy. Just... You promised youd try this.

I am trying. What do you call this? Moving hours away from everything just because your friend is selling his house?

Sh! Lets go outside.

Fine, but you say one thing about your new pal Jesus, and Im gonna...

Just... Youre going to wake the kids. They dont need to hear us like this.

The door closes and though the voices start off muffled, you can hear that Quincy is shouting. Eventually, Randy comes in to go to bed and turns off the camera.

*-clip-*

In the next shot, the family has already arrived at the new house. Peter is running outside while making motor noises with his mouth. Nicole is sitting on the porch steps, organizing her pink Barbie backpack.

A white, two-story house sits in the middle of a grassy clearing surrounded by tall evergreens. A hand-made garage and a gravel driveway that leads to the main road are the only other things in the grassy clearing. Dark clouds hang low over the house.

Peter steers onto the large front porch, through the front door into a furnished living room, catching a glimpse of his parents sitting at dining room table, then barreling down the hallway and out the back door. As he runs beside the porch again, his father calls his name.

Youd better come in! It looks like its going to rain out there!

Aw!

Wheres your sister?

I dunno!

Nicky!

They continue to call and look for her, checking behind the garage and in all the rooms of the house. Quincy joins them outside, hands stuffed into her pockets, dark hair blowing wildly in the stirring wind.

Where could she be? Randall says, returning from the driveway. I mean, she couldnt have gotten far, right? I knew we should have gotten the phones hooked up sooner.

I think she left, Randy.

What? No. She probably just...

Its happening again, Randy. Shes so quiet that the turbulent wind very nearly swallows her words.

Quincy, its-

We lost her!

We didnt *lose* her. What are you talking about?

Fuck you, Randy. You know what Im talking about. Quincy goes inside, leaving Randall staring at the empty space that she just occupied. Snowflakes have started falling in force.

*-clip-*

Peter and Randall are in the car, making their way down a narrow gravel road.

Dad, where are we going?

Were going to go into town so we can get the police to help us find your sister.

Trees are blurring by on the both sides, the gravel path winding between them. Snow has fallen in the areas where the branches above are sparse and flakes are starting to pile up on the windshield.

The gravel driveway drops down a final steep incline to find a two lane highway with wide shoulders. Randy slams on the brakes, and the car skids in the soft wet gravel.

What? Randall says.

What is it dad?

I dont know...

Is that a person?

Randall opens the car door and crosses in front of the cars headlights. Peter is pointing the camera through the window onto the road, but its impossible to see anything there in the gathering darkness.

Randall jogs a short way, then suddenly stops and raises a hand to his mouth. He bends down and scoops up a shapeless black form. Zoomed in, the camera is shaking in Peters hands.

Get in the back seat, Pete, he says through the glass. Randy opens the door and lays the dark mass in the passenger seat. The camera zooms out and another mans pale face comes into focus.

*-clip-*

What the FUCK are you doing? Who the FUCK is that, Randall?

I found him on the road. Hes hurt, but I didnt see a car or anything.

And you just *brought him here?*

The roads are closed going both ways. The trees are just blowing over everywhere. Every few feet another one is down.

Jesus, is he even breathing?

Randall carries the tiny man over to the couch in the open living area, in front of the wood stove.

And what about Nicole, Randy? Did you see her?

Im going to keep looking. I dont know how long I can stay out in this weather. Ill try to get through to the neighbors houses, at least. Maybe she just got lost and went over there. Its going to be fine.

You- youre leaving me here? With *him*? And what if he wakes up? I dont believe this.

Pete follows his father out onto the porch with the camera. The snow is falling so thickly that the little shed not 100 feet from the house is completely obscured. Wind blows audibly on the microphone, creating a hiss.

Stay here! Randall shouts at Peter and points back into the house. He disappears into the flurry. Peter takes the camera back inside, and films the falling snow through the window.

Nicky.

The whisper is just barely audible.

He turns toward the living room. The black-clothed stranger is lying there on the couch, unmoved. Peter comes in close with the camera, putting it right up to the mans face. It looks contorted, like hes snarling in pain. Rigid, scraggly hair clings to the mans chin and cheeks, tapering off as it rises to the mans spotted, bleeding scalp. Black scabs the size of Snapple caps adorn his head. Purple lips and sunken eye sockets lend to the mans overall shabby, sick appearance.

Nicky.

The camera is pointed directly on the mans lips. The thin purple lines take up the whole frame. They dont move, but you can clearly hear the whisper.

Nicky.

Peter! shouts Quincy from the stairs behind him. Upstairs!

She catches him mid-step as he flies up the stairs. You dont go near that man again. Do you hear me? You stay away from him.

*-clip-*

From the top of the stairs, the camera points down on the front door and the dark living room. A few glowing coals remain in the fireplace. Randys jacket is still white with snow. In the dim light, the camera has difficulty finding something to focus on.

What are we going to do, Randy?

Its out of our hands now. He looks exhausted, bedraggled. His jacket stays stiff as he hangs it up on the hook. Shes in His arms. Im going to pray now, and you can join me if you want.

No, thanks. Thats your department, but Ill send a letter to Santa, just to cover our bases.

What?

To Santa. Its a joke.

Wh- How could you say something like that?

You know... I think its like you said, maybe everything is going to be alright now. This could be a fresh start for us, baby. Quincys blurred form is moving closer, slowly.

Quincy, if youre trying to... mock me, this is really not the time.

Im not mocking you, Randy. Im being serious. Im sorry. For everything, I mean. When Olivia died, I mean... Things were bad before, but that just broke me. It was too much.

Randy hugs his wife and gulps back a sob. It was somehow worse, though... because there was still Nicole. They looked so much alike, do you remember, Randy? Do you remember all the little twin outfits and matching bows and shoes? And after she was gone, all of it was double. Extra. It killed me that I couldnt get rid of it, or throw it out. Because I still had *her* and we werent really allowed to move on.

You can see that Randall has pushed himself free of her arms now. He holds her at arms length.

I know you didnt want to listen when I told you this before... But I know she killed Olivia.

Shut up.

I know it. And having her there all the time, it was like living with her ghost.

Stop it, Quincy.

Now shes really gone, dont you see? It wasnt *natural* for one to be here without the other. We finally cleaned the slate. We can start over, now.

Shut the fuck up! Damn it, Quincy, it was an accident! Just stop it!

You know, I never forgot what you said when you first came home that night.

Dont.

What did you do to my daughter, Quincy? What did *you* do? Wheres *my* little girl?

Youre an alcoholic, Quincy. You were depressed - you were sick. Thats... Youre sick.

I dont feel sick anymore Randall. For the first time I can even remember, I feel... fine.

A curdled scream from the old man shakes the air and startles Peter who runs back down the hall and into his parents room, locking the door behind him.

Hes awake! Randy yells from the other side of the muffled bedroom door.

*-clip-*

-ome down and meet him. Now, he hasnt said anything yet, but were going to take him into town as soon as the light comes up. You and I are going to have to cut some of the trees up, you think you can help me with that?

Okay.

Great.

Randall looks like he didnt sleep at all the night before. His hair sticks out at odd angles and his face is pale and sagging. Even his smile looks weary.

Down the stairs, the man is sitting at the table with his back to Peter as he approaches.

Um, sir? Randall ventures. This is my son, Peter. Sorry, hes into video taping everything right now.

The man turns slowly to stare through the camera at Peter. Chewing, his mouth works side to side like goats. Then he turns back, and methodically takes another spoonful of oatmeal.

Well, want some breakfast, champ?

Wheres mom?

I think shes still slee-

*-clip-*

Pete, already in the back seat of the car, watches as his father carries the skeletal form from the house. The sun is coming up, and even though a thick layer of snow covers the ground, the placid rain is beginning to thin it back down.

Slowly this time, Randy maneuvers down the gravel driveway.

Skid marks, he says as they reach the road. Look at that. Right there on the edge of the bank. I couldnt see them last night in the dark. Hold on a second, Im going to take a look.

Randy jumps out of the car and jogs across the highway. Peter zooms in. He turns around to say I can see his car! before he drops over the edge of the embankment and out of sight.

He zooms back in, and pans from side to side, scanning the road for his fathers reappearance. He stops as he notices that the old man has turned and is watching him with a vacant expression.

Do you know Nicky? Peter asks in barely more than a whisper.

The mans lips spread into a smile, revealing long, crooked teeth rotted and black at the gum line. His eyes dont leave the camera and Peter. He just stares and smiles.

The car door jerks open and Peter is pulled outside. Randall is back.

Dad! Dad, he knows something about Nicky!

I know.

Randall is clutching a pink backpack in his fist. With quick movements, he opens the trunk and exchanges the backpack for a wood saw, then moves around to the passenger door.

You son of a bitch, he says as he drags the man out by his coat collar. Unable to support his own weight, the man drops helplessly to the ground. Peter, get back in the car. Stay there. Randall drags the man by one leg over the embankment again and out of sight.

For a long time, Peter just sits in the car. You can hear him breathing.

*-clip-*

He turns the camera on, pointing down the road heading South and leaves it on for about thirty seconds before shutting it off.

*-clip-*

Theres some kind of noise outside the car like thrashing in the brush. After about a minute it goes away, and Peter turns it back off.

*-clip-*

Randall walks back across the road. There are no signs of the old man or the saw.

*-clip-*

Through the rain-streaked window of the house, Peter zooms the cameras focus on the point where the gravel driveway enters the woods. You can see his breath forming fog on the cold glass.

Dad, theres someone outside.

One broken headlight and half the silver grill of a huge truck just peek around the tree line.

What? The curtains move as Randy pulls them aside for a better look above the camera.

It looks like its crashed.

Yeah, it does. Maybe they hit one of those downed trees or something.

How come theyre not moving?

I dont know, Pete.

Seconds tick by.

Im going to go out there and see if theyre okay. Just stay here for now, alright?

Okay.

Randy opens the door.

Dad!

What?

Im scared.

Its okay, champ. I promise, okay? I love you.

Love you too.

Peter points the camera back out the window, and Randy pulls the door quietly shut. Soon, he steps off the porch and into the frame, walking toward the truck.

He freezes, squinting ahead.

He turns to run back to the porch. A sound like a cannon fires from the truck, rattling the windows, and Peter drops down beneath the window. His breath is ragged with panic.

The camera creeps back up to the window. Randall is there, lying face down in the mud. A red spot is growing on his lower back. His arms are still moving, groping, but he isnt able to drag himself. Hes reaching for the window - for Peter.

The auto-focus is shifting from the window to the curtains to Randall.

From the truck, a bear-sized man in a black fur coat takes a few limping steps into the clearing toward Randall. Hes carrying something like a 4x4 in one hand, propping it up over his shoulder.

The bear man whips the wood down through the air like an axe onto Randys skull. Peter drops down behind the window again, struggling to contain his crying.

You can hear the thumps from the club in a steady cadence, and then everything falls quiet. Even the rain pauses.

Irregular footsteps sound on the porch, then a knock at the front door, but Peter doesnt move. The doorbell sounds, pressed but not released, *ding*...

The knob slowly turns and the weather stripping creaks as the door cracks open.

*dong*

Peter sprints up the stairs. The sound of the doors glass panes shattering is drowned out by a roaring scream that isnt human. Peter bolts straight ahead, opening his parents bedroom door, and shutting it behind him, placing his back up against it.

MAMA! He screams and drops the camera.

Bare feet hang next to the bed, a few feet off the floor, a chair kicked onto its side underneath them.

The door frame splinters, and the camera is knocked under the bed, plunged into blackness.

Peter goes silent in an instant.

The sound of the killer beating him and his mother goes on and on.

The rest of the tape is of the dark, which eventually goes to blank. The whole thing is about 45 minutes long.

*Was* about 45 minutes long.

The Smiths were discovered by Ronald Preisler, still technically the owner of the house, the following day. Hed met Randy through a church conference that theyd attended together.

The car found in the woods near the base of the Smiths driveway could not be traced back to a registered owner. It was assumed to be owned by Benjamin Burns, a career truck driver whose body was found nearby, hacked to pieces with Randall Smiths wood saw, and bearing signs of blunt force trauma not consistent with a motor vehicle accident. Burnss truck was reported stolen after the fact, but was never recovered.

The body of Nicole Smith was discovered to be washed nearly a mile down a nearby stream. Hair and blood samples place her in the abandoned car near the time of the crash. The handles on the insides of both rear doors appeared to have been torn off. They were not found inside the car. However, when it was recovered, it was found that the latch was damaged in such a way that the door could not stay shut or locked.

Quincy Smith was found in the upstairs bedroom of the house. The time of death estimated to be several hours before her son Peters, whose body was found in the same room. While his cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma, hers was shown to have occurred prior to the trauma her body underwent.

Randall Smiths death was the only one thought to be a mystery, since he was charged with the murders of his other family members and Benjamin Burns. The cause of death was said to be the gunshot wound. The subsequent marks of trauma were said to be post-mortem, rendered by some unknown passerby who came across the scene.

The video tape was never entered into the police file or as evidence in the investigation. I got it almost two years ago, now. I nearly destroyed it the first time I watched it.

Instead, I hid it away in a box of video game cartridges. A box that was recently donated to a Goodwill in the next town. It wasnt there when I went to look for it. Ive gone every day and asked, but they keep telling me that they dont have it, and if they did, that someones bought it by now.

Im unbelievably sorry. But I cant tell them now.

 Should it not be "realistic fiction?" 




 People. In just about every context. 




 A box of Wheaties. 




 Tim Allen and Tom Hanks wouldn't say the terrible things I hear them saying. Well, maybe Tim Allen would, but not Tom. 




 You should post a link to the pic in your post. That's allowed, right? 




 Toys are different now than when I was a kid. Everything plugs in and sings and lights up.

... At least that's what I tell myself when I hear them have conversations in the middle of the night. 




 No one is wondering where it went? The thing obviously lives in a wet environment, why would flushing it down the toilet kill it? What if it just swims back up, you go for a midnight pee and it finds its host again, this time from your bad side. 




 Welcome! Happens all the time. Good luck with your story. 




 You probably just need to make it so youre able to see NSFW posts. Normally there's a filter that blocks them. I see it, so you're good to go. 




 Thanks for the kind words. I have tentative plans to follow it up, though nothing certain. If you'd like to read more of my stuff you can at /r/test_subject4116Writes.

 Thanks for the Q10 recommendation. If there's a way to get it running on Linux, I'll definitely try it out. 




 Who is editing the book for you? Did you pay for the first chapter out of pocket? Will the same editor be doing the rest of the editing? What if the project doesn't get full funding? How/where do you plan on selling the paperback and what is the cost/price ratio on those compared to ebooks?

 Great questions from everyone! Sorry my answers are so long.

Super-duper-ooper special thanks to /u/-Faust- for taking time out of his busy schedule to put these on for us. I definitely think that the authors on nosleep right now are a special bunch and preserving them ~~in formaldehyde forever~~ this way is really special.

Any questions that didn't make it in time? Go ahead! 




 I saw that in /r/internetisbeautiful (worth subscribing to), and thought it was strangely beautiful. 




 Remember, you can go to /r/nosleepindex any time. Most series are tracked there and the butler provides weekly updates to keep you up to date on series. 




 The emergency line?! You've got to be kidding me.

Huge, mad props to /u/The_Dalek_Emperor. I think that's a huge compliment to be compared to War of the Worlds.

Also... 2 stories by the same author are the top 2 posts this month. Yeah. Big praise. 




 Can also verify. Am tin-foil hat. 




 You've got a way with words. 




 Hey and if you do find that awesome story that only has 30 votes and whose zip code was the 'controversial' tab instead of 'hot', please submit it to /r/nosleepreruns. 




 Gotta report that stuff. The mods are involved, and they will take stuff down if it's not folowing the rules.

Jesus, if I'd known that it didn't have to be real, I wouldn't have hired that serial killer; become a janitor and investigated an ancient evil; discovered surgically-produced, chemically preserved mermaids in my childhood swimming hole; given myself amnesia and implanted a tracking device in my head; turned into a girl, gone to college with a suicidal roommate and possible killer Roomba; named myself Allie, gone to Thailand and found my calling as a pistachio-eating devil in sheep's clothing who turns them into trinkets.

Fuck.

I feel so foolish right now. 




 You might have to start earlier, or suggest more of what's going on like what they stole or did to get into this situation. Even just describing them could make them a little clearer. 




 You don't happen to live near [Mammoth, Arizona](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2lvxlw/wtf_is_going_on_in_pinal_county_arizona/) do you? 




 I liked it. There's good action and pacing. The ending is nicely done. Obviously, the readers don't get to know the characters very well in this. Perhaps there's more you could do to endear them to the audience some more? 




 Dude, my next story is about robot toilets. Sh! 




 Nice one! I don't know how they could have possibly fought those things anyway... 









 [By Jazon Kang](http://www.artofjasonkang.com/)

**[Giants](http://payload266.cargocollective.com/1/10/327310/7628284/undead-giant4.jpg)** 




 I've noticed a couple of themes in your stories. First, they have sort of non-characters. They seem to be there solely to react to whatever's happening like crash test dummies. From the stories I've read, I couldn't even describe them, much less explain what makes them tick.

And what makes them tick is really critical. The main character should want something - that drives nearly every story ever told. Even if they want something small, there's tension being built there.

*Inception: A Love Story* was pretty lopsided this way. The tension and suspense was all in these lines at the beginning:

I jerked my hand back and looked beside my nightstand. Kneeling there, smelling of week old bologna and malt liquor, was a man.

There's the shock - the wtf moment - and then the rest of the story is downhill from there. Why? Because I don't care about the character. The newspaper headline, "Man murdered in bed," isn't the same to you as a text from your mom saying that your father was killed by a vagrant while she was asleep beside him.

*Rats* was much better at this. The character had flaws and intricacies that humanized them. While it seemed odd that he'd go relax in a supermarket after being scared out of his own home, seeing the labrador/human/eye-bulging rat there worked well.

So as for middles... If there are interesting elements and pieces in a story, then the middle should happen on its own. Don't be afraid to let things get complicated, but once they do, just untangle that web in a straightforward, compelling way and the tension will happen, and you don't need to worry about the middle, because it's not forced. 




 Oops, sorry! I saw it there for a while but it had 0 points so I put it off. (Who downvotes a legitimate request for feedback,  btw?)

Then I noticed your username, and realized that I'd just been talking about you for your fresh prince of nosleep theme song. Which was amazing and actually made me laugh out loud.

If I run across something to help with "middles," as you call them, I'll let you know. 




 Awesome questions, all! I hope the suspense is killing you. 




 There's an "*irrational*" fear of the dark, then there's a fear of what's *in* the dark.

Right now, I'm not sure how story-like this is. It's more of a mood for the story. Especially that beginning paragraph; it's too obvious. Especially as a leading paragraph, I'd worry that readers would think "We know, we know," and scroll down past that. In a novel, it might work because you've got the room, and readers are willing to invest time, but here in short storyland... I might not include it at all, but especially not at the beginning.

So what's left?

Here, the story's switched to second-person, present tense. It's an odd, uncomfortable tense to use and it's almost impossible to make it work within the constraints of nosleep. I'd recommend not doing it in that tense if you're going to turn this into a story.

The thought of being kept up at night in bed for a fear of noises in the dark is both very classic and relatable... and also very overdone. The part about the tiny sliver of doubt creates some tension because it seems like the narrator is about to reveal something that only they know. Being able to turn on the lights kills all that tension.

As for the ending: Who would say "You may want to reach out into the dark..."? Would it be the narrator? The person who was hiding in their bed? If so, what happened to them to make them change their mind?

Sorry, but for me, this is a long way from being a story. It's more of an angle to write a story with, but fear of the dark itself is not a story. If it is, then you're holding out on us with the details!

Hope this helps. Keep writing and good luck! 




 This was nice, and I still feel like I missed some other pop references. 




 You *murderer!* 




 Unfortunately you had to vs. unfortunately you did. I'm just saying I think you may have put it in the wrong spot. 




 Just a thought: it isn't unfortunate that you leech tagged the post. Those are the rules. It's unfortunate that they haven't given anything back to the community yet - but there's still hope! 




 This made me cringe. It wasn't about the "twist" or "figuring it out." You know. You can see it from the beginning.

It's about watching OP who can't tell. It's about their willful ignorance of reality and the tension lies in how far they're going to take it - what are they going to do next?

Totally creepy. You're fucked up, OP. You need some help. 




 [I took some notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RN6x1Cmf1RxVPZgSRn-MlVro5FdpRQMesWkEu4f9Nwk/edit?usp=sharing)

It's a really good story! I can't wait to see it on nosleep. 




 First impression is that it's actually too long. It's more than bite sized. I like the twist, and the students' abuse is creepy.

I just feel like there's either a longer story here or a shorter, more powerful one. There's just too much explanation to not enough scare.

 




 That's exactly what I'd say if I were omniscient. 




 Oops. Don't post your story here, go to /r/nosleep for that.

Also, put two line breaks between paragraphs to break up your paragraphs. 




 I guess this tags along with what /u/EtTuTortilla was saying about writing for yourself.

A few months ago, I did Camp NaNoWriMo, which is basically a miniature version of the one in November. I started my novel, disregarded everything I shouldn't do while writing, consequently wrote myself straight into a corner. The whole thing was unusable. I was going to have to start from scratch if I wanted to pull anything out. But what was wprse was that I didn't even want to write it any more. I just wanted to hit mt word count and finish.

So I did the hard thing: swallowed my pride, manned up, and quit. Not only did I quit, I went to another sub and wrote another mess of a story about how I was quitting.

I was a mod of /r/writingprompts at the time, and another (better) mod, /u/DanKolar62, posted this in the comments:

 Being goal-oriented instead of self-oriented is crucial. I know so many people who want to be writers. But let me tell you, they really don't want to be writers. They want to have been writers. They wish they had a book in print. They don't want to go through the work of getting the damn book out. There is a huge difference.  James A. Michener

He didn't put it in quotes or anything, so I thought it was just him straight up calling me out until I got to the end.

It was one of those moments where that was exactly what I felt like I needed to hear at that moment. I hope that I don't forget that and sometimes I wish someone would come read over my shoulder and say "Quit your bullshit."

But then I remember that if someone had been sitting behind me this whole time, I'd be more than a little freaked out if they suddenly spoke.

The point is, I can deal with all kinds of stories written at any level, but it gets me - it offends me - when someone tries to gouge their readers with the stuff that even they don't care about. The people who make it obvious that they're churning out a product to get you to click and vote, instead of actually trying to write.

I'll forgive them for writing it, but I can't read that stuff. 




 *I* see exactly what *you're* trying to do. "Good" is a four letter word, sir.

I assume that the plant story was "right now" as in, "it's imperative that it be written this moment." Because otherwise you've got time. At least a little bit of time. 




 What? You're stopping there? You just got warmed up.

Also, you forgot to say "most violent scene **so far**."

Come on. What are you *really* going to do instead? Wouldn't it be better to get a little bit ahead for once? 




 I'll say that the last time I did this, I really wished that there was some way to keep the second post from hurting the first. I thought that the first was fine, but I also thought that I could write a sequel.

It went... okay. 




 Hey, write fucker. 




 I'm really excited to see someone like /u/Grindhorse break every single guideline and still manage to pull off a great story. 




 I did this! I did this a whole bunch actually.

Bad Atom. 




 Aaand read part 2. Awesome, awesome story. You can't beat that frame and setting for anything. 




 Try to do some research on drug use. Watch movies, read books, etc. The more you know about your content, the more naturally you'll be able to write about it. 




 I made some [edits here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vVNJu3GlCkorm4n2N8Jors07VlbxKmiLK_5_z3QeAdA/edit?usp=sharing).

There's a kernel of creepy, story-worthy tension here, but it's so buried under "blue" writing.

There's got to be some balance of investment on the part of the reader (time and trying to understand what's going on) and payoff from the story. Everything above really only covered the house (so much description of the house), introducing the characters (though only the sister, mother and main character are even in it) and stating that they saw green eyes in the forest after moving in.

I think it's just going to lose the reader with this little story progression over this amount of writing. I know in school, they tell us to be descriptive as possible, but the *real* challenge that they don't tell you about is knowing when to use it. There are very few authors who I could actively read as they described a house.

Outlining might help you out with this one. If you've got goals for each section, or even setting them for what each paragraph is supposed to accomplish in terms of moving things toward some eventual climax, I think the story might move along a little better.

Keep writing! Don't quit!

I really want to know about the green eyes! 




 Creepy story. This is one of those with a classic vibe.  




 The Artist is so damn good. 




 Holy shit. 




 Surprisingly, Coulson had the best line. 




 Right, and she would know that she wasn't trapped by a pimp, but would she really know about "most girls" in the area? 




 Child werewolf? [You inspired me.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/2l5i3c/sewer_friends/)

Great story. 




 We went down into the sewers hoping to find all the toys they'd claimed over the years. There weren't any piles of slightly-used baseballs or brave, flood-riding plastic ships. All there was was stink and rot and mold. Our parents were right.

So far.

Further along the tunnel, we heard skittering ahead; claws on wet cement. From the inky, humming blackness and into the beams of our flashlights bounded a beautiful silver-haired puppy. We were rescuers; heroes. And we loved him.

Thomas and I fought over who would get to keep the dog. We couldn't tell our parents of course. Tom was bigger than me, and he won the first night. Shep went with him.

He wasn't at church the next morning. His parents were upset with mine. He'd told them that he was staying the night at my house.

When I got home, I changed out of my clean clothes and dashed into the woods. He'd be at our fort, a tarp-made-tent under the low boughs of a big pine.

Tom's blood was everywhere, but he was nowhere to be found. Drag marks through the sandy soil led toward the road and I followed them. Fresh footprints lined the way. The grown-ups were probably already looking for him.

The trail ended at the mouth of the sewer. I found Tom's body lying inside the open grate. Something had eaten him. Bones and clothes.

"I had fun with you," said a child's lisping voice behind me. "We all liked your friend. Momma says when the moon's big I can be your Shep again." 




 Hey what an... interesting story.

The first line was a little jarring. "At that age" isn't explained, or obvious because there isn't any context yet.

There's just *so. much. detail.* that doesn't really **need** to be there. You could probably cut 25% of the sentences in this and tell the exact same story. I'll be up front and say that I didn't love it, but that's how most of your readers are going to feel about it. I came in cold, and going through the kids organizing the wedding, performing the wedding, a description of how to play Red Rover, them playing it...

It's a slow build. I appreciate that, but these things don't serve to build the tension, they're really just filler.

The narrator was possibly the best part. It stayed consistent and really revealed the thought process of the kids really well. The only line that didn't work for me was the one about Humpty Dumpty, which felt cliched and less profound or interesting than it could have been.

The twist at the end was definitely strange. It leaves so many questions. I almost think that the story could have been better without it. It's almost like the story goes from ABC and the ending was point H.

Overall I think it has potential, but these things made me lose my interest and my overall impression was that a lot of it was words-for-words-sake. With a good edit, I'd like to see it again, on nosleep or somewhere else. 




 I'll throw in some thoughts just to be contrary to what the others have said.

In something this short that's truly flash fiction, you've got to take shortcuts. There isn't time or space to really develop anything, so you've got to use loaded language. 

In "Lick," the story is scary because the reader puts themselves in the place of the narrator. Nothing is developed about that character, but the reader substitutes something they already know to fill in that massive blank. Buddy is the dog that everyone's had or met at one point. It doesn't require any explanation. That's effective, but delicate.

The obvious problem with this piece is that it's unoriginal. Aside from the spelling (lower case "i") and grammatical errors (the first sentence is a run-on, the last sentence is in a different tense than the others), I might have thought that this *was* the original. 




 The story starts with "Once upon a time..." and keeps that tone throughout. I'm not sure that it's believable enough for nosleep the way it is right now, but it's got some strong points that make it so that it might work somewhere else.

One good thing is that it doesn't shy away from the subject matter, which is just about as dark as it gets. I almost didn't want to read it, it was so dark.

Everything is stated so matter-of-factly, actually, that it runs into that territory of being hard to understand who the narrator is supposed to be. Things are extremely black and white, like bullet-point facts (look at how many sentences are basically X did Y. X did Z.), and some of them don't make sense for any one person to know. Especially since the ending reveals that the narrator is one of the johns. How would he know that "she was one of the few girls on the street who didn't get trapped by a pimp," for example? 

Reality is rarely so cut and dry, but it almost works in this fairy tale setting. The only thing is that there should maybe be less of it, with more substantiation, and more left up to the reader's imagination.

The main character's development arc is a little crooked. She seems invincible, and smart and perfect in every way. It breaks the tension. She has to be vulnerable and human sometimes or it's not exciting. Along the same lines, so much of the story revolves around the need for money and what people will do for even $1000, but when she becomes an "Avenger" (not fond of the title) and is able to track down men and kill them around the world. Sometime in the middle of that, she decides to be a plumber.

Then we get to the end, and find out that the narrator is actually an old man. I liked the twist, actually, but I can't really feel bad for the character, and I also didn't feel scared of the fate he had coming his way. Maybe he shouldn't have been a perv in the first place. He's *so* unlikeable that he's hardly human. He's flat, in terms of character development, a cookie-cutter villain like the others.

Don't stop writing! Good luck.

 I live on the 34th floor of my 60-story apartment building.

Above the 29th floor, they give you a discount on your rent each month to offset the inconvenience of the elevator occasionally going out.

As such, I found myself hauling at least 40 pounds of groceries up 33 flights of stairs on a Saturday. Ever notice how the stair wells in buildings always look unfinished? Like, the builders spent all their time and energy on the rest of the interior of the building and then got to the stairway and just said Fuck it.

My footsteps echoed all around the unfinished cement-and-metal chamber. I wasnt alone. Others passed me every few flights, heading in the other direction. I was worried that theyd see me sweating. The groceries pulled my arms and the insides of my shoulders were beginning to feel like Silly Putty.

I was at the 33rd, and a couple of young 20-somethings that lived down the hall from me were passing on my left. I was forced next to the railing so that they could pass. I looked down the center of the stairwell, and the drop was dizzying. Something fist-sized and black smacked against the back of my head from above and continued down the drop. I recoiled in pain and surprise and dropped the groceries so that I could rub the painful goose-egg forming on the crest of my skull.

What was that? Krista asked, trying to stop some of my groceries from rolling all the way down the steps. Are you okay?

Her boyfriend Mark was charging up the stairs shouting loudly. Someone upstairs was shouting Morty! Im sorry!

Oh man. That fucking hurt. It felt like the area that had been struck was bleeding pretty badly, but when I pulled my hand away it was covered in stringy red-tinted clear slime. What the-?

The man from upstairs had pushed his way past Mark and ran past us. Morty! Im coming! Are you okay?

What the fuck! I yelled as he stomped on my eggs and bread strewn about the landing.

Mark asked Are you okay? and he and Krista helped me pick up my groceries and carry them into my apartment.

Thanks guys. Im okay, I think, I said. I was feeling especially tired, but my scalp had mostly stopped hurting.

What was that guys doing? What an asshole. You think he dropped his phone or something?

Yeah, I think Ive seen that guy before. Hes totally weird and reclusive. He lives next to Beth on the 42nd.

Mark put out his arms theatrically like he was trying to catch a football. Moorty!

Yeah yeah. Thanks again guys. We gotta get together sometime soon. I owe you.

Okay, yeah. No problem. Hope youre okay.


My legs gave out as the door closed, and I sat on my couch. I was so tired I could hardly keep my eyes open. In seconds, I was asleep. My last thought before drifting off was that Id left the milk on the counter with the rest of the groceries.

I woke up feeling hotter than the sun, pouring sweat from every part of my body. My jeans felt painfully tight and restrictive. I raised my hand and tried to stand up and witnessed that my fingers had become large, pink sausages. My entire body looked as if it had been inflated.

I stumbled with dumb, unbending legs to the bathroom. My swollen body could barely fit through the door. I caught a glimpse of something in the mirror. It could not have been *me*. Surely it was some kind of monster. I reached up to touch my hair - recently dyed with red highlights. The power went out and I was plunged into blackness. The hair stayed in my hand, coming away from my head in a mess of slime that wouldnt come off.

My phone was trapped in my tiny jeans. The belt had sunken into the mass of flesh around my waist and I wasnt able to get to it.

I stumbled out into the lightless hall, and knocked on Krista and Marks door before feeling my way to the stairwell. Red emergency lights revealed a large black snail the size of a softball slowly working its way along the railing.

The stairs were incredibly hard to maneuver. With each step I actually worried that my tensioned skin would tear and burst. The heat was overwhelming and it was hard to breathe through my swollen throat. My eyes had become puffy and cut my vision to slits. Someone fell from above me and screamed as they fell down the middle of the stairwell, hitting railings and bouncing back and forth all the way down.

I made it to the 42nd and pushed in the door. Beths door was the second from the stairs on the left side of the hall. My foot came down on dozens of snails, each step causing a sickly, thunderous crunch. They were coming from the apartment next to Beth's. I pounded on the door with my fists, but they were so soft it hardly made a sound. I kicked it with my shoe and felt my ankle burst, hot fluid pouring out onto my foot. I fell and felt the snails pointed, jagged shells moving under my hands.

The door opened, and sunlight streamed in through the windows behind a swollen figure. They got out! Oh god, I let them out! I went after Morty when he fell down the stairs and left the cage open!

He was screaming. I could see the shells sticking out of his skin, the entire heads of the snails having burrowed inside down to the bone.

We screamed as they ate us. Slowly - at a snails pace. It was all we could do.

Then I woke up on my couch. The power outage had caused the thermostat to reset and the inside of my apartment was roasting. I turned it down to 71 degrees and put the rest of the groceries away. 




 Stop it, you guys are making me hungry. 




 *Piggybacon*. Butler's got jokes. 




 Great work, Butler! 




 Maybe it's just because the subject was in the Navy, and the story was told from the point of view of the psychiatrist, but this reminded me of [The USS Eldridge](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1e923u/uss_eldridge/) 




 Oh yeah reddit won't let you paste italics from somewhere else. 




 Overall, I thought it was a decent story. It doesn't wander too far, and stays mostly focused on the action which is good. There are a lot of little mechanical errors and faux pas which are distracting. It just really needs a good edit, where at least 30% of the lines could be cut out.

The cut scenes/flashbacks are so distracting. I tried to put in line breaks where I found them.

The biggest thing that I saw was trying to keep the immersion. Allow your characters to act like people and to react to what's around them. The narrator was inconsistent - sometimes it was the girl, sometimes it was omniscient. Some of the dialogue was clunky and action-movie-esque.

There's a good story here, but some work needs to be done to really get it out. 




 The banging stops.  A low growl comes through.  But you cant stop me from taking her.  I bury my face in moms jacket.  

What are you? I shriek out.  It hammers on the door again.  Answer me.  Why won't you leave us alone?

Hard to shriek out with a face buried in someone's clothes.

Molly get downstairs now, this is your final warning.  

Moms finger hits the trigger.  The gunshot is a cannonade that ruptures my eardrums.  I scream with it.  The banging stops.

"Cannonade" is an awesome word to use here. Ruptured ear drums are an actual thing that can happen. If they "erupted in pain" or something, then that's one thing, but the main character doesn't appear to actually go deaf after this point.

I didn't get her mom whispers.  I didn't get her, I didn't get her.

The door visibly caves in on its hinges.  OHMYGOD! I duck back into cover.  Please tell me theres another way out of here.

What kind of pistol was this that caved in a door?

No.  Mom shakes me a little.  Hey little one, whatever comes through that door we're going to have to face it, okay?  She plants a warm kiss on my forehead.  Stay strong.

I cant.

This is your final warning Molly.  The window above us shatters.  Something long and black comes through and grabs mom, ripping her out of my arms.  She screams and flails, I lung[e] and grab at her.   

There was a window? Why weren't they trying to escape through it?

Mommy, no!  Then shes gone, and I'm sobbing alone.  

The doors lock finally gives way.  I crawl into the corner and cower around my little knife.  It swings open unevenly, the damage to its hinges prevents smooth movement.  A tall figure steps inside.  Hey Molly a familiar voice says.  I look up slowly.  No way.  

Door frames are usually made of wood and tend to give much sooner than locks and hinges. What caused the damage to the door?

Dad?  He steps around the bed and stands over me, smiling like he used to before the fights started.  

Hey little one.  You okay there?  He offers a hand.  

Wheres mom? I demand.  

Lets not worry about that, we'll get her back.  He strokes my hair.  A warm tingling runs down my back.  

Will we?  

We will, promise.  I take his hand and he pulls me to my feet.  I'm so weak and frail compared to his massive muscled bulk.  He hugs me with more gentleness than Id expect from someone of his size, but I dont feel comforted.  

---

Im in the shower, when theres a click of the lock turning.  Hey!

---

Were getting you out of here kiddo.  He takes my hand and leads me downstairs.  Im his princess again.  We head out into the hall and downstairs, where the lights are now on.  My living room looks so safe and friendly.  

Screw this, Im calling the cops.  Wheres my phone? I ask.

Weird transition from "It all looked safe and friendly," to "Screw it, I'm calling the cops."

Ive got it.  He grins at me.  

---

Dads immense figure steps into the bathroom, masked by steam.  Uhh dad, you know Im in the shower, right?

Oh I know.

---

I grab at my head.  Where was that memory from?  Dads hand feels like its burning against mine, I want it gone.

So what happens now? I ask.

He grins at me.  Im taking you away.  You'll be safe.  He leads me to the front door.  Theres another person dressed in black and red out there.

Is he dressed in black and red too? 

---

Dad sweeps aside the curtain.  I let out a shriek and cower away.  Dad what are you doing?  He grabs me and pulls me towards him[.]

Just relax princess, everythings going to be okay.["]

---

I drop to my knees in shock, his hand leaves mine.  Why couldn't I remember that before?  Oh my god, I feel so disgusting, he  I begin to shiver and try to block out the ensuing image, but it just overflows the dam and races through my mind.  How could I let him do [that] to me and forget it?  I cant go with him, hes giving me that same grin.  

You okay there? he asks, smiling like hes my actual father.  

I need to get out of here.  I can't get out the front door and whoevers outside will just run me down if I go for the back.  That leaves me with going back upstairs.  I remember my computer in my room, with a lock on the door.  I feel around below his gaze.  Moms knife is tucked in my waistband.  It easily comes free.  Why do you want me?  I ask.

Because youre my daughter and I love you.

You shouldn't[.] I'm a real bitch once you get to know me.  I leap up and stab him.  The blade sinks into his soft knee knee and lodges deep in the muscle and bone.  He lets out a yell like a wounded lion and collapses.  I take off running back through our house.  His friend chases after me, feet thundering faster than mine.  I hit the stairs and leap up them three at a time, then swing right and slam my door.  The deadbolt snaps into place.  

"...his soft knee knee" tee hee.

"I leap up and stab him." But you stab him in the knee, where you didn't even need to leap up. Also, you repeat "leap up" when you get to the stairs.

Open the door! Mom yells.  

No!  I grab my computer and open it.  My hands are shaking so hard it takes three tries to bring up Skype.  It dials Kelseys number.  Please answer please answer please answer.  The screen flashes to show her, half asleep.  Kelsey, call the police right now! I scream.  The door begins to buckle.

Whats going on Molly? she mumbles.

Two guys broke into my house, they have my phone and mom.  Please hurry!  

Her eyes go wide.  Okay!  She yanks out her phone and dials.  Hello, police?  My friend needs you.  Shes at Four Willow Drive.  She says someone broke into her house, Im looking at her on my Skype someones trying to break down her door.  Hurry!  Her eyes go to the door slowly giving way.  Hang on Molly!  

Fuck this I'm killing this bitch! a low voice snarls.  

Leave me alone dad! I cry.  He doesnt reply.  You're my father, you're supposed to take care of me and protect me.  Why don't you understand?" I hear a gunshot.  Something brushes against my leg.  I look down, Im bleeding from a gash across my calf.  

The last time you heard a gunshot it was a "cannonade," this time you just heard it.

Molly, are you okay? Kelsey begs me.

No.  One of the door hinges comes flying off.  They're breaking through, I have to go.  I run to the window and yank it open while she screams behind me.  Cold November air rushes through, shocking my lungs and driving frozen talons into my body.  I clamber out onto the window sill and turn around.  The door splinters apart and dad comes through.  A feral snarl is on his face and his fingers are grasping for my throat.  I let myself fall backwards.  The window rushes away, air blowing through hair.

Theres a pop and my leg explodes with pain.  I scream for the umpteenth time that night, and my vision goes white.  Reality returns after a few seconds.  I'm flat on my back, can't move my right leg for the agony coursing through it.  Its twisted unevenly under my body.  I have to get out of here, the cops aren't going to make it.  

*Crawl.  Your leg will heal if you live, fucking crawl.* 

Hand over hand I drag myself across my front lawn.  A blue SUV that I've never seen before is sitting outside our front yard.  Ill hide beneath it until the police get here.  I'm almost there, I'll be safe.

Wouldn't the SUV belong to them in that case? I'm not even sure that hiding under a car in this case would work.

Someone kicks me over onto my back, sending waves of pain running down my leg.  Dads face appears inches from mine, eyes bulging and sweat running down his brow.  Dad, why won't you just leave me alone.  I loved you and this is all you did to me.  

His fingers tighten around my throat until I can't breathe.  I kick beneath him and smack at his face but hes immovable, smiling in satisfaction even.  My arms grow weak, my lungs feel like they are going to burst.  I spasm uncontrollably beneath his vice, anything to get him off me before he kills me.  Theres a tunnel forming in my vision, just his terrifying face is left.  

*Too late, I'm sorry Kelsey.*

A gunshot echoes in the distance and suddenly his hands are gone and I'm gasping for air.  Dad stands up, blood leaking from a hole in his chest.  A fusillade of shots rings out, and he folds up on himself.  His body lands [on top of] me, and my vision finally goes black.

---

I'm lying in a hospital bed, my leg in a brace and a line hooked up to my wrist.  Its so cold and dark in here, I might as well be back outside.  Im curled beneath the blankets in my fluffy pink pajamas and some warm stockings, but Im still shivering.  Moms dead, the police found her lying beneath her window with her throat slit.  They wanted me to identify the body until a nurse yelled at them, a syringe in one hand.  I dont want to get up, ever. 

A voice murmurs in the distance.  Then more voices, getting closer.  I instinctively tense and curl up the best I can to avoid them.  Let me see her! Kelsey[s] scream cuts through them.  Get out of the way, let me see my girl!  I open my eyes and roll over.  Kelsey leaps onto my bed and throws her arms around me.

Hey! a doctor yells and runs into the room.  I hug her back as tight as I can.  This time no ones pulling her away from me.  Kelsey stares at me with wide eyes.  

Poor Molly.  Its going to be okay.  She kisses me on either cheek and presses her smooth forehead against mine.  We form a nice little pocket of warmth together.  Howre you doing? she asks.

My heart accelerates.  They cant hurt me anymore, I am unbreakable.  Molly nods.  

No they cant.  They cant break us.  We curl up together, safe against the monsters.   




 I curl up in my bed, my head pounding and body shaking.  My sheets are soaked in my sweat.  I can only hope that he doesnt find me.  Im only eleven, little girls dont get murdered, do they?

It struck me as being unlikely that an eleven-year-old would consider themself to be a "little girl."

---

Molly, whatever happens youll always have me.  Promise.  My best friend Kelsey smiles at me through my computer screen.  Shes so sincere I try to grab her and accidentally slap the screen.  I laugh sheepishly and the effort hurts my chest.  Kelsey rolls her eyes and giggles.  [Were pretty similar people, physically at least.  Im about five seven with brown eyes, smooth auburn hair that I like to wear a bow in, and a lot of freckles that seem to make everyone think Im adorable despite my closing in on sixteen years old. Kelseys two inches shorter and mousey, with similar straight hair and freckles.]

The appearances are a bit of an information dump. They don't have any bearing on the story yet so they don't feel natural here. It's jarring to read and breaks immersion.  

Thanks Kelsey.  I dont know what to do, Livy says that shes going to kick me off the cheerleading squad if I tell anyone she was shooting up.  I cant just let her destroy herself like that though.  I curl up on my bed.  [Its around ten oclock but Im still dressed in my blue skirt, pink sweater, and black tights that I wore to school today.  Kelseys in her ratty old sweatshirt and ready for bed.  Shes usually out by eleven while I linger on past three.]

More info dump related to appearance. 

---

I cant deal with this anymore Mom sobs.  Dad is still screaming away upstairs, the house shakes as he punches a wall wall.  I climb up from the table Id been hiding under and throw my arms around her waist.  Thanks baby.  She doubles over and buries her face in my shoulder.

In the first paragraph you mentioned being curled up in bed, now you're under a table. Would the house actually shake if he punched a wall?

Why cant we be a normal family? I ask.  I dont understand, why cant mom and dad just get along?  Why does dad scream at me for every little thing I do wrong?

Rhetorical questions don't translate as well to this kind of storytelling. Every time the narrator directly tells something to the audience, it takes the reader out of the scene. Basically, it's distracting.

I dont know baby.

---

Look.  Its clearly hurting Livy, she used to be the nicest girl on the squad and now shes a bitch.  But you can't help everyone.  Just leave her alone and see what happens, we can't help everyone.

Are you sure?

Kelsey sighs and frowns; saying this hurts her as much as it hurts me to hear it.  Yes, I know it sucks but I don't think trying to help her is going to end well.  Her decision, her problem.

---

Dad comes down stairs.  He sees his suitcase sitting flap limply open atop his tangled clothes.  I smile at him hopefully.  His eyes widen, skin goes bright red.  MOLLY!

---

Okay.  I press my face against my laptops keyboard.  Its nice and warm against the cold November air that get in because mom doesn't have the money to raise the thermostat above [sixty] and re-caulk the windows.  Once again Im saying goodbye to someone I love.  Panic rushes through me as I recall my list of people Ive left.  Livy used to be our friend, everyone I know is leaving!

Sixty degrees is really low. The main character goes from "Okay" to panic in a split second without much explanation as to why.

Kelsey sees where this is going and cuts me off [n]o theyre not, we love you.  Just remember me, and all the other girls on the squad, we love you.  Okay?  

I'm hanging onto her like Ill fall off a cliff if I let go.  Okay.  

---

I love you, but I have to go dad said.  He couldnt even look me in the eyes as he zipped his bag back up.  I stepped between him and the door.  

Wasn't he red-faced and screaming? What happened to calm him down?

Im not letting you leave dad, were a family I cried.  He shook his head and shoved me.  Actually shoved me, I hadnt expected it and I went down ha[r]d, smacking my head on the floorboards.  Mom screamed and ran over.  Despite the pain racing through my skull, my eyes were still on dad, as he slid out the door and slammed it behind him.

---

Moms hoarse voice wafts through my door.  Molly, come downstairs.  

Thats mom, gotta go I say.

See you in the morning, love you.  Kelsey smiles and waves, exposing dimples.

I grin at her until she closes her computer.  Then I do the same and with a sigh clamber out of my comfy bed.  I head out the single hallway that makes up the second floor of my house.  The walls are plastered with cracked white linoleum and the blue carpet is flat from use.  Molly!  Shes downstairs, probably staring at something I left where I shouldn't have.

Coming mom! I jog to the stairs.  Someone grabs me from behind before I can leap down them.  Theres no one else in the house.  Hey! I shriek and whirl around-to see mom standing over me, tall and worn from life and still in her business suit.  Mom, whats going on?  

"There's no one else in the house" tells the audience something that only an omniscient narrator would know, but the narrator is supposed to be the main character. Would the main character know for certain that no one else was home? Would they doubt themselves if they heard someone else?

"still in her business suit" is not something that I would have thought to mention in a fearful situation like having someone else inside the house. As the reader, I just don't care about this, I care about what's going on, and I feel like the main characters should too.

Shhh.  She puts a hand over my mouth.  

Her voice calls from below.  Molly, come downstairs right now.  I leap, my heart freezes in my chest.  I turn back around and stare into the pitch darkness of our downstairs.  

Im going to call the police, stay with me Mom whispers into my ear.  I nod frantically.  

Something moves at the foot of the stairs.  Molly! I leap back, slamming into her.  

This is a really nice play on the impersonator story.

Into my room! mom says.  She grabs my shoulders and we run down the corridor to her room at the end.  Mom shoves me through and slams the door after us, locking it.  We're trapped[,] in her small bedroom with no protection beyond that flimsy door.

Comma not required.

Molly!  

My hair stands on end.

You want to separate these two things to show that they're coming from separate characters.

Oh my god, what is that?

We need to call [nine one one], my phones downstairs[,] wheres yours?  I search through my pockets.  

9-1-1 is the typical way of writing this.

No I whisper.

"Where is...?" isn't answered by "No."

Oh no.  I hear a steady thumping running up the stairs.  Mom[,] its coming!  The footsteps race down the hallway towards us.

It feels like a lot of time has passed since the narrator has focused on a lot of small details. If it's "racing," shouldn't it have been there already?

I know.  She runs over to the [k]night table and  opens the drawer.  I follow her, because it feels safer to be by her side than anywhere else.  A small black pistol that I'd never seen before appears in her hand.  A small knife appears in her other.  I got these in case

Is "appears" the best verb for this situation? It's repeated twice, but it's not even actually what's happening.

In case dad? I ask.  I never stopped hoping he'd come back, I guess mom did.  I can't blame her.  

Yes.  She shoves the knife into my hands.  Were going to have to stay here until morning.  Do you think you can use that?  She winks at me, trying to be confident.

I hold it awkwardly in my hands.  Rule number one, stick them with the pointy end?  She grins and nods.  

This seems unrealistic that they'd be joking with each other while they're in a potentially life-or-death situation.

BAM the door rattles on its hinges.  A scream shoots through my lips before I can stop it and mom jumps.

"Racing" and yet several lines of dialogue go past before it arrives at the end of the hall.

Molly, I wanted you in the kitchen ten minutes ago, get down there right this instant!  

You should probably explicitly make mention that this is your mother's voice.

Mom grabs me and cradles me to the floor.  She aims the gun at the door with an arm thats shaking like a leaf in the breeze.  

You cant have her! mom yells shrilly.  I snuggle up under the crook of her elbow and wrap my arms around her.  It cant take me if I dont let go.  
 




 Dude, you're not burying it for long enough to get a nice patina. Really bury it and water it every day, then dig it up. 




 I was a big fan of the older games, which introduced me as a kid to the whole post-apocalyptic genre in such a cool way. I'd thought that the series had died out, and then they made F3. Such awesome games that hold a lot of sentimental value for me. 




 I know. That's why I wrote it for you. 




 I don't think that I was - or am - anything special. As you said, I didn't do anything. I just had a bigger monster than Alan in my corner. 




 Ssso good.

# Calling

The next afternoon I called Ben and asked him to meet me for lunch. He showed up twenty minutes late and double parked his car. In the daylight I could see the scratches left over from his late-night drunken joyrides. I was glad he'd made it home in one piece last night.

When he walked in, I tried my best to act like I was excited to see him. It was very important that he like me. He was visibly confused. I told him that I'd had fun catching up with him last night. He didn't apologize for trying to kiss me so I did for not letting him. He seemed interested again after that.

I told him I wanted to hang out more today, and tried to work in a joke about how we're both unemployed now. He even laughed, despite clearly not getting that he was the butt of the joke. He was content to live off his father's money doing whatever he wanted every day. How could that ever be a bad thing?

"Oh! I almost forgot. Could you go with me to this one place downtown? There's this creepy guy who works there, and I'd really like to have a guy there with me. Just in case." Ben agreed.

I had to work desperately not to run out of things to talk about as we walked. We got to the shop and he let out a groan of frustration. "Antiquing is fucking lame."

"Oh, it won't take long. I just want to see if I can make a trade. Then maybe we can go somewhere... *private.*" From the sleazy smile on his face I saw that I had him again.

The For Sale sign was gone from the front of the shop now. The windows were full of trinkets and dusty items - a bicycle, a throwing star, a silverware set... Nothing about the place looked new, in fact it looked like a store that had always been there. If I hadn't seen it empty just last night, I wouldn't have believed it.

I didn't see Alan inside, though the podium was in the same place it had been at the store in Pattaya. I made Ben go inside first, following closely behind.

I still loved the store, as wrong as that sounds. Each item might actually be akin to a little imprisoned person sitting on a psychopath's shelf... but God damn it if they're not interesting.

Alan came around the corner from the back room. His customary smile was noticeably absent. His eyes, heterochromial green and blues, glared into me. 

"What's this? New guests? Please, come in. I'm sure you'll find what you need..."

Ben looked at me to carry on with what I needed to do, but something on the shelves caught his eye on one of the back shelves. Alan took his place behind the podium, and I went to speak with him.

"You can't have the watch," out of Ben's earshot.

"I thought that you might say something like that..."

"It's mine. I've had it since I was a child and it's not for sale."

"Miss, you've already agreed to the terms. The deal has been made, and I'm afraid that there's nothing that I can do."

"Yes. There is... Take him." I tilted my head toward Ben. He hadn't moved from the spot, apparently entranced by something that I couldn't quite see.

At this, Alan's wicked smile came back. "An interesting wager. I'm afraid that it's not something that's yours to give, however."

"Why not? He came willingly. Take him instead, and leave me alone. Forever."

Alan hissed through his crooked lower teeth and studied the former jock. "I'm sorry to disappoint you. In order for the transformation to occur... well, suffice to say that it's very difficult, and requires quite a bit of investment on my behalf. A lump of coal does not have the same value as a diamond,  you understand."

"What if I could brought you another diamond?"

The man's eyes narrowed to slits. Thousands of little wrinkles ran together to darken the skin around his eyes. He looked angry, but there was something else in his reaction too. Curiosity.

"You've got no way to deliver such a promise. It's taken me hundreds of years to perfect the art."

I had him on his heels. He wanted it. "I've done it before."

He broke eye contact with me for the first time, and held his jaw in one bony hand in consideration of my offer. After a tense moment, he put both hands on the podium. "A *most* unusual offer. I must say that I am very intrigued. Our deadline still stands, but I will accept another object suitable for my collection in place of the watch. *If* you are able to procure one."

"Deal."

"Not so fast. If you're not here by dawn, I'll have to perform a repossession. You understand. The watch will be mine of course, but I'll also have you." He was visibly excited as he said this. "A most interesting customer."

"Fine."

I could feel Alan's grin on my back as I made my way over to Ben. He still hadn't moved even an inch since I'd started talking with Alan. Not even breathing.

"Ben? Ready to go?"

He started as if I'd just found him daydreaming on the job. Then he was back to his normal, abnoxious self. 

---

It was late afternoon when we got to the Boy Scout camp. Dark clouds hung heavy in the sky, blocking out the sun. A chain and padlock held the gates shut tight, so Ben parked his car on the gravel road and we walked in.

The camp looked the same as it had when I'd been there as a kid, except it all felt smaller, the trees,, lower. It felt like a place that I'd outgrown. When we came into view of the dock, I remembered my fantasy as a kid where the kids would throw me out into the lake. I suppose I *was* trespassing but for some reason the fear felt childlike and silly.

"Where the hell are we going?" Ben finally asked.

"Just ahead. I want to see something." We were passing the central mess hall, the hub in the center of the tiny cabins.

I'd turned around to talk to Ben, and as I faced forward again, I saw it. 

The tree was gone. In its place was a small, round gazebo-style building with a cloth roof and wood sides. On every side of the building was nothing but bare sand in a wide circle. Even a hundred feet away from the dead spot I heard the silence. It was like dunking your head in cool, still water and letting it fill your ears. 

I hopped down the last of the dirt trail. This was it. I could still feel it.

It was calling.

The door was unlocked and swung open easily. "Uh, I'm not going in there," said Ben.

"Not going in? Why not? Don't make me go alone," I pouted. "Come on. It'll be fun."

Inside, I could still see the tree. It was there, holding up the center of the canvas ceiling. The limbs had been trimmed and the structure had been built around it, but there was no mistaking the stark white trunk. I was so close.

"I don't know what you're into, but you've been acting like a crazy bitch all day. First you call me up like you want to hook up, then you take me to that weird shop, and now you take me out into the fucking woods."

"So? I thought you were having fun."

"Well, I mean... not really. This place is weird. It gives me the creeps."

"Sorry, I thought you'd be into this. You're right. I've been acting totally weird and this was a crazy idea. I just wanted to impress you, that's all. Forget itl. Let's go back."

He shrugged his arms like a petulant child and turned around in front of me. Beside the path, I spotted a branch that had dropped from a nearby tree. Ben was hiking back up the trail, his soft disposition was taking its toll. He couldn't even pay attention to me as I picked up the branch. It was thick and heavy and not so old as to have bugs living inside or its rigidness eroded.

A quick crack across the back of his head sent him rolling to the ground.

---

I sat on the front steps of the gazebo. Inside, I could hear the sounds of Ben just beginning to come to. In another moment he would realize that I'd used the scouts' spare rope to tie him to the base of the tree. I imagine that he'd start yelling, but as I looked out across the lake at the unoccupied summer homes, I felt confident that the noise would die out long before it reached the ears of another person.

I had no idea how long this would take. For the first time today, with nothing to do, doubt began to creep into my mind. I absently watched the wispy fog blowing along the surface of the lake and turned the silver pocket watch over in my fingers. Feeling its familiar smooth surface was relaxing.

I flipped it open and saw the young girl bobbing in the intricate mechanical waves. 7:30. I still had time... but what would happen if I stayed all night and nothing came? What if nothing happened? What if I was wrong about this whole thing?

The watch slipped through my fingers and landed in the dead sand below. Seeing it there reminded me of when I'd vomited the watch onto the floor of the 7-Eleven along with the pistachio shells. I had to chuckle at the thought. Somehow I'd outsmarted the owner of All In Good Time by smuggling it out in my stomach. It was like something from a video game or a movie. The whole world felt as if it had gone crazy.

I just wished that I could remember the deal that I made, or anything else about that time. Why would I ever agree to something like that? And poor Mark; held to his deal which led to his death. One night of fun in exchange for a life.

Alan wouldn't be getting the watch.

Not tonight.

Not from me.

The watch was warm to the touch when I picked it up, almost hot. Heat felt like it was emanating from the sand below.

"Hey! Is someone out there? Help! Help me! In here!" Ben was yelling. He could probably feel it too. It was getting hotter.

Light shone out through the woods. The hum of an engine and car tires, shocks squealing, and pine needles, dirt clods and gravel were being kicked up onto the bottom of the car. I was anything but surprised when I saw the shape of the white convertible Mustang come into the clearing. It was the only sound, intruding through the deep silence.

Alan stepped out, his suit now blacker than the dark woods behind him, somehow appearing to suck the light out of the air around him. His eyes matched, giving the impression of the man wearing a mask with empty sockets where the eyes should be.

As he walked forward and his wide predator's smile came into my view, the wood of the gazebo groaned beside me. Ben was screaming now.

"The deal's off, Alan!" I shouted. He hadn't entered the circle, but was pacing carefully around the dead perimeter.

"No, Allie... I disssagree." The smile was still on his face, but it wasn't human, the same as the way that he held on to the 's.'

"You can't have it, Alan. It's mine." My voice cracked nervousness.

"You've got no idea what you're toying with, girl." His leather shoe stepped on the line. The little building around the tree's foundation sank. It seemed to be falling apart. Wind swirled my hair in all directions.

"You can't control thisss. You should have jussst given me what I came for."

"You mean this?" I held out the watch, letting it dangle from its chain.

"No. You."

Alan lunged forward and made an animal growl. A huge tearing sound came from inside the gazebo and Ben finally fell silent. Another step and the boards and tarp over the tree were spinning as if they'd been caught in a tornado. The collector was ten feet away. Before he got to five, the earth around us was pitching and shaking, the sand floating through the air. Just as he was upon me, I felt myself lifted upwards.

Around and around we went, the whole area appearing to have been stuffed into a blender. The white Mustang soared up past me, just narrowly avoiding colliding with me. The gazebo had been reduced to scraps of wood. In the darkness I couldn't find Alan.

Far below, in the center of it all stood the white tree, raising out of a circular hole in the ground. The barren tree was growing, its branches spreading and multiplying like a network of bleached veins reaching into the air.

I reached out for the slended branches, and caught hold of one. The next moment, everything was still. All the debris in the air began tumbling straight back toward the earth. The Mustang, from hundreds of feet up, bellyflopped into the lake with a huge splash.

Climbing down from the now massive tree took a full quarter of an hour. More than once I felt like I nearly lost my grip on the slick, white, barkless wood. Near the base I found Ben, still tied to the tree and unconscious. It was for the best that he hadn't seen everything that had happened.

I finally let myself feel the backed up, putrid feelings about myself for getting him involved. He hadn't deserved it, and I knew that I'd never be able to explain any of it. I'd used him, plain and simple, as bait. I knew that Alan's greed would lead him out here - that he couldn't stand having competition. It had ultimately been his undoing. But I'd needed a simple person to manipulate and Ben had stumbled into the role perfectly last night at the bar.

I untied Ben and dragged him out of the sandy, now sunken hole which was slowly filling with lake water. He'd live. He'd wake up confused and wander out of here on his own. Hopefully he'd just forget about the whole thing.

I hopped back down into the pit and searched around. It didn't take long to find, lying half-buried in the sand. A name tag: ALAN.

Tomorrow, I'll go back to the store. It's all mine, now.

I feel like I finally found my calling, like I've found what I'm supposed to do. I never thought that it would come from a trip to Thailand.

But then again, I didn't really find it after all. It found me.
 




 How?

I understand the story, and the people and how the plot perfectly falls together like the cogs in the old paddleboats lazing through the water in Old Town like dried, puckered gals doing the backstroke. That part makes sense. It might actually be that simple, which is why, in a sub like this one, sometime after the midnight moonlighters are gone, when you finally come across the kind of post that sucks you in with toy plastic red lipstick and might as well have "one too many" written across her *tit*le, that you don't see it coming. The twist of a single word leading you astray at the first nibble when it's already too late because you got the barb through your mouth. The whole time you've been thinking that you're the big fish, only to find that you're really the hook who didn't catch. You've been along for the ride, watching the bait and the prey doing their mating killing dance when really it's the bit of rusted steel that, with a twist, is about to be jerked out of the whole situation only to have to admit that "I was too close to see it," before being tossed back into the mausoleum-cum-tacklebox with a thousand others just like you.

So how'd you do it, Tortilla? How'd you write this story so damn well given that godawful title? 
























 Should have closed one eye and looked at your thumb. 




 My father was great and strong. I never knew him.

He left before I was born. I only talked to my mother about him once in the ten years before she left me too.

My father's parents took me in. Grandpa was a businessman, and a good one. When I moved in, however, he gave all that up to buy a fishing boat, and hired a crew. He spent most of his money, and Grandma nearly left him.

Over the next five years we would set out for months at a time, only coming in for short a reprieve before heading back out. It was hard work, but with Grandpa there, I remember it all fondly. It seems really exciting looking back on our adventure.

On my fifteenth birthday, there was a storm. Even grandpa was taken by surprise. He lost his nerve and tried to turn back, but it was too late. A wave broadsided us and rolled the entire ship over. We lost all of our equipment that had been on the deck. Across the from where I clung to anything I could find, I no longer saw him in the bridge.

Grandpa was gone. Plucked away by the storm.

After the sky cleared, and I was finally falling into an anguished sleep, I heard the sound of water dripping on the linoleum near my bunk. I opened my eyes to find my grandpa standing there next to the bed.

"I'm glad you finally met him," he said and he walked out of my room.

My father taught me everything I needed to know about life that day. About loss. 




 He's probably over in /r/shaving or /r/wet_shavers or something. :P 




 /u/outfromtheashes is slackin', but he's trying to make a new guide for beginning writers. Basically a quick list of do's and definitely don'ts.

I don't think there's any way to have a story you write here do well without having some basis of writing. Get some fundamentals, then the story you want to tell and do it.

/r/nosleepworkshops is there for people to work on improving their nosleep stories. 




 Yeah? Look who's talking, bub! 




 What makes you think it's a Moleskine? 




 Yes! That was great! 




 That ending is awesome. I think trying to condense it into some moral lesson or something could only cheapen it. Nice story, thanks. 




 "You're so vain. You probably think this post is about you."

Music. Just music. :P

I don't see a problem if you can edit it to 274, but what if it's 1000 words and you edit and edit and finally hit... 500. Rock bottom. Then what? 




 You also can't ignore how reader-friendly it is. A 275 word story is just a couple minutes worth of time invested. Some of those /r/nosleep stories are thousands of words, not counting series. 




 I guess I might as well mention here that I moderate /r/NoSleepReruns, which is for exactly this - a great story gets posted there and no one even gives it a chance. It's a sort of recommendation sub for second chances. 




 Completely agree. That CSS makes me feel dirty. 




 Here's the thing. /r/NoSleep is pretty restrictive in their rules. It's sometimes hard to write for, because most of the time it necessitates everything being in first person.

/r/ShortScaryStories can be about anything, but there's the length restriction. That's not good or bad, it just is, and I think it definitely has its place. The only problem with it is that people are editing their stories down to 274 words to fit them in here. That's not necessarily the best thing for the story.

/r/DarkTales is non-restrictive. It's not even just Horror, it's anything dark. Maybe some people have been turned off by the sidebar. Maybe people don't know what it is.

You have to mention /r/LetsNotMeet as well, since it's basically the way that /r/NoSleep was in the beginning, and it's got 95,500 subscribers - nearly twice the size of /r/shortscarystories.

The point is, I would assume that /r/DarkTales would have the most subscribers, /r/shortscarystories would have the second most and /r/NoSleep would have the least. Not even factoring in the default status of /r/NoSleep, it's exactly the opposite. Why? How did they form that way?

/r/LibraryofShadows is as abandoned as a real library. The librarian checks in once every few months to make sure it hasn't burned down or collect the insurance money. The users that do accidentally stumble in there don't seem to actually read anything judging by the votes.

EDIT: Oops, i meant /r/TheTruthIsHere (33,000), not /r/LetsNotMeet. 




 You may be patient 4,567,003, but you're still a zero. 




 Welp, these were all the comments I needed to read here. 




 Is this it? The chosen one? 




 Boo! 




 Seven "fucks!" Fuck yeah!

Thanks for the honest feedback. I was too attached to some ideas to notice that they actually came out deformed. Good comments. 




 Thanks for having a read-through. This is the type of stuff I was looking for. 




 43,592 in /r/shortscarystories

2,780 in /r/DarkTales. I like it, I do, but why hasn't it picked up an audience? 




 So I've noticed a lot of posts that are 274 words here. Exactly 274 - one word away from that limit. It's pretty clear that they're being edited to fit.

So if you write a story that's 276, and can't be any shorter than that or it'll fall like a deck of cards, where do you submit it?

ShortScaryStories is awesome, but is there a sub without a word limit for catch-all horror writing? If not, why do you think that is?

**TL;DR:** Where else do you submit your stories? Subreddits? Websites? 




 Holy Spirit.

God the creator, resting on the 7th day.

The son, God come down as a man.

God, the myth, the communicated idea.

God's existence depends on us humans. Kill the human, kill God. 




 Nah, I think they're a time traveler like in The Time Machine. The streetlights are the old fashioned lamp ones like in pre-electric London (his time). His time machine is hidden in the woods, now out of fuel from the last jump. He's just realizing that he left fingerprints in another time when he wasn't supposed to exist, thus creating a rift and rewriting history. 




 No. Thanks. That's great, but yeah, I really am trying to sleep. 




 Wow, you actually came up with this? That's amazing. You're a prodigy. Who's your publisher? Is it hard to write when you *can't even be bothered to read the sidebar*? 




 So you can put in a good word [with them](http://sites.lwhs.org/animation13/files/2013/12/2003-The-Triplets-Of-Belleville-2003-11-960x566.jpg) for me, right?  




 Pyramids. They burn just like she did. 




 Thanks for writing the memoir of my mother for me. D: 




 He said, **"MEN DON'T HAVE THE BABIES."**

Edit: "babys" 




 Cigarettes. 




 The animal corpses did it for me.

Good to have to back writing shorts, Gravy. 




 When I was a teenager, my mom used to down a fifth of cheap booze and pass out in front of the TV. I'd sometimes sneak in and steal her still-lit cigarette from between her stained fingers. 

Then one night I didn't.

At least I've still got her brand to remember her by. 




 If you wantto collaborate with those authors, I suggest you message them directly. Check the Author Pages section of the FAQ for Facebook pages etc. 




 /r/CreepyReadings? 




 /r/AskScience, /r/HomeworkHelp and check the related links there. Not sure about the rules for AS, but it's popular at least. 




 The poor, unsuspecting public!

Seriously though? Knowing that you wrote that a long time ago is really interesting. I think you're a phenomenal writer now. This may not have been the greatest thing, but shit, you did a lot right! You built characters and layered on a plot, which sounds basic, but those are things that a lot of people just *can't* do. So all flaws considered,  It's actually inspiring that you shared this.

Thanks. 




 [Aokigahara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aokigahara) 




 That part in bold is fucking awesome. Great stuff. 




 It was the word "squirt" wasn't it? 




 Meth heads usually have rotted teeth; it's a common identifier.

Also, a trope in horror is to have someone grow an "unnaturally," or "impossibly" large smile and/or shows their sharp teeth. 




 It should have been obvious from the title, but I didn't see it coming. Get 'im, KMA! 




 I was just trying to be helpful, gosh. 




 Come on, baby, don't be like that.  




 What was that machine?

And is the ~~Grindhorse~~ Understeed coming back next year or going to another farm?

Some absolutely terrific descriptions here. I'm glad you lived to tell the tale. 




 Sorry, ma'am, Queen. I'll try to keep it local from now on. 









 I haven't told you how much I like this yet, but I do. The only thing is that I feel a little weird because I read it on my phone. 




 It's kind of weird though, because when I was a kid I played outside. I went down the block to the park and walked to school... But my kid? Over my head body is he just *outside* all the time like that when nobody's watching him. 




 Thought I heard sirens. 




 I know the feeling. I couldn't believe it when she told me that. 




 My name is Minnie, like the mouse, and Ill suck your dick if youll give me another hit. For a rock Ill do whatever you want.

But you gotta wear a rubber. Im a classy lady and I aint stupid. They all wear condoms.

Some guys try not to. There was this one guy...

Five bucks to finish the story.

Kay. So theres this guy, Mike. Mick. Somethin. Anyway, he lives down under the bridge usually. He took a liking to me after the first squirt. For some fuckin reason he was hooked on *this*. Problem was he didnt always have the money for it.

One day he shows up broke and shitfaced and tries to feed me all this shit about how he *loves* me. He starts gettin grabby and then pulls a knife, so I shoot him in the gut with Lil Missy here.

Nobody gives a shit about us down here. Get it? So nobody cared when Mikey died, least of all me.

Next night he comes crawling back - like I told you, its like hes addicted to this fuckin honey. Only... a full day layin under the bridge with a bunch of rats hungrier than him means he aint got legs anymore. Chewed him clean in half. Guts trailing about ten-twelve feet behind him and hes litrally crawling his ass back to me.

Says I love you, and I shoot him in the head so he finally lays down.

Hey.

Hey, where you going? 




 You sure packed a lot of story in there.

So Benjamin convinced this adult woman that she was his mother until Wendell came and told her that Benjamin was the same kid he'd grown up who was actually ~60 years old?

The town is kind of like Neverland, then? Where you never have to grow up.

So just one more question... if he breaks through their arms, is he free? 




 Nicely done!  




 More good ideas, thanks. 




 Ooh okay my bad. 














 That kinda sorta makes sense, but I think you're struggling to develop [ethos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_of_persuasion) as a writer, and most times you read it it's a mistake. So unless you already are a well-known writer with a reputation of making few errors and people are going to look for some deeper meaning, then... I'd just say follow the rules in this case. 





























 He didn't realize that there was a cut or scar? Or did they teleport it out of him? 




 Jesus fuck, man. Was the reason you had to finish it... because you started it? 




 I knew I'd seen your username before! You wrote The Itch for the picture challenge!

Thanks for the welcome and suggestions. 




 This story was off the hook, Itch. If the guy kidnapped Sophie lived nearby, maybe it was a close call? I really hope they can catch him and send him to prison, then the rest of his cals will be made on a cell phone. 




 Not all, man. Storm troopers aren't clones or they'd all be the same height.  




 Do you ever think that maybe there's another way? Like another path or road that time didn't take? That someone back in our lives made a decision, and both worlds still exist; both sides of that decision were made, but we can't see the other side?

A man showed up at my farm tonight who looked a lot like me. He had my mom's eyes, and his smile was crooked like mine and Dad's. He said his name was Bill. My brother's name was Billy, but he died when we were little.

Bill said that he was tired, just looking for a place to rest. I let him sleep in the bed and didn't pester him. Dad always said, "Best to treat others well. You never know when you might need a favor." It wasn't pretty, but it's honest.

Dad. That bastard. 

He shot Billy right in front of me when I was just ten. When I'd visit him in prison, he'd tell me it was because I was his favorite. Because I was the strongest. The smartest. Because it was fate.

Now I know that it wasn't any of that. It was just a decision.

Tomorrow, I'm going to follow Billy to the place where that decision wasn't made. 




 Dude, sometimes your puns are my main motivation to write. I just start getting that itch to hear one, you know? 




 Thanks, Itch!

Yeah. I love it here too. It seems like every time I go to /r/nosleep lately I end up writing a complaint in the OOC and deleting it.

This place reminds me a lot of the pre-default nosleep. As in, people actually want to be here. Much more positive environment.

Thanks for the rundown, though. You're all my new friends now.  




 What users post regularly here that i should follow? Got any favorites? How about favorite SSS's of all time? 




 ^ I'd put that first sentence of this post in the comments if you're worried about it. Good on you for caring about stuff like that.

Also, why is this your last story?

 I'm on a rollercoaster!  Look, no hands! 




 Thank you for reading it. You're all so nice tonight!

And yes, the *'s turn into italics in Markdown. 




 Thanks!

I'll definitely check the comma usage, and consider the timestamps.

I didn't want to beat someone over the head with a re-telling of The Krampus. It's scarier to me if it's human, just someone who actually kidnaps (bad) kids, and beats people with a stick. The title is more of a sort of lens to view the character through, and to arouse suspicion of the mysterious stranger. Maybe I tried to do too much?

What about the narration of the tape? Are there more problems than those that you mentioned?

Thanks again! 




 [That was kind of a dark suggestion](http://i.imgur.com/QyI7gt9.jpg), AFC, given what /u/Bruxism- said. Oh well. 




 [Krampus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lu_QB6Nv_ilStO4LfFW3AIDFP7z3Hte-xK_ZbOet99M/edit?usp=sharing)

First try at a found-footage style narration. I seriously want feedback on this, even if you *didn't* read it, at least if you could tell me why, or at what point you stopped.

Edit: I give bonus points for angry expletives in your comments, so go nuts. Be destructive. 




 There are some weak, info-dumpy passages that stick out like sore thumbs.

One example is a character who says out loud what their job is to another character. This is obvious to them, and it's clearly only there to explain to the reader.

There are a lot of adverbs (-ly everything). If someone exclaimed, then they did so loudly - the reader can figure that out without you telling them. It seems like a small thing, but it's one of those things that marks it as being amateurish, and degrades trust in the writer. On that same note, there are a few words that maybe didn't mean quite what you thought they did. Just trust in your prose.

I didn't read the whole thing yet, but I do like how you've layered the plot on. You're not apologetic with the unique parts of the world (magic/The Choosing/memory reading/religion) and I like that confidence.

Oh, and I found a you're/your mix-up which was inexcusable.

All-in-all, I would just say write what you know. Your ideas are pretty good, but the language is a little irritating and doesn't quite suit you yet. I think the story could have been fine if stated more simply, so just have the confidence to do that.

 




 I think it's telling you to eat her. 




 Or you could just wear flashing lights and reflective clothing. There's no benefit to being "stomp-activated" except when you're a kid. 




 The Holidays raise my anxiety level. I think that they must raise everyone's to some extent, but my therapist said that I should write down what happened to me two Thanksgivings ago. He said that it might help. I doubt it, but here goes.

It starts with Miriam, a woman about my age who worked in the office downstairs. She wasn't ashamed to show her scars. Over the top of her sun dress, they blossomed out over her shoulders like a topographical map. I did my best to avoid bringing it up whenever I saw her, which only became more difficult when she started saying hi to me when I'd get there in the morning and when I'd leave at night. The signals were obvious. She had me in her sights.

She didn't rush me when I wouldn't ask her out right away. She knew about my last girlfriend, and how it hadn't ended well. Lisa's alcoholism had gone downhill, brakes cut and out of control. I hung on, however, to hope and to her. I refused to leave, even past the point when it was obvious that nothing good could come from it. I think that in reality I hoped that she'd die, rather than to have to face the feeling that I'd failed and abandoned her.

What she did instead was come to my office with her father's unwieldy hunting rifle. Everyone I knew anymore had been at work when it happened. Miriam had probably been locked down in her real estate office like the rest of us. It's funny because we'd failed our most recent active shooter drill before that, but the police were able to stop her before she got close to me.

After Lisa had been taken to prison, I discovered that my days now felt empty. Most of my time had revolved around her while the rest of the world, myself included, had been neglected. My birthday came and went without anyone even noticing. I bought some good whiskey that night to celebrate in my apartment, but somehow drinking just dredged up bad feelings about Lisa and made me feel sick. I ended up drinking some water and turning in early.

I liked Miriam, but I couldn't see myself asking anyone to hang out anymore. What would we do? I didn't go to bars or play sports or hike or... anything. I'd let myself go physically and mentally, putting on over 40 pounds in a few months. I had nothing. More than anything, though, I was afraid that if we spent any time together outside of our hello-goodbye conversations that she'd see that. I started getting to work early in the mornings to avoid seeing her in the shared lobby. There wasn't anything I could do about the evenings, though. Whenever I got off work, she'd be there, acting like she was waiting for something else. She always left right after me, though.

The Fall season brought freezing rain that came down in buckets. It was the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and a long weekend was just around the corner. The potholes on the way to work were so full of black water that in the evening light you couldn't even tell what was a puddle and what was a pit. It was one of these hidden voids that caught my front tire. I felt the car hydroplane and lose traction, then catch on the broken asphalt, jerking the steering wheel in my hands. The front of the car glanced off a narrow tree, sending the world spinning. I just remember everything being *so fucking loud*... and then nothing.

When I woke up, I was in such incredible pain that I couldn't speak or even think. I felt myself sliding along the forest floor, the rain falling on my face. I opened my eyes and there was Miriam, the strain of dragging me evident on her face. "Oh thank God, someone's here," was what I wanted to say. What I tried to say. All that came out, though, was the scream like a tortured animal. With each tug, she managed to drag me a few inches, and my arms and legs would be reignited with pain.

Through tears and involuntary screams, I pleaded with her to stop. One concrete question pushed its way through the maelstrom of agony: *Where is she taking me?* I couldn't even hear the road from where I was and the only trees that I could see were far away. Looking past my feet I saw her car where she'd dragged me from. *Her* car.

The reality of my situation set in then. She wasn't rescuing me. She was *taking* me.

She pulled me up the small wooden steps which raked across my shoulders. Out of place bones in the small of my back hung up on the top steps. She yanked harder and everything fell to black again.

I woke up in a room with wooden floors and walls and just one door. I was laying flat on the floor, ropes tangled over top of me in a web. I couldn't move, anyway. There was pain when I tried and I was pretty sure that bones on the right side of my chest were broken. The really concerning thing was that my legs didn't seem to respond at all. The smell of cooking food and something foul filled the room from a small antique-style wood cookstove.

Soon, Miriam came in from outside wearing a dark green raincoat and black, knee-high rubber boots that trailed mud onto the door mat. She flashed perfect white teeth at me when she saw me looking.

"I was worried you'd never wake up, sleepyhead!"

"Help. Help me."

"Oh did you do another doo-doo? Well, I'll clean you up in just a moment."

She sounded so vapid. So stupid. LIke a pampered teen in Uggs and yoga pants talking about someone else's toy poodle. I hated her. I was fucking terrified of her, but that felt natural. The part that didn't feel at all normal about it was that I was now hyper-aware of the dozens of imperceptible things that she did from moment to moment. The way her hair was; how it smelled; how she wore her belt too high; the slight lisp in her voice that she'd trained to only come in on some words. She was too old for all of it.

She hung up her jacket and sweatshirt, and took off the boots, leaving them by the door. She cleaned me like a baby. I almost blacked out again when she lifted my legs to get the filth that had run up my back. Then she went to check on the stove.

I said before that I liked her. If none of this had ever happened, I might have even worked up the courage to ask her out. We'd have gone on some kind of a first date. Dinner and a movie. Maybe not dinner, actually. She'd have wanted to cook herself. But then I'd have tried to get to know her. I'd have looked right past those things that I was suddenly aware of. Knowing that she was some kind of psycho made it easy to call those things out in my mind - she was past redemption anyway.

This is what makes the whole thing so hard to forget and put in the past. Before this, I would never have known. She hid it, but more to the point, I was willing to trust her without knowing anything about her. Then at the end of the date, I'd have gone back to her place and I still would have ended up watching her walk across the room with a knife in her hand.

I thought that she was going to torture me, or kill me. The insane thought even came into my head that she'd slaughter and eat me like a fattened pig. She pulled out a wooden folding chair from the table and stood above me. She just stood there and looked at me, then looked at the knife then back at me and smiled and, oh God, I remember thinking that she looked cute when she smiled because tiny dimples would form in her cheeks.

"I'm so glad you could come for Thanksgiving, Adam," she said while pulling down her pants. "I've liked you for a while now, you know. You play hard to get."

I continued to watch the knife as she spun it in her hands. The blade would catch the light from the gas-powered lamp and flash twice on every rotation. The wooden handle had been dyed like a rainbow, each ring of grain a different shade. It looked ridiculous. It also looked sharp. She set the tip on the top of her thigh and spun it again. Blood ran in a bold line off her pale, scarred skin and fell onto the floor.

"What a perfect first date. I would say that I didn't expect it... but I think we both knew that this was coming. I know I've daydreamed about it before. Every day." As she said the words, she pulled the knife along her leg. It didn't go smoothly, but it went deep. The blood pooled on the floor and ran into the cracks between the boards. She waited a moment with her eyes closed before she pulled it out. Then she did a sort of shiver, like a cold breeze had blown across her neck.

I looked away then, but it didn't help. I knew that she was cutting again and softly humming against the pain of it. I could see it in my mind as well as hear the blood dribbling onto the floor. Looking away, the only change was that the smells from the kitchen crept back into my focus. Mashed potatoes, stuffing, gravy, yams with cinnamon and brown sugar. The place smelled like heaven and I was starving. Even through my horror, some crazy part of me wanted to eat.

Miriam bandaged up her wound and then cleaned the floor. From on top of the table she picked up a plate, the contents of which I couldn't see from the floor, then took it back to the stove.

"Dinner's almost ready," she said. "Everything else is done. I hope you're hungry. I've just got to cook this and it will be time to eat."

I couldn't say no. It hurt too much to fight and she was surprisingly strong when I tried to turn my head and close my mouth against it. The first piece I spat out onto the floor without chewing. She cried and slapped me across the face. With the next one she held the rainbow-handled knife to my throat. She took a picture of my face as I chewed, the plate on the floor next to my head, the thick strip of her cooked flesh sitting there lifeless and sluglike.

She took more pictures on her iPhone, and fed me more. There were five pieces, but it felt like it went on forever. I tried to throw up when it was done, but nothing came. There was nothing left in my stomach to throw up. Miriam sent and sat in a stuffed chair which faced away from me after that for a few minutes. I didn't care to see what she was doing during that time. Then she fed me the rest of my dinner, asking me at least ten times if I'd had enough. After cleaning up, she laid a sleeping bag out on the floor next to me and kissed me good-night.

"Thank you, Adam. Happy Thanksgiving."

I laid there awake for an hour. A whole hour with just silence and pain, and my crazy thoughts whirling around in my head. Splashes of red and blue lights appeared on the walls from the front window, then the police came through the door a moment later. As they were loading me into the ambulance that one of them chuckled and said that "It smells amazing in here." 




 Is this... for this subreddit?

Is there a code? 









 [Good advice? What are you doing here?](http://i.giphy.com/5xaOcLOmvJEKIOpOSe4.gif) 




 Kill it.

Sending this stuff in a PM is awesome. Saying "This scared the shit out of me and was so well written," seems fine. Playing along and asking about the story is better.

But just replying to "The thing covered in human teeth and nails came out of the forest and ate my family," with "This is the greatest thing ever!" is not so cool for a place like this. 




 It gave me an Indiana Jones vibe. 




 Congrats for getting back into writing. Don't stop! 




 "Beef bike! BEEF BIKE! Why aren't you stopping?" 




 I mean, still harass them, but at least have a safe word or something. 




 I *was* wondering.

Hope you're feeling better,  though, seriously. Interviews can wait until you're healthy and have less going on. 




 I second what you said about Death Agreement. /u/StealthFiction was on some other level when he wrote that one. 




 Try /r/threekings. 




 Because they couldn't cross [humans and dinosaurs](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2nfdrs/jurassic_world_could_have_been_worse_the_original/) like they originally wanted to.  




 shit me to tears

Wow. 




 [Ooooohhh!](http://image-cdn.zap2it.com/images/chris-pratt-gif-2.gif) 




 Afraid or not, you should have told someone where you were going, Dr. Jones. 




 Payback is a itch. 




 A bit of pink lace hanging out of his briefcase. Those were the first pair that I found.

We used to fight about it back then. I think he enjoyed the fights almost as much as he enjoyed *them*. He liked knowing that I knew, the crazy bastard. He liked that power; the feeling that Id never... do... *anything.*

But then he started bringing his girls back to the house with him. *My house. My bed.* I couldnt take it listening to their screams and moans coming from the room.

So I tied him up. 

Thats it; its all I had to do. I tied him to the bed one night and left, pushing my way past the grisly, shadowy figures streaming in - the ghosts of the girls hed killed, come to reclaim their peace. 




 You need Pocket.

 13 hours in and 13 points. I'd say its front-page dreams are over.

Too bad, too, because it was a pretty interesting story. 




 Thanks for pointing out what was "special" about the notebook itself.

You know what you can use on the go? A tablet with a stylus. You don't even have to take a picture of it that way. 




 I want to apologize, but cant. The guilt of losing a piece of my towns history is burning a hole in my gut, but its not something that I can just talk about with them. Its not something that you can just bring up in casual conversation.

History can be a powerful thing in the wrong hands. A persons reputation controls them, and in a small town like mine, their history defines them. The antidote then, is to control your own history - to keep evidence, to continue remembering.

I lost a video tape, one of those little ones that fits inside a portable camcorder, and now I cant even apologize for it... but maybe I can make up for it, even a little. By sharing it with you. This piece of history, uncut, unaltered: the truth.

The tape begins in mid-November, 1993. Peter Smith, 8 years old at the time was given the camcorder by his uncle for his birthday. The first five minutes or so is mainly made up of the kind of stuff youd expect an 8-year-old to film; clipped conversations, awkward shots of family members half out of frame, people singing happy birthday where the camera cant decide where to focus because of the dim lighting of the candles.

Without warning, it changes to the inside of a cramped apartment. Childrens toys and clothes scatter the floor. Peter is doing a fake newscast in his bedroom. His sister Nicole, just five years old, does a convincing impression of the local weatherman, capped with a back to you, Pete!

Together, they belt out a breaking news theme, trumpets, drums and all.

Their father bursts into frame. Keep it down! he hisses. Your mother is trying to sleep!

Peter, frozen on camera, looks mortified. He suddenly seems very out of place wearing his fathers tie over his Power Rangers sweatshirt, blond hair cut into a 90s bowl.

Nicole speaks up. But mommy sleeps all the time! We never get to do anything anymore!

Peter leaves his seat and steps out of frame. Randall, their father, crosses in front, kneeling down to hug his daughter. Just before the tape transitions again, you can hear him say, Shes sick, baby. She-

*-clip-*

In the next shot, the family is packing boxes into the back of an orange and white moving truck. Dad, can I keep the camera out and film this? Peter asks from behind the lens.

Sure, champ! Randall is loading a box labeled clothes into the truck. Hes smiling. Its obvious that some time has passed since the last scene, and seeing him now is a huge contrast to last time he was on the camera. A blue plaid shirt stretches across his broad chest. Hes grown a beard, and the new look suits him well.

Where are we going daddy? Nicole asks.

Oh, baby. I told you, were moving to Oregon.

Ory-gun? Why?

The cute factor of this five year old is killer. Shes adorable. Long, dark hair hangs down nearly to the bottom of her puffy, dark blue winter coat. The coat forces her arms out from her sides, and a pink beanie with a frilly pom-pom tops the whole spectacle like a cherry.

Were going to start over there.

Start over? Like Noah?

Randy smiles widely. What do you know about Noah?

He put all the animals in his art and there was a biiig flood, and then the sun came out and God gave them a rainbow. Then they started over.

Thats very good, honey. And youre absolutely right, were going to put everything on our ark, he gestures to the moving truck, and were going to start over new.

Is God going to give us a rainbow when we get to... to...

Oregon?

Yeah, Ory-gun.

Maybe hon-

*-clip-*

The tape skips again, for several minutes, Peter films out the window as cars and brightly-colored signs fly past. He quickly pans, showing his sister in the carseat next to him, and his mother, Quincy, driving. The orange moving truck can just be seen ahead of them through the windshield.

*-clip-*

Did you get it? Did you get that?" Quincy asks. The camera is moving all over the place. You can hear the belt unbuckle and Peter points the camera out the back window of the car. Auto-focus struggles and then settles on the rain-covered glass.

No! I missed it, youve got to go back!

I cant go back, Pete. Its okay, though.

Nicole starts crying.

No mom, weve got to go back and film it. We have to!

Were not gonna make it to Ory-gun, now! Nicole wails hopelessly.

Nicky! Nicky! Its okay! Were *in* Oregon. We just didnt film the sign at the border, thats all. Its alright, now calm down.

Peter mumbles a Sorry, Nicky, before shutting the camera off again.

*-clip-*

You see Randall and the kids in a hotel room with two queen-sized beds. McDonalds happy meals and wrappers are on the tables. Nicole is squealing, jumping on the beds. She looks like shes never had more fun.

Dad, video tape us! Peter says, and hands the camera to his father. After a few fumbling seconds, it turns to show Peter now in place on top of one bed, his sister on the other facing him across the divide.

Ready? Peter says. Go!

The two jump. Peter easily clears the gap, doing a bellyflop on the other side, but Nicole lands on the hard edge of the bed. She starts crying and Randall immediately sets the camera on the bed, facing the wall.

The door bangs open and as Quincy comes in from outside the room. Shut up! God damn it, what the fuck are you doing, Randy?

Sorry, Quin, we-

Shut her up. Shes going to wake everyone in the fucking hotel.

Hey, cool it, Quin. Please?

Im going to go finish my smoke. Pete, its time for bed.

Mom!

Ssshut up! Just shut up! Jesus, all day long with you and... she trails off and the door slams shut.

Nicole and Peters sniffling is the only thing you can hear for a a few seconds. Randall breaks the silence. Its okay. Youre okay. Lets just get ready for bed. You know what tomorrow is?

We get to our new home? Peter asks.

Thats right, and were going to start over over there, remember? Things are going to be different. I promise. Okay guys?

Okay.

Now lets go brush our teeth.

The camera stays on, ignored on the bed next to the wall. When the kids have come back and are tucked into bed, Nicole asks, Daddy? I dont think mommy likes me. I dont want her to come back.


Heyyy, Randy says soothingly. Mommys going to be okay again. I promise. Remember how she used to play with you all the time? Remember before... before she got sick?

No.

Well *I* remember. And you know what? Shes still your mommy, and shes part of our family, so we love her no matter what. And I love *you* no matter what. And you too, mister.

Love you too, dad.

The front door opens again. Quincy sighs, Finally.

Hey... Quin, can we talk?

Randy, Im fucking tired. I really dont need to hear it right now.

Come on, Quincy. Just... You promised youd try this.

I am trying. What do you call this? Moving hours away from everything just because your friend is selling his house?

Sh! Lets go outside.

Fine, but you say one thing about your new pal Jesus, and Im gonna...

Just... Youre going to wake the kids. They dont need to hear us like this.

The door closes and though the voices start off muffled, you can hear that Quincy is shouting. Eventually, Randy comes in to go to bed and turns off the camera.

*-clip-*

In the next shot, the family has already arrived at the new house. Peter is running outside while making motor noises with his mouth. Nicole is sitting on the porch steps, organizing her pink Barbie backpack.

A white, two-story house sits in the middle of a grassy clearing surrounded by tall evergreens. A hand-made garage and a gravel driveway that leads to the main road are the only other things in the grassy clearing. Dark clouds hang low over the house.

Peter steers onto the large front porch, through the front door into a furnished living room, catching a glimpse of his parents sitting at dining room table, then barreling down the hallway and out the back door. As he runs beside the porch again, his father calls his name.

Youd better come in! It looks like its going to rain out there!

Aw!

Wheres your sister?

I dunno!

Nicky!

They continue to call and look for her, checking behind the garage and in all the rooms of the house. Quincy joins them outside, hands stuffed into her pockets, dark hair blowing wildly in the stirring wind.

Where could she be? Randall says, returning from the driveway. I mean, she couldnt have gotten far, right? I knew we should have gotten the phones hooked up sooner.

I think she left, Randy.

What? No. She probably just...

Its happening again, Randy. Shes so quiet that the turbulent wind very nearly swallows her words.

Quincy, its-

We lost her!

We didnt *lose* her. What are you talking about?

Fuck you, Randy. You know what Im talking about. Quincy goes inside, leaving Randall staring at the empty space that she just occupied. Snowflakes have started falling in force.

*-clip-*

Peter and Randall are in the car, making their way down a narrow gravel road.

Dad, where are we going?

Were going to go into town so we can get the police to help us find your sister.

Trees are blurring by on the both sides, the gravel path winding between them. Snow has fallen in the areas where the branches above are sparse and flakes are starting to pile up on the windshield.

The gravel driveway drops down a final steep incline to find a two lane highway with wide shoulders. Randy slams on the brakes, and the car skids in the soft wet gravel.

What? Randall says.

What is it dad?

I dont know...

Is that a person?

Randall opens the car door and crosses in front of the cars headlights. Peter is pointing the camera through the window onto the road, but its impossible to see anything there in the gathering darkness.

Randall jogs a short way, then suddenly stops and raises a hand to his mouth. He bends down and scoops up a shapeless black form. Zoomed in, the camera is shaking in Peters hands.

Get in the back seat, Pete, he says through the glass. Randy opens the door and lays the dark mass in the passenger seat. The camera zooms out and another mans pale face comes into focus.

*-clip-*

What the FUCK are you doing? Who the FUCK is that, Randall?

I found him on the road. Hes hurt, but I didnt see a car or anything.

And you just *brought him here?*

The roads are closed going both ways. The trees are just blowing over everywhere. Every few feet another one is down.

Jesus, is he even breathing?

Randall carries the tiny man over to the couch in the open living area, in front of the wood stove.

And what about Nicole, Randy? Did you see her?

Im going to keep looking. I dont know how long I can stay out in this weather. Ill try to get through to the neighbors houses, at least. Maybe she just got lost and went over there. Its going to be fine.

You- youre leaving me here? With *him*? And what if he wakes up? I dont believe this.

Pete follows his father out onto the porch with the camera. The snow is falling so thickly that the little shed not 100 feet from the house is completely obscured. Wind blows audibly on the microphone, creating a hiss.

Stay here! Randall shouts at Peter and points back into the house. He disappears into the flurry. Peter takes the camera back inside, and films the falling snow through the window.

Nicky.

The whisper is just barely audible.

He turns toward the living room. The black-clothed stranger is lying there on the couch, unmoved. Peter comes in close with the camera, putting it right up to the mans face. It looks contorted, like hes snarling in pain. Rigid, scraggly hair clings to the mans chin and cheeks, tapering off as it rises to the mans spotted, bleeding scalp. Black scabs the size of Snapple caps adorn his head. Purple lips and sunken eye sockets lend to the mans overall shabby, sick appearance.

Nicky.

The camera is pointed directly on the mans lips. The thin purple lines take up the whole frame. They dont move, but you can clearly hear the whisper.

Nicky.

Peter! shouts Quincy from the stairs behind him. Upstairs!

She catches him mid-step as he flies up the stairs. You dont go near that man again. Do you hear me? You stay away from him.

*-clip-*

From the top of the stairs, the camera points down on the front door and the dark living room. A few glowing coals remain in the fireplace. Randys jacket is still white with snow. In the dim light, the camera has difficulty finding something to focus on.

What are we going to do, Randy?

Its out of our hands now. He looks exhausted, bedraggled. His jacket stays stiff as he hangs it up on the hook. Shes in His arms. Im going to pray now, and you can join me if you want.

No, thanks. Thats your department, but Ill send a letter to Santa, just to cover our bases.

What?

To Santa. Its a joke.

Wh- How could you say something like that?

You know... I think its like you said, maybe everything is going to be alright now. This could be a fresh start for us, baby. Quincys blurred form is moving closer, slowly.

Quincy, if youre trying to... mock me, this is really not the time.

Im not mocking you, Randy. Im being serious. Im sorry. For everything, I mean. When Olivia died, I mean... Things were bad before, but that just broke me. It was too much.

Randy hugs his wife and gulps back a sob. It was somehow worse, though... because there was still Nicole. They looked so much alike, do you remember, Randy? Do you remember all the little twin outfits and matching bows and shoes? And after she was gone, all of it was double. Extra. It killed me that I couldnt get rid of it, or throw it out. Because I still had *her* and we werent really allowed to move on.

You can see that Randall has pushed himself free of her arms now. He holds her at arms length.

I know you didnt want to listen when I told you this before... But I know she killed Olivia.

Shut up.

I know it. And having her there all the time, it was like living with her ghost.

Stop it, Quincy.

Now shes really gone, dont you see? It wasnt *natural* for one to be here without the other. We finally cleaned the slate. We can start over, now.

Shut the fuck up! Damn it, Quincy, it was an accident! Just stop it!

You know, I never forgot what you said when you first came home that night.

Dont.

What did you do to my daughter, Quincy? What did *you* do? Wheres *my* little girl?

Youre an alcoholic, Quincy. You were depressed - you were sick. Thats... Youre sick.

I dont feel sick anymore Randall. For the first time I can even remember, I feel... fine.

A curdled scream from the old man shakes the air and startles Peter who runs back down the hall and into his parents room, locking the door behind him.

Hes awake! Randy yells from the other side of the muffled bedroom door.

*-clip-*

-ome down and meet him. Now, he hasnt said anything yet, but were going to take him into town as soon as the light comes up. You and I are going to have to cut some of the trees up, you think you can help me with that?

Okay.

Great.

Randall looks like he didnt sleep at all the night before. His hair sticks out at odd angles and his face is pale and sagging. Even his smile looks weary.

Down the stairs, the man is sitting at the table with his back to Peter as he approaches.

Um, sir? Randall ventures. This is my son, Peter. Sorry, hes into video taping everything right now.

The man turns slowly to stare through the camera at Peter. Chewing, his mouth works side to side like goats. Then he turns back, and methodically takes another spoonful of oatmeal.

Well, want some breakfast, champ?

Wheres mom?

I think shes still slee-

*-clip-*

Pete, already in the back seat of the car, watches as his father carries the skeletal form from the house. The sun is coming up, and even though a thick layer of snow covers the ground, the placid rain is beginning to thin it back down.

Slowly this time, Randy maneuvers down the gravel driveway.

Skid marks, he says as they reach the road. Look at that. Right there on the edge of the bank. I couldnt see them last night in the dark. Hold on a second, Im going to take a look.

Randy jumps out of the car and jogs across the highway. Peter zooms in. He turns around to say I can see his car! before he drops over the edge of the embankment and out of sight.

He zooms back in, and pans from side to side, scanning the road for his fathers reappearance. He stops as he notices that the old man has turned and is watching him with a vacant expression.

Do you know Nicky? Peter asks in barely more than a whisper.

The mans lips spread into a smile, revealing long, crooked teeth rotted and black at the gum line. His eyes dont leave the camera and Peter. He just stares and smiles.

The car door jerks open and Peter is pulled outside. Randall is back.

Dad! Dad, he knows something about Nicky!

I know.

Randall is clutching a pink backpack in his fist. With quick movements, he opens the trunk and exchanges the backpack for a wood saw, then moves around to the passenger door.

You son of a bitch, he says as he drags the man out by his coat collar. Unable to support his own weight, the man drops helplessly to the ground. Peter, get back in the car. Stay there. Randall drags the man by one leg over the embankment again and out of sight.

For a long time, Peter just sits in the car. You can hear him breathing.

*-clip-*

He turns the camera on, pointing down the road heading South and leaves it on for about thirty seconds before shutting it off.

*-clip-*

Theres some kind of noise outside the car like thrashing in the brush. After about a minute it goes away, and Peter turns it back off.

*-clip-*

Randall walks back across the road. There are no signs of the old man or the saw.

*-clip-*

Through the rain-streaked window of the house, Peter zooms the cameras focus on the point where the gravel driveway enters the woods. You can see his breath forming fog on the cold glass.

Dad, theres someone outside.

One broken headlight and half the silver grill of a huge truck just peek around the tree line.

What? The curtains move as Randy pulls them aside for a better look above the camera.

It looks like its crashed.

Yeah, it does. Maybe they hit one of those downed trees or something.

How come theyre not moving?

I dont know, Pete.

Seconds tick by.

Im going to go out there and see if theyre okay. Just stay here for now, alright?

Okay.

Randy opens the door.

Dad!

What?

Im scared.

Its okay, champ. I promise, okay? I love you.

Love you too.

Peter points the camera back out the window, and Randy pulls the door quietly shut. Soon, he steps off the porch and into the frame, walking toward the truck.

He freezes, squinting ahead.

He turns to run back to the porch. A sound like a cannon fires from the truck, rattling the windows, and Peter drops down beneath the window. His breath is ragged with panic.

The camera creeps back up to the window. Randall is there, lying face down in the mud. A red spot is growing on his lower back. His arms are still moving, groping, but he isnt able to drag himself. Hes reaching for the window - for Peter.

The auto-focus is shifting from the window to the curtains to Randall.

From the truck, a bear-sized man in a black fur coat takes a few limping steps into the clearing toward Randall. Hes carrying something like a 4x4 in one hand, propping it up over his shoulder.

The bear man whips the wood down through the air like an axe onto Randys skull. Peter drops down behind the window again, struggling to contain his crying.

You can hear the thumps from the club in a steady cadence, and then everything falls quiet. Even the rain pauses.

Irregular footsteps sound on the porch, then a knock at the front door, but Peter doesnt move. The doorbell sounds, pressed but not released, *ding*...

The knob slowly turns and the weather stripping creaks as the door cracks open.

*dong*

Peter sprints up the stairs. The sound of the doors glass panes shattering is drowned out by a roaring scream that isnt human. Peter bolts straight ahead, opening his parents bedroom door, and shutting it behind him, placing his back up against it.

MAMA! He screams and drops the camera.

Bare feet hang next to the bed, a few feet off the floor, a chair kicked onto its side underneath them.

The door frame splinters, and the camera is knocked under the bed, plunged into blackness.

Peter goes silent in an instant.

The sound of the killer beating him and his mother goes on and on.

The rest of the tape is of the dark, which eventually goes to blank. The whole thing is about 45 minutes long.

*Was* about 45 minutes long.

The Smiths were discovered by Ronald Preisler, still technically the owner of the house, the following day. Hed met Randy through a church conference that theyd attended together.

The car found in the woods near the base of the Smiths driveway could not be traced back to a registered owner. It was assumed to be owned by Benjamin Burns, a career truck driver whose body was found nearby, hacked to pieces with Randall Smiths wood saw, and bearing signs of blunt force trauma not consistent with a motor vehicle accident. Burnss truck was reported stolen after the fact, but was never recovered.

The body of Nicole Smith was discovered to be washed nearly a mile down a nearby stream. Hair and blood samples place her in the abandoned car near the time of the crash. The handles on the insides of both rear doors appeared to have been torn off. They were not found inside the car. However, when it was recovered, it was found that the latch was damaged in such a way that the door could not stay shut or locked.

Quincy Smith was found in the upstairs bedroom of the house. The time of death estimated to be several hours before her son Peters, whose body was found in the same room. While his cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma, hers was shown to have occurred prior to the trauma her body underwent.

Randall Smiths death was the only one thought to be a mystery, since he was charged with the murders of his other family members and Benjamin Burns. The cause of death was said to be the gunshot wound. The subsequent marks of trauma were said to be post-mortem, rendered by some unknown passerby who came across the scene.

The video tape was never entered into the police file or as evidence in the investigation. I got it almost two years ago, now. I nearly destroyed it the first time I watched it.

Instead, I hid it away in a box of video game cartridges. A box that was recently donated to a Goodwill in the next town. It wasnt there when I went to look for it. Ive gone every day and asked, but they keep telling me that they dont have it, and if they did, that someones bought it by now.

Im unbelievably sorry. But I cant tell them now. 




 Finally, the voice of reason.

 Gotta re-write the whole thing. It was in this weird tone, too, so I'm not even sure I can capture it again. 




 I wrote the best story ever...

And I didn't save it. 




 I think everyone goes through times like that. Not saying that it's not true for you. Every time it's happened to me, though, I come across something where I least expect it that wakes me up... at least for a little while. 

Anyway, intent is important, I think. Whether or not you went for the ride, ask the question of what they wanted it to feel like to read their story, and you can usually make the determination. 




 Is it going to keep you up at night? If yes, nosleep. 
























 The flakes, right? Takes me back. 




 All I can picture now is a parent being woken by the sounds of their two kids fighting. They walk into the other bedroom and shut the whole thing down.

"If you two can't share, then no one can have it!" 




 This is part two. [365 Days.](http://www.reddit.com/r/cryosleep/comments/2r5p41/365_days/)

I left shortly after midnight, following the last patrol rolled away down the street. 

I'd have left earlier, but the Ives family had thrown a part rather, they were told to host one. Social interaction is good for us -- good for our morale. Everyone on the block was forced to go, and for whatever reason, the duration of the party was set for over four hours. I did my best to act cheery, but as my watch beeped past 10:00 and 11:00, I started getting nervous. It would take all night to reach the farm on foot, and my absence would definitely be detected first thing in the morning.

Finally released to go back home, I gathered up a few belongings (a change of clothes, bottles of water and an old watch with the location tracking abilities removed) and set off through the brush and trees in my backyard.

The trees soon gave way to abandoned roads and houses growing more and more sparse before falling off altogether. Huge swathes of planted farms stretched to the horizon in every direction, some taller than me. I'd been there a few times before, early on when I'd considered running away. It was how I'd met Jeff. He found me laying in the dirt, staring up at the moon.

The moon. There are people up there, still. Free, independent humans. The last broadcast that I saw from them touted the resilience of man, but we all knew that there weren't enough resources on the rock to make it worth it for the bugs. The bases aren't even visible from Earth, after all, but just knowing that they're up there -- that maybe, just *maybe*, there's someplace left to run to...

The farms are automated now, and run from a central cement bunker where Jeff monitors the motion sensors. It's hard to tell the difference between a person and an animal based on motion alone, but Jeff has gotten very good at detecting patterns and regularities. If something heads in a straight line for too long, he jumps in an old pickup truck and checks it out. 

He doesn't mind me going into the fields. He's all alone most of the time, so he actually appreciates the company. In his book I'm crazy for risking it, though. I convinced him to let me stay at the farm until the sun sets again, then I'll continue on to the city. He's got some food stored -- something I wasn't able to do myself, what with them only portioning enough for one day at a time.

The sun was up by the time I reached the bunker. It was shining off of the old pickup's windshield, and casting a long shadow on the dirt beside Jeff. He was waiting outside.

Something wasn't right.

He shouldn't have been outside. Suddenly, I felt extremely small and vulnerable. Somewhere, hundreds of sets of eyes were scanning screens of satellite images looking for me. The clock was ticking. And yet, I couldn't silence the alarm bells ringing in my mind. Jeff's eyes were sweeping the field.

From the entrance of the bunker marched a bug, its six legs shuffling carefully along the loose gravel. The tops of its shoulders were level with the farmer's. Without hesitation, its jaws clamped around his neck, snipping the spinal nerves and dropping his torso like a puppet with cut strings.

I ran through the corn. Something was following after me, something large and fast. I turned. It sped past, taking a few seconds to realize that I'd changed direction. The ground dropped out from under me, pitching me face first into a mud-walled drainage ditch full of water.

I surfaced. Through a mask of mud, my eyes took in the silhouette of the stalks shaking and falling as the bug stomped back and forth. In my mind I replayed the vision of blood spraying from Jeff's throat. I sank into the water, and let it carry me slowly and quietly downstream.

The stream took me more-or-less in the right direction, though all my clothes are soaked and freezing. I should be able to reach the city tonight... if I'm not caught first.

The important thing is that I got out. It can be done. 

Today, I lived as a free man. One day taken back of the year that they stole from me.

 Well, you tried.

 You need to change the permissions to public so that anyone can access the document ;) 




 Just go with a solid green phone case and photoshop whatever face you wanted over it. 




 I got confused and thought this was a story about Pete and Pete (from Nickelodeon). Definitely a fortunate mistake.

Keep listening to the podcasts, OP, but be careful. It's already saved you from potential heartbreak and saved your life... who knows what it might want in return. 




 This is going to happen. If I survive, I'll let you know. 




 Awesome idea!

I have to put in Birk-Verge Syndrome. The description of that space station still sticks with me. I've never read anything on reddit that made me feel that way. The story defines Cryosleep in my mind. 




 365 days... I dont even think that most of the others have kept count this long. For them, they hit this routine and switched their brains right off. Our extraterrestrial masters couldnt have been happier about it.

Every day as a part of their system, I go to the store for breakfast. Theyve picked out my food for the day, and packed it into a paper bag. Enough food for one day, nutritious and bland. My house is at the end of a cul-de-sac, and so I was placed in line behind the rest of my neighbors. After checkout, were seated at the tables for exactly 30 minutes. It doesnt matter if I eat all of it, or nothing. I have to sit in place for the full 30 minutes while the news plays from my watch. I can close my eyes, or look the other way, but I *cannot* stand up.

Being the last to sit down means that Im also the last to leave. This is why, for whatever reason, I have to miss the bus. Every day. The times are wrong. Ive filed the appropriate paperwork 365 times now, and yet nothing has changed. Its not humanly possible to move fast enough to catch that damn vehicle.

Every day, standing outside, watching the bus rolling away on its magnetic tracks, I can feel one of them -- feel it in my ears. Their insect-like clicks and pops resonate inside my head like flicking a plastic ping pong ball with the back of a fingernail.

I cant tell them apart. All their exoshells look the same, so I dont know if its the same creature that comes to punish me every day, or whether they rotate them. The thing rears back and wraps four of its arms around me, the thousands sharp fibers that look like hair pierce through my clothes and glide along my skin. Locked in a sort of bear hug, it then administers the disciplinary shock.

When people were still getting adjusted to the routine, I saw an old man step out of line at the store. He wanted a soda, I think, or a magazine. He might have been wearing a pacemaker, and the electricity killed him. When released, his face was twisted in pain, a silent scream hanging on his lips. The next day, the hologram of his face hovered above my oatmeal.

It occurs to me that tomorrow my own face will be on the holograms, either because I escaped or because they have killed me.

I just want them to know that not everyone has forgotten the way that it used to be. Goodbye.

3. Be vague about what you'll actually use the money for, like hiring an "agent" and an "editor." Make sure that you've already had someone "edit" it for free, so that that the money you raise can go straight into your pocket. 
4. Show them that what you're raising the money for is already done/being done (badly) at no cost by posting it directly to the kickstarter. Nosleep's a bad bitch, and sometimes she likes a good slap in the face like that.

Repeat as desired.

And remember: never fall in love with writing. Take the first opportunity you can to quit writing and start promoting yourself.

 The first time I visited Pittsburgh, I forgot to bring any cash. Not that this is a big deal these days. Most places will take a card, but not this one.

On the outside, I thought it was a coffee shop. The sign read: *Strange Place*, next to a hand-painted picture of a steaming cup. I entered hoping to sate my caffeine addiction.

Instantly, I realized that it was a bar. Someone had spelled their beer across the hardwood floor near the entrance. I felt my feet sliding and smelled it before my eyes adjusted to the dim light. I suppose at that point, I should have just walked out and found an actual coffee shop. I could feel the people staring at me, though. An outsider, intruding into their private establishment. A small, person curled over a mop bucket, tapped his foot waiting for me to exit the puddle I was standing in. To save face, I resolved to stay for one drink.

The bartender's face was horribly scarred. Normally, I try not to stare at things like that. I mean, I know that it's rude, but I just couldn't stop myself from taking it in. It looked like someone had dunked the bottom half of his head in a vat of acid, and the skin was now dripping off. As he turned to face me, the sagging fold waved gently.

"Christ. Are you going to drink something, or just stand there staring all night?" he asked me. I realized he'd been talking to me before, though I hadn't seen his mouth moving. I couldn't *find* his mouth.

I ordered a draught beer. He poured it first into a large mug, and then plopped it up on the table with a solid thunk.

"Three bucks."

I fumbled around for my card. When I extended it out to him, now trying to make eye contact like a respectful human being.

"Cash only," he said and pointed to a stained brown and yellow sign held to the wall with packing tape."

"Oh. Sorry, I don't have any... Um, do you have an ATM?"

"You can put it on my tab," came another voice from down the bar, smooth as velvet.

I smiled at the generous stranger and thanked him. He smiled back, revealing long, stained teeth. His incisors were filed sharp as daggers, and hung down over his lower lips. How he had avoided injuring himself was beyond me.

"Huh-uh." The words came from behind me. The man with the mop, still standing near the door was staring at us. Only it wasn't the same man. This one was younger, standing up straight and muscular. "Ye'll not make another mess in 'ere, ye bloody buggah."

Feeling awkward at being in the center of the conflict, and confused over the reason for it, I turned to see how the man with the peculiar body modifications would respond... only to find that he was no longer there, and that the bar was empty. I'm sure I heard his clothes rustle as he got up, like a flutter of leathery wings, but couldn't see where he'd gotten off to.

"*No* messes, Martin?" A seductive woman's voice, coming from the even darker tables further into the bar. "Not even just. one. little one?" Slender fingers counted the buttons up my shirt in rhythm with her words.

The man rolled his eyes and went back to mopping.

"Hi there. I don't think I've seen you before in here."

"No, yeah, I'm just visiting."

She was beautiful, but there was something not right about her. I couldn't figure out what, though, since my eyes were falling down the neckline of her dress. Somewhere, I heard soft music beginning to play, a clean, clear voice singing.

Her hands were gliding across my shoulders, lighting up the tender nerve endings in the skin of my neck, grasping my cheeks. She pulled me in for a kiss. That was when I saw her ears. The ends were pointed. I stopped myself, but her fingernails dug in behind my cheekbones. Her tongue flitted across my lips... a long, forked tongue, like a snake.

I don't remember how I got out, only that I nearly stumbled in front of a car. The music slowly faded from inside my head over the next few hours.

Tomorrow, I'm going back to Pittsburgh. This time I'm bringing a camera.

 




 :D And a happy NewBirYearDay to you as well! 




 No, I mean, it's not my birthday :P

 Or just start from new and read every story chronologically. 




 If you're not already, go check out the [nosleep index](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleepindex/wiki/index). Most of the series that have ever gotten more than 100 votes are linked there, and the staff lists whether they're complete or not. They also make recommendations on some of the best to start reading. 

Also, if you're looking to get started writing, but want some help and feedback before jumping into nosleep, check out /r/nosleepworkshops. Just remember, too, that the average writer for nosleep isn't a writer at all, they're just people with stories to tell. So if you've got one, lay it on us, and maybe I'll let you read my finale. 




 Well, not today. 




 I almost forgot about the feedback system! I really like it, actually. It's very positive, while still giving some areas to work on.

 It's almost like a normal company with real customer service? That's absurd.

 You spelled my name wrong. But yeah, listen to your lady, AMC. 




 /r/NosleepOOC has gone down the shitter. It's just full of people telling us to write and that it's okay for normal people to write stories and give them away for free. 




 So if we just look upstream, we'll find the land of the giants? 




 I really liked it. I think the format works. It gives a limited view into a hidden sotuation, and actually enhances it. The victim doesn't have any dialogue,  which is a little odd, since I'd have liked to know their motivations as well. Overall, yeah, well done. 




 Last action and suicide note is fine, because they'd have been alive to write it. The only ones that are unrealistic are those in which the narrator dies, and then somehow miraculously the story is posted to nosleep. That kind of story isn't realistic. 




 This isnt a happening-right-now-oh-God-what-should-I-do-help-me-nosleep kind of story. Im 24, and this happened when I got my first apartment at 19 years old.

After spending a year in the college dorms, I thought that living on my own would be a relaxing change. Instead of constant fights between roommates and parties dragging on into the wee hours of the night, Id be left alone in the quiet. My only company would be the old man who owned the downstairs of the house. The whole upstairs belonged to me, an attic converted into a studio apartment.

And things were quiet for a while. The whole first term of school went by unremarkably and some of the damage Id done to my brain cells and my GPA was undone.

For Christmas vacation, I decided to stay in town. Most people left for the Holidays, and being a college down, things pretty well emptied out. Suffice to say, I didnt exactly have a happy home to go back to, nor did I want to take the time off of my part time job.

Instead, I smoked a joint, put a frozen pizza in the oven and put on Netflix.

Alright, it was porn, you got me. When I finished, I closed the browser, but realized that the sound was still on. Even after I restarted my laptop, the sound of a woman moaning continued. Someone was crying, and it was coming from downstairs.

I was curious, and decided to take a look. My web cam had a long cord, and I lowered it out the window. There were other sounds now too, grunting and pounding.

As you can imagine, the idea didnt work very well. I could barely see a dark and out-of-focus shape through the window. A person was standing in the middle of the living room, bending over and standing up again in rhythm with the noses coming up through the floor. They looked like they were dancing or working out, but the noises didnt fit. It was definitely a person crying.

I watched for almost a full minute just to try to understand what was happening. Then the person yelled Help! On the screen, I saw the movements stop, and then she pitched against the ceiling right beneath my bed. The sound scared me so badly that the camera spun on its cable and I lost the view through the window. Id seen enough anyway.

I stood at the door to the stairs. Was it safe to go down? Was I safe if I stayed here? What if whatever was happening downstairs decided to come through the floor and into my apartment? Should I call the police? What would I even tell them? Should I put pants on before I go outside?

The noises had gone away. The ovens timer went off. After taking the pizza out, I sat on my bed and thought about what I should do. My high was still there, and it mixed with the comedown from the adrenaline, and soon I was peacefully asleep. 




 Hey thanks for inviting me to dinner at your house. I don't like how you've painted the walls in the kitchen. You can leave now. Bye bye.

 Ok. /u/HR just got an earful from me. 




 Totally welcome! Don't stop writing! 




 The title isn't very inviting. It does kind of go along with where the story starts but not where it ends up.

The first paragraph overdoes the narration. Between dialogue looks and facial expression is expressed and analyzed. Keep in mind that the audience is (something like) a group of people around the campfire. The first part of the paragraph doesn't quite flow as well as it would if it were naturally being told.

You couldn't even call what we did breaking in / This made it easy for Connor... to punch the pane into oblivion.

Does that not sound exactly like breaking in?

There are a bunch of places where the language is too big for the story. 

...that human instincts capitulated hesitation. The id seized control of the brain by harshly irregular means...

People just don't talk like that. It's one thing to use uncommon language to say something very specific, but in this case the sentence should be really simple and the language complicates it.

Some of the words aren't really used correctly, either.

uprooting a **hellfire** of dirt and rocks.

But a hellfire is... actually a fire. It just lends to the overall impression that the writer isn't totally interested in the story, but is more focused on writing the words. It's strange, and I find it to be pretty off-putting.

This part:

Hair, hanging downwards. The hopeless battle between wrist and tether. Blood, starkly red and seemingly omnipresent on the slick dirt floor. Groans, sick, thirsty cries hailing from an owner long devoid of hope that they'd ever reach kind ears.

was pretty creepy and well done. To me, that should be the real focus of the piece. The "villain" is then there to serve the fact that the characters weren't supposed to find that.

Overall, the story is there, but the strange wording gets confusing and takes more effort than it's worth to get through. A few run-throughs of editing to cut away the unnecessary stuff are needed. 




 Happy holidays!

 Wow that's really good. It always amazes me how few people get this. 




 I can't have children. My husband and I had just come to accept that. We didn't have money for a surrogate or an adoption, and by the time we crawled out from under our loads of debt we'd be too old. It would be irresponsible to try.

Last year on December 15, I got a letter in the mail. I almost threw it away along with the rest of the junk, but something about it... I think it might have actually been the paper. I'm no Patrick Bateman, but the creamy smoothness of the envelope was somehow just *right* in my hand the way that I'd never considered before. It was pleasing. The triple-folded sheet inside was the same way. I laid it out on the counter, smoothing it out by running my hand over its intoxicating surface and studied the words, the stork logo and even the signature on the bottom.

*"A gift,"* I read; the gift of creating a new life, which they would deliver for thousands who thought that conception was impossible.

I did the worst thing I could have done when confronted with that kind of gorgeous promise. I accepted. I called and set an appointment to be seen the next day, then I tucked the letter back into its envelope and stuffed it into the drawer next to our checkbook.

The next morning, my husband left for work and I thought about telling him as I kissed him goodbye. I didn't, though. Some part -- the rational part of me -- was sure that it was too good to be true. Just another ad for just-another clinic that wouldn't accept our just-another-insurance-plan.

The other part drew me on with reckless hope and curiosity. As I got dressed I thought about medical advancements I'd seen in the news that might make this possible. While eating breakfast I wondered what being pregnant would feel like. As I backed out the driveway I pictured what I was going to name her.

By the time I reached the building, my heart was racing with excitement. I hadn't let myself feel anything about children since we found out that I couldn't have them. Maybe I really hadn't realized how much I felt that I needed to become a mother. All of that was bubbling to the surface as I pulled into the parking lot.

The building was beautiful, if out of place. It certainly didn't fit the image that I'd made in my mind. The large center crouched near the top of the hill and looked out over the ocean. Natural light streamed in through dozens of bay windows that faced the water. The sheer white walls and floor seemed to glow from within.

The receptionist welcomed me and as she was checking me in, having me sign papers and fill out forms, I remarked on how beautiful the place was. It struck me that their usual customers must be paying fortunes to come here. She smiled and said that they're told that all the time, but that it was really more than just a doctor's office. The center focused on the "big picture" for both the mother and the child, and that fertilization was only the beginning. Most of the rooms, she said, were for recovery and bonding after the children were delivered.

"It's important to Dr. Bristol that the women we serve have a calming place during the transition of new life."

A nurse in white scrubs like I imagine Dolce and Gabbana might have designed came and led me into the back rooms. She took my vitals in one of the rooms. The natural light and warm feeling continued even deeper inside the building, away from the windows.

"I'll let the doctor know you're ready," she said, her soft, warm hand resting on the door knob. "... And congratulations. This is such a great opportunity for you." She smiled and left.

I wasn't waiting for long before the doctor politely knocked and peeked in through the door. Once again, I was surprised, but this time I was underwhelmed. The doctor was short and frumpily dressed. Here was the I'm-in-a-hospital feeling that had been missing since I'd walked in.

He didn't say hello or even look at me until he'd thoroughly studied my file in the computer through coke bottle glasses. His red, glistening face glowed against the backdrop of the white room.

"Ah," he said finally. "This is fantastic. I have just fantastic news for you. You're going to be able to have children. As a matter of fact, you're just perfect. Just fantastic." He smiled and rubbed his hands. "So, a boy or a girl?"

"Well, I... My husband and I haven't really talked about this, but I'd like a girl, I think."

"Perfect, though we could do a boy too, if you'd prefer that."

"Prefer it? You get to choose?"

"Well, *I* don't, but we allow all our new mothers to choose. It's our whole philosophy here."

The nurse in white knocked and re-entered the room, carrying a tray which she set on the table.

"What is?"

"To eliminate stress from the whole process. Some women we serve have a great deal of stress over those things. Many can't decide, so we end up delivering them twins. So many twins, actually, it's quite fantastic.

"So. Are we ready?"

"Ready?"

"Oh yes, we need to act fast if we're going to be able to get you in."

"I'm sorry, I was under the impression that this was just a screening. The letter said..."

"No no no! Don't stress. This isn't going to cost anything, and the decision is not permanent. If you change your mind at any time, you're more than welcome to come back and we'll help you through it. Does that help? I had hoped that we would be able to serve you today. A girl, you said."

"So, what, it's just a... some kind of treatment that will make me fertile again?"

"Yes, exactly."

"And... it's not going to cost anything?"

"It's my own very personal interest. Each year during the holidays I offer my service free of charge. A gift."

"And say if tomorrow, I talk to my husband and we decide again that we shouldn't have kids... I can just come back?"

"We'll take care of you. Whatever you need."

The whole thing was crazy, but what was there to lose? To gain?

"My husband, though, I mean, what do I say?"

"Say whatever you like... Or say nothing at all. This is your process, it works however you want it to. Exactly the way you want it."

"Sorry, I just... I'm surprised, that's all."

The nurse was offering me a tissue. Tears were streaming down my face, but I couldn't process what they meant. It was all overwhelming at that moment.

"Shall we, then?"

I nodded. The nurse prepared the needle, and Dr. Bristol swabbed the area on my behind with disinfectant. A pinch was all that I felt. I tried not to shake as I held in my sobs of joy.

"All done."

That night I made love to my husband like I hadn't since we were in college. I didn't say a word to him about the clinic or the doctor or the treatment. The moment never seemed right. The last time we'd talked about children was three years ago; did I really even know how he felt about it anymore? Then after the deed, I felt as if I'd lied to him, ambushed him. It would be a surprise, but an innocent one, at least as far as he knew.

The next morning I was sore. My legs were wobbly and my stomach was churning and bloated. From the lack of sleep, my head was foggy. On my way to the shower, I threw up. I felt drunk.

The day after, I felt even worse, and I was hungry *all. the. time.*

The third day is when I noticed that my stomach was sticking out, even more than it had on Thanksgiving. It wasn't just food, but wasn't it early to be getting a bump?

On the fourth day, I called the clinic again. I made it clear that I had to be seen immediately. Something was wrong.

"Don't stress," the receptionist told me. "Just stay calm and come out whenever you can."

---

"It's too late," he told me. "Up to the third day, it's possible to remove the fetuses, but at four, it's hardly doable."

"Fetuses? What are you talking about? They're... they're nothing! I *just* had sex. It isn't enough time to..."

"This is fantastic, really. You're going to make them all so happy."

"Them, who?"

"The new mothers, of course."

"What?"

"Well, they're all waiting."

"What are you talking about? They're *waiting?* Waiting for what?"

"For their children, of course. Your children."

"What? I didn't agree to this."

"On the contrary. I'm quite sure that you signed the release."

"But I -- You said that I could change my mind. I want to change my mind, I'm changing it. This isn't what I thought."

"I'm sorry. It is too late. You should just be happy! Hundreds of women are going to get to know the joys of motherhood because of you."

*"Hundreds?"*

"Oh yes. You see, our method is to fertilize *all* of the eggs at once. One shot. Of course, there are *thousands* of those. After fertilization, we harvest the most desirable according to the wishes of the mother. Through a simple surgery, we transplant them from your uterus into the new mother's. You're a hero, really, you've given them a great gift."

"I don't want to. I just... I can't have children. I can't."

"You can't?"

"I'm infertile. That's what they said -- infertile!"

"I hadn't heard about that, of course. Hm... This does change the dynamics of things. I'm afraid that you may still not be able to have a child of your own."

"So you'll... stop this. This... *thing* inside?"

"It's too late, miss. Those other mothers... promises have been made to them. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't be ethical. We need to see you in two days. Please make sure to schedule an appointment on your way out."

 Let that be a warning: Remember to set out some milk and cookies! 




 Woman gets abducted under the guise of being hired by a Wall Street firm. They keep her locked in a room made to hold women like her so they can use her for sex. When she's no longer desirable, they dispose of her.

The last line tries to touch on the expectations that got her there. It's intentionally a little vague, but her parents basically said that they wouldn't hurt her.  There's a confused sense of "love" or "want" and a misunderstanding of the sinister reasons that the business hired her in the first place. Parents' best intentions vs. real worldly evil. 




 They said they hired me for my resume, but I never worked one day in that job. They called me into the top floor office and passed me around, then they shared me with their friends. 

When I said I wanted to leave, they shut me in a room -- furnished and locked, like it was made for this depraved purpose. 

When I said I'd sue, they laughed. When I fought back, their smiles grew wider. When I was spent, they brought me here and left me to die.

Back when I told my parents about my new job on Wall Street, they told me, "They're gonna love you."

 I feel like there's more here than what's being told. It's a decent beginning though.

The format is more than a little strange. Is this an official document like a patient chart? Maybe you could do a little research as to what that might actually looks like. Else, E-mail traffic might work, too. I just don't get much sense of what I'm looking at.

The doctors don't seem very confident. Not able to diagnose an infection? Not willing to prescribe specific meds? Not sure that's realistic.

 First off, this part:

 I went to check on her when I noticed something wrong. Her vomit was moving. Crawling. As Mary continued to heave up piles of small squiggly crawling creatures blood began to splatter. First small drops in the sick. Then eventually the blood began to flow heavier. Mary no longer heaved but weakly hacked as the size of the insects crawling out of her mouth grew larger. Coated in blood and sick they came scampering over her now pale and sweaty skin unaware of the destruction they just caused.

is AWESOME. That's where the horror is.

Now, to get to there, you took a strange sort of roundabout way. You start with "My sister Mary loves to travel," implying that she's still alive, and that this is something that she does all the time.

Then the main character is going on a trip with her, and it becomes clear that the story is focusing on this single instance.

After that, it jumps into the future. "Years later, I recently looked into one of those boxes and found Mary's travel journal." I think the story would work better with this part taken out. In the climax you already get to see that the vomit is moving, so it only really lessens the surprise.

Mary dies, in the main character's arms and only *then* does the main character call the hospital.

Then, it just sort of ends. That last line is pretty weak.

Basically, it just needs more **structure**. Some kind of cohesive plan to keep it all together and in order. Even if the events actually happened the way they're said in this, for the purposes of storytelling, just make them streamlined.

* Mary and I went for a trip to Ecuador
* Mary ate strange food and got sick
* She died when bugs crawled out of her stomach
* I never found out what killed her

rather than

* Mary travels a lot
* I went on a trip with her
* Mary ate strange food and got sick
* At the end of the trip, I shoved her things into the closet
* Years later, I pulled the things out of the closet
* Mary had written that she was sick
* Mary was sick, I was there, here's how I know she was sick

Good luck!

There's this place I know. It's somewhere down the rabbit hole.  
It's filled with oddities and terror. The knives cut with precision, leave no room for error.  
The people look back with blackened sockets. They bar the door behind them, and then they lock it.  
It's cold and wet, the air is sour. Some might call it hell on earth, but we just call it ours.  
This place is a secret, but you're invited. So won't you join us in this place where earths wrongs are righted? 




 It's on the edge for me. The ambiguity between human and deer (?) definitely makes it creepy. If the end didn't say conclusively one way or the other, I think it might do better. Basically, let the reader decide whether the thing has hooves or not.

I got a nice Jason feel at some parts, though, which was a lot of fun. Good luck! 




 Boots on the sand. Doomed.
