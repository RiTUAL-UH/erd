 She hasn't been exsanguinated nor given Digitalis. Hopefully she'll be alright and this has nothing to do with the Eve's. 




 I'd certainly read more!  




 That's awful. I'm so sorry you had to go through that. Thanks for sharing with us, OP, and I hope things have changed for the better for you. 




 Tell your brother the truth. Tell him about the picture, the woman in the kitchen, remind him of the heavy breathing. All of it. It isn't fair for him to think he's crazy when you know the truth. 




 Thanks for clarifying that.

Can I ask though, now that it's done, have you got any clarity as to why you did it? 
 




 Is the mark in the same place your wife's cancer started? Did she lose her hair during treatment? 




 You ok OP?

 My mom does that too. 

She'd dump out my cup of freshly made tea and put the cup in the sink, then complain about how many dishes I've left, or take all my shower stuff out of the basket I have in there, and replace it with hers, then act oblivious when I ask where my stuff is. The best though is when she takes a bag of my laundry to wash with hers when I'm busy, and then SWEARS she can't find any of the items that were in that bag. Which I then find in her room. My whole life has been spent looking for my stuff she refuses to admit she moved/lost. 




 Was she.... your sister? What?  




 Nosleep = crack. Even when I want to stop, I can't. 




 I'm sad this was removed!

But on a better note, I won this game this morning! Had a hair elastic in my hand while sitting in bed, don't remember setting it down, found it underneath my pillow! 

Edit: Did you change the clock on my stove? I reset it after a power outage and the next day it was 11 minutes off.
Second edit: 3:49 am. Have lost my cellphone 3 times now, twice found in bed, once in bathroom. Bunch of Chrome tabs I don't remember opening. I promise to never notice you again. 




 North Wales Hospital right? I've read about it. Are you alright?
Did you get into the burned out bits or just the stuff where they were trying to convert it to apartments? (Stupid plan, eh?)  




 Upvoted cause my black lab named Abigail and I are seriously curious about this. 




 I... don't think so. I feel like an idiot having done this but all the randomly capitalized words ends up being: ssmrtwdmhwhhttiiattttoatfohotujoto. Which I think is nonsense. 




 What? 




 This is seriously my favorite thing on the internet. 




 Just a suggestion, please format the conversations a bit better. I want to read it but I can't follow the huge block of text. :) 




 I think something is up but I can't place exactly what it is, it's just a feeling plus Steph being M.I.A. The dog I have no explanation for. It's only when we put Jake in his room though. Not any other time.  




 No worries friend. I've got a grown man snoring on one side of me, Jake is asleep on the other side with every blanket on the bed on top of him, and the dog is on my feet. I've had to read my replies 3 or 4 times to check for typos, EVERY time. I think we may go stay at my dad's for a bit. He lives out of the city in a pretty quiet spot (thankfully with wifi.) I've got a few days off coming soon and Win has some vacation time still.  




 Hey folks. I wasn't sure where to post this but figured here was a good start. 

Suffice it to say, my son is 7 going on 8 and he has been through a traumatic event. Could this be causing him to regress in certain aspects but not others?

We practiced extended breastfeeding and he weaned at around 3.5, with the odd nightmare or stomach bug bringing him back to wanting to nurse up until about 5. He's an articulate kid so he understands why I'm  not allowing it now and he can communicate his desire although not necessarily his reasons. 

I'm just wondering if any other EBF mom out there has dealt with something similar, and what you'd suggest I do in this situation. 
Thanks in advance. 




 Ah okay I get where you were going with that. But no, poor guy just seems to have shit luck. I had one miscarriage before Jake, his next girlfriend had one and left him shortly after, and Steph's had two previous to this pregnancy.  




 Something IS off. 
I wish I could put my finger on it so I could describe how it feels here or all of /nosleep could just be here for a day to feel it. 

Like Win even brings Jake to see me when I'm working because it's this tight chest can't focus kind of desperation and general wrongness. Left over anxiety maybe? 


As for Win being involved... He has the kindest and gentlest soul I've ever met. He loves Jake and I so much and he is such a genuinely good man. I trust him as much as I trust myself. I can say with certainty that he isn't involved. His only flaw here may have been withdrawing from Steph the way he did, to be with Jake and I. 




 Not much but a small update added. 




 Tiny update added. 




 Op deleted their account, what do we do now? 




 Update us again soon Op! Stay safe. 




 If I went into my mom's room upset about knocking in the middle of the night, she'd tell me it was gas and yell at me for waking her up. Stuff like this is like 90% of the reason I got a dog.  




 Your writing is beautiful OP. I'll be checking for updates! 




 Oh. My. God. I was picturing Animal from the Muppets the whole time I was reading. Lol. 




 I was picturing Animal from The Muppets. 




 I haven't got much reason to suspect her but I feel the same way. What if A: She was involved or B: Something happened to her. But at the same time, she told Win she was pregnant and then he moved in with me cause our kid was missing. I would be peeved too. Either way though Win is trying to get in touch with her family to see if they know where she is. I'll update this post when/if I know more.

 Hey nosleepers! Sorry this has taken so long. A lot of things have happened.

Jake, Win, and myself, are home and healthy and safe. We had a few cops hanging around for a while but it's all finished now.


The security guard from the hospital? He took Jake. He left the box of things for us to find. He came into our home while we were gone and took those things back after a set amount of time. I only got to keep the key card because I had Jake's keys with me when he came here. He did the same to the families of every woman we found in that room, only they came alone. I would have ended up as his next victim had I not brought Win with me.

He would take the child, keeping them alive and well, dragging them around with him as he planted clues, and then he would sedate them when the mother got close enough to find them in the room. If the mother came alone, he would sedate her, kill the child, and move on to the next victim. He was looking for someone to win his game. I guess he was looking for me.

According to the police, his home was full of pictures of me. Some taken from my Facebook page, some he took himself from short distances while I was out or working, dating back to the time I was volunteering at the hospital. It seems I was his end target. He had deemed me smart enough to win.

The hospital has been shut down now, the guard is being held in a secure wing at the forensic hospital, and my life is going back to normal.  No one has heard from Steph, her things are gone from the apartment she shared with Win, her phone is disconnected, and were moving on. Win, Jake, and I, are going to be a family like we should have been. None of us can stand being apart. As Im typing this, Win is sitting on one side of me, Jake is asleep with his head on my shoulder, and the dog is asleep on him.

Everything is going to be okay. I just wish we could find Steph.


Update: (I know I said this was final.)
___________________________________________________________________________________________

I just wanted to let everyone know Jake is doing great being home with us. He doesn't even really seem freaked out about what happened. He says he knew we'd find him, just like I knew he was okay. I swear this kid and I have some sort of telepathic link. #momproblems. Win hardly leaves our side. We've decided to keep Jake out of school for a bit until things calm down so I'm down to part time hours at work and I'm homeschooling him. All three of us sleep in my bed every night with the dog. We tried putting Jake in his own room last night but no one could sleep and the dog wouldn't stop freaking out so we brought him back in with us and everything was fine

On the Steph front, there hasn't really been much. Win has been in touch with her parents but they haven't heard from her since Jake went missing. Her phone rings straight to voicemail. I thought I saw her walking by across the street from my work the other day. I was out smoking on the front stoop at sunset, which is of course the least conducive time visibility wise, but I would have sworn it was her. I yelled her name a few times but she didn't look up. I guess it wasn't her.

Win has thrown himself into being Jake's dad and being here for me. I know he's still shaken from Jake being missing and I know he's terrified something's happened to Steph and the baby. A lot of the pregnancies Win creates seem to end in miscarriage. There are just a lot more questions than answers right now.

I'll keep updating this post until I run out of space.

 




 I'm Canadian! Born and raised. 




 No idea! The redditors don't like me. :(
I added the second update to the third one and the final one will be up in a few days!

 Sorry for losing you with this one. The update has been located and added to this one to make reading it easier. The post keeps getting taken down. 




 I had a hard time getting that one to stay up so I added it to this one. 




 Stay safe OP. Bottled water for a while and be mindful of what you eat. Keep us updated! 




 First Update: 

After spending nearly half the day yesterday between the ear drum shattering roar of Wins straight-piped Integra, and telling people over and over about my missing child and begging them to put up his missing posters, Im exhausted but somehow still too wired for sleep. We didn't find anything new. The map is missing. I swear I had it in my wallet and now it's gone. I'm sure I set it down somewhere and forgot it.
As with most missing posters, a phone number, mine to be specific, is on the bottom of the poster we've been putting up, asking people to call us if they have any information. I've had a few prank calls, a few well-wishers, and way too many false sightings. But tonight I had a different kind of call. Tonight a man who said he was a security guard at the mental hospital left me a message telling me he could help me. My phone didn't ring, but somehow between checking it at Tim Hortons and checking it again about 15 minutes later at home, Id had a call.
Now, this hospital is nearly abandoned. I mean there might be 50 patients left, all long term residents with nowhere else to go, no doctors on staff, nurses and CCAs take care of the daily work and a Doc visits once a week. I used to volunteer there a few years ago, reading books to patients. I dont remember this particular security guard but I was only there for a few hours a week so thats not all that strange is it? Anyway his message said to give him a call at 5am when hes on break so thats what Im going to do.
On the way home earlier I had thought the radio was talking about missing kids in town but after frantically fumbling at the volume knob and nearly knocking the car into neutral, it turns out theres a fourth woman gone missing. The newest one, Catie Millier, is an old school friend and her son is about Jakes age. Sad. I hope they find her. The last one turned up dead in New Brunswick.
I got up at 4:45 so I could be awake to call the guard at 5. I was sitting downstairs at the kitchen table drinking tea and smoking when Win, looking rather disheveled, stumbled in and sat across from me. I dialed the guards number and put the phone on speaker so we could both hear. His name is Tim, and from what I gather he remembers me from the days I volunteered there. He asked if we had found anything Jake might have left behnd, like clues or anything, which I thought was a bit odd. We told him that yes, we had found a few things but were having a hard time making sense of them. It wasn't until he asked what Jake had left behind that I really got concerned. I guess you could say my "spidey senses" were tingling. I really just wanted to end the conversation there because I wasn't sure how this man though he could help us, of ir he had just wanted to snoop, or if he knew something he wasn't saying. Win got mad though and started cursing at this guy. I shushed him and leaned closer to the phone. Tim had gone silent and in the background over the hiss of the line, I could hear a loud speaker. Code White. All staff report to central desk. Patient Miller armed and considered dangerous. The line abruptly went dead and we were left stunned in the deafening silence of the kitchen. Patient Miller. Its an awfully big coincidence that she just went missing and I heard her last name during that phone call. I wonder
Win has decided were going there tomorrow (today now I guess. We haven't slept.) Sunday is the day all the family members visit so we're hoping to blend into the small crowd. Hopefully security lets us in with no trouble but if not, I still have my pass card and hopefully my alarm code is still the same. We need to find out whats happening there.
I still haven't figured out how to add pictures but since the map is missing anyway I guess it doesn't matter. I've asked around a bit and the key is almost certainly for a pad lock. No one knows what the pass card is for but it seems like a logo has been filed off somehow. Almost in the size and shape of the logo on my pass card for the hospital.
My dog has been barking out my bedroom window for about an hour now. She stops for a few minutes at a time but keeps growling. We've gone outside and looked around but don't see anything. The house is locked up tight and we're all safe and sound in here.
I'll update more as soon as I can. We're going to check out the hospital after work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Second Update:


We got into the hospital. 


My pass card still worked and my alarm code was the same. We got in no problem. We searched around for a while and couldn't find any staff and all of the patients were locked in their rooms for the night. I wanted to explore but needed someone to watch my back so Win set up shop in the empty security booth to keep watch over the cameras. Before I set out I grabbed a flashlight from the desk and called him on my cellphone so we could keep in constant contact. 


The hospital itself seemed exactly the way I left it, except deserted. Only one of four wards was currently in use and housed all of the current residents. Charts were stacked neatly, chairs were pushed in, it seemed like everyone had just left for the night. None of the patient rooms had names on them, just numbers, so there were no answers about Catie Miller from that. I figured Id keep looking and come back to check out the charts later. I checked every room, jiggling the door handle and shining the flashlight in the small windows to see which rooms had patients. This whole time I had Win in my ear asking questions and letting me know I was alone. The hallway I was in seemed to go on forever. The way the hospital is set up is the main hub, with a corridor running off of each of the four sides. Three of them were shut with large steel doors, chained and padlocked. 


I kept walking down the hallway I was in, expecting to hit a dead end, but instead I ran into a pair of steel doors just like the ones closing off the other wards. Only these ones were propped open with door stops. Behind them lay a few more feet of corridor, and what looked like a pair of elevator doors. I looked for buttons but couldn't find any, so I pulled the flat head screwdriver out of the bag slung across my shoulder and pried the damn doors open. 


The walls in this corridor were disgusting. They were brown and damp looking with veins of black running from floor to ceiling. The lights were dim and flickering and the smell was unbelievable. Win let me know I had gone past the last camera and I was walking blind. I told him to head my way since the ward was empty and it seemed safer now for us to be together. I walked back out of this weird hallway and waited by the elevator type doors until he arrived. I hadn't realized how anxious I was until he came into view but I practically flying-squirreled him out of excitement to see him. 


Together we walked back into the hallway and started looking around. There were bits of paper on the floor here and there and we could hear a steady hum, barely audible over our own breathing. Following the hum led us around a corner to a set of sliding doors like youd imagine for a quarantine section. My pass card wouldn't work but the card from Jake's keys opened them. We weren't prepared for what we found behind them. It looked like the morgue. A row of steel tables ran the length of the room and our breath could be seen in the air. 


On the tables lay a row of women, seemingly naked, and covered from chest to knees by a neatly folded sheet. The closest to the door was a very familiar face. It was Catie. I walked cautiously over to her and checked her pulse, which thankfully she still had. That was when I noticed each woman was connected to an IV. Whoever put them here was keeping them sedated and alive. For what?


We checked each womans pulse, and each was colder than the last, her heart beating a little bit slower, but every last one was still alive. Win went over to check the rows of doors for body storage and in each of the 9 drawers there was a child, male and female, around the same age, none of them with a pulse. One child for each woman in the room. Turning away from the gruesome sight I realized there was one table left, the figure on it covered entirely by a sheet. The IV was still running so we pulled down the sheet and I hit the floor. My son, my Jake, laying on that metal table in that room with all those women. And that was when I realized it. 

All of the women on that table looked like me. Dark hair, dark eyes, short, thick around the middle. We had similar features, seemed to be around the same age.


Jake was alive. He still had a pulse. Win dialed 911 while I held Jakes hand and sobbed into his sweater. All of the children in the drawers were naked but he was still fully clothed, wearing that sweater. It was mine when I got pregnant and he had claimed it a few years ago. It was still huge on him but the kid loved it because it had my name on the sleeve.

 
Win says it was only about 15 minutes but it seemed like a week before the police and paramedics showed up. Teams and teams of them. The coroner arrived shortly after but we didnt get to speak with him as Jake had been given something to wake him up and he was starting to come around. We left in the ambulance with him and were currently at the hospital. Jake is frail and thin and the poor kid is so pale but hes happy to see us and hes eating jello and we have officers outside the room keeping us safe.  Win just came back in from giving his statement and now its my turn. Ill update as soon as I can.
 




 I agree with the salt. Do the doorways and windows, and maybe a circle around your bed. 

Have you thought of doing what it says? Just... going up north? I'm sure us nosleep-ers would have your back! 




 Could you take a sample of the water to have it tested independently? Do you have a meal hall on campus, could it be food poisoning? Does your roommate have any chronic health issues? It could be a virus attacking those who are susceptible?
Edit: Could it be lead poisoning? The article says the building was built is the 20's. 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2gcei5/jake_update/
Just a little update and some strange goings-on. I'll add more as soon as there is more. Thanks for your well wishes. 




 I'll add photos as soon as I figure out how. I feel like we're missing something obvious. I think the key is for a padlock but there isn't a lock in the entire house. I'm back to work this weekend but will update as often as possible. 




 No one at the school seems to remember him leaving. Everyone's response is the same. "His dad picked him up for a doctor's appointment. Expect him home later this evening." It's almost like it's scripted, like they have no other information on it. The police have no where to turn. There are no leads, no evidence, Jake's just... gone. Disappeared. I haven't figured out the stuff in the box yet but we're trying. He's such a smart kid, I know he left us something, I feel like I'm missing it. I'll update as soon as I know more. 




 Original was taken down as an intro. Adding the update here. Hopefully it stays up.

I suppose I should start this off by giving you a little bit of background so that things Ill mention further into my story will make sense. Here goes.

My name is Sarah, Im 23, and my 7 year old sons name is Jake, Yes that means I had him at 16. I was raised by a mechanic and a seamstress so resourceful and scrappy are second nature along with being just a little bit wild, hence being a teen mom.

I had never really put much thought into sharing my story but recently my cousin Diane mentioned r/nosleep  and after lurking here for a while I thought you all might be able to offer some advice or at least some support. Let me cut to the chase. My son has been missing for about 2 months. 2 weeks ago, they called off the search.

I work as a nanny and when Im at work, Jake hangs out with my mom. We all live together in a townhouse with a handful of cats and a dog who thinks shes a cat. We have a good and calm life and aside from scaring the shit out of myself on a regular basis with gore and horror, nothing eventful happens. I work, Mom works, Jake goes to school. Hes one of the smartest kids I've ever met. He loves to read and draw and he can make music with just about anything. His bedroom is right next to mine.

I hadn't seen Mom or Jake for about 2 days, which sounds terrible but because I work night shifts, Mom works days, and Jake is in school, we can pass like three ships in the night for a few days at a time. I got in around 8:30am, crawled into bed with my dog, and passed out like it was a normal day, but let me tell you, it wasn't. I woke up startled and uncomfortably sweaty around 4:30pm to my dog barking frantically at my bedroom door, hopping up and down trying to get out to see my Mom who was in the bathroom across the hall. I let her out and followed her, rubbing sleep from my eyes, and adjusting my shirt so that nothing was hanging out. (Im a rough sleeper.) Mom opened the bathroom door to greet us and I could tell something wasn't right. She explained to me that when she had gone to pick Jake up from school, she was informed that his father had picked him up for a doctors appointment at around noon and that we should expect him to be dropped off to us later in the evening.  That wasn't all that strange, Win picks Jake up all the time, but usually he tells us first, and Jake didn't have a doctors appointment. Mom had tried calling Win from the car but had no luck so after I tried a few times, I gave his fiance Steph a call.

Steph: Hey Sarah, how are things? Hows Jake?
Me:  Hey Steph, thats why Im calling. Jakes school told us that Win picked him up this afternoon. Its totally cool if he did, god knows the kid could use an afternoon off, its just that he didn't tell me so Im worried.
Steph: Sarah I dont really want to be the one to say this, but Win and I have been home together all day. I was sick this morning and he called off work so we could just hang out. Im going to explain to him whats going on and well be right over okay?
Me: Okay Steph. Dont let him drive. The last thing we need is you guys getting hurt.

By this time I had started to panic a little. Mom was watching me, still standing in the bathroom doorway, and I slid down the hallway wall into a seated position. I waved my hands at her and stared blankly and thankfully the poor woman understood I needed a cigarette.  She sat down across from we and we just sat there staring blankly til the dog ran down the stairs to greet Steph and Win.
They yelled Hey! while trudging up the stairs, the dog trying her best to herd them. Shes a half-assed Border Collie. Steph sat down with us and Win stepped over mom and I in the hallway and opened Jakes bedroom door. It looked exactly as it had 2 days before when I tucked him in. The bed was rumpled, books under and on top of the covers, a precarious pile of even more books with a water glass on top stacked beside the bed. His window was open a crack, which seemed strange, but I couldn't really place why. I got up and followed Win in, putting my arm around his back and feeling comforted when he wrapped his arm around my shoulders in response. Together we rifled through all of Jakes books, flipped pages and lifting dust jackets, finding nothing. A final scan of the room showed one lone book sitting atop his dresser, nearly falling of the edge. It wasn't really a book but one of those magnetic boxes that look just like a book. Inside was a set of keys, what looked like a map obviously drawn by Jake, and a framed photo of Win, Jake, and I. 

We called the police. I had a feeling we were making a mistake, involving them wouldn't end well, but everyone else insisted so I gave in. Two officers came and checked out the house, gave Jakes room a once over, (at least my family let me hide the book-box just in case they wanted to take it,) and before they left I asked them to dust and fingerprint the window frame and sill. They treated me like I was crazy, because were on the second floor, but they did it because mom and I swore the window had been closed. The cops left to talk to a few people at Jakes school and file the report for us and that was the most action they ever took. A month and a half and no leads later, after questioning and accusing everyone I hold dear, including myself, multiple times, the search was called off and the case was deemed cold.

Win and Steph had been living with us by then, alternating sleeping on the couch and on an air mattress in my room with me. Steph's sick was actually morning sickness that was very nearly killing her, and the history between Win and I was beginning to cause some tension. The day the case was declared cold, Steph walked out on Win and seldom returns his calls. He started sleeping in my bed. Nothing happened. We didnt even cuddle. But being apart made us both anxious so we were sticking together. We still are. 

This is way too long and wordy for one post. I just wanted to give background. I'll add more tomorrow.
___________________________________________________________________________________________

[UPDATE]

Win and I havent left each others sides. We do everything together. Last night we drank some wine and had a look at Jakes map again. It seems like to starts at our house, and takes us to the mental hospital by the community college campus, in sort of a 7 year old round about fashion. I dont know if he was confused, trying to confuse us, or trying to confuse whoever was watching him draw it. I can only tell because he used the same symbols Ive been teaching him since he started school. # is always home. I used to draw it on city maps and in his school agendas so he would always know that if he was lost, that was home. The ferry terminal, ~ (waves,) the school, ^ (dunce caps, he doesnt get this one but it makes me laugh,) and the two hospitals nearly across from one another, + (EMERG) and +  (Mental Hospital.) The map seems like its meant to go on but he was stopped short of finishing it. The keys are his, but with two additions. The first is a tiny brass key like youd use for a padlock, the second is one of those little keychain cards, like a store loyalty program, only its completely white with only the scan strip on the back. Ill admit we were a few sheets to the wind when we discovered what the map meant. Perhaps thats why it came to me so easily, who knows. After a particularly energetic round of the bed-spins, I was trying to steady myself, sitting against the footboard toying with the framed photo of Jake, Win, and I, flipping it over and over in my hands to distract myself. As I turned it back and forth I began to notice that the frame and the back were not entirely attached anymore. As if someone had separated the front metal frame from the velvet covered cardboard backing. Win had been rolling back and forth across the bed for a while but when he saw me slip my thumbnail into the space between the frame and the back he sat bolt upright. He leaned over and peered into the space as I used my nails to pry the gap apart. I expected to find nothing and boy was I shocked when I noticed the piece of paper wedged in there. We pulled it out and unfolded it and in Jakes carefully practiced, uneven lettering, it said I am Taken. Mom Hide. We mulled that over for a while and came up with nothing, eventually passing out on top of the covers, fully clothed. So this morning Im sitting here writing this, nursing a horrendous wine hangover, and attempting to eat the greasy fried egg Win swears will fix it. Were going out today to put up some posters and talk to some people. SOMEONE must know where my child is and Im gonna find them. Ill update when we get home if theres any information. 
























 We're still here and the account is still active.
Probably not for long.
I wish he had listened. Next time one of these is posted I'll make sure to take screen caps. 




 See? Thank you. Tell this guy to listen!  




 Jesus Jumpin'. If your dumb ass gets killed because you didn't listen to the one person who knows what's coming, then I 110% support evolutionary theory 'cause that shit will be a prime example of survival of the fittest. 




 Shit. Okay. Eventually she's going to threaten you if you don't keep typing. She won't speak to you she'll just be reading over your shoulder. Warren called her Mel but I guess maybe he misheard her. Either way you need to get the hell out of there now. 




 Sure looks like it.  




 Yeah THAT'S what you should get from that... Warren was her date last night. She made him make the same post and the general consensus says she killed him, posted a few comments, and then deleted the account. 




 Okay dude seriously. Get out of where you are. Her name is Mel or something right? She's reading over your shoulder, right? Our questions, everything you type? Get a move on. Get out. Or you're going to end up like Warren. 




 I've only seen one more, but they're real! You didn't imagine them. 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2jhj7r/hi_my_name_is_warren_ask_me_anything/ Deleted now but it was an identical post. Last night. His name was Warren.  




 Ask her about Warren and get your affairs in order. Don't drink the beer. 




 No... she chose to be an ex when the new shiny girl-toy was more interesting than her fiancee (me) was...
Loon calls are also creepy as hell. I've heard some odd stuff I couldn't place especially when I lived in the woods. Owls sound like a woman being murdered.  




 Has there been any news? 




 I can't find it! I can't for the life of me remember what it was called. Something about someone working late and there being an odd customer or something and then she ends up in the walk in fridge/freezer and then the thing woman whatever took her cellphone and made another post I think. 




 Well it's raining and I have a cold of some sort but otherwise I'm great. And yourself? 




 wat? 




 Ugh. I smoke out my bedroom window at night so I don't have to go outside and now I'm too creeped out. 




 I assumed the handprints were relevant.  




 I second the fox theory. I seriously woke up in the middle of the night and made my ex go out with a flashlight because it sounded exactly like a screaming newborn and I couldn't rationalize the noise. I was also terrified (thanks nosleep.) It was a fox standing in the middle of the road in front of my house making the noise.  




 Hey people who know about doppelgangers! Is it odd for your doppelganger to do things you do, including dating your significant other's doppelganger? I dated a woman for a few years after my son's father and I broke up and we would hear at least twice a week that we had just been wherever we were, or someone had seen us around town while we were actually on vacation, etc. 




 She's probably gonna kill you. Like that one who ate the girl in the freezer and posted from her cellphone. Nosleep Butler, any help there? 




 Where would you suggest we don't dig at? 




 The flower smell makes me think possession. Any family curses or deals with demons we should know about? 




 Read the sidebar, punk. 




 Says one comment but see no comment? Confused.
Don't answer or answer with "City Morgue, you whack'em we pack'em" or something equally silly. Could also call your phone provider from a different line and see if there's something up on their end. 




 I totally agree with the things with emotional significance keeping you safe. When I was a kid a lot of strange stuff happened to/around me. My parents got me a dog after my grandfather asked who I was playing with, while I was playing alone in the yard. They won't admit that's why they got her, of course. But I had her for 18 years and when she passed away we had her cremated so she could continue to keep me safe. My room (where her ashes are) is still the safest one in the house. 




 The anniversary could easily be a stresser for him, causing him to act out of character especially since he wouldn't know exactly what to do with his feelings. Hopefully the doctor's visit shed some light on what's happening. Stay safe OP, and stay strong for your brother. Please keep us updated. 




 OP if your brother has a regular doctor, I'd contact them and have him seen asap. Something may have scared him and he can't deal with it properly or something. My only experience with autism is my 4 year old nephew so the traits may manifest differently with age, but I know when Evvy is confused or can't process something, he acts VERY strange and sometimes creepy. 




 Removed cause it's an intro now that I've come back to comment. Update us Op? 




 I need to know how this turned out! It just.. died off. 




 Hey OP! Update? 




 Me too! What was that about? 




 Am I the only one calling bullshit on the parents reason for moving? They're looking for/running from something. And the date nights are suspicious. And the protecting you and someone yelling "wrong one" right before your parents came in your room, OP. I'm betting your parents know who took your brother and why. 




 Read this as "Call the poop!" I shouldn't be on here when I'm that tired. 




 Parent to parent, I'm sorry you're dealing with this. I think you may be eating your daughter in the casserole. You should check out/have the cops check out your neighbors. 




 Dude. Don't hurt /nosleep. Those of us who hang out here take it seriously and we're not hurting anyone else on Reddit by lurking on our own sub. If you don't like it, don't read it. Simple as. 

As for your hacker, I'd suggest forgetting your quest to make a bunch of people who deal with demons and stalkers and ghosts, hate you, and you should be pretty safe. 




 Do the missing letters here and there mean anything?
Edit: Too much nosleep. Disregard the question. 




 Read the title, started singing Barrett's Privateers. "I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier, the last of Barrett's Privateers!!" 




 Thanks for clarifying! 




 I'd call you a cunt but you don't have the warmth or the depth. Bugger off and leave us with our psychopathy in peace. :) 




 Take it to your neighbor like he said and wash your hands of the situation! 




 Maybe yes but maybe no. Don't put too much pressure on her to tell you the truth right now, as that may push her further away, if you know what I mean. But also if you feel you need to know, and she's behaving differently, then I'd suggest continuing to ask her gently. 




 Yes please! Tell us all the things! 




 Or there was a bike gang of monsters who interrupted them? 




 I need to know more! What has happened since? 




 I'm excited for this to be continued! I have a bunch of those closets in my house. The only one that has a handle on the inside is the one in my bedroom. 




 So wait. We think Gabe did something awful to her? 




 But Johnny and shotguns! I second the southern accent. 




 Why removed?! 
























 You doin' ok OP? Any news for us? 




 How can we help? 




 You could just add it to this one to avoid the post ban. I had to do that a couple times when I posted about my son. 




 Maybe you're just an asshole? 




 I... I think you're dead. I don't know how you're posting on nosleep but the crying, the being ignored like you're not there, etc. Were you in any kind of accident or did anything strange happen? Any missing time?  




 Yeah... I know we're supposed to believe this stuff but... 




 Creepy but won't scar you for life. Promise. 




 It is SO not your fault. Accidents happen. You didn't do anything wrong. Also, I'm sorry you're having a hard time with your transition. It's this awful cycle where being in the wrong body makes you depressed and being depressed makes you unsuitable for T and surgery, which makes you more depressed, etc. I hope you hang in there OP. Feel free to PM me if you wanna talk. I have a little experience. Not in the dead guy department but in the trans department. 




 What did it say?! Why isn't she feeling well? 




 Don't jump OP. You're safe now. 




 I had this theory but I haven't been able to figure it out myself. Op's username spelled on the keyboard of a phone could spell KNOCK with an extra letter. Op sent me : 42764440. I don't know if I'm patient enough to figure out what all the numbers could mean but maybe if it's a group effort?
Edit - for this cipher to work, the 1's don't mean anything.  




 Is it possible you watched something that happened in the past play out again? What is the history of the building? 




 Kaskistentie, Finland? 




 I'm seriously gonna need to watch Preppers. Everyone keeps talking about it.  




 Your username. 




 Stop panicking. You're going to be okay you just have to stay calm and be logical. Make a list of things you need: food, water, etc. Then make a list of ways to get those things. You're alone there so what about taking what you need and keeping track of it so you can repay it? That would ease your conscience. Better yet if the store computer systems are working, scan your items, go through the process on screen, and print yourself a receipt. As for fuel for your car, there are tanks underground in the parking lot of most gas stations. They're covered by manhole covers which you can lift and drop a bucket into the tank to get fuel. It's easier than siphoning. 

Edit: PM me if you need someone to talk to/more advice. I'm always here.

Edit 2: Go to a camping or sports store or even some hardware type of place and get a wind up flashlight with electrical outlets on it. You can wind the handle to charge your phone in case of loss of electricity. This is a must and needs to be done asap so you can keep in contact. 




 If you can get to a gas station, you can lift the covers and drop a bucket into the underground tanks. They all have access covers so they can do dips to check the level in the holding tank. Usually on a far side of the parking lot without a lot of parking spaces around it. It's easier than siphoning but be careful of sparks or any source of ignition. 




 Keep in touch with the meatball guy and hang tough. It's gonna be okay. Find something to eat, try not to drink too much alcohol. Post a link to this story in the comments of the other one so we can keep of track of both.  




 Writing was good but I'm left very confused. 




 I thought I was the only one who still said stay frosty. 




 Upvote for relevant username/comment. Hand with claws, [TALON]company91 suggests other side of story. I read too much. Sorry. Still upvoting though because I talk too much. 




 I've eaten four gaviscon foam tab thingies in the last hour because of my incredible heartburn. Why the hell did I read this? 




 Please keep us updated with anything new OP! I don't think you're in any danger right now though. 




 Burn it. Burn it asap. Then salt the ashes. 




 Any news on your situation? If you're experiencing something similar you should post it/keep us updated so we can try to help. 




 Any news on your situation? 




 We only have to believe OP's stuff. Not random commenters with obviously fake stuff! 




 I wish. I can't wait much longer. 




 Chill out. They just meant that a lot of us just skim the "New" page and read the titles that stand out to us. That's all. No one is ignoring you and it's not that we don't care about your wife's welfare. We do. We just don't all see posts all the time. There's an online database of medical professionals who are lifestyle-friendly. Check out fetlife.com groups. Someone can ALWAYS help. Maybe you both should talk to someone. Good luck. I hope everything turns out okay. 




 What about telling us in some sort of coded message? Nosleepers are awesome at codes. Or even giving us the name of a piece of your art we could google to find your name and then go from there? Something not direct, something that may not work, ya know? I think anything is worth a shot at this point. Good luck OP. Stay safe. 




 So no mold then? :( 




 Oh. My. God. I haven't seen gibberish like that since the mold! And the title... ROT 13. No way.  




 Thank you! I knew there was something there! 




 In this vein I've also heard that sterling silver can help ward things off. Sterling jewelry is usually quite inexpensive and readily available. I can't speak to it's efficacy though, it's just something I've heard. 




 I actually agree with you 100%. My son is 7 and even for being really smart and witty, the kid just can not lie to me. He has said things a few times that I've had a hard time believing but he's almost always right about whatever it was. 

OP, I believe your daughter. Don't push about the mug. Ask her if her friends took the pictures, how she met them, when she sees them, etc. Maybe also don't leave the younger daughter alone with her for a little while, just in case. Not because she'll hurt her but because the friends might. 




 In fear of having weird stuff start happening to me, I'm too interested to not help.
The numbers. Has anyone looked at their cell phone lately? 5 (JKL) 6 (MNO) 1 is blank so a space I assume, and 2 (ABC).
Can anyone make a word or three words I guess out of those letters? Even if it's just a sound or something?

Edit: More thoughts.
The number is an OCLC number in the worldcat.org library system. It's for a mircofilm. I'm gonna include a link just in case Cymon and Iphigenia is somehow relevant. http://www.worldcat.org/title/cymon-and-iphigenia-painted-by-sir-frederick-leighton-the-story-of-the-picture-illustrated/oclc/561621561 




 I literally have no idea how to help you. But you really need to see a doctor about your sore. Please update us again soon. 




 Anything new in the last few hours? 




 Agreed! 




 Leopard print bandaid FTW! I thought I was paranoid too. 




 Yeah. I assumed they were drinking. The last guy talked about beer a fair bit in his comments. 




 Keep posting them here just make one account and get all your dates to post from the same one, in the same post. That way it looks like a "saga" and the mods don't delete it for not being a story. 

I like rules. They keep me from being dead. Unlike Eldon. And Warren. 




 I suggest if you have a message you'd like passed on to family or friends, you post it as a comment here and then shut down the account before she can.  




 Yeah. You're done for. Let us know if you make it out alive, but I have my doubts. 




 Oh my god. Men are idiots. 
We're not paranoid, we're trying to save you. 
You can get laid any time if you get out of there but you won't be fucking much if you're dead! 




 It's only been 46 minutes.... 




 Why wait? Why not just listen to us and get out of there? You're probably not even Eldon anymore. The winky face in the last post meant it was Mal posting. 




 I think I sped it up by trying to warn him. 
























 Can I just have your number in general? 




 There's a new one happening right now but it just... doesn't sound right. The tone is off I guess. I can't explain it. 




 Goodness. 




 Wooooowwwww. 




 Hang in there. I'm sure someone will find you. 




 Format please. Text block is really hard to read. I had a hard time with it with my own post but if you hit enter twice at the end of a paragraph you'll get the space you need.
Edit: Made it through. Put a salt circle around your bed and your son's rock and play. Update us asap please. :) 




 I had to read that a couple times to figure out what really happened. Holy shit. 




 Dude. Did you kill your wife or something...? Or are you just a big bully? 




 What's a shadowban? 




 I will take you at your word OP. What is your motivation for killing? You don't sound at all deranged or like you are having psychiatric problems. 




 Yeah we already established Clayton is immune. This doesn't have the normal tone of the mold stories to it. I wonder... Also if you kill/let someone else kill Clayton, you're screwed. And who is Rachel? 




 Which one?! I'm in Nova Scotia and it's awfully nice to see a fellow Canuck on here. 




 This advice is probably gonna get me all kinds of flack BUT when my insomnia got to the point I couldn't function and I was seeing stuff, I started smoking a joint before bed every night, taking a sleeping pill with a cup of tea, and listening to really quiet classical music til I fell asleep. I eventually weaned myself off the routine but I still struggle with getting to sleep. I hope you can beat this OP. 




 That would be terrifying. I'm really glad you made it home safe and sound.  




 I had no idea where this was going. Nice writing style OP.  




 I would have done worse than kick him. I get angry in traffic when people are acting stupid and I have my dog in the car.... I'm really glad both you and Belle are okay. Dogs may not be "worth more" than people but I can promise you I'd save my dog before I'd save a person. 




 Anyone crack the code? 




 This is fantastic. Can you tell us more about Iggy, like what you've been up ti with him since, and if Roy is doing well? Dean Koontz often writes abut dogs and I must say the humor and descriptions here really reminded me of him. 




 I've seen this posted and read this like 3 times now.  




 Mold mold mold. You can't fix it. Get your sister and your dog and RUN. 




 Any news OP? 




 My dad was a trucker. He did long-haul all through my childhood. I have the utmost respect for what you do. Please be damned careful in this town. 




 I got so excited I teared up.  




 OH MY GOD IT'S THE MOLD I COULD CRY!!!!!!!! 




 I don't think I've ever smoked up at 4:20pm or am. It was always at like lunch time during school, or 11 or 12 at night right before bed. 

OP, I've heard that if someone you know calls your name, you should wait until they do it a second time, because the first is the devil or something trying to get your attention.  As for the doorbell, I've had it happen a few times. Always when I'm distracted, and there's other noise happening. Never had an explanation for it though. 




 Was that a typo in the story? We're compiling a list of the mistakes to see if they mean anything. 




 Nothing creepy ever happens in Nova Scotia. All the creepy stuff is elsewhere. :( 




 I haven't figured out if they're important yet. Can you let me know what the typos you've found are? We're trying to make a list to see if it means anything. 




 I may have but don't remember. Is there something I should know/read for reference? 




 Porkchop I need to know more!!!!! 




 IT MIGHT BE THE MOLD DON'T ASK QUESTIONS JUST IN CASE HE GOES AWAY! 




 You can also spell anal. 




 Amazing work! Thank you so much for doing all of this.  




 In Death Agreement - Severity, it says "widow" instead of "window" and in Mr Poe of Newark, "crank" is suddenly spelled "crack." (That last one is an easy typo to make though and may not necessarily be one.) 




 You're welcome. I hope everything is alright after last night. Keep us updated and stay safe. 




 Yes! There seems to be one word or letter in each one! If you figure out what it says, can you reply here? I'm curious if it's just my own mind messing with me. 




 It could just be me. It's habit to look for messages. It's just that they're so well written any mistake seems deliberate, you know? In Back In The Alley there's a place where it says "of" but it should say "some." Also in that one, 6th paragraph, there's the word "bar" but the "a" is missing. If you come up with anything else, can you let me know?

 Motel sounds like a great plan, especially if the lights are out at home. You should be able to get bundled sage at any local occult shop but I'm not sure where else. You could try googling or searching Facebook for a local group that could help you. Wiccan groups, paranormal investigators, etc.  




 Have you found any pattern in the typos in each post? The stories are so well written something about the typos and mistaken words makes me feel like they're deliberate. 




 Salt circle around your bed, anywhere there's cracks, in doorways and windows, burn sage and waft the smoke all around your house. Start wearing a piece of sterling silver on your person. Update soon please. 




 Someone more patient than me needs to go through all these stories and see if the odd out of place words and typos are a message. They're too well written, the screw ups seem deliberate. 




 Has anyone else noticed the random typos? After reading the mold stories I'm like trained to see mistakes as hidden messages. This one says "of" instead of what I assume would be "some," and another one had an "are" in a place it didn't belong. 




 More please! I wanna know! 




 Awesome story OP. Your writing style is really engaging and easy to read. I've often heard that staring at your reflection too long will cause you to see things you don't want to see.  




 There's more? 




 I'm sorry OP. That happened to me a long time ago. PM me if you ever need to talk. 




 Hey OP any news? You doing alright? 
























 I actually might give this a shot. Sleep doesn't come easy here. 




 This isn't how nosleep works. The rules are in the sidebar.  




 Y'all okay? 




 This is why I have a dog. She barks at everything and sure sometimes that gets annoying but I'm secure knowing nothing will ever get to me without her letting me know first. 




 Hey R4R! I'm short and often grouchy and easily creeped out, and I need friends! Maybe more than friends? But mostly just friends. Anyone local? Male or female. I like working on cars, beer, bacon, boobs, baking, books, nail polish, knitting, and my dog.  




 "Chortle" made me chortle. 




 Update soon! 




 Spill the beans OP! We can probably help you but only if we have the full story. 




 Your mom may just be sticking around to keep an eye on you and the house. How long until you turn 18? I'd move in there ASAP if I were you. Just keep an eye out for anything out of the ordinary that feels threatening. 




 I really enjoy your writing. If you have more experiences, you should post them. How is your wife doing now? 




 No one ever looks for those girls. 
Queen street, Toronto? 




 Holy crap. This must be terrifying for you. 




 Best comment ever.  




 And um... "suicided?" I picture this being written in crayon by that mean kid who picks on everyone else, and his older brother let him on nosleep to scare the shit out of him. 




 It's the ring.  




 In the fall I had a feeling my ex's (who I'm still VERY weirdly close with) girlfriend was pregnant. Sure enough he told me she was. I looked at my mum that day and said "He's not gonna be a dad." I had no idea what I meant at the time but I had this feeling that something bad was going to happen. About 6 weeks later he told me she had had a miscarriage. 

Also ever since I had surgery in December I seem to be seeing things in corners and blurry places here and there and the odd shadow with no cause. Something about being put under I think. 




 Anyone else read this, hoping for the mold? 




 Same here actually. My grandad's family used to just KNOW stuff and in the last few months I've found myself KNOWING things I have no possible way of knowing. We're also prone to seeing people in places they aren't. I basically got a dog for the express purpose of letting me know when the people I see are real. 




 Happy birthday! :) You are brave and brilliant and loved. 




 Seconded. Also the reason I don't put my dog outside unsupervised. 




 I expect I'll have a baby on Friday the 13th. Hopefully the Calusari aren't hanging around. No patience for grouchy old Romanian men. 




 I'm working really hard on convincing myself they're not. I was waiting outside the recovery room for a friend after major surgery this week and kept seeing people/whatever in the hallway out of the corner of my right eye. There was no one there. It was bad. At home I'm mostly just seeing blurry spots/shadows and my cats are wild all the time. My therapy dog can't be bothered with it though I've noticed she sleeps a lot closer to me at night now. 




 Holy. Shit. Coat hanger.  




 How to freak out someone who had surgery a while ago and since sees blurry things in corners: THIS. Keep us updated OP. 




 CALL THE COPS! No one ever thinks to call the cops. 




 Thank you, captain obvious. Also, fork off.  




 Boy that was helpful. 




 This was incredible. Props OP. I don' think I blinked the whole time I was reading. 




 Business idea: open Etsy shop selling different shapes/sizes/styles of tinfoil hats. Split profits? 




 Have you ever learned more about your parents? Tell us more! 




 Death, bro. Death. 




 MORE!!! 




 Commenting before reading because was 100% listening to Jar of Hearts while scrolling /nosleep new stories. Creepy. 




 Your girlfriend's name isn't Steph is it? 




 I find passing out is almost involuntary for me after a big adrenaline rush, if that explains the sleeping at all. 




 I might never sleep again... 




 Take the cat. 




 I think they were asking if the safe contents were pictures of mob-guy's hits. I can't be positive though obviously. 




 Fantastic! So long as he's healthy, protein is protein. 




 Be careful not to overfeed poor Baxter. Too much meat can upset his stomach. ;) 




 I second the bruise thing. I have one on the top of my foot and one on the  side of my forearm and NO idea where they came from. I blame them all on the guy I hang out with but I don't think they've ever actually been his fault, they just appear. 




 Any news? How is he doing? 




 Are you in Nova Scotia? You described yourself and one of your friends EXACTLY like my best friend and his girlfriend. Her name is even Rachel and she's a ginger. 




 Mine too! 




 Hey OP. I'm a nanny and I've had a lot of strange experiences. One thing I've learned is if you want people to believe you, you need to take videos or pictures and hand them over to someone who can be objective. You could consider wall mounted baby monitors or a camcorder on a tripod, or even a cell phone video. You could also try a line of salt or brick dust at your doorway to see if she can cross it, and I would get in touch with the priest as soon as you can. Something else to consider, for someone who may be a bit more open minded, you could try contacting your local paranormal society. It seems most places have them and they can usually be contacted via facebook or a local shop. Good luck and keep us updated.  




 I swear when I was in emerg for my gall bladder, I was a little high on pain meds and saw a bubble and FREAKED OUT til the nurse explained it to me. It's a pretty widely held belief! 




 I may be. Or I may not. It all depends on your response. 




 It's... The Strangest Load I Ever Pulled. I think? Or something like that. It just sounds wrong to me.
