 I believe it was a 5 hour session if I remember correctly. I did go back for a 1 hour touch up after all the healing. 




 Here's mine. I basically just took the album that inspired me the most and went with something from it.

 Dude. That is also a very well done job. I really like it. Calgary Ocular Orifice tats all the way. 




 Haha definitely bumped into you. Was an awesome show. 




 Sweet dude, thanks! 




 I had posters I was guarding with my life so I stayed back and head banged my neck stiff. 





























 I simply would like to know in what order have the bands been playing. I am attending tomorrow nights show, and I really would like to catch the faceless. Between getting off work and putting my son to bed I know I'll be running a little late. Thanks in advance, I am so stoked for tomorrow. 







































 Personally I'd love to see Construct and Avalanche, so many great memories on both. Big Team CTF on Avalanche was always my favorite map and game type combination. Also getting those easy grav lift grenade to head shot kills on Construct was too much fun, I could have done that all day. 

What does everyone else think? 









































































































































































 [Needless to say, this is now mine](http://i.imgur.com/PdUl5uT.jpg)

Took sometime to clean it up, but worth it. 

























































































 [Blair posted this blurb today.](http://www.toolband.com/index_frames.html)


**FIRST "OPIATE" PRIZE WINNER?**

**It would appear that some lucky individual has won the first 'golden ticket' ("SEAL OF XATANITOS"), that was included in one of the first hundred or so 21st anniversary OPIATE CD packages that have been shipped out. From what I've been told, the winning 'seal' was inserted into the variation colored grayish-silver. Once I get all the details from Merch, I will post the name of the winner along with his or her photo.**


Looks like we'll find out what those seals are pretty soon.

EDIT: the greyish-silver is the [second variation](http://imgur.com/a/uSWpI) from what I can see. 







































 So I'm putting together a slideshow for my Mother's 75th birthday this year and I found an old picture that needs a little help. If anyone could help I'd really appreciate it, thanks reddit.

[http://i.imgur.com/EkFszJI.png](http://i.imgur.com/EkFszJI.png) 




 So I went to see one of my all time favorites tonight, Animals As Leaders, during their supporting show for Meshuggah here in Calgary, Alberta. Grabbed my tickets, got inside and got a beer. As the guy poured my beer he commented on what was supposed to be tonight's short concert. Asking why, he explained that Tosin of AAL tried to break up a fight in Boston between a cop and a rowdy concert goer, that turned out to be an obstruction of justice charge apparently. I couldn't fucking believe it.
So pissed I sold my tickets and left like a sulking baby. So heads up for anyone else anticipating an upcoming Animals As Leaders show in Canada.

**tl;dr** Animals As Leaders forbidden to travel internationally for the time being.

Edit: It was Javier Reyes, and not Tosin Abasi. Thanks Triangular_Desire. 




 "Hold On" was featured. Thought it was suiting. Thoughts? 














 So I'm looking for a picture of [Jamie Foxx](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aK8sF75Y5xE/UMYD0U80luI/AAAAAAAAK_Q/vFkeZOqDNis/s1600/jamie-foxx-surreal4real-charity-event-02.jpg) colored white (kind of like the Wayans brothers from the terrible movie [white chicks](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381707/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)) and dressed up as Dexter doing something [Dexter](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2008/09/09/dexter460.jpg) would do. Can anybody help? It doesn't have to include the pictures I've linked.

EDIT: I promise not to repost it to /r/dexter as my own work. I legitimately want to get my friend going.  









 THIS IS AMAZING AMIRITE? 






















































 AMIRITE? I MEAN ALL COMPLAINING ASIDE, THESE ARE THE BEST MAPS TO COME WITH HALO 4 MULTIPLAYER, BUT WHY THE FUCK DO THEY KEEP GETTING VOTED IN? 




 [Here's his picture](http://i.imgur.com/GT8qe.jpg), any and all suggestions/help would be appreciated. He's a buddy of mine, and these posters will have to go up at here at work so SFW would be best. Thanks so much Reddit! 









 I have zero Photoshop capabilities, so I thought I would reach out to the Reddit community for some help to make these pictures a little more hilarious than they already are. I know they are kind of blurry, sorry about that.

[Picture #1](http://i.imgur.com/kdyaX.jpg)
[Picture #2](http://i.imgur.com/xAPMb.jpg)

Any help would be greatly appreciated! 




 Does anyone have any that I can download? I know the search function for this is kind of hooped for the time being, but I'm aware that searching VIA gamer tags works. I'm looking for all and everything, especially Team Snipers. Any recommendations?  




 So I flew through Toronto to catch a Tool show on my way back from vacation in 2009. I was seated next to another dude flying solo at the show, he ended up taking a bunch of pictures, I asked him to email them to me and he came through, stand up fellow. [Thought I'd share.](http://imgur.com/a/sLvvN) 

It was your [standard 10000 Days setlist](http://toolnavy.com/showthread.php?t=114069). Also, [this](http://i.imgur.com/St1as.jpg) is the poster from the show, might be my favorite from the three I have.

Yeah some of them are blurry, but there are a few nice one's in there. Unfortunately this is the best resolution I have.

 














 Has anyone made the joke "it's been 10000 days since their last album" yet?  



















 Am I the only one that thinks halo 4 multiplayer is vastly similar the Call of Duty series? I was never a fan of those games for many reasons, 1) Unfair advantages among players due to tactical load outs 2) Point count for wins 3) Weapon markers 4) Ordinance. This game may look/play nice but it's so far from halo that I find myself quite turned off, I miss that level playing field we all once had, where the good gained advantage with knowledge. Anyways just my two cents. Just curious if I am alone on this. Oh I forgot to mention the sounds, every standard halo noise is basically gone. 









 After the birth of my son 11 weeks ago I've been somewhat out of the halo loop, I'm on right now and noticed the anniversary big team playlist is no longer available. Why did I buy them if I can't play them, am I missing something? 


































 Hey everyone, I'm at a loss as to where I'm supposed to turn next so I thought I would try r/newfoundland. My wonderful mother 74 years of age was a victim of robbery this past week. She has never been an overly wealthy woman, using what little wealth she has to support her very large family. Her house is small and quaint and doesn't contain many valuables (her television is tubed and her stereo is 15 plus years old, among the rest of her things that were left behind by the thieves). She has always been content with her humbled life and the only valuables she's ever really had came in the form of a few small rings passed down through the generations of our family. These rings of course hold no real monetary value (very small weight in gold), but the sentiments they hold in my mothers heart are unmatched. 

I know this is such a long shot but if anyone has seen or heard anything in regards to breaking and entering and the sale of used jewelry on the streets in the Grand Falls area, could you please let me or the police know. It would mean so much to her to actually retrieve these small items and/or see the culprits brought to justice.

I completely understand that there are problems in our society, and that drug addiction among other things, can bring people to carry out the unspeakable, but it breaks my heart knowing that there are those who prey on the elderly. It's about time these actions are taken seriously by the system, and the law works in favor of the victims.

If by some even slimmer chance someone who was directly involved manages to read this, if you somehow still have my mothers jewelry and have it in you to return it, I will most certainly not pursue this any further, I would walk away knowing that all hope isn't lost. I would forgive you personally, and I will hold that gesture in such high regard for the rest of my time on this earth. I do not wish to seek revenge, but to make things right.

If you think you might know something and require further description please PM me.

Thank you for your time. 










































































 Came here to state this. For a second there I thought I somehow resubscribed. 




 I thought the same thing haha. 




 Cool thanks. 




 Damn, what a beautiful piece of work. You're a lucky dude/dudette. 




 Where does one acquire such a thing?  









 I just finally received a shipment confirmation email with a tracking number. Package is currently in Richmond, BC and is to make it to Calgary by Friday apparently. $65 brokerage fee? Wut? 




 Would you happen to be outside the US? 




 Never rely on hitler for anything. 




 Has anyone outside the USA received their box set yet? I am in Canada and still without mine and my wife's Christmas gift. Just curious, thanks.
 




 Yes. Then I would buy it when it came out. 




 Damnit, where did the time go? 




 BTBAM - The Parallax II

NIN - Hesitation

Deafhaven - Sunbather   









 Nice, thanks for the info! 




 So how's the DVD quality? 




 WiFiday The 13th. 




 Also, awesome username! 




 I bet /r/horror would enjoy this, definitely cross post it over there. Good work, looks awesome. 




 Me as well I would like to know. 




 Thanks, really looking forward to it now. 




 Goddamn that's nice. Did they give you an email when they shipped it? I'm still waiting on mine. Also, I'm in Canada so not sure if it'll take much longer. It's supposed to be the Christmas gift for my wife and I. 




 Best username for this comment. 




 I'm sorry. 




 My friend just sent me this link:

[http://www.redflagnews.com/environment-headlines/urgent-two-radcon-5-alerts-on-west-coast-within-48-hours-disturbing-video#sthash.r5bcV4br.dpbs](http://www.redflagnews.com/environment-headlines/urgent-two-radcon-5-alerts-on-west-coast-within-48-hours-disturbing-video#sthash.r5bcV4br.dpbs)

And I got to thinking that something seems awfully fear mongering about that video which leads me to believe there is some kind of hidden agenda. Not to say that nuclear waste seeping into the ocean isn't a huge concern for every person on the planet right now, but something about that video didn't seem right to me.

I just wanted some sort of scientific take on the matter. How imminently fucked are we really? Can it be contained? Does it require more attention from the world than it is getting? 

Thanks in advance.

 




 William Peter Blatty's "The Exorcist" and "Legion". I loved both of these. 




 [Okay](http://i.imgur.com/yZDgZJt.png) 




 That's not the point. I wasn't trying to promote self loathing here, more the idea of self realization, in that you are among the masses creating the traffic problem. It's a humbling and calming gesture to understand that every single person on the road around you would like to get home as badly as yourself. When the roads are as bad as they are we owe it to ourselves and each other to exercise extra precaution, and seeing each vehicle as another human being can help alleviate some of that anxiousness and frustration. I find that it works for me anyways, it's easy to ignore the thoughts and feelings of those around you when you're separated by metal cages.    




 That is awesome.

 [We're in this together](http://youtu.be/P9BfvPjsXXw)
 




 [Although I don't find his music overly relevant anymore, this song still gets me.](https://youtu.be/Rthl_O4_G2o) 




 - New inexperienced drivers

- People with zero winter condition experience (from warmer climates)

- Impatient ~~20 something~~ people with giant 4x4 trucks who think they can         stop as fast as the can accelerate

- Old people/nervous drivers white knuckled at the first sight of moisture (this could go back to my first point)

- Tailgaters

- Insufficient snow clearing of Calgary roads

- Overpopulation (road design doesn't match population boom)

To me it's everyone in unison forming one giant problem. We are all to blame, whether or not you're the perfect driver, you're still in traffic, which to me makes you part of the problem. 

Just like the idea of the zipper merge on an engineer's notebook, it looked great on paper but as soon as you throw a bunch of different personalities behind it, it becomes a cluster fuck. I think patience for one another is the key to making our [drive time commute](http://youtu.be/Dvx5GL_9MD0) a little more tolerable.

I have to agree with /u/Ardal and the police on this matter. Let's all slow the fuck down, take a breath, and let's get home in one piece without having to call our insurance companies.

 









 Nice man, I almost didn't buy it so glad that I did. 




 This was the funniest comment I've read all day. I don't actually laugh out loud very often. 




 Hello Mr. Reznor.

First off I would like to simply say thank you, your music has accompanied me throughout the past 19 years of my life, I am a huge fan and very grateful for the wonderful music you have brought into this world.

1) As a new father my life has literally changed a great deal (for the better). I wanted to know how you deal with being away from your children while on tour, and how else being a father affects your career.

~~2) This question has probably been asked more times than anything else but here goes, I know that both you and Maynard came to an agreement that tapeworm wasn't ranked as a 10/10 by your standards, however, will we ever see a collaboration between you guys in the future? Do you guys keep in touch, and/or humor this idea?~~


Thanks for dropping by.

EDIT: Please ignore question two.
 




 [I imagine it would be a lot like the covenant from Halo.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_(Halo) 




 Either or, I am willing to drive to dreadmonton. 




 If they came to Calgary I would be so happy. 














 What power? 




 Instantly reminded of these guys.

 [Evergreen Terrace - Everlong](http://youtu.be/zZ2iw-kaa-k) 




 Very well put together argument. 




 Awesome brother! Glad it all worked out. Again sorry we got split up at the end. Enjoy the gold! Tell me what it does actually because I'd love to know haha. 




 First off I want to give much thanks to /u/Xenophorge for the FREE floor ticket so that a friend of mine could make it, the four of us had a great time. I'd post the reddit love story picture, but I don't want to commit to putting my face on these parts just yet.

Having said that I want to say the show was fucking awesome, setlist had a little more top 40 than I would have liked but I could definitely live with it. The highlights for me without a doubt [Pino Palladino's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pino_Palladino) performance, the guy fucking nailed it and did it with such class and style. I really thought he fit the bill perfectly. Everyone seemed spot on and enthusiastic, however you could definitely sense how the tour was wrapping up though, almost as a sigh of relief from each performer. I won't say they were lacking energy, but  there was a definite aura of depletion in the air, in that each member was looking forward to resuming their family/home life.

I don't know if as a result of this the light show suffered a little or not. But we seemed to have missed out on a lot of the 3D effects that I have been seeing around these parts as of late. All in all it was amazing and I wouldn't have traded it for anything. 

Trent will never cease to amaze me as an artist, musician, and front man. The fact that he has managed to keep NIN relevant throughout my early teenage years and well into my adulthood blows me away. I hope he stays with us for decades to come. 

That is all /r/NIN, I just wanted to share a few quick thoughts with you. I love to hear what you guys think as well.

 




 Yeah it was a gift, and due to our dry climate here they don't last very long. It was out of the box for less than 12 hours. 




 Canada. 














 Damn. 




 [What's wrong with Autolux?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilzH4eco7lA) 




 Decent argument and perspective. 




 I'm glad I'm not the only one to notice. See you around. 




 Yeah, it really should be /r/townies. 




 Me too. 




 Sure, it's all good. My shark moose post was just the most recent to spark my attention. It's really not about what I post, but mostly what others do. I lurk here for the most part, and I rarely ever go to the front page of this sub, so if I made a repost as my argument point then I really only have myself to blame for that. Having said that though, this has been something I've noticed for over a year now. Again, maybe I only check in at the wrong times or something, in the end I find this place uneventful and boring, with a lot of downvote trolls. Is it just me or do very relevant comments  garner downvotes? I don't get it, like most subs there has to be a moment of self realization that the downvote button isn't a disagree button, perhaps this one has yet to understand that. 




 rant Yes /r/Newfoundland, I'm talking about you. I've been subbed since the beginning of my reddit life, and in that time I've noticed the horrible trend that established itself here as the norm. Seemingly every post I see that actually has to do with Newfoundland current events, culture, or politics becomes a barren waste land of downvotes and ignorance. I don't think I've come across one thought provoking comment section to date. Yet, when a fucking cartoon like Christmas tree from the goddamn Avalon mall gets posted, watch out, something all the St. John's yuppies can relate to. It's obvious who runs this place, and it's too bad. Much like Newfoundland itself, where 90% of the island is overlooked because of loud mouth St. John's walking around distracting everyone from what else is happening. Seriously, A POST ABOUT A GREENLAND SHARK CHOKING ON A MOOSE GETTING SAVED BY TWO RANDOM GUYS GOT DOWNVOTED BUT THAT GODDAMN CHRISTMAS TREE SPARKED DISCUSSION AND NOSTALGIA. Sorry, didn't mean to yell, but that was the last straw. I'll check back in a few years and see if you got your shit together. /rant 









 I have a friend who may want to come, please stand by. 




 Went to Michael's. They're matted 22x28 frames I think. 




 Got them at the show I attended. 









 Hey thanks. It cost a pretty penny but worth every cent. 




 So what you're saying is the Avalon Mall is as important and iconic to the rest of Newfoundland and its people as it is to all the local yuppies? Yes, downvote for criticism I get it. 









 And here I am... 




 CTRL+F "Yo d..", ah, there it is. 




 I see. 




 Ok, so I'm a Newfoundlander living away from Newfoundland (big surprise I know), I was just curious as to what I'm missing here and what this could possibly have to do with Newfoundland.

EDIT: Typical r/newfoundland, point out how a post has nothing to do with Newfoundland and get downvoted.  









 Ok, I'm sorry. 




 I am in western Canada, and I love it here.

EDIT: Oil and gas is huge here, and I know that will always be a viable option. I'm really looking to keep my ear to the ground for new up and coming industries that I could possibly get into. 




 I'm a 31 year old licensed airframe worker that has been in my trade for 10 years, things are looking pretty grim in my industry and it may be time for a move in the next year or so. If I am to make a move, I want to make sure it's a smart one and in the right direction, with job stability for at least the next 40 years. I have a hands on skills with precision tooling, and mathematics has always been my area of interest. Although I don't feel it is necessary to continue working in the trades, I am also not opposed to it. 

I'd really love reddit's opinion on the matter.
 




 Dude, I'm sorry. 




 Bah 




 It's solid brass though, and it was a gift as well haha. 




 Hah! 




 It ain't easy being Canadian. 




 Absolutely, much appreciation went out to those behind it. 




 Yes, and he tripped and fell on his ass trying to get in. 




 Much force was needed to secure it together, the secret was to apply this force throughout the entire build so that everything sat flush and level as possible. 




 Probably magnesium, copper, and tungsten.  




 Hah, thanks, you too. Although this post was made late yesterday and my birthday is now over. 




 More images:

 Yes it is megabloks. As far as I know the Halo franchise teamed up with them as opposed to Lego. After building this thing I thought the quality was great even though most opinions usually say otherwise.  




 No he doesn't, sorry dude. 




 Hey thanks. 









 Haha wow. Thanks! 




 [Here's the picture.](http://i.imgur.com/LRERSVm.png) 




 Hey thanks a lot, I will try and swing by tonight and check out both stores. 




 [I agree](http://i.imgur.com/3EOUqnC.png) 




 Hey thanks! 




 Me either. 




 Hey thanks a lot! 




 Thanks a lot, I was thinking they were a bit pricey. 




 Beautiful. 




 Sweet baby Jesus, thank you. 




 I much rather save the time and spend hard earned money. 




 Sigh. 




 I know the ugly Christmas sweater fad has pretty much run it's course over the years, but I would love to look as Christmassy as possible for my company party. Thanks for any help in advance! 




 Excellent pick. At the Heart of it All is a great choice. 




 Quake soundtrack maybe? 




 /r/gore

There you go you depraved sick fuck. 




 I shan't feed the trolls anymore. 




 Not really, just read the full synopsis of A Serbian Film, and the August Underground series. 




 Thank you. 




 The question: "Hello fellow horror lovers, have you any recommendations for something more depraved than AU or ASF?"

My answer: "Yeah, they're called snuff and child pornography"

TL;DR: The only thing more depraved than those movies (in my mind) would be the true horrors of real life. I believe you read my reply out of context.
 




 I'm sick for mentioning it? Says the guy looking for something more shocking and "ate up" than the infamous "baby" scene of ASF. How depraved do your horror movies have to be before it's reality, this is the basic point I am making. There's a fine line between art and an obsession with death. 




 Yeah, they're called snuff films and child pornography. Why the hell do you need more hardcore than either of those? I haven't seen them, but a quick read of their synopsis is enough to make me sick to my stomach. 




 I really don't know much about how law works, and I know a quick google search would give me the courts definition of "sane". However how does it make any sense that a human capable of murder, rape, dismemberment, cannibalization, and attempted zombification can be considered anything but bat shit crazy? I mean I get that he was well aware of his actions entitling his "sane" verdict, but I find the whole thing confusing. 




 This is the worst fan sub of all time, did you really expect an answer? 




 This picture actually made me laugh, thanks for that. I found your dog reminded me of [this guy](http://m.imgur.com/ME0q6h3). 

You should post him to /r/photoshopbattles. 









 Wow, this is really interesting. Thanks for the info! 




 I have that same "I want to believe" poster. I thought it was some kind of rip off of the one seen in [Mulder's office](http://biglight.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/MuldersOffice.gif). I wonder what the story is behind it. 




 Nasty little buggers. 









 Thanks anyway, good luck. 




 I know a guy who would kill for a floor seat in Calgary. I live here so if you had one I'd meet you.

EDIT: realized how insane that comment sounded after I wrote it. Seriously, my buddy has never seen them, and missed out on the floor ticket sales. 




 Yeah just pop the multiplayer disc in anytime you want to play halo 3 multiplayer. 




 Don't buy the DLC, I'm sure you can find a copy of Halo 3 ODST for cheaper than what Microsoft is selling the DLC for. All halo 3 multiplayer DLC comes with the Halo 3 ODST disc. 




 Hahaha. This is the best comment I've ever read. 




 I would like to say Heat. It's not scary, but I find it super intense, which is really the secondary wavelength of fear, enticing you in much the same way.

[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113277/?ref_=nv_sr_3](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113277/?ref_=nv_sr_3) 









 I know, it's fucking scary to think that us humans are capable of such atrocities. With all of our technological advancements and general understanding of our universe, it's almost hard to believe. Like anything I guess, it can be defective. The human brain that we are gifted unfortunately doesn't come with a warrenty, it's up to the rest of us to sort out these crossed wires. 




 I think I'm going to be sick. 
























 Yes, I have become self aware. 




 Perhaps yeah. I'm going to estimate 1993 - 1994. 




 I feel this has become a very hilarious game of "Guess Who?", good fun old chap. 




 I need an adult. 




 Low attention span I believe.  




 Wat. 




 Go fish. 




 I know the type you're talking about, I think everyone in the industry will meet a few quantity over quality people during their aviation travels. Which of course is very unfortunate. Hope it all works out for you.  




 I'd love to order a print of this. I feel like this is the second time I wrote this comment to this picture in this sub. Dj vu. Anyone know the original photographer? 




 Very cool. 




 Thank you, and I hope you get to fly one as well. Good luck. 




 That's very interesting. Did you work on the original Twin Otters by any chance? 




 When and why did you make the switch? 




 Will do, thanks for the support! 




 A wise mechanic once put skydiving in perspective for me, "Why would you jump out of a perfectly good airplane? Even if this thing is on fire, let's ride it out a little and see where it goes." 




 Yes it is, the Calgary division. 




 I've never been on one, but I hear they're awesome. 




 Ha! No I am not, I assure you I am in the picture but wish to remain anonymous. I've never posted my face to reddit before, so I imagine this will be the closest I will get.  









 I used to have a large array of handles, but my main one was "Iceman". Thought I'd see if there are anymore of you out there. 




 Done and done, thank you! 




 Goddamnit I love Tina. She has to be one of the best characters on animated television. I feel star struck on the Internet now, thanks.  I just want to say thank you so much for the entertainment and please keep doing what you're doing, Bob's Burgers is awesome. How can I get an autograph from Tina? 
 




 NOoooooooooooOOOoooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!! 









 Unfortunately I cannot shed light on the quality, as I've only just begun collecting my favourite albums on vinyl and have not yet invested in a setup. This of course is something I want to do right and make sure I am financially prepared so it'll be a ways away. All I can tell you is Diamond Eyes is on white vinyl and that it was indeed the 85 dollar bundle (95 Canadian for myself).

EDIT: I believe they are all 180 gram. 









 [The article](http://wtop.com/256/3574525/Texting-walking-more-risky-than-distracted-driving) 









 This will definitely garner downvotes but ever since I've watched the True Detective series, looking back on Dexter is like trying to remember the plot of an Archie comic. 




 Cool shots, thanks for sharing. Didn't see any of Pino. Did he not tour this leg? I really love his style, was hoping he would be a permenant any member. 




 I too, choose to believe this happened. Amazing. 









 Interesting.  




 Thanks man, I've been waiting for this bundle to pop up again. Just placed my order. 









 Nice try officer.

EDIT: Minus Police. 




 I received "Closing Time" as a Christmas present one year. As a result whenever I listen to it I'm reminded of early evenings with wine and cigarettes in the snow.

EDIT: Redundancy. 




 I've always wanted to find the time to make a compilation of every time Scully's eye twitches. This is also good, thanks! 




 [Jacob's Ladder.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099871/)

EDIT: I should add this is one of my all time favourite movies, not just as a horror either. It's from 1990, but holds up really well IMO.
 









 Yeah I hear you. I'm looking forward to it. 




 Grand is an excellent description. 




 Stinkfist. 

My favourite single. 

Spookiest. Grittiest. Most surreal. 




 I think [HR Giger](http://www.hrgiger.com) would also be a phenomenal choice. 




 I'd love to see it happen, although yes I know it's highly unlikely.

That's what I meant by that statement, I probably should have been more descriptive. 




 Definitely not against this idea. 




 I'm a fan of Alex Grey's work, don't get me wrong, but I just really love Aenima's style the most. I'd love to see it happen, although yes I know it's highly unlikely. Thoughts? 




 Me too, it's quickly moving up the ladder of my favourite APC tracks.  




 I start my work day every morning at 6AM with this song and a cup of joe. Actually makes it bearable. 




 I just wanted to say that I think the live version of "when the levee breaks" on Stone   Echo is goddamn fucking amazing.

That is all. 




 On the link you posted. 




 Ah, no I haven't. Thanks for the heads up. 




 CTRL+F a few key words I wrote with no results. Will it be updated? 




 It's Wednesday. 




 I would frame this if I knew where to get it. 




 Hey thanks for that. I'm prepared for the massive crowd and long line ups, at least I think I am. Either way, getting my evil dead poster signed is more important to me than actually meeting him. I guess I'll just have to wait and see. 




 Yeah it can be very tiring carrying a 30 pound kid everywhere. Especially for my poor pregnant wife at 7 months when I'm not around, essentially carrying two kids every time she has to leave the house.  




 I am strictly speaking from a Canadian stand point, I usually have the opposite problem as yourself, this is of course assuming you're American. 




 Thanks. 




 Hey thanks for the info. I'll look into it. 




 Nope, I'm talking Calgary. But I'm sure it's the kind of tour or setup.  




 Not sure if this is the appropriate sub for this or not, but the one and only Bruce Campbell will be at this years comic con and I'm a huge evil dead fan. This was enough to spark my interest and get me really excited about attending this year. Now I should add that I've never attended one of these before so please forgive my noobishness. 

I'd really like to know what Bruce is like for those of you whom have met him, I am not really the nervous type but have a feeling he'll set me back a step. More importantly what's the etiquette for getting stuff signed? Can you bring more than one item if any at all? Or do they make you purchase while inside?

I think that about sums it up, it's going to be really cool to meet a guy like Bruce, even if it is only for a minute. Thanks in advance dreddit. Again sorry if wrong sub. 
 




 Dude, I've had a girl tell me this exact same thing, then even go as far as naming the baby girl after my Mother. I didn't think I could afford a paternity test at the time, and thought it wasn't worth it because you know, she named her after my mom and all. My brother who was much more established than I was at the time insisted on paying for the test, lo and behold the baby wasn't mine. I was surprised at first even though it was only a one night stand deal that turned into a few more times afterwards, but apparently this chick was going through a really bad break up and this was her way of coping, obviously not filling me in on the details.

Either way, I didn't mean to bore you with the details seeing how you are probably in a much different situation, but goddammit, that paternity test changed my life. Please do yourself the favor before doing anything else.

That was 11 years ago and I am currently happily married with an 18 month old boy, and a girl on the way. I'm really not sure if any of that would have come to fruition had I taken her word for it. Speaking of which, I should call my brother, what an awesome guy.

EDIT: Grammar. 

EDIT: Spelling. 




 My son is about to turn 18 months next week and he still doesn't walk. He did however start the spider walk yesterday (feet flat on the floor, legs straight, and moving forward with his hands) so I'm hoping that's a good sign. I was having this same question/thought plague my mind the other day, and I keep asking myself if I am doing anything wrong. 

On that note, it sounds like your son is doing fine, the whole army crawling thing is just another variation of crawling I believe, I watched a niece of mine develop the same way and she turned out to be a very smart and sweet little girl (age 7 now). I remember thinking it was peculiar, but it was just another developmental step before she was up and running. Otherwise everything else sounds right on par. Enjoy it while you can, babies are so sweet, I will miss these days I just know it. 




 Interesting. Tis a shitty situation she put you guys in, hopefully she'll cool off enough so you can track her down. 




 I do not personally know or have I communicated with your sister, however I would probably start with her account history, to see if any of the information she's posted in the last while makes any sense to you or the rest of your family. Good luck. 




 Pretty sure this is as high res as it gets.

 Yeah, USPS is a pile of horse shit. 




 Would it be possible for you to transfer those to imgur? The Facebooks are blocked at my work place, and I am a very impatient person. If not no worries, thanks. 



















 Nice thanks OP! 




 This is what I do when I laugh on the internet ---- "hahahaha". I'm never sure if it comes off as sincere or not. 




 Surely op will deliver. 




 I too am having this problem. What the hell? 














 Totally what I meant to say. 




 Quoting ~~hooker with a penis~~ aenima in a tattoo thread on /r/toolband.

EDIT: Brain fart. 




 PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!! 




 May I too have the recipe when you wake up, these look amazing. Thank you. 









 I know, tool putting their twist on that song would fucking intense. 




 [Echoes](http://youtu.be/uJtw7SP0oN4) 




 Congratulations man, that's huge news!
 




 Thank you very much, I hope my little angel will be as observant as yours! 




 I've also heard of this method, but am very reluctant to use it. Although it may be effective, I don't want my child to associate me with physical pain. 




 I try asking him what's wrong, but he doesn't really have a grasp of the English language yet, only uses a few words. But I make sure to talk to him as much as I can, pointing and naming everything in sight. I'm hoping for that language explosion any day now. 

As for stomping feet he still doesn't walk, however when he gets frustrated with his toys for whatever reason he will let out a squeal and throw a small tantrum until one of us can help him out. 




 We more or less do this now, I guess persistence is the name of the game. Thanks! 




 I have no idea honestly, it seems to be some sort of play fighting. I know his intent is fairly harmless, but it needs to stop either way. He is a really active child, we have a hard time keeping up with him, he has no interest in television and loves to drive his cars around on the floor and dance to music, I doubt it's an surplus of energy. I'm hoping it's some sort of phase that will dissipate as he develops his sense of empathy. 




 This sounds like a much better process than my current voice raising. It breaks my heart because he pouts when I tell him what he's doing wrong. I know he doesn't know any better and that he may even have a hard time understanding me, and that this is method I use probably isn't going to be effective in the long term. 

Thanks so much for your thoughtful reply, I will definitely try it out. 




 Hello /r/parenting, I'm so glad I found you this past week. I can tell I have much to learn from you guys and I look forward to growing with you. Having said that, I am new to fatherhood with my 17 month old son, and his soon to be born baby sister. So far I am having a blast, with all the ups and downs, all I know is I wouldn't change it for the world and that this has been the best experience of my life so far.

The reason I come to you guys with this post is that currently my son has started to hit really hard, he has always had a thing for pulling my wife's hair, but now he's doing both to us. I really don't know how to react when he does this, should I be firm and tell him no? Or should we try not to draw any attention to it. So far I've been doing my best to make him understand that it hurts and that he shouldn't do it, but it's seemingly having no effect.

I'd really like to know how to deal with this especially before our little girl enters the situation and becomes another victim. Thank you so much for any help you can offer.  




 There's always a way, I have seen Jurassic Park 34+ times. 




 Yeah, I'd say when the day comes I require its services, it'll be all fixed up. 




 J'ai mang une motoneige avec des poissons? 




 Wow, what is this world coming to? 




 Probably not an intended media server, but a little go get'em attitude can fix that. PS3 wasn't an intended media server either, but it's probably my favourite one I've ever owned up to this point. 




 Fucking halo made me get the Xbone, even though it isn't even out yet. Regardless, when my PS3 dies as my current media server, and the price is right, I'll replace it with the PS4.

The fact that they are both lack backwards compatibility really irks me all the same, Street Fighter Alpha 3 for the PS is one of my all time favorite games, so if my PS3 ever does bite the dust I don't know what I'll do.

EDIT: I called every future shop/wal mart/best buy/visions ect ect. in the city when I tried to purchase the Xbone and there was zero availability if that means anything. 




 TIL the PS4 is way better than the Xbone. 




 I had the same problem with the xbone, so I ordered it from future shop's website with free shipping. Showed up at my door in 1.5 days VIA Canada post. Not sure if it would be similar for the PS4, but it's worth a shot. 




 Ahh yeah, you're right, it totally is a mirror. Very similar to the [inspection mirror](http://imgur.com/tiaPDfj.jpg) I use at work. 




 Excess string spooled up? 




 I had the same thing with the DVD, waited about a week and a bit, then got the shipment confirmation email the other day. So they will replenish their stock. 









 I love this thing striss, great work!

EDIT: Can we secure an area while we're working on it? Probably put a timer on there so if one forgets it'll automatically reset and be available to the public once again. I was drawing a flag, came back in an hour and someone had it messed up, now I'm pouting and don't want to continue. 




 Although his/her answer was thorough and awesome, s/he did allude to Calgary being more of a white collar town, which is really not the case. Maybe on the surface it would appear that way, but there are many trades for one to get into. Even with only a high school diploma, you could definitely get your foot in the door as a pipe fitter and make a great living in a few years. Do you know people in either town or surrounding areas? That would be the biggest deciding factor for me. 




 Good old Sook Yin, I used to have a huge crush on her growing up. I seriously miss the 90's MuchMusic format, back when the programming actually covered music, and music related subjects. Yes, we live in a different era and they have to pander to what sells, I'm just disappointed. Please don't link me to the MTV guy ranting to people like me.

I thought she did a decent job with the interview, maybe a tad nervous, but that probably comes from being a big fan. I thought Maynard handled the tool related questions just fine, he more or less finger pointed towards the other guys at the end there, but that's nothing new.

EDIT: [She's still looking cute as ever](http://m.imdb.com/name/nm0498271/) 




 [http://vimeo.com/m/6262622](http://vimeo.com/m/6262622) 




 I had a small click of friends that slowly expanded throughout high school, some of my expansion pack friends were more popular and went to parties with people who I generally didn't associate with (jocks and preps I believe were the terms we used back then). I recall going to one of these parties (somewhere around 1998), where the booze kicked in and I had the balls to stop the music that was currently playing, whatever it was I remember it being terrible. Either way I remember dropping on aenima that I had brought (I never left the house without 15-20 cd's and a discman in my backpack). I was expecting contorted faces of disgust and hatred, however stinkfist kicked in and everyone seemed to mesh to it, and it was awesome. Then I thought to myself, ok, this will all change when Die Eier Von Satan comes on. Waited patiently for that industrial German racket to begin with my troll face in gear. Again, a room full of people from all clicks just had the best time, it was the first time I think I realized that maybe it was me who was the asshole and not everyone else. It's like I shed a layer of hatred that night.

I have no idea why I just replied to your message with this.

EDIT: Grammar/additional info. 




 I have to agree with you. This video was on the front page yesterday after all. I'd say it's probably OP. 




 Hey thanks a lot, I'll look into it. My only concern is waiting right now, I like the idea of not having to order from amazon. But it's good to have options. Thanks again for the info. 




 Can you make any recommendations? 




 I'm looking to upgrade my desktop computer sound system, was wondering if any of you fine people have any experience with the [Harman Kardon Soundsticks III](http://www.memoryexpress.com/Products/MX44014)? 




 Thank you kind internet person. 




 Thank you very much! 









 I've never seen it. I guess I should check it out?

EDIT: "You" = "I". 




 Thanks. I also love the song "Rosie" by Tom Waits, and then of course there's Interpol and their song "Evil". I thought to myself, this name is mentioned way too many times in songs I love. 




 Thank you. 




 I am a little bit of a collector, however I don't mind sampling most things from the internet, but when it comes to music I feel the urge to physically own it. Maybe I'll take your advice until I can find a copy! 




 I hadn't taken part in this poll, but am very surprised to see "Rosemary" so high up in the rankings. I also love this song, and have talked to my wife and we have agreed to use "Rosemary" as the name for my daughter to be. Glad people love it as much as I do. 




 Will do thanks. I ended up ordering it off amazon but they were out of stock so I have to wait for them to get more. In the meantime I'll try music stores around the city. 




 It was definitely worth it. Also, the live DVD is amazing. 









 Is there anywhere else to purchase this item other than [puscifer.com](http://www.puscifer.com)? The $30 shipping charge is astronomical, and I haven't found another place to buy it yet. Any info would be awesome, thanks. 




 I just had one at [Oasis](http://www.experienceoasis.ca/index.php) yesterday, they do fine work. No membership required. 




 Awesome. 




 Haha I am not surprised. 
























 Purdy. 




 I've never took the time to sit down and watch this in its entirety. I'll definitely do that next chance I have, thanks. What's the best version? 









 Link? 




 Very nice, thanks. I'll check it out. 




 Link?

 [This was his reaction](http://i.imgur.com/05PowmR.png) 









 Ok thank you very much. 




 bah 




 I'll have a look around I guess. Thanks. 




 Oh sweet Jesus. Willing to sell it? 




 Since there seems to be an almost zero chance of finding the original pressing of Aenima on vinyl, would any of you lucky owners be willing to rip and share yours? I've heard so many good things about the recording, and it being my favorite album of all time, I'm dying to hear it. Not sure if it would be near the same quality, but I'm willing to try anything at this point.

EDIT: I should go on *record* here and say that I am not a fan of "pirating" music, and that I buy all the music I enjoy listening to, that this plea is nothing but a desperate man trying to fulfill his curiosity. I'd love nothing more than to take a trip back to 1996 this weekend and buy my own copy for a price that wouldn't take food from my children's mouths. 




 Might I recommend the novels "The Exorcost", and "Legion". 




 No worries. 




 That was my point. If I found the fog creepy, I would have to be agoraphobic(homichlophobic?). 




 Where I'm from, the fog is so thick you can lean on it. 














 I have no idea, sorry about that. 




 Hey, it was worth a shot. I'm glad you enjoyed them at least. If I can think of anything else I'll let you know. Take care. 




 Hotdogs, maggots, whiskey. Blend, serve out of a bowl. 




 Awesome, glad to hear that. Let me know what you think. 




 I listen to all sorts of music, mostly metal. Of course I don't like to play dreary stuff around my son who is just hitting the 20 month mark here, so my other acquired tastes have come in handy. Not that they have a positive message per se, but it's all about being instrumental, upbeat, and light (electronica is good for this). The little guy loves to dance and bob his head around. Anyways, try a few of these maybe.

 From my basic understanding, they prevent the natural downward airflow from leaving the tips of the wings, essentially causing the aircraft to weigh less in flight. Again, this is my very basic knowledge, actually might be a good question for /r/ELI5. 




 Memory express. There are several in the city. 




 Please see above coversation.  




 There's always maintenance. 




 I did an Aircraft Structural Repair course through a Transport Canada approved school, I then applied all across the country to find a position. Once my foot was in the door I gained more and more experience until I completed the required task list in a logbook, then I wrote an exam to acquire my AME 'S' license. Everything I do involves reading and understanding engineering approved repairs and OEM drawings. Engineers do not over see the project at hand, but are there as support if there is a deviation from drawing spec. As a licensed tech I would never put my name to anything that wasn't to drawing spec, or deviated without engineering approval.  




 Yeah, I know. I guess for those who never booked a flight online maybe? That sentence looks as ridiculous as it felt writing it. 




 NOT having them would be cost, HAVING them would be fuel efficiency. All depends on the customers requirements, much as if you were buying a new car, is paying a little extra for a hybrid something that's important to you. I guess with the winglets they double as good means of advertisement. 




 [http://i.imgur.com/7Xp7PVG.png](http://i.imgur.com/7Xp7PVG.png) 




 All hi-loks and bolts. 




 Without getting into too much detail, we would remove and replace the upper and lower outboard wing panels, beef up the outboard wing ribs, and add reinforcements to the wing stringers both in the wings and the centre tanks. Of course last but not least, hang the winglets.

EDIT: Eventually the 737's came from the factory with all the added rework complete, so that if a customer wanted to hang winglets, all they had to do was purchase and hang them up.

EDIT: Stringers not stingers. 




 No worries. It took so long because of all the structural reinforcement we did. 




 It's been a few years but if I remember correctly I think we had it down to something like 6 crews of 4 working around the clock for 4 days. That's not including the day of preparation by the mechanics.

EDIT: I just wanted to point out that my "glad to see they're still holding up" statement was meant to be light hearted, and of course it would be unsettling if they began to fail. However I absolutely wouldn't second guess anything we ever did, it was always done right. Westjet are all I ever fly. 




 That was a really fun job actually. Had a great crew to work with.

 Yeah I'm a fan of my tattoo artists work. [Here's another one he did for me](http://i.imgur.com/sL1ak.jpg).

 One of the many awesome lines in that song. 




 I've already submitted this image to this sub before but [here it is again](http://i.imgur.com/tXvZxkL.jpg).

I've since added on to it and plan on turning my entire upper arm into a half sleeve. It's apparent what my favorite album is, Come On Up to the he House is probably my all time favourite track by Tom. 




 Yeah, what do you have to lose? I subscribed to /r/bandporn a while ago and I rarely see activity here. I am disappointed.  




 That's why I said "particular".

 Hey thanks. 




 I've read the manual, and I do what it says, 16KM a month. That's the bare minimum it gets engaged during the summer months, it gets used much more during the winter. Haven't tried tapping anything with a hammer because it was under warranty therefore diagnosed and fixed with no cost to me. Thanks for your help though. 




 I know hey? What an awesome guy.

 I'm going to try introducing his sister to him, and then do what was suggested and bring him out for an ice cream. Then again, our little muffin might be asleep when he gets here so I'll keep this in mind. Thanks! 




 Thanks for this. I will keep this in mind. I have the next two weeks off so I will be sure to spend some extra father son time. 




 Awesome idea, I will do this. 




 Yeah he's not quite there yet. 




 Thank you! This was our initial idea, I think we will just go with it.  




 My wife brought our beautiful little baby girl into the world last night. We are very happy and proud. We also have a 19 month old son who has been staying with my wife's sister since she went into labour. We are home now and everyone is happy and healthy, however our son is still at aunties and is going to return tomorrow morning. My wife and I are nervous and curious about how we are supposed to introduce our son to our new edition. Should I hold her, or should mommy? I know it won't be the smoothest transition ever, but whatever we can do to make it easier on everyone will help. Thanks in advance reddit! 




 No shit hey? Such baloney. 




 So I've heard. 




 This is one persons point of view based on nothing more than conjecture. I don't think all three bands are some kind of twisted inside joke on the fans. More like people doing what they do best and making a living. Could the situation get anymore dissected? Talk about "over thinking and over analyzing". 




 Please take my opinion lightly, but I've read your post and all the comments in it. It seems to me most of you are taking it all way too seriously, who gives a fuck? You're not going to change how other people perceive or feel about it, so why even bother. I'm with you on the matter but it's pointless to bring it up. Some people like things in a way that you don't, good lord better point it out, that'll teach them. Singling out the downfalls of others is pretty sophomoric in itself, why not make a post expressing your "insight" in a more constructive way? Why not tell us how Tool's music has affected you, changed you, or got you through a hard time, effectively removing the spot light from the "idols"? As for the comment here literally over analyzing the shit out of the whole thing, I've never read a more desperate attempt at trying to have Maynard personally login and and agree. Jesus H Christ people, it's music, of course the contributing artists will get credit equal to the greatness of the art. It's the exact same reason why many humans throughout history have become house hold names. 




 Absolutely. 




 Thank you very much for that. It's good to know this issue isn't directly attributed to me haha. I guess I'll cross that bridge if it happens again, I'm sure there are instructions online for this kind of thing. Thanks again. 




 As of this past weekend I have found out that my 4x4 actuator has failed, and my truck would not disengage from H4. I did some quick googling and found that this may be a common problem on newer Toyota models, however I wanted to know if any of you had experience with this issue. My truck is still covered by warranty so for now I will be spared the financial and labor burdens. However, if this is common I would like to know more about what it does exactly, and how I could prevent it from happening again (if possible) and/or fix it myself. 

Thanks in advance for your time.

 The blue was a good call, looks good dude. 




 Who are the other two dudes in this pic besides Patrick and Reznor? 




 My friend told me it was going to be Steve Austin and Steve Irwin. I said that couldn't be possible, but then again they brought Tupac back for lollapalooza.

 So I found this:

[http://www.ebay.com/itm/Tool-Aenima-vinyl-record-2-discs-BMG-Zoo-1996-/131142218994](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Tool-Aenima-vinyl-record-2-discs-BMG-Zoo-1996-/131142218994)

The guy writes:

*"UPC code is 6 1422-31087-1 1 There's another number on the back: 72445-11087-1"*

Does that make sense? Because it doesn't seem to. It would appear to be two different pressings. 




 Thank you. 




 How does one ensure they aren't getting hosed when attempting to buy a legitimate copy of this? 




 I have a baby due the day after so I may not make it,  I'll get over it though. 




 Well, that about sums it up I guess. It's a total shit show, and I'm still blown away, but this is the world we live in. 




 I'm thinking out loud here and this statement should be taken with a grain of salt, but if this is the case then it's time for me to find new forms of inspiration. 




 Heck I'd take the fire lane. 




 Agree 100%. 




 Well I've been looking for an excuse to hit the road and visit the states, as a new dad I don't get much time to do things like that. With my wife on board for a guys road trip I figured seeing Soundgarden and NIN together would have been a fantastic opportunity.  




 Wow dude, first concert ever was NIN. Your jaw must have hit the floor. 




 Yeah, you're probably right. It makes sense now that you mention it. I was really looking forward to an epic road trip but oh well I guess, first world problems. Enjoy the show man, the Tension bluray will have to tide me over whenever it's released. 




 Yeah I get it, but I don't, if you can pick up what I'm laying down. I'm surprised Trent hasn't voiced an opinion about this yet. 




 I personally don't mind flipping $100.00 on a big production act, I know it isn't cheap to haul all of their gear around, not to mention the show itself is totally worth it, but this has been taken to a new level of expensive.

Again, I could probably land some $100.00 tickets during the public sale, but nothing short of the first 30 rows would make my 35 hours of driving worth it.

I'm with you on the underground, Animals As Leaders are playing downtown here for 25 dollars, can't get much better than that. 




 For those of you wanting to know:

* I took the picture with my phone because I wanted to quickly send it to my cousin and didn't want to go through the process on my phone.

* These are the "platinum" seats for Red Rocks using the "MYWAVE" Soundgarden fan club code.

* It is my personal opinion that no one is worth this much and that these are obviously reserved for the rich. (Unless of course there was some kind of meet and greet and/or sound check attendance which even then I wouldn't flip the bill)

* I can't see Trent agreeing to this after all he's stood up and said regarding corporations with hands in his pockets. What the actual fuck is going on here?

 









 I had the exact same issue, although captcha seemed to fuck me over as well. No matter how many times I plugged in the captcha correctly, it would not let me through. I was planning a huge road trip from Calgary for this show, fuck. 




 This is my favourite aircraft on the planet. Thanks for these, haven't seen them before. 




 Very nice. I have quite a few framed and matted myself. I've yet to post my collection. At least I don't think I have haha. 




 Are you still farming negs in /r/toolband? I gotta give it to you, that's pretty dedicated. 




 Damn, didn't even see that. 




 Newfoundland beaches look nothing like that. Then again, neither do the Newfoundlanders. I'm going to go with my gut on this one and say it's fake. 




 Go to Michael's, get a decent frame, and a color matching matte. That's your best and cheapest method for preserving its awesomeness. Otherwise, you could go full on custom, it'll cost quite a bit more but look pretty rad. This is assuming of course this wave of posters are again, not of standard size. I'm glad to hear there is no damage to it, way too nice for thumbtacks. 




 Dear God, is that thing tacked to the wall? 




 Turns out the F29345-3 anchor nut is a good alternative. Thanks for your help. 




 No dice, but this document will definitely come in handy in the future. Thanks for that. 




 My issue is I don't know the part number, and to the best of my knowledge I'm not sure if they even exist. Basically I'm looking for a corner (mickey mouse) style domed anchor nut, similar to the NAS1473A3. So I was hoping to find a comprehensive list breaking down all the different part numbers.  




 I've searched for a while now with no luck. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm looking mostly for NAS anchor nut specs. 




 As a naive 13 year old at the time, you may be right. 




 Thank you. 




 Well [here is the ghost](http://www.chatphiles.com/) of said website. It looks exactly the same, just inoperable. 




 Haha it's all good. You wouldn't be talking about mIRC by any chance are you?

Chatphiles was dedicated to X-Files, you ranked up through an FBI like ranking system with frequent use. I can't remember the room names, but they were all X-Files related. It's been so long I'm trying to figure out what happened to the site. 




 Nice, thanks. 




 I'm a structures guy, so I'm hoping that same applies if need be. I have also been in the inspection department for 4ish years. 




 Yes sir, that's where that plane was headed. 




 Hey man I am just a simple inspector but I'm glad Viking was there to help out. 




 That would be the place! 




 Radiohead have nothing on Tool's perfectionism/procrastination. This is my attempt at humor and not to be taken seriously. I love both bands very much, but Tool hasn't released anything since 2006 and it's bit of a touchy subject over in /r/toolband, so much so I don't even comment about it.  
























 Thank you very much. How have I not seen this before, so awesome. 




 Hey can you link me to that amazing wallpaper? 




 What's that from? 




 Left. 




 Nope. 




 No open? 




 It's not the actual live track, just the album version dubbed over some footage. 




 Alcoholism if I remember correctly. 




 Two drips two pounds 




 Looks unofficial. I once bought a similar tool documentary back when I was naive and border line mentally retarded, and it was the worst shit ever. 









 Apparently it's a little old lady who doesn't mind at all, I was also told she has 24 hour surveillance. 

I got to wondering if she acquired the house after the show ended? Or if she owned it the entire time and have to vacate during filming? 









 It's a nice place. 




 Thanks! I'll try and come up with something. 




 Yeah I can't part with one if my opiates but I have lots of Internet high fives.

What do the dimensions have to be? 




 Few things in my basement, quickly snapped these with a fresh russet (sorry).

EDIT: I love how my contribution which is directly pertinent to the post topic was downvoted. Sigh.  




 Seconded.  




 Bleh 




 Let's send the mods flowers and see if they respond. 




 I would welcome any change my friend. 




 Was it a limited addition bottle? 









 I swear to the cosmos I was just about to edit my comment to clarify this. 




 This would actually be the most relevant theme actually. Good idea.

EDIT: [http://imgur.com/a/Ea2Qd](http://imgur.com/a/Ea2Qd) 




 What a fucking hilarious comment, Jesus Christ I almost woke my kids up. 




 He did that here in Calgary too. Pretty sure it's common. 




 I get why Alex Grey's net of being is posted up above, but I'd love to see a change. Maybe something more classic. Is there anyway I can initiate change other than submitting a bitchy self post? It would be awesome to see something from Undertow or Aenima up there.

 Sorry I do not have any. 




 Dear god that looks amazing. I've only ever lurked in this sub before, this has been the first thing to make me come out of the shadows. I definitely want to give this a try. Thank you. 




 I'm positive they would have to. 




 Thanks, I keep forgetting about that.

 Hahahaha 




 Can you imgur pictures of the items? 




 Big fan of Village Wit.  




 Looking for a good hutch/dresser stand for our living room. Have anything that fits the description? If so what are the dimensions? Thanks! 




 That's because us fliers are simply cash cows, so fuck us.

It suits Jesse's relapse so well AND she's the only woman on the planet who would make me consider leaving my wife (whom I'm happily married to). 




 Alright alright, point taken. 




 I am just tossing out the idea, I haven't heard anything myself. It would be awesome though.

EDIT: I for one am really excited to relive some Halo 3 action. Hoping this is accurate. 




 Well I wouldn't go as far as physical, we've only made out a couple of times. 




 I can't help tit. 




 Sorry, I am a dumb. 




 That was the joke. A play on the saying "Where's your God now?"
 




 I knew I couldn't be the only one of us. 









 Very cool. Thanks. 




 Thank you! 




 WHERE'S YOUR COD NOW? 




 Sorry if this is a dumb question but I'm way out of the loop on what's going on, does this mean there will be re-mastered version of each multiplayer? Or only H2, and re-mastered campaigns of the other games? I currently have 2 babies in diapers and a job that demands 190% of my effort in life so my attention to gaming has dropped, again my apologies. 




  So, in 2020?

My inside sources are telling me 2024. 




 Yeah me too. 




 mark my words...

I'll try and remember to come back to this on album release day. 




 Thank you. 




 I've been going through the comment section of this thread here and I think the guy you wrote about is downvoting everything you write. You wrote "Thank you" and got downvoted, what the hell. 




 [http://i.imgur.com/7Tzkhim.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/7Tzkhim.jpg) 




 Absolutely, I do cherish every moment at this stage. I just can't help but feel like a terrible parent every time I break away and I hear his screams with "daaaaaaad" echoing over the stairs, through the door way, or out the window. 




 I needed to hear this, thanks. 




 My oldest son is almost 22 months, and for the past little while I cannot leave his presence (use the washroom, make/take a phone call, run errands etc etc.) without him throwing an absolute nightmarish tantrum. Up until now I've more or less shrugged it off, but I've got to thinking that *maybe* it's some form of separation anxiety. Now I'm wondering if this is normal and maybe just a phase kids go through. Just wondering if any of you have advice. Thanks! 




 Yes. 




 [This is what came to my mind.](http://youtu.be/8yiqGtZXCmQ) 




 "*I'm a reasonable man, get off my case.*"

 Good work, love this.

 Yeah, it was my sarcastic attempt at getting the message across. Maybe in hindsight I could have used a better approach, but what is done is done now, and I'll go down with the ship. Not every post comes off as it's intended, such is text based communication. 




 I'd like to say Glass Casket are somewhat similar. Dustie and Blake play for them. 




 Haha, I've been there. It's funny to be a dick, even if no one else thinks so. 




 Yeah I hear ya. I think most people operate like that. It's a faceless world we live in. I try to keep it on the level both on the Internet and in real life, but sometimes I too feel like calling people out on their bullshit. 




 Look at the position of the picture I linked up above, unless the passenger reached over and took a picture from the drivers perspective I don't know how else to explain it. 

That was the point of my title, to get a rise. However unlike you, I don't need a separate troll account for the occasional troll. 




 Will do thanks. Can you help me understand why you think taking pictures on the highway is ok? Or why you think the person behind the wheel of a motorized vehicle should be doing ANYTHING other than paying attention to the road. Apparently common courtesy is too much to ask from you young bucks with nothing to lose.  

EDIT: I just went through your comment history, it's pretty obvious this is your troll account. I think I'll stop here haha. 




 Orly? Please tell us more. Your juvenile use of the English language tells me you're well versed on the topic. 




 [http://i.imgur.com/z0EqqdD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/z0EqqdD.jpg) 




 To feed the trolls or not, I always find the decision difficult. 









 I approve of this message. 




 Good thing you whipped out your cell phone for a quick picture. Nothing like sacrificing your life and the lives around you for several imaginary internet points. 









 Met girl.
Moved in.
Got married.
Bought house.
Bought truck.
Had two children. 




 Agreed. Nice tat. 




 That is awesome. I've always wanted to get this inked but could never come up with a nice design. I may have to draw inspiration from this if that's ok haha. 




 [http://i.imgur.com/yV4kXEC.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/yV4kXEC.jpg)

I'd be willing to throw in a month of gold for the best submission if that helps. Also, since this is for my work SFW would be best. Thanks in advance. 




 Whole heartedly agree with this statement. 




 Yes. The ocular orifice. Check my "edit" haha. 




 Aenima.

Edit: [Very much Aenima](http://i.imgur.com/sL1ak.jpg) 




 Haha. 




 Probably due to the over all gloomy disposition of its sound. My son is only 21 months old and we listen to "what does the fox say" 20 times a day. 




 At his age let him explore the music himself. Right now he's probably best off taking it at face value and listening solely to the music anyways. As adults here we can appreciate the fact this song is about mourning a loved one, a mother at that, hence why I thought it was appropriate for the day.  




 It's just one of those "appreciate what you have while you have it" deal.  




 I'm in Calgary, we have horrible winters here too. So many days I've been dealing with what seems like this exact scenario. 




 I saw them last year, my friend being a huge fan wanted to go so I went along. I walked out with a feeling of "meh" while he was vibrating with excitement. Different strokes for different folks I suppose. I definitely respect them, but their art just doesn't speak to me.

 I've never put much thought into Edmonton as to actually form an opinion, but now I'm convinced, Edmonton is a shit hole and I hate it. 




 Thought this could be useful here.

 I have seen that, but can't remember anything about it at all. That sounds hilarious though, good times. 




 Perhaps. 




 "Rock band 'Tool' from Los Angeles, California busted in an LSD distribution operation. Will they find out the true meaning of Prison Sex? Stay tuned as the story unfolds tonight at 11." 




 No I'm good thanks. 




 No, it's definitely part of the packaging. I'm going to go with everyone else in this thread and say it's a representation of LSD. 




 That. Is. Hilarious.  




 Ok, get back to you in a bit.

EDIT: Nothing happened. 




 See I thought that, but wasn't sure. 




 I may get burned at the stake for this, but [Dlek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A4lek) as an opening act was so unexpected and original I was blown away. Especially when they broke out the laptops to help out on lateralus, it was amazing. 




 [This is when I saw Isis open](http://www.imgur.com/EXN0blO) 









 Oh my God I just busted out laughing like a fucking idiot in front of 10 people. 




 I seriously would not sleep in the same building as that thing. 









 I picture a Ned Flanders type just blindly throwing hay makers into a crowd. 




 Love this comment and your user name. We should be friends. 




 Ah I see, sorry for reacting like a dick haha. Kudos. 




 It's an x-post, so yeah, thanks though.

 What do you mean by go through them? The only option I can see is rearrange or delete.

EDIT: [This guy explains it pretty well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBMyP27ACpQ) 




 I truly believe this to be a complex question as I cannot find a solid answer elsewhere on the teh internet.
