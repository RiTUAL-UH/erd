 I'm editing a multi-camera live concert video that was shot with a bunch of DSLRs and a BMCC. The BMCC has vastly superior image quality, but as the night goes on, it seems to have developed a dozen or more hot pixels that show up as white or coloured dots and are quite noticeable on a black background.

Any ideas on how to make them less noticeable? Thanks in advance guys! 









































































































































































 So we've been using sennheiser in ear monitors for the last 12 months or so, with the stock earbuds, and recently I had a chance to use the same radio pack and microphones with a set of shure earbuds. I didn't see what model they were, but they absolutely blew me away, the sound was just crystal. Full and clear. 

So as I hunt around for earbud options, I thought I'd consult the pros here - have you guys found nirvana in a stage earphone? What should I check out?

 




 An update to the thread I posted last week...

So today my band and I taped our Starking appearance. We sang with Girl's Day - at least, three of them, Minah must have known I'm dangerous and stayed away.

I never realized just how young those girls are - but they were totally charming, super professional and heaps of fun. Then we did a couple of songs with Brown Eyed Girls, who came across as... Sort of grumpy.

I don't know how our singing went, but we had an awesome time with the new hosts, Boom and Teuk (ex super junior) and it was a pretty damn hilarious day all up, once all the waiting around was out of the way. They seemed to think we kicked some butt, so who knows, it could lead us somewhere. :)

it's going to air in late November, I'll get a copy when I can and stick it on YouTube - but yeah, I thought you guys would appreciate what a crazy day I just had! :D 









 I sing with an Australian a cappella group, we're in Korea quite regularly, this will be our third visit this year. One of the things we love to incorporate in our show is bad imitations of k-pop songs, it's pretty funny since we're all guys.

Long story short, some TV producers saw us singing Twinkle Twinkle earlier this year and they've invited us to do a broadcast later this week.... And it seems like they're bringing Girl's Day in for the show as well. I have no idea what's going to happen, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be hilarious. :)

Wish us luck! 





































































 I've got a nice frontpage setup, but I like to see what's going on in the rest of the reddit world as well. Seeing as there's a few specific subreddits that are super popular but totally not of interest to me, is there any way to filter them out? 




 I've manually created a vignette effect (I know, I know) that I want to use on a dozen or so clips. I'm just dipping my toe into after effects, is it easy to save that adjustment layer and copy it across to the other clips, or am I missing the point? :) 




 I'm starting to shout at my telly now, having just come through the Vice section. The evidence is so weak and the questions so vague at this point of the game that you're more or less just guessing in interrogations. Even when you get questions right, you seem to get bugger-all in return. And it doesn't matter if you stuff every question up, the game goes on. It's like a movie in which you twiddle a thumbstick every now and then to get to the next scene.

The action is pretty ordinary and formulaic, the driving is both boring and unnecessary, the city has little in it that makes me want to explore further, the main character is a bit of a prat... Sure, the stories are great and the character animations fantastic - but the gameplay is so fucking irritating that I'd probably be happier if I left it alone and never finished it.

Next to Red Dead Redemption, this feels like a gimmicky vehicle for the awesome animation work of Team Bondi, a half way step towards future games that might put the technology to better use. But that might just be me. 














 I want to expand my abilities... Can you guys throw out some quick tips on how to make a project more visually interesting with the footage you've got? If you can point to any example videos I'd love to see them.  




 Sorry guys, beginner's question here: I'm working on a 25fps sequence using footage from 2 cameras - a Sony HDV camera and a Canon 7D. We've shot interviews and the like from 2 angles and want to be able to cut back and forth between vision from the two cameras - but it seems they shoot in slightly different frame rates.

If I create a 25fps sequence and just drop in the 23.975fps footage, does Premiere CS5 just sort frame rate issues out? Or do I need to process it somewhere else? Oh, and sorry if this is a stupid question! 









 Hey guys - just a quickie. I've been using prores transcoding in FCP, which does a great job of making 7D footage editable. Now I have to do a reasonably large project in CS5 - should I edit the 7D footage straight, or transcode it to something?

If I need to transcode it, can I do it using the Apple Compressor, or does Adobe have its own tool that works better? What format works best?

Cheers in advance! 














 Hey guys - thanks for the inspiration. I'm on day 2 of keto plus a few weeks into Starting Strength; I'm gonna be a total posterboy for reddit body transformation... heh heh. 

I'm struggling already though... The thought of greasy food for dinner again is making me a bit nauseous, plus I feel headachy and drained. Just checking in to make sure this is normal... Is it? 
























 Hi guys - and thanks for giving me the inspiration to get back to training after more than 10 years on my arse.

I went in and did my first squats, deads and press workout today, and ended up in a conversation with the guy running the place. I've got bad knees as a result of way too much basketball when I was younger, and I'm now carrying a lot of weight (~125kg) - getting my legs back in shape to support dodgy knees is the main reason SS appealed to me. I've been doing bodyweight broomstick squats at home for the last month or so.

The gym guy, an old fella who seems experienced in free weight training, is telling me I shouldn't jump straight into 5-rep heavy lifting in search of strength. That since I haven't been in a gym for 10 years I should spend at least a month doing low weights for 20-30 reps on things like leg extensions, unweighted or low weight bar squats and the like, in order to prepare my tendons and ligaments for the stress, that if not, I'm risking a blowout at the squat rack with severe consequences.

This seems to go against what Rippetoe says in SS - that the squat is not only the perfect conditioner of connective tissue, but that done properly, it shouldn't be dangerous. The way I read it, he seems to be saying learn the right forms and get straight into it. I'm confused... Help! 












































 So we're replacing a band member, and have found one strong candidate who seems to have a lot of the attributes we need - a rare combination. But his groove is non-existant - too much time in the classical world I think.

I've got time to spend with him if we decide he's our man, but I wonder what you guys' experiences are. Is groove innate or can it be trained? Will I be pushing shit uphill if I try to train him? And how would you go about it? Mixtapes? Metronomes? One-on-one sessions? 

Any ideas? 




















































































 Thought I'd bring this one up because it always tends to flush out a bunch of other wonderfully horrific stories about how other dudes lost THEIR knackers. 

SO:

I was lucky, because my nut started to hurt. In most cases, testicular cancer is absolutely painless, which lets it grow and spread to the lymph nodes, lungs and eventually the brain (which is the state it got to before Lance Armstrong did anything about it).

In my case, it was caught early because I'm a rabid motorcyclist and was learning to pull wheelies. When you're learning wheelies, you tend to smack the bike down and bash yourself in the nads a lot. The best guess of the docs is that weeks of testicular trauma due to mousetrapped wheelies had caused a minor bleed into a tumour that was growing in ol' righty. The bleed caused it to swell until the nut was twice its normal size, it hurt like a thousand bastards and I got it diagnosed. So it could be said that wheelies may have saved my life. Honestly, officer.

Apparently most cases of testicular cancer are discovered by the missus, in the bath. Or so I'm told.

The rest of the process was fairly simple. They chop out the diseased bollock (though it's not a simple case of cut the ol' scrotum and pull it out, they actually go in from your stomach, below your navel and off to the side, go figure), you go stash some wigglies at the sperm bank and then go for a short round of chemotherapy, which has a 50% chance of permanently sterilising you.

Chemo sucks, in my case it was just one IV bag of one chemical, carboplatin, which is so toxic that the nurse carries it in wearing elbow-length gloves. A nice touch. The treatment took 45 minutes, after which I had to go sing a gig. That was interesting. It left me with no appetite or energy for weeks, and for the next 3-4 years I felt kind of foggy in the head, as if I was thinking through cotton wool. I can only imagine things are worse for people who have to go through longer treatments - Armstrong is a good example, he had to have five or six, the poor bugger. With just one treatment, I didn't even lose any hair.

Anyway, I didn't find the process overly scary, and apart from the annoying effects of chemo, I can honestly say that one nut works just as well as two (the missus tested it out just hours after surgery). Looks a bit odd, mind you, but then the frank 'n' beans have never struck me as particularly pleasing to look at, even in the best of times.

So hopefully if there's anyone out there that's just copped a nasty shock, found a lump or had a diagnosis, I can reassure you a bit. There's plenty of blog posts, articles and whatnot on the net where fellas make a big deal out of losing one ball, what it means to their manhood, and generally make it sound very scary. It doesn't have to be, though, and your life will go on just fine. The guy at [www.mybollox.com](www.mybollox.com) has a pretty healthy attitude about it all (and incidentally, the same doctor as I had).

As for the rest of you, if this post gets you to fondle your nuts or the nuts of somebody you care about, I'd consider that a win for everyone. Even if you don't find anything.

Fire away! 







































 I'll be doing up a full review in time, perhaps a video review too - but since this is such a breakthrough bike, arguably one of the two most fascinating superbikes of 2010 alongside the S1000R, I thought you motoreddit folk might have some questions. So if you do, ask away! 


































 I know what you want to say, and I know you're struggling to get it out, and I know YOU know I know. What I don't know is whether it's ruder for me to finish the sentence for you so we can move on, or to wait for you to finish and let you hang out there because I don't want to talk over you... 

So, uh, whaddya reckon, should I finish your sentences? 

















































 He might come in very handy as an Oden remedy.  




 FUCK THESE FUCKING CUNTS
 




 11 in the morning here in Melbourne, Australia. Dunno what you're all complaining about. :P
 




 Heeheehee 




 Sure, but it was IMPLIED. 




 Highlights: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsvBg9UQXus

You know, looking back on it, there were some great dunks but the competition itself has always been a joke. Nique's two handed windmill with his head over the rim scores 45 and Jordan gets a 50 for the same dunk he did in the semi round? C'mooonnnn. As a kid this was a really huge thing, but looking at it now, I kind of understand why the name players wouldn't bother with it. 









 I'll give YOU two wet balls in a minute. 









 Vince, MJ and Dominique Wilkins were absolute highlight factories, but there's no argument in my mind that Carter is the best dunker that's ever played in the NBA. 




 'Knoaf mate 




 But you have the athletic trainer of the year up there!  




 I think this serves an important purpose.  




 Dummies would be spat. 




 Gold is a nice way of spreading a bit of joy while supporting the website. Best thing to do is to pay it forward... Here ya go! :P 




 http://assets.dogtime.com/asset/image/4f967276eadf725ead000500/column_dog-picture-photo-puppy-growl.jpg 




 I feel like the Hawks should take this one as a moral victory. Durant made a huge shot at the end, but it was immediately preceded by a bitch-ass push off no call and a rip-through. I reckon we should be able to expect more from KD.

I wanted OKC to win, but... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avr7enrZuJQ

Hawks' offense made a fool of the Thunder through the first 3 quarters, every basket seemed like an easy one, where the Thunder were struggling to get shots off and making some really tough looks. GG Hawks. 




 Blockrates?!? Hahaha!
 




 Plenty of post but it's also a great lens, I bet it's the 135 f/2 L.  




 I thought the same thing, but we did a cheap-arse wedding and it turned out to be one of the best days of my life.  




 For me, yeah. But that's because my camera only had one good autofocus point in the center there and I don't trust the others.  




 I think it might also help to use a fisheye lens or another ultra wide, then you can exaggerate the painted flowers and give the sense of being right behind the canvas instead of looking from a few feet away.  




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z201YXJX3c0 




 It's called a go360. Here's me being a dickhead reviewing one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z201YXJX3c0 




 Doesn't show a lot of class going off for 70 on one of the worst teams in history in a total blowout. Then again, there was bugger-all else interesting about that game. 




 I dunno. He's not real flash at making in-game adjustments, but he's astonishing in between playoff games at taking away an advantage. 




 Well woop de doo. 




 "War is bad. It makes me sad."

- Melo's sole contribution to his University history class. 




 DMC stood on Paul's foot as he was trying to turn and run. 




 Everybody just wants somebody to beat the fucking heat.  




 Slim reapist? 









 He missed that free throw just to fuck with you. 




 It just occurred to me to check what the record for consecutive 30-point games was... Yyyyyeah, Wilt with sixty-fuckin'-five. Dayumn. 




 Amazing figures, considering how shittily he started the 4th quarter.  




 To me it doesn't look like it's quite stopped rising. 




 Good games for their time, but I think the ship has sailed. 




 Really? I think he comes across as a thoughtful, warm, stand-up guy. 




 Then again, I've heard it said that if you get a hold of somebody's chinpiece you can 'make their head go wherever you want it to. ' 




 Aussie here - I never picked a team, I just like keeping an eye on the league as a whole and catching as many games as I can from the teams that are doing awesome stuff at any given time. 




 I think it's actually a positive, kinda like Pop making sure the Heat don't get a look at the full squad before crunch time. 




 Since the Heat beat OKC in the finals, they always seem to be in the Thunder's heads. Maybe this is the year they turn that #2 self-perception on its head. 




 Also not to mention he scored a career high on Iguodala, one of the best wing defenders in the game. 




 On the other hand, as well as KD is playing, the OKC offense has long periods of total suckage. No movement, no plan, just give it to the Reaper and hope he can do something cool. I wouldn't be surprised if the Spurs take it comfortably, even if Kawhi ends up with a KD scrotum-print on his eye sockets. 




 That's not language. Get with the times! 




 What about making video players marginally less stupid so they can play the video vertically?  




 His hook shots have been money lately. 




 I think you're right, he's got one of the biggest verticals I've ever seen and he has a lot of style and flair. Although Blake and DeAndre occasionally unleash those giant destructo-dunks that are even more exciting. What Blake did to Pau, foul or not, was two of the best dunks I ever saw. 




 Ah righto. 




 Because LeBron denies that he's slacking off, maybe he's just running low on energy. 




 Why would he be angry at Deng? It's not like he had a say in the matter.  




 I like your new adjective there. PG got all dunkier-than-thou on the Clips. 




 Heh heh yeah been there - missus not impressed. But that only happens once or twice, after that the adage holds! 




 Looks like a decent rider stuffing around to me. No such thing as an unintentional wheelie. 




 Pacers forgot how to miss... 




 This should be a ripper game. I'm thinking pacers by 10 though. 




 But who the fuck understands the theory behind a pop hit? It doesn't matter. 




 Kids can emotionally connect with music without intellectually understanding it. Try that with your Dostoyevski.  




 Funny that so many cartoons use classical soundtracks. How can we expect kids to understand that?  




 Whaaaaaat? 




 ...scrogged.  




 It looks a bit... Fallen off of. I think you've just munted your resale value - and let's face it, this is a learner bike, you're gonna want to sell it within a couple of years. 




 Awwwwww! That's sweet! 




 YO MOMMA ATE THEM
 




 No way - no two guys move the same way in the air. Look at MJ's dunk contest efforts, there was nothing formulaic about those yet they just looked so damn good in slo-mo. 




 No way, he was saying in the lead-up to the contest that he had 4 dunks prepared that nobody had ever seen before. It wasn't improvised. 




 Nature's *other* dental floss. 




 It was always dogmatix here in Australia when I was a kid.  




 'Tis a bag of wank, sir! 'Tis not for riding. 




 Well you sure told them. 




 Nothing out of the ordinary. 




 Man, I LOVE the countryside, I spend hours just jumping dirt bikes in the mountains. Go play GTAIV if you want to be stuck in a big, grotty city. 




 YOU'RE A CUNT. 

Oh, sorry, are we starting yet?  




 I read somewhere that the uncle had been involved in price collusion with the Chinese over some NK business deals too... 




 You start with the body - tall, lean, strong. Unbelievable athleticism, the league had never really seen anybody who could just hang in the air so long. Watch the old game tapes, Jordan would elevate for a shot, wait for the defenders to drop out of the air, then shoot right over the top, have a coffee and come down. His hands were gigantic too, he could palm the ball at will, giving him amazing control on the dribble, or in the air, or grabbing steals. And his speed was absolutely stunning, in the open court he had an extra gear that nobody could keep up with. 90% of the time he looked like a coiled spring, running conservatively, but then he'd explode and it was amazing to watch.

Then there was the offensive skills - his touch was absolutely ridiculous, nobody has ever come close. He'd make layups the league has still never seen again, changing his mind two or three times in the air and kissing it in with a little spin off the backboard. His post game was just unreal to watch, that turnaround fadeaway was so deadly. He was an absolutely electric scorer, if the ball was in MJ's hands something amazing could happen at any second. Excellent vision, too, finding teammates or punishing a sloppy double - and if he got a sniff of the rim, he'd rise up and posterize ANYBODY in his way.

You could talk about defense - that sprung from his ridiculous motor. The guy was just ON all the time, an absolute energy factory and there were rumours he'd party all night and turn up and still demolish you. He was a constant threat on defense, not just on his own man, but a demon in the passing lanes for steals and most games he'd have one or two out-of-nowhere flying blocks as well. 

The competitive spirit and iron will just burned in him, he was the ultimate win-at-all-costs psychopath, to the point where it almost looks like it's ruining his life after basketball. He took *everything* personally, in fact if there was the tiniest reason to get pissed off with somebody, he'd make it his mission to destroy and humiliate them, and more often than not, these were his best games. Having said that, he never took a game off. You see LeBron and the heat coasting during the regular season - that would never happen on a Bulls squad, they just had a fire inside. 72 wins in one regular season is evidence of that.

And on top of all this and his many other gifts, he was also the most stylish player ever to take the court. Everything he did just looked so damn beautiful and in control. He was loose and fluid, but incredibly strong and athletic at the same time. If you played ball in the 80s and 90s, you'd see so much of MJ's style in the other kids - tongues out, scoop reverse layups, jumpman leg splits, people just wanted to be him. It sure didn't hurt that his Nike PR team concealed what a knob he was from the public so impeccably. 

So yeah - perfect storm. Outstanding physical gifts, unparalleled drive to improve and win, smart, skilled, creative, unstoppable and more marketable than pretty much anything the world has seen since. 




 Ah, you never know. Some people respond to Kobe's glaring style of motivation, others would absolutely hate it. 




 Yeah good call. The old one had much nicer colour and contrast than my 24-105, but it was just useless indoors. Blew me away how blurry every shot was. 




 Canon 5D3 lets you do it in-camera, hence a rash of similar pictures when that camera launched.
 




 Canon 24-70 f/2.8 - I haven't tried the new one, but I had the old one for a year and hated it. Lack of IS really killed it in the low light situations I expected it to shine in. 




 Canon 135mm f/2L. 




 Perhaps the balls dropped? 




 There's a difference between really bad and just completely destroyed by injuries. Bad luck has played a big part, the team was performing above expectations before everyone got carted away in the meat wagon.

 




 He should be there for sure, he's an absolute highlight machine. 




 Plus, y'know, proximity of teeth to balls.  




 Wow. 

If you were a boy scout I'd hand you an advanced turd polishing badge. That is very impressive.  




 Right on, it's no kind of path to peace or happiness. After all, what's the ultimate goal? 




 Forget variable NDs, they're garbage. 




 He acts like a child throwing a tanty. 




 Jesus, what a loser. 




 What's this from? 




 Haha I wrote about this a couple years ago, they're fasscinating! Couple of amazing videos of them at work too: http://www.gizmag.com/nuclear-icebreakers-double-acting-ships-azipods/20903/ 




 I think it's more than that. I think the US relies on massive military spending for such a huge chunk of its economy that it's become addicted to war. The country has deliberately stayed in constant conflict since WW2. Drop that spending and the country would be thrown back into depression.  




 *shudder*

Dude think of it this way: a new chain and sprockets makes the motor and gearbox feel amazing. I change my chains a bit more often than is strictly necessary just 'coz I love the feel of a fresh set.  




 You. You are a bad person.  




 I agree on both those counts, but he also comes off as a total knob end. 




 Yeah, now that you mention it. Aussie here and I reckon Bogut looks like a proper bastard.  




 Not only the initial impact, but the two jagged ends of each bone snagging and pinching all the muscle and tendon as the foot dangles freely. Ugh.  




 "Whoooo, a little more choke and that would've started! " 




 "Better an empty flat than a bad tenant..." 




 I'm not sure that's a bad thing. Aussie drinking culture is pretty gross. Source: ex-piskarn.  




 Unwatchable. 




 It sure seems like every couple of days another great player goes down. Anybody keeping a list? Is there any way to compare this season to others in terms of which seasons have been most impacted by high profile player injuries? 

























































































 Ride one. Ride this one, then tell me how joyless it is! I was blown away. 




 Wait til ya ride one. I love me some dinosaur burners, but this was one of the most exciting things I've ridden in years. 









 Yeah but it's more like 'yes sweep til Brooklyn.' 




 Ctrl-F "stromile"

All is in order, thank you. 




 Haha bring it on! My brother and I did an hour long dick song show last year. It's a labour of love. Get her to link me done tunes! 




 Please show this to your daughter, I feel we may be kindred spirits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-QtWWZiQzo 




 Reporting for duty, where do I queue? 




 Green skinned Aussie here, can confirm.  




 Thunder would appear to have the edge, but dare I say DeAndre Jordan might be a big factor? Dude is acting like a 7 foot Rodman lately. 




 What they need is a coach who can better utilize Howard and Lin in a pick and roll offense. I hear D'Antoni is available. 




 Oh, I dunno, because he was playing like a sack of shit all series? 




 Not to mention, KD had been shooting like absolute faeces for the entire game, missing just about everything. 




 I gotta say it, Durant has looked like a piece of shit in this series.  




 That... That's actually pretty fantastic. 




 I choose not to be dragged down by the cynicism of this video. Instead I shall marvel at the gorgeous camerawork and sweet editing. 




 You smoke flavoured tobacco in those things for like 45 minutes at a time. I can't believe that wouldn't make a big difference to your energy levels in an overtime game. 




 /r/asmr ;) 




 I think it's more likely to go fungal, but we'll see! 




 Fair call. Unfortunately lyrics and melody are very tired together for me. Maybe this is just my dick period.  




 http://m.soundcloud.com/wrongtown-brothers/one-little-person ;) 




 I'm amazed I got the "honeymooner's choice" line past my editor in the Multistrada one... :P 




 Close - just north of Melbourne, Australia. 




 Not the missus, but one of her friends. I've banned the missus from getting on the back, she fell asleep in the twisties a couple of times and my ego couldn't take it. :P 




 She's fine. But yeah, I don't think she's real keen to get back on again. She had no idea when it happened, but when she saw the tape, she nearly crapped herself. 




 Cheers mate! We're going to get back into them in the next few months. :) 




 Aye, it looks tight as a motherfucker. Is that how the drag guys run them? 




 They made some absolutely shithouse chemistry moves when they dealt Granger and picked up Turner and Bynum. Heart and soul got replaced by a pair of me-first bastards. 




 Dwight and Lopez look weirdly uncoordinated on offense. Dwight's hook looks so stiff and strange.  




 *dominant 




 There's been a few similar threads on Reddit with people admitting they've got the attraction and are trying like hell never to act on it. What a tough hand to be dealt. 




 He also works his arse off, to be fair.  




 Ya mean white balance? 




 I feel like there's an equivalent Austin Powers gif just waiting to get made. 




 There were sure some amazing characters back then. Gods like Jordan, villains like Laimbeer, and a complete alien like Rodman the likes of which we won't see again.  




 Well, they still dribble up and down the court, so I'd like to see that included. 




 What a great video! 




 I dunno, he seems like a nice guy, but a total clown. A lot like Dwight Howard in that regard.  




 Wishful thinking I reckon. Consistency ain't his game.  




 Those things are pure horn in the metal. 




 That is some serious skill. Not a great bike for doing stoppies on, and he's just owning it! 




 Refurbished macbook pro?  









 Greatest that ever lived. 




 Durant looked very ordinary out there for most of that game. Almost seemed like he was pushing to get to his 25 points. 




 That's the problem here - the Spurs have a better chance of beating the Heat. Just let 'em through already. 




 I've taken pairs of tyres to the shop like that. Gotta plan ahead a bit in traffic! A mate then asked how to move a tyre I was giving him, and I told him to put his arms up and slip it over his head. Had him stuck like that for about 5 minutes while I rolled around laughing. Pro tip: stand in the tyre and pull it up around your waist! 




 As an Aussie, it's absolutely worthy of comment. Any sports stars over here that behaved like that would be treated with the kind of scorn Americans seem to reserve for Justin Bieber. 




 Metta's Champions thing was alright. Is he "active?"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjEUAtEisc4 




 Or are they just really missing Granger? 




 I'd agree with this. If you've got the time and skills to grade all your footage, then go ahead and shoot cinestyle. But it adds time to the process, and unless you know what you're doing, it actually makes the footage look worse than standard. I've gone back to shooting a lot of my stuff on standard because clients can't tell the difference and it's heaps quicker. 




 Well will ya look at that date! 




 It's the ring of faeeeeeceeeees... 




 I had a hornet 919 years ago, ripping bike, loved it. Might even prefer it to the FZS1000 at the end of the day! But ya gotta run what ya brung as they say!  




 Yep, the 2002. Need to keep it revving like mad to keep up with the big twins I'm chasing! Could do with some bottom end.  









 They absolutely fucked that piece of road up.  




 I dunno... Show me the data.  




 Barkley was an energy-filled hate machine of intimidation. He went hard as a motherfucker with full intensity on every play. 




 Bought it. Watched it. It's got a few moments but it's not awesome.  




 Dear god. 




 Can you say that five times fast?  




 My theory is that people see crystal clear photos and don't have the emotional response that they get from old photos. A lot of stylistic processing emulates the problems inherent in shit cameras, old film or old photos and that resonates with people's desire to reminisce. It gives the photos a kind of aged credibility. It's odd.  




 That's the "Chuck a Wheelie" signal.  




 WHOSE GAME IS IT? IT'S MICHAEL JORDAN'S GAME!  




 WITHOUT THE BASKETBAAAAALLLLL 




 Nigga on, if that's what gets you through the day. 




 Be... cause I didn't see that?  :P 









 Here, I knocked this up. Hope it helps!

 OK I'll put something together. 




 Honestly the bars and big eyes make it look a bit like a sad elephant. But I bet it's nicer to ride already.  




 Let's not forget, whichever porn star he chooses to rail will be made well aware that he's the slut shaming asshole that outed one of their colleagues. It will not go well for him.  




 YOU FOOL. YOU WILL KILL THIS SUBREDDIT WITH TALK LIKE THAT!  




 It's incredibly easy, super intuitive and extremely fast - even faster when you're dealing with a stack of shots. There's still things that PS is handy for, but LR absolutely shits on it for file handling, choosing your keepers, getting a basic look, doing your crops, etc etc etc. 




 And the league and the ticket buying public can't be sure one team or the other's just not going to bring half their squad. Pop reaps what he sows. 




 On my mobile right now but it's pretty intuitive. It's under lens corrections/color.  




 The primes give the best looking photos, but I can't get by without my 24-105. I probably take 90% of my shots with it. 




 It's a brilliant lens but pretty limited in scope. Probably makes my favourite images, but I'm not gonna take it out on a walk around! 




 Lightroom kills CA very effectively, you can spend a little tie and make absolutely sure you've got rid of it on your keepers. 




 Mine too. It flies.  




 Appreciated! (I think I've fucked it) :) 




 I've always thought he was a straight up knob. 




 Why's that?  




 Symptoms are as follows: Lens seems to work normally at 24mm, but as you zoom in, the IS and aperture start to jump around wildly. I believe this is an issue with the flexible communications ribbon that connects to the aperture control ring. Canon Australia wants $480 to repair it... That's ludicrous, especially given that you can get a whole new lens for $700 in some places.

I've found a second hand aperture ring with a new ribbon soldered on and I want to have a crack at making the repair, but I understand it's easy to knock certain lens elements out of alignment in the process. Has anyone opened one of these lenses up, and do you have any tips for me? 




 Old fixer upper motorcycle. 




 Mirror? 




 Anyone ever yells that at you, I got bad news for ya. Or good news, depending... 




 That was great! 




 What about "I'm... We're..." and "As if you'd ever take responsibility for something!"

 




 Penis. 




 Wow. :) 




 Sweet baby jesus that was good.  




 Nice shot... I assume you've got in and cropped it as straight as you can, and fiddled with the distortion controls? If so, you might need to fire this one into Photoshop and play with the skew or perspective tools. 




 You guys woulda held on if it wasn't for the okc defense though. That 12-0 run had a stack of forced turnovers in it.  




 Just chuck it in and go! FCPX is awesome with DSLR video.

 HGGGGNNNNNNNGGGGGHHHHH

*spaff*

Two, please. One with a flat bar. 




 A vow of positivity... I should look into that, I'm a grumpy cunt. 




 I'd go a step further and name him as the greatest single sportsman of the modern era. Better and more transcendent than Rossi, Federer, Schumacher, Tiger, Beckham... Maybe there's an argument for Wayne Gretzky, but ice hockey is a much less global sport than basketball.

Good god. 




 Funny how these things keep showing up around dunk contest time. 




 All this "I'm not doing the dunk contest, but look at me anyway" stuff is bullshit. Put up or shut up. 




 Yeah but it sort of fell flat. 




 I remember MJ saying something that really resonated with me - something along the lines that every night, there was some kid up in the stands who was only ever going to get one chance to see him play. He said he played every night for that kid, so he could never take a night off. 




 And yet look at who the heat lose to. 




 Similar to the way LeBron's regular season coasting will tarnish his legacy. 




 I can tell you I got the Canon 135 recently and it's an absolute ripper. Sharp, separates the background beautifully and focuses very fast. And half the price.  




 For sure, but if your auto focus system is losing you shots and getting you into trouble with clients... 




 Except... Most of those are deeply ordinary pictures, I see nothing that makes me want to give up my DSLR.  




 Yes, but he had that whole thing going where he sort of loped about at half pace, keeping up with everyone, and then exploded when he wanted to. Extraordinary motor. 




 Fucking hell, it feels like Stern had been on his last couple of days for about two years!  




 YEAH IT WAS ABOUT TIME SOMEBODY TOOK BENNETT DOWN A PEG. 




 It's a beast unless she shoots fast action stuff, in which case it's only awesome. 




 So much can happen though. KD could snap like a twig in a winning WCF game 7. You've got to be in it to win it, and the pathetic East more or less hands the ECF to Miami with only one decent team in the way.  
























 Dominique Wilkins. The guy had heart, and he dunked like he wanted to throw his whole body through the rim.  




 They're both in 'motor valley' about half an hour out of Bologna. Basically, if you're a petrolhead and you're in the region, it's a must-visit destination. Ducati, Moto Guzzi, Ferrari, Lamborghini etc etc... This is no big deal. 




 He does come off as a bit of a knob to the casual viewer.  




 There can be only one. 




 Len Bias? 




 Sure ain't going to be a team that places emphasis on character. The guy's a fool.  




 A black guy, clearly.

 At 12 mm on a full frame, you can almost see behind yourself. In the wedding shot I would have looked like I was right in their faces, no more than a couple feet away. It can be a really cool effect but it feels incredibly rude to shoot this way!

 Man, a Kurt Rambis basketball card was always the best shitty one to get in your pack. Those glasses... That moustache... I almost couldn't believe he was a real person.

http://d1warraxuf7xh1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/act_kurt_rambis.jpg 




 His sources were probably executives that were worried about the foot. He didn't report that the foot was fucked, he just said it was an issue with various executives. Both sides could be right on this one.  




 Yeah I kind of had it in my head that he was old, tired and flogged out. I guess not! 




 You'd have to include Oden then.  




 I've had the fuckers draw level with me at 80kmh.  




 Pessimistically confident.  




 It was probably all the #thereturn crap. Hold the guy up as basketball Jesus and there's bound to be a backlash. 




 Ahhhh shit, the poor bastard. His wave was just about to break. 




 Can't see that happening. Wade is part of the furniture.  




 Don't you have something better to do?  




 Motorcycle sales would rocket.  




 I dunno about that. Pop has said he's gonna retire the day Timmy does.  




 Small ball and the trap defense worked for a particular lineup of guys - Miami is rebuilding from scratch now, so I'd presume their style of play will change depending on who they sign. 




 Keep one of these under your seat: http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Safety-Car-Bike-Auto-Tubeless-Tire-Tyre-Puncture-Plug-Repair-Cement-Tool-Kit-/291047728863?_trksid=p2054897.l5660

You can also get miniature air compressors. I use them heaps - as often on my mates' bikes/cars as on my own. 




 Hornet 919 was one of the best all-round bikes I ever owned. I miss it heaps. It fit me like a glove and did everything - touring, stunting, track days, commuting, great for passengers, the lot. 

I haven't ridden the FZ09 yet - it's on the list - but you can pick those old Hornets up super cheap in my part of town and I'm forever looking at them in the paper and going "hmmmmm..."

The Speed Triple, if you can stretch for one of those, is the [best bike in the whole world ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDNrRX6EzWA). 




 I thought it was called a four-play.  




 Dude that was one of the all time greatest highlights I've ever seen. And it came right after another insane putback slam. I feel for Pau and all but those made me jump out of my seat.  




 Because if they're paid what they're worth, they'll lose again.  




 That was more or less me 15 years ago. Funny thing is, the muscle memory of all those thousands of hours hasn't gone away. I don't shoot hoops for years at a time but I can step right up and hit 8 for 10 free throws. 

Anyway, I feel for ya but there's a big wide world of other stuff out there. Motorcycles filled the gap for me.  




 Yeah they're tops! I'm just trying to arrange a test unit, the SMH10 and 10R turned me back on to riding with headsets. 




 On my high school team we had one guy who could dunk, and it was a big deal. 




 It was that or Drew Peacock. I just wanted a penis name.  




 He was an unstoppable offensive rebounder when MyPlayer Dick Harden got drafted to Dallas.  




 I dunno, surely it's a severe dose of short-man complex that makes him the ferocious competitor he is... 




 I kinda have a bad feeling about it. A kind of cancery feeling. The Bulls' success has been built on heart, effort and hard work. I'm not sure you can plug a me-first guy into that and not kill it.   




 At least she's not called La La. 




 Yup that's me. 1198 isn't the worst bike I've ridden around town - I've been riding the new Buell lately and that takes that dubious honor. But the s1000rr is as smooth as butter. If you want a bike that can be Clark Kent as well as superman, it's gotta be the Beemer. Doesn't look as nice but test ride both and the difference will be obvious.  




 Went up there with a car and a bike a few months ago. 3 nails in the bike rear tyre, one in the car tyre. What the hell is that all about?  




 The amount of seriously dicey u-turns I've done on windy roads durung tests... *shudder* 




 Fucken lot of work eh. I'm ashamed to say it but the farty noises in your oil change vid made me giggle like a school girl.  




 Lightning is about to release something that will shit on every bike on the road. Fastest production bike ever.  




 That team could be the most punchable collection of faces in history.  




 And bow legged. 




 The leftist party wasn't left enough for the southern States, plus they'd just made cunts of themselves. Abbott won by keeping his mouth shut. And he's probably still got loads of support, just not from people who can use the Internet.  




 Jordan has become a real heart and soul player in the last 2 years. I'd be very sad to see him go.  




 That's absolutely stunning footage for a 21 year old sports broadcast. Crystal clear... And so many cameras - they had just as many on the reverse side. Clearly knew they were filming a once in a lifetime athlete.  




 Certainly the best correction of athletes - not sure it really lived up to its potential though.  




 Bron needs his hand held and Wade needs to feel like he's still relevant?

Edit: I think it's more like Bron throwing Wade a bone. 




 PJ3 played some really good ball while Westbrook was out. Sad to see him ride the bench in the playoffs. 




 I've been lucky enough to ride a ton of bikes, and the best by a mile was the Speed Triple. No question.  




 DONGGGGGG 




 I had the chance to sit down with Randy Mamola once a few years ago and ask about this stuff. He told me that an engine part made for Rossi might cost 3 times as much as the one on Lorenzo's bike. There's a huge difference again between that and the satellite bikes.  




 Hard to beat Wade in hateability.  




 I want total humiliation.  




 They should let Bron do interviews without Wade there to hold his hand.  




 Condolences in your last two decades.  




 Bulls with Melo and Rose might be able to knock the heat off, especially if they bring the chump game we've seen the last two times out.  




 The Poo Game (tm)
 




 Plus, he takes an arse-kicking like a champ. 




 I think it's great. As often as not, it takes a special kind of psychopath to become rich enough to own an NBA team. Hang 'em high if they've been pricks. 




 No way - the Spurs first half offense has been blowing everyone away. Mind you, so has the Heat's shitty D. 




 That Heat uniform is the wrong colour to be shitting yourself in. 




 Then again, Melo might look at the way Bosh has gone from being the Man to playing third and fourth fiddle. 




 So much skill, such a finely tuned human being, erased in an instant after what was probably a tiny error. Vale Bob Price. 









 You and I could work as hard as we wanted and not end up with his size, strength or bounce. Even among NBA athletes, most of whom work like bastards, he's an outlier.

Edit: missed your point entirely, play on! 




 A lot of uncharacteristic turnovers. Much as I want Miami to lose, I don't think we'll see that kind of effort again. 




 Winning genetic lotteries? 




 All those chats are played through the in house PA. 




 I make a point of blurring the speedo in anything I put up anywhere. No need for John Q. Law to have any reason to come after you, no need for anyone who knows the road to be looking at what your corner speeds are - whether it's higher or lower than theirs, little good can come of it. 




 He's an ignoranus.  




 This can go back and forth all day. You've got your opinion, I've told you mine. Great player, bullshit situation and I don't have to be impressed by it.  




 Took his legacy in his hands by teaming up with two of his biggest competitors in the east and taking a pay cut to prevent the salary cap from maintaining competitive balance. Clearly it worked a treat, and plenty of people jump on board when you start winning.  




 I have plenty of respect for LeBron's game, but fuck the Miami superteam. It's a pussy's path to a ring.  




 If everybody you meet seems to be an arsehole, you're probably the arsehole.  




 Those dunks at the end... Lad's got some anger to get out.  




 Outlaw gangs are very real and very serious.  




 You know, it's kind of possible.  




 The leap to side-sitting on the tank at 2:15 made me laugh out loud in joy and disbelief. Beast! 




 So... What sound does a cockenballs make?  




 Garn then, show us!  




 Wow. I can't remember ever seeing somebody get thrown so high.  




 He's handling garbage most of the time.  




 "Cupcake?" 




 Me too! Excellent cheap hobby.  




 I've got some 5-driver Westone jobs. I use then for onstage in-ear monitors. Having said that, I think they're total overkill even for that. I reckon most any molded earpieces would do the job.  




 Lance Stephenson:

 Well he does seem like a bit of a cunt.

 Right with ya mate, not naked enough. 




 About the same as good noise cancellers.  




 I thought the sennheiser noise canceling cans were pretty good, until I started taking a set of molded earphones on the plane with me. They're tons better, you can listen to stuff on the lowest volume setting. Lets your brain relax.  




 Interesting point. I guess we'll see.  




 How much of that was flat top?  




 I don't think it's cool for you to broadcast that offer Glidecam extended you. 




 Agreed. It was so good, it made me like a Nickelback song.  




 Right - not to mention how deflating it is to your sense of self belief to take on the best team in the league without your #3 offensive option and best defender. OKC plays on emotion, this is a killer.

Also, fuck the heat. 




 Onya dad! :) 




 Won a stack of road races too, Angel Nieto rode Bultaco in the 70s. But more recently they've been known as off-road and trials 2-strokers. 




 ...but you've only got one arse to put on them! 




 Nothing about OKC's stagnant, iso-heavy offence convinced me they'd beat the spurs even when Ibaka was healthy. Ibaka is their most important defensive asset and their #3 option at the other end. They might get a win or two but I think they're finished, especially since the Spurs have a great defender to put on KD, and home court advantage to boot. 




 Top level racers are by no means normal people.  




 Regular season records don't count if your team is coasting like a bitch.  




 Agreed. Source: will never shut up about hating this chequebook superteam.  




 They were all pathetic. And he should die in a fire. 




 But it's basically totally comprised of wrinkles! 




 This is only true of some people's spit. But when you find someone with just the right loogies, you hang on with both hands.  
























 All depends on how far you can see.

 You wouldn't change gears there though would you? I mean, you ride first for a bit before hooking second.

 Yes sir! Well spotted. 




 Lake Mountain, VIC. Get into it!  




 That's stunning slow mo! I wanna know why the extra clutch grab once the bike was already up - that's odd. Watching what happens on the throttle side is pretty scary too.  




 Lucky man. Last time a chain snapped on me it whipped up, beheaded an indicator, chainsawed the ducktail and made a bit of a mess inside the sprocket cover. I had a passenger on too, thank christ the chain guard did its job.  




 Heh heh can't be too careful eh! Anyway, I'm the guy in front on the grandpa bike.

 What about those of us who think it plays directly into the hands of the enemy? It's what these pricks have been begging for all along. 




 If you go out trying to be a dick to people, and people say "you're being a dick" you shouldn't act all surprised. OP baited christians and reeled one in, of course he's being disrespectful. That was the point all along.  




 My point is whoever made the sticker knew they were being disrespectful, as did the person that stuck it on their car. There's no reason to have it if you're not baiting.  




 These days, just something some christians stick on their cars.  




 Why would you get that sticker if you weren't being disrespectful? It's a Jesus fish with a different god in it.  It's designed to be disrespectful.  




 It was a beautiful reminder of our mortality and how fleeting youth and beauty can be. I watched it on the shitter and shed a tear while wiping my butt. That was an odd experience.  




 Indeed. Could have cut down on the wank factor.  




 99% invisible steps into those areas occasionally and is otherwise pretty beaut.  




 That and it made my penis go numb.  




 Hahaha indeed! 




 No point in doing reviews if you can't find a way to have a whinge. That's why I've gotta stop doing superbikes, what the hell can your average mug like me say about those things?   









 Told me? I was official scorekeeper! 




 My brother managed 10 times in 2 hours the first time he tried ecstasy.  




 Tough luck pac-man. You're eating the brown pills today.  




 It's a joke that reveals what you think about the situation.  




 You are blaming the victim, that's exactly what you're doing. Heaps of people take naked pictures of themselves, for whatever reason, and that's their business, and if they fuck up and put it in the wrong place that's their fault. If somebody steals them from a place they believe is secure, that's another entirely. They probably had no idea that their stuff was going to the cloud. It's all automatic.  




 They're a really nice little bike. Engine from the days when you didn't have to rev the piss out of them. Would make a good stunter. Have fun!

 Good for quick cheap prototyping and full color models. The results can be hardened to a pretty solid form by soaking in some sort of glue. Stuff that isn't post treated in this way can start flaking in the finicky bits. But yeah, very cheap as they use regular 80gsm paper.  




 Wow, I never realised he was no jive-talkin' wigger. 




 Holy shit, different suspension for front and rear? Where do I sign? 




 Cleveland: the new Heatles. I was ready to get behind LeBron, but superteams are just icky. 




 As a motorcyclist, it's extraordinary just how much you can feel the difference when you get right up the bum of a truck. I've used it as a technique to squeeze the last few miles out of a low fuel warning, you need almost no power once you're in the draft.

Having said that, I've been playing with an adaptive cruise system lately in a test car, and that seems significantly less fuel efficient than the way I'd drive if I was operating the pedals. It slows down and speeds up quite aggressively to maintain the distance you choose from the car in front. I'd guess that early self driving cars, before they begin talking to one another, will be less energy efficient than fuel-conscious human drivers. 




 The fountain of youth... I think that's what happens when we try to change his nappy. 









 I dunno where in the world you are, but it's generally about as much as a Panigale.  




 The EBR possibly steers and handles a touch quicker, it's very enjoyable in corners. The BMW has a more flexible and more powerful engine, but it's a total computer bike and something like 33% of them have reliability issues, is what I'm reading. They've all got their individual character that will speak to different riders.  




 But... But I wasn't! I was saying it's a better all-rounder!  




 End of the day, Erik wants to be in that top 3, and he wants to race at the highest level.  




 The SX is basically exactly the same bike with the plastics off. Same gearing, same power, same torque and yep, same clutch. Better start working your forearm muscles!  




 Well cheers mate. I did a vid on your bike too, couple years back: Ducati Multistrada 1200 S Review: http://youtu.be/zyZ64Ef-yaY 




 On the bike, it's a Sena 20S headset (SMH10 would be almost as good and cheaper), through a GP10 backpack thingy for the GoPro. Wind noise is cancelled to virtually zero, and the audio is synced straight up with the vision. You can also record intercom conversations if you're out with multiple riders.

It's a great motovlogging setup, being able to talk on the bike means I don't have to shoot nearly as much footage off the bike as I used to - so I'm less reliant on having a cameraman around!

More info: http://www.gizmag.com/sena-20s-video-review/33093/ 




 Haha bush mechanics FTW! 




 That's fine in theory - but I'd say looks play a big part in the majority of bike buying decisions, like it or not! 









 Cheers! I'm gonna get a sleep study done in the next couple weeks. Thanks for the feedback.
 




 Hey there - I'm sleeping like shit and starting to investigate the idea of a CPAP machine too. What do you reckon? Worth a go? Did they make you feel more rested in the mornings? 




 I'd get more distortion at 12 mm. I reckon this is a 16 mm.  




 I think you need to put him on the level of guys like Valentino Rossi and Michel Schumacher - who not only dominated their sports, they transcended them to the point where the whole world started to take notice. 




 Fair go, he led the league in a pretty significant stat category this year, as well as leading the league in dunks. I think there's a discussion to be had.  




 Looks a bit like Michael Jackson.  




 Me too - bear with me here, I might be completely off track, but imagine the ball is your bodyweight. You come down hard on the shoe. The old shoes dissipate that force and don't bounce you back up. The new shoes seem to return most of that downward force back upwards.

How is that a good thing? 




 A ball would bounce much higher on concrete than on a trampoline.  




 ...wouldn't that throw more landing shock back up through the knee? 




 How many people burned their jerseys though? 20 would seem like a high number to me.

Fair enough.   




 Passionate and talented writers, photographers and filmmakers are exactly the people they should be giving prime access to. This is great publicity for everyone. He's demonstrated his ability, both to create strong content and to get it seen. He should get a press pass to whatever he wants now.  




 It's a 7 footer's move, and a really hard one. Big guys get it super easy all the way into the NBA. You'd need a very rare package of size, coordination, skill and dedication to develop that shot.  




 You just drill riders into your stock triples, you don't need to get a whole new jigger!
 




 KTM motorcycles all use WP suspension - stands for White Power but I think they're fairly keen to move on from that. :) 




 Aye, and a flat bar too.

 Nope. But go nuts if you're worried. You'll start out pretty slow - remember you're watching some super skilled riders in these clips. You're a god damned champion if you start hitting those kinds of lean angles.  




 I often go out to an empty carpark at night and run slow circles and figure 8s with a buddy or two. It's fucking hard work but you come away feeling like a god.  




 I dunno, he looked pretty fuckin' buggered when he hit the bench!  




 Scary motherfucker.  




 Wade shits me no end, and this play is part of the reason. Gets the great dunk, then goes out of his way to turn around and step over the guy to try to create a Pippen/Iverson moment. Wanker.  




 Best bike in the whole world ever.  




 A mate stacked my bike years ago, and it had ball-marks in the tank too. I just can't think of what else could cause it...  




 Degrees cost a lot of money. All well and good to get good marks, but some people are in it to learn stuff and challenge themselves!  




 God, he looked stiff as a board to me. It looked like everything hurt.  




 Ugh. Got his money's worth, I guess...

 The one dunk I ever got in a basketball game. I should add, it was a D-grade women's game and I was refereeing at the time. 

I'd spent several hours a day between the ages of 17 and 20 obsessed with trying to dunk. But as a 5'11 white guy the odds were stacked against me. Still, when the stars aligned I could get up there, I just couldn't quite palm the ball to get it down. A volleyball? No worries. A netball? I was throwing those down like Dr. J. Basketballs just eluded me. 

So there I am, bored out of my mind reffing this game, and one of the girls lumbers out on a "fast" break. I'm jogging behind her, the layup goes up, time slows down and my pupils dilate. 

I saw the sit - the ball was going to teeter on the front of the rim. I could just feel it. And instinct kicked in. I wasn't going to miss my chance. 

I took three quick steps and launched, grabbed the ball, and slammed it down with all my strength, shouting like a caveman. I landed triumphantly, threw my head back and hollered. 

And then I saw the confused faces of the players, blew my whistle and gave somebody a sideball.
