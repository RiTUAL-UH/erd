 What exactly happens ?  




 Either that or Britain's most pressing crisis is an epidemic of loss of eyesight. Or an inability to count. 




 Yes, it can indeed be addictive. It has its uses from my experience. 




 Well perhaps. The problem is that *all* economic forecasts from the IMF or otherwise have a very high error rate. 




 Hi. I'd just like to thank you for the previous reference (Kliman) that you sent me in response to a post 4 days ago on r/socialism concerning an article about the 'neighbourhood effects' of low wages. I haven't had time to read it all yet, but a brief scan makes me sceptical about their idea. It contradicts too much of the economic data available. In any case I will read it sometime soon even though I am sceptical. I'm not afraid of contrary views. What I appreciate is your efforts to actually present a substantive argument. That can be quite rare on the internet.

Take care,

Burt 




 Yes indeed. It does bring up a memory of a book I read a long time ago. Its title was 'How to Lie With Statistics'. 




 Which part ? It covers a lot of ground. 




 This post seems to have generated a bit of discussion, and I have expressed my opinion about its value below. All that I can add is that despite all the deficiencies pointed out, basically because of the purposes of the business unions and the fact it doesn't result in some huge and immediate eruption of working class self-organization, it is still something very valuable, praiseworthy and worth participating in. Massive changes in consciousness and organization don't happen suddenly. They are *always* prepared by a slow gradual back and forth of working for changes that may seem miniscule from a purist perspective. There is no other way. Yes, it is something to cheer. I'll give an analogy.

It's a football game, and you team has just made a 30 yard punt return. Do you grumble that it should have been 50, 60 yards or a TD ? Do you loudly complain about the intelligence of the quarterback or the running speed of the punt returner. Yes, the coach may be an asshole and incompetent to boot. The team manager may be dipping into the treasury, and the QB may be taking bribes to throw games. All of these problems *can't* be solved immediately with any amount of denunciation. Remember, it's still *your* team, and 30 yards is still worth cheering about. 




 Some of these are really creative. I wonder who the artists were. There are tags on some but not all. 




 No, I don't think there is any English translation yet. The book was only released 3 days ago in Paris. Interestingly enough I can't even find the name of the French publisher. I wouldn't be surprised if they were keeping that secret for obvious reasons. So I can't even tell you how to order the French version. A French magazine 'L'Obs' has published excerpts in the last few days - in French of course. 




 They'd probably find a way to have a monopoly on them.  




 The article was published in 2008 in 'Applied Animal Behavior Science' **113** 150-165. This journal is moving towards an open access policy, but at the time it wasn't so. It's there but behind a paywall I'm afraid. 




 I guess it depends on what year you take as a baseline. I think the report refers to the baseline as the last year. 




 Yes, I see what you mean.  




 I couldn't find the ad when I looked again, but that's not unexpected. The Daily Kos makes its money via ad revenue rather than subscriptions, and the ads 'rotate'. When I looked I could check out some sort of high end jacket, remove my brown spots, become beautiful again and have my criminal record erased and so on and so on and so on. Given the political views of the Daily Kos I wouldn't be amazed for them to run a Clinton ad. There are probably some politicians that they'd balk at, but those wouldn't try to advertise there anyways (except maybe Rand Paul).

No doubt Clinton has a whole necropolis of skeletons in her closet - besides being a crook - and some of the Democratic Party persuasion might be fully aware of that. A lot of people, however, are loyalists of one party or another under the 'lesser evil' mantra. It's not my view, but it is an arguable point of view. 




 More than 2,000 actually. He lived in the same 'axial age' that produced western philosophers such as Socrates, Plato and Aristotle and the Buddha in India. 




 My urban experience has been very much with racoons and deer. While I was growing up in the country I would occasionally spot wolves from a distance. I had 'close up' experience later in life when I nursed the loser in a wolf fight back to health. The first time in both the wolf and I were *very* cautious. Two months later he would jump for joy on seeing me. I used to bring people in to watch (behind two sets of bars) while I would raise his lips and 'twang' his fangs.

You know I've never been able to spot a mountain lion either in the country or in the city where they occasionally wander in. I've even been unrealistic enough to try and track them. To say the least this didn't go far. Bears sometimes wander into other cities, but I have a neurosis about them. No attempts to track them even though it's easier. As for the birds I'm not a great observer, but there are city falcons where I live, and I sometimes see them. Never saw them catching anything however. Eagles *very* occasionally and never in the city.

Another story. I hate crows and love squirrels. I once watched as a crow swooped down and grabbed one of the squirrels I feed. Up into the air, very, very high and then...'drop'. Splat ! I used to run into racoons a lot, but a couple of years ago the city police went around shooting them all in the neighbourhood. They have still to repopulate. The racoons never gave me any problems even though I would sometimes mistake them for a 'very big cat' in the dark. Never went "kitty, kitty, kitty" and tried to touch them. All my fingers are still attached.

Sorry to load old stories on you. It brings back memories. 




 Actually I'm not a great fan either. There were much more attractive ancient Chinese philosophers. Still, it was a quip rather than a statement of belief. Viva Lao Tzu. 




 I can appreciate your scepticism, but to be all Chinese about it, "they laughed at Confucius too". 




 Probably so, and coupon clip to the end of their days. Never, however, underestimate the allure of greed and lust for power. These can override even the most obvious calculations of self-interest. 




 You are right about that when I think of it. The item I posted was, of course, gung ho on the concept and ignored the complications. 




 In the end, however, the 'smaller state' rhetoric of various sorts of conservatism rarely becomes reality when they gain power. The role of government and its expenditures continue to expand. It's just that cons spend the money on their own pet projects. 




 You're welcome. 




 Yes I see that. I was totally unaware of Lewy's work. He is **not** the demographer described in the UCLA press release. That man's name is 'Patrick Heuveline'. Lewy is mentioned in the Wikipedia article I cited, and, interestingly enough, he was the writer who produced the *lowest* estimate of deaths from American action in Southeast Asia as is referred to above. That seems to fit with the description of his work given above. The Armenian genocide did of course happen as did that of the Roma whatever the man may say. I presume that Turkish government money had a lot to do with his opinions in the Armenian case. 




 Yes, it is indeed partially a PR campaign, but the nature of what the SEIU and others have chosen for their campaign is such that it has obvious benefits from any success it may gain. Also, don't forget that it is bringing in new people who have enthusiasm that hasn't been dampened by decades of 'business as usual'. This is a great field that shouldn't be ignored. 




 Yes probably true, but examine the numbers given in paragraph 2 above. Once more take the highest number and subtract that from the lowest estimate for Cambodian deaths. It still leaves 90% of the corpses as the responsibility of the Kymer Rouge. 




 You're correct. I got my references scrambled. The 1.5 to 3.6 million is from 1954 to 1975. The 1965 date is from a book by Guenter Lewy where he makes an estimate of the deaths in the Indochinese wars of 1,313,000. There are other references in the Wikipedia article to the Indochinese wars and estimates of the deaths in Cambodia by US action. 




 I don't believe he has investigated that case. Others, however, have done so. There is a [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_war_casualties) that presents the various estimates of the *total casualties* of the wars in Southeast Asia. The references are all there if you care to look at the matter more fully. Most of them are internet accessible. The total human cost of the wars were estimated to be from 1.5 to 3.6 million from 1965 when the US first got involved after the defeat of France. This figure includes all military deaths on both 'sides' as well as civilian deaths in Vietnam North and South, Laos and Cambodia. It doesn't include the genocide committed by the Kymer Rouge.

As with *all* estimates of the toll of genocides the figures can only be approximate and the numbers vary. In any case the numbers killed by US bombing in Cambodia prior to the KR takeover range from 40,000 to 150,000. This is horrendous enough, but taking the *highest* estimate of direct US responsibility and comparing it to the *lowest* estimate of KR murders it is *at best* 1/10th of what the KR did to the Cambodian people.

The *total* loss of human life in American wars in Southeast Asia, including both military and civilian deaths, is in the same ballpark as that of the KR murders. In Cambodia itself it was very much smaller.

Here's an interesting side note about the leftist politics of the time. The left in developed countries generally made 'heroic efforts' to avoid saying the truth about the fact that the USA along with China gave at least diplomatic support to the KR (and perhaps more especially in the case of China) during the time of the genocide. It would really spoil the narrative. The exceptions were Moscow line communists and some anarchists. 

It really threw the 'left' into a fit when their previous heroes, the Vietnamese communists, invaded Kampuchia after what were insufferable provocations in my opinion including the slaughter of ethnic Vietnamese in Kampuchia. It was Vietnam that ended the genocide.

If you wish to blame the USA for anything blame it for being a mouthpiece of the KR regime at the United Nations. Isn't international politics wonderful ? 




 As to the original question it seems to me to be chicken and egg. Does reddit make you depressed or do people go to reddit *because* they are depressed. My observations tell me that 'anger' is a lot bigger problem than depression in terms of having a sensible exchange of views. 

I do a lot of posting on subs devoted to scientific matters, and the general level of aggression there is several quantum leaps below what you'll find on 'political' sites. No doubt people can get angry at anything, but the political sites have a vastly greater amount of sewage in them. 




 "Plumbing" ??? This definitely suggests something about (bull)shit. I wonder if the execs were fully cynically aware while making the decision. 




 Thanks. 




 Thanks. I'm a subscriber to Science so I can access them. The paper edition hasn't arrived yet. Like most Science articles, however, non-members of the AAAS have no access. Too bad. Open access is becoming more and more common, and hopefully it will someday be the norm. 




 Myself I'm not too sure. No doubt the manned missions are often undertaken more from reasons of national prestige rather than scientific value. I still, however, think they have made substantial contributions - the ISS at least if not the Moon missions. The ISS has also build a groundwork for the international cooperation that can help in other missions.

So, I partly agree with you but only partly. 




 It has been repeatedly demonstrated, there is no connection between vaccination and autism (overdiagnosed in my opinion). People search for news that fits their preconceptions. yes, your comparison is quite apt.  




 Thank you very much for your work. I had a quick look at the paper, and to my mind it is indeed well done. Some of the math is beyond me. I know what a 'Fourier transform' is for instance but damned if I could offer an intelligent opinion on its use. In any case I found what I was looking for. The authors use the 'Pearson correlation coefficient' to look at the correlation between their gravitational mass data from lensing and the actual location of galaxies. Fair enough. I know of the test, but I don't know about its limitations.

Still, like I said, this answers a lot of my questions and reservations.

Just as a side note I've looked at the ArXiv before and I often find myself blocked from complete access. Is it truly open access, and am I missing something in my computer skills ? 




 Yes, I guess that is sadly true. There are a lot of problems with regulatory agencies, and the problems aren't confined to the USA. 




 You know I had a look at the map, and from a brief glance it does show such a correlation. My problem is that such a qualitative measure (my eyes) doesn't fully convince me. I tried to get at the original paper to see the 'curve fitting' used, but the dreaded paywall fell down on me. I assume the authors did due diligence on this matter. 




 The full context of the gender wage gap is discussed in the article ie all the various causes. It is also discussed in numerous other items both academic and official. The sudden knee jerk of a *flood* of angry comments to an article like this suggests a few things as does their persistence. This is obviously a thing that has high emotional content to some redditers, an emotional content that the general population doesn't share.

Terms such as 'gender wage gap', 'gender pay gap' etc are the common terms used in *all* legitimate economic publications. Perhaps they "rant" as well. 

As to your claims I see very well how the minds of some work. They (including you) are annoyed and in fact threatened by a presentation of a fact that contradicts their emotional anger/fear. They can hardly deny the facts so they resort to picking out something in the report that happens to be in *all* the educated reports on the matter. In this case it is the multifactorial nature of the *real* and properly named 'gender pay gap'. They think they've made a 'discovery' that allows them to launch an attack. After the attack they will forget about the nuanced nature of the item in question and retreat back to the "there is no gender pay gap" incantation that is so emotionally satisfying.

Fine and good. You can't look at a subject in a rational, dispassionate, **adult** manner. You do know, of course, that people like you have a mirror image 'evil twin' that acts exactly the same except that they switch the angel/demon labels. If you wish to find the "militant feminists" who are "bashing men" you can wander over to a wealth of the SRS reddits where people act like you do except that they have different enemies in a childish 'wargame'.

Your charge of being 'disingenuous' would have to be levied against *all* the economic studies of this matter, things that I read but you don't. Your magical phrase for preventing thought and self justification only works in your mind as the actual literature shows -over and over and over and over.

In any case this conversation is now closed. I had a quick look at your posting history (you are welcome to look at mine), and it seems it doesn't take much to send you into a fury. Please go to the SRS subs and yell at them. You are the 'enemy' they need just as they are the enemy you need.

 International call for solidarity with the case of Nicols Neira




In order to describe heaven, it is not necessary to transport up there earthy materials. It is necessary to abandon earth, its materials, in order to embellish life with its ideal Isidore Ducasse.

 With anger in our hearts and a deep sense of injustice is that we remember Nicols David Neira lvarez, a 15 year old young man, whose early affinity with anarchist ideas led him to be bludgeoned by the Colombian riot police (ESMAD) to the point that the constant banging of his head against the pavement damaged his brain matter. This happened during the heavy handed repression against the anarchist block during the May Day demonstrations in Bogot, 2005. He would pass away on the 6 of March.

 10 years later, we do not want to be viewed as victims, we do not forget and we shall not forgive. Today we face the same repression; peace-talk is no good when femicides are a regular staple, peace communities are persecuted, trans-gendered people are assassinated, when displaced people die hungry in the cold of the street, when death-squads threaten and attack mercilessly any expression of dissent, just as they did before. When military trucks are overloaded with youngsters from all over the country, taken away to uncertain destinations, and when our comrades in jail linger in overcrowded dungeons that the system calls prisons.

 10 years later we are happy to state that we are members of an international community, which has not been segmented by the borders, by flags, not even by language. We have been one with Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, Iberia, the United States, Ecuador, Venezuela, Indonesia, Palestine, Kurdistan, Greece, Turkey, Italy, Australia, Byelorussia, Egypt, Mexico. Every time we have shown our solidarity, discussing in the open or privately problems of places that may be far away in the map but not from the heart, every time we have acted accordingly to our desire to destroy to rebuild, when we have supported not facts, but for ideas harbouring the passions of millions of people; for those brief moments, as brief as life itself is brief, we have been able to be the entire world, the entire galaxy.

 For all this we want to invite you all, wherever you are, to carry any action which you think is suited to honour solidarity with Nico on this 6 of May. We know that you have anger and a deep sense of injustice as well, so we will be very happy to know of different activities, where the yell of Long live Nico! is heard of in different languages, and in different accents.

 Here's the beginning of such a list made up of 'mainstream' news sources from outside the USA. I'll begin with ones that I am fairly familiar with and give a separate list of suggestions for ones I know less about later. The symbol '(E)' after an item means that the source has an online English language section. Most but not all do. Be aware that most of these sources have a two tier system, one free and one paid. Let's start in the Middle East. Begin in the middle ?

[Al Jazeera](http://www.aljazeera.com) (E) Fairly well known left leaning service originally in Arabic. Best mainstream source for news from the Islamic world but also quite valuable in other areas.

[Le Monde](http://www.lemonde.fr) Most reputable paper in France. (E)nglish language edition available only by paid subscription. Centrist to moderate leftist outlook.

[AFP](http://www.afp.com) (E) French public news wire. Political views often very dependent on party in power.

[Agencia EFE](http://www.efe.com) (E) Largest Spanish language news service in Spain. Centrist to moderate right.

[El Pais](http://elpais.com) (E) Most popular newspaper in Spain. Conservative to moderate leftist.

[Telesur](http://telesurtv.net) (E) Spanish language service from Latin America. Centrist to leftist. Main value is in stories overlooked in English language media.

[BBC](http://www.bbc.com) (E) The grandmother of international news. British service spanning povs from conservative to leftist. World coverage makes it a very valuable source.

[The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com) (E) Left leaning, often quite visibly so, British newspaper. The grandmother of leftist sources in the anglosphere. 

[The Economist](http://theeconomist.com) (E) 'Intelligent conservative' or 'liberal' (in a non-American sense) business magazine with extensive coverage of non-economic matters as well. High quality and not ideologically rigid.

[Granma International](http://www.granma.cu) (E) Official Cuban government newswire. Very rigid ideologically but occasionally useful for matters ignored in the American media.

[CBC](www.cbc.ca) (E) Canadian public broadcaster. Moderate conservative to social democratic pov. Much higher quality than usual American sources.

[The Globe and Mail](http://theglobeandmail.com) (E) . Canadian 'national newspaper. Moderate conservative to leftist pov. 

[Xinhua](http://www.xinhuanet.com) (E) Official Chinese state news service. Often surprising for content you wouldn't expect from official sources.

[Global Times](http://www.globaltimes.cn) (E) Officially 'approved' news from China. Once more often surprising in content. Less ideologically rigid than Xinhua.

That's about it for sources that I am familiar with. Next installment will be other suggested mass media sources that I am less familiar with. Following that will be anarchist and leftist sources. 




 Of course it has to do with a pun on 'leftism'. It was right in the title as in 'off topic'. A pun for sure, not a knee slapping, gut bursting rolling on the floor howler of a joke. You know that explaining any joke kills the joke altogether. Now that you've killed the poor bugger I expect you to clean the mess off the floor. 

Not every post can be of world shaking importance or deep profundity.  




 The United States Census where the 78% number comes from are not really concerned about the 'interest' of 'most men' because they know that *most men and women will not have an emotional reaction to their findings*. *Most* meaning well over 90%. Please write letters of complaint to the US Census, the US Department of Commerce, and  the International Labor Organization (who put the US gap at 64%) and tell them how they should abandon economics in favor of somebody's emotions. The wage gap is an obvious and totally well established fact of economics. You may try to explain it away, but you shouldn't try to deny its reality. 




 Yes, unions have fought hard over the course of decades for 'equal pay for work of equal value', and progress certainly has been made. There is, however, evidence that even 'at the top' that women make less. The gap is narrower the higher you go. In my opinion the great majority of efforts should be concentrated at the lower end of the wage scale. The 78% figure is from the US Census. UN Human Development reports put it at 82% in the USA and 84% worldwide ie the USA is behind the world in terms of pay equity. The ILO, on the other hand, puts the gap at an astounding 64%. The reason for the difference is that the ILO includes part time workers while the Census only measures those with full time employment. The USA is dramatically behind the rest of the world in terms of pay equity for part time workers. 




 Glad to meet you. I have recently started a new subreddit r/worldanarchism which will hopefully be devoted to *international* ie non_American anarchist news. Please feel free to post anything you might feel relevant at that site. It would be appreciated. 




 I see you know a lot more about this forum than I do. I wasn't aware that it was *routinely* patrolled by a mass of very angry, very resentful people who have come to place their own personal problems, bad divorce or whatever, onto an abstraction called 'feminism'. It's actually quite sad.

The last time I went through references about the magnitude of the wage gap I think it was either the World Bank or the IMF figures that I found most convincing. I gave a short list of national and international agencies that measure the supposedly imaginary gap in a reply to another post.

The information is all there for people to look at. The trouble is that some people just won't look at it at all. Reality is less important than their need to assign blame. They certainly have a hell of a lot more emotion at stake than I do, and they escalate to anger very easily. Too bad. 




 Ahem !!! The 78% figure quoted is from the US Census. The estimate vary. The UN Development programme narrows the gap to 82% (US figures, the US lags behind the global average of 84%. On the other hand the International Labor Organization puts the gap at 64%. I'm sure the US Census would appreciate hearing from you on how wrong they are. It could be a matter of national importance. 




 Actually not at all. I remembered that there are other indexes compiled annually such as the Human Development Index. So I went to look. In the United Nations Development Programme website there is the Gender Inequality Index under the Human Development Reports. See http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/table-4-gender-inequality-index . The UN's table is **exactly** the sort of thing I was speculating about. It leaves out some the factors I mentioned and includes others that I missed. It's the old **what exists is possible no matter what theory says it isn't**. I've never looked at this particular report before, but its existence says that what I suggested is not just 'possible' but is done on a routine basis. 




 Wow. Thanks for the photo. 




 Ah, the faith that moves mountains. Here's a short list of some agencies that regularly track and report on the magnitude of the 'gender pay gap': the US Census, the International Labor Organization, the United Nations Development Program, the World Bank, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the International Monetary Fund, the United States Congress Joint Economic Committee, the European Commission (technical advisers to the EU), the US Department of Commerce. The list could be expanded into *many* dozens of items, all of them produced by *real, credible, legitimate economists* who are hired for such work. The number of papers on the subject that appear in peer reviewed economics journals *each year* probably amounts to *thousands* if all languages are surveyed. 

The world knows, people who study these things in academic settings know. Business knows. Everyone knows...except for those that deliberately close their eyes for emotional reasons. Please present your stunning discovery that the scientific study of this issue is part of a 'man-hating plot' to the UN General Assembly. The nations of the World await your enlightenment.

All the information is available on the internet. Look it up. 




 Thanks for the info. 




 I said it would be difficult to make a single comparable number out of it, but I also said it wasn't impossible. Somewhat but not entirely subjective. The important point is that many of these metrics are covariant. 




 There's a good history of that available on the internet. See Randall Watters' article [her](http://freeminds.org/psych/propfail.htm) 




 I know. 'Dogan' isn't common slang anymore. It was when I was young. 




 Those are dates when the Watchtower Society predicted the second coming previously. Needless to say it didn't happen. 




 There are other metrics such age of marriage, inheritance rights, divorce laws, female genital mutilation, induced abortions of female fetuses, legal standing in civil suits, different civil laws in other matters, maternal mortality in childbirth, differential spending on gynecology and obstetrics as opposed to other medical fields, differences in status in religious services, etc. that are indicators. It would indeed be difficult to assign weights to the various factors, but I think it is not beyond the realm of possibility.  




 That's good to see. The only possible solution, other than partition amongst the surrounding countries - with the continued war that would mean - is a federal one. One can only hope the various groups can come to an acceptable agreement. The Swiss in times past proved it isn't impossible. 




 Are you referring to the dates the JWs predicted the end of the world or some dates on the video ? 




 No problem. No, not me. I'm an 'ex-Dogan'. I left the RC Church when I was 15, and never looked back. I'm an old fart now with the usual arthritis and reduced eyesight. I have, however, known ex-Jehovahs in my time, and it is indeed a particularly vicious religion. Also, can we say, 'weird'.  




 The original source of the video was [JWStruggle](http://www.youtube.com/user/JWStruggle) . The producer has several episodes of his trial/interrogation there. I'm afraid, however, that he doesn't seem to have any written summary as far as I can tell. Sorry I couldn't help you more. Have a quick look at the site. 




 It's a speculation, but a reasonable one when the other factors are excluded as the authors have done.. It certainly doesn't constitute 'proof', if any such proof one way or the other could be offered in a case like this. As I mentioned in a reply to another poster the UN tracks the gap year by year in various countries. Comparing the magnitude with reference to said countries' attitudes towards women would go a long was towards supporting or weakening the authors' explanation. 




 Yes, it seems to be downvoted. I've been in this argument before. I guess this sub is patrolled by the 'Resentment Patrol'. The gender gap is a well established fact, and every year the United Nations produces a report showing its magnitude in different countries. I think the link is quite well researched and properly balanced. At least somebody agrees with this. Thanks. 




 I don't believe so, but I'll look. 




 The one year that the NYC Anarchist Bookfair was most severely disrupted was 2012. I seem to recall a previous incident, but beginning in 2009 (the year when the Crimethink Conference you mention was disrupted) there have been several incidents in several cities. The Crimethink incident was carried out by a group who styled themselves 'Smack A White Boy'. See http://libcom.org/library/smack-a-white-boy-part-two-crimethink-eviction-2009 for a full account. Also various Crimethink statements at the time.

 Be aware that the "part 2" bit refers to a previous action earlier in that year. that the  'smacky' group carried out . On March 21, 2009 a commie front (Answer I believe) was having an antiwar march in Washington DC. The 'smackies' conceived the idea of trying to block the march. Their justification - are you ready ? - "to stand in solidarity with the people of Iraq and Palestine". I shit you not. How (trying to) blocking a commie front march in Washington 'helps' the people of Iraq and Palestine' I will leave up to your imagination. No doubt they lined up in their millions to sign a huge thank-you card. To my knowledge the commies simply walked around the small group and nothing spectacular happened. All went well, and the cherry trees blossomed as usual.

Back to Crimethink. The numbers of disrupters reported vary. One Crimethink statement said "about a half dozen". By the Smacky statement they claimed " 8 people", and once more according to them "from 7 different locations". The smackies wanted to make a video of their grand victory, but once more to my knowledge it came to nothing except for the following: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dHcRnOOXEA . It didn't go viral. The group dissolved into the chaotic air of USA anarchism, a tangled forest where many things have been lost forever. 

I have further references if you'd like. Now *here's the point that impressed me*. Eight people from *7 locations* ! How well did the disrupters know each other before - *if they knew each other at all beyond the world of email* ? Think about that for awhile.  




 The updates on the situation in Kurdistan are greatly appreciated. For myself I think that the Kurds in Syria and Turkey have a sufficiently laudable program (and efforts on the ground) to be supported, and their enemies are more than sufficiently evil to make up for any deficiencies the Kurdish polity might have. From what I see in the efforts of the European anarchist and syndicalist groups to offer what help they can I think they have made the right decision, that is support without having any illusions about the 'mixed' character of the part(ies !) in Kurdistan. It seems reasonable to me, and I certainly wouldn't try to sum up such a complex situation in a few sweeping generalizations. 

Personally I think the relationship the Spanish CGT has had with the EZLN for quite a few years is something of a model. They offer the support they can without engaging in long distance hero worship, reading things into the Zapatistas that aren't there or (worst of all as I have seen recently) using the Zapatistas as some sort of stick to beat other leftists over the head with for 'thinking unclean thoughts' (colonial maybe ?). On the other hand neither do they hold the EZLN to some artificial standard of purity that is never achieved in the real world.

All that being said I am still not over optimistic about the prospects for the Kurds. This isn't connected to any estimation of the virtues that they have or may not have. It's all about the place in the world and the time in history in which all this is happening. The Kurds are surrounded on all sides by enemies or potential enemies that have significant military strength, Turkey, Iran, Israel, Saudi Arabia, let alone all the weaker players, from Hezbollah, ISIS, other Kurdish factions, other Islamic factions, Syrian 'government', Iraqi 'government' and so on. Then there are the external players from the USA, EU, Russia.

The best that I could envision for the Kurds would be regional autonomy within the boundaries of present states with a greater or lesser amount of autonomy, probably less than that of a Swiss canton. To achieve this the Kurds will inevitably have to compromise, with each other as well as with the neighbours and distant interested parties. The present oil pipelines don't flow through Kurdish Syria, but they *do* flow through Kurdish areas of Turkey. Then there is Iran, a state not known for its willingness to compromise.

With all these shifting interests I also think that the best the Kurds can achieve outside of political autonomy is a more or less mixed economy. I hope that this economy would have a considerable communal and cooperative sector, but it simply won't be anything that Western leftists might dream of. In this case the pipers to be paid have a lot more hardware to use as argument.

Not that compromises, both political and economic, are worthless. I can hope that the political autonomy will be greater rather than lesser and similarly the economic compromises will be more 'to the left' than otherwise, but I certainly don't know and I think nobody can know where the ball will finally stop rolling.  




 I understand that they have set a few 'end times' before, and it didn't seem to depopulate them when the event never happened. Was the book 'When Prophecy Fails' written with them at least partially in mind ? 




 As a point of interest regarding the New York Anarchist Bookfair it was disrupted in past years (twice I believe) by a small contingent from 'Sergeant Fury and his PC Commandos'. I'll dig up the years involved. 




 A Twinkie a day keeps....you from forgetting where you left the Twinkies. 




 Interesting article. I liked the part where Blackwater has changed its name to 'Academi'. Maybe the mercs are being trained in post-modernist torture methods. One thing I don't remember...how were the murders brought to light and how was the government pressured to prosecute ? 




 It's working now. A good project even if the report is dated from early February. Still relevant. 




 Neat. Thanks. 




 A long and tedious explanation of the background to this post will follow soon. The premises at 33 rue des Vignoles in Paris house the offices of the anarchosyndicalist CNT-f, one of several anarchosyndicalist and revolutionary sysndicalist union confederations in France (the situation is even more complex than in Spain). The premises have been handed down over decades from Spanish exiles who were members of the Spanish CNT.

Spanish anarchist exiles played a prominent part in the Liberation of France. The 'Nueve' referred to above and below were the *first* Free French units to enter Paris on its Liberation, riding on tanks prominatly labeled with names such as 'Durruti' and 'Ascaso' Ever since 2011 there have been efforts on the part of the city of Paris to evict the occupants and a continued struggle to maintain the anarchist presence there.

In the meantime here's the English translation of the post.

                    

**33 Rue Des Vignoles Has a Future**

That is, in any case, what has been proclaimed by the presence of almost 500 people who came in to support  the Les Pas Sages des Vignoles association this Sunday, March 22.

The future of this place is first that the entities there, artists, Flamenco in France and the CNT, continue their activities now as they have for more than thirty years. This longevity proves that, despite differences, living and working together is possible. This day under the signs of 'Nueve' and 'antifasacist, republican and libertarian Spain' demonstrated it again.

All available premises were opened, members, students of Flamenco in France and CNT militants; the artists have worked hand in hand for the success of this day which concluded with a concert where the cultures of the Balkans, Gipsies and Flamenco were mixed.

In the afternoon the film '*La Nueve or the forgotten victory*' allowed the new Hispanic generations present, the neighbours of the Quarter and everyone to discover an often overlooked part of the history of the Liberation of Paris and also to support the claim brought by the Les Pas Sages de Vignoles association : to keep the present occupants and also devote a space dedicated to what made the history of 33.

These women and men who, from 1936 in Spain until the end of their days in Paris at 33, devoted their lives to liberty. They 'had' been revolutionaries in the Spanish war, members of the French Resistance, soldiers in the Free French Forces, survivors of the Mauthausen Camp, anti-Franco combatants, they were and still are living members of the CNT. A mini-exhibition in the halls gave life to this reality.

The Association Les Pas Sages des Vignoles will continue its efforts to keep the occupants and the opening of a space dedicated to antifascist and libertarian republican Spain at 33 Vignoles.

Finally, we thank all the people who came to support us who came as individuals or as members of the support committee.

For those who want to support us a petition can be signed online at https://www.change.org/p/mairie-de-paris-d%C3%A9fense-du-33-rue-des-vignoles-pour-que-vive-le-paris-populaire

 **Second Round: Second Libertarian Spring Day in Havana**

El Taller Libertario Alfredo Lpez, Locacin Cristo Salvador, y El Guardabosques

We are calling the Second Libertarian Spring Day in Havana to be held from May 29 to June 7, 2015. An open space with dynamic, anti-authoritarian and anti-capitalist process having forms of sociability and awareness based on horizontality, mutual learning and accountability.

We intend this day to be, as its name suggests, the evocation of a spring shoot of libertarian ideals whose roots, despite all historical adversity, always seek the right keys for a new breath, new routes for further exploration and possibilities for struggle and transformation.

The Conference will be structured along the following lines:

*Practices, resistance, autonomy, self-organization, solidarity, mutuality and networks

*Art and anti-authoritarian creation

*The new scene of interstate relations between Cuba and the United States

*Diversity: racial, sexual, gender, class, territorial, cultural and others

*Environmentalism, technology and action

We hope for your communication and thank you in advance for any help in promoting this event.

Havana, April 12, 2015

 OK I'll be kind. You've designed a 'nutbot' to supposedly identify nuts, libertarian spammers, and reply incoherently to them. The trouble is that the bot is either barely literate or it drinks on the job. What it does is tag mention of certain names or phrases and makes a silly comeback. What it *isn't* doing properly is to actually see what a post is all about. I went through its first 7 or 8 'hits', and two other posts were misidentified as 'libertarian' when they were the precise opposite. The bot needs a lot of work. Either that or taking the pledge. 




 Oh, a 'nutbot'. I guess it's fun for somebody who can't accomplish anything real in life.

 A nit well picked. Tolkien was indeed born RC. His mother converted to Catholicism, and she was determined that her children would be "well Churched". The term 'Anglo-Catholic' spans an expanse of views, all the way from fairly orthodox High Anglicans (Episcopalians in the US) whose theology differs from that of Roman Catholicism in significant ways, through shadings within the Anglican Communion, to independent Churches that are halfway between to the 'Anglican Rite' (a thing that Benedict XVI - fondly known as Pope Rottweiller to some - initiated and is still a matter of debate/negotiation) to full acceptance of the rules and rites of the Latin Rite. 

It's a complex matter, and to me it isn't surprising that Tolkien was 'upset' about Lewis only going 'half-way' from Tolkien's point of view. The shades of opinion in what is called 'Anglo-Catholicism' can seem opaque to an outsider. Very much as debates about Christology/The Trinity are to even the vast majority of Christians. Splits in leftist politics often look exactly as strange to non-leftists. Yes, I still think 'Anglo-Catholic' is a good term for Tolkien because he was part of that broad intellectual milieu. 

Other than that I am glad you pointed out that the man was indeed born Catholic. His religion was, to him, a much more important thing than any politics, and looking at his life from that point of view can really help dispel some of the misconceptions about his opinions. 




 Oh shit. I guess the item wasn't as reliable as I thought. 




 It's an interesting essay (almost a book), and it will take time to read and digest it all. Thanks for the contribution. 




 That's hardly surprising. Like his fellow fantasy writer C.S. Lewis Tolkien was an 'anglocatholic' with all that implied. All politics aside his loyalty to the Church meant that reports of the early atrocities during the Spanish Revolution impressed him greatly. There's more than one level of irony in this. First of all it was not the 'Communists' who engaged in anti-religious action but rather the anarchists. It was many months before the then miniscule PCE was able to exert any influence other than through their PSOE/PSUC allies. The second irony is that the atrocities were brought to an end in the space of about 2 months... by the anarchists themselves who brought the 'uncontrollable' elements under control. The reports of these events lasted longer than the events themselves. The final irony is that Tolkien' s economic views, basically Catholic 'Distributionism' were closer to anarchism than to any other more popular political trend. History can be, and is, messy. 




 It sets off my 'ick reflex'. While I'm not a big fan of chicken (I prefer beef) I haven't had great experiences with 'soy anything'. I guess it would depend upon process as you suggest. I gather you don't have extensive experience either. To be honest the sort of place I'd be most likely to meet such a thing would be in a vegan restaurant, and I avoid them like the plague. There are indeed vegetarian dishes that are appealing, but you pretty well have to go to an Indian restaurant to find them. 




 In a way yes. The researchers in the paper cited plucked hairs a certain distance from each other. What they tried to show was that this action led to the skin cells sensing the 'damage' and sending chemical signals to hair follicles to initiate hair growth. My analogy wasn't really proper. 'Shaving' is more like driving a lawnmower over your garden. Mowing a lawn certainly has effects on subsequent grass growth, though I think it is more a matter of altering the local environment of a grass shoot (more light) than of chemical communication. I might be wrong on this. Digging the whole thing up is like pulling out all the hairs in a given area of the scalp. Thus neither you nor I chose the proper example. 




 Thank you. 




 I never thought of that. Possibly yes. 




 Yes, but this is 'shaving' rather than selective 'plucking'. 




 Not really. From my reading of this the plucking was quite selective and well spaced. It was more like thinning the plants in a garden rather than ploughing the whole thing down. 




 The war widened as Coke came in on the American side, and Pepsi declared its allegiance to Russia. The small nation of Burger King was obliterated as the rival armies fought in out on their buns. China seized the opportunity and overran Siberia in a 'take-out' move. Russia struck back with its nuclear Subway fleet. In the end the combatants met for a peace conference at the Pizza Hut. When the armistice treat was finally signed the Taco Bells rang out across the world. 




 I wonder what the 'imitation chicken' is made of. 




 I've never heard of 'Lyfe Kitchens'. How is it doing ? 




 Thanks. 




 The votes are up and down. The article mentions one other Supreme Court ruling on a piece of Saskatchewan legislation that was taken as a sort of precedent in these cases. I think the answer to your question is that each new piece of legislation has to be challenged separately in court. 




 I guess I'll have to leave out the non-political magazines and sources as well as the ones that come to my door in physical space. I'll put in a list later today. 




 It's good to see that you are posting from both sides of this dispute. That is obviously what *should* be done, and it is the kind of openness that I'd like to see a lot more of. 




 Yes. 'Mostly' is not exactly a precise mathematical term. 




 It's been many years now, but I can remember the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline hearings. Many of the objections raised then would still be relevant. 




 The two pipeline proposals discussed in the article are both exclusively in Canadian territory. The article also mentions a non-pipeline proposal, a railroad that terminates in Valdez Alaska, but this isn't the major subject. 




 It sounds like a Riel idea. I've always wondered how Dumont could stand some of Louis' bizarre ideas. 




 There has to be a fly in the ointment somewhere in there. I got it. Melting permafrost becomes muskeg. Trying to build pipelines on muskeg is a futile task.  




 There certainly are a lot of problems. Can you imagine having to deal with a pipeline breakage around the time of spring melt ? 




 Yeah. I wonder how much (ap)peal they have. That's a bit too slippery to pin down.  




 It actually is amusing. :) 




 This had me going for awhile. There actually *is* an old inactive sub called r/banarchism. Plus one called r/The_Banarchist and a user of the same name. The little cult that controls meta relish the attention no matter how much they may say otherwise. 




 Sorry my mistake. I've made this goof before, but I forgot. 




 There's a lot of unknowns in trying to decide if these protests are a good idea or not. The worst case scenario, aside from a coup d'tat by the right, would be if Syriza fails in its game of chicken with the Troika but retains a broad base of support amongst the population. Guess who will be looked at as 'traitors' in that case.

There are a lot of things happening in Greece beyond the flashy news of riots. I'm thinking mainly of gradual expansion of the self-managed sector of the economy. Health care collectives/worker coops for instance have grown tremendously. This is hardly due to some thought-out plan by anarchists but rather because of the initiative of ordinary people.

Win or lose against the government the Greek anarchists show little sign of having any plans for either victory or defeat.

 




 Yes, they are used in some schools and wanted by some in many others. The first thing that comes to my mind is that such a measure automatically gives an advantage to teachers in schools that draw from a wealthier demographic in comparison to those teaching in schools where the pupils come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. It can happen that a teacher in a poorer school has done a remarkable job in generally inspiring his or her students, but if compared to his more privileged colleague in a wealthy school he or she may comes off in such a crude metric as 'inferior'. This can happen even if the teacher in a wealthy school is quite slack. 




 But I don't think it will give you infallibility. Yeah, I know...the title. 




 Or, from another point of view, be persuaded to give the pursuit of their own interests less importance than the elevation of a new ruling class to power, a class that would 'supposedly' look after their interests for them. Many socialists of Lenin's day saw 'What is to be Done' as not only a naked justification of tyranny but also as a blueprint for how not the workers but rather a class recruited from and directed by the intelligentsia would gain power using the workers as pawns.

The most cogent critic amongst Lenin's contemporaries was perhaps Jan Waclaw Machajski. To my knowledge his 'The Intellectual Worker' is still unavailable in English. His views are, however, well set forth in ['State Socialism'](http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/jan-waclaw-machajski-state-socialism). 




 Yes, that's my opinion as well. It leads to a great 'what to do'. 




 There's a long ideological argument behind that. Many have argued that the people who come to power in a Leninist revolution are generally not from the 'working class' (pretty well universally true) and that they create what is actually a new ruling class over and against the workers whom they claim to be representing. See Milovan Djilas' 'The New Class' amongst many other writings on the subject. If I were a Marxist I'd call this a 'contradiction' between the official ideology and the economic reality. 




 There is a good collection at the [Marxists.Org](http://www.marxists.org/subject/left-wing) . The site has links to archives of various authors who wrote in that tradition. There used to be a better collection, but it has gone bye-bye because it was on Geocities. 




 It might be a difficult point in law, but the general argument would be under the heading of "possession of goods obtained by crime". Suppose you are an ordinary citizen who (unknowingly of course) purchases an item from 'Sneaky Steven'. Further suppose that somehow said item was traced to your possession after Sneaky was caught. The law says, and it has justification, that the real owner is the victim of the theft, and the item has to be returned to him or her. Your loss of the purchase money to Sneaky is not considered to be an excuse for you to not return the item.

These sort of cases happen routinely. Cases involving money are less common, but the same principle should apply. Whether the Church is legally *forced* to return the money depends upon two things. One; their legal objections. Note carefully that they hired an attorney to present their case. The second influence is *willingness to prosecute*. Their apparent escape is probably very much due to the latter.

Once more, think of it as if you were the victim of a crime. Fraud is just as criminal as breaking and entering, and the victim should be able to recover the money lost to fraud, even if a third party now possesses it.

As to the fact that the money has already been spent - that would *not* absolve an individual in the same position as the Church. No doubt a deal would be worked out to repay in installments - just as the Church should. They do, after all, have an income. I doubt they are like the birds of the air and the flowers of the field.

Devil's advocates are always welcome. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints relies heavily on them. It's always good to ask questions.

Natural justice I believe it's called. 




 Well, if I was a contractor hired to install new marble tabletops in the Pastor's house I'd be as pleased as punch. 




 Freedom to keep stolen money is, of course, 'religious freedom', to some. Didn't the Rabbi in the Gospels have something to say about a golden god ? The only 'freedom' here is 'free' money obtained by the 'freedom' to steal. 




 It's a bit off the subject, but there's a Far Side cartoon about dogs and coprophagia. It goes like this:

*The panel has a 'kid dog' with tears streaming down his face standing in front of an older dog in a chair with a blanket over his lap (to give the impression of age).*

*The caption reads:  "I'll have you know that your grandfather ate shit, that his father ate shit and his father before him ate shit. There's nothing wrong with eating shit.... and don't ever let any cat tell you otherwise."*

Yep, it's an old dog habit. 




 No, but it may be a way to get campaign donations from energy companies. 




 It's an expanding field of research for sure. It's interesting that the work described here doesn't involve modification of the microbiome but rather modification of the body's response to it. Two sides of one coin. 




 I see no reason to forbid it. Cooking can remove any potential harm. Personally it triggers my 'ick reflex', but I don't think that things that I think are 'icky' should necessarily be banned. 




 Less 'unified' than a globe-spanning agricultural corporate feudalism by far. 




 It's a complicated relationship for sure. 




 Yep, I had a look and it's pretty wild. The Global Times is actually a government approved site. I read it because despite its status a lot of real news is published there. It's not like in the 'bad old days' when the Chinese press was basically a wall of rhetoric. 




 It's getting harder and harder for the US prison system to obtain the drugs they use. As the article mentions the AMA and the US anaesthetist association have passed resolutions saying it is unethical for their members to supply drugs for executions or for them to participate in them. The pharmaceutical companies themselves have refused to supply the drugs domestically, and they have also taken a position against supplying them from overseas. This is only partly from humanitarian motives. The companies have to be compliant with European law. The 'compounding' mentioned is when a pharmacist takes a chemical and modifies its form ie it is *not* the original drug. The originals are forbidden because of the laws and policies mentioned. Compounded products are only *theoretically* safe and effective. Almost none of the formulations used have ever been tested in a proper trial.

My prediction is that the US prison system will soon start ordering drugs from suppliers in India with all that implies. I'm sure it has been discussed in the proverbial 'back rooms'. The speed bump would be that it would be hard to make a profit with the relatively small amounts that would be ordered, and hence the deal wouldn't be attractive to Indian manufacturers. They presently make good money with antibiotics, but unfortunately not *all* manufacturers in that country have anything like quality control. 




 That might be the most democratic solution. 




 The IWA-AIT *was* present in the form of the Spanish CNT. There is a report on the event on their website. I just haven't got around to translating it yet. The meeting, however, was more of an informal gathering rather than one of organizations. 




 There are more problems with Stanchev's article than just a confusion between anarchists and left communists, but I'll deal with those elsewhere. For now I'll merely add to what you have said.

Saying that the 'anarchist milieu' is "slightly" larger than the left-com one is true understatement. Left communism had its glory days following 1968, and it was incapable of finding any particular field of action that might turn it from an intellectual hobby into a real political force. In other words it missed the bus, and said bus won't be coming by again. 

The ICC, for instance, is to all aspects virtually invisible, and it would be impossible to tell if it had 10 or 20 people worldwide. I see their propaganda now and then, mostly in Libcom, but I can't force myself to read more than a paragraph or two at a time. I also know one person who claims to have met an actual ICC member *in the flesh*. The ICC are so irrelevant that these two claims together may make me something of a 'world's expert' on them.

Be that as it may anarchist opinions vary, as they should, about the nature and prospects of the revolution in Kurdistan. There is nothing wrong with looking at what is happening there dispassionately. The Dauv article, of course, crosses the line into sectarian attack, and it also spends an inordinate amount of time on matters that are either irrelevant or make sense only to those conversant with the private language of leftism.

It should be noted that the British Anarchist Federation is part of the [International of Anarchist Federations](http://www.i-f-a.org) that has affiliates across Europe and South America. Anyone can look at their websites to see the general support for the Kurds, support that like that of the AF extends into the real world and out of the politically correct circles of fans of things like ROAR magazine. You have also pointed out the activity of the platformist oriented groups which hasn't been minuscule. 

The IWA-AIT doesn't seem to have a generally accepted position on the Kurdistan issue, but they have no generally accepted position on a whole lot of things. Judging from the position of the Spanish CNT they are most definitely 'pro-Kurd', and given the nature of the IWA-AIT I think that pretty well goes for the international sections as well.

The anarchosyndicalist unions outside of the AIT such as the CGT of Spain, the CNT-f of France and the SAC of Sweden have been quite active in promotion of the Kurdish cause, and given that they are larger than the AIT affiliates they have also been able to offer tangible material aid. Other IFA affiliates such as the Fdration anarchiste of France have also been consistent supporters of the Kurds.

In sum the non-English speaking anarchist movement has been consistently and effectively active in support of the revolution in Kurdistan. Many have reservations about the nature of events there and have voiced them, but they are hardly sectarian purists such as those Stanchev pillories. Stanchev's article uses the example of *one* left communist author to attack not just other left communists but also anarchists that he knows full well don't fit into the picture of his strawman. One might wonder about his real purposes, but, as I said, leave that for later. 




 I guess that's likely. Ah, *politicians*. 




 You're welcome. I checked, and what I wrote before is basically accurate. There were, however, two fatalities not one. As of now the fire has been classed as accidental. 




 I'll have to check the reports, but my memory says that the fire began in a residential unit near to the AK Press warehouse. I believe there was one fatality. In other words AK was more of a 'bystander' to this event. The damage to their stock was from smoke and water.

I don't know about the general measures that the landlord (they rent a spot in a complex owned by somebody else) took or didn't take as to fire safety, and the legal responsibility of the landlord is they weren't 'up to code'. In many (most ?) jurisdictions in North America landlords are required to have working fire alarms in their units. There may be places where sprinkler systems are required in commercial units, but I *think* there are not many of those. The premises were mixed commercial/residential. I'll be back to you when I check the details of the event. 




 Thanks. I missed the man himself in my search. Much appreciated. 




 I think you're right. My understanding of it is that a mutation in a suppressor gene essentially causes it to make an inoperative product. Perhaps, however, if the mutation weren't in said gene itself but in its allied 'controllers' there may be a possibility. Say that p51 is controlled by a set of promoters, initiators and its own suppressers, and a mutation at a different site "supressed the suppressor(s) of the suppressor". Complicated....yes.  




 It's true about his previous record, but hopefully, as you say, his present opinion is a bit more stable. I know....stable opinions and principles from a politician ?????? 




 Thanks for the warning. I didn't think of the possibility that someone might try foxglove as a DIY experiment. People do things that are inconceivable to me. 




 Arnie as Arnie or Arnie as Conan ? I never knew that. Where can I find him here ?

Edit: It's OK. I found the r/arnoldschwartzenegger subreddit. Neat. Next I'll go looking for Conan. 




 I'm glad you pointed out some of the complications here, but I am puzzled about one thing. I can't think of any situation where licensing is "a tool to keep markets competitive". Maybe it's just too late at night and my mind is in cruise control, but can you give an example ? 




 Oh shit. Trouble follows me wherever I go. As the 'copyee' I'm not too upset though I am quite puzzled as to the why and how. I post in a great number of different forums, some of them quite far removed from the anarchist ideology and some of them not political at all. Occasionally I may make a mistake and 'double post' in the same forum even though I have a general procedure for trying to avoid this. At other times I am #2 in a given forum (usually on matters scientific or technical), and the moderators of a given board remove the duplicate and inform me of same. No problem from my point of view. Reddit is often inaccurate in informing a poster of duplicate status. Gotta go for Easter dinner so I'll be back on this later. Good luck, and I advise diplomacy. 




 Yes, but this situation is a bit different. For one he is a Republican. The second point is his fame because of his film career. As you say there are scores of politicians who disagree with such laws, but 'Conan' is more newsworthy than most others. 




 Why not now ? The guy should have watched himself. The Gayluminaty of Vienna have agents everywhere. ;) 




 You and me both. Trying to find interesting subreddits on reddit can be, let us say, "interesting". I'd suggest that the moderators take a look at further promotion of this site. 




 I once read an article that tried to list all the opposition groups in Syria. To say the least there are many. The groups divide along not just religious, ethnic and ideological lines but also along geographic and even personal lines. To make it worse the groups often change their name, ally and un-ally with others. Makes it hard to keep track. 




 ;) .I guess the old 'da debil made me do it' is out of fashion. 




 Cosmology...the game ?  




 That could be amusing. 




 True, but going from here it comes to the classic conclusion of academic papers..."further research is required". 




 Yes, like you I see progress, but the trend is not inevitable. 




 I doubt that that is possible or it just wouldn't be fermentation. Perhaps, however, my imagination is limited. Culture in the presence of carbon dioxide absorbers ? Reutilization of CO2 for other purposes such as organic chemical feedstocks ? Your point is well taken. 




 Thanks for the contribution. I'd be the last to deny that there are 'problems in the house of labor'. To some extent the unions are already reaching out beyond their membership to other unions, social movements and the public at large. There is still a long way to go. The perceived opposition between 'jobs and the environment' as illustrated by your quotation above is a pretty clear example. Union members have to recognize that they aren't just workers but are also members of the community. Reconciling the two 'goods' is a work that is very much in progress. 




 Thank you. That saves me some work in regards to the Kurds. As for pure 'humanitarian' donations for those who want to avoid all politics there is the [Syrian Red Crescent](http://sarc.sy). Be aware that I am unfamiliar with this outfit. I hope it isn't like the Red Cross where 1)you have no control over *what* your donation goes to ie not always the particular call you responded to and 2) a far too large amount of revenue goes to 'administration'. there is also the [UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs](http://www.unocha.org/syria). With this outfit you can be assured that the money donated will go to the cause specified. I don't, however, know about the 'administration overhead'. It's probably less than that of the Red Cross given funding from the UN itself.

I've got to remember to add these pathways to solidarity in future. The donation path is contained in the SFF, but it is hidden in the website. 




 Thank you. I'll be on alert for that. 




 Not really. The article mentions the natural disasters, but it is mainly concerned with the structural deficiencies due to (mainly) American influence in that country. The two are not necessarily unconnected. A country's ability to recover from natural disasters depends on the capacity of its infrastructure and organization. Haiti's history has left it dramatically deficient in the sort of 'civil society' organizations that quite frequently help recovery more than either the government or foreign aid NGOs. In connection with the latter there are numerous accounts of how aid 'pledges' are not being fulfilled or of how the money is pissed away or wasted on useless projects once it does arrive.

I can appreciate your feeling that the left, most particularly the American left, overemphasizes the role of American foreign policy and corporations in every single problem anywhere in the world. I put it this way; "Americans are the most patriotic nation on Earth. They are under the illusion that all that is good in the world only exists because of the USA. If Americans "catch leftism" they switch over to blaming the US for everything bad anywhere. This attitude is just as patriotic as the first. All it does is switch the adjectives." In this case, however, throwing rocks at the White House is the proper description to a first approximation.

As a side note of interest anarchists have a dog in this fight. In the past the Haitian union Bataille  Ouvrire has collaborated with anarchosyndicalists and other anarchists. I'm not up to date on what their organization has been doing recently. 




 Thank you. I've already made the post I wanted stickied. Hopefully it will work with editing. I'll see. You've been a great help. 




 Stranger things have happened. There are evangelical Christian Churches that are *definitely* on the left on many issues. 




 I wonder if r/anarchism and r/metanarchism are indeed the top of the mocking list at subs like r/SubRedditDrama ? I've seen it said that the two most popular clowns of stage, screen and politics were u/Laurelai and u/volcanoclosto .  




 True. There are advantages. 




 Please see reply to u/audiored 




 The group that sponsors the [Syria Freedom Forever](http://syriafreedomforever.wordpress.com) page is the [Revolutionary Left Current in Syria](http://revleftcurrentsyria.com). If you look at the link 'Support and Solidarity with the Revolutionary Left Current in Syria' on their page banner. You will see the information for donations to their work in Syria.

In the interests of transparency it should be noted that the Revolutionary Left Current are Trotskyist in orientation. They are, however, very non-sectarian, and given the situation in the many sided Syrian civil war a donation to them is also a donation to others such as the Kurds with whom they are in alliance.

Personally I don't share their political opinions, but I still feel that they are progressive in the context they operate in. There are many sides there, the Assad government, ISIS, the al-Nusra al-Qaeda branch franchise, the Kurds and a plethora of other groups based on ethnicity and/or political positions. Within that fractured 'others' grouping some are quite content to be essentially American puppets while others look towards a more non-aligned and/or socialist future.

The Kurds have mounted a much wider network for international solidarity through their anarchist allies. I will provide links to them as well as non-political relief agencies ( for those who are uncomfortable with *any* political group) later today.

  




 Yes, that's interesting isn't it. 




 Yes, I'll agree. The goal is clear and not befuddled by other side issues. Like you I think that clarity is important.  




 I see. I'm not immediately familiar with either the brewing or the wine industry though I am familiar with other parts of agriculture. As a point of interest one side of my family were vintners way back and far, far away, but it is more than a few worlds away. Talk about cows and wheat (or even barley or oats) and I can hold a sensible conversation. I did have an uncle by marriage who worked in a winery (and grew his own grapes from Italy for his own wine in his backyard), but that's about all for an immediate connection.

I thank you very much for your contribution even though I still think that beer and wine are a bit more 'civilized' than bottled water. Nestl has an unadmirable record in many places in the world, not just in California, and I still see the point of the demonstrators. 




 True. My own personal political beliefs favor the maximum possible amount of decentralization *possible*. The key word is 'possible'. There are difficulties in the application of decentralization, and I think it should be more an often unrealizable ideal rather than an ideological 'demand'. How this works out in the gradual process of social change I can't and I think nobody can give simplistic and dogmatic answers. Practice makes perfect, and it also makes real.

Thanks for your opinions. 




 Your numbers appear to be correct. The 'water footprint' of brewing is in the ranges you suggest even though 98% of the *total* water accounting is prior to brewing in the cultivation of barley and hops. 




 That's a good point. My mind got fixated on bottles. As I said I'll look. Thank you. 




 You might be right. The articles I remember were about crops for human consumption. The alfalfa fields that I am familiar with, however, are not irrigated. It might be different in drier places. More stuff to look up. 




 That's interesting. I'm going to have to look up the process. All that I know immediately is from 'home-brewing' where basically 1 gallon of water equals one gallon of beer minus minor loss via waste. Working from basic principles there would have to be some very large dump of waste water from causes I am unfamiliar with given that the main process of beer production after fermentation is filtration to improve clarity. Bottle washing ? Hopefully back to you later. 




 No problem. 




 All microbiology aside the taste of well water that puts some people off is basically from two chemical factors: hardness and nitrate content. The first is basically harmless, but *I* can tell the taste difference. To me bottled water often tastes 'flat'. Despite all the endless mineral content that is sometimes listed on the label it hardly ever seems 'hard'. Some of this may also be due to the lack of the chlorinated hydrocarbons that often give tap water its taste. One thing that should be noted however. There has been more than one case where so-called 'spring water', 'mineral water', whatever has been nothing more than the tap water of the town where the plant is located.

Your illness was probably due to bacterial or parasitic causes which can be a community-wide problem or just leaky pipes in a neighbourhood or single residence. High nitrate concentrations can lead to diarrhea but rarely to vomiting in my knowledge. 




 I don't know. It seems like a question that could be answered. 




 I'd have to consult a time zone map. As of now it's about 16:00 GMT. If you go east 8 times zones then it is indeed tomorrow. I guess that's Beijing time. Yeah, that's right. Noon is quite arbitrary. 




 The water quality of tap water varies with the location, treatment used and time of year. Personally I grew up in a small 'town' (to overstate the case) where all water was well water. It got stinky at times, but few people got sick from it. I guess we all adjusted. Sometimes that's impossible. I know of one reservation that has had a 'boil water' advisory for upwards of 17 years, and there may be worse cases. Back in the days when I had money to travel one of the first things I'd do when the plane touched down is immediately drink the local water. Sort of get it over with.

In any case one thing I know about the issue from reading about it over the years... there is *no* guarantee that bottled water will be any better than tap water except in regards to the market-sensitive matter of 'taste'. Sometimes it's worse. 




 I guess, but try to remember that life is not an online game. It's *real*. Please also try and remember that pretty well *all* of the protestors care about the issue, not about theater. 




 I guess, but try to remember that life is not an online game. It's *real*. 




 Two peas, same pod. 




 Well, now that I`ve been mercifully banned from r/anarchism I can speak my mind. As far as 'leftydom' goes I've been around from before the time most of the r/metanarchism cult's *parents* were in diapers. Here's the problem: as I see it *both* the fake anarchists *and* the 'tankies' as you call them have been gradually dumbed down over the last few decades. There is some commonality between the two groups for the simple reason that both have been sinking in both quality and public appeal for a long time.

Commies are, of course, strange, and given their youth they have no memory of what Leninism in power actually was. They mirror the bizarros who want to reanimate fascism, and their is now exchange of personnel between them, the faux-anarchists and the nostalgic fascists. To a large extent the motives behind adherence to any one of these so-called 'options' is the same - identity seeking amongst a large group of empty lost people.

The faux-anarchists look like the 'tankies' because their causes, their convoluted 'theory' and their motivation are the same. A lot of this, at least the crude justification of it, can be blamed on my own generation. Politically correct Maoists gave up on 'The Revolution', went into academic careers and kept their attitudes intact. They taught them to new generations with different targets for totalitarianism but the same methods.

Have hope. Most of these fuckers took the early retirements from academia that they qualified for. Demographics will do what argument cannot. 




 Yes, I remember reading about water requirements for various crops, and I seem to recall that almonds were the highest. 




 What it is is getting *exactly* the same physical result without the cost of loss of public sympathy and legal complications. All that is 'lost' by using the tactics they did is some sense of personal superiority. People can live without that.

As an interesting contrast I posted this item elsewhere, and an opponent of the action waded in with a complaint that the police "didn't enforce the law". That person made the same mistake you do only he was on the other side. The police got their job done without loss of public sympathy and with far less complications than adding in with clubs swinging.

The protesters knew their job, and the police knew theirs. Each side acted to get what they wanted with the least cost.

Cost and benefit.  




 No where near the amount of guns dedicated to protecting the ability of business to exploit their workers. No where near. 




 That gives all sorts of workers the opportunity to walk out. 




 Ever read the 'Book of Revelation' ? A lot of people in the first two centuries CE believed that it was indeed a travel guide rather than poetry, and they also took the "this generation will not pass away until all things are accomplished" bit elsewhere quite literally.

So...in the interim while waiting for the seven angels, seven trumpets and seven seals and all the other sevens there are other things to do. Think about it. 




 On occasion their falsehoods actually cross the line into real criminal libel. 




 I see the article mentions farmworkers and domestic care workers as being left out. There is another category, that of workers in industries where tips are a practice. Most of this is the restaurant industry, but I'm sure they may be others. 




 Support. This will be nothing if not interesting. But you know Post, in the end you're going to regret this. It will only be fun for a short time. Think ahead, think ahead.

On a side note wasn't the r/postleftanarchism addition voted on months ago and had a yes ? 




 Busy, busy, busy Mr Rent Check ? Here's wishing you a fat old time. 




 Actually given the intellectual tools he had he did a fairly good job. A few things should be noted. The first is that his book wasn't just about the fate of state socialist societies. Burnham, like others at the time, saw fascism and American-style corporatism as equally roads that were leading to a 'new mode of production' (Marxist category) with the managers replacing the capitalists as the ruling class.

The second thing to note is that this was a dispute that did indeed begin amongst Trotskyists. There were basically three positions vis-a-vis the so-called 'socialist states'. The orthodox one is the 'deformed workers' state' which saw nothing wrong with a system of nationalized industry and said that the 'proletariat' could exercise ultimate control over such an economy via its political organization(s). The second was the 'state capitalism' position which tried to describe the 'socialist' states as merely another form of capitalism which the workers couldn't control with minor reforms. The final position, Burnham's one, was what is called 'bureaucratic collectivism' which said, as mentioned above, that the managers were a new ruling class and the economies they controlled were fundamentally different from capitalism.

The 'bureaucratic collectivism' position is inherently unstable. It is often a stop-over point to a final destination on either the right, like Burnham, or to the left as in council communism. The internal operations of a Leninist party are simply too obvious and easy to describe as such a new class in embryo to lead to an 'enduring marriage'.

Another thing to be considered is that writers on the 'New Class' seem to be almost always blind to either writers who commented on the subject before. You will find no mention in Burnham of Jan Waclaw Machjiaski and the 'Workers' Conspiracy', despite the fact that this group was well known amongst the Russian revolutionaries. Neither will you find any credit being given to a number of fairly unradical orthodox economists such as Berle and Means who described the process of 'managerialization' in Western 'capitalism' before he did.

Going forward you will find ex-communist dissidents such as Milovan Djilas who wrote his 'The New Class' focused only on East Bloc (and his native Yugoslavia of which he was once vice-president) with no reference to either fascism nor Western corporate structure. This tradition of not giving credit continues today in the writings of the advocates of Parecon who never note the ancestry of their 'coordinator class'. 

Burnham's central idea was hardly his alone, and like all the many others who have written on the subject he would have laughed at the idea that the trends he was describing were due to some subjective conscious "wanting" on the part of the socialists. At the time he wrote he was still a good enough Marxist to bring old Karl's opinion on subjective desires and social change to bear on such an opinion. If a landslide in in process it doesn't matter what the boulders want.

I could say more, but deviating a bit from the subject you will find the essence of Burnham's position described quite well in "The Book" supposedly written by the dissident Goldstein in Orwell's 1984. 




 Yes true. That's a possible explanation as well. 




 My cynical mind comes up with the idea that some people are only happy when they are fighting. 




 mBio is the journal of the American Society for Microbiology which, according to their self-description has 30,000 members. You may wish to investigate their organization before any further comments. The point you raise about 'detergents' may be well taken given other information about such things as a pathway to resistance via active export of antimicrobials being promoted due to 'hand sanitizers' in common use. Perhaps you might want to write the journal about your concerns but please remember the following:

*If certain products are 'always' combinations of certain ingredients and if the products in question lead to certain results one might argue about 'which' ingredient is the culprit, but one cannot argue that the effect is not produced unless, of course, the research fails to be replicated.* 




 The best place to begin is with [Le Monde Libertaire](http://www.monde-libertaire.fr). It's the press organ of the FA (Fdration anarchiste the major grouping of French-speaking anarchists in France, Belgium and Switzerland). Look back to the January issue for the FA's statement and follow the news items for further developments. The anarchosyndicalist CNT-f (Vignolles) and other groups not affiliated to the FA spoke in the same manner.

In Spain the anarchist groups and unions reacted in the same manner. This included the CNT, the CGT, Solidaridad Obrera and the FAI. The most 'heated' item I read was in the pages of Umanita Nova, the organ of the Italian FAI (the *real* one not the shady one).Unfortunately I had to use Google Translate on this, but the blood and thunder came through nonetheless. Nobody can beat the Italians for shear high emotion hatred of religion.

You might also want to look at the website of the [International of Anarchist-Federations](http://i-a-f.org) for links to other groups. I can look up further French links for you if you like.

All the statements and reporting are of a type. They include:

-Clear condemnations of the Charlie Hebdo murderers with *no* hedging or hinting about how somehow the victims "deserved it" because they weren't up to 'anti-isms' of American ~~psychology cult~~ leftism.

-A clear and undisguised statement about how such murderous acts serve the interests of the state and the right by providing justification for further repression.

-A clear explanation of why the anarchists don't wish to participate in many of the 'Je suis Charlie' events because of the use that the state makes of these and the presence of some *very* unsavoury groups in the lineup of these events.

-Warnings of the backlash against European Muslims and statements of solidarity *with the very important provisio that the anarchists will not cease anti-religious propaganda* in relation to Islam and other religions. Nor will they associate with extreme theocratic groups under some pretense of 'solidarity'.

-Statements about the role of Western imperialism in Muslim countries *without trying to lay all the blame on this factor*.

So have a look. In the anglosphere 'PCism' is not the exclusive possession of the anarchists. It infects most of the left to one degree or another, especially in the USA. It's not an affliction that is shared by many in the rest of the world. 




 Don't forget omega191, the banned account from which the person in question snuck back as volcanoclosto. 




 Well at least for pharmaceutical companies. 




 Oppose. Accusations of say 'pedophilia' and rape threats are, of course, serious matters that happen to cross the line into criminal libel if unsubstantiated. Hmmmm. Accusations of doxxing aren't considered an offense outside of reddit where it is the doxxing itself that is considered serious.

In all cases the claims must be substantiated, and truth is a defense. The last item, however, is far more serious than anything covered in internet rules or in the criminal law. To disprove the accusation a person would have to provide evidence that it *isn't* true. In any case being volc is about the worst insult anybody could utter.  




 It really depends on the character of the recipient.  




 The first thing that comes to my mind is that the whole effect could possibly be explained by the idea that the rats became 'laid back'. That is they were putting less stress on the bone to be healed. 




 Thank you. I had a look at the item, and it seems that the lobbying on the part of industry has only been minimally successful. The lobby's target is the Black Congressional Caucus, and they will, of course, look at the matter from the point of view of their interest group. The most likely outcome is likely to be that black legislators will be 'on side' with solar providing it can be demonstrated that the interests of black people are properly protected.

The question is much bigger 'out on the rez', and the general consensus of First Nations is that solar energy is very much in their interests. In many cases the cost advantage of solar is even greater for native communities because of the cost of power transmission to isolated communities. There are cases where native groups oppose certain projects, but they are outweighed by the far more numerous cases where tribes are developing their own solar resources.

I'm not surprised that industry lobbyists will lobby who and where they can. While their arguments are not as dramatically ridiculous as they are in the case of reservations I personally think that the final conclusion of the debate will be that solar energy is of net benefit to black communities as well.

In any case it's very interesting, and I thank you once more for pointing out something that my weak old eyes missed. Gotta get those peepers checked. 




 If you read any of the Latin languages such as French, Spanish or Italian you can see a vast gulf between the anarchist opinion on the continent and the PC reflex so prevalent in the English language press/web. Anarchism is a well thought out tradition in such places, not dominated by the academy and 'professional leftists'. 




 I've gone through the article twice, and I can't find any mention of "race". The "poor" are mentioned briefly. What part of the article are you speaking of ? 




 *Leaving Fantasy Island*

The reason God gave you fingers is so that you could count. I know you'd *like* it to be that min_thamee was banned "4-5 times in the past year", but that's pure imagination. Here's the reality.

On January 29, 2014 min_thamee was banned unilaterally by emma____ when he had the user name of alookyaw. He returned under the new name of min_dami, and eventually he fessed up and asked to be unbanned. This was approved by a majority. The request was made on July 10, 2014. On October 22, 2014 a ban was proposed, relying on obviously false information, and it was carried.

OK, take out those fingers. "*In the last year*" alookya/min_dami/min_thamee was banned a grand total of **one** time. Go back to the textbook, and look it up. Funny thing, *one* is **not** equal to *4-5*. Even if one were to grant that a 'year' is a 'social construction' and has 14 months rather than 12, *two* is still not equal to *4-5*.

The only way you can reach 4-5 is to include the 3 (I think) times somebody posted on meta *complaining* that min_dami hadn't been banned.

As to the three accounts matter the first change is explained above. The second was **publically** announced when min_thamee was under the mistaken impression that changing the account name would lead to a lessening of some of the pressure on him. No such luck. Not a snowball's chance in hell. Still - no sneakiness involved as is plainly shown by the record. 




 My mistake. "W"s don't do well on my keyboard. Good catch. Actually if you think of the utilities as pirates it makes perfect sense. :) 




 Just fyi the user in question is 'the man of a thousand faces' aka jaki/stirner/crabs/syndicate_V/ CGU_Bad_For_Business,  etc., etc., etc.. Good old Mr. Rentcheck has been banned more times, under more names, than you have fingers - in a single year. If you want a permanent ban it's already in place many, many times. Good luck. 
























 "My name is Barack Obama, and I approve these shoes" ? 




 Municipal workers. One of the main grievances is that the municipality arranges to employ people part-time so as to avoid benefits due to full time workers. 




 I've seen some, mostly on the CGT's website but also on that of the CNT I believe. All were solely in Spanish. 




 I've said this before elsewhere. It's the NITPIMBY phenomena -Not In The Pool In My Back Yard. 




 Probably very far indeed. The authors found that there are multiple alleles for the gene coding hyaluronan even amongst the naked mole-rat's closer relatives. The one amino acid substitution un ique to this animal may not work at all in an organism far from the clade like humans because multiple substitutions may be necessary. 




 Living Utopia is a great documentary. There are some other documentaries on the Spanish anarchists and the Civil War, but this is the only one which, to my knowledge, has the English subtitles. Others are only in Spanish. Am I wrong ? Are there others ? 




 Seems like a worthy project. I see you're already a member of the US Federation of Worker Co-ops. You might be interested in the r/economicdemocracy subreddit. Also if you haven't already do look at the [1worker1vote](http://1orker1vote.org) website for an example of another ongoing project. Also have a look at the [IWW](http://www.iww.org) website and see if you might want to sign up. 




 NITPIMBY - Not in the pool in my back yard. 




 That's a thought actually. 




 Terse and very much to the point. 




 You're welcome. 




 That may be true.

Durante la intervencin militar rusa en Crimea, Alexandr Koltchenko organiz manifestaciones pacficas de protesta contra la ocupacin militar, que false el referndum, al lado de ciudadanxs ttarxs, ucranianxs o rusxs. Algunos das antes de una de estas manifestaciones, la polica poltica rusa (FSB) secuestr a varios organizadores de estas resistencias populares; fue el caso de A. Kolchenko, le 16 de mayo de 2014.

Con otras tres personas secuestradas as, se le acus en particular  de organizacin de un grupo terrorista relacionado con la ultraderecha ucraniana . De ah una serie de acusaciones delirantes: a Kolchenko se le acusa de haber planificado explosiones cerca de la estatua de Lenin en Simferpol los 8 y 9 de mayo, saboteado lneas de ferrocarriles y elctricas, intentado incendiar locales de la Unidad Rusa y de la Comunidad rusa de Crimea el 14 de abril, y los de Rusia Unida el 18 de abril!

Alexandr Koltchenko es un antifascista que la polica poltica trata de hacer pasar por un fascista.

Alexandr Kolchenko es un hombre que se considera comme ciudadano ucraniano y que la polica poltica rusa quiere juzgar en tanto que ruso. Est encerrado en condiciones drsticas, sus abogados estn privados de los derechos elementales de una defensa digna de este nombre y el est bajo la amenaza de 15 a 20 aos de campo de trabajo.

A. Kolchenko es estudiante y militante sindical; tambin trabajaba de cartero, en paralelo con sus estudios. Defiende activamente, con su prctica, el derecho de organizarse libremente, ee derecho de crear y animar organizaciones asociativas, sindicales, ecologistas o polticas.

Forma parte de los hombres y mujeres que luchan contra la extrema derecha, que sea ucraniana, rusa u otra.

Puesto que est luchando contra la corrupcin y por la igualdad de derechos entre todxs, A. Koltchenko es el blanco de los clanes oligrquicos en Rusia y Ucrania.

A. Kolchenko milita por el derecho de cada pueblo a decidir de su propio porvenir.

La situacin de A. Kolchenko es emblemtica de la represin ejercida en esta regin del mundo. Pero su caso dista mucho de ser el nico. A travs de A. Kolchenko, sont las libertades democrticas de todxs las que defendemos. Nuestra actuacin, como la A. Kolchenko, se opone a quienes desean menguar dichas libertades.

Por la liberacin inmediata de Alexandr Kolchenko y por las libertades democrticas en todos los pases, nuestras organizaciones asociativas, sindicales y polticas piden, con motivo del Uno de mayo, la ampliacin de la solidaridad internacional con el fin de denunciar el secuestro y la detencin de A. Kolchenko por les autoridades rusas (que decidirn la fecha de su juicio a principio del mes de mayo), exigir sa liberacin inmediata, y para que el Gobierno ucraniano reivindique explcitamente la liberacin de Alexandr Kolchenko.

Despus de la semana de accin de inicios de abril (manifestaciones en Biarritz, Pars, Estrasburgo, Marsella Kiev, Minsk, Berln, Bremen y Tnez) lanzamos una suscripcin para financiar los gastos de justicia y auxiliar a los comits de apoyo para popularizar la campaa de solidaridad en Rusia y en Ucrania. Las ayudas se deben remitir a Solidaires Comit Kolchenko, 144, bd de la Villette, 75019 Pars.

 Erdogan doesn't *always* get his own way. 




 Well the wording of the law is probably just some 'tuck in' put in to satisfy someone in the process of drafting it who is unclear on the concept even though...get ready for it... it is *technically* possible. Let's go to mtf surgery first because it is the easiest case. What the surgeon can do is instead of removing the testicles is replace them in the inguinal area, preserve the vas deferens and reposition its outlet to a place in the new vagina. To my knowledge this has never been done. What it is is an artificial mimicking of cryptorchidism, undescended testicles, the most common birth defect involving the genitals (1 to 3% of regular births, up to 30% of premmies). One possible side effect would be *reduced* fertility, though this may not be complete. Up to 11% of retained testicles can still produce sperm. Another possibility is a higher risk of cancer in the repositioned testicles. Retained testicles have a significantly higher risk. I have no idea of what the risk would be in comparison to congenital cryptorchidism, and because it hasn't been done before nobody else does either. 

There are probably other things to consider that are outside my knowledge, but I can be fairly certain that *no* legislator knows even the little I have described above. The result would be a physiologically fertile male with none of the genitalia involved in actual sex-related fertilization. I suppose any sperm produced could possibly be harvested and used for AI. Boy would that be a good one for a hospital ethics committee.

Just last year the first reported uterine/ovarian transplants were done in Sweden. These were, of course, done on females. How this will work out in terms of tolerance and fertility I don't know, and once more I'm fairly confident that *nobody* knows. Can rejection be managed without enough deleterious side effects so that a normal pregnancy can happen ? Time will tell. Transplant medicine has certainly made major advances over the years, but this is an 'edge of the universe' surgery. Who knows. As to creating a normal and functional birth canal along with this, well the surgeon that could do this would be in line for divinity. This news is also probably unknown (or forgotten) to almost every legislator in the world though it was given a certain amount of publicity.

As to ftm surgery there would be an 'outside' chance that testicular transplants could also be possible though this also involves more than simply a 'new pair of nuts'. To my knowledge the only testicular 'transplants' that have been done are 'autologous' ie the tissue is from the patient's own body. This has been done for patients undergoing chemotherapy which will destroy fertility. Pre-chemo testicular tissue is harvested and later replaced post-chemo. Obviously this can't be done in mtf sex reassignment. There has to be a separate donor. Then there is the process involved in creating a *functional* system like the difficulty in creating a birth canal. The surgeon involved may not be eligible for godhood, but *would* be a candidate for canonization.

So, summing it up the procedures to retain fertility in sex reassignment surgeries are *possible* though fraught with difficulty. I doubt, however, that these details were known to the bureaucrats framing the legislation or legislators discussing it. So, I may be wrong, but I believe that the stipulation was placed in the bills out of pure confusion. 




 I wonder hat their annual production is. 




 I wonder who could have downvoted this and what their reason might be. My imagination says that it might indicate that if I die I might unexpectedly have "benefit of clergy". This canonization has long been a contentious one. The [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/22/us/to-some-indians-in-california-father-serra-is-far-from-a-saint.html?_r=0) and, [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/25/pope-francis-junipero-serra-sainthood-native-american-controversy) have covered it last January. Here's a couple of interesting facts:

1)The planned canonization of Serra is being announced *at the same time* as the US Senate is debating the removal of his statue from the National Statuary Hall on the Capital. The proposal moves to replace it with a statue of astronaut Sally Ride. 

2)The first 'miracle' which allowed Pope John Paul to beatify (elevate to the status of 'Blessed') was the supposedly 'authentic' cure of a nun with lupus in 1986. Now lupus is an 'interesting' disease. The prognosis very frequently involves a waxing and waning course including apparent spontaneous remissions. In other words this is a rather threadbare miracle. In any case he became "Blessed' in 1987.

3)There also a couple of other things that even the great majority of Catholics don't know. One is that the old rule that it took *two* authenticated miracles to go up the Sainthood ladder is being waived more and more. A lot of recent Saints owe their title to this change in practice. It seems that every advance in medical science leads there to be fewer and fewer good miracles to go around.

4) But there's still more that is also unknown to even the vast majority of Catholics. Remember the 'Devil's Advocate' (called the Advocatus Diabolicus by the Church ) ? 'Remember' is the proper word. No such thing anymore, for some time actually. This official of the 'Congregation for the Causes of Saints' was abolished in 1987 by then Pope John Paul II. The 'Saint Machine' has an easier and easier time of it these days.



3) 




 If you track through on the reference in Le Monde to the site of the National Assembly you get a complete vote total with abstentions. The three Front de Gauche members voted *pour/for* the bill. There were no abstentions from their caucus. There were a number of abstentions amongst the PS bloc. 




 Have they not 'failed' multiple times before ? 




 The Hubble Site may have more references on it. 




 I see. The data was gathered by a collaboration between the three different telescopes so I guess this is indeed 'different'. 




 I'm afraid that I have a hard time determining what the difference between the two would be. 




 That's interesting. I wonder what the percentages are. 




 Thanks. 




 Yes, Utah is not the only place where this model is being applied. It just happened to be in the news now. The difference is that a need is being met without assuming that you have to punish and 'correct' first. 




 'McCafe' ? Big in the cup but mostly foam ? 




 Yes, generally they are very young and un-experienced. It isn't just the mods. It's also the clique/cult in which they are situated. The life-stylism definitely yes. Their isolation and cliquishness shows over and over. The post-leftism less so - *except* there is a sort of 'alliance' going on. Post-leftists are allowed a lot of leeway that sensible people are not *provided that they make the properly politically correct noises* and especially join in the gang-ups. They are even allowed to make properly *abstract* criticisms of identity politics provided, of course that they remain abstract and don't interfere with the day-to-day application of PC witch hunting and that they join the mob when called. The two points of view are, of course, totally incompatible in reality, but in addition to ignorance about anarchism the clique/cult has an amazing ability to avoid coherent thought.

I've often struggled about how to describe the things I see there, and several uncomplimentary adjectives come to mind. Of course what they preach was pretty well unknown 20 years ago even if it as actually beginning then. Think the faction fights in Love and Rage. L   R had a deeper history. Go back further, say 40 to 45 years ago when I first became an anarchist. Yes, I'm an old fart. The division was even deeper then, but there was something happening then that is very similar to these people now. Think the Weatherman cult, as the New Left was disintegrating and some of it was sinking into the Maoist black hole. All the glorification of mindless violence. Up to and including hero worshipping the Charley Manson cult.The desperation of a declining movement that couldn't accept the fact. The reduction of politics to slogans and simplistic hatreds. The imaginary identification with a caricature of an 'oppressed' that in reality wants nothing to do with them. It's all there. I've seen this nasty mindlessness before, and it isn't pleasant to see it again.

But this is too long. Talk to you later. But yes, irony is well beyond  them. 




 Got it. 




 You mean that it has already been fading for a long time ? Or that it is too short a time to tell ? 




 Ah, but you have to take an actual numerical estimate, and then repeat it in other locations.  




 No, far from it. Lots of people besides that particular cult have a bone to pick with these actions. 




 Good question. I'll think about this and get back to you. 




 I never knew that. I only became interested in moderation at all, specifically in r/anarchism, about a year ago when I noticed an incredible amount of childish aggression and posturing and... went in search. 




 I guess that's within the realm of the possible. There has, however, been tension and disagreements between them before. 




 I'm fairly confident that that is true. 




 Yes, of course, free speech has been a cardinal point of doctrine amongst *the majority* of the anarchist movement since the 1800s. Whatever doubt there may have been was more than resolved by bitter experience, particularly the Russian Revolution but also the Spanish case. I think one of the keys to understanding the strange opinions of the cult/clique that runs r/anarchism is the fact that they know very little about anarchism. The level of ignorance there is truly amazing. I've seen more than one person try to point out the disconnect between what they believe (and unfortunately practice) and the anarchist tradition. Quite often these obvious facts are simply deleted. 

I am not as familiar with the situation in r/socialism, but I assume it is the same though less dramatic. Certainly less silly posturing about violence in imaginary internet worlds. But is this merely my lower familiarity rather than a real difference ? I don't know.  




 As I've said here before it's been years since I've eaten at McDonald's. One thing I remember though. The Big Mac was as likely as not to make me feel nauseous. I don't know why. Maybe the mayo ? I ended up sticking to the plain burger you mentioned. Now you tell me it's gone. Too bad. 




 I guess that's true in the case of a Commonwealth as opposed to a State 




 I haven't disgraced their doors for a long time, but I can certainly see your point. 




 Well, even though I don't agree with your politics I'm glad you are starting this alternative, and I wish you success. There has been at least one other alternative sub on the socialist side of things: r/socialistbeta  that was set up as a hopeful alternative to the generally low level of discussion on r/socialism. One of the big problems is that a crusade for purity naturally attracts the most aggressive characters, and these come to dominate the whole discussion. It also attracts those who, bluntly, *don't give a flying fuck about making the ideas popular but would rather construct an imaginary identity*. From that point of view driving people away very much serves their purpose. In the end the online 'community' comes to be representative not of the general run of the mill person who holds certain ideas but rather of a self selected 'elite' of the most aggressive.

The problem is, in fact, worse on the anarchist side of things, and there have been several attempts over the years at alternative subs that might 'tone up' the intelligence level and 'tone down' the triple distilled hatred. r/AnarchistNews is the most long lasting of these. I've recently started another, r/worldanarchism, which will hopefully concentrate on *non-American* news and views. The shared problem of both anarchists and socialists on reddit isn't even representative of the majority of American leftists, but it is certainly more concentrated in the USA than anywhere else. 

That's all. Good luck. 




 Picture Obama coming ashore wearing a sombrero. 




 I don't think this is universally true, and it certainly is a lot better than in the USA. 




 Most of the people I have known over time who have been 'on call' have been relatively well paid (railroad, medical, seasonal 'emergency', etc..). It can be nerve wracking even if you're paid well, and indeed on call for low wages is an atrocity. 




 I want to thank you immensely for your contribution here. I was thinking of trying to answer some of the assertions myself, but I obviously would have had to do a lot of research to find the facts that are at your fingertips. This is greatly appreciated.  




 Says the fool who doesn't know anything about hat he yells at. I do know quite a bit about the legacy of Stalinism, more than a rhetoric spouting idiot who lumps everything he hates together and has no concept of actual history. What I do know is that good fanatics like yourself are the willing tools of every dictatorial regime. Try to know something about what you pontificate on next time. 




 One can only hope that the US intelligence agents responsible will also be brought to justice. 




 I guess it's a  temporal wormhole from Newton to Einstein, but, what the heck, facts can get in the way of many good stories. Honestly I had a hard time even understanding some of the comments. Information is indeed irretrievably lost, and that string proves it.  




 Yes, it does. The authors found that oxytocin receptors occurred on both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. They were also quite explicit that their discovery of the lateralization to the left auditory cortex was quite important as well. What they didn't make plain, in my opinion, was whether the receptors on the inhibitory neurons 'tuned down' previously existing inhibition of that brain area due to said neurons or whether the inhibitory neurons were stimulated to inhibit *other* neurons that 'tuned down' a prior response to excitatory impulses. 




 I never looked at them. Let's see.

EDIT: I looked, and I see what you mean. It starts with 'white holes' and goes downhill from there. Actually a few of the comments were sensible, but many went into the zone of not even being wrong. 




 Oh Jesus H. Christ. My first honest-to-God serious right winger on this subreddit. Oh boy, oh boy, oh, boy. Please step towards that vat of liquid amber over there. I want to treasure this moment and preserve it for posterity.

In any case this reinforces my decision to try and concentrate this subreddit on *non-American* anarchist news. You may not be an anarchist, but you sure as hell are an American. The USA is the only country in the world, to my knowledge, where ignorance amongst a large fraction of the population (on both the left and the right) is considered a virtue. For the *majority* of Americans, however, and the overwhelming majority of the rest of the world "larnin'" as my old man would have said is a *good* thing.

In any case I'd rather talk to the original poster, but I'll kindly provide a few facts of life to brighten up your dismal world. There is such a thing as 'Marxism-Leninism' which is the *actual* meaning of the word 'communist' when it is used in everyday talk. This thing is *not* the same as the economic system of 'communism' which may or may not be achievable. Marxist-Leninists do indeed aim at dictatorship, but *so do numerous dictatorships, actual and potential, supported by the USA across the world*. There is a big world of political differences outside of crude right wing American rhetoric that said rhetoric tries, sometimes desperately, to ignore. 

Some anarchists may be, shall we say, 'dodgy', but the majority of the movement across the world has *never* advocated dictatorship of *any* sort. It's actually the *exact* opposite of that. If you wish to pontificate on 'anarchism' I'd suggest you find out what it actually is first. 

As for the original poster I will be asking questions of them and talking to them soon. The point that you should know, assuming you are interested in learning anything at all, is that their ideology, so-called 'African socialism' is not, not, not the same thing as communism/Marxism-Leninism. It has resulted in dictatorship in some places in the past, but these regimes have not shared the totalitarian ambitions of Marxist-Leninists. I disagree with that ideology, but your tiny world view blinds you to what it actually is.

 




 No problem. I am just being neurotic. 




 Oops. I will delete and repost. 




 That's an unsettling thought isn't it. 




 I think the author actually agrees with you. What he is doing is posing a question of how information/resources could be exchanged between components of the 'new economy' while maintaining its democratic nature. Is this an easy question ? No, and you pose one of the problems. What I would say is 'keep the risks small'. It's a matter of future discussion. 




 It's meant to be. 




 Yes, it does. It's a sudden burst of color seen at sunset if conditions are right. 




 I suspect that Cheney more or less likes his family.  




 I think that there are two different conceptions of both morality and free will operating here. From what you say the 'free choice' of an agent in a situation of incomplete information is, to Harris, the be all and end all of the morality of said choice with no reference to consequences. I think Chomsky is alluding to the way in which self deception (which he and Robert Trivers have discussed) plays a role in grading the morality of a choice. The information available to a free agent can be *deliberately* incomplete because of a prior decision to avoid certain information. I don't think Chomsky makes this plain, but it seems to be a factor to me. In this case the 'negligence' is deliberate and the 'severity' could have been predicted by information that the agent avoids.

OK, that's all the philosophy that I'm going to do today. 




 The world always holds surprises. It depends every much on how much pressure the USA decides to apply and *also* on what credibility their pressure has in Ecuador today. In Ecuador itself the issue is a 'cross-class' one gaining support from a number of sectors of the population. 




 I'm not that familiar with Harris. Does he make his money by 'punditry' ? 




 Yes, that's probably a valid criticism. 




 Thanks. I forgot about that detail. 




 Are the Libertarians in power in *any* of the US States where marijuana has been decriminalized ? Never say never. It took a right wing Administration to end the Vietnam War and to open up to China. The world is complicated. 




 A few probably have, but an even rarer event is that they have had relatives or friends who have gone to prison because of drugs and either die there or die later when they come out worse than before.  




 I'd guess that the only convictions that would be affected would be in Ecuador itself. 




 Thank you for the information. Can you expand on this ? 




 That isn't hat happens in the real world as European experience has demonstrated. 




 You do realize that meth is pretty well a 100% domestic product. 




 I don't know the full details of the legislation. On a local level probably 'yes'. Export ? 




 Which is spent on military expeditions targeting the peasants. That's the reality, and peasants in the Andes know this very well. 




 A few lesser known historical facts should be brought up here. The first was that father Gapon was a paid agent of the Okhrana, the Tsarist secret police. This was part and parcel of the Okhrana's policy of 'police unionism'. It obviously didn't work out very well. It was, of course, from a police point of view not the *greatest* failure. Looking at it from 'over there' precipitating a revolution was less of an 'oops' than having your agents kill government ministers and even the Tsar's uncle. Oops !

Time ran on and the SRs found out that Gapon was a police agent. A group was sent to kill him, commanded by one 'Azef'. The task was completed in 1906. It took three years for Vladimir Burtzev (yay !) to gather enough evidence to show that Azef himself was an Okhrana agent. Azef managed to escape from France where he was operating at the time due to the fact that the 'trial judges' (mostly SRs but including Kropotkin) were *very* much opposed to Burtzev's claim. It's a long story, but Burtzev had to bring forward the fact that he had corrupted a police officer who passed the info on.

While the idiots forced the delay, demanding that Burtzev "kill himself", Azef made his escape to Germany. Burtzev was pissed. He had to reveal one of his most valuable sources. Kropotkin was on the tribunal, but he wasn't as aggressive as the SR judges. Later K expressed his great gratitude for Burtzev's work. Which all goes to show that the worst people in the world to be judges on a tribunal are Russians. But more seriously it shows what happens when the romance of conspiracy overcomes common sense. Looking at it from the other side it's a great demonstration of how the best laid plans can blow up in your face. 




 Don't forget to factor in airfare and hotel in a projected budget. And, of course, bribes. Lots of bribes. 




 I don't think 'bathsalts' are a big thing in Ecuador. 




 No, it appears to be all drugs. Don't forget that Ecuador has been the victim of the US war on ~~drugs~~ peasants for decades now. Think cocaine, a dirt poor peasant and a US piloted plane passing overhead. If the peasant is lucky and he has paid the proper bribes he might not just live but even keep his crops. 




 I'm not too sure. I haven't seen any numbers, but if European experience is anything to judge by they will indeed decrease. 




 One can only hope that the US pressure will decrease for one reason or the other. 




 Muy bueno por Ecuador. 




 Thanks for the info. 




 I may be wrong on this, but I believe Uruguay legalized only marijuana. I understand that Portugal has legalized 'possession' of any drug across the board.  




 I believe that the use of a pesticide has to be approved in a 'crop by crop' manner. No doubt what you are saying about tobacco is correct, but this is a matter of regulation and bureaucratic rules.  




 I guess you're right on that. Good point. 




 For an introduction to the anarchist side of things see [An Anarchist FAQ](http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/index.html) . 




 Thanks. I was going on only the trail from the Physics World article. 




 No connection to the UAW that I know of. The [federation/alliance](http://www.industriall-union.org) was founded in June 2012 by four international unions. Since then it has grown a lot. In the USA the USW are an affiliate. The USW have been doing a few international things in the last few years. Aside from IndustriALL they are a component of Workers Uniting along with British unions. They are also allied with the Mondragon federation in the [1worker1vote](http://1worker1vote.org) organization to promote workers' cooperatives.  




 Yes, that can be the best thing to do in some cases. I often do that, but in this case the original paper is behind a paywall. I use the original when the full paper is open source. Otherwise I tend to stick to the title in the secondary source, in this case Physics World. 




 ??? 




 It all comes down to who gets to define what the "foundations of Islam" are.  




 Yes, I'm sure the pictures will become more and more informative as the craft gets closer to Pluto. 




 Here are three good books that can help you out and direct you an endless wealth of other sources:

1)The first three volumes of E.H. Carr's 14 volume history of the Soviet Union. These deal with the period you are interested in, and Carr regularly devotes a section on finance within each time period he is describing. Impeccably researched and documented.

2)Alex Nove's 'An Economic History of the USSR'. A less enjoyable read than Carr mostly because of a narrower focus, but in some ways more detailed and useful than Carr.*IMPORTANT POINT - I checked, and to my amazement the book is available on the internet at Google Books.* Carr's history would be available at University libraries, but only the best would have all 14 volumes.

3)Samuel Farber's 'Before Stalinism: The Rise and Fall of Soviet Democracy'. Well written but has less about your particular interest than the other two. Written from a non-Leninist Marxist point of view, and the author's main concern is political ie how Soviet democracy could have been preserved if various factions had made the right choices. 




 There's cold, and then there's *really* cold. It does make me wonder, however, what they could be made of. 




 This is a really good presentation. Thanks. 




 Maintenance in Antarctic conditions must be quite the feat as well. 




 Or whoever owns that robot. 




 From the point of view of the business owners it's the furthest thing from a 'failure'. 




 Those are interesting numbers. 




 It could also fit in as a measure of how many jobs have been lost in some situations. 




 Yes, but in pretty well every existing society things like 'comfort', 'time' and *opportunity* 'to pursue more interesting activities' are as unequally distributed as economic resources are. In fact they are often very much the same thing. OK, that's *now*. Should technological advances destroy jobs history is pretty clear on what happens. Opportunities are *not* equally distributed, and the benefit of the technology goes to a few while for others they get nothing or their situation deteriorates. 

In no way does this mean that technological advance should be stopped; it's just that it has to be looked at in its context, both historical, economic and social. 




 In one way it was a British equivalent of continental anarchosyndicalism. It believed that the economy should be democratically controlled by 'guilds' that were both a throwback to medieval guilds and also the equivalent of continental syndicates. It differed from continental anarchosyndicalism in several ways. One is that it saw a continued need for a state, for government. Another difference is that it was thoroughly non-revolutionary, advocating a gradual transition to a democratic society facilitated by elected politicians. Finally it was never a mass movement like continental anarchosyndicalism was. Continental anarchosyndicalism was perhaps the most authentically 'proletarian' movement that history has ever produced. British Guild Socialism in contrast was more of an intellectual movement even though it had its sympathizers amongst the working class. The guild socialists relied much more on 'converting people of good will' than on anything resembling the union organization of continental anarchosyndicalism. 




 All that I can say to that is that it takes a great deal of semi-religious faith to assign the word 'smart' to a phone. Maybe some people have truly genius rocks in their back yard. But yes, I know people are easily indoctrinated, but this weakness isn't infinite.  




 As an older person I can say that people of my generation would find that 'repulsive'. Interacting with the waiter(ess) is one of the pleasures of dining out. I hope that younger people will also feel that this is taking robotic impersonality to a ridiculous level. 




 I see. Various articles on different subjects on Wikipedia have different styles. It is, after all, user generated. I've never really thought much about the different writing styles there. 




 What are you referring to ? I can see a few grammar quibbles . For instance the "however" in the third sentence shouldn't lead off the sentence. The "-" in the second sentence would traditionally have been a semicolon. I must admit, however, that I also use "-" or a full colon instead of the correct semicolon. In the third sentence the more common term is "wholefoods" rather than "wholefood", but the second is probably acceptable. In sentence 3 there should be a comma in front of the "and". In the last sentence I personally would have left out the comma after the date, but I *think* this is still acceptable. It also is unclear because the author left out what the "170" modifies. Once more, however, the meaning is clear even if clumsy. 

You are probably referring to something more than this as being "weird", but I am uncertain what you are speaking of. 




 As the Luddites realized long ago. 




 In terms of the historical roots (French mutualism which created France's labor movement and later anarchosyndicalism and even the American individualist anarchists such as Tucker, Spooner, Labadie, etc.) it is obviously a 'socialism'. If you want to look at mutualists who self-define as socialists they put forward their own point of view in places like C4SS (Center for a stateless society). 




 Most of the research done has been trying to dice out certain factors from a complex situation. Very few real life situations are simple one factor changes. When the research is done, with the aid of truly heroic statistics, the most outstanding factor that regularly comes up is simple demographics. The higher the percentage of males from say 18 to 25 in the population the higher the crime rate.

New York would be an interesting study because it did indeed have a reduction in crime during a certain period. Those who wish to increase budgets say that this was due to the 'no-tolerance', 'broken window' policy put in place by the Major of the time. The reality is that there are *many* contributing factors, and the best that can be done is to assign a percentage with uncertainty to each factor. One of the biggest problem I can see with New York is choosing an appropriate control ie a comparable city. Most of the research that has been done takes national rates as a control, and that has difficulties. 




 To paraphrase Orwell, "some opportunities are more equal than others". 




 Oh no. I assume the coloring book comes with its on supply of disappearing ink in all the colors. 




 Well done. I like your comeback. The physician involved must have been really old fashioned. 




 I'm afraid that the selling price is unknown at this time. 




 Gracias compaero zeabu.  En beneficio de las victimas del sistema excolar Americano proporciono un resumen Ingls. Los EE.UU es el major ejamlo de un pais de habla Ingls que Deben saber Espaol.Pero la ignorancia es el objetivo de las escuelas Americanos.

Pot favor me corrija si usted piensa mi resumen es incorrecto. La filosofa no es mi puento fuerta.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

A summary of the article  above appears below. I don't have the time for a full translation at this moment. 

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

This article is from the Spanish language 'Philosophy Web', and it deals with a subject that actually may be more relevant in  English speaking countries, especially the USA, than it is in Spain or Latin America. The basic argument is against philosophical relativism. The most outstanding example of this is 'post modernism' in the USA which is being exported along with other industrial waste to the rest of the world. I will try in this summary to bracket my own opinions with an '[]', but I am sure that such may leak through to the summary. 

The title of the article translates as "I don't give a shit for your opinion'. It discusses a linguistic divide between opinion and its increasing promotion as opposed to 'fact'. [This is quite relevant in the present situation where 'post-modernism' holds sway in the university classrooms of soon to be retired (I hope)  American academics. This intellectual fad has spread outside of the USA. Hence this article from Spain. It also reminds me, to my discomfort, of the predictions of Russian sociologist Pitirim Sorokin who predicted an oncoming 'Age of Belief' that would supersede  an "Age of Empiricism'. While not willing to buy into Sorokin's determinism this may be an apt description of what has been happening in some regards.]

The author begins by tracing two concepts back to their Greek words. These are 'doxa' which may translate as 'opinion', 'common sense' or 'uniformed observation'. The other pole is 'episteme' which may translate as 'science' or 'informed statement'. The difference is between 'appearance' and 'reality'.

The essay goes on to how informed views are being discredited in favor of 'opinion'/doxa. The first stage of this process is a [propaganda] effort to maintain that there is 'no difference' between the two ways of viewing the world. This advances into the idea that both ways are 'equal' and that the difference between the two is a  matter of 'taste'.

One of the most important aspects of 'science' is that it is being continually being refined. The author contrasts this to the situation of 'opinion' where there is no mechanism for improvement, and he/she goes on to describe a situation, that of a bank loan, of how the two ways of seeing produce different actions. [The 'opinion' option, of course, may lead to bankruptcy if the bank persists in its folly].

The essay goes on to discuss 'relativism' which in effect denies an external reality, saying that all opinions are equal. [This, of course, is the venerable argument in philosophy between idealism and materialism]. What the media do is present the "stupidity of eqidistance' [from reality], and it uses the example of evolution/creationism as an example. Two sides of an argument are presented outside of any connection to reality that could allow judgement. In this context the 'debates' become 'set-ups'. [Entertainment rather than information.].

The author goes on to express the opinion that such debates become merely 'quantitative'. Right and wrong no longer exist. Simple weight of 'opinion' becomes more important than any way of differentiating between different points of view.

In such a situation no 'consensus' in the sense of a melding of different points of view in a 'dialectical' (non-Marxist sense) is possible. All that happens is an 'exhibitionism' of opinions where opinions no loner require evidence.

[In sum, in the Burt 'opinion', the essay is one more criticism of relativism, and it has political ramifications. I obviously agree because I am at heart a realist.]
 




 Thanks for the contribution. I tend to get a lot of news from South Korea, mostly from union federations and, of course, Labour Start. Korean workers tend to be very militant, and personally I think it is very much connected to the 'patronage' system of South Korean business. Trustification there seems to make Japan look like a truly competitive free market. So many labor disputes in Korea become political disputes almost automatically because the lines of patronage extend into the state as well to a greater degree than in other countries.

To my great disappointment I have found little in terms of *present* contacts with Korean anarchists. It seems to be all history. When the Asian Anarchist Network was really and truly operating posts from Korea were few and far between as well. I don't know what the problem is. Perhaps a more pervasive repression in terms of cowing people not with legal penalties but rather with the 'promise' of perpetual unemployment. But quite frankly I don't know. 




 Yeah, there are some of these do-gooder money machines that I have truly learned to hate over the years. PETA is one. Greenpeace (North American version) and Rainforest Action network are two others. Here's what happens. A local struggle begins. One of the leaches finds out about it. They sent a small contingent of travelling 'suckers' (or leftist bureaucrats on the make) to said locality and proceed to publicize the local struggle as a **fund raising opportunity** across the internet. The process actually predates the internet. Consider Newfoundland and the early NWT before Nunavut.  The people they send are 'weird' from the point of view of the locals *including the locals who started the campaign*. The invaders become a matter of embarrassment for local people, and, miracle of miracles, the whole community is united in hatred of the 'invaders'. Meanwhile the 'other side' uses the 'professional activists' as propaganda against their local opposition. Net result: five points down for the local opposition.

I'm most familiar with this in relation to Greenpeace. Their latest invasion involves a small community in Nunavut fighting against gas/oil exploration. I'm also quite familiar with the way that Rainforest Action Network parasitized the struggle of the Grassy Narrows people in Northwest Ontario. There are many other instances. I just tend to remember some.

PETA is in a class by itself. They can invade situations where there is no organized local struggle, appear, disappear and leave nothing but embarrassment and an increase in their bank account. They did this trick in Detroit during the water cut-off struggle. They parasitized a struggle that had nothing whatsoever to do with their supposed goals (besides making money of course). Besides embarrassing people in Detroit they contributed absolutely nothing, sweet bugger all, to the struggle to prevent the cut-offs.

OK enough emotion. It's not good for an old fart. I'm sure that there are other parasites besides the three I've mentioned above.  




 The subjective experience ? Yes, possibly. 




 Well I once more would say they are the same thing. As air molecules move past and touch the surface of the object some of the kinetic energy of the object is transferred to them as well. The difference between this and molecules directly in front of the object is that only part of the energy is transferred by the contact. 




 Oh God. A song with the lyrics "let the love flow" just popped into my mind.  




 They are sort of the same thing. Take the kinetic energy of the object just before it hits the air (assume a discrete boundary). As it descends it 'compresses' the air in front of it thereby changing kinetic energy into thermal energy of the air molecules. At the same time the air molecules exert an equal and opposite force on the object thereby slowing it down. This is the 'friction' referred to. The energy transferred to the air molecules is equal to that exerted on the object. 




 I'll try. As I said it may be dated. It's an idea that I've carried around in my head for over 25 years. 




 Good. Please do. 




 I guess that's true. It sure, however, has entered the language as a metaphor..."the road to Damascus". 




 Good question. Do spiders have the subjective experience of pain that we (and probably most vertebrates) have ? That's a bit beyond my knowledge. 




 Thanks. 




 There was at least one Greek philosopher who held to a sun centred cosmos. During the Renaissance Galileo escaped the death penalty. Copernicus escaped it by being dead already - his book was published posthumously. I think the heliocentric model was 'one' of the reasons why Giordano Bruno was killed, but I am not 100% sure on that. 




 China: 1)Incredible diversity, unappreciated by the outside world. 2)Oldest (more or less) continuous civilization. Stuff to see. 3)Rapidly changing and therefore interesting. 4)Soon to be the most important country in the world. 5)Interest in Pinyin (official national language). 6)Reportedly very hospitable country. 7)At least in the usual urban area I will personally be the biggest threat to the water quality. 




 Thank you. That seemed like a very informative article. 




 Yes, this guy wins some sort of 'nasty award'. 




 That's interesting. I'm going to have to try and compare them myself. 




 You're welcome. I've read several things over the years about 'muscle supplements' and liver failure, but I can't remember right now which compounds were involved. I'll have a look. Thanks for the comment. 




 You're probably right about that. 




 Thank you. 




 Thanks. 




 Yes, that's true. The thing is, however, that payment due is not an asset. When a private company declares bankruptcy the secured creditors will have their claims (payment due) compensated, at least in part, by funds raised by liquidation of the company's assets. Wages due (claims due) have a lesser priority than other debts do. I don't know how this works with a public entity such as a city. 




 Thanks for the information. I've actually given little thought to the subject of what influence small newspapers have. There are several in the city where I live, and I know that they are often good platforms for commercial advertising, and they may be useful for politicos as well. Thanks. It's food for thought. 




 Well, he's clear if nothing else. One thing I am unclear about in bankruptcy law. Secure creditors get first claim on assets, and wages owing are usually not in that category. I wonder how pension funds rank in the lineup. I imagine it is complicated. What assets do cities have that would be of any value to a pension fund ? 




 Well, there have been numerous epidemiological studies of the effects of economic conditions on mental health problems and yes, depression increases with decreased job security. There are also others studies, once more many, of the health effects of social class, including mental health. I'll see if I can dig up a good overview. 




 Will do. I've seen this sort of problem before, and usually is quite innocent as in somebody not properly undating (or adding) the security certificate for a site or a part of a site. Still, it's not always innocent. 




 I thank you profoundly for the great link. I was unaware of the Cornell project, and the site is fascinating. I signed up for some of the newsletters immediately. I see that their bird count (on May 9) is separate from the long running Christmas bird count. If you are connected to the project please note that when trying to access the count project from the link list at the bottom of the screen that it gives a 'security warning'. It is probably totally innocent, but I've learned to pay attention to these warnings and not proceed any further. Too bad. If you are not connected with Cornell please inform me, and I will try to email them myself about the problem. 




 Indeed. Humans as a group can be tremendously short-sighted. Sometimes it reaches the point of deliberate, malevolent attempts to retain ignorance. Think of politicians in the USA representing coastal communities and their attempts to deny climate change (South Carolina).

This incident also brought the 2009 Aquila earthquake to mind, and the court case that dragged on and on about it. I believe the accused involved have finally been vindicated. Earthquake prediction is a chancy affair, but sensible recommendations are often lost in bureaucracy. The circumstances are different, but there are relevant issues connecting both events (and other disasters). 




 That's been a long standing problem, and there have been numerous attempts to frame legislation to prevent it. None of these laws has yet solved the larger problem. Here's an interesting fact which may be dated but still has relevance. The side effects that you may see on labels, inserts and pharmacists' handouts are **95%** discovered via independent reporting by physicians, veterinarians, pharmacists, etc. The drug companies own reportage accounts for only one in twenty of the cautions. 




 It's interesting to think that the original objects were discovered and named by an amateur astronomer in a citizen science project. Not all science operates with huge budgets and bureaucracy. 




 From what I have read Muhammad was influenced by both Judaism and Christianity. I don't really know how much of each comes through in Islam. 




 Alternative futures. Would Islam have come into being without Christianity ? The classical Greco-Roman pantheon was pretty much past its best before date by the time Christianity rose to popularity. Would another of the mystery religions have served the same functions as Christianity ? 




 Thanks for the info. 




 Thank you. 




 Yes you are correct. I should have left the title alone rather than 'jazzing it up'. 




 No problem. It's something like hearing that 'Bill Jones' will be addressing the Chamber of Commerce annual meeting on the weekend. If you Google 'Bill Jones' you may find that a year ago he was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Then you look at the phone book to get a visual on the problem. 




 The report comes from the United States Geological Survey, an organization that I don't think anyone could accuse of being unscientific. 




 Two things you should pay attention to in the references you provided. One is the history of the Energy Foundation China. It seems that this organization founded in 1999 (16 years ago) seems credible to not just the Chinese government but also to several US foundations who fund it. Also have a close look at a photograph of one Eric Heinz receiving an award from the Chinese government, last September I believe. Study that photo.

Now go to the cv of M. Heinz (French extraction now doing a post-doc in Germany). Look at his photo. Different person. Now examine the cv that M. Heinz provides. There's a lot of things there. One is that, if I presume M. Heinz spent the usual 10 years in getting his PhD then he would have been all of 14 years old at the time when he was a 'founder' of the Foundation as claimed by the Foundation's website. Now look at the cv once more. M. Heinz is a *computer graphics* specialist with no connection to anything remotely connected to energy or conservation. There is also **no** mention of the Foundation and indeed no indication that he has ever set foot off the European continent.

How did you confuse these two utterly different people who just happen to share the same name ? 




 I highly recommend subscribing to that site. Some may find it too 'popular science', but in my opinion it sometimes can be as good as Scientific American. 




 Yes, that's a good and striking presentation. 




 The Longshoremen have long been one of the unions with the broadest world outlook, and this is true to the tradition. What I don't see, however, is the duration of the strike. One hour ? Three ? Eight ? A full 24 ? 




 I wonder if there is some pun hidden in the name La Gordissima and the El Gordo lottery ? 




 Young, fresh and full of new ideas. Isn't it true that the 'peak years' in many fields occur earlier than people might suspect ? 




 No disagreement, but the use of the word "dissipate" brought a smile to my face. 




 But that's a 'forecast' rather than a report. A graph there shows positive GDP growth in the first quarter - not 'outstanding' but at least positive. No doubt the 'recovery' wasn't all it was cracked out to be in many ways. I'll agree with you on that. 




 Thank you. I've started to go through the various links, and it will take me some time to put it all together in my mind. 




 That's an interesting and perhaps troubling point of view, and I'm going to have to look further at it. One minor thing though, not the central point of your comment. I disagree that reduction of carbon emissions automatically means lower economic growth - even though energy consumption per capita is often used as equivalent to GDP per capita. Take say an increase in the production of solar panels which (hopefully) leads to lower carbon emissions. This increase is in fact economic growth not its opposite. Take, for instance, the growth in electric vehicles which (again hopefully) leads to lower carbon emissions. This may be any of three options, growth, decreased growth or no effect. The list could go on and on. 




 That's unfortunately a problem with *all* research that is scientific in nature ie reports confidence levels. In reality there is always uncertainty. It isn't restricted to demographic estimates. You will see the same thing in such 'hard' subjects as physics. The 'weight' of the electron, the magnitude of the fine structure constant, the speed of light, and so on and so forth. All of these have the old 'plus or minus' a given number of standard deviations when they are reported. It's the uncertain nature of an uncertain world. 




 Even better. Without janitors they'll have to pick up after themselves. *A collective cheer comes up from the long-suffering mothers of politicians*. 




 I'll have to try and look that up. Thanks. 




 The article that I recently read (see previous comment) is 'Climate Change and the Permafrost Carbon Feedback', Nature April 9. I hope the following [link](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v520/n7546/full/nature14338.html) will take you to the open access article. I sometimes have a problem with articles from the Nature Group being visible to me (I'm a subscriber) but not to others. Get back to me if there is a problem with the link.

In any case the major thrust of the article is that their models say that the carbon release from permafrost will be slow and gradual rather than fast and precipitous. I hope so. 




 That's what some may say. That opinion becomes more and more common the higher up you go in the ruling class. What I find encouraging, however, is that China *is* changing. The feminists are joining labor, environmental, human rights and literary activists, and more news gets out than in years past. I try to take an optimistic view of it. 




 I think you're right about the first statement, but I'm not 100% sure. I know nothing about the unemployment rates at various times, but I would imagine that they would have been highest right after the American invasion. 




 Yes it would be a positive feedback situation indeed. I think the uncertainty relates to the speed of release. I was recently reading about how new research suggests that the release would be slower than once thought. I'll try to dig up that article. 




 Thank you for the information. To me it's fascinating that RNAs in general are now such a rich field of research and even therapy. 




 Oops. Almost forgot to mention that English demands that the first word of *every* sentence be capitalized, not one out of three. My excuse is that that is punctuation not grammar. I still get a good mark in grade 3 English composition. 




 Grammar notes:

1)When using an equational sentence do *not* use a noun as the subject and an adjective as the object unless you mean to say that the adjective is a characteristic of the subject. 'Equality' is correct. 'Egalitarian' is not. Add the 'ism' to the adjective 'egalitarian'.

2)The proper contraction of 'It is' is 'it's' not 'its'. Its is the possessive of the neuter pronoun it.

3)Remember that prepositions are often necessary to make a sentence intelligible. Put the preposition 'of' in front of the neologism 'masculism'. 

4)Remember that the verbal noun in English is formed from the adjective when it isn't formed from the verb itself. The proper verbal noun should be 'masculinism' rather than 'masculism' as the conversion of feminine to feminism demonstrates.

Yes, I *think* about it. I *think* that I am grateful that I'm not caught in a confused mind game of opposing one abstraction to another and thinking it means something. I'm grateful that I can look at actual empirical reality and use language for describing such and suggesting *real* changes rather than playing at philosophy. 




 Oh shit. I'm sorry. I forgot that whether a Nature publication article may be accessible to me as a subscriber it isn't necessarily so to others. Let's try the following: go to a popular science article in New Scientist (something like a British Scientific American) on this research. Use my posting history to find it if need be. See the article there that allows you to 'click through' to the article in Nature magazine. If you can't reach it that way please get back to me. I tend to alternate between laypersons' sources and the scientific literature itself depending on the character of the subreddit I am posting to. 




 It depends what you mean by "allowed". Am I going to interrupt taking a good shit when the 'Batsignal'  says an ancap has posted, run to the computer with my pants around my ankles, take an epileptic fit and ban some commentator because they are not 'pure' enough, yell a bunch of rhetoric that was old when I was young and feel self-satisfied that I have 'done something' ? No ! Obviously ! 

Why no ? It's far less to do with politics than with the fact that I was already a mature adult at the time when the average redditer's grandmothers gave birth to their parents. I have no illusions about the *grand importance* of the internet. I have no identity crisis to work out. I also have 'nothing to prove'. Adolescence  is long past. Quite frankly the competitions of various groups to attack and counterattack on the internet seems more than slightly childish to me. The ambition to be top gunslinger in an imaginary Dodge City has no attraction for me. 

I'm tempted to pull the 'non-American' card out of the deck. This sub will hopefully concentrate on the anarchist movement *beyond the borders of the United States* as was stated in the intro above. The so-called 'ancaps' are one of the 'deviations' (to use an old commie word) that are incredibly unimportant the further you get from the Red, White and Blue. See the 99% number mentioned above. Exclude strange American stuff and that basically takes care of the ancaps in their 99%. Along with things like Maoist political correctness disguised as anarchism, silly dreams about the end of civilization and, to a lesser extent, the making of terrorism out to be an 'ideology' (which, of course, has a large component of zombie Maoism to it as well). 

Personally the great majority of what I see from ancaps strikes me as a 'philosophy fad'. How many syllogisms can dance on the head of a pin. The American political equivalent of Thomist philosophy/theology. What is done is to take a few unexamined axioms and start deducing things *without any reference to the real world* - producing a *great ergo*. That's all fine and good for sophomore philosophy majors, but it is a howling emptiness out here. 

This wasn't always the case. Let's go back to those maternity days of redditers' grandmothers. Take the period 1968 to 1972 for example as the New Left was spiralling towards the Maoist snakepit. At that time people like Karl Hess, Jerome Tucille and even Murray Rothbard in one of his earlier disguises were all gung ho for a right-left alliance, and there were issues at the time that were opportune for such an alliance. Those issues are no longer of any great importance.

The players, however, were quite different. On the right the 'paleocons' were much more of a factor than they are now. Nowadays the religious right is an incredibly more important factor they were then. On the left, confused as it was, the 'New Left' was a *much* more important factor than American anarchism is today, not that American anarchism doesn't deserve the adjective 'confused' as well. Take a broad estimate of how 'popular' anarchism is in the USA today, including all variant definitions of it. Got a number ? Multiply that by another than ranges somewhere between 100 and 1,000. I have my own crude estimate which is about 1 in 7,000. So, for every vague anarchist today there would be between 70 and 700 vague New Leftists. It's a different world.

I have my own ideas of where this sub should go. Perhaps I didn't make them plain enough in the introduction beyond the fact that what anarchists are doing and thinking in other countries can stand as a corrective example to the problems of North American anarchism, bringing it 'back to its roots' as you will. 

Once more I run on at the mouth. I'll close with the fact that I recognize the *unimportance* of the ancaps and see little benefit in playing mudpie throw with them. Just like the fact that I think online diy pop psychotherapy disguised as 'anarchism' is ridiculous and is not any sort of 'anarchism' worth promoting. Similarly airy philosophy debates - the ancaps - are not a valuable use of time. 

To use a couple of old metaphors, one of which was probably not current amongst urban people when it was popular out in the boonies; "The 'usefulness' of some things that pass as 'anarchism' in today's USA makes tits on a boar look like a Swiss army knife. 




 Can you elaborate ? 




       ? Honest to Christ there is nothing about this to be concerned about. If this ever gets out of the house of wild dreams don't forget that it will be built  by the Russian government and Russian workers and then operated by Russians. Actually Russians are very nice people, and they can accomplish miracles - *providing nobody is foolish enough to plan the miracle*. If Stalin hadn't had a nervous breakdown when the Germans invaded the troops on the front would never have made the miraculous chaotic withdrawal they did, and Germany would have won WW2. To quote Chekov from Star Trek, "Russia inwented bullshit".  




 That happens to be the criteria that many anarchosyndicalist unions have adopted, and some such as the CNT-E made and make an effort to have as few paid staff as possible. That, however, seems to be something quite separate from the question of whether paid staff of *another* union can sign up in the IWW. The matter of staff salaries is something that has to be decided in said *other* union, not in another one such as the IWW that works on dual card principles. It's definitely a good recommendation for any union, but it is quite separate from the question of IWW membership. 

I doubt that any of the hugely overpaid executives of various business unions are panting at the door to take out IWW membership so the grossest possible example is moot. As to the lowly pen pushers, door knockers, flac runners, etc. it might be an idea to qualify their eligibility by income, but that becomes so complex that I don't think it is realistic. 




 Glad to have you onboard zeabu. Yes, it will be a great deal of work as I'm finding out, but I hope it will be worthwhile. You raised so many issues with your post, and I can't deal with all of them at once. Let's look at the first one you mentioned, the eternal and unrelenting posturing about violence towards the police in r/anarchism (and other places). It often seems like this is the *one and only* thing that ties the people that frequent such internet boards together. That and not saying 'bad words'. And, of course, a few other selected 'enemies'. All moral questions such as the compatibility of this sort of rhetoric with what anarchism is all about aside there are some practical problems with it that deserve attention.

Let's start with the aura of juvenile 'snottishness' that it casts on the movement. Most people reading such things would assume that the authors were either uncontrolled thugs - or much more likely - bratty 15 year olds showing off how rebellious they are. It creates a situation where the illusion of 'internet tough guy' becomes some sort of weird *principle*. It's mere showing off, and it paints anarchism as a phase of childish rebellion that people who become adults outgrow. Personally I want to present the ideology/ideals as a reasonable proposition that rational adults might want to consider. 

There's another observation that people may and possibly usually draw from seeing the high volume rhetoric. That is the pretentious show-off nature it presents. Fake, fake, fake and fake. That may be an even worse image to present than being thuggish. The violent claims are wildly out of touch with anything that is even remotely possible.

Police tasked with monitoring this sort of thing know that very well. If they were under some delusion that the nonsense was imminent and actually meant - well they would put a rapid end to it. It also, however, provides other benefits to those it is supposedly directed against.

First of all information gathering. It's very nice to have lists of people that *might* in some unlikely future actually pose some sort of threat. Such lists can be used should 'sting operations' be considered to produce a news story that can be 'evidence' of the need for increased surveillance budgets. It can also be used as part of evidence in court where the actual charges are considerably less than the wild internet fantasies. It can be further used as leverage for blackmail should a law enforcement agency wish to recruit informers for more in real life situations. Useful, useful, useful. One of the things I find almost amusing is that the rhetoric spouters often assume that they have some miraculous ways of hiding their real identities from surveillance. Really ! In their imagination they think they can play in a league that only other large governments can do.

The violent rhetoric provides a 'badge of identity' that some think can serve as 'proof' of their 'sincerity', 'commitment', 'bravery' or even in a bizarre inversion of reality as proof of 'advanced political ideas'. In actual fact it is an illusionary substitute for the real commitment of examining reality and trying to devise realistic ways of changing it. Put briefly, it prevents thought. In some cases thinking or learning are the exact opposite of what some people want to do.

Using violent rhetoric that is popular in certain small and shrinking subcultures easily becomes a way of avoiding learning about what a subject such as anarchism actually is and trying to imagine ways of making it realistic and workable, recognizing the problems with that. Anarchism is like any other human endeavor. It is incomplete and has difficulties. You may have noticed that many of the dogmatic guardians of the absolute truth of *their* version of anarchism actually know almost nothing about its reality, philosophical or historical. As long as shooting off one's mouth remains their major activity they never will learn much. 

This getting too long. One thing I'll close on. Hypocrisy is a character flaw that draws almost universal condemnation. It is emotional rather than rational, but the examples of long standing advocates of foolish actions who remain year after year, sometimes decade after decade, immune from the consequences of what they call *others to do* is disturbing. Having being an anarchist for decades I have had more than ample opportunity to observe such 'heroes'.  




 No problem. It certainly seemed related to genetics to me. 




 In the English language 'myth' can be used in a number of different ways, each of them with a set of different connotations. There are other words like this such as the word "theory". In the way the author uses the word it carries the connotation of 'wrong'. Others may use the word 'myth' in different ways such 'widely known story that gives meaning/justification to present social practices'. It may even mean a story that everyone knows is untrue but is widely known and appreciated because of some aesthetic appreciation. There are no doubt other usages that escape me at the moment.

The way the author uses the word is as follows. He takes Smith's speculations about a human propensity to specialize in the production of a certain item or services and says that Smith believed that this was a universal human characteristic. He then says that said products or services will naturally give rise to a 'market' where a surplus will be produced and said surplus will be exchanged for other items or services due to a 'human nature' that naturally gives rise to such a thing.

What the author is saying is that this anthropological speculation is taken as a axiom by most economists, an assumption that they do not question because it is 'self-evidently true'. The author further claims that the actual facts of anthropological study of various 'economies' do not support this axiom/myth/assumption. That is his argument. He makes the comparison to Sorel's idea of the 'myth of the general strike' that gave meaning to the activities of early syndicalists.

There are various points where one may argue with the author, but he does use the word in one of its accepted usages. 




 Time for a little geography lesson here. The article mentions a range of 7,000 km. Now suppose you put the fleet in the enclave of Kaliningrad, a crazy thing to do granted but not outside the range of possibilities for a Russian government of any sort. Now suppose there's big trouble on the Amur and Russia wants to airlift the troops to Vladivostok. They'll barely make it. St Petersburg to Vladivostok is about 6,000 km. They'll be running on vapour at the end. Suppose, on the other hand they want to face off Americans instead of Chinese. From Kaliningrad to the last Russian island in the Bering Sea is 9320 km. Well, they'll get past Lake Baikal, but somewhere over Yakutsk - down they go. If you go west instead of east the fleet would make Britain, but somewhere over the Atlantic....blub ! Could it reach Egypt ? Yes. South Africa ? I'd have to look.

"Anywhere in the world" is a gross overstatement. 




 Yes, the two exemptions have to be harmonized in some way. I think that the two clauses would be better than trying to fiddle with the unpaid or underpaid officials part. I haven't seen the part about the political party officers and officials. I'll try and find it. 




 I'm afraid that's easier said than done. 




 'Asshole', 'plumbing', 'bullshit': It all fits together. 




 The authors of the paper describe the implications of their work in veterinary and human medicine. Perhaps I made a poor job of saying that with my modification of the title. So I`ll expand. 

The authors looked at an uncommon inherited neurodegenerative disease in dogs. They traced this disease to a missense error in the ATG4D gene which encodes a protease involved in autophagy. They speculate that their work may point the way to investigation of inherited human neurodegenerative diseases of presently unknown etiology. They also speculate that their canine model may be useful in designing and testing therapy for such diseases if they are due to errors similar to that found in these dogs. It also has veterinary application. 

I hope this answers your question. 




 I see your point, and I remember that news now. I had instances in mind where the two unions were non-IWW. The Fieldworks situation isn't exactly one of another union though it certainly seems to be in the same category. In the old days we would have called Fieldworks a 'front' and that would be all that needed saying. In the days of highly developed NGOs and quangos perhaps there should be a neologism. Instead of 'quango' (quasi non-governmental organizations) perhaps 'quanuo' (quasi non-union organizations) would be appropriate. 

Yes, the matter *should* be discussed at the branch level and the HQ informed. Perhaps there should be some standard questions to be asked in such cases. I have no idea of how you'd word a proposal that didn't simply forbid such organization efforts. Obviously the initiative should still remain confidential rather than public. I also think there should be a similar if less strict process in the case of general 'lefty fronts' rather than specific 'union fronts'. Think Sisters Camelot.

Definitely worth paying attention to.  




 Yes, anarchists can be highly moralistic at times, and the article perhaps dwelt on that. But as to your major point there have been many instances that I've seen where the staff of a union is represented by a totally different union, and labor disputes have occurred. I never dreamt I should keep count of such things over the years, but I am certain that I have seen more than 10. It's not like electing an atheist Pope. Personally I think the 'staff exemption' (unless a person is involved in hiring or firing ie is a manager) as it presently is should stand. It might be a missed opportunity at some time in the future. I'm undecided about your second point which, of course, follows from the first. Staffers are obviously the recipients of 'pay', substantial or otherwise.

Food for thought anyways. I'll try and get back to you on this. 




 No, I was just joking using cat breeds. I could have included Scottish (Fold) Gaelic and Egyptian (Mau) I guess. If you want to curse your cat, on the other hand, you have to speak in Russian Blue.  




 Two things about cats. One is that they only pay attention if you speak in Siamese or Persian. The second is that they *will* get revenge. But yes, it certainly does apply. In my opinion cats seem to be less trainable because they aren't 'pack animals' like dogs and humans. Not that they are antisocial. far from it as any owner of multiple cats can tell you. It's just that the motivation of "simply wanting to please" is less prominent in them than in dogs. 




 Very often the proper answer is *nothing*. I'd recommend *never* punishing unless the action has just happened in front of you. It just doesn't work. All it does is convince the dog that you are irrational. Here's a scenario that tells the story.


 Dogs can be intelligent enough to learn a great number of words in a human language. In the case of some border collies this may amount to hundreds. What they are totally deficient in is *grammar*. Let's take conditional and future tenses along with 'moods'. If you say, "If you shit on the rug I will kick you outside". The dog hears, "Shit...rug...outside". In their mind the word 'shit' may be either an indicative or an imperative mood verb. The conditional tense doesn't enter their mind. Neither does the future tense of "kick". What the dog does is go over to the rug, shits on it and then goes to the door to be let outside. From their point of view they are doing exactly what you want. Because so much human-dog talk is imperative the dog takes it as such. 




 I swear to God that you're the first commentator who hasn't come from one of the less accepting states. 




 How on Earth does the City justify an *18%* interest rate ? That's heading towards payday loan territory. 




 You get what you pay for, and in this case the lobbyists get the better part of the Congress. 




 That's true. Smith's work has been the subject of a lot of misinterpretation. Both works are available on the internet. 




 Well yes, that's a legitimate question. 




 Sounds more like the computer than the site. I hardly have the most up to date tech either. 




 It's the same way in all federal systems. The USA may be a little bit more 'states' rights' than other federal countries. 




 You're welcome. 




 Thanks for the link. 




 It`s interesting to note that the limitations of `hair analysis, in particular the `false positives' have been known in an academic way for a very long time. The problems with this evidence are well presented in most forensic science textbooks. I can assume that many of the wrongfully convicted were represented by public defenders who gave their cases less attention than it deserved *or* that the defense budget in these trails was so limited that calling expert witnesses to dispute the prosecution's 'evidence' was not an option.

There are similar, if not as glaring, problems with fingerprint evidence, and, of course, 'lie detector' tests are notoriously unreliable. In an issue of The Match a few years ago Fred Woodworth gave a good overview of the problems with fingerprints. 




 Yes, anthropology/archaeology can often be that way. It's like a Sherlock Holmes  story, making conclusions from what looks like scanty evidence. 




 Yes, I guess it's the old 'headline writers' dilemma'. You have to be attention grabbing to draw in readers, but it's very easy to stray into overstatement. 




 I guess it depends on both where you live, where you work and what has happened recently. Someone who has to commute to work over bad roads or poor train service will be more concerned than others about infrastructure. Similarly people who live in communities that have recently had problems will be more concerned than others - even if say the water treatment plant is overdue to collapse as in the next hour. I think (?) that Britain has less of a problem with an infrastructure debt than the USA does, but I might be wrong about that. 




 Just an interesting blog piece about how far dual unionism *should* go. 




 Great. It's very much appreciated. 
























 I can understand the Teamsters, but I'm not too familiar with the situation in the Ironworkers and Pipefitters. What do you think were the points in dispute ? Were there actually meetings or was the whole matter handled by email without any member input ? There are a lot of questions here. 




 Yes, I've always found 'The Conversation' to be interesting, informative and well written. It's well worth following. 




 I think you're right. The part that gets me in the quote you post is the "outside of nature" part. 




 It can be useful, and I'd encourage it. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that the centers are usually funded by other unions and community groups. It would vary on a case by case basis as to how much 'gymnastics' have to be done to stay on their good side. 




 Yes, SPF ??. 




 I think that's probably a good suggestion. Of course I'm only the reposter, but maybe you should write the Pew Center about it. I don't know if they can easily edit their article or not, but it's worth a shot. 




 I get a chuckle out of such typos as well. I wonder if it was the human or the computer that made the mistake. 




 I wish you well. One thing that puzzles me... in your second paragraph you seem to be saying that your latest episode was less severe "because of facebook" Am I reading you right ? If I am correct about this it gets me thinking about the "how" of such a thing. Continual useful feedback perhaps ? 




 Thank you. This is a valuable contribution to the debate. 




 Well perhaps, but consider the most massive and rapid 'language spread' in human history. Language expansion such as English, Portuguese and French in the New World were obviously correlated with a gigantic 'gene flow'. The case of Spanish varies from country to country, but its presence in countries such as Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and the whole of the Hispanic Caribbean is also an example of gene flow/language change. In the case of the Caribbean there was a 100% replacement of the genes of previous occupants who spoke languages other than Spanish, English, French and Dutch. 

So...language change doesn't *always* correlate with gene flow, but in some cases the 'gene flow', often an euphemism for genocide, is the sole only explanation. It all depends on the situation. 




 That's the implication. 




 It puzzles me as well. The difference is so wide that I'm at a loss to explain it by factors such as smoking, obesity, etc.. On the other hand what innate sexual factor could cause such a disparity in this one type of cancer but not in others ? There's room for a lot of speculation here. 




 When you repost something from another subreddit it is considered courteous to mention that it is a repost. This was originally posted at r/worldanarchism. 




 Sorry, my error. 




 Yep, that's the item. I believe that it was first described in Naples which had extensive trading relations with Barcelona (under the Spanish Crown) at the time. From there it spread via the trade routes like the bubonic plague did in the 14th century from Genoa. Columbus' expedition sailed from Seville, but that city was something of an 'outport' compared to Barcelona. I believe it was where routes north to Barcelona, west to the Atlantic and east to North Africa branched. 




 There is a parallel for sure. 




 The general consensus is that syphilis came from the New World. The alternative hypothesis is that it developed from the tropical disease 'Yaws'. The first theory is the most accepted one. As for the Chinese they were in at least indirect contact with Europe for a long time before the 15th century. The Black Death, after all, did originate on the Mongolian steppes. 




 Yes, telling the future from innards is sometimes hard to *stomach*. 




 My first guess would be changes in diet, but why would that have more of an effect on males ? Estrogen mimics should theoretically cause an increase in a large number of different cancers. It's a puzzle to me.  




 Don't both sides already know who wins ? 




 Competition to tea leave fortune-telling I guess. 




 This is a pretty common response of municipal authorities whenever a big event, usually a sporting one, takes place in a city. The sweep, of course, can't by its very nature reduce the overall number of street people by one single person. It merely displaces the 'problem' to another location.  




 My mistake. It's been corrected. My keyboard sometimes misses the "w"s, and it did in this case in the **W**ikipedia part of the link. 




 I don't think so. As I read the article it seems to be promoting some sort of updated philosophical idealism in that the only reality is that created in the observer's mind. I disagree with this point of view, but when discussing it we leave the realm of physics and enter metaphysics. 




 There is a [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea_Ultima) that has links to various pictorial representations of speculations about future continents. 




 No problem. What's "SMH" ? 




 Just to clear up your misconception. I have **never** invited a single person to become a moderator at any time whatsoever. You can verify this by looking through the modmail. 




 This seems very much like any other time bank. What would you say makes a difference here ? 




 Le Guin is one of a very few sci-fi/fantasy writers who are open about their anarchist beliefs. Michael Moorcock is another. I'm sure others could add to this list. 




 I like the fact that the building they have repurposed used to be a prison, one that was used for many years by the Franco regime nonetheless.  




 Possible target for cancer therapy I'd presume. 




 Glad to see it. I wish you well. 




 Very interesting, and I hope to comment further. In any case thanks for reminding me about the digitalization project at the IISH. I read about it awhile ago, but it slipped my memory. Gotta have another look at that. 




 The problem is that the legal status of corporations usually shields the management from legal action. That being said there *have* been examples of individual executives and managers being sued. It's a complicated point of law. I do agree with your statement that the individuals should be charged. It's just that I am uncertain if they *can* be. 




 Good question. I've seen some reconstruction of dinosaur sounds, both terrestrial and aquatic, from studies of their nasal passages, but none that have been very specific. 




 Let's call it an example of 'The Joy of Title Cooking'. When presenting research news to the general public the whole culture of journalism and its markets pushes people towards the 'grabby' title. I read your link to NPR, and after you got past the title it wasn't that bad.  




 Yes, that's possible, but the nature of chaotic motion is such that nobody could predict it. Unless some craft was observing at the time probably all that we would see is 'moons at time zero' and 'no moons (or one) at time zero plus x'.  




 No, but you could at least invite him out for a few beers. 




 That's true isn't it. I can't cite chapter and verse, but I do recall that this sort of thing has been mentioned in terms of the possibility of life in multi-star systems. The multi-body problem strikes again. 




 Yes it was meant for you, even though you weren't the first accuser. If you weren't merely trying to clarify the original accusation then claiming that "they do not apply their supposed values to their on lives" is more than an allusion to purity. It is a direct implication/statement that the person who wants the amplifiers isn't "pure" because he wants said consumer good. If you say he is "hypocritical" you are applying a standard of judgement that judges his "purity" in relation to either his views, the views you think he holds or perhaps the views you *think* he should hold.

I don't know how many thousands (perhaps tens of thousands) of times I have heard similar accusations of hypocrisy/impurity leveled by leftists over the decades. Sometimes it sticks to the target. Usually it doesn't. It hardly ever sticks in the case of consumer goods. The *only* way it could be properly defined as hypocrisy would be if the target *consistently* demanded some renunciation of consumer goods from others. In such a case he would be "hypocritical" because he was impure himself.

In actuality it makes no difference whatsoever to the wider world if the target gets his amplifiers or not. His act of 'impurity/immorality' has no demonstrable physical consequence. If he doesn't buy the amplifiers someone else will. End of story. The only standard of judgement is about his personal character/purity. *That* is judgement of his purity or lack thereof. If he was doing something that had a real physical effect, such as being a boss then the accusation would have had a base in reality.

Once more, if you were merely explaining the original accusation I stand corrected. If you were supporting it then see above... 




 I think you have a point in that. 




 Well, if you wish to get into arguments about purity I've got a good analogy. The Jain religion takes 'non-harm' to its ultimate point. If you wish to be a *truly* pure Jain you end up starving yourself to death out of a reluctance to do any harm to any other living being. People can't live on salt alone. Out of millions of Jains at any one time there are only a few dozen going this route in India. It's basically unheard of in the diaspora. The greatest and most obvious reason why Jainism still exists is simply that at all times and places 99.9999% of the population will *always* choose to be 'impure'. Seems to me they make the sensible choice. 




 Yes. I perhaps date myself by saying that the electronic format is annoying enough to me that I *never* read a book that way - only in print. I'll read articles on the internet but not a book. 




 I believe that the efforts to make $15/hour the minimum apply to all low wage workers. It's just that people working in fast food make up such a large proportion of such people. 




 Yes, failure of the monsoons is amongst the possibilities of climate change, and its effects would be even more disastrous. To my knowledge climate change also had a big role in human evolution at the western end of the Indian Ocean. 




 Thanks for the info. 




 No doubt the writers take information through a 'supply chain' that begins with the military and their contractors and is thus 'optimistic'. I'm afraid I can't comment on the possibility you raise, but it is a caution worthy of mention. 




 That's true. It's like 'loading the dice' or 'fixing the wheel' in gambling.  




 If it did it would have been a great thing to do DNA analysis on. 




 Not really. It's long been a matter of dispute. 




 Fimbrae and adhesins are basically the same thing ie structures that bind the prokaryotic cell to surfaces such as an eukaryotic cell. The difference between the classical view of binding via fimbrae and the results described in the original paper is that the authors have uncovered a mechanism that leads to much firmer binding via a covalent bond to proteins on the cell surface. This is via thioester moieties. 

You can find the [original paper](http://elifesciences.org/content/4/e06638) at the online journal Elife, and the full explanation is there. 




 In order for a place name to be transmitted to newcomers there would have to be people on hand to tell the new people the name. I wonder if there is any documentary evidence of the Vikings finding people already there when they landed in Iceland. There is certainly writings about aboriginal people in regards to both Greenland Vinland.  




 Rent control is a local or state matter, not a national one. The other thing is that there is not a single example of rent *reduction* via such laws/regulation. They only slow down the rate of increase. 




 Given what I read of the early history the people who first formed PS had been active before Occupy, perhaps for years. Perhaps Occupy galvanized them by both a sense of possibility but also a demonstration of the failure of political movements that lack a program and a structure. 




 I don't know if it that apathetic. It probably depends on what community you live in. The prairies, however, were once one of the 'hot spots' of radicalism in Canada, but yes, it has been declining for decades. 




 I assume that they are taking this from the idea that subcutaneous fat was needed for insulation in the water. The 'aquatic ape' hypothesis has few followers today. If you think this is bad have a look at some of the other comments. 




 Yes that would be better. I used the original title from Nature. In the context of this paper the authors are using primary production - the total biomass produced - as an estimate for the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. The problem on reddit is that you can only edit text posts and comments, not titles. Otherwise I'd go with your suggestion. 




 Well, I suppose we could have a long conversation about doing something that is not only possible but actually being done as we speak, instead of living in resentment and doing nothing. We could also have a conversation about the pluses and minuses of 'worker1vote', and how I personally don't consider it the best model. *However* before any such thing I have to ask a question.......

*How on Earth do you think that a link to the **Freelancers' Union** and its Board of Directors where one of the Directors has a connection to Goldman Sachs has **anything whatsoever** to do with the pluses or minuses of a totally different organization ie the one in the article* ? ??? One can make many criticisms of both the USW and Mondragon, but dragging in a totally different union is not amongst the arguments. 




 Thanks. I found my mistake. The last numbers in the address are '34435' not '3445'. Sherlock Holmes and the case of the missing '4'. 




 There is a more detailed [article](http://www.alasbarricadas.org/noticias/node/3435) in Spanish at the site of the Spanish anarchist magazine A Las Barricadas. 




 Here's a few. I'll hopefully be adding others later.

 The trouble with the actions is that they aren't merely restricted to this particular company. There is a lot of other 'greenwashing' that happens. No doubt Norwegians should demand investment in renewable energy - which will probably be mostly hydro given the nature of the country, perhaps wind. The oil won't last forever. 




 Yes, "strive in vain" is a better translation. I've changed it in the body of the post. Thanks. I was puzzled by that last line. 




 I wish the Black Rose Federation well, but I am very doubtful about their success. Hopefully I am wrong. North America is a particularly 'unhealthy' environment for such an organization given the prominence of other 'points of view' amongst anarchists there. I was never a member, but I can remember saying back in 1980 exactly the same thing you say now; "it isn't time yet".  There have been other efforts since then, all of them eventually transient. NEFAC as a good effort, but it had its failings. Prior to that 'Love and Rage' went some distance, but its internal politics were basically - horrifying. I can remember reading the first edition of their paper, and the thought came into my mind; "What is this Maoist bullshit"; best I keep my distance from this crew." Of course not all of their efforts were Maoist influenced, but you simply can't have Maoists and sane people in the same organization.

Outside of the USA I'm fairly confident that there are no other Anglophone countries with the 'partial' exceptions of Ireland and the UK that are 'ready' in any sense. I think that the situation is different in other countries, but I might be wrong on this. It's easy to get a blurred picture from afar. 




 To speak to the question rather than other comments:

As time goes by in the 'anarcho-waiting room' if you have an open and critical mind you find yourself less and less able to accurately describe your anarchism with *one* particular label. All you can do is list the schools of thought that have influenced you rather than define you. For myself the main items are pretty typical: syndicalism, mutualism (in its socialist varieties) and to a lesser extent anarchocommunism (in the sense of community politics) and individualism (in its less dogmatic and rhetorical form). Above all I'm a gradualist. People who have influenced me in that direction include Proudhon (most of the time), Pi y Margall, Colin Ward, Joan Piero, Paul Goodman and a few others. Also many people who don't carry the @ label such as Jane Jacobs, Ivan Illich, Maurice Brinton and a few libertarian Marxists. 




 I really think that the high cost of living in the Vancouver area might just be due a itsy, bitsy, tiny bit to the real estate market which is something of a bubble. 




 Thanks. I just saw it way down at the bottom. Looks like I neglected to add the name to the post. Never saw that site before. I'm going to have to add it to my list. 




 In terms of simple economics the matter of minimum wages is not as clear cut as some conservative ideologues would like to make out. In terms of its connection with employment/unemployment levels I've argued the subject multiple time. In normal circumstances it has **no** effect on unemployment levels.

In this case, in the matter of services provided to the government of the City of Vancouver by private contractors (most of the actual government employees are covered by union contracts that guarantee them far more than the amount mentioned), it will most likely have absolutely no effect whatsoever on competitive advantage. The government simply doesn't contract out across borders to any appreciable extent and neither does it 'sell' to the outside. It's a local market that stops a few miles out of city limits. In terms of the local economy the effect would be stimulatory, increasing the funds in circulation. 




 I'm afraid I don't. I'll see if I can find it on the internet, but I doubt that it's available. Possibilities = 1)it was influenced by said book, 2) Berthier is a member of said group, 3)it was written by someone heavily influenced by the book, up to the point of paraphrase or 4) it's actually a crib from said book without attribution (shame, shame). I'll see what I can find out.

Part 4, the conclusion and my own thoughts, will follow soon. 




 There have been other attempts at unionization of bike couriers in various cities. I'm afraid that I am not current enough on the subject to say if any of them "stuck". 




 I'd imagine that they would be. Earth-based 'cloaking' is already well advanced. My first thought would be that they would establish a small nearby observation post (Mars, the Moon ?) from which they could keep track of things without being detected. If you were to believe 'flying saucer' stories then you have to assume that technological advance doesn't go hand in hand with caution and common sense. Or another hypothesis - they are galactic teases. Of course we shouldn't necessarily assume the usual human motivations to extraterrestrial life. Who knows. 




 I wonder ho you say "slumming" in Antarrese ? 




 No, you're right. It is a possibility.  




 Sort of "why *didn't* the chicken cross the road" ? 




 From an extraterrestrial point of view Earth may be "a nice place to visit, but nobody would want to live there". In any case it's pretty obvious that Earthlings aren't popular as dinner guests. Bad manners. Bad manners. 




 I hate to say it, but that went through my mind as well. I assume 'adult diapers'. The main brand that I am familiar with is called `Depends, but I`m sure there are others. 




 Thanks. It skipped my mind that when I cross post an article the links don't travel with it and I have to insert them again in the new texts. Good catch. 




 Neat. Thanks very much. 




 Communities of true believers are the same whatever the subject of the true belief is. As examples there are certainly more ex-Trotskyists at any given time than there are actual Trotskyists. As for true believing Marxist Leninists of a non-Trotskyist character well, all that I can say is that it will take a few decades before all the exes die off and the few hundreds of ignorant youngsters could outnumber the 'formers'. There are religious sects like that as well. The Jehovahs are the great example.

No doubt even anarchism sheds adherents over time, and this is nothing new. All that I can say to that is rather than going down the old 'rejection road' it is perhaps better to seek out a *better* anarchism to replace the childish one first adopted. Unlike religious or political cults there is no inherent barrier to such maturation. 




 I suppose you might find such claims in Bolshevik and later USSR propaganda at the time. You won't, however, find them verified in any reliable academic source if for no other reason than aside from two rather outr circumstances it would be physically impossible. I'll tell you why.

Let's begin by granting, for the sake of argument, that the anarchist groups were bloodthirsty thugs who would be more than happy to commit such atrocities if they could. If you believe a lot of the history written by Mennonites who emigrated to the West every single side (there were many) in the Civil War, except for them, of course, were barbaric, but the Makhnovists were the worst of the lot. Leave that situation aside because the Mennonites were as far from being Bolshevik sympathizers as it is possible to be. Let's situate the whole question.

First of all the anarchists. They were far less influential than anarchists often like to pretend. Aside from the Makhnovist army there were literally *no* other anarchist armed forces worth noting anywhere in Russia during the course of the Civil War. As to Kronstadt it should be noted that the anarchists were not a major force in that insurrection as well. In the last election held for the Kronstadt Soviet before the rebellion the anarchists gained all of 5% of the votes. The most influential political force amongst the sailors was probably the SR-Maximalists, a trend that some have described as being' half way between the Socialist Revolutionaries and the anarchists. In terms of sheer numbers the largest group of rebels was comprised of members of the Bolshevik Party who had left it in disgust in the years up to 1921. The *only* leader that historians label as 'anarchist, 'Stefan Petrichenko' was just such a person, and his career both before and after Kronstadt was 'checkered' to say the least.

Now, more importantly, there is the matter of the Bolsheviks and the peasantry. In 1917 the peasants comprised about 100 million people, 80% of the population. In December 1917, two months after the Revolution, the Bolshevik Party had the 'enormous' amount of members of peasant origin of 4,122. This was actually an improvement. In 1916 the Party had a total of *four* rural cells amongst this population of 100 million. At the Sixth part Congress in July/August 1917 there were **NO** peasant delegates. The first figure means that for every card carrying communist that they wanted to kill the 'anarchists' would have had to do in about 25,000 ordinary people if they operated purely on chance selection.

The Bolsheviks, of course, recognized their massive weakness in rural areas, and they made great efforts to recruit amongst the peasantry. By 1921 the Communist Party had grown rapidly to about 700,000 members. Too rapid for some. It was time for a purge. At that time there were about 197,000 'peasant' members, about 0.2% of the rural population. The Party purged about 98,500 of them. Even though the purge was partially directed at the left opposition within the Party its major rationale was to get rid of 'careerists' ie those who joined for monetary reasons. Keep this in mind. It will be important in untangling the claim of 'anarchist massacres of communist peasants'. In any case I'm sure that this would make the anarchists' murderous task much easier. Now they would only have had to go through a thousand peasants to get a commie as opposed to 25,000.

The purge had its rationale. The 'peasant' Bolsheviks were an interesting lot. Understand what the Bolsheviks were doing in the years of 'War Communism'. Basically they would send out detachments from the cities into the countryside for two purposes. One was to steal grain, so-called 'requisitions'. The other was to forcibly conscript peasants into the Red Army. When they were available they would send out workers with some sort of connection to the village in question, but such were rarely available. The detachments were basically looting expeditions and kidnapping squads. Once in a village they would try to enlist local collaborators who, of course, became members of the Communist Party. The character of these collaborators, *some* of whom were purged in 1921, is best described by the following from Samuel Farber's 'Before Stalinism: The Rise and Fall of Soviet Democracy';

Thus, among the new post-revolutionary rural Communists were to be found priests, former Tsarist policemen and government employees interested in advancing their careers.

Aside from the weakness of the anarchists another thing should be understood, the strength of the traditional party of the peasantry, the Socialist Revolutionaries. If one were to enumerate support for this incredibly disorganized and ineffective party its supporters would have vastly outnumbered those of the Bolsheviks even at the height of the latter's popularity. Besides being fractured, however, the SRs had other millstones around their necks. One was simple confusion about what they wanted. The SRs were long on good sounding rhetoric and short on practicality. Long on high sounding principles and short on details. The left SRs, who were in coalition with the Bolsheviks in the early months after October also carried a romantic attachment to terrorist tactics - totally useless in a civil war.

At the beginning of the revolution the peasants had a certain ill-informed sympathy for the Bolsheviks whom Lenin dragged kicking and screaming into a defeatist position and in  support of the peasant land expropriations which were generally taking place without the influence of *any* political party. He also convinced the Party to add the simplistic slogan of 'Bread' to those of 'Peace' and 'Land'. In the end the Bolsheviks delivered peace, stood aside in the face of the fact of land seizures and drew the country into a situation where the 'Bread' of 1917 looked like paradise in comparison to the famines during their fight for power, some of which was due to their theft of grain.

During the course of the Civil War the Bolsheviks faced peasant rebellions that literally numbered in the **hundreds**. I emphasize that. Hundreds ! Many more of these such as the Tambov Rebellion were inspired by the SRs as compared to the limited number inspired by anarchists. Even so the great majority were inspired by the natural resistance of people to thieves and kidnappers. It didn't require a political party for people to rise up against exploiters such as the Bolsheviks. The Bolshevik advantage was that these natural rebellions were almost always local and lacked coordination. There was also a great animosity between the right and left wings of the SRs. The former were willing to collaborate with the Whites; for the latter it was totally out of the question.

In the end the Bolsheviks won more because of the disorganization and outright stupidity of their opponents. Of the various White commanders only Wrangel was willing to make a small number of concessions to popular feelings, and these were indeed minor. Commanders like Kolchak, Kornilov, Yudenich or Denikin carried out a brutal campaign of slaughter and repression in whatever territories they controlled. As for the anarchists besides being minor players outside of eastern Ukraine they had other problems. If you like I could enumerate them. I'm an anarchist myself, but I'm a greater believer in truth. A lot of anarchists engage in wishful thinking in regards to Russia and the anarchist role in the revolution.

So to conclude this incredibly long reply there were simple reasons that the anarchists didn't 'murder Bolshevik peasants'. One is that, outside of eastern Ukraine there simply weren't enough anarchists to do any such thing. A large number of Russian anarchists who were anarchosyndicalists were just as much an urban phenomena as the Bolsheviks. The other reason is that the beast known as 'Communist peasants' basically didn't exist. There were detachments sent out from the cities to steal and kidnap. There were also small numbers of local collaborators who were usually not peasants at all. I am fairly confident in saying that there was not a *single* village in all of Russia where the majority were Bolshevik supporters by the time the spring of 1918 rolled along.

One more thing. Anarchists and more frequently SRs did indeed kill the occasional 'Bolshevik peasant' by accident when they killed other peasants. Amongst the anarchists there were those mentally ill 'individualists' who believed in individual acts of terror. When they attacked the general population with bombs or in robberies they may have killed a rare Bolshevik peasant by accident. These incidents were mercifully rare. Much more significant were those peasants forcibly conscripted into the Red Army as it deployed to fight the anarchists, SRs or ordinary peasants. A small number of those would have been Bolshevik sympathizers, but even though they outnumbered the innocent victims of idiotic terrorism they were still uncommon. These were the two 'outr circumstances' that I mentioned at the beginning.
 




 Not to my knowledge. What specific question do you think might be answered by such research ? I'd think that the general profile of isolated communities would show an increased level of relatedness. Other than that perhaps it might be useful in comparative studies of the general Swedish population. 




 Tons upon tons. All that I can do is French and Spanish, but there is a great ocean out there of items in such languages as Italian, Portuguese, German, Russian, etc.. I've been a long time admirer of your work. I particularly found your piece on Flora Tristan valuable. Please feel free to post items here at your convenience. Forgotten Anarchism is specifically targeted to translations of women anarchists of which you have done many. Have you done any of my favourite, Isidine/Korn/Goldsmith/Goldschmidt ? It's well looking into. She was the main force amongst Russian exiles in France in the late 19th/early 20th century. She was also Kropotkin's most frequent correspondent and translated his 'Ethics' into French from the Russian. Also a book by the Russian SR Lavrov. Makhno's secretary for awhile. It goes on and on. In terms of disputes she had the ability to find a middle position on pretty well any issue - which didn't endear her to many. Everybody on both sides would assume she was supporting the other side.

I was browsing through La Frondeuse from your link, and I found something you might not be aware of. Most of the links are working, but those that link to 'previous issues' of La Frondeuse end up as 'page not found'. Have a look at it if you have time.

Take care. B.

 It doesn't seem to be a problem for me. In any case...

""*WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)  Calling the Obama Administrations actions against the soccer organization weak and ineffective, Senator John McCain on Thursday proposed military action to dismantle and destroy FIFA once and for all.

These are people who only understand one thing: force, McCain said on the floor of the United States Senate. We must make FIFA taste the vengeful might and fury of the United States military.

McCain said that he was completely unimpressed by the Department of Justices arrests of several top FIFA lieutenants this week, calling the action the kind of Band-Aid solution that this Administration, sadly, has become famous for.

Rounding up a few flunkies in a hotel is meaningless when the leader of FIFA remains at large, he said. I will follow Sepp Blatter to the gates of Hell.

McCain requested a four-billion-dollar aid package for moderate elements within global soccer, and said that the United States should be prepared to put boots on the ground in Switzerland.

Calling the use of force against FIFA long overdue, he placed the blame for the groups alarming growth squarely on the shoulders of the White House. Barack Obama created FIFA, he said."*
 




 The debate will never end. Pluto has friends everywhere. 




 This puzzled me for a bit. I found what you were talking about in a comment to the original article at Nordic Science. It wasn't me, by the way. It's strange if for no other reason than it is totally disconnected with the subject of the article. Oh well. 




 I wonder how the two languages compare. Also Faroese. I always thought that Icelandic was the closest to Old Norse. 




 Thanks for the link. It's very informative.  




 Welcome. I guess the first sentence refers to a post at r/communismworldwide. The first post doesn't seem to be here. Feel free to post that as well. I wasn't aware that there was such a thing as post-scarcity *Marxism*. I've definitely seen it *hinted* at over the years but not stated bluntly.

I think it is a mistake for anarchists to assume that their will be one and only one economic system in the future. Various methods of distribution and of production each have their benefits and drawbacks. I think that experimentation is and would be the order of the day. The only restrictions on this would be that central planning by a state or a *completely free market that allowed or encouraged monopoly would not be worth striving for. 

In any case I think that a mixed economy would be the best and perhaps the *only* system that would be efficient, democratic, liberating for the individual, ecologically and socially stable and perhaps even *possible*. A totally open, moneyless system of distribution in which all goods and services would be open to all takers, essentially complete anarchocommunism which 'post-scarcity' says is possible is neither desirable nor possible. Let's deal with the possible part first.

Personally I think that it is an essential part of anarchism, as it should be for any socialism, that the basic necessities of life are provided to all people, regardless of their position in a system of production. Everyone should have housing, food, clothing, opportunity for personal development, mobility within reason, electricity, running water, sewage and garbage service, etc., etc., etc.. All of these are such that they *should* be distributed free which is in  fact anarchocommunism in practice if not in the sense of a complete system.

There are, however, things for which there is a **natural** scarcity. Everybody should have shoes, but personally designed ones are, of necessity, scarce. Everyone should have mobility, but not everyone in the whole world who *wants* to go to Venice should arrive there all at once. It's basically elbow room only at certain times of the year as it is when it costs money. Not everyone can have an original Picasso hanging on the wall. Everyone should have decent clothing, but if the idea of 'fashion' persists in a freer society I can't see either the need nor the possibility of this being provided free. Everyone should have decent food, but the desire for gourmet cooking with exotic ingredients can't be satisfied for a whole society at no cost. Everyone should have decent housing, but not everyone who wants to live in a palace can be satisfied. The list goes on and on.

My own viewpoint is that a basic decent life should always be available free of charge, but that a secondary exchange economy, a market if you will, should run in parallel for those goods and services that are simply *not* infinite. I differ from left libertarians like most American mutualists in that I would see more of the economy socialized than they would because I don't have the faith in some market that they do.

There are other arguments against a totally socialized economy, but I will restrict myself to natural scarcity for now. Your opinion is that food is one of the items which are naturally scarce. This is at least *partially* true, but it's a complicated matter that I'll try and speak to later.

By the way, thank you for the post. This is the sort of rational dialogue that I'd like there to be more of.

You raise a number of issues, but I'll speak to only one for now. Others later 




 Thank you. You're probably right. The 'Elf' just struck me as amusing. As to the picture, however, you must admit that it is damn hard to get a picture of a real elf. Camera-shy big time.

What struck me about your post was something else; 'dalen' as valley. English still has at least one word derived from the same root ie "dale" which is another name for valley. Admittedly it isn't used much these days. Out of sheer curiosity I'm going to try and find any English words other than 'elf' that derive from Old Norse, Old Germanic, etc.. 




 I hope the lesson took on them. 




 I don't believe so. 




 The side bar definition seems fairly reasonable to me. If it was up to me I'd expand it (the side bar) a bit in terms of 'democratic decision making' at the base of such a society, in both the workplace and the community. I'd also expand it in terms of the federalism that is necessary to run such a society ie the institutional cooperation between workplaces and communities, both local and distant. Sort of adding the 'fraternit' to the .egalit'. 




 The last is indeed the big question. The planned mission will, at best, find evidence for a "possibility" for life not any proof. 




 Quite connected to 'Bakunin against insurrectionism' 




 You are certainly right. The article referenced has the 'give-away' term 'some' in the body of the article itself. 




 Thanks for the clarification. 




 I remember a few years ago when there was a big copyright fight, and one archive (I believe it was the Marxists.org archive) had to remove some of their material. I see that this is being posted from Mexico, and copyright might be different there.

In any case there's a problem in the presentation. If you enlarge the text so that it is readable you find that it is often 'seeing double'. Somehow, someway the process of uploading messed up. The result isn't unreadable, but it is difficult. 




 It depends upon what you call a "human" fossil. As for Homo sapiens the time is much shorter, 200,000 yrs BP. You are probably speaking of the origin of the genus Homo which has been dated from 1.9 mil to 2.5 mil yrs BP. The line of descent, however, goes much further back but 30 mil yrs ago there was nothing that could remotely be called human. The genus Hominoidea dates to about 25 mil yrs BP.  I don't think that the appearance of the genus Homo is any more significant than any of the other branching points. There is ongoing work on the paleoecology in east/south Africa that may have had an effect on human evolution. Climate seems to have a lot to do with the evolution of humans.

Thanks for the comment by the way. It was thought provoking. 




 Yes, it would, but loss of muscle tone during development would probably imply more serious problems that would make the embryo unviable in any case. 




 Cross post from r/worldanarchism. 




 This post reminded me of a website that I haven't heard from for some time. Finally it clicked in memory. It's called [Forgotten Anarchism](http://forgottenanarchism.wordpress.com). It a regular collection project that posts translations by anarchist women writers of the past, and it's quite interesting. The originals are so far in French, Spanish and Portuguese.  




 Yes, but said monopoly may not be an eternal thing. 




 One of the 'bads' is that sometimes recycling is not.... Cities have set up recycling systems and ended up taking the trash collected to the dump anyways. Not that this is very common, but it does happen. 




 Some of the article certainly assumed a familiarity with a lot of anatomical terms that might be difficult. I wonder if you might be looking for some sort of introductory material, and perhaps I could help. 




 Thank you. Interesting. 




 I remember reading this a few months ago and thinking it was a very good article. Looks like I'm going to reread it. If people follow the Spanish or French @s unions you'll see that they are quite active outside of the workplace. Even non-@ unions like the Longshoremen go outside the traditional bounds that more conservative unions stick to. It's something that should be a lot more frequent. 




 Not really on the subject matter of the post, but I've never seen "locked down" used in this way. 




 Sort of like a "pre-obit" ? 




 The  'blank slate' is an ideological position that is held by a small number of academics in certain disciplines, and, like you say, it is rare. On the other hand the 'nativist' position as you call it is equally rare, rare to the point of non-existent as a matter of fact. The idea that *all* human behavior is genetically determined only exists in the imagination of those who propagandize against this made-up 'enemy'. In the world of academia the whole question was settled over 25 years ago, and nowadays evolutionary psychology is a very vast and productive field in which people of very different social and political views work. The question has been settled.

Having a certain acquaintance with 'learning theory' it is obvious that the adherents of 'behaviorism' accept a biological basis. You can't do science without it. At the same time, however, those who favor a more 'nativist' approach also understand the importance of 'learning'. The whole matter is not an either/or one.

As to Skinner it has been a longer time than 25 years since I have read anything by him. I presume he has been dead for some time. I won't try and pontificate on his morality. What I will say is that the view that human emotions and opinions are infinitely malleable is a view that would-be social engineers find very comforting whether they be of left or right wing persuasions. The idea of a 'human nature' that can't be 'conditioned away' should be at the base of any left wing point of view. The views of Stalin are the same as those of Hitler on this matter. 

Like I said, I won't try and judge Skinner's morality even if I found his 'Walden Two' quite unpleasant about 40 years ago. Very few great evils in this world have been committed by people who didn't think they were doing good.  




 I gather you don't like his ideas. I don't agree with all of them myself, but what do you disagree with ? 




 As for 'marriages', at my age after a lifetime of avoiding events that require that I dress up I am at the situation where I avoid funerals more than I avoid marriages. Mercifully most of my grandnephews and grandnieces have already crossed that threshold. As for the grandchildren it's unfortunately coming up. Ick !

It's nice to be able to take a long view. As I recall the attitude towards gay people has certainly varied from time to time as you mention. This has generally gone along with a general societal view of sex in general.

Here's the important point that I guess I will have to repeat. I have only a bit of doubt that a 'bourgeois' world would have a bit of difficulty in accommodating something like gay marriage. In our present world which I chose to call 'managerial' there is no such economic barrier. In fact the general  'meritocratic' cast of the economy argues 'for' it rather than against it. We live in a different economy than that of the 1930s, let alone the Victorian Age where a view such as yours would be more accurate.

Yes, the misnamed 'bourgeois world' "approves" of it in your terms. What I would say is that people should accept this and approve of it. It's an advance towards general equality, and whether gay relationships are "boring and absurd" is irrelevant at this time in history. It's what many/most gay people want, and it is an advance that non-gay people will agree to . Not every single thing that happens in society has to be viewed in a lens of 'not enough'. 

You may indeed criticize a society on the basis of 'property relations' in marriage, but this criticism becomes less and less relevant in a society that is increasingly 'single' and in which property rights are increasingly differentiated in the legal institution of marriage. This is no longer 1890. 




 Did anyone ever take a survey on the political views of gay people rather than extrapolating from news reports and personal acquaintance ? I am *sure* that the gay community is pretty much the same as the straight community with a moderate shift to 'the left'. That shift would be expected from life experiences, but it is a mistake in my opinion to equate being gay with being 'radical'. I'm old enough to remember Stonewall if not the Mattachine Society and the Daughters of Bilitis that preceded them. Very 'bourgeois' them.

Here's the trick. Something like sexual orientation is **not** a direct path to any sort of radical political or economic views. That doesn't mean that advances in the public position of gay people are not 'progressive' as it's called. It still is most definitely so. A managerial society such as ours *can* accommodate a position of equality, and it definitely *should*.  Any proper socialist should support initiatives to free gay people from discrimination/restrictions. That's part of socialism. On the other hand socialists shouldn't entertain illusions that things that can legitimately be granted under managerial society and are in the end to the benefit of such a society are some sort of inherent 'contradiction' as Marxists would say. They aren't, and I could cite Marx on the so-called 'progressive' nature of capitalism as an example of the way I view things.

The criticism of marriage that you mention was quite prominent '40 years ago'. Since then it has diminished considerably. It was a different time. You think this is unfortunate. Personally I have no opinion on whether it is good or bad. It just **is**. I take a longer view. In the absence of any great change I'll take the small changes that are possible at a given time as they come. 




 It's poking fun at a certain trend in American politics (and pretty well nowhere else in the world today) where the message of the NT is distorted in the service of certain current political views. 




 All contemporary rhetoric aside socialism has always held the concept of 'equality' as a good. Thus any legislation that automatically denies some people a 'social good' while granting it to others is against the principles of socialism. This hasn't always been recognized in all places at all times, but it is an inevitable logical conclusion. Thus, it is relevant to socialism in the same way that restrictions on this or that ethnic group are. Suppose you were a socialist who for whatever reason thought that a gay orientation was 'immoral'. Even if you held that position you would still have to accept the recognition of gay marriage if you wished to still consider yourself 'socialist'. 

This relates to another contemporary question, that of abortion. Shall we say you are a 'member' (not an accurate description - 'believer' would be better) of the 'Catholic Left'. As such you will usually oppose abortion, but, for the sake of consistency, you will *not* seek legal prohibitions on it, but will rather argue against it in a free forum of ideas. People on the 'Catholic Left' are usually socialist in one way or another, and they resolve the contradiction in this way. 




 Thank you for the reference. I haven't read the paper before, but a quick skim says that it's a valuable source. The hypothesis predates 1999 (the date of the paper), but this seems like a good review in reference to Homo erectus. Once more thanks. 




 "Who would Jesus bomb ?" Or maybe picture the Holy Spirit as a drone ? 




 I have no doubt they are "speaking" in their new jobs. They are also "walking" to the meetings with their friends, "writing or emailing" their friends, influencing other to do favors and so on and so forth. Let them do it, but let them not get paid for it. That's the difference. You can say that Caesar should be killed in the streets of Rome, but that's different from supplying the daggers. 




 Not really. It is, of course, a "change in life history" **but** the *potential* for such a change could easily be a "spandrel". I'll present a simple example. Suppose we take the prevalence of genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2. I would presume that there would be selection against such genes, and I would presume that the selection pressure would be stronger in past times when breast cancer was a death sentence. OK, that's the original "selection". Said selection would operate even in the conditions where a human ancestor was more likely to die "before old age" due to things like falls and Saber-Tooth tigers *because* even young women get breast cancer albeit at a lower rate than old women.

Now fast forward to today (or the last 100 years in *part* of the world). Even though women have less chance of dying young from all the Sabertooths wandering around the selection pressure still exists even if it is diminished. Older women have a *higher* chance of getting breast cancer than younger ones do. Relieve the "cut-off" of early death and the effect of selection against BRCA 1 and 2 doesn't just remain - the effect of its removal is **magnified** in demographic surveys because more older women live through breast cancer of which they have a higher incidence.

This is a classic incidence of a 'spandrel'. The selection is *not* for anything like increased lifespan after fertility. It is an example of where selection for one thing has unexpected events in a difference situation. The selection was *not* for the longevity that wasn't a usual situation 'back then'. It was for something quite different, but it has benefit in a new situation. This means it is....a spandrel. 




 Give him a break. Who do you think he is - God ? 




 Well, they're definitely not "turning the other cheek" except that of the victim to double-slap them. I've read the Bible, but it's been quite a few years. All the same I find it quite amazing how ignorant some believers are about the book they claim to follow.  With my old person's memory I am pretty sure that I have forgotten much more than they have ever learned, and I still know much more than they ever will. 




 The 'New Alabama Version^TM' I presume. 




 I checked. The part that you heard was when they were talking about Sainte-Marie's being blacklisted, not about government actions against native nations in general. Ste.-Marie lays the blame for the actions against her on *individuals* rather than any written government policy in any inter-office memo. What she is saying is true in a strictly legal sense. It also fits in very well with her general point of view that individuals are much more important than institutions. It's the way she views the world.

I also was reminded of the title of the song 'These Ones' that was in my mind. It's 'Now that the buffalos gone'. Going over the article carefully also brought another thing to light. I can remember Ste.-Marie on Sesame Street, but I never realized how long it has been since she moved to Hawaii. It registered today that it's been over 30 years. Hum. 




 Yes, but I think that the idea is that such individuals were 'helpers', and more children of theirs and their relatives 'survived'. 




 Thanks for the link. 




 That doesn't sound like Sainte-Marie, but there may be a certain subtle context here. In some of her songs she presents the listener with a challenge. Two pop into my mind. Excuse me, I am bad with song titles. I tend to remember them via 'key phrases'  rather than printed title. I'm thinking of 'Soldier Blue' and 'These Ones'. In both cases she mentions 'the government', of course, but she also challenges non-native people to oppose the actions of said government. The *emphasis* is not on the evil actions of the state but rather on the moral *obligation* to take a stand against the actions.

I'll check the transcript to see if this possibility is correct. 




 I believe that Stephan J. Gould would have called such unintended consequences 'spandrels' as in his essay taking the metaphor of St. Mark's in Venice. Quite frankly I'm agnostic about an adaptive explanation in this case as I believe the paper's author was. 




 If reproduction happened towards the end of an animal's life and the progeny would die without maternal care there would be no selective pressure for such late reproduction to persist. I think the author is talking about reproduction that is not "on the edge of the grave". It seems that there would be a 'balance' of selective pressures. As the article discusses animals in captivity show post-reproduction longevity that isn't evident in the wild. This implies that the 'risks of life' are such that such a balance exists under natural conditions, and that the scenario you discuss is a very unlikely one. 




 The journal 'Trends in Ecology and Evolution' is published by Cell Press, a branch of Elsevier. Yes, it is a reputable journal. I don't know if I understand your first point correctly, but it seems you are criticizing what is actually the common usage in these sort of papers. People routinely say that a certain trait is selected "for" or "against", and their statements contain the *implied* name of a trait that is the *opposite* of the trait they are speaking of. I know you are probably implying that a 'selectionist' argument for the origin of post-reproduction longevity doesn't necessarily follow from its contradiction of the expectation quoted above.

Now that's true, and the article in fact discusses this along with a number of other open questions surrounding the phenomena of this longevity. It's a *review* article not a report of results from original investigation, and as such it is open ended. It doesn't advance any firm answers. The point you raise is discussed in the context of comparisons of humans to other animals that show post-reproductive longevity *in captivity* but not *in the wild*. It's an interesting point to ponder. 




 That's a possibility, but it depends on what its competitors are doing at the time. How oligarchic is the industry and how much opportunity is there for collusion in such things ? Personally I don't know. 




 Oh shit. My mistake. I am demanding a full confession from my middle right hand finger. 




 He lived to 98 if I recall correctly, and he was active politically in pacifist/anti-nuclear weapon groups right up to the end. I have a mental picture stored in memory of a photo of this incredibly old guy at a demonstration. 




 I wouldn't call that "idiotic" at all. One of the hallmarks of scientific inquiry when it is quantitative is that it *always* admits to the possibility of error and tries to estimate the probability of such error. 




 You are **completely** insane. 




 Thank you. I read the first, but it was many years ago. I've never read the second. I have a stack of his books, and I'll look through it to see if I have it. 




 Really ??? If someone makes a claim the 'burden' is on those who disagree to *prove the negative* ? That's an old one. In any case **I** claim that you owe me every single penny that you have, and I'd like this debt to be paid **SOON**. The burden is, of course, on *you* to prove my claim is false. The next knock on your door will be from the repo-man. 




 Well, that is true. The trick is that it takes a massive amount of self-deception to convince yourself of certainty in every aspect of life. No doubt people need a certain amount of 'certainty' if for no other reason than to avoid paralysis. Yet it is impossible to have this all the time in human life. Russell says that philosophy 'trains' you to live with this. Whether this is true or not I don't know. 




 That seems reasonable to me. Sorry, I didn't notice the flair button. It seems pretty light on the board. 




 Are you sure about that ? Sorry, I had to do it. 




 Well that too, but as Russell might say you have to be uncertain about it. 




 I imagine that this isn't the only 'card-trick' that Walmart is pulling. 




 That's an interesting interview. One point, however, is never addressed. Nader doesn't seem to condemn Sanders' choice to run for the Democratic nomination as opposed to running as an independent. He weighs the pros and cons and refrains from making a judgement. That's fine. What is missing is the possibility/probability that *both* paths are futile in the American political system, a system that massively handicaps any challenger from outside the 'corporate consensus'. I'd be willing to say that participation in national elections is n exercise in futility. Nader doesn't seem to want to come to grips with that. 




 I agree. It's a very valuable mission. 




 Yes, that is the scenario that suggested itself to me. 




 Yes, but to be replaced by **what** ? Perhaps something far worse. 




 At the same time as some other countries are trying to get out of the nuclear industry. 




 Just a little thing on Zerzan. Have a quick look at his history. You'll find he's done a lot of travelling. Quite a lot ! Like many such people of his opinions he has *easily* dumped the greenhouse gas equivalent of 10 to 20 ordinary people into the atmosphere. Go outside of the USA to take your sample. In some countries the numbers would run into the hundreds. There are so many old sayings..."do as I say, not as I do", the Biblical tales of hypocrisy(motes/beams, sepulchers), "those who can do and those who can't teach", etc.. 




 You're welcome. 




 The latest news on this is that the Mexican government has offered to mediate between the growers and the workers. They say that they will 'top up' any offer from the growers to a wage level they (the government) feels is adequate. The growers will, of course, 'bid low' in such a situation, and the result will be a government subsidy to their businesses. It's unknown at this time if the government offer is acceptable to the workers. 




 I don't think so. It would merely imply a system with feedback. 




 Or writes, types, says, yells, broadcasts, sends by smoke signals, communicates, sends by semaphore flags, sends telepathically, calls for, warns, paints, grunts, whispers, mumbles, etc.,etc.. The noun as a subject doesn't guarantee that there is a separate conscious entity with intent that 'does' the verb. The wind may 'warn' you of oncoming rain. The position of the Sun may say that the day is almost over. 




 Well done.  




 I'd agree that that is certainly a factor. 




 I'd guess so though it doesn't seem to connect to idealism in my opinion. "I" is a subject pronoun ie something that does something. "Me" is an object pronoun ie something that is the object of either a verb or a preposition. The first pronoun is an actor, the second something that is acted upon. You use "construct" as a noun, but it comes from the verb "to construct" in the same sense as "building" is to "to build". The difference is built into the English language. 




 To whomever thinks that they perceive such a thing I'd guess. 




 Corporatism is *definitely* a word. Historically it meant one of the most important points in the definition of fascism. It means that employers and workers are *compelled* to sit down together in regular planning organizations under the tutelage and with the participation of the state so as to govern and plan the economy. The ideological justification of this is that the population is supposed to work together for the benefit of 'the nation'. These days this sort of management is more often called "tripartism". It exists in all developed countries to one degree or another and with various organizational mechanisms.  




 Well, it's a possible alternative story to the official one. I'm still agnostic about it though. The main sticking point for me in the official version is why on Earth would they dump the body overboard. 




 Thanks. 




 Well, I'd agree with the caveat of "in most circumstances" ie not always. Other than that we're saying the same thing, disagreeing with the claim of the Prime Minister. 




 I don't think so. It's hard to quantify this sort of thing. There is opposition to the socioeconomic structure in pretty well all countries all the time. Where do you draw the line and say this or that event/organization/struggle/etc. is active enough to go in say a 'plus column'. Judging this sort of thing can end up very subjective. That being said I would (subjectively) say that 2015 is less 'active' than say 2011 (Occupy, Indignados, Arab Spring), and I think it would be hard to argue otherwise. 




 What city is the school located in ? 




 I would go with Oceania because I think it is more descriptive of Pacific islands. As for Cuba how about 'Central America/Caribbean' instead of just 'Central America' ? Thanks for the work. 




 Slightly edited for length - B 




 I never knew that (that it was invented by a gay man). Can you tell the story ? 




 Yes, I've seen people blaze through crossings and even weave around lowered barriers. It certainly happens. 




 Yes, that can happen, but it's unfortunately rare. More frequent though still uncommon is a worker refusal to collect user fees from customers/users/etc. . This tactic has been used in the case of public services such as transportation.

EDIT: I should also add, of course, that there have been instances of 'recuperated' workplaces where production is indeed taken over by the workers and collection by the employer is terminated. The most outstanding example would be the numerous workplace takeovers in Argentina, but there are other examples. The factory in Thessalonica in Greece and a bicycle factory in Germany come to mind, but there are undoubtedly many other examples, some successful, some failures. 




 I'm unfamiliar with Warren's history. Did she actually used to be a Republican ? 




 It's a burgeoning field indeed. There are definitely papers that connect the microbiome with neuroscience. As to developmental neuroscience I'm not too sure. 




 Maybe, but the gradual move away from organized religion began decades before there was such a thing as Facebook. Also, unfortunately, a lower rate of social ties extends beyond the realm of religion. It's been given many names, anomie, alienation, etc., and it goes beyond theological beliefs.  




 The Hubble is observing in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum for two reasons. One is that it gives a good method to estimate the age of a given white dwarf because as it cools the emissions become less energetic ie change to a smaller frequency/longer wavelength. The second is that it is useful in identifying said stars. The dwarfs *begin* with high radiation in the ultraviolet as compared to an ordinary star because their previous evolution has 'blown away' the outer layers that 'shielded' the hottest part of the star, the core. In a normal star the ultraviolet radiation from the core is absorbed by the outer layers. I hope this clears up the confusion. 




 The article is from the 'Global Times', published in China with the *permission*, if not with the complete oversight, of the authorities. It takes an aggregate of the top and bottom 20% and compares them. No doubt if you were to take the top 0.1% or 1% the ratio would perhaps be even more astounding than 2 orders of magnitude.

What is remarkable is how far China has progressed in that income inequality is a subject for journalism at all. The numbers may be 'massaged', but the simple admission is a sign of progress. 




 You're right. It's the original unaltered title so I didn't make the oops. 




 A lot of things are 'beneath the notice' of the US mass media. World news, of course, cuts into the time allotted to charting the lives of celebrities. One current example is the present scandal surrounding sexual assault on minors by US military personnel stationed in Colombia. It's a big item in Latin America but rarely mentioned domestically even though it *does* involve the USA directly. 




 It seems like a metaphoric way of saying 1)that he won't grant the demands and 2) increasing wages will simply be eaten up by inflation due to the raises. The part "beyond what the state can offer or has proposed" seems repetitious, but it has an escape hatch if he does decide to compromise. Like any politician or manager he will keep saying 'no' right up to the very hour he does 'yes'. If the unions win (or half win) it will suddenly be discovered that the state *can offer* more than before.

As to the matter of the connection between wages and inflation that is quite a complex matter. There is no one-to-one correspondence between wage rates and inflation. Inflation rates are measured in different ways by different organizations with different 'weighting' of consumer items. Some of these, especially imports. are very insensitive to wage rates in a given country.

I'll give an very simple example - bananas. I think we can be certain that there are no banana plantations in Iceland, and all the bananas are imported. They probably arrive by plane, but there is a small chance they arrive by ship. I don't know. Suppose that the wages of say 40% of Icelanders go up. The cost of importing bananas remains essentially the same. The wages of Icelandic pilots, longshoremen or truck drivers represent a minimal fraction of the cost to the seller in Iceland of those bananas. Now will their increased resources due to higher wages lead a significant number of Icelanders to start eating bananas with every meal ? No. That would be incentive for a retailer in Iceland to increase the price because of higher demand, hence contribute to inflation if bananas are part of the 'consumer basket'. But it doesn't happen. The demand for bananas is not elastic in terms of consumer income.

This is, of course, a simple, even simplistic, example, but many other items are similar. Hence the lack of direct correlation between wage increases and inflation. 




 Yep, if you're in the boxing ring don't pull your punches. 




 Or possibly *very quiet* aside from demonstrations. When these sort of things are done in various countries the unions involved make sure to preserve a skeleton staff for essential services. For instance the electricity would still flow, but you wouldn't be able to pay your bill, nor visit the power company office, nor get a person on the phone so you could complain. No doubt this sort of situation is eventually unstable. It usually ends with everything going back to normal with either gains or losses for the workers involved. In rare cases (certainly not in Iceland) either military repression or the fall of the government happens.

So no, not chaos because a lot of day to day activity in a society can indeed be set aside for awhile. Also the action of the strike movement may appear chaotic to some because it poses a threat to their interests, but it is anything but chaotic to the participants.  




 There have been cases where companies have done *exactly* that, simply tap into the municipal water supply. 




 The sponsoring organization, Amnesty International, isn't noted for its "shadiness". They have had a stellar record over the decades. You will also note that there is *no* appeal for funds, merely online support. It's not like you are watching a televangelist. As to another to possible sources of doubt: Yes Paraguay *does* have such laws. The arrest of the criminal stepfather was announced on many media outlets yesterday. Google 'Paraguay abortion' and see the coverage. Finally, ten year old girls *can* become pregnant. It's rare, but it happens.

I hope that this may answer your doubts. 




 Perhaps she already has and he either said 'no' or, more likely, said it would only happen with sufficient public pressure.  




 It's hard to say what's happening in Raul Castro's mind. It *could* be pure apple polishing. On the other hand there is always a certain nostalgia in the minds of ex-Catholics. Once you get over the anger at the Church you come to appreciate the attractions (mostly not theological) of the tradition. It's not that you wrestle over the doctrine. It's more like you appreciate the art, the music, the lives of (some !) saints, etc.. As for the doctrine... well people have a nostalgia for their childhood as well. 




 Jones definitely. Not Alex but rather *Jim* Jones of People's Temple fame and the bane of the makers of Kool-Aid. A lot of the people 'over there' with free market views are **very** open in labelling his following as a cult, just like the Ayn Rand cult. His only saving grace is greed. His desire to keep raking in the money is likely the main thing holding him back from a dive straight into the deep end. 




 Mostly but not entirely right. While not as accurate and precise as sampling from several stations worldwide historical CO2 levels can be estimated from ice cores. From these the CO2 level is the highest in 11,000 years. 




 Thank you. That's interesting news. 




 Yep, it has been looked at. Over at the [California Department of Water Resources](http://www.water.ca.gov/desalination) (a busy place these days no doubt) they discuss a project initiated in 2002 that was to fund a mix of feasibility studies, pilot plants and actual operating facilities. They set up the 'California Desalination Task Force' which produced a seemingly detailed report, available on the site, in 2008. Yeah, I know, not lightening speed. I don't know the details about how all this turned out or what the situation is more recently, but I imagine there is more current material available from both this Department and other groups. 




 Yes, I can see your first point. I think that there may have been other problems with power imported by California, but what they may have been escapes my memory right now. Nuclear in an earthquake zone on the coast of the Pacific wouldn't be a good idea. Think Fukushima. In terms of fossil fuels natural gas would be the least expensive and pose the least environmental problems. But, as you point out, whatever the problems it may be the *only* solution. I wonder if the State has studied this alternative in any detail. I'm going to have a quick look. 




 Yes, it would naturally be cheaper as there would be no losses of power in transmission. It would also be a 'plus' for oil and gas exporting states, but I can't see how it would be a financial plus for California because it would be a net payment to out-of-state producers. It would, of course, be a plus in the sense of getting potable water, and it may sooner or later become a necessity. I think that the cost would be significant enough to make it necessary for the State to put up some of the seed money. It would probably be beyond the resources of a city. Then I recall that California has had troubles over its debts before. This gets more complicated the longer I think of it. 




 I don't really know, but I would guess high capital costs and high energy requirements. Saudi Arabia, no surprise there, operates desalination plants, but I don't think they supply the entire country. I also believe that some of the Gulf states do likewise. The advantage there is easy access to a constant supply of oil. 




 Thanks for this article Mike. I've mentioned RojoyNegroTV here before, but this piece is much more informative than what I presented. One thing I noticed... really and *truly* producing a proper television show and station is a lot more complicated than my limited experience told me. It's a world away from a ten minute video on YouTube for sure. I wonder if other groups such as the French FA might want to do something similar. They do, after all, produce Radio Libertaire. 




 There's undoubtedly a cost factor in the equation, but the bad publicity they were getting was a factor as well. The first may or may not be a wise economic choice given the capitalization costs of the move versus any long term savings. The latter is an avoidance of loss of income which is also factored in. 




 I once read that in the ancient Persian Empire that the court had the following way of making decisions. Everyone would get roaring, falling down, vomiting all over yourself drunk and make the decision. Then the next morning (or early afternoon) they'd look at the decision and see if it still looked as good as it did the night before. Seems 'more or less' reasonable to me. 




 It is. It shows that public pressure *can* have an effect. There has been a long-standing campaign against their plant. It is, admittedly, the proverbial drop in the bucket in the picture of California's water woes. 




 I also think the bad publicity had a lot to do with it. No doubt they will put the best spin possible on the move. Also, like every other company, they go shopping in the 'tax break market' which often contains outright gifts. They're moving to Pennsylvania though *not* Detroit. That would be about the *last* place they would consider. Whatever else you might say about the executives they aren't crazy, and neither are they drunk 24/7. 




 That was good. The British answer to 'The Onion' is running ahead of the American it seems. 




 It depends upon what you mean by "many". An accurate estimate is hard to come by, but let's try something with a few assumptions. Let's set up a little game of 'statistics'. The first thing you have to understand - and accept and realize the implications of - is that for every person who may criticize Obama "from the left" there are something like 20,000 people of other political views. I may be *generous* to 'the left' with this, and I am lumping in *all* forms of leftism in one mass.

Now let's assume that about 50% of these people with *other* views are more or less approving of Obama and either ignorant of or in disagreement with the views of people 'to the left of Obama'. That leaves a number of the order of about 10,000. This means that for every 'leftist' post on a place like r/socialism if you went by pure chance there would be 10,000 people hitting on it who like Obama and only one who looks at him 'from the left'. 

Here comes the tricky part. How many of these people might have a more or less favourable view of a word like 'socialism'. This varies from country to country. It would be lowest in the USA but higher in other parts of the 'anglosphere' such as Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and goodly numbers of people in countries such as India, Pakistan, etc. where English is a lingua franca in multilingual nations. Let's try and set a low enough number such as 5%, one in 20. This reduces the likelihood to 500 to one that the viewer would be such an 'Obama friendly' person.

There are, of course, other factors that reduce this still further. Suppose that only 10% of the population are interested enough in politics to cruise the internet looking for subjects such as Obama (a quite high number) or socialism (a lower number). Now we're down to 50 to 1. A certain number immediately flee when they see their Saint criticized, are already heavily prejudiced against Obama and the left in general (already accounted for above), react with anger at the criticism, don't think it's important and skip over it or have sensible arguments about why "Obama is still a better deal" because of realism. Let's say 90% to 95% of the population bow out because of such things. That still leaves 2.5 to 5 people made up of 'Obama believers' to one 'lefty believer'.

Now the final reduction. From pure 'interest' let's say that a 'lefty' is 100 times more likely to keep coming back to a place like r/socialism. This leaves a 2.5 to 5 percent chance that an 'Obama believer' might see such an item and that it registers. This compares *very* favourably with the chances of the usual leftist propaganda, a goodly amount of which is *much* more likely to drive people away than to make the average person reconsider.

Yes, there is a small but not infinitesimal chance that this might do some good. I hope, but don't necessarily believe, that socialists of all stripes might actually *want* to spread their ideas and don't depend on 'conversion experiences' such that other people will accept their views all in a lump like St. Paul on the way to Damascus. It's better and far more likely to change opinions bit by bit. I *know* that certain purist rhetoric drives people away in huge numbers, and I also hope that if it is unlikely that people of different views might visit a site such as r/socialism that people would have enough common sense to understand that this is a **bad thing** that should be changed and nothing to be proud of. I *did* post the item in other places as well by the way.

 




 There's a benefit from learning *any* language even if you aren't fluent in them. Simply knowing words or phrases or grammar points can open your mind and allow you to see many things more clearly. 




 It may be predictable, but it is also a 'spanner in the works' for some people who are great believers in St. Obama. 






















































 Thank you very much for the reference to the very interesting blog that you included. It is greatly appreciated. 




 Divine intervention ? 




 There will, of course, be a spike in inflation in terms of imported goods. Despite its own difficulties Russia is likely to offer Greece a deal on energy so that will be a deflationary impulse. On the other hand there is sure to be some stockpiling on the part of the population so that is inflationary. The effect on the tourist industry will likely be deflationary as businesses chase a declining tourist dollar. The ups and downs go on and on. I subscribe to releases from the IMF, but they have so far not hazarded a guess. I suppose there are other forecasts, but I can't refer you to any specifics. 




 Probably. I would never shop in a place like that and neither would most of the people I meet on a day-to-day basis. Its clientele comes from a rather higher socioeconomic level. Still, it's nice to see it in print. 




 Funny ? 




 Actually Zinoviev who put the opposition at a higher number. Also from the realism displaced at both the 10th Congress of the Bolsheviks/Communists and Lenin's own statements. You live in a small world where legitimate scholarly work is denigrated as propaganda against an archaic view. 




 No. The fight against IS is likely to be long and drawn out. Given Turkey's recent complicity in the attack on Kobane the open question is when the USA will decide to 'go rat' on the Kurds. In the end the USA values the Turkish alliance infinitely more than any friendship with the Kurds. The USA will probably delay until they are good and certain that IS is defeated. 




 At least no lives were lost in this latest failure. 




 To my knowledge the USA is close to being unique in the world in this regard. Even in France where language purity is along established tradition foreign languages don't evoke anywhere near this sort of hostility. Perhaps Turkey may be comparable in regards to at least Kurdish and Armenian.  




 Yes, I believe that's a correct reading. 




 Never mind. The hierarchy of Mexico recently carried out an exorcism of the whole country because of the 'demonic possession' of having a majority disagree with a certain Church doctrine. 




 Probably true. I'm agnostic about the point. If you define sociopathy as a 'mental illness' the work on prison populations would say otherwise. You can be well assured that there will be an attempt to expand this category to include as many unemployed people as possible. I suspect that there are some conditions defined as 'mental illnesses' either now, in the past or yet to come that would result in a person being **less prone** to violence. These would be of the 'paralyzing kind' that preclude a wide spectrum of action.

The point the spokeswoman for Mental Health Resistance was making is a fairly simple one. People who are **upset** are more likely to become violent, or in this case possibly become the victims of violence. She may have chosen her words poorly, but the context makes it clear what she was saying. 




 I think it will be their income that will be tracked rather than expenses. The experiment has been run before, and a particularly successful trial was in the town of Thompson (I think - memory can be fallible), Manitoba, Canada. If I remember correctly it ran for over a decade. Once more I'll have to check. Get back to you on this. 




 Actually not. The word 'communism' had a meaning long before the birth of post-modernist fashion, and it will have a meaning long after said fashion is consigned to the same archives in which Thomist philosophy, Hegelianism, Christology, positivism and dozens of other 'new and brilliant insights' reside. It means an economic system wherein individuals and families contribute labor in common and take goods from a common stock. In  practice such systems have usually been administered by an authoritarian ruling class and with rather strict sanctions via social convention. The longest lasting example in historical times were the Jesuit Reductions of South America.

This economic system is quite (and obviously) separate from the modern states that have used 'communism' as an ideological justification. Those states are what is more commonly understood as "communist" in everyday speech. The actual original and economic meaning can be better gathered from reading say the Bible than from any Stalinist propaganda. 

Stalinist states have been "communist" in the same sense as the Holy Roman Empire was "Holy" and "Roman". They most certainly deserve to be demonized, and one of the authors you mention, Zizek, makes a very good and persistent effort at exorcising said demon. He did, after all, have the perspective given by having lived under one such class system.

The 'socialism' the author of the article is speaking about is not synonymous with communism. In actual fact pretty well *every* modern society, perhaps *every* society ever, has segments of its economy that are "communist". It couldn't function otherwise. The largest segment of our present economies happens within the bounds of family relations. Communism in the original sense is mostly about distribution. Socialism is about power relations in production.

Nope, I'm not searching for the word "communism" at all, and neither is the author. 




 As the author of the article makes plain **neither** is state capitalism/socialism controlled by a new ruling class embedded in said state. There are problems, of course, with simple economic democracy, and questions about relations with other workplaces and the community have to be worked out. That is a matter of future experimentation. State socialism/capitalism which the author has criticized has had its chance at said experimentation, and it has proven a dismal failure - as would be expected from a system that is obviously a rationale for a new ruling class, obvious to everyone but its believers and especially practitioners. 




 Well, that's quite orthodox. It's actually quite a common opinion amongst left communists. Leninists and Stalinists pay it lip service, but it has never been carried out in practice aside from the economic disaster of 'war communism' in the early years following 1917. That system, of course, depended on simple theft from the peasantry, and it was also very much a class system. It became increasingly so practically by the month. The new ruling class was embodied in the Bolshevik/Communist Party and it incorporated ex-workers and also not a few members of the old Tsarist bureaucracy.

Others may consider that the democratic side of equality ie a *real* abolition of classes or perhaps even the abolition of the *inevitable* outcome of inequality of authority - actual economic inequality in the distribution of goods by whatever system, market *or otherwise* to be more important. Still others may consider the division of society into order givers and order takers to be equally or more important than a simple abolition of the market. Especially as distribution in such a so-called 'communist' economy will, in any foreseeable future require a rationing system - by an 'incredible coincidence' administered by the order givers.

Now I'm not saying that such a 'communist' system is impossible. As a matter of fact one existed for about 150 years - the Jesuit Reductions of South America. In some ways these were quite admirable. They were certainly more humanitarian than the colonial regimes they were independent of and more so than their distant reflection in the Stalinist regimes of the 20th century. They even, aside from religion, preserved native cultures to the best of their ability. The ruling clerical class recruited its cadre from the natives at least as well as Stalinist regimes have done with their lip service to the workers. It must be admitted that the Jesuits were far and away less susceptible to personal corruption than Stalinist regimes have proven to be. Incredibly so !

Within the Reductions the economy was as 'non-commodified' as any idealist Marxist could ever desire. Money was only involved in trade with the outside world. Beyond family plots goods and necessities were allocated according to need - as determined by the ruling clerical class of course. It actually worked, and only ended due to the dissolution of the Jesuit Order by Papal decree. 

Have a look. It's what you want. Be aware that the Society of Jesus accepts novices in our time as well. If the abstract (and idealist) goal of abolishing commodity production is more important than the ~~idealist~~ real desire for equality both in terms of economics and authority then you have a very good model there. Maybe you can begin a campaign for the canonization of a St. Dzhugashvili. 




 True, that's the present consensus. The article is inaccurate in that regard. 




 I don't think the list was set up as a 'one to ten'. In any case note that the list comes from a larger website that presents a wide selection of other progressive Middle Eastern musicians. 




 I seem to recall that you're quite an admirer of Wolff's. Don't worry. You'll get there faster than me a lot of times in the future. 




 Poland is rather unique in the EU. Even Ireland has moved beyond the shadow of clerical power. 




 Look back at the article to see the context. The statement was made by an activist with Mental Health Resistance, a left wing mental health consumers group. You can look up their Facebook page. Now, the context. She noted that people visiting mental health centers often become quite upset, and that is a fact. She mentions the situation of people leaving their appointments in an upset state. Especially in a place where they may be pressured to work for nothing ie workfare. Think about this for a minute. Can fights break out as they pass through groups of other people upset for a different reason and not entirely familiar with the merged purpose of the center. Of course it can. It may not be 'politically correct' to say so, but it is factually correct. The interesting thing is that the aggression may begin from the regular unemployed and not necessarily the mentally ill. That is the only part she omitted.  




 Note that it's part of a larger site featuring progressive middle eastern musicians in general. 




 Maybe it was the source that people are voting for. The BBC (published today) has a lot of fans. 




 Thanks for the information. 




 On vice versa. To define being unemployed as being a mental illness. 




 Yes, except the destruction of soviet democracy occurred very much earlier than the rise of Stalin. There were numerous oppositions within the Bolshevik Party itself against the progressively more hierarchical/dictatorial policies of the government during the first 4 years of the Bolshevik regime. The one that opposed Trotsky's plans to reinstitute the normal hierarchy of a regular army was called the 'Military Opposition'. At the Party Congress of 1919 their resolution against not just 'order givers' but also a class of officers who were to receive special privileges received 95 votes against 174 for the Trotsky/Sokolnikov plan. From this time forward 'recruitment' to the Red Army developed more and more towards conscription (kidnapping to the peasants involved). There were numerous other oppositions formed in the next 2 years, but in 1921 the fate of democracy in both the Bolshevik Party and Russia in general was sealed. The Bolsheviks had come to rule a country where they had defeated their organized opponents but where 90 to 95% of the population opposed them. NEP and the end of War Communism was the concession to this public opinion.

I can recommend a good book on this period of history. See Samuel Farber's 'Before Stalinism: The Rise and Fall of Soviet Democracy'. His case is basically airtight. As one article's title read 'Stalin didn't fall from the sky'. 




 The return of ranks in the Red Army, along with the destruction of the authority of the factory committees, then the unions and finally the soviets was *not* a neutral decision taken purely because of  'technical reasons'. It was very much a political decision, and it was opposed, ineffectively unfortunately, through each of its stages. 




 It's been done before in other cities, and yes, by its very nature, it is an experiment. So I agree. 




 A good source for regular environmental news from China is [China Dialogue](http://www.chinadialogue.net) . It is amazingly forthright for a mainland publication and well worth following. 




 The desks are next to each other or down the hall. If you've been observant when attending the offices of the 'helping' bureaucracies you will notice there is an "intake process". Little boxes are being checked indicating whether you will or will not become raw material of the 'production process' of various employees. All bureaucracies are the same. Their everyday work acts to both justify itself and to expand its field of operation whatever that may be. Effectiveness is usually not factored in at all unless some sort of scandal happens. 

For those who so far have escaped the label of 'mentally ill' the intake process by its very existence puts others in a position of deciding whether said label is to be applied or not. If none of the unemployed who don't bear the label didn't fit into the check boxes then the merging of the intake processes would be even more absurd than the usual government bureaucracy. It doesn't just 'insinuate'. It 'demands' that the boxes be checked. 

As to the larger world outside it is already a matter of discussion in some media about the 'character failings' of the unemployed. This merely adds fuel to the fire. 




 In Britain there have been programs that force people to work for various institutions, often NGOs *for no salary whatsoever*. There has been a lot of protest against this 'workfare'. If you were forced into that I don't think you'd be too happy. Similarly the way that 'job centres' work in most countries is that you God-damn better take what is offered/demanded. No begging off. Think about that for awhile.

As to the other unemployed workers who don't carry the label you may consider them 'privileged', and that, of course is your privilege to think as you wish. They, however, don't think it would be a 'privilege' to be so labeled. They, by the way, may be just as "hungry".

Sending the mentally ill to a 'job centre' is **not** so that they can be reassured that employers discriminate against them. It's so they can be forced to accept whatever a 'caring' bureaucracy feels or is told to feel is appropriate. 




 In Britain there was a move to place a mental health clinic in a government job center. Both the mental health workers and their clients protested *because* 1)it implied that unemployment itself was a sign of mental illness, 2)that unemployed people would be pressured to accept the label of 'mental illness' and 3)the mentally ill would be under further pressure to accept whatever job the employment center offered/forced on them. There are other reasons that the article explains. The last part is a sarcastic jibe at what is implied by this government move ie that the unemployed have "something wrong in the head or they wouldn't be unemployed". 

I'm sure that that wouldn't have fitted into the title box. 




 It looks interesting, and the price is not too outrageous. I wonder what shipping is though. Probably more than the book itself. What did you have to pay for shipping ? 




 I see. I guess those are legitimate beefs.  




 What did you dislike about it ? 




 Thanks. It's been a time since I have read anything on the dwarf planets, and Haumea was quite interesting when I looked it up. 




 Isn't it always that way ? 




 The IWW *definitely* wouldn't endorse Sanders or any other political candidate. It's one of their fundamental principles that union action and organization shouldn't be mixed with partisan politics of any sort. 




 My mistake. The proper term is "oblate spheroid". It's flattened at *both* poles, not just the north one.  




 Only "more or less" spherical. Consider Earth's 'pear shape' and its equatorial bulge. 




 Vers le bas avec la dictature des microbes. 




 I think Felis domesticus and Canis familiaris are going to be very upset when they find out there are prior claims to domesticated humans. 




 It's government contracting. In that world if you pay a dollar for a toothpick you haven't looked for the 'best toothpick'. 




 Yes, but the molecular clock has its own problems in terms of choice of gene/protein and therefore calibration. To a large extent people have relied on ribosomal RNA for comparing organisms. 




 I think that's generally true. The fat soluble vitamins (A,D and E) are the ones most susceptible to overdose. There are, however, exceptions to this, and people can be surprisingly creative in finding ways of getting themselves into trouble. 




 That congregation has the most incredible history. Thanks for the post. 




 I believe the article discussed the use of cyanocobalamin (B12) for actual medical conditions and at reasonable doses. It's particularly indicated in a lot of elderly people. 




 Thank you. 




 Thanks. I wonder what the scale in the photograph would be. 




 Yes, that may come to be due market mechanisms. 




 No, it's aliens girls. 




 I think that such plans are discussed quite frequently. One big roadblock I can see is economic viability. It wouldn't be economically feasible to mine iron in this way. Maybe if there were bodies that held significant amounts of 'rare earths' outside of Earth. 




 :) The 'War of the Spots' ? HG Wells returns. 




 I see. That holds water. There is still something, however, that I'd question. Are you perhaps 'begging the question' by initially assuming that one of the propositions *has* to be false ? 




 The dependence of production on a group of consumers wealthy enough to purchase their products has a lot to say for it, and is actually a fundamental belief of most modern economics. Its greatest proof in practice is (was ?) the Keynesian policies that guide modern states' economic policies. Quite frankly I can't answer your question in any certain way. All that I can say is that history has shown that states *can* exist for at least some time with different ways of managing production and distribution other than the controlled market that most of the world operates under today. I don't think that state socialism ala the former Communist countries exhausts all the possibility.

A long time ago I read a book titled 'The Disposal of Surplus Population in Managerial Society'. I've been trying to acquire a copy for some yaers now. Grim ? Yes. 




 Yes, it can be interesting up to the point of fascinating. Trying to figure out who might have written such a thing and why can be a real head-scratcher. I don't think it's a google translate, at least from any language I am familiar with. I'd go with a stream of consciousness free association, penned for a reason I can't comprehend. 




 Oh my God. I wonder what the poetry means if anything. 




 For those interested in following events in China here are a few sources:

3)Free China Feminists http://facebook.com/chinesefeminists (Concerning Chinese feminists recently arrested and prosecuted for feminist protests in China) 




 I presume there were crop losses in Ukraine as well. 




 In terms of 'surgeon' it may be further broken down. You note that ordinary doctors and nurses don't score so high on psychopathy. I'd lay bets that orthopedic surgeons top the list.  




 A little while ago I read an article saying that the constraints on physical constants in other universes may not be so strict in terms of ruling out life as some have thought. Damned if I can remember the article's title, but I'll try and find it. 




 Interesting. I'm sure the Fermi paradox has lots of holes in it, and you have pointed that out. Time travel, however, seems to have such a paradox in it via the old "kill your grandparents" story. What do you think of that thought experiment ? 




 He'll come running at top speed. 




 You are right. There has been a lot of international discussion on the subject but so far no really firm plans. 




 OK. You brightened my day. 




 Thanks. 




 And their own benefit as well. 




 Yes, that's a very important part of the report, and it is something to note. 




 Short, sweet and to the point. :) 




 Thanks for the link. 




 Both points are valid even though it comes to my mind that wind power is actually quite an ancient technology. Even so a little good news is better than none. 




 In the morning light I see what you mean. 




 Indeed. Looking over the offending sentence I'd say that it would have to be totally rewritten. It's beyond simple word substitution. 




 That would be an extremely good idea economically, but it's impossible politically. 




 How so ? I have to confess that the first thing that comes to my mind is that if China is a "communist-capitalist" apocalypse then Canada must be a "capitalist-communist" one. Sorry. It's late at night. 




 Sit back in your chair. It's time for a lecture here. Are you ready ? Steven Pinker is *Jewish*. Let me repeat that. Steven Pinker is *Jewish*. He was born to parents in the Jewish community of Montral. You can easily verify this by any biography about him. The only way he is not Jewish is the same way I am not Catholic. He says he became an atheist at the age of 13. I didn't do that until I was 15, but I guess Pinker is just smarter than me. He remained and perhaps still remains very much a 'cultural Jew'.

Here's the lecture part. A lot of people who are on what passes for a 'left' in the USA immediately reach for a political correctness clich in lieu of having any sensible arguments. I have seen that a lot of the 'cultural studies' left in the USA have been told to hate people like Pinker because there is a popular (in restricted circles) belief that his views are somehow, in a rather mystical way actually, supporting the social structures they oppose.

Now I don't know your views on Pinker's scientific work, but if you are of the 'cultural studies left' I hope you keep this incident in mind. PC clichs are not arguments. In fact they are very much neurotoxic. They destroy the brain cells that American leftists very much need if they are ever going to build an effective left in the USA. If you are not in the PC left ballpark then this is merely a bit of correction. Wanna hear some 'Catholic stereotypes' ? 




 Yes. The authors had a poor choice of words there. 




 Looks like an incredibly comprehensive list. I wasn't aware that Christie had been keeping up his film projects since the end of his TV channel. 




 You might say that he is now no longer "fashionable". 




 I'm fairly confident that there'd be something comparable for amphibians considering all the press they've received over the past few decades. The [International Union for Conservation of Nature](http://www.iucn.org) maintains what they call a 'Red List' of species at risk. It includes plants and a few fungi, but it mostly concentrates on animals. I don't know if this will be of any use, but have a look. 




 Well yes there are socioeconomic factors that make certain people in India particularly vulnerable. That's a given in any system that is highly unequal. These sorts of problems are not unique to India. I recently read an analysis of the heat wave deaths during one episode in *France* a few years ago. The inequality in India just happens to be particularly glaring. It's something like the effects of an earthquake. Think Nepal recently or the comparison between earthquakes in Chile and Haiti a few years ago. Socioeconomic factors and poor planning certainly contributed to the death and damage toll, but the immediate cause *was* an earthquake. The factors that make a society vulnerable always have to be kept in mind, but they don't abolish other causes.

 




 Apparently so, but I'm not really up to date on that. 




 My God. It seems that my ass is capable of at least kindergarten reasoning in pointing out the obvious. That's one smart ass. 




 Yep. You are the second person who noticed this. Of the 4 'rocky planets' only Earth is *known* to harbor life. Mercury and Venus definitely do not. Mars is still an open question, and only time will tell. I can remember two times of 'great excitement' about that. One was a report of 'organic structures' in a Martian meteorite found in Antarctica. The second was the first chemistry reports from one of the landers finding supposed metabolism from a Martian soil sample. Both failed to hold up on further scrutiny. The question is however still open as you note. 




 Yes, governments can be inconsistent.  




 Yes. The latest news is that he has been fired. You might say that the spin doctors performed an amputation. Given the pictures of him I've seen I suspect he will soon have to settle for a lesser degree of sartorial display. 




 The usual sources say 97 to 98 **or more** given uncertainty. The "or more" is always there. Here's a couple of the usual sources - [NASA](http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus). NASA also lists the 18 American scientific societies and 200 international societies that publically endorse the anthropogenic causation of global warming. The [Skeptical Science](http://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus-intermediate.htm) site also has a goodly number of links. They quote a figure of "97 to 98 % **or more**'" even though their survey of published peer reviewed papers **couldn't find one single paper dissenting from the consensus in the period of 1993 to 2003**. In science there is always an allowance for error.

A better and more comprehensive survey was carried out by geochemist [James Lawrence Powell](http://www.jamespowell.org). In a survey of 13,950 papers from 1991 to 2012 he found 24 that deviated from the consensus. This is a consensus of **99.83%**. Things progress. In his survey of 10,883 papers published in 2013 (he expanded his search) he found **2** that dissented from the consensus. This is a consensus rate of **99.987%**.

The consensus is pretty well universal and has been so for many years. What amazes me is the level of hostility and anger displayed by many of the deniers. You'd think all these scientists, their societies, worldwide government agencies and other international bodies were involved in a gigantic conspiracy to murder their beloved grandmother.   




 Indeed. But Mars is far enough out that the craft doesn't get (solar)winded. 




 That's true. The crucial thing about greenhouse gases is that their effects are *automatically* world wide. India's incredible pollution problems are a separate subject from climate change. At the same time I sure wouldn't pick Delhi as my favourite place to live. 




 Finally, real irony. Thanks. it lightens the mood. 




 El Nios and La Ninas are not a matter of one year on and one off. The present El Nio is still developing. The future does not cause the present. 




 Two points that you try to dodge with sarcasm:

1)The big one is that the El Nio you are trying to blame isn't fully developed yet.

2)The main financial interest in this debate lies with the fossil fuel industry. As to any conflict of interest amongst the 97% or 99% of reputable scientists who can recognize reality I doubt if their total salaries equal 10 million, let alone 100 billion. I gather the 100 billion sum includes every manufacturer of any renewable energy plant in the whole world. The conspiracy thickens.

As to your rhetoric it is as childish as that of a **very** small number amongst the the billions of people who can recognize a reality that triggers an emotional reaction in you.

Please check your great hero and victim hat at the door when you leave the room. The only "camp" you need is a summer camp that teaches manners. 




 I guess that 99% of the world's scientists, climatologists, geologists, meteorologists, etc. are *on the take* along with the scientific societies and the countries and international organizations that they work for. Conversely the small number of climate change deniers hired by the fossil fuel industry are obviously the very soul of objectivity.

Now, to speak to the specific question of drought in India. The **yet to fully develop** El Nio may have something to do with the temperatures and drought if one holds that the future can determine the present. Even if El Nio *was* fully developed you should consider the analogy of the eight ounce glass. Call El Nio two ounces to be poured in. Without climate change the glass holds 5 ounces. Pour in El Nio and the glass holds the full amount. If, however, with climate change the glass has 7 ounces there's a big mess when you pour in the 2 ounces of El Nio.

Every single weather event always has a number of contributing factors -always. You cannot 'prove', however, that one factor doesn't count just by noting that there are others working as well especially if the others are yet to come. 




 I wonder how long it will take for him to want to sell the suit *cheap*. I'm in the market whenever it happens. 




 That's good to hear if true. If it is I'm sure he can get a job come Christmas time playing Scrooge in Christmas pageants. 

I just had a look at the photo in your link. Looks like he'll have to adjust to a bit lower sartorial style in the future.  




 Yes, I keep seeing news stories about this. The air pollution in Delhi seems to be especially frequent. 




 One other thing about the exec in question. He should 'definitely' be spoken to about him and alcohol. I liked the pun by the way. Good one. 




 Yes, very culty and also absurd. It does an incredible amount of damage. Even if it is pretty obvious that it is 99.999% pure bullshit and chest beating it can take on an air of so-called 'reality' to people unacquainted with the level of illusion on the internet. It serves a few other functions as well. One is that it is incredibly useful for information gathering on the part of domestic spy agencies. Every fool who mindlessly shouts out their approval for a silly piece of bragging is automatically added to a surveillance list. What is more all people in contact with them are correlated as well. Gotta keep those lists up to date. 

Another thing is that such foolish diarrhea of the mouth is actually 'evidence for the prosecution' in future trials. This simple common sense fact is beyond the imagination of those whose idea of 'politics' is an opportunity to get their aggression out in a forum where they have an illusion of anonymity. 

There are other practical considerations as well, and behind them all lurks a cosmic sized fact. Nothing can be accomplished with childish displays of identity and hostility. It leads nowhere. Actually creating something requires totally different thought and action. Slow and steady reaches the destination. 




 Welcome. I had a quick look at your subreddit and subscribed. I see you're just starting out, but I hope you'll grow. My own tastes run towards reports of actual actions and especially organization that is making a concrete difference in the real world. I notice some articles of that type in your sub. The one about Masai women and solar power stood out in my mind. Feel free to crosspost here especially stories of that type. Do use "cross post from r/worldfeminism" in brackets. Take care. 




 Very good.  




 You're welcome. 




 I don't think that the J. Crew crew were *not* upset. The reason *why* they were and what they intend to do about it, however, are an entirely different matter.  




 The 'problem' could be stated this way: terrorist attacks motivated by right wing views were at least an order of magnitude more frequent than those coming from the left or from Islamists *before 9-11*. After 9-11 this remains the same. If the 9-11 policies were aimed at preventing the most common terrorist attacks then they are an obvious failure. 

Another thing to take into account in relation to 9-11 is to look at like it was a football series. One team wearing black hats got lucky *once* and won big. May I suggest that it wasn't and isn't that the guys in the white hats are so good but rather that the other side is so bad. All this is, of course, concerning Islamist terrorist attacks *inside the USA*. *Outside* the USA Islamist terrorism chugs merrily along, and no reduction can be seen. The victims of this are overwhelmingly other Muslims. If 9-11 had been prevented (as similar plots were in France) the 'top dog' of terrorist atrocities in the USA would have been the Oklahoma City bombing.

No I don't think 9-11 policies have been effective at all, but that was only *one* of the reasons they were brought into being. 




 That's undoubtedly the sad truth. 




 It should be noted that the list was last updated in 2005. A good number of the items listed no longer exist. I'm afraid that there is no more current listing that I know of. 




 I have a hard time understanding your points. Your first paragraph seems to be saying that I am advocating voting for Sanders which I am not. I wasn't advocating any such thing. I was describing a process that inevitably eats away at the hopes of any 'left-winger' who thinks they can push a slightly left-wing party further to the left by faction fighting within the party. These sorts of attempts are *far* more serious and sustained than a campaign around a particular candidate for leader, incredibly *far* more. This experience within a political party is actually far more 'democratic' than the 'football game fandom' of cheering on an individual leader whether in contests for leadership or in an actual election. They are to 'democracy' in the same way as a sustained series of any sort of events is to a 30 second blurb on the television.

Now I may have misread your intentions. I assumed that you were some sort of 'left-Democrat' who wished their party to be more connected to ordinary people and blamed the disconnect on a cabal of unsavoury manipulators within the party, blaming the personalities of the manipulators rather than the actual party structures that give them their power. 

I am most certainly *not* saying "democracy fails". In the case of a federal party in the USA nobody could say that with certainty because said parties have never been "democratic" (small d) to begin with. I *am* saying that there are other ways of political action that are much more worthy of the name "democracy".

As to your second paragraph saying that the movement is "towards money" is nothing more than saying "rightward" in different words. Moving "towards money" is nothing more than a gradual accommodation with possessors of power outside of the political game. 

American politics were not always as empty as they are today. Before they degenerated into the 'fandom' they are today there were *serious* parties contending for power such as the Populists, the Farmer-Labor Alliance and even the American Socialist Party. I leave the sectarian left out of this for good reason. Even today we have the American Green parties where the process of accommodation plays out as it does in social democratic and green parties elsewhere in the world.

So, hardly a "load of crap" unless you wish to maintain the illusion that dominates American politics today that personality is all that matters and that all that is required is that the 'good guys' get in and the 'bad guys' are removed. 




 My first thought is that if such a thing were possible it would still be ongoing. There is no evidence of such creation of matter in any of the black holes studied to date. 




 Once a political party becomes an established organization it develops certain 'levers of power' that are often (almost always) not explicitly stated and may in fact be invisible to 'outsiders'. The Democratic Party is no exception. Rather than discuss its complexes of influence let's take the case of pretty well *every* social democratic party in the whole world, from the Canadian NDP, to British and Australian Labour, to the French Socialist Party, to the SPD, to Greece's PASOK and so on and so forth. **All** of these parties began with a much clearer conception of socialism and an idea of fighting for the lower classes than the Democrats ever had. There was less compromise or collaboration if you will to begin with. In every last one of these cases the parties moved rightwards, especially rapidly if they gained power. In *all* these cases there were movements within the parties to 'reform' or 'return the party to its roots'. They *all* failed. *All* of these parties could be said to have much healthier 'roots' than the Democrats ever had.

It's an inevitable progression. The bureaucrats *always* outmaneuver the 'idealists', and if the idealistic reformer can't be ditched they are either marginalized or the 'Roman Solution' is applied ie "buy the barbarians off". It's a sad but inevitable process. 




 Possibly. Human politics versus baboon politics = We don't always follow the brightest ass. 




 Are there any online links ? 




 Yes that's true. My first thought is that the 'cores' that lead to active geology on such bodies aren't ionized like Earth's core. Or maybe it isn't cores at all but rather due to an equivalent to Earth's mantle. Or maybe the magnetic field of a moon is swamped by the much stronger one of a giant planet. Very puzzling in any case. 




 There has been a lot of violence, perpetrated by *both* sides in this long simmering dispute. The trouble is that the Chinese government can't see how acts of repression, sometimes quite petty, have exactly the opposite effect than the one they want. Petty repression will lead to *more* terrorism, not less. 




 Yes, the decree has its absurd implications. 




 Thank you. That was a wonderful essay. It explains a lot. 




 I think mining on Venus is still quite a distant project. 




 Apparently Venus has no magnetic field which certainly seems contradictory to its having active geology. There's a lot of mystery here. 




 Thanks for the link. 




 I think we're in good company. Black holes are an endless source of theories so I guess it's safe to say that nobody can claim a complete understanding. At one point the big question was whether they existed or not. When relativity and quantum mechanics are properly integrated then I'm sure things will be much clearer. 




 I'm afraid I am not capable of answering the question. You probably know more about the process than I do. I guess the best way is to have a look at actual holograms and the technology to produce them and then moving up from there. 




 I'm afraid that I can't explain it myself. I have read articles about the entire universe already being a hologram. It is moving so I presume one on the surface of a black hole would do likewise. 




 Yeah I know. My usual practice when I think a noun or an adjective are anything but their usual denotation is to put commas or quotation marks around the item in question. Sometimes I put a clarification within brackets after the item in question. I'm pretty sure, given the general orientation of the Guardian, that is merely a fault in writing style.  




 People can be strange quite often. From the way the author describes the hate mail it seems to be mostly coming from 'the left', or what passes for such. I can see how it could come from some segments of the anti-science right, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

The author says that the haters are angry that the money supposedly devoted to her 'de-extinctioning' could be better spent on other conservation projects instead. She points out that there is *no* active ongoing research on reviving extinct species in her lab, but people will hear what they want to hear. 

There are also anti-science beliefs common to the 'right' (think evolution, climate change and general environmentalism), and they are actually far more common than the anti-science of the 'left'. From my reading her angry critics are probably far more 'leftist' environmentalism.

There is, of course, the fact that some people can't seem to speak about anything at all without getting angry and offensive. With the internet such people have the whole world as their playground. 




 I believe the author was speaking ironically. It is, after all, from The Guardian, a paper not noted for its subservience to corporate designs. I agree the irony could have been better conveyed. 




 Well, I can only hope that there is enough noise about it that the State feels it expedient to take it down, even if only temporarily. 




 Yep. When they die they'll all be beatified immediately, and within two years it's canonization/sainthood for them all. The necessary miracle ? Well the whole world economy didn't circle the drain no matter what they did. 




 :) They'd also burn up from the inside out because they have a lump of coal where a heart should be. 




 Well I guess so. One thing argues against this though. I have it on good authority that there are no tax collectors on Venus. 




 The question is whether Venus is 'geologically dead' like Mars, the Moon or Mercury or active like the Earth. Surface temperature under a runaway greenhouse effect doesn't necessarily mean an active core or volcanos. 




 Whether it is the "only" one is arguable . Argentina went through a sovereign default in 2001 as did Russia in 1998. It could be argued that Russia and Argentina are not "developed" countries, but it is a grey area. 




 I realize that, but the usual use of a colon in print is for a subtitle. On the internet people will sometimes use it to add their own expansion to a title. If you use it to mock or disagree with either the title or the content of an article it is best to add some sort of 'irony mark'. In the text of an article in both print and internet this is usually done by bracketing the part you feel is bad by commas. In the title substitution you use it would have perhaps been a bit clearer if you had put a question mark behind the title or added some other indicator of irony. 




 I don't know. Loss of bathroom privileges perhaps ? 




 Optimism about immunotherapy has come and gone before. The difference today is that we are seeing it in the context of much greater basic knowledge. 




 You should have stuck with the article's original title. The title above leaves an impression that you are advocating for the bill. I know you aren't, but a quick glance would imply that you were. 




 There's a Japanese term for death by overwork, "karoshi".  




 Double thanks here. One is that you jolted my conscience awake, and reminded me that I should really get around to finishing part 4 of the translation. Another thanks for jolting my memory about your Bakunin library project. Very interesting.

Interesting article by the way. The old 'name dilemma' happens to almost every anarchist who has been active for long periods of time. At some point the disgust with some of the anti-social trends the movement attracts begins to gnaw. Trying to correct public misconceptions about the meaning of the word becomes even more difficult when there are 'comrades' who are overjoyed at promoting the worst labels imaginable and all the labels imply.

'Libertarian socialism' is the most common euphemism, and one I have often used. 'Libertarian communism' in its Spanish or French renderings is probably the most common. Prefixes such as "social" are probably the most popular in English. Implying, of course, that there is such a thing as "anti-social" anarchism which is unfortunately true. 




 I think your criticisms carry some weight. I'm going to have another look at the survey to see if I can find the exact form of the question. I follow Gallup and Pew, both of whom are fairly reputable, but I know there can be problems even with them. When I think about it there is yet another category to add to your list. I call them the "vagues". They pick this from one religion and that from another but basically don't take any of their "beliefs" too seriously. There's a lot of them. 




 Well it may be a bit off topic, but I think you might find the history of the Jesuit 'Reductions' in South America of interest. It is sometimes referred to by Latin Americans but rarely looked at in North America. These were 'colonies' of native people, centred on Paraguay but also in Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, run by the Jesuit Order and independent of the colonial authorities. Their economy was basically communistic with a small sector involved in individual production. They raised their on militia which was usually used to fight off slaver parties from the Portuguese colony in Brazil, but were sometimes called on to fight in other campaigns.

The 'reductions' certainly shouldn't be idealized. They were totalitarian far beyond modern examples such as Nazism or Stalinism. Everyday life was drastically regimented. The very highest authorities were also, of course, members of the Jesuits, but other officials were freely chosen from amongst the local people. What can be said of the Jesuits ho ran them - they were *far and away* more committed to a voluntary poverty that equalized their conditions with those they ruled than any modern ruling class has been. It's amazing what the fear of God can do.

Have a look. Modern liberation theology is not a direct descendant, but these experiments have at least an indirect effect today. 




 Looks like this is going to be a bit of a contest. Mammal (me) versus reptile. As with many **dozens** of other posts the one above was lifted probably via a bot from r/worldanarchism without either permission nor proper attribution.  




 As has happened **many** dozens of times the post above was acquitted from r/worldanarchism **without either permission nor proper attribution**. 




 ONCE MORE - The post above is a bot acquired copy from one posted * 9 minutes before this* in r/worldanarchism. It is, as usual, like many *dozens* of other examples reposted with neither permission nor attribution.  




 The above post, like many others, was copied from r/worldanarchism without permission or proper attribution.

 Maybe not from simple warnings, but there are other factors in play. 




 Its goal is to set a world's record every month. 




 The report is almost certainly true. The record says that totalitarian regimes often (though not always) attempt to cover up natural disasters. As for NK their policies have *never* worked, and I don't think their present failure is any more dramatic than at any other time. 




 OK, this has gone beyond ridiculous. There are no less than **nine** items posted on this single page which were originally posted at r/worldanarchism. They have been reposted here **word for word** except for the attribution to r/worldanarchism. It seems you have a bot that scans that subreddit and reposts things here. The time between the original posting has varied from a high of 1:49 hours to a low of **21 seconds**. Over the past months this has happened repeatedly, to the tune of **dozens** of items. I have already requested that you attribute your source if you wish to continue this practice, but there was no response on your part.

Now...you are totally free to do this with others items that I may post in different subreddits. In such cases I don't give a shit. The r/worldanarchism subreddit, however, is one that I wish to promote, and I do not appreciate what you are doing. I have little doubt that my case isn't the only one in which you engage in this behavior.

So... when I return to this tomorrow I hope to see that you have properly added your source in all nine posts that are presently visible on this page. You can leave the dozens of others alone. I would also hope that you will not behave in this way in the future.

 




 I have no idea why this, of all items, should be downvoted. It seems to me that 'Breaking the Silence' is a quite credible and admirable organization. The report stays on basic humanitarian territory, and I find it hard to imagine how anyone except a true believer in the eternal rightness of the Israeli government could object to it. 




 Actually the title of the article is misleading (but who am I to correct 'Nature' magazine). I was pretty nonplussed myself when I first saw it. The trick is that the treatment isn't really a vaccine at all. Mycobacterial preparations are non-specific immuno-stimulants. One of the earliest to be developed was BCG (Calmette-Guerin bacterium - an attenuated organism used in TB vaccines). There are numerous others, and some are in use for the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases.

The idea is that non-specific immune stimulation makes the organism less susceptible to inflammation  provoked by stress such as ptsd. Here's where the mystery comes for me. This increased potency must be directed at either aborting a response to pro-inflammatory molecules or in preventing the production of said molecules. I am puzzled by the 'hows' of this. I suspect the microbiome is somehow involved. 




 One problem I notice that the article doesn't discuss is the likelihood of colonization of Nicaragua's rivers and lakes by invasive species. This is not so much invasion from the oceans as species that travel along with the ships.  




 Thanks. I'll try to have a look at that. 




 Well I'll be damned. Thanks. 




 Thanks. I wasn't aware of that review. How far did it progress ? 




 That's a thought. 




 Actually he was a quite efficient bank robber. As to some other matters in his early career you wouldn't be aware of the debate about whether he was an Okhrana (Tsarist secret police) agent or not unless you were a student of Russian history. My opinion, for what it is worth, is "no", but I believe he did betray political rivals, both outside the Bolsheviks and inside, to the police for his own benefit. It's just an opinion, not a demonstrated fact. 




 Nope. It clicks through quite easily. There's something strange happening in the background here as per both your complaint and a strange notification from a bot. 




 Who was the other guy ? It skips my mind for the moment. Now I remember - Harpo, my favourite. This little exchange has the potential to equal the nonsense I see over at many 'anarchist' boards on Reddit. I **DON'T** include you in my 'silly list'. It is always good to be reminded that all the idiots and fools are not necessarily 'on my side'. 




 I guess so, but I am in a different position than you, being as I am much older and our social circles are probably totally different. Enough time on the internet has taught me the vague way that 'fedora' is used as an insult. The problem is that I rarely meet someone dressed up in such an uniform. As to 'Mountain Dew' I am totally at sea with that. Is this some sort of fad or is it yet another insult that is theoretically directed towards environmentalists.  




 You are living in a dream world. Nobody is pushing *anything* "down your throat" by voicing an opinion different from yours.  




 I guess I'm safe on at least some of this matter because I am personally not a believer in nor an 'advocate' of *revolution*. So that particular question is outside my own field of 'worry'. The point I was trying to make is that the date of the source you cited (1898) was a mere three years after the founding of the French CGT. Whatever one may say about anarchosyndicalism, pro or con, it has to be admitted that it was **THE** most popular and effective attempt at bringing the vague and often highly rhetorical ideas of anarchism into the world of actual effective action. 

Many anarchists argued against it or, like Malatesta, pointed out its limitations. As for M. it should be noted that in his final years he was perhaps just as much a gradualist as I am, and he certainly had abandoned the myth of the 'anarchist revolution'. To my mind anarchism is not like paleontology. Its history has to be useful rather than 'stamp collecting', and I think the debates at the turn of the 20th century have a lot to teach us today. It is indeed possible that Nettlau, as a very skilled historian, has a lot to say about the so-called 'revolution, and I am very happy to read the links you provided.

As for my own 'position' when pressed I call myself a 'mutualist', but that's only *when pressed*. I certainly don't agree with a lot of American mutualism. An example would be that I don't think the 'labor theory of value' is either true or useful. Neither do I think that the 'market' is anywhere near as magical as they do. My own mutualism harks back to the original French version with its emphasis on cooperatives, its gradualist approach and, yes, its belief in the efficacy of industrial combination ie syndicalism. This doesn't mean neglecting the communitarian aspects of anarchism, merely putting them in their proper place. That 'place' can't be determined by theory but only by practice.

Perhaps we agree on more than we can imagine though it seems that I am more "anti-revolution" than you. In any case I am in full battle mode now with a strange collection of 'Canadian internet conservative warriors' so I have to get back to that. Strange stuff. They sort of remind me of the cult that runs r/metanarchism. Change the names of the demons and you couldn't tell the difference, aside from the fact that there have been no threats yet. I'm sure it's coming. 




 I don't think here. I've met the CPC internet brigade before, and they are usually a cut above what I see happening here. I like the free advertising by the way. 




 Actually not. There are Marxists and there are Marxists, but I can't say that I resemble any of their schools. I'm afraid I don't feel up to trying (desperately) to educate you on all the various points of Marxism with which I disagree pretty well down the line. There are online resources where you can educate yourself, though I doubt you'll take the opportunity. 




 " Please remember, do not drink and text" - This has been a public service message from MADE, Mothers Against Drunk Email.  




 That is one strange bot. 




 The (mis)use is similar. Even though right wing forces often use 'junk science' or simply ignore science I don't think it has reached the level of Stalin's USSR. Yet... 




 "Trotskiest goose steppers" ?? That's a new one on me. I love replies like this. Whatever I may or may not know about science, even though I am not a "Trotskiest" I know something about the English language. The proper spelling would be "Trotsky*ist*". If you were one of their Stalin*ist* enemies it would be "Trotsky*ite*. As to the "goose-step" part personally I favor the "Bluebird Boogie", but to each their own. If I were doomed to "goose-step" I'd demand it be a "Canada goose-step".  




 Yes, I mentioned Nemesis in reply to another commentator. From what I remember the 'Nemesis Hypothesis' says that said 'intruder' returns at regular intervals. That being said the two theories are similar. 




 I'm not that familiar with her, but what I do know says that she is quite the reliable mouthpiece. 




 People have been working on it for some time, and here's an interesting fact. It's well known that the Canadian federal government has literally thousands of people employed to keep tabs on social media. Guess where these supposed 'ordinary citizens' defend their employer's plans. 




 It sort of reminds me of the 'Nemesis' hypothesis. 




 The term used in science literature is 'translational'. It is somewhere between basic and applied research. Many great programs are not readying research for the market but rather for other social needs. 




 Philae sends a high five from way out there. 




 Sounds like you're already very much on the trail of my impression. Once more I merely skimmed your last reference, but it seems to me that Nettlau was very pessimistic about the future of anarchism in the article you cited. I can see the guy's point. What I will say, however, is that the author wrote his essay at *precisely* the time that anarchosyndicalism was being formalized in France, giving a clear and definite alternative to the loony-bin politics of 'propaganda by the deed' which had poisoned anarchism for almost two decades.

Once more it's on the reading list. 




 I had never heard of him before today so I went and looked him up. It seems that he is mostly active in terms of campaigning against intellectual property. That's fine and good, and I'd probably agree with most of his points. What I *didn't* find, however, was any indication of his views being connected to socialism of any sort nor any indication that whatever money he has collected has gone towards the building of any political network even in terms of his own concerns. Perhaps you can enlighten me as to his relevance to the subject at hand. 




 The reconstruction of dinosaur biophysics is a great field. I'm sorry that I haven't been following it as well as it deserves. 




 Though mercifully less so than the USA. At least in Canada it is pretty well 'snuck in' rather than loudly trumpeted as in the USA. 




 Indeed, and perhaps there are research proposals contained in your question.  




 It's a big step from bacteria to mammals. Myself, I don't know. 




 it seems to me that any such choice would be totally subjective, but I can see what you mean. Without a visible set point longitude is totally meaningless. Basically I don't know how. 




 Actually I realized that after I wrote the comment above, and it's true. If say I'd like the money to spend every last day of the rest of my life pissed to the gills until I finally expire with cirrhosis of the liver I wouldn't get very far with a kickstarter that told the truth. If, however, I were to raise money to supposedly feed hungry children I could merrily use all that money for alcohol (or, as actually happens, printing Bibles and demanding the kids recite verses before they got their soup).  So, true, point granted.

I do, however, stand by the statement that there is *no* 'after the day' plan to do anything when the 100% predictable loss happens. There is a big difference between throwing money at TV ads and actually having a remainder of active social democrat *activists* who will be about their business the Monday after the Friday Convention where Sanders will go over and shake Clinton's paw. Hopefully they won't hug and cheek kiss. As to the 'staying power' of whatever propaganda the Sanders campaign may kick out consider the following. How many of the tens of thousands of ads that a person is exposed to in the course of a year can be remembered a year afterwards ?

Please understand that despite my own anarchist viewpoint I don't have any great animosity towards social democrats. I'd like to see more of them. But... I also know one hell of a lot more about how such parties operate, having once been a member myself many decades ago. At some point I'd like there to be a viable social democratic party in the USA that was worth talking to, influencing and/or negotiating with in a truly cynical mindset/manner. The circus of a Presidential campaign with no planned follow-up does nothing to build such a party. 




 Think about the "wider narrative strategy" that you mention. Where on God's green Earth is it being hidden ? What might it be. After the inevitable happens and he loses the nomination what further plans have been are being or will be made to take advantage of the publicity generated ? I realize what might be done depends very much on how badly he loses, and I personally can't predict that. 

That, I'm afraid is the eternal problem with populist campaigns, of *both* the left and right, in American politics. Organizational alternatives are *never* put forward beyond vague feel-good statements. Here are a few names: Eugene McCarthy, George McGovern, Ralph Nader and every single Green Party candidate ever nominated. They all shared the same defect as Sanders' does. After the defeat all the supporters wandered off and were never asked to do anything beyond send more money. That is what will happen here as well.

Will his candidacy "force Hillary to the left" ? On a few days it will seem so as Clinton makes left wing noises to certain audiences. But then she will travel on to make different noises to different audiences. I'm sure that Clinton is a shrewd enough politician to know better than to *ever* make a substantive proposal when fine sounding rhetoric will do.

As Sanders' campaign progresses keep track of the money it has raised. As the total gets larger and larger start thinking about what else could have been done with that money. 

   




 Perhaps they will. It depends. Total capitulation would involve ending the occupation for a vague promise of a space sometime in the future. Partial capitulation would be accepting an offered space that was unsuitable for one or many reasons. From what I read here the occupiers seem fully aware of the 'trap' that negotiating with social democrats (the new Madrid administration) can become. 




 This looks like an interesting book. Thanks for posting. I haven't had time to read it all, but a quick scan through reminds me every much of Rocker's [Nationalism and Culture](http://libcom.org/library/nationalism-culture-rudolf-rocker). The date of publication of the latter was 1937. Nettlau's book dates from 1927. Seems Nettlau was perhaps an influence on Rocker. 




 Yes there are indeed problems with the Mondragon model, and their role as an employer which you point out is, in my opinion, the greatest one. 




 Thanks. The lists in that article are fascinating. 




 No, it's not frequent, but there have been other cases. 




 The point that struck me is that this is merely one of many such incidents. 




 That seems like a reasonable hypothesis to me. 




 Well, it's very much the same as a situation where you would want to stop a shipment of something from New York to Illinois. If you'd like to stop that you have opportunities at the borders of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana. That's what they are doing. To get from point a to point f you have to pass through points b, c, d and e. 





































































 yes, I enjoy this sort of thing as well even if I did leave the Church at 15. One of my favourites was the treasury of St. Marks in Venice. Incredibly rich, and it's interesting to contemplate that almost every object was acquired by theft. 









 I know there is a lot of tax-dodging, and many workers, especially migrant workers from the countryside, are employed in the black market. Where do the foreigners come into this ? Obviously there is something that I am in ignorance of. What countries do these people come from ? What sort of industries do they work in ? How do they pull it off. It seems the government would be hot on the trail of the lost tax money. 














 Old news granted. One thing struck me however. I guess that there are foreigners working *outside* of factories in China. Aren't a lot of them employees of multinationals ? Ho does Chinese legislation apply to them ? 
























 I guess that might sound contradictory.  






















































 Great source. There is another subreddit, r/anarchisthistoryporn , that bears a look. It is, of course, far less extensive than the Labadie collection's is. 










































































 Interesting essay. It's been a long time since I've read anything by Mattick. Without addressing the full article I have some doubts about the first part. The author seems to conflate the private views of Marx and Engels ("Progressive and reactionary nations", etc.) with the views and actions of the socialist and anarchist movement as a whole. I don't think that pre-WW1 social democratic parties acted in a way consistent with the views of Marx and Engels. 














 I'm afraid not. I believe they are from France, but beyond that I am unsure. 


































 I wouldn't be able to comment on members of police forces. I am sure it varies from time to time and place to place. As to the military I don't think there is a great difference from the normal population in general terms in countries where there is conscription. In places where there are voluntary armies I'd suspect that the greatest incentive is socioeconomic. Good idea or not a lot of people think the military is a way to "better their condition". 





























 I can hope so, though the 'lead-on' from this sort of thing certainly hasn't given birth to any great wave of 'what next' in most leftist places. 




 I certainly hope to in the last 100 years. Gives a new meaning to 'stinky goche'. 











































































































































 I recently read this, and I'm curious as to what others think'. The authors' explanation in the article  seems 'fishy'. Ammonites were in decline for some time before the K/T boundary, and I pretty well certain that no fish has ever occupied an ecological niche once occupied by ammonites. I am also doubtful that there were enough marine reptiles to account for the freeing up of niches or reducing predation pressure on fish. As to the latter the loss of reptile predation should have removed a selective pressure and led to *decreased* speciation. Finally, why do shark species remain more or less stable ?

 



























































 In 'New York Times speak' it does, and so unfortunately it does in most public discourse in the USA. How 'class' is spoken about varies from country to country and even within countries themselves. I would personally prefer the term "working class". In speaking to the average person I would truncate that to "workers' especially in the USA. The way "middle class" is used in America is quite unique. It actually seems very 'Mom and apple pie' when it comes out of the mouth of a politician, and I think it is like the use of the word "family" in a lot of cases ie without much content. I'd never use the term myself, but I am very much of a minority in this matter.

So, I actually agree with you, but the NYT is the NYT. The way in which the term is used in the USA would sound very strange in say Britain. Over there the 'Middle Class' doesn't carry the positive associations it does in NA. It is often used to describe people who in other countries would be called 'capitalists'. 




 Thanks. I've never heard that expression before, but it is a good one. 









 I don't know. I understand he is a fairly good amateur pianist. Not musician grade for sure. He won't be following in the steps of Glen Gould anytime soon, but it's still an accomplishment that I find praiseworthy. That rules out "complete". 




 I had to pick some word for the title. "Chart" seemed appropriate though I'm sure there are other words that could be used, some of them better than the one I chose. 









 If it was North America I might quip that keeping up one's clothing styles and proper vegan diet requires a fairly significant cash flow. Different thing in Greece though.

If almost certainly wasn't planned, but I would say it would have been brilliant if it was. The police, of course, are already on the highest alert possible. Starting a rumor of anarchists attacking ATM would be a work of genius. The mind boggles at the number of police officers necessary to properly protect all the ATMs in a large city. 












































 There is a more extensive [history](http://libcom.org/history-black-guards) of this subject at Libcom. That history also mentions one of the weaknesses of the Black Guards, if only to note that the Red Guards contained similar criminal elements. It was the refusal of the anarchists to disavow this minority element that gave the Bolsheviks their 'cover' for the suppression.  






















































 I'd tend to agree with you. There is a great tendency to try and define as much of normal behavior as some sort of "pathology". It keeps a very large industry humming away, and big-Pharma that people try and blame is only a minor part of it. 

I guess we are about the same age. Both my parents have been dead for some years as well. Take care, and my sympathy about their bad attitude. 



















 Sorry I messed up the link to dpac' s website. It's been corrected. In any case the event will be on Wednesday, July 8th at Downing Street. It is centred around "balls", as they say "big balls, small balls, footballs,...hairballs, beachballs, ...", a sort of festival atmosphere. Further details are under the 'Blog' section of the website, and there is a event page on Facebook http://www.facebook.com/events/1455266081436327 .

 My dear friend the late Anwar Sadat summed up people like you very well when he was describing Muhamar GaddhafiDuck. There is crazy. There is fucking crazy. Then there is "100% insane and possessed of the Devil". Keep counting your toes. You'll never know when the Illuminati may remove or add some because you are "in the know". 














 For some reason that seems to make a vague connection in my mind as well. I know there's been quite a bit written about their presence in temples there. I'm going to have a look. 















































































 OK you'll get what you want. The matter of "more than that" in terms of Zinoviev comes from a speech by Leon Trotsky against Zinoviev at the 10th Congress of the Bolsheviks/Communists as quoted by John Bunyan in 'The Origin of Forced Labor in the Soviet State 1917-1921', John Hopkins Press, 1967. Bunyan quotes Trotsky as saying that Zinoviev gave a number of **99%**. This is probably exaggerated by Trotsky though it is hard to judge for reasons I will be explaining below. Leonard Shapiro in 'The Russian Revolutions of 1917: The Origins of Modern Communism', Basic Books, New York, 1984 gave the quote as **90%**. Bunyan's quotation is more reputable, but I downgraded it because Trotsky, as a representative of the extreme right of the Bolsheviks at the time, was obviously partisan.

Here's the trick. Until some historian with a rather limited field of interest manages to dig the **real** minutes of the Congress out of the Soviet archives  rather than the falsified ones presented by the USSR government we won't know the exact number for sure. The Soviet government, of course, had no reason to preserve the words of Zinoviev himself. He was murdered one day after his 'trial' as part of the 'Trial of the Sixteen' on August 24 1936 to preserve the 'proletarian power' of the torturers and their bosses with dachas on the Black Sea. You don't preserve the words of so-called 'traitors' - especially if they are right.

Now here's the important point. It is not **my** scholarship. It is the scholarship **of the world**, at least that part of the world outside of a sect degenerated into a cult. I am not an academic. I am merely an ordinary person with an interest in Russian history, and just because I know far more than a true believer doesn't mean I am an expert in any sense.

If you wish to educate yourself beyond the realm of slogans I would suggest looking at 'The Russian Revolution and Civil War 1917 -1921: An Annotated Bibliography, Chapter 18`. The title of this chapter is `Popular Hostility to Soviet Rule`, and it runs from pages 334 to 340. Pages 337 and 338 are missing in the version available on the internet. 

It is hard for me to judge if your lack of knowledge is legitimate or a sophomoric debating tactic. In any case you can educate yourself in regards to any legitimate study of the economic history of the USSR. Start with Carr`s history of same. He makes a heroic effort to discern fact from the fantasy of Soviet `statistics`. You can then consult Lenin's own works which are, more or less, publically available in terms of the debate about the NEP as well as pretty well *every* legitimate study of the period that isn't special pleading for the developing new ruling class.

As I said, it is hard for me to determine if an American sectarian in the 21st century is really under the illusion that their world of so-called 'actual numbers' of public opinion surveys ever existed in other times or places or if this is, once more, sophomoric debating. In a country as per 1921 Russia where conquered areas such as the Caucasian republics and Central Asia were under military occupation and where large areas of the country such as the Tambov area were in open rebellion and where dissent could mean death there is no American leftist "actual number". Especially as the new ruling class was nowhere as developed as it was later in 'Stalin's war against the peasants' in the early 1930s.

In a situation where there was widespread opposition to the new ruling class amongst both the working class as evidenced by the strike waves of 1921 and *especially* the dozens of peasant uprisings the Bolsheviks had to repress there are no 'actual numbers', merely the use of poison gas to exterminate peasant rebels in the forests of Tambov.

Once more there is a world of real history, not "my" history, outside of the world you have decided to enclose yourself in. In comparison to your world the Catholic Church is honest. 









 As I said you are not a moderator. Your errors have been plainly pointed out, once more to the tune of 406,000.  Are you really so childish that you think that somebody will obey your orders just because you say so. Take it to the real moderators and stop your false fronts. Your habits of deception are pretty obvious.  If you don't want to be attacked 'personally' don't play act and make false arguments just because you think they are amusing. Others have a different concept of reality ie that there *is* a reality. 














 It is, of course, **not** "rehashing the other story that it quoted as is plain from the text. It obviously added to it and presented its own perspective. The whole context as pointed out to you to the tune of the 406,000 previous references is pretty obvious, and your claim of 'originality' for the source you quoted is absurd. The facts are obvious as I have pointed out. Your claim as to originality is not connected to reality.

I have to admit you had me going for a little while. At the first I thought you were some sort of monitor of this subreddit as you seemed to imply. Just like I thought you were somebody from Oklahoma familiar with the story in question rather than an argumentative Canadian. You, of course, are not either one. I forgot the level of deception common on reddit. 

Then I checked your comment history. At the first it seemed like you were part of the Bugs Bunny Political Correctness Brigade. Then I went further and you were nothing more than an ordinary right winger. Given the mentality of both reddit  marching columns I have little doubt that you can be both at the same time.

Seems like you are just somebody who likes to argue and provoke. Trust me. It is gone when you are 25 for well over 99% of the population. 

Believe it or not there are adults in this world who take opinions seriously. Hopefully you will eventually grow into that. 





























 I checked. The 'Oklahoma's Own' article is as much an 'primary source' as the 'Alternet' one is. This has been an ongoing story that has been reported in *hundreds/thousands* of sources and dates back to 2014 or earlier. The reports of the passing of the Bill date back to February 2015. A Google search of the story shows... 407,000 hits ! I'm afraid that the 'Oklahoma's Own' story is certainly not 'primary' is any sense either temporal or in terms of content. It is very much a 'public domain' matter where 407,000 people, not all unique granted, have commented for over a year. I think you should revise your opinion. The 'Oklahoma's Own' story is only 'primary in the same sense that a report on a Presidential speech repeated in 100,000s of places is primary because it was filed 2 seconds before others. Less so actually as the story you mention was predated by tens of thousands of others.

OK you are entitled to your opinion, but in my view your opinion is 'grossly' inaccurate to the tune of hundreds of thousands. Can you point to *any* unique matter that was posted in 'Oklahoma's Own' that was not mentioned thousands of times before and which 'Alternet' can be accused of copying without attribution ?

Just as an incidental point as neither 'Alternet' nor 'Oklahoma's Own' can claim to be "original" what infinitesimal percent of news stories either in print or on the internet can claim to be truly "original" ?  I'm sure that a lot of local news actually is, but for anything outside of that I think a thousandth of a percent may be an overestimate.  









 I don't think so. First of all neither the 'Alternet' source nor the 'Oklahoma's Own' source are blogs, and I am certainly not connected with either one. Second of all the 'Alternet' source is *not a copy of the news story that appeared in Oklahoma's Own'*. It is a rewrite, and I'm sure that somebody connected to the original *could* complain about the lack of attribution. You have to understand that the audience of the two sources are not comparable at all, probably to the tune of 1000 to one. A general reader like myself is much more likely to encounter the story on 'Alternet' than elsewhere. Also, did it appear in *other* more local sources as well ? I'll try and check.

You may have cause for complaint about AlterNet's policies, and I can appreciate your concerns. Perhaps you should take it up with their editors. 














 Indeed. As I said to another commentator on a different place: I definitely would never shop in such a place myself, and neither would anyone with whom I come in contact with on a day to day basis. The clientele of such places tend to be of a higher socioeconomic status. Personally I live in what might be described as an unfashionable mid-working class neighbourhood. In the town here I live the highest proportion of customers of such places would be in the two neighbourhoods known as 'Hippy Heaven' (where good hippies go when they die) and 'Trendy Town'. I'm sure there is lesser but still a fairly high concentration out in the suburbs as well. Perhaps I get carried away with the snark at the pretentiousness of pseudo-progressives sometimes, but I have to get my little dig in now and then.

There are, by the way, labor issues connected to Whole Foods (Hole Foods ?) as well, but I can't write a manifesto for everything. 









 Ok. Sorry about the mistake. 




 It depends on what you consider anarchism to be. If you think that it involves the continuation of the commitment of the vast majority of the movement to rational thought then it is one more brick in the edifice against 'mystical belief' in some vague idea of natural. If you hold to the traditional belief of the vast majority of the movement in the exploitative nature of the market then you should be right at home with this little further tidbit. As I said, it all depends on how you conceive certain things that the worldwide movement has always held to and still holds today. I admit it is trivial, but most of the world is trivial.
