 If she was a White man who did this she would have been fired by now. That is all that anyone needs to know and the double standard shows you how the Left wing scum running the liberal arts institutions in America are taking over and they're winning because our media is garbage and won't call them out. News reports about this story aren't calling her out; they are merely reporting on the facts. When the media creates the narrative that people like this have been festering and taking over liberal arts departments in academia in the Western world for decades then I'll be satisfied.

 [The thread in /r/CFB about Manti T'eo's fake girlfriend](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/16pi4a/deadspin_manti_teos_dead_girlfriend_the_most/) being exposed might be one of my favorite reddit threads of all-time. The hilarity contained within those comment threads was truly astonishing. This guy's comment from the thread sums it up perfectly. 

 This comment will undoubtedly get buried but I feel compelled to voice my opinion nonetheless.

Watching this story break and unfold over the last hour in this comments thread is what I love MOST about the Reddit experience. From the initial link, to the ensuing denial from ND fans and Te'o supporters, the speculation, the reaction .gifs, and then the real time links to ND's statement - I have never had quite such an intriguing social networking experience in my almost 20 years of using the internet.

All credit goes to DeadSpin for breaking the story but I'll always remember reading these comments in real time as the story was breaking as a truly unparalleled experience in the ever developing social network medium.

 Yeah, but it bashes views that reddit feels are held by fat redneck Republicans so the stupid post stays and will frontpage. The wise teenage liberals of reddit probably are cool with ~~their tax dollars~~ their parents' tax dollars putting illegals through college when many American citizens - not illegal Hispanics - can't even afford college themselves and need to scrounge tirelessly for an education.

 I love how reddit's wise teenage liberals think that all of the illegal Hispanic immigrants pouring over our wide open borders are hardworking.

  The discussion quality on TiA has been horrendous. It's easily one of the biggest circle jerks on reddit.

The sub consists almost entirely of image posts because the mods don't allow self posts. I'm not sure what anyone would expect discussion-wise when this is the case. Sometimes articles are posted to TIA and there is good discussion but those posts are in the minority. If the mods want better discussion then they should allow self-posts but they don't want that. We see self-posts in this sub all the time and there is better discussion so I don't see why we can't have that in TIA. The mods just don't want it. This wasn't always the case there.

 Yeah but girls don't have the societal and necessary impetus to approach men to get any sort of romantic or sexual gratification started like in a bar or a club. Very few girls like you described exist and behave that way. There are more than a few unattractive guys that behave in an awkward and uncool manner but feel the need to try to engage because both society and women put that burden on nearly all males, both attractive and unattractive alike. It just so happens that the former has to do it a little bit less while the latter has to engage with women 99 percent of the time if they want anything to happen. Most of the time this doesn't end well for them while most of the time it ends well for attractive men. 

It's much easier to get labeled as a creep if you're a man who fucks up socially in romantic situations than it is for a woman to be labeled the same.

 I found some more information about this story that is pretty interesting. I've redacted both personal and identifying information, just to be safe with the mods of this sub.

They've let wholeinabucket's comment stand even though he named the boy but I'm not sure if the mods will remove the comment for personal info if and when they see it. This boy killed himself in 1999.

 At one of the largest high schools in North
 Texas, a single gunshot brought grief and shock to students and parents.
 Classes had barely begun Thursday morning at Richland High School in
 North Richland Hills when a young student, described as a loner,
 took his own life. School administrators scrambled to keep school open,
 but many students went home for the day. It happened right after the
 morning bell in a bathroom right off the main lobby. Sophomore [John Doe]
 walked into a stall, pulled out a nine-millimeter pistol, and shot
 himself, once in the head. The student was rushed to a nearby hospital
 where he was pronounced dead.
 
 Freshman [redacted] said, You hear girls crying. Its so sad.
 So sad, people we go to school with. So sad... As news of the tragedy
 spread, anxious parents showed up to claim their children. Some worried
 about how easy it is to bring a gun inside a school with no metal
 detectors. [redacted] is a parent. Theres a firearm in the school.
 Regardless of whether he took his own life or someone elses life, there
 was a gun in the school. School officials say there hasnt been much
 trouble at the school before.
 
 [redacted] is with the Birdville ISD. Im sure this will be
 reviewed. This has not been an issue. Its sort of a fine line you walk,
 do you want metal detectors at all entrances of a high school facility.
 Or is this an isolated incident.
 
 NBC Fives [redacted] reports that police werent the only ones at the
 school after the shooting. About a dozen counselors and volunteer
 chaplains were on hand to help students cope with what happened.
 Theyre meeting one on one and in small groups, talking about the
 tragedy and trying to prevent another one. Reverend [redacted] said,
 Its a big concern because to a lot of young people its a viable
 option. And of course, were telling them its not a viable option. Life
 is worth living. There are people who will help you and love you. The
 pastor says the student who killed himself, [John Doe], had no
 trouble with drugs or girlfriends. But he also says the teenager wrote
 some 8 to 10 letters to friends on Wednesday, which have now been given
 to police.
 
 The ordeal shook up other students who didnt even know the boy, who
 wonder what could have gone so wrong? One student who knew [John Doe]
 described him as being very depressed. The student said [John Doe] never
 played with the other students in gym class.

 Diary of a cult member

 By [redacted]
 
 NORTH TEXAS - 16-year-old [John Doe] committed suicide Thursday at
 his high school. Journals he left behind indicate a confused young man
 torn between a dangerous cult and doing what was right. They give a
 frightening look into the world of a teenager who took his own life.
 
 [His parents] say they had no idea their son was so
 torn up inside, not until he killed himself and left behind personal
 notes and a journal describing every day of his life for the past year.
 [His father] says, He was extremely confused. He was being bombarded with
 questions in his head, Whats right, whats wrong, what do I believe,
 what am I doing, what should I do next.
 
 Through words and pictures, [John Doe] described his involvement with a
 so-called Wiccan Cult. The beliefs were far from the traditional Wiccan
 Religion, whose members practice white magic, and encourage harmony with
 nature. His dad says, Its contorted and deformed the way theyve done
 it. Theres nothing good about it. The Wiccan Religion was of good
 things that you can do and anyone that would do evil with it was not
 accepted and they were cast out.
 
 [John Doe], too, was apparently cast out of his group once members realized
 his true intentions, to help others get out. His father found a
 disturbing letter filled with threats from a fellow cult member. [The father]
 says the letter said, We will join together against you, your Catholic,
 anti-atheist group. The letter went on to describe how [John Doe's]
 deviation from the cult would result in a so-called dreamscape trial.
 [John Doe's] step-mom [redacted] says, Entering and attacking a person
 through their dreams. They quote, unquote, kind of call it a dreamscape
 and even if the person doesnt want to participate they can still do
 it.
 
 [John Doe's] journal also described the study of two books: The
 Necrinomicon, or The Book of the Dead, and The Satanic Bible. Some cult
 experts say whatever his intentions, [John Doe] was simply messing with
 something way too dangerous. [redacted] of Watchman Fellowship, Inc.
 says, Theres a lot more to it than maybe they initially believe.
 Rather than just an innocuous investigation or morbid curiosity, they
 actually find themselves being drawn into the lifestyle. A lot of times
 the quest for personal power becomes overwhelming.
 
 Its advice too late for [John Doe], but information his parents hope
 will reach others whom may be lost and searching for answers. [John Doe]s
 family and friends gathered for his funeral in North Richland Hills on
 Monday. Pastor [redacted] told the congregation [John Doe] is now living
 peacefully in heaven.

 PLEASE HELP! That (now viral) video of the officer in McKinney subduing a girl in a bathing suit was in OUR neighborhood. The situation was NOT what is being reported
 
 A DJ setup in a public space next to the private pool in our neighborhood on Friday and played loud explicit (F-bomb) music for multiple hours (it is unclear if he was invited by a resident as no one has claimed responsibility). The teenagers (both black and white) were being brought into our neighborhood by the carload because the DJ was tweeting out invites to a pool party for $15 (obviously unauthorized by our neighborhood). The teens began fighting with each other and pushing their way into our private pool. Some were jumping our fence. The security guard was accosted when he tried to stop the beginnings of this mob scene. Some residents who live around the park/pool area tried to come out and settle things down. The teens started yelling racial slurs at our neighbors and started assaulting people and property (throwing bottles at cars and attacking a mother at the pool with 3 young children). The first officer on the scene was by himself. At that time, the party had grown to a large, aggressive crowd. As the officer arrived, many teens started running through our neighborhood. Many of the teens were being very aggressive and yelling at the officers as more arrived.
 
 This was a very dangerous situation for the officers AND the teens/residents not involved. The news media has refused to hear the neighborhoods side of this story. The video being distributed is only a very small segment of what happened. This information being distributed by the media and others is extremely distorted and in some cases outright lies.
 
 PLEASE HELP US STOP THE BROADCASTING OF THIS IGNORANCE. The media is trying to make it look like our neighborhood is a whites only, racist area. Anyone who has spent even a few minutes in our area knows this is an outright LIE.

That is the account of a McKinney, Texas local.

http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/06/08/412889290/texas-pool-party-update-teens-and-residents-speak-out

The person who wrote what I posted here is a resident of the pool's community and they sent this out to media outlets. The man even provides his name but I won't post that since it's personal information. 




  most

So some did not and the cops were called because they were trespassing.  



















  "Tresspasser" is just a codeword for a black person amongst inhospitable white folk.

No, it's code for people that trespassed by accosting the pool security guard and climbing over fences to get into the pool when the rules of the pool state that you're only allowed to bring in two other friends with you to the pool. Random people showed up to this pool after some DJ tweeted about it and they didn't have a right to be there. The residents heard all of the loud noise coming from the hip hop music that was blaring, saw all of these people that clearly weren't residents of that community flooding towards the pool, saw altercations and fighting going on and then called the cops. They were trespassing.

 most of whom clearly lived there

You just supported my point for me. Not all of them were welcome there. Most might have been. Some were not and the cops were called because they were trespassing. 

 their parents' HOA dues pay for

Some of them weren't from that community and neither were their parents so I don't know what you're talking about. Maybe try facts when you make points. 

 And as for the non-residents, black residents are entitled to have guests just like everyone else.

Yeah, only when they follow the rules which they didn't. Some were trespassing and those who weren't brought more than two friends to the pool which is against the pool rules. 
 




  but why did he feel the need to pull his gun out?

[Because he thought that someone there had a gun and was about to pull it out on him.](https://imgur.com/a/hDZ0N)  




 He committed a crime so he ended up in jail like he should have. He stole something and was jailed for it. The issue in his case was that he stayed in jail too long without a trial, not that he went to jail.  




  So it's the children's fault

Yup, they were the ones trespassing and who were asked to leave by both the community residents and the cops and failed to do either.

Lena Dunham sexually molested, groped, and masturbated next to her sleeping sister yet the media have little to say about her being a disgusting sexual abuser.

I think Palin is a retard but she does have a point and anyone who pays attention to the media knows that they have a liberal bias.
