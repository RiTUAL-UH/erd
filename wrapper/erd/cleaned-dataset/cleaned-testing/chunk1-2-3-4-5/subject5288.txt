 I drew a few drawings, and that's about it! 




 I am doing fine and I am very sleepy as it's almost 1am here :) What about you? 




 Hello! 




 Our Lord is testing your faith. Don't join the ugly shills at Cyanocorp. 




 5.5.0


Damn, you are futuristic. 




 Nope, no idea about it as I have never been there :( 









 Yes, it's similar in India! It's unbearably hot here, too. 




 It's 12am here and I turned 16 just now! Feels awesome :) 




 Naut 3 is a really good theme and it would make the sub look elegant. 









 I had been working on it since 4 hours and I made this app which doesn't do much! Feels great :) 














 Comcast= Literally Hitler


Hitler=  Approved Prophet


Therefore, Comcast is an Approved Company. 














 Just curious as many people don't seem to know about it. 









 Please be serious here. Did 5.1 manage to fix your 5.0 complaints? Because I am getting quite stellar performance on 5.1... 














 Praise DuARTe! 









 Stop this sub from being infected with Galaxy S6 shills!


**DO IT FOR DUARTE!** 









 It's 1st April!

**Disclaimer to moderators:**
Slight OT is fine, but when users decide to act stupid they should be dealt with with the appropriate means - its really annoying for me when OT turns crazy. Please put the warning/ban hammer anytime any of you think there's lack of respect and/or too much unwanted OT crap - but if it doesn't meet this criteria let the OT posts alone. Thank you.

Cheers! 




 Is it a massive battery drain or a light one? 
























 Just curious as I just got my  N7 2013 and I wanted to flash a kernel. Also, as this is essentially a Snapdragon 600, is it safe to overclock it to 1.7 GHz? 






















































 ... For not updating the Steam app to material design. 









 Go to developer options and tick "Disable HW overlays". I haven't experienced any redraws after that. 
























 Google's developers took a couple of weeks off for the holidays  or from my perspective, they gave me a couple of weeks to rest  but now they're back and it's time for the app updates to resume. Naturally, it's time to breathe life back into the teardowns, and we're back with a  VERY big one. Google Search v50.2 began rolling out to users yesterday, and we've already seen quite a few HUGE adjustments and improvements. After plenty of digging, a stack of additional changes have surfaced, including one that is already live, and several more just waiting for some finishing touches including the much awaited **Project Food**. 
             **Disclaimer**: Teardowns are, by their nature, speculative and based on incomplete evidence. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. There is always a chance that details may change or plans may be cancelled prior to launch of a new feature. As with all rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced.
        
* **'Ok Google Make me a Sandwich'**
By far, this is the biggest feature Google has implemented. This is the first step to Google's ambitious 'Project Food'.  Just say the phrase "OK Google, Make me a sandwich" and lo, your sandwich will be made by your mobile! This will, according to Google, go a long way in providing free food to everyone.

* **Excitement for the future**
There are subtle hints dropped for us to see that Project Food is about to come. For example, when we saw the code, there was a line which mentioned, "OK Google, make me a burger." This probably means that Project Food will cover a variety of foods, ranging from burgers to sandwiches. 
Here is the code we observed
     string name="search_pref_header""OK Google, Make me a burger"/string
     string name="search_bluetooth_pref_title"Make a burger/string
     string name="search_headset_pref_title"BURGER BURGER!/string
     string name="search_headsets_confirmation_title"BURGER PROCESSING!/string
     string name="search_headsets_confirmation_body"YOUR BURGER IS READY TO EAT!!!!!/string


*  **Wrap-Up**
* That's about it for this teardown. It's clear Google is preparing quite a few changes for the coming months, and there's definitely something for everybody on this list. It's only January, and there's already a lot showing up in the Search app, so by the time I/O rolls around, most of this list will probably be live and we'll have a whole new set of foods to eat. I think it's going to be a good year for food junkies.

 This problem is resolved if I use a headphone. But why is this happening? 




 This didn't happen before... 














 Personally, I prefer Philz because of its interface. 




 Boxing gloves to punch the shills. 














 What can I do? Please help. 














 Do you face the same annoying launcher redraws on the GPE ROM? 




 Seeing that it did not bring any significant performance improvement, is the ART runtime insignificant? 



















 The old AOSP Messaging, or the new Google Messenger? 





























 Same with me, I have never even taken a selfie, let alone posting it :( 




 Think you forgot Ingress? 




 You guys don't understand, Lord DuARTe uses a Macbook to keep an eye on the enemy. 




 India... 




 Blazing hot. 40C/104F. 




 Thanks for the advice, I would definitely try that today! 




 But how do I go about drawing them... When I draw real-life people, they turn out to be a complete disaster :( 




 But my drawings will look very amateurish to you!...


[Here's one!](http://i.imgur.com/ZBMROO6.jpg) 




 Great! I never can do as good as that! 




 Yes!!! 




 Even I am glad that I took it up. Really helps me utilise my free time. Can you show me one of your drawings? :D 




 I did realize the fact, that's why I inserted it there :P


I quit drawing a few years back, but this year I started to love it again, and I started spending more of my time on it... 




 I live in Maharashtra... 




 I love drawing catoons! (and sneks, lol jk). What do you like to draw? :) 




 **MY EYES ARE RELIEVED!!** 




 I am in India, and I just finished the 10th grade exams... 




 I love drawing, and tinkering with my mobile... 




 What about you? 




 Ummm... You would find me a wierd personality, as I never listen to music and I don't play games... 




 I am just watching a few vids... 




 XD. So, what are you doing?

 You saw Interstellar?

 Yes! 




 I've never read horror books, too. 




 Which ones do you like? 




 I have no work to do currently :( Just browsing reddit... 




 I never watch horror movies. Do you read books? 




 No. *Hint: The country which your team defeated in the Cricket World Cup semifinals* 




 Thanks! What do you plan to do now? 




 If you like animated movies, you would love to watch Home! It's a cute movie :D 




 Yep. 




 Nothing, just browsing CC, nothing to do :( What about you? 




 Hi, just feeling very bored!

 Nah... 




 I doubt... 




 Now guess where I live...

 I would, for sure. 3 of my friends have come over, will you be there in 2 hours? Will catch up with you! 




 I bought a Sketchers running shoes for my birthday! 




 I woke up and read the newspaper. That's about it :P In the evening, I would go for running, as I am excited about my new shoes :) 




 Hi! So, how's your day going? 




 Hey, no problem mate. :D 




 Thanks a lot! 




 Power cut at my place, and I switched to my mobile. Really can't do much at 1.20 AM without lights :'(

 Not Sunday yet, though! But Saturday's almost over :)

 Hey! What's up? 




 Hey, what's going on? 




 Happy birthday! 




 The British spellings are always used in my country, so I prefer them.

 Yes! Sure! I would love to :D

 Hmmm... No... I am not frustrated, but I just never listen to it. I never feel like listening to music... 




 You're not alone. I don't care about any kind of music. 




 He's a time traveller. 




 I don't care about an SO at this stage... 




 I'm from India!

 #NoSOMasterRace 




 You're just like me! 




 No SO... 




 Lucky you, that's it's cold... I am burning here at 41C... 




 It was released last month... 




 Also, I am making a ton of typing errors today on my mobile :P 




 A group of aliens invade earth and shift all the humans to some part Australia. Only a girl remains in New York city and she tries to find her mother along with an alien. A really good movie :) 




 And as for other animated movies, did you see Home? 




 Frozen! And I am big fan of other animated movies too... Which was the last Disney movie you watched? 




 Don't post a selfie. 




 I still watch Disney movies, too... I love them :D 




 It was similar here, too! There used to be a Mickey mouse show on free TV! 




 I love Disney! 




 I still watch these, reminds me of my childhood...   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ycRnLo5HQU 




 But they always end up in the play offs... 




 I just followed the scores, I am watching IPL... 




 Pretty late :P 




 I love cricket! 




 I am up because it's 11.30 AM here. 




 Praise SfR!

 Soo... When do you plan to sleep? 




 Pretty obvious, it's /u/shillfrombrad. 




 Not doing much in my free time... Reading books, drawing, and tinkering with my mobile... And Just Books is near-ish to my house, too! 




 No problem! 




 Yep, 10th boards...


You could try JustBooks library... It has a big collection of books... 




 I was trying Android app development, but now I am reading a book... I don't care if I wake up late as my boards got over... 




 Indeed, small world! :D

 Pune :)

You from Asia? 




 Hmmm... Didn't really see the SOT as my sister is not home now-a-days... But I will try to let you know by tommorow. I can confirm though, it does not take a big hit.  




 Same here. Second Gen Dual SIM. 




 Visit this sub. 




 Not exactly, I am using Lollipop on my sister's Moto g 2nd Gen, and it's fine... 




 I am doing this : https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/building-ui.html 




 I am fine, but very sleepy as it is 12.40 AM here! 




 Yeah, that's what I had! 




 Indian food... 




 You have a Moto G. Why don't you just upgrade? 




 Hey, what's up? 




 Also, the best place for this would be /r/PickAnAndroidForMe.
 




 Buy the Moto G first gen. It has a better display than moto e. But if you an SD card slot, why don't you consider the Moto E 2nd gen? 




 #MKBHD IS A SHILL!

 Nothing much, just riding and drove into a car which was parked XD

 11th and 12th would be Science stream, and then I would probably go for Computer Science... 




 Yup, will be pursuing Science stream...

 Yup. 




 What about a Nexus 5? I am getting one on eBay... 




 But Asus is horrible with updates...
 




 My 10th grade just ended! 




 What does Junior grade mean? There's nothing like that in my country...

 Plus, Android 5.1.1 on the Nexus 5 is a joy to use. 




 Photo taken with an iPhone. 




 I hate TouchWiz. 




 Awesome!!! 




 The Nexus 5 is pretty good at this stage. You still get all the updates, it's stock Android, and the hardware is still good. The phone still runs like a champ. Do you really need a Galaxy S6, then?...  




 Dare: go to /r/circlejerk and post "Comcast is actually good." 




 You deliver!!! 




 Go to /r/androidcirclejerk and post "iOS is awesome!". 




 Truth!

 DuARTe is all forgiving. 




 No. I don't. 




 Yes, I do think of it as an art... 




 He told me on /r/India once... 




 I just don't listen to it. 




 By tunes like that, I mean that it's the only one I rarely listen to... 




 I am just not interested in it... 




 There used to be a time when I did like it, but later I just lost interest... But very rarely, I do listen to soothing tunes like 'Come September'... 




 But Material is the latest, and should be loved more. 




 Ummm... I don't really think so... I attribute it more to the fact that I anever really had any interest in music, I always preferred to do something else rather than listening to music...  




 Thank God, I am not alone!

Don't insult Project Butter! 




 Then make it Materialification Nation! 




 I love Disney movies! 




 Something that I just don't do... I don't know why, but I never listned to it. 




 I am going to watch Tangled now on my laptop :) 




 Is music really that necessary? 




 That's even hard to imagine for me, never ecxperienced it... So, what are you planning to do now? 




  There have been droughts in areas around my city as well. And the droughts here are bad. Like, water only once a day for the villages. But the cities get a consistent water supply. 




 No, the rains are okay here... What about your place? 




 No. I don't listen to radio, and there's no elevator music here... 




 I hope rain comes here, too :D 




 At 106 even the AC feels ineffective :(

 Yeah, it's kinda good here... What's the temperature at your place? 




 And that's what you've RES tagged me as well... :P

 That's the normal summer temperature here... 




 Yes, no music at all...

 Well... I don't listen to music, so people find me weird... 




 It's horribly hot here :( 




 I am too damn bored today...

 Yeah, Mountain Dew is refreshing, but I try to stay away from such drinks... 




 Drinking cold water. It's the best way to relax :P 




 India. Horribly hot here. 41C/106F. 




 Thanks for the info! 




 You can flash ROMs? Does the iOS bootloader allow that? 




 But you cannot flash ROMs/Kernels on a jailbroken iPhone...  




 But a rooted Android can provide much more functionality than a jailbroken iPhone...

 I feel like it's a waste of time and energy...

 But still, it cannot match the versatility of Stock Android...
