 Don't you dare. 




 Thanks much. 




 Headunits, speakers, subwoofers, receivers, amplifiers, harnesses: I don't get it. Can anyone easily explain all this stuff to me or link me to an article that walks you through what each unit contributes? Making a car sound nice is confusing stuff.  




 Funny that would happen right after "The Gang Desperately Tries to Win an Award".  




 I clicked the picture without looking at the subreddit, and prayed that I was in /r/cringepics. 




 Is this still a Guy Ritchie thing? 




 I was at a Chili's (chain restaurant). We had just ordered a desert when the guy in front of us starting violently projectile vomiting all over his table and the aisle and all surrounding tables. Eventually the ambulance showed up and took him away. He never stopped vomiting. Worst part: we were in an alcove and he was blocking the way out, so we were trapped behind him, with our food and table puke-drizzled, for a good 15 minutes.  




 Yeah she was a bit mental. 




 Once when I was in middle school, I had an english teacher who was always getting on to me about leaning back in my chair. I didn't purposefully do it, it was just a bad habit. But after like the 5th time she had to tell me not too, she flipped out and threw a mug across the room and yelled at me saying that she wished I would fall over and crack my head open and shatter my skull because that would make me learn my lesson. She ranted on for a good 3 minutes before she just left the classroom. Everyone just kind of sat there and stared at me for a few minutes before we left. 

The next day she called me into her office and calmy, but very angrily, asked if I had been going around the school telling everyone that she said she wanted me to get brain damage and die (which she did), and I had to explain to her that considering she yelled at me in front of the entire class for five minutes, there was a good chance that I wasn't the only one that heard her wishes. She started grinding her teeth and shaking and told me to leave, and as soon as the door shut I heard her start hitting her desk and trying to hold in her screams.


Later that year, she tried to get me suspended/expelled for racism and called me in front of the principal and religion teacher and a bunch of other staff to discuss this, and they all realized she was talking out of her ass. I left that school after that year, but turned out she had some mental issues. She was fired the next year for assault with a deadly weapon (not in the classroom or anything). Her mugshot was hilarious. Always wanted to visit her in prison.  




 Why does this have thousands of downvotes? 




 What is your first major memory? 




 That's in all high school classrooms. 




 He didn't. 




 I recently worked on a movie he starred in. I wasn't very important at all but he treated me like the director whenever I talked to him. Really nice guy as far as I'm concerned.

Oh good.

 They switched Skylar's and Walter's hands. Check the lighting. 




 I saw an outtake from the scene where Mac's dad was talking to Mac and Charlie about filling up their butts with heroin and they couldn't get through it because they were laughing too hard. What other scenes have been hard to get through without cracking up? 




 Who on the show is most like their character? 




 http://imgur.com/1RgjbxV I nominate Andy Milonakis to play Frank in some kind of flashback. They're the same size and everything. 




 Yeeeeeah... I'm going to go ahead and call bullshit.  




 I love you.  




 I wasn't aware this was a thing. I should have known this was a thing. 









 That's the movie I thought you were talking about, but Not Rated is VERY different from PG. Not Rated means the it was not taken the MPAA to be rated. That movie would be NC-17. 




 ...what PG movie has a real blowjob? 




 Well, he passes here. Still not too happy with it but we'll see. 




 Great. Now I want a hamburger. Thanks alot, OP.

 That guy with the kid looked so confused and appalled.  




 This is so inaccurate. There were no exclamation marks in Max Payne 3.  




 Did you ever find out what was wrong with the kid or the family? Just mental problems or something?

 They should have gotten Jonathan Banks (Mike from Breaking Bad) to play Richard. 




 It wasn't staged. These judges are just programmed to overreact to everything that happens, and the producers let the worst go on as long as possible.

 What's your favorite movie? 




 Unhealthy food is cheaper to produce than healthy food. Even now, buying an organic, locally grown apple is far more expensive than a regular apple grown in Mexico.  




 Also, the sticky notes Hank was using in his research were yellow. 




 Yes. Healthy food would become 10x more expensive than unhealthy food. 




 Love how he just casually throws out "making a transition of authority to me" 




 You photoshop like a god. 




 Spike Lee is a racist, egotistical megadouche. Plain and simple. 




 Well, sure.

 On the other hand, I met Macklemore in the NBA store in NYC two or three days ago. Dude seemed really sad and didn't say a word as I asked for a picture. Made me feel like a bit of an asshole for asking although I've been a huge fan for a while. He was all alone and looked tired as shit.  




 Please tell me that was some kind of essay you had already written and not just a reddit comment.

 I don't think this will happen, but it's not always necessarily about bringing something new. Especially after finding so much success with Craig, I doubt they'd want to bring in someone completely different after his run is over.

 I remember this guy. He used to be full of cringe and bullshit. He would make videos where he drank two bottles of vodka with no hands in 45 seconds and crazy stuff like that, and then he would upload videos saying he would never upload a drinking video again, swearing on his mother's grave. Then he would upload two more and delete the last video. Also he ran for that "KingOfTheWeb" thing where the winner would get some cash prize, and Shoenice had a smear campaign where he would trash the people who were beating him (usually teenaged make-up gurus), and he would encourage his fans to cheat and make multiple accounts to vote for him, and then he freaked out when he was banned. I used to message back and forth arguing with him and he would constantly lie and brag about his YouTube money and how he was so much better than me because he was making his living eat glue on street corners for YouTube. It was pretty funny, and pretty sad.

 Oh yeah. One of my favorite "mind-fuck" movies. 




 Se7en is one of my favorites. Looks like im watching TGWTDT. 




 I have a kid in my class who talks like doge in public.

Everyone hates him. 




 If you are in for a longer ride and have Netflix, watch the BBC series "Luther" starring Idris Elba. Judging by the movies listed, we have similiar taste. I promise it wont let you down. It's incredibly well acted, written, and directed, and has some amazing cases and killers. The last two episodes of season two were up there with Se7en and Prisoners. Really good stuff. 




 The Strangers is the cheesiest horror movie ever. It makes no sense and it sucks. 

That came across very terse and rude. I just have strong opinions about how shitty that movie is. 




 He says, having already clicked on a close up photo of the gaping head of a penis.  




 You wouldn't need to.  




 Philip Seymour Hoffman was. Not just saying that because he just passed, but the man made great choices with his roles. I've never been disappointed with a movie he's been in. 




 Well if it's just a picture of someone warming their spoon so they can scoop their ice cream better then the caption doesn't make much sense does it.

 I could care less about the bat-shit storyline. The gameplay is phenomenal, though. I've put a lot of time into it. 




 Blue Valentine and Punch-Drunk Love. Blue Valentine is just dark and sad, but Punch-Drunk love is actually pretty sweet and funny overall but it deals with emotionally fragile/disabled characters and gets pretty dark at times. 




 It's amazing to play Infamous: Second Son and then this game and think that they're from the same console generation. This game looks miserable.

 Someone else that did this recently and owned the fuck out of it was Jake Gyllenhaal in Prisoners. He added so much depth to an otherwise relatively 2D character. 




 I mean, they do say "DO NOT REMOVE THIS CARD FROM AIRCRAFT". 




 Fantastic Mr. Fox or Mary   Max. Both absolutely incredible. 




 That's not my point. Fisher is an aging, American, raspy-voiced, father. Hardy is a young Brit. I have no doubt he'll make a great Fisher for the movie, but it won't be the same Fisher from the games. 




 I disagree. Not to say that this movie will suck or anything, but it will most definitely be just another action movie that happens to have the same name as a beloved video game franchise. Tom Hardy is a great leading man for an action-thriller, but he's not a great Sam Fisher. 




 I wish they kept this a secret so the movies had more "FUCK YEAH!" moments. However, "FUCK YEAH MEL GIBSON!". I hope he's just porter again. Watching Payback Straight Up and Get the Gringo back to back make me long for more. 




 Good luck kicking Statham's or Wahlberg's ass.

 A Cartoon Network short series called "Purple   Brown", if memory serves. 




 So then what (other than morals and what not) prevents me from going to Redbox with The Princess Diaries in hand, renting Thief, taking the Thief disc and putting The Princess Diaries disc in the pouch and go claim that the previous owner switched it? 




 Not surprising considering the song was written for the movie. 




 Yeah I know. I thought that a funny 5 second clip out of context would be appropriate though. 









 I just watched Prisoners. It came out last year and I hadn't seen any of Denis Villenevue's work prior and it blew me away. I've already rewatched it and I love it. Incredible performances all around and an incredibly tight and intense thriller/mystery. For me, it's easily up there with movies like Se7en and The Silence of the Lambs.

 All due respect, I don't think "passed away'' is the appropriate term for his case. 




 I didn't see it. But there shouldn't have to be a shitty sequel just to clean up after the first film. 




 Not Viggo. His voice isn't raspy enough and I don't want to hear his country accent. Plus, he may be too old. Maybe Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Josh Brolin, or Joel Edgerton. They've all done good country accents in the past. 
























 If he's over 80, I think he's allowed to do that.

 Death At A Funeral, Fargo, Payback: Straight Up, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Man Bites Dog, and Three Kings are all dark comedies with the theme of death. Happiness is the darkest of dark comedies. 




 Ehh. Not really a comedy. 




 To be fair the original Saw was pretty good as a standalone horror flick. Once the original writers (who are doing this movie) left, the franchise turned into torture porn. 




 You should watch the movie *Downfall*. It's a German film about the fall of Hitler. It affected me in the same vein as this image, but 100x more potently. 




 I've always considered Casino Royale far superior. 




 I feel ya. It felt like an extended YouTube action short. 




 That was fucking cool. Hey OP, how drastically does your Reputation meter change? Can one lengthy police encounter seriously affect it? 




 The NPC's behavior in this is impressive. People getting their picture taken, checking their shoes for gum, scurrying in the rain without an umbrella, having realistic conversations and phone calls, all with just the right amount of population and street traffic. 

People who have it already, how repetitive is NPC behavior? And does their number increase and decrease with location and time of day? 




 No 




 The hair over the mask is the icing on the cake.

 Also just don't watch it if you have a penis. 




 Speaking of Cop AI, how is the wanted system? I hate to continue with the comparison, but is it similar to the GTA 5 star system? 




 You have really unique handwriting. I like it. 




 How's that inbox? 




 He does a stellar job in "The Hunt" as well. That movie is too damn tragic.  




 YMS did a great job explaining why he thinks it's a shitty horror film. I agree.

 That's actually someone's remix of the final product. 









 I love The Veldt. 




 Although to be fair, that would make more sense in this game on account of ctOS and all. 




 Holy shit. 




 Why 




 I hope they can get some real talent involved. 




  Autonomous Meridian Response Syndrome

 Basically it's a community of content creators who make videos of sounds that give people a non-sexual tingling sensation (similar to goosebumps, I guess). However, one of the most common an popular "triggers" of these tingles is an up-close whisper, which causes quite a few creepy comments on YouTube videos of girls attempting to help people relax.
